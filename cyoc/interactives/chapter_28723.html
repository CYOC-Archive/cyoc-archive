<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris knew that mentally, she was becoming this new version of herself. A part of her wanted to just forget her old life and embrace being a girl. This body felt natural and having Bob as a boyfriend didn't seem unusual at all.<br />
<br />
She considered whether to take this to a new level.<br />
<br />
Something in her mind said that if she wanted to remember her times with Bob in this new context that she needed to do something with him that they couldn’t or wouldn’t do as guy friends.<br />
<br />
Sex seemed an option. Chris however, found herself resisting the idea. When she'd first changed, she was her male self in this new body. At that point, sex would have seemed wrong because she didn't feel like a natural female.<br />
<br />
Now however, Chris couldn’t remember what being male felt like. Her body felt natural. The idea of sex with a male wasn’t unusual at all. However, she also found herself pondering the consequences of sex.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t on birth control. With that thought, Chris remembered thinking those thoughts before. Not only did she know that her parents would ground her and forbid contact with Bob if she asked about birth control. She also worried that even if she acquired it on her own that her parents would catch her.<br />
<br />
Then there was worry over STDs. Bob seemed safe but there was always that worry of what if, even if neither of them had ever had sex.<br />
<br />
Chris also considered having sex anyway. Then, she knew that she could get pregnant. She would never get an abortion and she knew she wasn’t ready to be a mother (even if the idea of someday being one had an appeal). Although she did feel that the idea of being able to create a whole new person inside her body was beyond cool, even though it happened all over the world every day.<br />
<br />
Finally, Chris knew that she just wasn’t the type that would ask for casual sex.<br />
<br />
A flash of memory and Chris remembered things in a new context. Now, instead of feeling guilty about being able to get away with certain things as a guy, Chris always found it annoying how guys could get away with things where if a girl did she same thing, people would call her a slut. If she asked Bob for sex and followed though, people would give Bob thumbs up, while they'd chide her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob, can I ask you a question?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, what's wrong?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
Chris took a deep breath. To ask this was for her, unusual. It was like a person that never used fowl language doing it unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I ... um...”<br />
<br />
This was getting annoying. Chris knew that being shy wasn’t going to get her the response she wanted. Dancing around the issue and hoping Bob would ask the question was not a way to live.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh to heck with it. If I asked for sex, would you say yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex? I dunno Chris I mean, if you've really changed then I dunno. You've never asked for it before. Okay, maybe we were too young but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I try something that we couldn’t do as friends then maybe I'll remember more about this life,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Bob grinned. &quot;Yeah, that is something we couldn’t do if we were both guys but, is it what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Bob shrugged. &quot;I could always just touch your breasts or something. I couldn’t do that if you were a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris didn't mind that idea. She decided to take it to another level. If she was going to find a way to get back into being a guy, she wanted one last happy time as a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get the lotion,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
Standing up, Chris walked into the bathroom and returned with the bottle. She handed it to Bob and removed her shirt and then her bra. Although she was nervous and wasn’t sure this was what she wanted, if there was anyone to do this with, it was Bob.<br />
<br />
More memories entered Chris' mind. Bob was someone Chris trusted. She'd never done this with him before. She also knew from what her friends told her that once she broke the ice, that perhaps there was no going back. However, such things became easier.<br />
<br />
Bob stood up and Chris lay down on the couch.<br />
<br />
“You’re sure about this,” Bob said.<br />
<br />
“I’m nervous but yes, I’m sure. Hey, it’s safe and, um, I dunno, it isn’t as fun for you, but…”<br />
<br />
“Not as fun for me?” Bob asked with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Oh... right,” Chris replied.<br />
<br />
Bob started by applying some of the lotion onto both of Chris' nipples. Chris gasped at the cold liquid but retained her composure. Then, Bob began to massage the liquid all over Chris' breasts. With every motion, Chris felt new memories replace the old memories. <br />
<br />
When Bob began to massage around Chris’ nipples, Chris gasped in pleasure, her legs quaking. A haze seemed to clear from Chris mind. She felt as though she were awaking from a dream. Her old life faded and her new life came into focus. Everything made sense now.<br />
<br />
After several minutes, Chris found herself wanting to take it one step further. However, she resisted. She knew she’d regret it if she did.<br />
<br />
She sat up, breathing deeply.<br />
<br />
“It all makes sense now,” Chris said.<br />
<br />
“What does?” Bob asked.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe that I thought I used to be a guy. I’m sorry for scaring you like that,” Chris said.<br />
<br />
“But what about the necklace?” Bob asked.<br />
<br />
“It must have done something to my mind, made me think that I was a guy. I can’t really remember now. It’s like waking up from a dream. I guess that wonderful massage of yours did the trick. How could I want to give something like that up?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Chris knew that as a guy, she wouldn't have to put up with that time of the month, having to shave her legs or wearing makeup. She'd also take less time when going #1.<br />
<br />
However, speaking of #1, she wasn't sure how guys dealt having that body part. Chris didn't understand how men dealt with erections. She had no idea how guy's managed to live with their bodies announcing to everyone that could see it that they were excited about something. However, Chris guessed that guy's saw that time of the month in a simular way. She was used to it, even if she didn't like it. If it didn't, Chris would panic. Just like, she realised, a guy getting worried about impotence.<br />
<br />
Chris wondered how guys put up with having to in many cases seek out dates rather then being able to let people ask them out. She knew that if a man was shy that it was problematic for him as getting relationships would be hard.<br />
<br />
Yet, Chris also acknowledged that people tended to expect girls to be more mature and that there was more pressure on her and her fellow females to get married.<br />
<br />
Likewise, she also remembered terms like 'women and children first'.<br />
<br />
In the end, Chris realized that there were positives and negatives of being both genders. As best as Chris know knew, she was a girl and that was that. She'd never be able to have a relationship with Bob in any other way that she saw as meaningful if she were a guy.<br />
<br />
That was enough to confirm that Chris wanted to stay this way.<br />
<br />
Chris thought of her question to Bob before he responded.<br />
<br />
Bob smiled. “Beats me. So, you don't think if I put that necklace on that I'll become a girl?”<br />
<br />
Chris kissed Bob on the cheek. &quot;No, I don't. That's just silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you’re okay then,&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
Chris kissed Bob on the cheek. “Yes, I’m fine. So, want to go see a movie or something?”</p>
