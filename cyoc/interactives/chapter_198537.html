<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony rushed out of his house, barely saying goodbye to his parents as he did. He raced down the street and saw his bus waiting. He ran and ran and luckily, he managed to make it on.<br />
He made his way past half the other kids on the bus, some younger, some his age, some older, and none of them knew who he was. He found a seat right at the back of the bus, must be a lucky day. He huddled himself into the corner and got out his phone to mess around with some music before he arrived at school.<br />
<br />
He was then reminded of the app he had downloaded the day before. Out of sheer boredom, and the sudden memory of that red haired girl, he opened the app. He was greeted by the same layout, but this time, the instructions were gone.<br />
There was now an empty box that read ‘Enter Name’.<br />
Sheerly because he didn’t know what else to do, he wrote, ‘Tony Smith’. The app immediately presented him with a generated sentence.<br />
<br />
‘Tony Smith is sitting at the back of the bus, bored out of his mind.’<br />
<br />
Tony couldn’t help but chuckle. Quickly looking around to make sure no one heard, and they hadn’t. He looked back at his phone, he refreshed the sentence,<br />
<br />
‘Tony Smith is a 17 year old teenager with a transformation fetish.’<br />
<br />
Tony blushed, hiding his phone suddenly. How did the app know that!? Had someone been watching him? Tracking him? He refreshed it quickly,<br />
<br />
‘Tony Smith is embarrassed about his transformation fetish.’<br />
<br />
Was this app ever gonna give this up, surely it wasn’t a big deal. He just wanted the topic to change. So he had an idea. He looked around the bus, looking at each of the passengers. His eye was caught by a random girl. She wasn’t standing out or anything, and he knew her name. He entered ‘Morgana Williams’ and generated a sentence.<br />
<br />
‘Morgana Williams is talking to her best friend Petra Tyrell.’<br />
<br />
Not much to change there… clearly Tony was very picky. He generated a new sentence,<br />
<br />
‘Morgana Williams is disgusted by her best friends eating habits.’<br />
<br />
Perfect. Tony changed the word ‘disgusted’ and changed it to ‘aroused’. He wasn’t convinced that this app would work, but the idea of controlling someone anonymously always turned Tony on. He pressed enter.<br />
Suddenly, Morgana seemed less focussed on her own phone, and stared at Petra as she ate her candy bar. Morgana seemed to be encouraging her as well, as if she wanted her to keep eating.<br />
Tony wasn’t sure if this was his doing… but he wanted to test it out a little further. He changed Morgana’s name for Petra’s,<br />
<br />
‘Petra Tyrell has been gaining a lot of weight over the last few months.’<br />
<br />
Tony was getting excited. He wanted to change some words, but opted for changing ‘months’ into ‘minutes’ to see if that affect that much. He selected enter.<br />
<br />
Petra quite literally gained pound after pound as she ate each candy bar. Her belly was genuinely expanding before Tony’s eyes. He was getting a little hard, he was struggling to hide it. What was even better is Morgana was getting just as excited by it as Tony and she didn’t even seem to be aware of it.<br />
<br />
He reentered Morgana’s name and generated a new sentence,<br />
<br />
‘Morgana Williams is getting aroused as she watched her best friend gain weight.’<br />
<br />
Tony changed ‘aroused’ to ‘fatter’ and pressed enter. Just like that, her belly was starting to bloat, her whole body was getting softer and thicker. Tony’s boner was getting more and more erect as he just stared at them. He was actually getting dangerously close to an accident, so he turned his head and closed his eyes, allowing himself to calm down.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, he felt his full on hard cock become much more flaccid, although not quite there yet. He turned to look at Morgana and Petra. He stared with his eyes wide as he saw two huge girls, spilling over half the seat with their size.<br />
Along with his boner, his slight concern was rising. He quickly entered Morgana’s name into the app,<br />
<br />
‘Morgana and her best friend are gaining weight at an alarming rate.’<br />
<br />
He had to change something. He had to think fast. Although it didn’t make sense, he changed ‘alarming’ to ‘slow’. The app automatically fixed the grammatical error, ‘Morgana and her best friend are gaining rate at A slow rate.’<br />
<br />
He watched as their rapid gaining slowed to an almost halt. Hopefully they’ll continue to grow… but he didn’t want to cause any kind of harm to anyone.<br />
<br />
Without realising it, Tony had already arrived at school. Everyone was exiting the bus, including the newly huge girls waddling off of the bus. Tony grabbed his bags and stumbled off of the bus, watching as it drove off.</p>
