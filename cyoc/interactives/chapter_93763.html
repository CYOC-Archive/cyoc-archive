<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Harder! Harder! Yes! Right there!”<br />
<br />
Erik climaxed, spattering his chest with cum. Todd pulled out with a grin. Even though they were born on opposite sides of the continent, they looked like they could have been brothers. They both had the same dark hair, same lean swimmer’s body, and the same sing-songy tone in their voice. Except for the fact that Todd was taller and Erik had a short, trimmed beard, they could have passed for mirror images of each other.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna go clean off, then you can take care of me. Sound good, fiancé?” Todd said, twisting his shiny new ring on his finger. Erik grinned and nodded like an eager puppy dog. With that, Todd vanished into the adjoining bathroom. A cloud of steam billowed from beneath the door. Erik sighed contentedly and peeked through the curtains at the endless, moonlit California surf outside their hotel window; He has certainly made the right choice, proposing to Todd while they were on vacation. This had been the most romantic weekend of his life.<br />
<br />
As he wiped himself down with one of the complementary towels, he opened up his laptop to check his email. He’d been waiting for a shipping confirmation on an engagement present, but the only email he had was from his friend Marcus. The subject line read “Bro, check this out.”<br />
<br />
He assumed it was a virus, because he was pretty sure that if Marcus ever said the word “bro,” in real life, he would gag on his own tongue. But the body of the email read “This reminds me of that weekend in Tribeca ;)” along with a video link. Only Marcus knew about the time Erik had been so drunk he flashed their waiter, so he figured the link was trustworthy.<br />
<br />
He clicked and opened a video from some channel he had never heard of: Nickpix. The guy was spewing some pretty awful, hateful stuff, but Erik couldn’t help but laugh at the poor, misinformed guy’s jiggling wardrobe malfunction. When the video ended, he chuckled and shut the laptop before being hit with a wave of horniness unlike anything he’d ever felt before.<br />
<br />
Even though he’d just had sex, his cock stood at attention, throbbing painfully as if he’d never orgasmed in his life. He took this in stride, but his need was so urgent he decided not to wait for Todd to get out of the shower. He began to stroke, imagining Todd soaping himself up, muscular torso glistening and cock standing straight, ready for the attentions of his new fiancé. But to his consternation, this mental image wasn’t doing anything for him. The overwhelming need grew and grew, but his mind suddenly became cluttered with images of busty women mud wrestling, making out, riding the hoods of monster trucks, and just being generally indecent.<br />
<br />
This new urge shocked Erik, but his body flushed with the most intense orgasm he had ever experienced. He tingled with erotic pleasure. Weirdly, the tingling didn’t stop after the last squirts of cum dripped onto his smooth chest. Groaning, he stood and reached for the towel, but in its place he saw a black leather gun belt that most definitely hadn’t been there before. He didn’t even play violent video games, much less own a gun!<br />
<br />
However, upon seeing this particular firearm, his mind began to blossom with memories of loading it, cleaning it, and spending countless hours squeezing it off at the firing range. A flicker of motion caught his eye in the bureau mirror. He looked up to see that his beard was receding, by now only the length of a decent stubble. The hair on his chin and cheeks vanished completely, leaving only a thick blonde mustache on his upper lip. Wait, blonde?<br />
<br />
Erik glanced up to see his messy dark hair fading to a sun-kissed blonde, retracting into a flattering, but conservative crew cut. A sudden pain caused him to double over, and when he stood up again, he had reached a new height of six feet, now towering over the bureau. He gained a little weight, but his muscle increased alongside it, so that his barrel chest and strong core were now hidden beneath an insulating layer of fat.<br />
<br />
His flaccid cock began to inflate, extending two inches toward the floor. He grinned at its new heft as it disappeared behind a crisp, white jock strap. He blinked, and black pants and a police jacket appeared, barely concealing his bulging, muscular frame. Cockily, he strode over to the bureau, picked up a hat and a pair of sunglasses. When he put them on, the transformation was complete.<br />
Officer Erikson, the rippling blonde stud, fastened his belt around his waist and flicked on his walkie talkie. <br />
<br />
A sudden noise from the bathroom door caused him to turn. Todd stepped out, dripping wet, his erection throbbing and firm.<br />
<br />
“Alright big boy, you’d better get that sweet mouth ready for action-“ He froze. “Who the hell are you?”<br />
<br />
Officer Erikson lunged toward Todd, grabbing him roughly and handcuffing his wrists behind his back. His voice erupted in a gruff bark. “You are under arrest for indecent exposure and trespassing on private property.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about? I was just-“ Todd struggled against the restraints, attempting to body slam the cop.<br />
<br />
“Do you want me to add assaulting a police officer to that list?” spat the cop, “Now come with me.”<br />
<br />
Roughly, Officer Erikson shoved Todd out the door and down the stairs, bundling him into the back of a police car parked outside.<br />
<br />
“There must be some mistake, sir!” cried Todd. “I was just here with my boyfriend. We were-“<br />
<br />
“So, you’re a faggot. I figured as much. It’s a good thing I stopped you before you could do anything perverted to someone more defenseless than me.”<br />
<br />
“But I wasn’t doing anything! I was just taking a shower-“<br />
<br />
“In my room? Shut up fag, if you know what’s good for you.”<br />
<br />
With that, Todd grew quiet. He knew it was useless to talk back, and a pang in his stomach distracted him from the conversation. He just wished he had been given a chance to put his clothes on. He was freezing, and he was pretty sure the officer had turned up the AC on purpose.<br />
<br />
Something tickled his ears, and he absent-mindedly wished he could scratch them. He was too preoccupied with the pain in his stomach and the chill in his bones to notice that his dark hair was receding into his skull, leaving him with short, shorn bristles like a stubbly cue ball. His jaw itched as dark five-o’clock shadow grew in and it widened with a cracking sound, giving him a broad, intimidating face. His nose bent to one side, as if it had been broken before, and a scar split his lower lip. His new look was rough-and-tumble, but he felt a sudden surge of confidence that he was irresistibly handsome.<br />
<br />
The next pain came from his thin wrists as the cold metal cuffs bit into them. He tried to wriggle free, but the cuffs fit firmly around his slowly inflating forearms, which itched as long dark hairs grew across their broad expanse. His biceps became like bowling balls and his shoulders expanded to twice their size. He looked like a shaved gorilla.<br />
<br />
As he struggled against his restraints, his body continued to grow wider, though he never increased in height. His pecs expanded and became thick and meaty, as coarse curly hairs sprouted sparsely between them. His abs erupted from his flat stomach one by one, like dough rising in an oven, glistening with sweat. His legs ached as his calves became hard like diamonds beneath thick, brutish quads.<br />
<br />
Last, but not least, his dick began to rise. It quickly became fully erect, but it didn’t stop there, extending three extra inches to a clublike nine.<br />
<br />
‘Oh no,’ Todd thought. ‘Not now. That officer is gonna think I’m coming on to him again…’ His thoughts fuzzed, as if being transmitted from a faraway radio station, then snapped back into clarity. ‘-But I ain’t no fairy faggot. Does he even know who he’s dealing with? I’m the one who banged two chicks last night. They were hot as hell, too, but I think the Brazilian one probably ratted me out on the bank job. I shoulda learned never to tell bitches where I get the money.’<br />
<br />
His mental change complete, the new criminal Todd’s chest itched as a neo-Nazi swastika tattoo inked itself over his firm pec. His engagement ring turned fluid and slid up his arm and over his shoulder, embedding itself into his skin and becoming a sexy nipple ring across from the tattoo. He didn’t mind the stinging. He didn’t even mind riding in the nude. It’d be a great story to tell chicks at parties. They’d be wondering what he looked like naked, and he would be very willing to show them.<br />
<br />
He cracked his knuckles in anticipation, and the flexing of his expansive forearms caused the aggrieved cuffs to burst open.<br />
<br />
Todd’s face lit up with a sinister grin.</p>
