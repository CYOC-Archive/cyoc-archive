<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The chocolate feels so nice, you start to wonder how it would feel on your face. You wade back into the deep end. Plugging your nose and closing your eyes, you allow yourself to drop completely under the surface.
<P>It's a strange, but fun sensation as the goo slides across your face. You try to feel the bottom with your feet, but are unsuccessful. For a moment you wonder how deep the pool really is. Then you realize that you can still taste the chocolate on your tongue from earlier, which seems strange because you thought the taste had already died off. After a few more seconds, you decide you've stayed under long enough. Kicking your legs swiftly, you break the surface and open your mouth to take a deep breath.
<P>You're shocked to realize that your lungs aren't pulling any air in. You open your mouth as wide as possible, but nothing changes You can't even breathe out. You panic, rapidly paddling across the water until you can walk on the bottom of the shallow end and stand up. You grab your neck, willing yourself to breathe, but nothing. You can't even hear yourself choke.
<P>You're so scared that you can't think. You need to breathe. If you don't, you're going to die! You try the Heimlich on yourself, but it doesn't have any effect. The chocolate taste is still in your mouth. You had your mouth closed while you were under, but maybe some chocolate seeped in anyway. If you swallowed too much chocolate, it might be too late. It's gumming up your throat and your lungs and there's nothing you can do.
<P>You wade through the breast-high chocolate toward the nearest edge. You don't know if pulling yourself out will change anything, but you have to try something. The chocolate is so thick it's weighing you down. It's even harder than trying to walk through water. You don't think you can make it.
<P>You're almost to the edge when you realize something. You haven't gotten dizzy yet. In fact, your strength hasn't faltered and your vision is still completely clear. But how? You've been without oxygen for going on three minutes.
<P>You stop. You try to breathe again, but your lungs don't expand. What's happening to you?
<P>Your panic is subsiding, but your confusion is only getting worse. You slowly try to make your way to the stairs. Even though you don't feel delirious, something definitely seems different about your movements. You feel slower. Heavier. It's just the slightest bit harder to wade through the pool, just enough for you to notice it.
<P>As you take the steps up and out of the chocolate, you start to feel a little normal again. The less of you that's in the pool, the less friction you're up against and the freer you can move. What's more, the fact that you're not breathing is starting to feel normal.
<P>Your chocolate-drenched body takes its final step out of the pool. You take a few more steps and then turn around to look at it once more. It looks the same as it did before you entered it...but you realize that's exactly what bothers you. There are no brown footprints leading away from the staircase.
<P>You glance down to look at your feet, but something else catches your attention instead. Your body is considerably swollen. Your breasts are a size too big, your arms look just a slight bit bulkier, and your stomach has gained a minor but clearly visible paunch.
<P>"What the hell is happening?" you want to say out loud, but no sound escapes your flapping lips. You open your mouth wide and try to scream, but nothing happens.
<P>You regard your chocolate-encased form once more, remembering that you're not leaving footprints. You look at each of your feet, attached to slightly thicker than usual legs. The milk coating looks like it's hardened, but it's not cracking. You try to peel some chocolate off your arm. You dig at it with your chocolate fingers, and it eventually starts to give way. You dig a deeper and deeper hole into your arm near your left wrist, but you can't find your skin. You've already gone much further than you should have been able to.
<P>A frightening thought crosses your mind. "Impossible," you think to yourself, and your lips form the word even though your voice doesn't accompany them. Tentatively, you sit down on the marble floor and grasp your right little toe. You slowly bend it backward. You feel nothing save the sensation of your fingers touching your toe. You bend it back further than what should be possible. Closing your eyes and clenching your teeth, you pull at your toe. It breaks off in your hand.
<P>You stare at it for a moment. The instant it separated from your foot, you stopped being able to feel it, but you're not in pain. You look at the part where it was broken off and are disturbed to see nothing but a cross-section of solid chocolate. No skin. No bones. No blood. Your body has somehow been transformed into pure, living chocolate.
<P>You extend your tongue to taste the toe. As you lick it, your tongue deposits a wet layer of chocolate. You taste like chocolate, but that's a moot point, as all your tongue has done since leaving the pool is taste chocolate. You use the moistened surface of the toe to stick it back onto your foot. In seconds, it's attached solid enough that you can feel it once more, and even wiggle it around.
<P>This is unbelievable. You're some kind of human-shaped chocolate bar, able to be manipulated just like the food. You don't have lungs, or probably any internal organs for that matter. How are you even able to see? To hear, to feel, to taste? If you have no muscles, how can you move? These and more questions may have to remain unanswered.
<P>You notice now that your hair hasn't yet moved behind you. Probing your back, you find that it's stuck firmly to you. It has the same shape and look of wet hair, but it can't move apart from you.
<P>You continue to regard your changes. Your added bulk was probably deposited by your interaction with all the syrup in the pool. The more you slid and swam through the syrup, the more it clung to you and became a part of your body.
<P>But how was the pool able to change you in the first place? And how can you change back to normal?</p>
