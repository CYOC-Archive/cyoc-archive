<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked to the Age package on the Chronivac and wondered what to do with it.  But as he was planning on something, he could hear the voice of his mother calling him down.<br />
<br />
“Jeff!  Sweetie!  Come downstairs for lunch!”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard her mother and realized that it was time for dinner.  Giving that, he decided to save the Chronivac for later and said, “Coming mom!”  He soon left his computer and out of his room to head on downstairs for a bite to eat.<br />
<br />
At the dining room table, he was sitting at the left side, but his father and brother wasn’t there.  His father was on a business trip and won’t be back for a few months while his older brother is a military soldier and was serving in Iraq, keeping the country safe.  Still, there was an extended side of the family that’s is comprised of four women.<br />
<br />
The first one is his little sister, Jesse, who was 2-years-old with a mess of blonde locks and baby blue eyes.  She still has baby fat on her and two baby teeth in her mouth to make her look like a young rabbit.  She could barely stand or walk and babble on without saying a word.<br />
<br />
The second one is his mother, Jaime, who is 40 years of age with dull blonde hair cut short and green eyes.  Her body looked hair, even though is a little worn in age, certain kept it fit.  She had CC cup breasts that looks a bit saggy, a curvy figure that has a serious muffin top, and arm and legs showing some tone, but was looking soft.<br />
<br />
The third woman is Abigail, who is Jeff’s grandmother who was visiting her family for the week.  She is 69-years old with salt and pepper hair all tied up in a bun and green eyes.  She was a little overweight as she could be 250 pounds with DD saggy breasts, a wide mid section, and blubber like arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Finally, the fourth woman is Elizabeth, Jeff’s great grandmother.  She was living in the house for the final years of her life, as she wanted to pass away in front of family.  At 97, she is a frail woman with bony arms and legs where muscle use to be, breasts that look nearly deflated, and ribs showing underneath her elderly gown.  Her straight white hair, which was raven black, was stringy and short while her beige eyes were tired and blurry, letting her have her glasses since she was a little girl.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to each woman and girl and sighed to himself.  Staying with women would tend to lead to some uncomfortable experience.  But it is something he needs to get use to, since her dad and brother weren’t around today.<br />
<br />
As they were eating, Jamie looked to Jeff and asked him, “So Jeff, how are things?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to his mother and answered, “Okay, mom.  I got myself and new program on the computer I wanted to try out today.  Wanting to check out the other features after dinner.<br />
<br />
Jamie heard him and sighed to herself.  She knows that she spent most of his time on that computer after school.  He really has a thing with technology.  “You and your computer, Jeff.” she said in annoyance, “Sometimes, I wonder why dad insisted that you get a computer.  I know it makes school work easier, but it always waste all of your precious time.”<br />
<br />
Abigail heard it and laughed it up.  “Oh Jamie, leave your son alone.” she said to her, “Teenagers usually go through their young lives a little differently over the years.  They tend to grow out of it from time to time.  Remember when you were his age?  You were pretty much a complete outcast who always runs away from home just to hang out with your friends in an old basement, doing a little underage drinking and smoking while listening to that grudge music of yours.”<br />
<br />
Jaime turned to her mother and said to her, “Well, I was going through those rebellious phases.  Just be glad that I grew out of it when I was entering college, and pretty much going to rehab before that.  Still, you are one to talk.  You were pretty much one of those hippies that left your family just to spend years of peace, love, and music.  Really a strange time for you.”<br />
<br />
Abigail chuckled and said, “Well, I was a free spirit at that age.  Sometimes I thought growing up is a spiritual journey and you have to understand your purpose in your life.  Course, being young leads to you making some bad decisions in your life.  At least I cleaned up and had a future ahead of me.”<br />
<br />
The great grandmother just smiled a little weakly and was a little cocky on their teen lives.  “You girls and your teenage lives.  No matter how you acted as teens, y’all grow out of it.  Me?  It was completely different.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to her and was curious about that.  “How so, great grandma?” he asked her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth just smiled to him and explained about her story.  “Well when I was your age, I never had your dangle cell phones or TV or any high tech gizmos.  Back then, you had to work hard and grow up to be a fine looking woman.  And that’s what I was, a single wallflower slowly blooming out of childhood.  You should’ve seen me back at that day.  A well reserved young lady with the class and respect deserving of a grownup.”<br />
<br />
Jamie heard her and laughed it up.  “Oh, I’m sure that you were a responsible woman.  However I do believe that Jeff should’ve hanged out with us when we were all sixteen.  Sure we had different paths back then, but I’m certain that we had some adventures that my son should enjoy.  In fact, I’m certain that Jess, when she becomes sixteen, would have adventures of her own in the future.  Ain’t that right Jesse?”  She looked to the baby as she responded with a gurgle and cooing giving that she hasn’t gain much of speaking.  Jamie just smiled, understanding about what she said.  “I’ll take that as a yes.  Besides, if our own sixteen-year-old versions of ourselves lived in this year, I’m certain that we would live in a whole new world.”  The two older women nodded and thought it would be neat their teen selves would be living in the year 2017.<br />
<br />
Jeff listened to their conversation and heard about what three of these women did back when they were in their teens.  Just the thought of it, made him coming up with what to do with the Chronivac.  If he can not only regressed one of these women, or age his young sister into sixteen, but also bring their bodies and minds back in time and see how they would respond to living like in 2017.  Seems like the perfect experiment for him to try out.  For now, he should have his lunch before he starts to do something like that.<br />
<br />
After lunch, his little sister, his mother, his grandmother, and his great grandmother were around the house doing their own thing.  Jeff, meanwhile, headed to his room to hurried to his computer that is running the Chronivac.  Returning to the age package, he could see the list of information he needed to input his target and the age they should become.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see…” he asked himself, “Which one of my family members I should change to sixteen?  Mom said that she was a rebel without a cause back in the 90s and would be cool to see how much of an outcast she is.  Then again, my grandmother said she was quite a hippie in the sixties and was very free spirited.  Then my great grandmother has to more simple life then the others and would like to see how her sixteen year old self reacts when going a near century in the future.  Then again, I would like to see how my sister would be like a couple of years in the future.  So many decisions, so little time.”  He thought long and hard on which target he could choose to make them sixteen.  After much thinking, he came to a decision.</p>
