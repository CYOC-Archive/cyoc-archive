<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rasputin ‘s offer was a worthy thought of Hank to consider, as well the surprising news about his lifespan being enhanced to a probable seven hundred years. Rasputin agreed that Hank could retain his human ability to speak, but warned as not to talk to too many, lest he become a laboratory scientific project. He informed Hank of even a pony animal Master would own the favors of his Familiar; as all he would think of as wish, he would gain.<br />
<br />
Hank stood and watched his Familiar just fade from view; and a minute later did Rene come into the barn, she tending to her morning chores of feeding a tasty breakfast, to her two ponies.<br />
<br />
“Good morning all, how about some breakfast, a ration of hay for my mare and her lover; and a scope of mixed grains to add some health,” Rene said as she began singing a merry song as she tended to her work.<br />
<br />
Cindy was first to eating and finishing of her meal, while Hank/Henry stood plucking at his ration of hay and munching it slowly.<br />
<br />
Rene returned from her leading Cindy from the barn and through the pasture gate, as expected her mare to trot further into the green pasture. Instead, did Cindy wait by the gate for her companion stallion as brought to her!<br />
<br />
Rene stood and marveled at what her pony mare wanted; Cindy then began to whinny loudly, as calling for Hank/Henry to come and join her for a romp about the pasture. While Cindy continued her ranting whinnies, Rene entered the barn, seeing Henry the stallion still munching, and sporting quite an erection, was belly bumping it, he masturbating. “Henry,” exclaimed Rene, “Multitasking this morning, you must have a lot to consider. Maybe hearing Cindy calling for her stallion, while enjoying your ration of hay is reasons enough for having such a stoutly stiff an erection,” Rene said as was chiding her newly acquired stallion.<br />
<br />
“Some Cheerio’s in a big bowl with milk and sprinkled on of brown sugar would taste really fine,” Hank/Henry the stallion spoke, speaking in clearly annunciated English, and loud enough for Rene to hear.   <br />
<br />
Henry/Hank speaking his mind was to say more than remarkable, her hearing and seeing how the stallion worked his lips to help form words, was plainly a miracle. Having heard Henry speak, Rene walked slowly closer to him; as Henry/Hank continued munching his mouth full of hay. “Speak something more,” Rene asked, she standing there to the stall opening, was wide-eyed and visibly shaken from surprise.<br />
<br />
“Good hay, as never tasted better, and the mixed grains, Rye, Oats, and Wheat, yum,” spoke Henry the Fjord stallion to his owner and affectionate appreciator to his pony stallion’s cock.<br />
<br />
“How,” said Rene, she obviously stunned, and began feeling rather embarrassed, remembering of what and how she had fondle the pretty stud pony. <br />
<br />
Henry snorted before he inhaled and began telling Rene a partial truth of his story. “To begin my telling how I became this pony form, it happened after I found this book, a ledger of magical spells, curses, and potion making. It intrigued me, so much that I spoke one spell as a trial; and here is what you see I am now.<br />
<br />
I thought to say something when you would wash and groom me, especially after the last time. Your caressing manner of fondling my penis when it is erect excited me, as if then to offer it to you as I did with your mare Cindy. Oh, oh I know what I have would be for you a tight fit, as for sure!<br />
<br />
The Tome is what that ledger book of magic is titled; it speaks to my mind, as can listen to my thoughts. Because of what it heard you say about the silken feel of my stallion cock when you stroked it; and of my very appreciative thoughts, it contacted me with a suggestion for our mutual enjoyment. As the Tome had an idea, from knowing of my aspirations for wanting of you Rene; it had a method for you to become capable of me mating with you and without your’ being physically injured. The Tome familiar, a devil named Rasputin, would change the length and girth of my present size cock, and lesson the tight fit.<br />
<br />
His other idea was more drastic for you, as a second suggestion, he could change you to being equal of capability to accept you and my lusty desires, by becoming bodily your family’s farm newest mare pony; a thought he has considered is possible.<br />
<br />
Your transformation would require a curse, and by becoming a mare, when you lose your virginity because of me mating; your new you would be as permanent, properly a pony mare for her lifetime. A life span equal to mine as enhanced by devil blessed magic, by increasing the biblical life expectancy from three-score and ten years (70), as times ten, to us living seven hundred years. So tell me, as what do you think now of this fun-thrill of an offer?”<br />
<br />
“Oh my, an offer of such intimacy, and for seven hundred years of me becoming a pony mare for you to mate and keeping me pregnant; this requires some time to consider it,” Rene replying said to her pet pony stallion. “Come with me now, as Cindy is anxiously waiting your joining her in the pasture.<br />
<br />
“Okay Rene, as I am ready for her, as I know she is for me being near to her.” Henry/Hank said, as did whinny to his mare mate and let her know he would soon be there.<br />
<br />
Henry the stallion was hard to hold in control by Rene, she tugging at holding the stallion from bolting into a run and maybe leap the pasture fence. When finally at the pasture gate, Rene slid back the gate bolt lock and opened it for Henry to dash toward his delighted mare. The two ponies could not wait for any privacy, as each did their wildest to tempting the other as to begin mating.<br />
<br />
Maybe not a minute inside the gate and Henry was mounting Cindy, he standing as hunched snug of crotch and sheath to her rounded, muscular butt. <br />
<br />
“Neighee…!” Screamed pony stud Henry when the flared tip of his cock, he slid slick and sensual inside the vulva of Cindy.<br />
<br />
“HENRY, as whoever you were, let me say, your big cock is silkily sensual, but for me to lose my virginity to it, is not my kind of thrill; as I want more than our style of lust and a quick sex, pony relationship. My type of love comes from a man with a wife; and not a whoring mare!<br />
<br />
Seven hundred years, your devil Familiar would have you be a second class Methuselah, and a cock with by then a worn calloused tip diming your sensual thrills.<br />
<br />
No thanks stud, you stick with mare vulvas and equine vaginas, they are your best bet,” Rene giving her answer to a horny Henry, pony-at-stud. <br />
<br />
As Rene turned her back to the mating ponies, as she went away.</p>
