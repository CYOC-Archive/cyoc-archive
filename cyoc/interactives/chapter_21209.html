<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a thought that passed through Megan's mind as she contemplated what to do with Will. Since this device gave her almost endless possibilities to change Will in whatever manner she pleased, it excited her. &quot;Now, what would freak Will out the most...hmm..&quot; She said sitting back, rubbing her inner thigh.<br />
<br />
Then it hit Megan like a ton of bricks, it was something that she had thought about often as their relationship had continued through the years. Will was such a dominating force, while not anywhere near overly demanding or everything, but he was always in command, always in control. The though of her being the one in charge made her body exert a small orgasm. &quot;Perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Punching away at the keys, she started messing with Will's particulars. After a few minutes, she clicked enter, watching the showering Will for his changes to begin.<br />
<br />
Will sighed, he'd much rather Megan be here with him in the shower, but his imagination would have to suffice for the moment. He began to stroke his penis, a smile crossing his face as he imagined Megan's nude body in every detail. He tried for a few moments, closing his eyes as he felt pleasure, but as he continued, it began increasingly difficult to grasp his penis, almost like it was going down.<br />
<br />
Like a wave, Will shook his head, giving up on the shower experience, it's like the thought of Megan was actually turning him off for some reason. Will ran his fingers through his hair. &quot;Dammit, I need another haircut, I just got one, two weeks ago.&quot; Rubbing the soap up and down his body, Will began to notice that his body hair was thinning. &quot;Must be from sitting out in the sun so long.&quot; Figuring that the hairs had just becoming hard to see because of bleaching.<br />
<br />
Lathering up his ass, he noticed that it felt a slight bit plump than it had a few minutes ago. &quot;Back to the gym before Megan notices.&quot; Will began to rinse of, thinking all the while that the pulse mode on the shower, while usually relaxing felt very rough on his skin. Finishing up, he turned off the shower, getting right out. Immediately he felt his nipples become erect from the sudden cold air, more so than usual however.  Patting himself dry, he looked in the half foggy mirror. Will shook his head at his longer looking hair. &quot;Damn!&quot; As he scanned himself in the mirror, noticing his once proud pecks had become a little fleshy, and the nipples seemed bigger than normal. &quot;What the hell's up with that?&quot; Looking around he noticed everything around him seemed a bit higher than before.<br />
<br />
<br />
***********************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
Megan was on the brink, she couldn't stand it, her deepest fantasy was coming true right before her eyes. While not in the slightest was she attracted to woman, the thought of her boyfriend being one was almost too much for her to handle. She had to see this in person. &quot;Wait...I got it...why not finish the experience off...&quot; She smiled, typing away before getting up and heading out toward her car. She hoped that by the time she got there that Will would not be dressed yet, luckily she lived just a little ways away.<br />
<br />
**********************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will continued to notice changes of his body, the six pack that was once very prominent was no longer there, but still firm in appearance. Thanks to the Chronivac, not all of this seemed that much out of place for Will. Staying in his towel, he headed downstairs to watch some television before he headed off to bed. Flipping through the channels, he came across MTV, shrugging he decided to watch it. He continued watching, it was a show where almost everyone was half clothed, which always caught his eye. He smiled, wiping the hair from his visual, adjusting in his seat as he watch the show, the couch seemed more padded than usual. Every few moments he would note that he was watching the men on the show more than the women and adjusted for a few minutes then went right back to it, not caring after a few times.<br />
<br />
Megan got out of the car, which was smaller to her now than when she got in it, having to adjust the seat a few times as she drove. Her transformation was more sped up than Will's, she'd made sure of that. Using her key, she walked right in, heading straight for the living room, where she knew Will was. A huge grin crawled across her now broad face as she saw the now nearly complete new Will.<br />
<br />
Will stood, turning to look at the person who had entered his home. He looked familiar, almost his identical twin, but he was dressed in ill fitting clothes, those meant for a woman. &quot;Who are you? What do you want?&quot; He said in a familiar voice, it belonged to Megan, his girlfriend. But again, thanks to the chronivac, it barely registered.<br />
<br />
Megan smirked. &quot;You might want to cover yourself, sweetheart, most woman don't walk around parading their breasts around.&quot; She watched him looking down, still not realizing. &quot;Oh that's right, my bad, hunny.&quot; She had placed a release command at the beginning that would allow him to realize what was happening at her discretion. &quot;Sweetcheeks.&quot; Immediately a look of terror came over her former body's face. Walking slowly over to the new female, her smirk remained. &quot;What's the matter, I know it's very different from your point of view, the world is very different. You look fantastic, if that helps.&quot; Megan stated, gesturing to her new erection.<br />
<br />
Appalled, Will started backing up, trying to cover his new chest to the best of his ability, but to no avail, since Megan's former chest was very ample and perky. &quot;What the hell's going on? Why am I a woman? Why am I Megan?&quot; He said, trying to not allow his emotions get the best of him and to start crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop.&quot; Megan said, immediately Will obeyed. &quot;Remove the towel.&quot; Again, Will obeyed, dropping the towel to the floor, where once was Will's proud and rather large penis, now was a hairless woman's crotch. &quot;Excellent, the modifications took effect, you're hairless on your body, say for you head. Now lets see, where to begin. Ahh yes, I'm really Megan, I've changed you so that you are now physically me, however, I've made you extremely submissive. You will listen to my every command without any second thought. Maybe if you play nice, I'll change you back someday.&quot; Megan wasn't trying to be evil, but just having a little bit of fun. &quot;You need to know what it's like to be on the other end once in a while.&quot; She studied every curve of her old body, soft skin, beautiful skin, curves in all the right places, legs that go on forever. Even the feet were perfect, petite and beautiful like her hands. The most perfect ass that he could imagine, even the right lines along the back. Beautiful face, pouty lips, perfect blue eyes, and blonde hair that cascaded perfectly down her face.<br />
<br />
Will was horrified, why would Megan do this, why would she want to hurt him. How could she do this, it wasn't realistic. Would he be trapped in this form forever. To his horror, he watched his former body strip off the ill fitting clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, get over here.&quot; Megan commanded, immediately Will obeyed, walking over to him, standing only an inch way. Megan ran her hand along his former body, groping the breasts with one hand, and the ass with the other. &quot;Now give me a passionate kiss, and enjoy it.&quot; Again on command, Will kissed Megan deeply, even frenching a couple times, to Will's amazement, he had actually enjoyed kissing a man, it had to have been the body, or Megan's command. With the hand on Will's ass, he slowly moved it along her legs, then Will's thighs, then slowly, Megan penetrated Will for the first time, a small moan escaped Will's mouth. For five minutes Megan fingered Will, with each probing finger, the moans became more intense. Suddenly stopping, Megan grinned at the new woman. &quot;That will come later my pet. On your knees.&quot; Getting onto his knees, Will had no choice but to obey, only he knew what was coming and he wanted no part of it, but then the though was arousing him somehow, to suck of his former body....no, had to be strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what to do. Suck it off, all of it, enjoy every inch of it.&quot; Megan grinned, almost irrupting on the spot. Will nodded, a small smile crossed his(now her) face as she almost enjoyed the command. She began with licking the tip, expertly at that, then she inserted it into her mouth, licking and sucking the huge member, letting every inch go into her mouth and deep throating him. She stroked it with her right hand, Megan groaned in pleasure, it was unlike anything she experienced as a woman, it was more focused, but definitely pleasurable. After moments of intense sucking Megan erupted in Will's mouth, the seed spewing out of her mouth. Will went back into focus, a disgusted look came across his face as he swallowed the majority of it.<br />
<br />
Megan grinned in the glow of the orgasm. &quot;Now....what to do with you next...&quot;</p>
