<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>Armisson Community College</b><br />
<br />
Armisson College despite its status as a community college was well regarded across the state of Washington for its science program, and being able to bring in some of the foremost minds in the relevant fields to either lecture or guest lecture. This was due to the many donations from gifted alumni, who intended to make a space in its scientific field for those who wanted to develop their skills but lacked the money for a major university. <br />
<br />
This, plus its robust arts and athletics departments guaranteed a degree of rennaissance attitude among...the majority of their attending students. There were certainly some problematic elements, as there were in many places, but most going to Armisson had nothing but good things to say. <br />
<br />
Tyler Harrison sat awkwardly in the college class, between the girl he liked and the menacing form of Steven Kincaid - who by coincidence also liked the same young woman, but who had fifty pounds of steroid-assisted muscle mass on him over Tyler. The class in question was Biochemistry, with a rather interesting and somewhat eccentric visiting instructor talking about the difference between venoms, toxins, and what kind of response they needed when someone ran afoul of one or the other. The old man, with his frizzy and wild hair, looked like almost a caricature of the standard issue &quot;Mad Scientist&quot;, all the way down to the labcoat and glasses. His name was Doctor Vincent, apparently - and he was by the way he kept switching between subjects and dithering a bit - more than a little kooky.<br />
<br />
To the right of Tyler was Eveline Johnston, easily one of the prettiest women in class. She had bright, vivacious looks, complimented by bright red hair, a substantial bust, her skinny jeans and tight black blouse complimenting the rest of her wonderfully well formed body. Just looking at her made Tyler feel a little warm below the collar. <i>Calm down, calm down,</i> Tyler chided himself, <i>Do you want her to see you getting up from sitting right next to her with your cock rock hard?</i><br />
<br />
Tyler for his part did however feel worried - which helped cut down on his insurgent arousal. He wasn&#39;t exactly one of the jocks here, being more of an effete pretty boy. His blond hair was thick, soft, and curly. His face was soft, he could never really grow facial hair that well, and his body was more lean than muscular - and like his face, he barely had any body hair on him at all. His one saving grace as things were was...well. His piece between his legs. Despite being an effeminate pretty boy by all appearances, Tyler was told by all his prior girlfriends he was spectacularly well endowed. <br />
<br />
Though this also made getting up after thinking about Eveline a little difficult. The other thing going along with that was his libido. Tyler swore, sometimes it felt like he was just a raging dynamo of a libido locked in the body of someone who may as well look like some waifish model. It was a contrast that frustrated the young science major. As far as he was concerned, none of the people he&#39;d stand to work for would take him seriously. They&#39;d assume he was...well, vapid. Unintelligent.<br />
<br />
<i>And here I am one of the few solid A students here.</i> Tyler adjusted some papers on his desk. But any notion of not being taken seriously should end after today. He intended to put himself forward after today in a pretty big way.<br />
<br />
But he had to worry about any comparison to Steven Kincaid - who might well also intend for the position. The powerfully muscled athlete sat to Tyler&#39;s left, taking the class more as something to help with a back up plan. Whatever that was. Steven skated by with a C+, and it was a pretty open secret he wielded some outsized influence due to his father&#39;s wealth. The dark haired young man however was not satisfied with being naturally physically gifted AND wealthy - so he amplified himself further with steroids. Resulting in a slightly acne pocked face, covered as much as possible via creams, and a protrusive abdominal shelf that told where he got the extra pounds of muscle.<br />
<br />
A glance to the side, at Steven Kincaid, and then a glance over at Eveline - and Tyler was delighted when he saw Eveline glance his way. Not even at Steven or anything. He knew Kincaid had been trying to get with Eveline for some time, but she&#39;d not committed. And if there was anything Tyler knew about rich guys, it was their chronic inability to take the answer &quot;no&quot;. So already, Tyler was a little worried Steven would act out just from seeing that.<br />
<br />
And going by the fact Steven snapped a pencil in his hand not long after while trying to write some notes, Tyler felt validated in his concerns. <br />
<br />
By the time that the lecture was over, with class done not long after, Tyler quickly packed his things and tried to get ready to head a different direction out from the lecture hall to his next class. He hated not getting to say anything to Eveline, or try and ask her out, but he was operating on getting himself safe from the local impulsive, literal roidraging rich boy. <br />
<br />
By the time that Tyler got out of class however, he was fast pursued by the raging young man, who didn&#39;t even let Tyler get four feet outside of class before pinning him against the wall. Needless to say, the man&#39;s eyes had been entirely on Tyler ever since that moment during the lecture. Entirely concerned with avenging his nebulous idea of personal ego rather than any concern about the class. &quot;You...little...shit!&quot; Tyler winced in pain as Steven pinned him harder, &quot;She&#39;s mine, you got that? Mine!&quot; He didn&#39;t even care he was making a scene now.<br />
<br />
As far as he was probably concerned, his dad could just buy off any potential consequences. Tyler kicked and tried to thrash to get out of it, but it seemed Steven was not letting go under most circumstances. &quot;You fairy looking little fucker keep your dirty paws off of her. If I see you so much as---&quot; He trailed off because he felt something on his shoulder. His eyes drifted toward what was touching him...and found himself looking at what, to him, seemed to be a snake, resting on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fucking shit! Holy fucking fuck!!&quot; That seemed to constitute something outside of most circumstances. It looked just real enough for Steven to both accept it as real, and make a mad dash out of the area, still screaming and checking his shoulder for any snake bites, stumbling over himself the entire way out of the hallway. Students were staring, typing on their phones, some had even videotaped the absolute meltdown that had ensued - and were probably uploading it to the internet as Tyler pushed himself off the wall.<br />
<br />
He was just about to question what the hell even happened when he saw the guest instructor, standing there with an imitation snake - likely used as part of a demonstration or something. Though it looked real enough to seem like taxidermy to a point. Likely why, with its realistic looking scales and mouth, it freaked out Steven to such a degree. &quot;Uh, sir, thanks for saving my bacon there, but uh---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no problem,&quot; the old man responded, &quot;Doctor Peter Vincent.&quot; He extended a hand, which Tyler shook, and as he shook the man&#39;s hand, he kept on talking, &quot;I was speaking with your instructor, Doctor Kent Morrow, and I was wondering if you might be available to help me around my lab...? As you might be able to tell, I&#39;m getting on in age, and some of the higher cabinets and heavier items require a young man with both a brain and some measure of physical capacity.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was almost like this was heaven-sent. This guy saved him from Steven Kincaid, and then went ahead and offered him the dream set up. If he could get an in like this in the biochemistry field, he could improve his standing and get his name out there. After all, if this guy was expert enough to be invited to talk on a dedicated subject, well, it seemed like everything was just arranging itself perfectly. And on top of it all, Eveline liked a guy who could show he was serious about moving forward in life. He knew that much about her. She didn&#39;t just get with someone wiling away their future in the fraternity or sorority parties.<br />
<br />
So maybe, if he showed he was serious - really serious - about biochemistry, he could get with Evie.<br />
<br />
&quot;---Ah yes, and I&#39;ve talked with your instructor about this. Any conflicts with your schedule vis a vis his class will be excused while you&#39;re with me.&quot; And that pretty much settled it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ve pretty much sold me on this, Doc,&quot; Tyler agreed, trying not to make it look like he was ready to start jumping all over the hallway. Before long, he and the old doctor started to walk together to talk about the specifics and how this sort of internship / assistant relationship would work. The old guy sure seemed concerned about making sure all these terms were laid out clearly, and though Tyler started to get a little tired of how wearily much the old guy tended to talk and go off on tangents, he knew he&#39;d just have to deal. Get used to it and agree - and then he could get the in he so desperately needed.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d spent so long at college, trying to make sure he got to the exact requirements to transfer to a bigger and better university. But with something like this on his record, he could have a university in his future very soon indeed - and vastly more resources for any studies he wanted to move forward with.<br />
<br />
So when the old guy mentioned going to visit the laboratory after all the classes for Tyler&#39;s day were done, he just nodded along and said, &quot;Sure Doctor Vincent, I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing what kind of place we&#39;ll be working in.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
By the time Tyler was done with his classes and headed out to meet Doctor Vincent, he was starting to wonder a little.<br />
<br />
The guy just showed up and wanted a new lab assistant...kind of convenient. But Tyler really did desperately need that foot in the door to make sure he could have some repute by the time he started pitching studies and research papers for the local scientific paper &quot;The Armisson Digest&quot;.<br />
<br />
As usual for Washington, at this point in the day it was starting to rain - with Tyler shielding his head with his backpack and jacket. The guest instructor ushered him over to the large white truck parked prominently in the parking lot out by the side of the college - to which Tyler ran over and hurriedly climbed inside. He&#39;d always hated the rain. <br />
<br />
Once the two started on their way out - and in fact out of town entirely toward a place shrouded in the hills - the doctor started to talk a bit, &quot;So in terms of your status as my assistant, I expect that you&#39;re comfortable with snakes, lizards and such on land, and crustaceans, fish as well as members of the order crocodilia?&quot; It didn&#39;t take much for Tyler to figure out what he meant. It sounded like there was to be some action related to animal specimens here. Man, that bunch of quacks led by Ingrid Whats-Her-Face would be out for blood by the end of this, if he had to guess.<br />
<br />
Tyler to tell the truth had never exactly been at home with some of the more dangerous snakes and such - but he didn&#39;t need to let that slip. He could deal with it as it came, and just apply himself as safely as possible. &quot;I&#39;m fine with em. As long as they mind my space, and I mind theirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good attitude,&quot; Doctor Vincent responded as he drove further, &quot;Only a fool tests and agitates an animal for the sake of party tricks or to show off.&quot; Even though the rain was intense, Tyler could appreciate how far up in the hills they were getting. When the weather wasn&#39;t quite so atrocious, maybe it would even be a pretty nice view. There were even some clean water lakes and ponds here that he remembered from his boyhood explorations. <br />
<br />
By the time they got to the laboratory - passing through a gate that opened right as they approached, Tyler couldn&#39;t help but whistle a little bit in appreciation. <br />
<br />
The place was a three story location - the second story having an extensive patio and set up overhanging the entrance, the entire place decorated in an appealing silvery and blue color scheme. The third story had a large sun roof kind of area at the very top, though it was not likely going to get much sun today. The place included two side exits, and was built right into the extensive natural area nearby - likely in order to observe local goings on in the ecosystem. There was a large one story building right by the side of the laboratory, connected to it by a walkway and cover - likely a utilities area.<br />
<br />
In Tyler&#39;s estimation it half looked like a place of research, and half worthy of a living space. <br />
<br />
Both the old doctor and Tyler hurried inside, managing to get in before either could be well and truly soaked, and if anything, Tyler&#39;s estimation of the place only grew as he looked around. The first floor incorporated several glass enclosures containing a number of reptilian species - with a strong light hanging overhead set to their need. There was also a seawater enclosure for a variety of fish and sea creatures that drew Tyler&#39;s attention. <br />
<br />
There were several desks that then challenged that attention, numerous samples and notes and research all laying around - chaotic, but with a certain pattern. <br />
<br />
And as if compounding his enjoyment of this place, barely even hearing the doctor going on about their fortune getting in &quot;before the storm got really bad&quot;, Tyler saw a young woman walk down the staircase leading to the second story. She had light brunette hair, dressed in a lab coat and button up shirt and dress pants - none of which functioned much to conceal what a babe she was. Tyler did still feel a sense of yearning for Evie, but there was a distinct immediate hormonal challenge now. Tyler had to bite his lip lightly and think of the many quite intimidating mambas and king cobras down there in the enclosures to not end up with a rather embarrassing erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you must be the new lab assistant. I&#39;m Natalie Vincent,&quot; she started, looking around the area, &quot;It&#39;s my job to make sure the animals are healthy and happy. I studied veterinary care during college.&quot; No way - Tyler found himself almost saying. She looked about as old as he was, a lad of 20 indeed. But she was saying she went through college already!?<br />
<br />
So on top of being a stunner, she was also intelligent...man, what luck. Tyler was interrupted from proceeding into a lewd fantasy by Doctor Vincent clearing his throat, and walking by his daughter, &quot;Yes, she is something of a...shall we say, young prodigy. She always astonishes me with how much she learns. Brain&#39;s like a sponge, I tell you - always eager to take in more knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was just fine with Tyler. Seeing that the young man was sufficiently rendered speechless, Doctor Vincent stated, &quot;Now, Natalie, how about you go ahead and see to it that the assistant&#39;s room is ready and decent for habitation. I have some last details to hash out with Mr. Harrison.&quot; A quick glance at him followed, and Tyler swore he could see the young woman wink at him, blatantly checking him out right before she left for the upstairs. <br />
<br />
She&#39;s into me! She&#39;s into me! Tyler felt like singing. But he was brought back down to Earth by Doctor Vincent stating in an even tone, &quot;Now, needless to say, you&#39;re going to be helping me handle some rather...dangerous creatures. I&#39;ve synthesized an anti-venom prototype injection that should keep you safe from any bites from the likes of the King Cobras, Rattlers or Mambas and the like. I&#39;ve tested it and seen remarkably capable results, we&#39;re just weeks away from shipping it out for major hospital use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler looked around, remembering that little poisonous detail that went along with his new job as it were. Some of these animals were...quite venomous. And he didn&#39;t want his stay here to be cut short by accidentally making a King Cobra antsy. He shrugged his shoulders right before rolling up a sleeve. &quot;Let&#39;s just get this done with. I&#39;m not a fan of needles so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Doctor Vincent responded as he fetched a needle from a rack on one of the laboratory desks. It was full of a curious looking red liquid, but mercifully the needle itself was small, created to induce the least pain possible. &quot;The needle won&#39;t hurt a bit. Just tell me if you feel anything off after injection. I&#39;ll have you sit for...five to ten minutes.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Tyler sweated it up a little bit waiting for the feeling, he gulped as the injection was made in his shoulder. He bit his lip - even though he was not feeling any particular amount of pain from the injection site, he still felt an intrinsic psychological response to the fact he was stuck with a needle. Taking a seat when offered one from a nearby desk, Tyler waited to see if there were any effects. He hoped not - this kind of a miraculous anti-venom drug could be of such great use in the future, especially with people who ended up toxified in a difficult spot. If it could be okayed for home use...<br />
<br />
If Tyler was expecting a painful response, he was surprised to feel a pleasant tingling sensation - spreading from his feet all the way up his legs, hitting his groin in a way that almost made him grunt, and then further up - making all his hair stand up. Awkwardly crossing his legs, Tyler tried again to think of something unsexy - in order to quell the swelling going on between his legs. Yet his manhood was insistent, and before long, his slightly soaked pants betrayed the sheer size he was working with.<br />
<br />
When Doctor Vincent walked back over, having checked on a snake related project, he outright chuckled at the sight of the blushing Tyler. &quot;It seems you&#39;re a gifted young man in all the right places. The ladies at that college must greatly appreciate your...gifts.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m uhh, I&#39;m decently popular, I guess.&quot; Tyler looked away. He didn&#39;t seem all that offended or confused by the way Tyler ended up...<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the effects can be rather...esoteric. Perhaps you&#39;re just having a unique chemical reaction.&quot; Doctor Vincent responded. He seemed to evaluate the increasingly curious Tyler and nodded, &quot;If you feel anything further, let me know. But for now, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re having any harmful physical side effects. After all, I&#39;d hardly call a boner harmful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot; Tyler got up and looked around, &quot;How about that assistant&#39;s room...?&quot; He was just hoping to get some privacy. Maybe find out what the place was like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes. Right upstairs and down the left hallway. My daughter should have everything prepared for you. It&#39;s a remarkable room...&quot; Doctor Vincent stated, &quot;In fact, it used to be mine, when I was the apprentice, working for Doctor Michaels. Gifted man, if even more eccentric than myself...&quot; A quick little chuckle, and he elaborated, &quot;It&#39;s a space for anything you might need. Up to and including a sleeping space. I will swear by that bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler found himself thinking about the bed, even as his unfortunate circumstance continued - and he looked back outside. Seeing the rain if anything getting worse. He scratched the back of his neck, thinking about the risks of any drive back down into town in this kind of weather. He&#39;d be a fool not to take the offer. &quot;I...think tonight I&#39;ll have to use the bed. Not exactly keen on going back out there in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you settle in well, my friend. Tomorrow we start your tenure as my assistant. Get settled in, Dinner is going to be prepared by my daughter in an hour, and enjoy your time.&quot; A certain look from Doctor Vincent let Tyler know exactly what the older guy expected that to mean. The college student looked down at his groin and sighed. The guy was a real character, a regular weirdo, but he really did need that step up. And working for someone who could synthesize such a miracle drug...! Well, it was worth a little awkwardness.<br />
<br />
By the time Tyler got into the Assistant&#39;s room, he noted it was a cozy and remarkably warm space. A heater on the ground keeping things comfy, and a desk with a laptop computer already set up. There was even a post-it note next to the laptop with the computer password included. Multiple hangers in the largely empty closet for any clothes Tyler brought over, and a small window looking outside - which still showed the ongoing intensive rain.<br />
<br />
Dinner in an hour...<br />
<br />
He contemplated what to do from here. He had some privacy here. The door had a latch lock, and he didn&#39;t hear anyone else walking around upstairs. He could do some of his research, maybe let Evie know that he had found this kind of miracle job, maybe help her get her way up too. But then... Tyler breathed as he regarded his not so little situation. Could he get away with taking care of himself here? He didn&#39;t want to make a mess on such a lovingly cared for location.<br />
<br />
So in advance he checked around for any tissue paper. Just in case he went with...that. He didn&#39;t want to go to dinner still all randy. That&#39;d make Natalie think he was some typical perverted college guy. The kind who&#39;d just go with this for the chance to get in her panties...<br />
<br />
So...</p>
