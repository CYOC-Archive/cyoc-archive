<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">          Despite the distance your eyes were keen and powerful. Among the townspeople were others.... large, bulky, furred and powerful. A strange combination of man and wolf. You could hear them, growling and ravaging. Werewolves. They were attacking the towns people! <br />
<br />
<br />
       But that&#39;s not all, you saw much more, as the werewolves bit and clawed at the people, they didn&#39;t die, they transformed as well The werewolves weren&#39;t raiding the village for food... they wanted more packmembers! <br />
<br />
      You had to do something. These people, they were being forced to change into something they didn&#39;t want to be. Just like you. Changing into a monster just because fate wanted them to.<br />
<br />
   No. You may have the body of a demon, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;all act like one and leave these people to die. <br />
<br />
             You climb down the tree and still naked, you run at high speeds towards the village. The guards were preoccupied with the werewolves so thankfully there weren&#39;t any as you arrived to the stone wall. The iron gate was closed you wouldn&#39;t be able to go through that.<br />
<br />
<br />
          You look around searching for a way in until a strange voice enters your mind. &quot;Your body is not human, find your limits of the mibd and crush them. You can do much more than you think. Jump. Jump over the wall and save them.&quot; it says. You shake your head, looking around you search for the source of the voice... but no one was there.<br />
<br />
   You look up at the stone wall, it was over ten feet high, how could you possibly even come close to jumping over that? No. You had to try Atleast.<br />
<br />
          You walk a few steps back and then run at full throttle, you wait until the perfect moment and then jump.... for a brief second you don&#39;t know where you are, all you feel is wind. Then you look down and found yourself in the air, high above the wall and its battlements. You were scared you would fall and break something but then instincts guided you as you gracefully landed on the roof of a building like a cat. <br />
<br />
   Incredible. You would&#39;ve taken a moment to be in awe over yourself before you hear the wolves howling as victory is soon to be upon them. They howled a howl of victory and arrogance. Your not sure why but you felt your self growl. They were on your new territory. <br />
<br />
       You feel a sensation rise up from your lungs, clogging your throat and before you can stop yourself you give your own howl. You howl into the air, loud and full of power and dominanc. Your cry echoes across the land reverberating across every fiber of the land around you. <br />
<br />
      Then the noise stop. The werewolves didn&#39;t know what made that noise, but they would soon find out. The next hour would be a blur for you. That howl you made unleashed something deep within you. Not a demon or a beast, but the instinct of battle. The lust for fighting, sword against sword, spell against spell, the urge to win and prove who was on top. Did every demon feel like this? Were these feelings natural? You didn&#39;t know but you didn&#39;t care either, you run to the main center, the place were all the werewolves were gathered, several townsfolk and guard were fighting against them, but most of the civilians were on the ground, bitten and slowly transforming as the werewolves curse flowed through their veins. <br />
<br />
          Still in your battle haze, you conjure Druidic magic far more powerful than you ever have before, unleashing every drop of magic as you not only tap into your natural power, but your demonic as well. The ground below trembled and shook as thousands of  thick vines emerged like a volcano up from the ground, nearly fillling all but the edges of the town square.. It was like Jack and The Beanstalk almost. The vines didn&#39;t stop there, as if alive, the vines had sharp red thorns around their bodies, and they put those thorns to good use. Moving like the tentacles of an octopus the thorns pierced the chest of both werewolves and bitten civilians alike as they rampaged. <br />
<br />
       However a curious effect happened as well. Whenever one of the thorns pierced through one of the beast, you could feel as the vines started draining and sucking, as if it was absorbing all of the fluids of its targets. The werewolves grayed and hollowed out as they were completely sucked dry from all of their vital juices. <br />
<br />
      The townspeople looked in a mixture of shock and hope as the werewolves died one by one. Some of the wolves ran away, managing to escape the vines and retreat into the forest, others tried to fight back but were quickly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of blood vines. <br />
  <br />
      There was one however that refused to die. Sliver gray fur coated its large back, scars old and new crisscrossed it&#39;s body, this werewolf was significantly larger than the others. It snarled with feral power as it&#39;s claws cut through any vines that came close to it. It didn&#39;t just defend however. It was on the offense mowing down your blood vines and making its way into the core, where the vital part of the vines layed. <br />
<br />
    You growled. This wolf was a perfect opponent. Still perched from your rooftop watching the carnage below, you leap down into the ground, causing gasps to come from the human on lookers as you raced towards the alpha. The alpha heard your footsteps and turned around. The blood vines had stopped moving on your command. You would kill him with your own claws. <br />
<br />
        You both made eye contact, hatred and rivalry between both of you. You both roared a roar of challenge as your rushed towards each other. This wasn&#39;t not like a battle between wolves. You both moved swiftly and fluidly, meeting to deliverer blows then separating apart. You gave cuts and slashes to the alpha, making sure to leave as many wounds as possible.The alpha did this too. You did your best to dodge his attacks, but he was fast, already you felt several gashes around your body, blood leaking out of them. The alpha was in a poor state too, he was old, his body while strong was weakened by the curse of age, blood poured more violently from his wounds than yours. He panted and groaned. <br />
<br />
          You too were suffering. Summoning the blood vine stalk had already made you tired. You wouldn&#39;t last much longer either. You had to end this quickly. Both of you begin circling around each other. You both knew whoever would land the next wound would win. You growled at the old alpha, feeling a determination you never felt before. You never really were much of a guy to pick fights back in school, but now you realized. You loved the thrill of battle. Not fighting in a alleyway with a couple of thugs, but to fight with the determination to kill. It was amazing.<br />
<br />
            The alpha growled at you as well, but not just filled with hatred, but also filled with respect. No one had ever killed such large number of his pack before, you felt that if you both met under other circumstances you both would&#39;ve been friends, perhaps if you hadn&#39;t found the temple before you found them. But now it was too late. You both had chosen your paths. Now one of you must die. Fate had chosen already. The alpha was the one chosen to meet his end.<br />
<br />
       With a final lunge you rush at the alpha, your lean furred form managing to dodge all of his swipes and attacks. Then, using your two demon horns on the top of your head, you grab ahold of his bigger body, and thrust your horns into his neck. The alpha stopped. Blood started to drip from his mouth, you let go of your grip and step aside as the alpha&#39;s corpse fell to the ground. Dead.<br />
<br />
        The werewolves who were watching your battle with the alpha howled in grief at the death of their master. They quickly ran back into the western gate from where they had come from and fled into the forest, now aware of who truly owned this land.<br />
<br />
     The towns people looked at the fleeing werewolves and you as well. What would you do? Would you leave or take the werewolves place and slaughter them all. <br />
<br />
      You would leave soon, but first you had to do something. You look at the giant stalk of blood vines, looking up and seeing at the very top there was a large rose, possibly the size of a house growing on the top.<br />
<br />
       You walk to the stalk, and eventually walk into it, the vines parting to let you move through and soon inside you were in a strange room that was a combination of flesh and plant. <br />
<br />
          You stand in the middle of the room, knowing full well what was about to happen. <br />
Vines around you coiled and shifted, their thorns bloated with the massive amount of blood they had collected from the werewolf massacre. <br />
<br />
                   You say the words &quot;Collect.&quot; and hundreds of vines fly towards you, their thorns piercing every part of your flesh. Despite this you actually feel an immense pleasure as the vines begin to deposit every drop of blood they collected into you. You felt that there was Atleast sixty werewolves there, a large number for a town that seemed to be unaccustomed to werewolf attacks. Perhaps the pack had migrated here from elsewhere?<br />
<br />
        You didn&#39;t know, but you did feel the rejuvenating power as blood flowed into you. Your white fur turning blood red as the amount of excess blood in you began to show. The vines were half empty at the point with you almost feeling completely full, with the amount of blood in you, a normal human would&#39;ve burst.. but not you. The blood instead of going into your physical form was &quot;digested&quot; and turned into magical power. With every pint of blood you absorbed, you became magically stronger. <br />
<br />
<br />
      Soon, the vines had deposited every drop of blood into you. You waited at the blood was fully intergrated into magic energy, the giant plant you had summoned had filled its purpose, and now was beginning to wilt and decay. The once blood-green turning grey and yellow. <br />
<br />
          Outside the towns people had already surrounded the rapidly decaying plant, all stemmed and ready for the worst. You prepared for this, and in a flash you ran through the plant, bursting through, you jumped over the twenty or so men and soldiers surrounding the dying plant and landed onto a rooftop. On fast feet, you travel between rooftops, eventually making it to the eastern northern wall, where you knew your home was. You leap into the forest, now running on all fours as you make your way back home.<br />
<br />
      Before, you were timid and scared of yourself. Afraid that dealing with demons and blood magic would cause you to turn into a monster. Afraid that you would lose yourself to your hunger. But now, you were almost englightened. If you were trapped in this world, better to live your life free than live in a jail of doubt. You would do what you want to. You would live life the way you wanted to. You may not be pure of heart, but who was? No matter what, you&#39;ll make sure you always have your freedom, unlike what Enven wanted.<br />
<br />
         You had a new mission in this world. To become the greatest thing you can be. A Demon Hunter.</p>
