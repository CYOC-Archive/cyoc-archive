<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael was looking at a ballet leotard and tutu. He knew Sara was a girly girl to a tee, and he knew Mommy- er, Chelsea signed the real Sara up for plenty of girly activities… But still, to see something so girly in his size was still a surprise. The leotard was baby pink, a matching tutu built in that flounced and bounced as Michael held up the garment in his hands… Michael even saw, nestled in the same corner he had found the leotard, a pair of ballet slippers and a duffel bag, Sara’s name embroidered in cute pink cursive… He sighed as he looked at the leotard, wondering how this whole day could get even weirder…<br />
<br />
It seemed, however, like the universe would answer that itself for the young man in the little girl’s life…<br />
<br />
Michael was surprised to hear a small knock on his open door. His head whipped, pigtails bouncing as he saw Chelsea standing there with a bright smile, “I’ve got some good news, sweetie… It seems your friends are all safe and things calmed down from that little craziness… And just in time too! I see someone’s excited about ballet practice!”<br />
<br />
“B-Ballet practice?!” Michael stuttered out, “I… I um…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you don’t have to say anything, princess,” Chelsea cooed as she walked over towards her “daughter’s” dresser, pulling out a pair of opaque tights, “I know how much you love dance class… Now, do you need help getting dressed or-“<br />
<br />
“N-No!” Michael said a bit forcefully, before adding in a softer tone, “I mean… I can do it Ch- Mommy… I’m a… Big girl…”<br />
<br />
Chelsea gave a small smile and nod, “Alright, Sara… Just let me know if you need help, Mommy’s gonna get your outfit ready for after…”<br />
<br />
Michael stood there dumbfounded that this was even happening. Was he really going to be dragged to the dance class of the little girl he babysat for? He really didn’t see any other choice… It’s not like he could do or say anything to convince Chelsea otherwise, and he couldn’t just sneak out with her being right in front of him… As humiliating as it was to go from college to ballet class… He had to suck it up and head to Sara’s dance class…<br />
<br />
He took a few deep breaths before stripping out of the cutesy unicorn t-shirt and jean skirt he had inherited from the real Sara, the light-up Frozen sneakers and knee socks following after. To his embarrassment, he stood standing in a pair of adorable pink panties with a white daisy print on them, a fact he tried to ignore as much as possible as he slid the opaque tights up his legs…<br />
<br />
The leotard and the ballet slippers soon followed, all perfectly sized for his larger male frame. As he slipped on the ballet shoes, Michael’s eyes drifted to Chelsea shoving a clean outfit for him into the duffel bag… An outfit that made him blush just thinking about it, a pair of pink leggings, the light up sneakers he had on, clean socks and undies, and a white Hello Kitty themed shirt showing the happy feline mascot in a leotard not unlike the one he was currently wearing, the shirt reading “DANCING QUEEN” in pink block letters. His face was red as a tomato just looking at it.<br />
<br />
As Chelsea zipped up the duffel bag, she gave Michael a bright smile, “There! All set… Let’s get going Sara, I know my little princess doesn’t want to be late for dance class!”<br />
<br />
Michael gave a small murmur of “right” as he followed behind Chelsea, the feeling of the tutu bouncing at his hips making him blush even more. He tried to distract himself as much as possible, but every last flounce of the satiny tutu, every last bounce of his new pigtails reminded him of how everyone saw him now… As just a little girl in a pretty leotard, heading to dance class with Mommy… Yet even through the embarrassment, he couldn’t deny it was a *pretty leotard*… Besides, as nervous as he was about the whole dance thing… How hard could it really be compared to his prior life in college?<br />
<br />
Michael and Chelsea made it down to the apartment parking lot without much issue, Michael instinctively heading to the passenger side door of the white SUV he was being led towards. Chelsea giggled softly at him as he reached for the door, “Uh, uh, uh! You aren’t big enough for that yet, pumpkin! You know you sit in the back seat…”<br />
<br />
Michael blushed, the back door opening to reveal a pink Hello Kitty themed car seat sized up to accommodate him. He should have expected it at this point, but it still stung to be shunted to the back seat, and in a car seat no less. Still, Michael knew he couldn’t argue… So, of course, he sat down in the car seat, Chelsea buckling him in and starting the car up as the radio began to blast Kidz Bop music… Chelsea beginning to drive towards the dance studio…<br />
<br />
Michael looked out the window, watching the town pass him by. To him, it seemed uneventful as ever… He was unaware, however, that the town around him had largely been hit by the Swap Wave that had hit him and Sara… A few people had made it out unscathed like Chelsea had, of course… But the town was looking drastically different than it had before, people swapped around and change by chance… A group of older women played basketball at a park in ratty t-shirts and lose shorts while their former sons sat in their mother’s former blouses and leggings discussing life… A little girl pushing her dad in a swing with a look of surprise on her face… Two teen girls went to talking about TikToks to discussing a recent football game, their dads behind them continuing the conversation and pushing new longer hair out of their faces… Yet to Michael, all of this seemed as normal as ever…<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for Chelsea to reach the dance studio, Michael unbuckling himself from the car seat and hopping out of the SUV with a small blush. Chelsea gave Michael a quick peck on his cheek as she smiled happily towards him, “Alright, princess… Have the best class, Mommy’ll be here when you’re done. I know you’ll be as good as ever!”<br />
<br />
“R-Right…” Michael said with a small blush, “Um… I… I promise I’ll have… Fun, Chel- er, Mommy…”<br />
<br />
As Michael made his way into the dance studio, he couldn’t help but feel an odd sense of nerves assault him… Sure, he was going in to a beginner dance class for little kids… But even then, he never danced before in his life! How the heck would he handle himself in ballet class like this?!</p>
