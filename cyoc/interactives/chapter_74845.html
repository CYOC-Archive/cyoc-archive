<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had to walk the perimeter of the roof, but then finally found the access door back into the building. You <br />
panicked for a moment when you couldn't find your keycard, but thankfully you'd only put it in your other <br />
pocket. You stayed on the stairs, rather than walking through the main body of the building. Ms. Adair had <br />
said that the above-surface levels were for the more standard sorts of girls, but you didn't want to take any <br />
chances. If half of what James had told you was true, you might very well already have a bullseye on your <br />
back.<br />
<br />
You made it back down to the entryway of the subterranean level without an issue, though you did get some odd <br />
looks. You tried to remind yourself that this was entirely normal; you were new here. Obviously people were <br />
going to look at you and try and see if they'd met you before, or if you were doing something out of place. <br />
You blew past Zoro, who leered at you hungrily again, pulling open Jenny's door without knocking.<br />
<br />
&quot;So..you FINALLY remembered you promised to come right back, huh?&quot; Jenny stared at the floor, then she looked <br />
up at you, her jaw set angrily.You could see traces of the animal pushing to the edge of her consciousness. <br />
She could be dangerous too, you knew. Everyone here could. &quot;I HAD made us breakfast..&quot; she said, pointing to <br />
the small kitchenette in the other room that was attached. &quot;And I waited..and waited. Eventually, I started to <br />
get worried. So I figured things were just taking a little longer than expected..and I called Ms. Adair. You'd <br />
been out of her office for an hour at that point, and now it's two hours later than THAT, and you just come <br />
strolling into my den like you belong here?&quot; Jenny got right up in your face, growling as she stared up at <br />
you. &quot;So how about you tell me exactly why I shouldn't throw you right out of here?&quot;<br />
<br />
All the adrenalin wore off now that you were safe. You started to tremble hard and uncontrollably. <br />
&quot;Jenny..I..&quot; you said. &quot;I..&quot; You struggled to make the words work, but your mind was a mass of virtually every <br />
emotion under the sun, full of conflict at every turn.<br />
<br />
Jenny's anger melted away in an instant. &quot;Hey..&quot; she said soothingly, nuzzling you and sniffing you with a <br />
concerned look on her face. &quot;Come here..&quot; she led you over to the bed, gently guiding you down onto it and <br />
curling against you. She continually nuzzled you and sniffed you. &quot;Calm down..you're safe here. You're safe <br />
with me. Remember that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded as you tried to collect your thoughts. Jenny stroked your hair as you continued to shiver a bit, <br />
far more severely than you had after Zoro had first dripped his terror into your mind. &quot;Who did this to you?&quot; <br />
Jenny whispered as she wrapped her arms around you. You took a few deep breaths, finally calming down as you <br />
nestled your face against the hollow of her neck. After another minute or two, you told her every detail about <br />
everything, from meeting James (you were quick to explain that you had no way of knowing that she had the <br />
ability to make breakfast) to meeting Judith, followed by your rescue and James' parting words to you.<br />
<br />
Jenny growled. &quot;Fucking Judith..there's a reason she only got to be with me one time. I don't appreciate <br />
illusions being cast into my mind. I'm not the only girl who refuses to let her photograph me, or be alone in <br />
a room with me.&quot; Jenny pointed to the corners of the walls. You could see some form of occult symbology drawn <br />
in each corner, though all you could tell off hand was that they weren't something simple like Futhark runes <br />
or pentacles. &quot;These keep her specifically out, or anyone who intends harm to me or any guest in my room. It's <br />
the one advantage about working with other supernaturals; they often have ways to protect yourself against <br />
them like rules they have to follow, or things they're weak against.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if she's so unpopular, why does the company keep Judith around?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wasn't lying when she said she did quite a lot around here. She's got her fingers into virtually <br />
everything. Her abilities lend themselves to gaining secrets. In the supernatural world, secrets are like a <br />
currency all unto themselves. Plus, many of the girls like working with her. She can cast illusions into your <br />
mind to make it seem like you're fucking your ideal person, or that you're not in a photo shoot. Some just <br />
don't care, and they willingly let her feed off of their energies. But all the while, she's growing stronger <br />
and nobody seems to notice or care about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny locked eyes with you, tilting your face slightly so you couldn't look away. &quot;The one thing that Judith <br />
does..she likes to tell lies that either have a kernel of truth, or that come from your subconscious. It's <br />
easier to get people to do what she wants that way. I can't help but notice that all of the things she used <br />
against you were related to me somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed hard. &quot;Yeah,&quot; you said. There really wasn't anything more you COULD say, really. You closed your <br />
eyes, not wanting to keep looking into hers. It was just too quick to be getting this attached, and you knew <br />
it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey..&quot; she cooed, rubbing her cheek against yours. &quot;It's okay. I have a feeling that her lies would revolve <br />
around you, were she to try and use her charms on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled as you opened your eyes again, finding her cheeks still slightly pink. &quot;At least James was cool,&quot; <br />
you said, starting to feel better about everything.<br />
<br />
Jenny scoffed. &quot;Hardly,&quot; she said, letting out a soft growl. &quot;Sure, TODAY he was your friend, and he did <br />
something that definitely prevented some potential bullshit from happening..but James isn't cool. He's an imp, <br />
and they specialize in chaos. He's also a pretty big liar..he can't smell stuff on you all the time. He's good <br />
at doing the cold reading technique that bullshit psychic types like John Edward do. Yeah, he could probably <br />
smell your unease..but personal information? No..he just guides you into telling him. Granted, at least he's <br />
not able to brainwash you like a succubi can, but he would if he could. You're just lucky that whatever grand <br />
scheme he concocted involves fucking with Judith. Just pray he doesn't turn his goal of chaos on you.&quot;<br />
She sighed and stroked your cheek again, kissing you very tenderly on the lips. &quot;You need to be careful Steve. <br />
Everyone here has an agenda. I'm so sorry that you were picked for all of this..&quot; Her voice was full of <br />
genuine sympathy.<br />
<br />
Of course, if everyone here had an agenda, that included her. Part of you wanted to directly ask her about it, <br />
but you knew that she might very well end up lying to you. You could still feel the vaguest remnants of <br />
Judith's energy floating around in your mind, raising insecurities and fears. Now was not the time to ask more <br />
about Jenny's own agenda. You needed a clear head for that.<br />
<br />
Jenny got up for a second, pushing the intercom button. &quot;Ma'am, I just wanted to verify that Steve is doing my <br />
shoot tonight.&quot; There was a long pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Jenny. I have him scheduled to photograph you in studio C. This is the second time you've asked about <br />
this today. Is there a problem?&quot; The voice was cold and professional, but with a hint of curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no problem, ma'am. I just wanted to make sure that no plans had changed,&quot; Jenny said, sounding relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem rather taken with this new photographer,&quot; Ms. Adair said. &quot;Are you thinking of-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can discuss that later,&quot; Jenny said, cutting her off mid-sentence. &quot;I have company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked uncomfortably at you. Clearly something was about to be said that she didn't want you to hear.<br />
&quot;I'll explain..just..not right now,&quot; she said, curling back up against you.<br />
<br />
You glanced at the clock. It was 4:45.</p>
