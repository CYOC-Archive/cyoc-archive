<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The woman turned to her screen and clicked through some through some documents. She turned the screen round so he could see it.<br />
<br />
Dan could see a graph. On one axis was age, on the other educational level. There were quite a few data points, all identified by initials. He scanned along the age axis until he came to his age, 25 years. He looked up and saw his data point marked with a neat &quot;DR&quot;.<br />
<br />
But that couldn&#39;t be right?<br />
<br />
He looked along at the educational level axis: 11th Grade!<br />
<br />
The woman was speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr Redgrave, I know this may come as a shock to you but we at NeoLife have absolute faith in our program. Believe me, this is the best and most scientific way to get your life back on track&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan considered his situation. Here he was, a 6&#39;2&quot; 210lb fully grown guy about to be regressed back almost ten years. What had he been like at 16? What had life been like for him then? He had always been big for his age, and athletic. Hell, that was part of the problem. It was in junior year that he seriously started to flunk his exams. Yeah, it made sense that was where he would need to go back to.<br />
<br />
The woman spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;The next steps should be straightforward as you have already signed the necessary paperwork. If you follow me I will take you through to our treatment facility, one quick injection and the process begins&quot;<br />
<br />
She got up, and motioned him to follow her through to the room next door. There was a couch to lie on and a male nurse who was busy preparing a syringe containing some sort of blue liquid. Dan felt oddly relaxed about what was happening. The room was softly lit, the male nurse, a little guy, said reassuring things and as Dan watched the injection finally being given he knew he was doing the right thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens now?&quot;&quot; he asked the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mr Redgrave, or perhaps it might be more appropriate if I now call you Dan, you now enter the phase of reverse growth&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reverse growth?&quot; Dan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me show you&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse opened up a laptop and showed Dan a screen showing height and weight at various ages for males. This time there was only one data point, his own, sitting squarely at 25 years, 74 inches and 210 lbs.<br />
<br />
The nurse continued:<br />
<br />
&quot;Over the next two hours the reverse growth process will take you back along this development line until you are 16 years again&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I will be the same size I was when I was 16 before?&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;More or less, I would say. Individual responses vary and the formula is designed to be very accurate at getting individuals to the desired age. The other metrics can be a little more variable, as we explained in the contract&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan felt a pang of misgiving. Perhaps he should have read the documents more closely? He dismissed the thought.<br />
<br />
The nurse spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Dan, in preparation for what will be a busy two hours for your body as it undergoes its molecular change I suggest that you take some rest. We have some new, age appropriate, clothes for you so why not change out of what you are wearing now and put this robe on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan took off his boots and socks, his tee and his jeans. He was, as usual, commando so he stood there naked and handed his clothes to the nurse. Dan took one last look at his well developed hairy arms, legs and chest. His big dick too. Goodbye to all that, or at least Au Revoir.<br />
<br />
Now, was it just his imagination or was the nurse checking him out? He tightened his abdominal muscles and felt a surge of energy going through his body. He felt amazing.<br />
<br />
He put on the robe, lay down on the couch and fell into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Two hours passed and Dan&#39;s next sensation was of hearing his voice being called and a hand on his shoulder. It was the nurse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up, Dan, the process is over&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dan slowly accustomed himself to the light. The room looked exactly as it had before. He sat up and swung his legs over the side of the couch.<br />
<br />
That was odd. Why had the couch been raised so high? His feet no longer touched the floor. He jumped down and promptly tripped in the folds of the voluminous XL robe that now seemed to reach all the way down to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Dan. It takes most of our customers a while to get used to their adjusted size&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the nurse talking. Dan looked up. Then it struck him.<br />
<br />
He was looking up at a guy who had had been at least a head taller than when he had entered the room. In fact he was so much shorter now that he was barely chest high to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something went wrong&quot; said Dan, shocked to hear how high pitched voice now sounded. I never used to be this little.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; said the nurse &quot;everything went entirely to plan and I can confirm that you are exactly 16 years of age&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued:<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, preliminary data do suggest that you may have had an enhanced response to the size reducing aspects of the preparation, we see that sometimes in our more athletic and well developed suspects, but you are as fit and healthy as ever&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I will get my old size back?&quot; asked Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will certainly grow as normal, but along a growth line appropriate to your starting size. Anyway, we need to do some checks. If you just want to take off that robe, young man&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan did as he was told. This was not at all how he remembered being when he was 16. Then he had been an easy 6 foot with the well defined musculature of the high school football champ that he was. He looked down and saw a small, almost entirely hairless, body with what looked like a tiny two inch cock and equally tiny balls.<br />
<br />
Naked, he stood and had his height measured: 62 inches. Then his weight: 98 lbs.<br />
<br />
What had he done to himself?<br />
<br />
Being 16 was going to be very different this time around.</p>
