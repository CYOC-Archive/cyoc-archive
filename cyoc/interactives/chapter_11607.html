<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake felt a little strange as he woke up. He could feel that this chest was bare and knew there was something wrong when he opened his eyes. Everything in the room was huge and seemed to be a lot taller. <br />
<br />
Trying to get up Jake found he couldn’t stand anymore much less walk. He heard the sound of a plastic diaper as he landed on his butt. He looked down at his body to see he was small and pudgy. <br />
<br />
Looking at Timmy he saw he lost a year or two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goo GA DA,” Jake said trying to ask what happened. He was making baby babble when he tried to speak. Mandy giggled when she heard him. <br />
<br />
Unable to walk to Timmy, Jake crawled over and tugged on his PJ pants to get his attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;What does your little brother want Mandy?&quot; Timmy asked looking puzzled as to why the baby was bothering him. <br />
<br />
Using the sofa for support, Jake managed to stand by holding one hand against it, then trying to speak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boo DA Goo,&quot; Jake said, as if trying to say ‘What’s wrong with you?’ <br />
<br />
&quot;Awww,&quot; Mandy said. &quot;He’s trying to say Daddy. Maybe he wants to play house.&quot; Mandy said with a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo,&quot; Jake said then patted to his diaper. Asking with his hand, ‘Why am I in this diaper?’ At least he could say that word right, He thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know what’s wrong.&quot; Mandy said, sliding off the sofa to Jake’s level. <br />
<br />
He needs a new diaper. “Go upstairs and get one please, Timmy.&quot; Mandy said in her sweet voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; Timmy said, running up the stairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Waaaait!&quot; Jake tried to say before his friend left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry big brother I change you.&quot; Mandy said with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Shocked at her words, Jake stared at her for second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gaaa,&quot; se said, trying to say ‘you?’. <br />
<br />
Mandy giggled more as she heard her brother make such cute sounds. She then took him under the arms and laid him down on his back. She put her fingers on the sides of diaper and unfastened it in seconds. She grabbed both of his legs and lifted him up as she took his diaper off like she practiced on her dolls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your wee-wee looks funny&quot; Mandy giggled as she saw the much smaller part of Jake. She then tickled his belly and sides while holding onto his legs with one hand. This forced Jake to giggle a bit as her small fingers touched his sensitive skin. <br />
<br />
Timmy came back and stared in wonder at the small baby. He didn’t have any little brothers so he never saw a pee-pee so much smaller then his own. Jake felt like this was his worst nightmare came to life. His sister and best friend were just staring at him while he was so naked and helpless. <br />
<br />
&quot;Diaper?&quot; Mandy asked Timmy. <br />
<br />
Handing the diaper to her, Timmy watched as she diapered her little brother. She was quite good. Half her dolls were diapers nearly all the time. <br />
<br />
&quot;There. Is my baby all con fee wafee?&quot; Mandy asked Jake as she allowed him to move again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bee ba goo,&quot; Jake said trying to asked Mandy to change him back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome.&quot; Mandy said with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Jake gave up on trying to talk. Maybe if he played along he have a chance. Mandy still knew he wasn’t really a baby. Jake spent all morning in Mandy’s lap as they watched cartoon after cartoon, until his mother came in from upstairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy!, how many times must I tell you not to help your brother out of his crib?&quot; she asked when she found him in her lap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorwee&quot; Mandy said sweetly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It’s OK. Just give him to me.&quot; She reaching down and picking up Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on you two breakfast time.&quot; She said looking at Mandy and Timmy. <br />
<br />
Jake’s mother carried him into the kitchen as she pulled out a old high chair that was once Jacobs’ when he really was a baby. She kept it around just in case one of the little cousins came for a visit. After she buckled him in, she started cooking. The sweet smell of pancakes filled the air. <br />
<br />
“Mmmmm,” Jake thought with smile,”Mom’s pancakes were always good.” He could taste one with butter on it right now. <br />
<br />
She then set only two plates for Timmy and Mandy both with pancakes and blueberries. Wondering where his was, Jake looked at his mother. He heard a sound of jar being popped as she opened it. It was a jar of banana baby food for him. <br />
<br />
Jake was very unhappy when his mother started to spoon feed him. He really wanted anything else than to eat then baby food. Jake ate it anyway till he felt as if his stomach was going to burst. He was now very thirsty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Such a good boy you are,” his mother commented when the jar was empty. Jake felt terrible at that point. There was pressure in his belly he couldn’t understand. It was getting more and more unbearable. <br />
<br />
Thinking he was going to mess his diapers, Jake started to cry a bit then held his stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;There, there.&quot; His mother said as she unbuckled him and started to pat his back side. <br />
<br />
A loud burp came out after a few pats on the back. <br />
<br />
Jake felt so good he almost laughed. It had felt like he was going to explode. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mandy, take your friend and go play.&quot; She said while she grabbed a small towel from rack over the sink.</p>
