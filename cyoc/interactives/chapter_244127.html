<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few minutes later, Jeff was out of the bathroom and walked down the steps to head out to the patio where the Jacuzzi was wafting.  Upon getting out, he saw quite the scene.  The Jacuzzi is already on and bubbling with rose petals decorated around it and two glasses and champaign already poured with a champagne bottle between it.  Jeff was amazed that she purposefully set all of that up and curious what she was planning.<br />
<br />
Disrobing himself, he was only dressed in his black swim trunks and showing off his DILFy, hairy body.  Looking down, he sighed as he placed his hand on his beer belly to give it a good rub.  Gone where the days of an athletic college grad.  Now he was past his prime with man boobs, a gut, and black, gray and white body hair covering most of his body.  He sighed as he knew he let himself go after having a kid with Amy.  He may not have had the hot body that he once did when he was younger, but he was happy that Amy still loved him for the man that he was.  That thought was soon shook off as he knew it was the husband side talking to him and he needs to keep that at bay.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the Jacuzzi, it was hot at first, but he was able to adjust to the temperature and walked to the other end while the glasses were next to him.  Picking one of the glasses up, he took a sip and was reflecting what a first day he expected.  The hike, the bar, the punch to the drunkard&#39;s face, it was...quite the experience.  And yet, despite all that, he was contempt with his day with Amy.  He looked at his wedding ring and smiled as all his memories were coming to him of him and Amy meeting each other in high school, dating, and then of course there was their wedding and the sex they had on their honeymoon.  That in turn led to them creating Jamie and...<br />
<br />
Jeff realized what he was thinking splashed the hot water on his face, trying to snap out of it.  He knew that something was wrong with him ever since he got to the resort with his wife-er-little sister and the more he tries to fight it, the harder it is for him to keep this other side of him at bay.  He also knew that Jamie-his mom-is experiencing the same thing as well.  He doesn&#39;t know what is wrong with him as all he did was use the Chronivac to...<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it!  That&#39;s the cause!  The Chronivac!  The same one he turned to turn his mom into a 16-year-old daughter.  The very program that detected an anomaly and create a replacement mom in Amy.  The same program that he used to turn Joey into the grandfather and himself into a father.  That could be the cause of it.  But how could that be?  He made sure that both he and Jamie were aware of the changes, both physically and mentally.  Yet for some reason, something is causing him to think he was really a husband and father and, if he was correct, Jamie is starting to think she is the daughter.  That could be the problem.  Right?<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s my hero...&quot;<br />
<br />
A familiar voice interrupted his thoughts and looked ahead to see Amy standing there with her bathrobe on and posing very sexily in her middle age body.  He was caught by surprise as he said, &quot;Amy!  How...long have you been there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled and shook her head, &quot;Not long, daydreamer.  Anything on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed and said, &quot;Nothing...  It&#39;s just...  Was wondering how things are going with Jamie back home.  I...hope she&#39;s okay.&quot;  He was half right.  He knew whatever is happening with him could be the same with her.<br />
<br />
Amy sighed and she twirled the robe&#39;s knot around.  &quot;I&#39;m sure she will be all right.  Mom and dad are looking after her.  There&#39;s nothing to worry about.  Who knows...  Maybe when we get back, she could have a boyfriend by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought made Jeff cringe at the thought of it and turned his head away.  The relfection in the mirror said the same thing and he can&#39;t possibly condone the idea of his own mother dating a teenage boy, let alone a girl.  Yet he doesn&#39;t know if it his teen side talking or the father side.  &quot;I...think it&#39;s a bit too soon to think about Jamie dating.  She&#39;s still young to think of going out with a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled and reminded him of their history together.  &quot;Oh...  You may never know...  After all, we first met back in high school when we were Jamie&#39;s age.  The same can be said with mom and dad.  If she gets someone at her age, it would be...a family tradition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only thing Jeff can do is sigh at the thought of her dating again.  &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m afraid of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy knew this was starting to get boring and decided to liven things up.  &quot;Let&#39;s not worry about our daughter.  We should enjoy ourselves while we can.  Now...Ready for your reward?&quot; she said as she slowly sauntered down to the jacuzzi and slowly untie the knot of her robe.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard her and turn his head to see her slowly approaching the jacuzzi, wondering what she&#39;s up to.  That was until she opened up her robe to reveal something that made his jaw drop.  Underneath her robe was actually a purple one piece swim suit with visible cleavage and filled out her MILF like body.  Jeff cold feel his hormones riding as Amy sultrily walked slowly over to the Jacuzzi with her hips swaying and her breasts bouncing with each step.  She took her sweet time in stepping inside as her feet started to get into the hot and bubbly water, causing her to moaned sexually in a deep and husky voice.  Fully submerged, she lightly swam over to her husband and was close to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...  Like what you see...?&quot; she asked as she raise herself up to reveal her huge assets in front of his face.  Jeff was blushing red and it&#39;s not from the bubbles.  He wouldn&#39;t believe Amy would wear something like that.  Then again, he recalled a memory of the two of them going to the beach and how gorgeous Amy looked in that swimsuit and she still is today.  But that wasn&#39;t right, he knew that it was his sister, he knew that she would never dress like that, but yet, he finds it difficult to think that.  Jeff tried to remember a time with him and Amy at their ages before he used the Chronivac, but it seemed all he could think about was their times on the beach with himself and Amy or himself, Amy, and a toddler Jamie at the beach.  He even can&#39;t control all of his urges as he could feel his crotch getting sexually aroused.<br />
<br />
Amy could feel his crotch getting erected and decided to spice things up for a bit.  &quot;Feels like someone is excited to see me.  Here, let me help you with that.&quot; she said as she grab hold of his privates and gave it a good squeeze.  Jeff bit his bottom lip as he could feel sexually arounds at the what Amy was doing and couldn&#39;t resist.<br />
<br />
&#39;No!  No!  No!  This is wrong!  I have to stop her.  I can&#39;t....let....her.....let her....let her do it.&quot; Jeff&#39;s teenage side said before his adult side began thinking louder in his head. &#39;Yes you can.  You are her husband.  You love her.  You cherish her.  You want to be with her, forever.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff gave out a low moan as he could feel his privates getting so erect.  Amy was satisfied with what she was doing and decided to seal it up with a kiss.  &quot;Kiss me...&quot;<br />
<br />
The adult Jeff took control as he looked on at his wife with loving eyes as the two planted a deep kiss between each other.  Their tongues entwined as Jeff returned the favor by placing his hand on her breast and gave it a good squeeze.  Amy groaned in pleasure as the two were making out in the jacuzzi.  Jeff&#39;s hand soon automatically wend down her stomach before reaching to her nether region.  That caused the teenage side to panic.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wait!  What are you doing.  You can&#39;t do that to her.  She&#39;s my sister!  She&#39;s...my...hot...sis...sis...wife.&#39;<br />
<br />
Before Jeff&#39;s teenage side knew what was happening, Jeff was grasping at Amy&#39;s clitoris and began stroking it as Amy moaned in pleasure.  The two soon massage each others privates while kissing each other, passionately making love in the jacuzzi.  Of course, the two of them decided to catch a break before things start to really heat up and let go of each other, laying on the side next to each other and giggled before catching their breaths..<br />
<br />
&quot;That was so good...  I never imagined being with you in such a lovely place.  You know how to treat a girl.&quot; she said as she turned to him with loving eyes.  &quot;What about you?  Do you feel any better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to her as well as the adult side took full control while the teenage side watched in the back of his mind, helpless to see what was unfolding.<br />
<br />
&#39;Look at her, you can&#39;t tell me she isn&#39;t the most wonderful woman in your life right now.&#39; Jeff&#39;s adult side said.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, I agree with you there. But....she&#39;s still....wait, was she our sister before? I remember her being our wife more.&#39; Jeff&#39;s teenage side thought to himself.<br />
<br />
&#39;Because she is.&#39; Jeff&#39;s adult side thought. &#39;And in time, you will forget all about the foolish things and accept her as your one true love.  Trust me, you will like it.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what to do.  With his body under the adult&#39;s control, all he could do is watch and hope nothing bad would happen between the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better...&quot; he said very lovingly, &quot;Thanks, love, I needed that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled as she took two champaign glasses and handed one to Jeff.  &quot;Glad you like it, my dear.  Now, why don&#39;t we commemorate our first night with a toast?&quot;  Jeff nodded as he took his glass and the two raise their glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Anniversary, Jeffy.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Jeff smile and raised his own, &quot;Happy Anniversary, Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tapping their glass, they started to take a sip of their champaign before proceeding kiss each other on the lips once more.  All teenage Jeff can do is watch on and hope that they didn&#39;t go to far.  But it was only one night of a week vacation as he doesn&#39;t know how the rest of the week will be like.  All he can do is hope for the best and expect the worst.</p>
