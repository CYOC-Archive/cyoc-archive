<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adira and Inbal went back upstairs and Adira picked up the Book of Transformations again. &quot;We need to clothe ourselves so we do not attract unwanted attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to?&quot; Inbal asked. &quot;I feel much more comfortable like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hamon will be looking for us&quot; Adira said. &quot;If we go without being clothed people will notice and he will track us down. If that happens he will transform you back into Ric and will kill me and trap my soul again. Do you want that to happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Inbal looked horrified at the prospect of being turned back into Ric. Her body felt so good compared to what it felt like as Ric. She did not want to be transformed back. She understood the need for clothes for the moment. &quot;What about your hair? she asked. &quot;It's such an unusual color that people will notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll just use the book to turn it into a different color&quot; Adira said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you need the book?&quot; Inbal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may be a powerful witch but transformations were never my strong point&quot; Adira said. &quot;I could barely manage beauty spells. That shortcoming made it hard for me to find followers. Though sacrifices were easy to find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Inbal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only girls can become my followers or sacrifices&quot; Adira said. &quot;Most of the girls in those days didn't have the seed of evil I needed for followers. Many boys had that seed but I couldn't transform them and so couldn't use them. I have a feeling that the opposite is going to be true now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if you'll find suitable sacrifices&quot; Inbal said. &quot;You won't have any trouble finding followers though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I only need two more sacrifices&quot; Adira said. &quot;I already know who I want for a sacrifice so we just need to find one more. Now we need to get ready.&quot; She used her own magic to summon clothes to her and Inbal then used the book to change them into appropriate clothes for them. With another spell from the book Adira's hair changed from silver to red. &quot;Well my hair will not give us away now. The night is young and I am sure we will find some excellent followers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adira and Inbal began to get dressed even though neither of them wanted to. Adira wore a pair of plain white panties, a matching bra, and a lightweight brown sun dress with a flower print. Inbal wore a pair of pink panties, matching bra, and a lightweight pink sun dress. They both put on brown sandals and left the house.<br />
<br />
It was a cool night and Inbal wished that she could feel it against her bare breasts and groin. After walking for two hours they heard a girl yell &quot;HELP! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP! I'M BEING RAPED!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we found our second sacrifice and one or more followers&quot; Adira said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a lucky break for us&quot; Inbal said.<br />
<br />
As they approached the spot that the screams were coming from they saw a teenage boy roughly handling a teenage girl. The girl's dress was torn and as they watched the boy tore off her bra and panties. She was totally naked now. The boy had lust in his eyes as he held her tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Mary, you know you want this&quot; the boy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO I DON'T MARVIN!&quot; Mary yelled. &quot;SOMEONE HELP ME! PLEASE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one cares what happens to you&quot; Marvin said. &quot;If they did they would be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well someone is here boy!&quot; Adira said. &quot;And I care greatly what happens to this young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin looked up as Adira and Inbal approached him. A sneer spread across his face as he said &quot;Well two more for me. You'll get your turn after I'm done with Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're done with Mary now!&quot; Adira said. Her voice was so commanding that both Marvin and Mary jumped and fell silent. &quot;That's better. Allow me introduce myself. My name is Adira and this girl is Inbal. Now Marvin I am going to offer you the chance to have anyone you want. All you have to do is swear to follow me like Inbal has and you'll have the power you crave.&quot;<br />
<br />
An evil gleam came to Marvin's eyes as he thought about it. Finally he asked &quot;I could have anybody I want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except for Mary and two others&quot; Adira said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there is a guy I've wanted to have fuck me&quot; Marvin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have him&quot; Adira said. &quot;Though it will not be in your current body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Marvin asked.<br />
<br />
Mary had been easing away as soon as she heard Adira say Marvin could have anyone he wanted. Now Inbal came up behind her as Adira looked at her and said &quot;Sleep Mary!&quot; Mary began to feel drowsy and was swaying back and forth. In a few seconds she was fast asleep. Inbal caught her as she started to fall forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we don't have to worry about her escaping we can discuss what you will become&quot; Adira said. &quot;I can only recruit girls as my followers. They get to share in my power which grows the more followers I have. If you want to share in that power I will need to transform you into a girl before you swear yourself to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll like being a girl&quot; Inbal said. &quot;I was a boy before Adira changed me and I never want to go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you had sex with a guy?&quot; Marvin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet but I hope I'll get the opportunity&quot; Inbal said. &quot;Maybe we can have sex before Adira transforms you.&quot; She looked appraisingly at Marvin. He looked like he was fourteen with green eyes and jet black hair. He had a swarthy look about him and looking down Inbal could see his dick. Marvin had evidently unzipped his dark blue jeans and his dick was standing straight out. She would have thought that it would have softened by now. His dick looked like it was about five, maybe six inches long.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can have all the sex you want after I transform him&quot; Adira said dashing Inbal's hopes. &quot;You will have all the boys you could want soon enough.&quot;  a smile spread across her face as she said this. Looking at Marvin she asked &quot;Do you want to become on of my followers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin's eyes gleamed and he immediately said &quot;You bet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a yes or a no?&quot; Adira asked with a quizzical look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a yes&quot; Inbal said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Adira said a smile returning to her face. &quot;Marvin, would you please take Mary from Inbal. She doesn't have the strength yet to carry her to my home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't people notice that she's naked and asleep?&quot; Inbal asked as Marvin took Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll cast a glamour to make her appear clothed and walking&quot; Adira said. As she caught the look of lust in Marvin's eyes she said &quot;My offer only stands as long as you do not do anything to Mary. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly&quot; Marvin said.<br />
<br />
Inbal nodded when Adira looked at her. Adira then said &quot;We will g back to my home where I will transform you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adira led Marvin carrying Mary back to the house while Inbal followed Marvin. That was done so she could keep an eye on Marvin and make sure he didn't do anything with Mary.<br />
<br />
Once they were back at the house Adira led them down to the basement and before putting Mary in the cell she said &quot;Wake up Mary!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary instantly woke up and asked &quot;Wh-where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are in my home&quot; Adira said. &quot;Put her inside Marvin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin shoved Mary into the room when Inbal opened the door. Mary started to say &quot;Hey! What...&quot; but it was cut off as Inbal closed the door.<br />
<br />
Back upstairs Adira said &quot;Remove your clothes Marvin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marvin didn't think about disobeying and eagerly took his clothes off. Inbal and Adira also took off their clothes with just as much eagerness as Marvin. Once their clothes were off Adira picked up the book and transformed her hair back to it's natural color. She flipped through the book until she found the gender switch spell she wanted.<br />
<br />
After Adira finished chanting the spell Marvin felt a wave of pleasure wash over him. The first change to happen was his hair grew down to his ass and then his still hard dick shrank down and became his new clit. His balls pulled inside him to become his ovaries. His ball sack rearranged to become vaginal lips. The whole thing moved down to between his legs. His chest began to expand until he had a pair of D cup breasts. His shoulders and chest narrowed while his arms, legs, hands, and feet slimmed. His fingernails grew out a bit beyond his finger tips. His waist narrowed and his hips widened. His face took on a more feminine appearance and his Adam's Apple disappeared. Finally he shrunk a couple of inches and his transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Adira asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Marvin exclaimed. &quot;I didn't think being a girl would feel this good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you need a new name now&quot; Adira said. After a few moments of thought she said &quot;Your new name is Marni. It means rejoice in Hebrew. Now repeat after me. I, Marni, pledge my loyalty to Adira. My blood, strength, and life are her's to do with as she pleases.&quot; Once Marni had finished repeating the oath Adira said &quot;Now to mark you as my follower. Prepare yourself as this will hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adira touched Marni above her right breast and she screamed in pain as the mark was burned into her.<br />
<br />
Adira removed her hand and said &quot;Welcome to the fold Marni. Now that I have two followers we can see through each other's eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inbal and Marni found out that they could indeed see through each other's eyes. &quot;This will be useful&quot; Inbal said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are more powers to come with more followers&quot; Adira said. &quot;When I have my thirteen followers it will be like we can be each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be awesome!&quot; Marni exclaimed jumping up into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means she likes the idea&quot; Inbal supplied before Adira could ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you girls may have sex now if you want&quot; Adira said. &quot;You will need to sleep soon though. We have to find eleven more to follow me before the Summer Solstice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we eat?&quot; Marni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot about that&quot; Adira said. &quot;I was trapped in the book for so long that I had forgotten the needs of a physical body. I suppose we should feed the sacrifices too. We do not want them dieing on us too soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you knew who the third sacrifice would be&quot; Inbal said. &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why my younger brother Hamon of course&quot; Adira said with an evil cackle.</p>
