<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff is beginning to feel the onslaught of his changes. Itching and scratching his skin crawls. Nervously he scratches were his cuffed hands can reach. He rubs his legs together as feet rub feet shaking his head the shivers run down the neck and torso to shudder off his butt.<br />
<br />
A yawn produces some gutteral growl that scares the hell out of Jeff.<br />
<br />
He's getting sleepy and knows that if given into sleep when he wakes things are going to be very different. Jeff tries his hardest not to give in to the weening whinning desire to sleep. He yawns more and more and shakes himself but the eyelids are getting so heavy they seem to be made of lead.<br />
<br />
Soon enough Jeff is limp, asleep, and hung suspended by his chained handcuffs. Sound, sound asleep he begins to snore as nostrils and sinus passages start to change.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the Professor has gone to his office and checks the Internet for the City Directory where Jeff lived. Page by page he checks till the squared in package of information showed up with the name Jeffery Allen Adams.<br />
<br />
Spouse:Jane Louise Adams<br />
Children: Allen James Adams, Joan Leslie Adams, Marvin Lee Adams<br />
Retired, previously employed as loss adjusted American States Ins. Co.<br />
<br />
The Professor was beside himself as with the little white lie Jeff made had put his entire Reformation Flux Process in jeprody. To suggest that Professor Beaker was a little pissed off was barely the tip of his anger.<br />
<br />
Page after page proved out that Jeff's children were married and had families of their own. This made him feel better as it left the wife of jeff open to suggestion. Leaning back in his office chair the Professor closed his eyes and thought of what he should do next.<br />
<br />
Time passed Jeff by and he slept for hours upon hours. Hung up like a side of beef he was oblivious to the world and with himself pumped full of the Reformation Flux, even his own self.<br />
<br />
Slowly Jeff awakened and hoisted himself to a standing position. The horrendos itching had stopped but in place to that he felt oddly warm.<br />
<br />
Blinking his eyes to open they seemed crusty. A yawn produced the same if not louder growl which made even the seated Security Guard at the door jump to alert.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh wa, harr waooo!&quot; Jeff strained to ask if he scared the Guard awake?<br />
<br />
His voice had grown deeper and lips and tongue now almost totally uncoordiated for human speach. Deep down Jeff knew he should be scared of his lack of communication ability but for some strange reasoning he cared little. As jeff lifted a hand to rub his face the sudden wonder of how long his arms had become. <br />
<br />
The handcuffs seemed to have a little more give and he fisted his hand as then rubbing the sleepy crustations form his golden eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Morning Mister Adams!&quot; greeted the Professor as he stormed into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see yo slept well, almost thirtyone hours now! Then too the sleep has allowed the Flux to do it's work, your well on the way to a good long life at the zoo!&quot; announced the Professor.<br />
<br />
As if told something he should give a care about Jeff tried to look himself over. A huge muscled chest, now black of leathery hide and surrounded by thick black hair presented itself to Jeff's straining views. A lift of the left leg produced simular results as it too was thickly covered in black two inch long hairs. <br />
<br />
The Professor walked over to be in front of Jeff. He looked at Jeff in the face and said, &quot;I know your thoughts are a good bit jumbled now but the cloudy feelings will clear. In time your ability to think and even desire will surface. I have prepared for you an enhancement to the final Flux changings!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kneeling down the Professor slipped on a pair of laytex gloves. As then with one hand taking a firm hold of Jeff's half erect pink penis, he took a seringe and plunged it into the penis about two inches form the base.<br />
<br />
Jeff let loose a screaming scream of raw pain and agony as the searing hot liquid flowed into his penis.<br />
<br />
Jeff began to hop for one leg to the other slapping his now leathery skinned feet on the concrete floor. His penis flopped from side to side as the heat grew to almost unbearible heights.<br />
<br />
As at last the heat and pain subsided Jeff strained his cuffs and shackles leaning out toward the Professor and with teeth bared he growled as if wishing to kill the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll thank me for what I just did in time, Jeff!&quot; said the Professor with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have news for you that will I'm sure agree with your male senses over time. The stupid Security Guard, his name was Thomas, and the young Nurse who added to the stupidity are now having serious thoughts about being mates for you their prime male. Sandra is mostly screaming her mind senseless as Thomas is quietly feeling his male organs fade. Both, yes both will be females for your enjoyment and when your ready I'll ship the family of Gorilla's in one expensive order. Oh bye the bye, that injection was to amke sure your sensual self will keep that almost human mind distracted often with sexual pleasures. Unlike the common apes and Gorilla' population your penis is going to be longer than and larger of girth than other Gorilla types. In fact I'd say it would look more like that of a Falabella pony stallion as that's where I took the gene pattern from originally!&quot; said the Professor as Jeff cocked his head and listened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Although you penis will remain very pink when erect the sensual feelings will replace any wonder or worry about the coloring. In fact there Jeff I'd expect the length, girth, and flared ending of the penis will without a doubt send you into some seventh heaven when mated with your females.&quot; explained the Professor to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Even as he explained the things to come Jeff began to think about having raw Gorilla sex with females and his erection began. Longer and longer his penis strained outward. Even then Jeff peered down to have his eyes widen open in excitement for what he saw.<br />
<br />
The penis was not what one might call a penis it was indeed a true cock like some horse! The black foreskin was almost a sheath in the equine sense. The straining erect shaft was now a good fourteen inches long and three inches around. The base was more like seven or eight inches in diameter as the end flared out flatened but having a rounded edge like the flange on a railroad wheel.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jeff's mind filled with a desire for wild passion as his pelvis and legs made humping actions into the air.<br />
<br />
The Professor grabbed Jeff's cock and with a good ammount of lube he let the shaft flow back and forth through his grip. As he watched Jeff's Gorilla expression he reached for a large birthday balloon and with nible action slipped it over the open flarred end of Jeff's new enlargened cock.<br />
<br />
Squirt, squirt, the flood of semen roared out the end of Jeff's monster cock. The balloon took the load and as the climax ended and the monster cock hung limp, a well filled balloon hung swaying about.<br />
<br />
A smiling Professor Beaker removed the balloon and holding it up showed the bulging red balloon to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well, better than any human might there Jeff! This will help me add to the supply of Flux formula and with this others will meet the zoo as Gorilla types too! Now just a small note that each time you have a release like this your human genes will decrease and the Gorilla genes will replace them. I suspect over the course of ten or twenty years the process will in the end degrade the human mind to that of a common zoo Gorilla. Yet though by then and after that many years of living as a Gorilla I'd expect you won't much care about the loss, even if you understood it was happening. I'll have you moved to the main cage tomorrow, have a nice day Jeff!&quot; the Professor said and walked out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raaa, haagrowl, huff and puff!&quot; Jeff's mind reeled with thoughts of being a Gorilla.</p>
