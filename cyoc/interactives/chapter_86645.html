<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The news report gave Clemens some information to think over, which was a bit helpful. Maybe not the most helpful, as the development of those Fox People Kits would probably be fairly similar to George and Molly&#39;s cubs. As he laid down and began to drift off to sleep, he got a bit of a chuckle at Jenny&#39;s question about replacing the energy he lost when he transformed. The transformation did consume energy as the Animatrix Serum and the python DNA worked to essentially reform his body into its present shape. It was something that many news reports on Animal People commented on. From what Joseph had told him in some emails from what he&#39;d learned from Molly, she had eaten just about all the meat she could get paws on after her transformation, though was slightly underweight (for a tiger) when she and George had moved to Columbia Falls. Clemens guessed that Molly Wayne&#39;s parents had either been unable to adequately feed her or worse had rejected her, but it still demonstrated that she had needed to replace the energy she lost transforming. And Clemens knew he was no exception in that regard.<br />
<br />
However, the fact that he had chosen to become a reptile, an African Rock Python, he had gained a few specific advantages that those that had become mammals or other strictly warm blooded animals didn&#39;t get. Warm blooded animals, like mammals had rather high metabolisms, allowing them to maintain a steady body temperature, but this also meant they had to meet a rather high daily calorie intake in order to maintain that metabolism. It&#39;s why predatory animals, like lions, tigers, wolves, and bears commonly ate large quantities of meat when they made kills because they would need the calories in case they didn&#39;t make a kill the next day. Snakes had the same issue with regard to the chances of making a kill, but the fact that snakes were cold blooded, this meant their metabolism wasn&#39;t as high and thus they didn&#39;t need to eat as much. An African Rock Python in the wild could kill a gazelle and swallow it whole and it wouldn&#39;t need to move for several weeks whereas a mammal would have to hunt again after a day or two. <br />
<br />
Now Clemens wasn&#39;t completely cold blooded, but he didn&#39;t fully retain the warm blooded nature he had had as a human. He was what some scientists theorized that large reptiles, particularly the large crocodilians like the Saltwater Crocodile, that their sheer size modulated their temperature to a degree. Their temperature fluctuated, but no where near the degree that a smaller reptile&#39;s body temperature would. This allowed Clemens to be more active than mundane reptiles while at the same time being able to have the pork dinner in select pieces over time and not leaving him bloated until he&#39;d digested it all. The thought of him having such a distended stomach made him chuckle a little bit, but he stifled it and drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In Columbia Falls, George and Molly had seen the program that Clemens and Jenny had seen. The segment had been part of the national news and Molly was watching it when George came home from his shift, and presently had Machli and Michael having their afternoon/evening snack as the segment came on. That created its own amusing excitement as the Fox People Kits essentially barked and yipped for their parent&#39;s attention. It didn&#39;t sound quite that of a dog&#39;s, but it was close enough. Machli and Michael could faintly hear these sounds and as they heard them, they periodically paused their meal&#39;s to &quot;rah&quot; at the television screen. George wasn&#39;t sure if they could fully hear yet, though they might also have responded to any immediate physical reactions that Molly had when she heard the Fox People kits on the screen yip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there, you two,&quot; George gave a soft chuckle and ran the knuckle of one finger against Machli&#39;s cheek, &quot;that&#39;s just the TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grah,&quot; was Machli&#39;s answer as she then rubbed her head against her father&#39;s finger.<br />
<br />
George smiled down at them and then looked to Molly. She actually looked a bit relieved, which surprised him a bit. The two of them had been fairly curious about the people who had been Changes&#39; victims, the people who hadn&#39;t been able to get away. It was partially why they had been willing to meet Miles, the brother of one of George&#39;s police academy classmates who had been caught and returned to his family&#39;s ranch after George&#39;s actions had broken up Change&#39;s scheme. That curiosity was still there and the news report did sate that. In fact, George was glad to see that at least of Changes&#39;s victims were able to get a new start on life, but Molly looked relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly... are you okay?&quot; George asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could have been me...&quot; Molly said slowly after a moment, &quot;If you hadn&#39;t come to my rescue.&quot;<br />
<br />
George figured she was remembering being grabbed and injected and taken into a back room.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I was there and Changes paid for his crimes and it&#39;s doubtful that he&#39;d be able to pull of anything like it again,&quot; George told her. &quot;And she was able to go home again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am glad to see that... and that her husband didn&#39;t reject her,&quot; Molly answered as she felt Michael and Machli begin eating again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; George nodded, &quot;very good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see her? When you and your dad went to bust Changes?&quot; Molly asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; George shook his head, &quot;but that place was huge... like a series of tents all sewn together, and I was kept near where Leona... now Leon&#39;s cage was. If Janet Miller was kept in a cage farther away... I probably wouldn&#39;t have seen her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he transformed like you did,&quot; Molly commented, rubbing her muzzle to George&#39;s, &quot;maybe a day or two after as Leona didn&#39;t make the formal announcement until after she got back to Peoria after your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way that made both happy in the long run,&quot; George nodded and let a low rumble escape his throat to let Molly know he loved her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrr!&quot; came Machli&#39;s contented response from Molly&#39;s arms, soon to be echoed by her brother. Molly chuckled at that.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see that there are plenty of good people out there,&quot; Joseph Patten chuckled to himself as he shut off his television and stretched.<br />
<br />
While Joseph knew this very well, he still knew that there were a great deal of negative and racist responses to Animal People, particularly when they turned out to be predators, but even people who had become animals that were herbivores weren&#39;t entirely immune to these things. The RAM nonsense in Columbia Falls, Clemens&#39; coworkers tricking the parents of school children to attack him, at least one report of an Animal Person being killed by such a mob and his human girlfriend beaten up had all come from some form of greed or racism... or perhaps both. Where people refused to see the control that Animal People had over their instincts and refused to believe that Animal People were still people. But Joseph was sure that much of these things were isolated. It was troubling when these isolated incidents caused trouble, but things seemed right with the world in seeing the racist nut-jobs defeated.<br />
<br />
As he made his way toward his own bedroom, he thought over some of the things Clemens had commented to him before he and Jenny returned to Florida. True the wedding wasn&#39;t expected until August, but with Molly on maternity leave, and not expected to come back to school full time until the fall school year started again, he knew there were a fairly long list of things he would need to do get organized for a trip to Florida.</p>
