<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For so long, he believed the stories recited to him to be but myths and fairytales...<br />
<br />
The rise of the Demon King, and his eventual sealing...<br />
<br />
...That great war between the gods, and the aftermath resulting in the complete decimation of their clan&#39;s ancestors… the very same which led to them losing their &quot;sacred power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tales he&#39;d believed to be but a distant memory were resurging before his very eyes… and now...<br />
<br />
Kalil didn&#39;t know how to feel, the bits of stone still clinging to his body joining the pile at his feet as he helplessly fell forward on all fours--the opened sanctuary doors revealing the fire which had ravaged the village and forest had dispelled to leave a charred husk of what once was--the clouded sky overhead and dampness in the air making it clear even the heavens had wept.<br />
<br />
His shoulders shook, as he kept his eyes fixed on the ground.<br />
<br />
Kayda was nowhere to be seen, and he knew full well she had gone through with her plan.<br />
<br />
Yet her words lingered, even as her sacrifice stung.<br />
<br />
<em>Grow strong… and never lose hope.</em><br />
<br />
&quot;Hope…&quot; Kalil whispered, pushing himself up from the ground to ponder the word, turning to observe the other awakened survivors with glazed eyes as they bickered between survival or to fight--of which the most vocal were clansmen who&#39;d tried to rally them and the old woman who&#39;d berated his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you see that Kayda saved us, you old crone?! You want to be a coward and run off, be my guest!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better cowardness than to rush headfirst to a pitiful death!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; the elder called, raising a hand to silence the pair&#39;s unsolvable argument, while also gathering the attention of his subjects, &quot;above all else, we must seek to rebuild. Kayda sacrificed herself for our survival, and we must keep true to her wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebuild? How can we rebuild when even the forest around us is nothing but ash, you old fool?&quot; The old woman snarled impatiently, before pointing upwards. &quot;Even this sacred place will not be upheld much longer! Watch as it crumbles around us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all is lost,&quot; the elder replied hopefully, &quot;the vault beneath us has its purpose, and we will use it to its fullest potential.&quot; He paused, to meet his naysayer in the eye. &quot;Escape if you wish, but know the lands outside this forest are not ones meant for our kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
While she opened her mouth to protest once more, the old woman seemed to concede as she pondered the meaning of the elder&#39;s words--grumbling under her breath as she shambled outside to be followed by the remaining villagers.<br />
<br />
Kalil remained still as he mused over the elder&#39;s words, eyes falling to the ground.<br />
<br />
A hand upon his shoulder caused him to gasp, and he spun to meet the forlorn gaze of his grandmother--who he had not realized had remained within the sanctuary as the others, bar the elder, had left.<br />
<br />
She did not speak as he met her old eyes, and neither did he as shamefully glanced away--brushing her hand off his shoulder as he halted before the ancient man clad in verdant robes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elder,&quot; the blue-haired youth began before he could speak, unable to meet his eyes, &quot;please, let me go after them. They took Kayda, she&#39;s all we had left. I can&#39;t stay here knowing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a feeling you&#39;d say that.&quot; The elder sighed, giving a curt nod, to Kalil&#39;s surprise. &quot;I heard what she told you. And seeing you now, I feel a fool for not realizing it sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The tales of the Beastblood have long been nothing but myths among our tribe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil glanced to see his grandmother by his side, who observed him with an unreadable expression, though a smile graced her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;But now more than ever, do I find Kayda&#39;s words ringing true.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;ll let me go then?&quot; Kalil turned back to the elder, the despair in his voice leaving him as his eyes glimmered with hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;I <em>should</em> try to stop you,&quot; he mused as he studied the child before him, stroking his beard before shaking his head with a defeated sigh, &quot;but, I know trying to do so would be futile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I…&quot; Kalil smiled, and he forced himself to refrain from dropping to his knees as he gave a grateful bow. &quot;Thank you, elder…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; The ancient man nodded, though his expression hardened as Kalil returned to full height. &quot;However, you must know my earlier words were no bluff; the world outside our forest is one no longer meant for us. There is no telling how much it has changed in our absence. It will not be easy to survive, especially for one so young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not despair, Kalil.&quot; The elder chuckled, as though to reassure him. &quot;There is something I wish to give you. I understand you&#39;ve trained in your spare time.&quot; <br />
<br />
As if from nothingness, from beneath his robe the elderly man retrieved a small ornate case--exterior the same verdant color as the garb of their clan and forests, engraved with silver vine-like accents. Extending his arms out to the blue-haired child, he gestured for him to open the box.<br />
<br />
With held breath, Kalil did just that--jaw dropping in awe as he lifted the lid of the case to reveal a sword of purest white--arguably the most ancient of blades he&#39;d ever seen--the silver blade contrasted by the verdant color of the guard, handle, and pommel. Empty notches sat at the center of the winged guard, their purpose he did not know as he gently lifted the weapon from its resting place, eyeing his reflection in its pristine blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;The true purpose of this weapon has been lost to time, but I know you will need it in your endeavors.&quot; The elder explained, he himself overcome with unexpressed awe as he observed the weapon in Kalil&#39;s hands. &quot;It has no name which I know of, but it will make a fine companion for your journey into the unknown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too kind to me, Elder.&quot; Kalil shook his head, feeling unfit as he tested the blade&#39;s weight, before he lowered it to his side. &quot;I cannot express my gratitude… thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elder smiled, before handing him the scabbard to the blade and turning away without further comment.<br />
<br />
Almost hesitantly, Kalil allowed the sword to rest within its sheath, and with it clutched tight in his arms he turned to his grandmother; who eyed him with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ll need a change of clothes before you&#39;re worthy of swinging something so fancy around.&quot; She muttered, to her grandson&#39;s sudden embarrassment. &quot;No grandson of mine is going out there in his nightclothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Oh, right...&quot;<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
While nearly all else had unfortunately been lost to the flames, Kalil was grateful there had been clothes which had survived the destruction of their home. He proudly wore the verdant garb common to the men of the tribe--a tunic of green decorated with various silver designs at its edges--alongside a plain green cloak of a slightly darker shade--otherwise necessary for clansmen should they seek to hide themselves as they hunted within the forest.<br />
<br />
The forest which no longer existed...<br />
<br />
The nameless blade gifted to him lay belted at his left hip, giving Kalil a feeling of safety as his hand grasped its hilt. Whatever the reality of his situation, he was confident that he could defend himself should the need arise.<br />
<br />
Tapping his boots against the ruined floor and after shaking his head, the blue-haired youth turned to glimpse his grandmother, who he had not realized had been observing him--a keen sense of pride in her old eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like a true warrior now.&quot; Her voice was quiet, but it dripped with joy. &quot;You&#39;re still short, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph.&quot; Kalil frowned self-consciously, only looking up as she held out a small satchel made of leather to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need food and coin if you&#39;re going to travel. Extra clothes, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
In silence, he accepted the satchel from her, walking to the exit of their ruined home after gently tossing it over his shoulder, a forlorn expression across his soft features as he examined the decimated remains of their village and burnt trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma…&quot; He began as she came up beside him, eyes falling downwards. &quot;Are you going to be okay? Without me or Kayda here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t start with that.&quot; She growled, her voice strong, although Kalil realized her face sagged with the weight of the catastrophe which had befallen on the clan as he faced her. &quot;I&#39;m not that old, anyways. And besides,&quot; her head lifted to the sky, &quot;I care about your sister as much as you. I&#39;d honestly go with you if I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil opened his mouth to speak, and then closed it as he could say no more, walking forward only to halt as his grandmother called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get her back for us, Kalil. And make sure to show those demons fresh hell on behalf of all of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay…&quot; Kalil nodded as he spun to face her, before shaking his head and blinking as he steeled himself. &quot;I promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clenching his fists, the blue-haired youth turned back to face the ruined gateway of their village which led to the woods beyond--a once lush forest now little more than a sea of dead burnt trees.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath and without glancing back, Kalil trekked forth… doing his best to prepare himself for whatever would await him in the world beyond as he made his way through the ruined pathways of the forest he had long called home.<br />
<br />
And soon...</p>
