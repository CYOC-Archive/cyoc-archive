<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Francisco peered into the kitchen at Marco, who was flipping pancakes for them.  Francisco hung his head in thought about what he was going to say about last night.  He had used to book to return himself to normal, and Marco had obviously done the same.  He thought about what they had looked like last night, monstrously muscled guys, but with off-season bellies, and both of them with diminished members (Marco chose an erection of 4 inches, while francisco had a 1.)<br />
<br />
  Marco heard a creak, and turned to see Francisco standing there.  &quot;Oh, morning!&quot; he said, cheerfully.  Francisco looked him up and down, noticing that he had played with the book more this morning, the bulge that strained the leg holes of his briefs far enough out to see a huge shaft bending down and between his legs was evidence enough.  &quot;From how you acted last night, I guess you liked being that muscle freak you turned into.&quot;  he said as he placed the pancake onto franciscos plate.  Francisco chuckled a little.  &quot;Actually, yeah, that was fun... but it wasn't what got me going.&quot;.  Marco looked up  &quot;Don't tell me having a 1 incher is what made you so energetic.&quot;.  Francisco shrugged... he was never that big downstairs anyway, and it was kinda cool.  Cool enough to stay that way for a while anyway... he was a soft half inch now, but he wasn't going to tell Marco that.  &quot;Not totally.&quot; Francisco replied. &quot;You know that bit of fat I have on my abs that I've been trying to lose?&quot;  Marco nodded.  &quot;Well, last night, I decided... I don't want to get rid of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Marco dropped the pan into the sink, knowing what Francisco was getting at.  He looked at him, and his enormous bulge began to grow a bit at the thought of what Francisco was about to say.  Francisco piped up.  &quot;I want to try being really... really fat.&quot;.  Marco was interested, never being with a fat guy before.  &quot;Just how 'fat'&quot; do you want to be?&quot; Marco asked.  Francisco turned a bit red.  &quot;Maybe 600... 700 or more?&quot; he chuckled nervously.  Marcos bulge was working it's way out of the briefs and standing tall at 25 inches.  He buckled his knees a bit and had to hold it with both hands to keep it from pointing down.  &quot;I see from the look of that that you want to see it too, right?&quot; Francisco asked.  Marco made a noise of happy agreement, then spoke.  &quot;Well, the boys aren't coming back till 5.  The hernandez' are taking them to the beach.  Why don't we try it right now?:.  Francisco thought a moment, then agreed.  &quot;Then we've got all day to play around.  Let's go&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
  They sat in the living room, looking at the book.  It was in Latin, and it was hard to find anything, since neither of them were close to fluent.  &quot;It's going to take all day to find the right spell.&quot; Marco whined.  &quot;Yeah, I wish this book was in English....&quot; Francisco said as he flipped the pages.  Each page he changed seemed to alter the text.  The two men looked on in amazement as the book turned into English.  &quot;Wow... if only casting the spells was that easy.&quot; Marco said.  Francisco chuckled.  He searched the pages that said &quot;Self&quot; and found a group of body shape spells.  It didn't take long to find a spell that increased body fat, and below it was a spell to reverse it.  It was surprisingly well organized.  &quot;Well, this is it...  I'm gonna make myself fat.&quot; Francisco said, a little warily.  Marco looked on in interest, still holding his huge member.<br />
<br />
  Francisco cleared his throat and spoke.<br />
&quot;A thin man's wish is not profound.<br />
He wants to be heavy and round.<br />
This short spell will do just that.<br />
Ever increasing his body fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
  Francisco placed the book down and waited.  He felt his body begin to tingle, then stop.  He looked down at his flat stomach as it began to push on his white shirt, bowing out slightly.  Marco made a slight sound of intrigue as he watched Francisco slowly gaining weight.  Francisco saw his shirt pilling tight across his midsection, then began to ride up as a golden patch of skin pushed itself out to separate the white shirt from his black boxers.  He turned to Marco, causing his stomach to sway a little.  His boxers were pulling tight across his but and on his thighs, which pulled the crotch open to reveal his shrunken member which was standing full strength at one inch.  Marco looked down in surprise at the choice of keeping it diminished.<br />
<br />
  Francisco was pushing 200 now.  His pudgy stomach was trying to fight gravity, but creased and sagged down over his waistband.  The increasingly large pad of fat on his groin slowly rose up his shaft, enveloping it entirely.  &quot;Wow... It disappeared&quot; Marco said, rubbing himself.  Francisco tried to look down, but was greeted by his own belly instead.  His chest lost it's taut definition, and two man boobs were forming under the tight shirt.  His thighs were stretching the legs of his boxers tightly, causing his thighs to bulge slightly outside the holes. Suddenly, he began to grow quicker.  His stomach sagged further down over his groin as it heaved outward.  Rolls of fat gathered on his sides, and his chest bobbed downward.  A large double chin had formed under his single chin, and his defined biceps were now jiggly tubes.  His t-shirt began to rip, allowing his fat upper body to expand.  His boxers tore straight down the back, allowing them to fall to the floor.  There stood Francisco, a 300 pound man, swelling.<br />
<br />
  He tried to lean down and touch his toes, but his big belly kept him from bending all the way.  Marco stared at him, fixated as his body added pound after pound of fat.  He looked amazing!  He was one of those guys who could pull off being fat.  Francisco giggled a little, causing his entire body to bounce a bit.  &quot;I wonder how fat I am.&quot; he said, grasping his swollen gut as it continued to grow.  He waddled over to the stairs, jiggling with each step, Marco following right behind.  He attempted to run up.  His fat legs colliding with each bound, and his huge belly swaying visibly.  He reached the landing, entirely out of breath, and waddled into the bathroom, swelling up enough to just get stuck in the door.  With a little effort, his body popped through the frame and he waddled onto the scale.  &quot;What does it say, Marco?&quot;<br />
<br />
  Marco looked down at the scale.  &quot;513.&quot;  Francisco cheered a little.  &quot;You obviously can't tell, but I'm so hard right now, it's unbelievable.&quot;  Marco put his hand on the growing belly  &quot;We'll change that later.  If one of us is going to be smaller down there, it might as well be me, so you can have fun with this big body of yours.&quot;  A slow creaking could be heard, then a deafening crack.  Francisco fell forward, landing on Marco.  The two tumbled to the floor, Marco coughed as the wind was knocked out of him.  He looked passed Francisco to the scale, which was shattered.  &quot;You broke the scale!&quot; he shouted.  Francisco chuckled as he pulled himself to his feet.  &quot;I guess I'm fat enough then.&quot;  He shouted &quot;DESINO!&quot; for the spell to stop, but nothing happened.  His huge belly swelled again, nearing his knees.  &quot;Why didn't it stop?&quot;  He asked no one.  Marco looked at him and thought.  &quot;Try saying 'stop'.&quot;.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Stop!&quot; He shouted, and sure enough, it did.  &quot;I guess since the book is in English now, that's what we need to speak in.&quot;  Francisco turned and pushed his stomach through the tiny door, and his hips got stuck.  Marco pushed from behind, and popped his obese boyfriend out onto the landing.  Then helped him into the bedroom to lay down.  Marco went downstairs and got the book, looking at it critically.  What does he do?</p>
