<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes Jackie, Stephanie is fine. They made up. No, you don&#39;t need to come back. Just have fun at college, I&#39;ll see you next weekend. Love you too Jackie, Bye.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Ann hung up her phone she sighed, a small smile spreading across her face. Both Ann and Jackie were worried about their adopted daughter, especially after her argument with her boyfriend. Thankfully, that was in the past. The young couple had ironed out their differences and appeared happy once more.<br />
<br />
With Stephanie happy, Ann now focused on work. While she could work from home, there were still projects she needed to review. Taking a seat at her desk, Ann now powered up her laptop as she began to review several projects that needed her approval. A rumbling in her stomach now made the woman pause. &quot;Probably shouldn&#39;t have skipped breakfast,&quot; she sighed. Making her way towards the kitchen, Ann now began to scan the fridge for someone to eat.<br />
<br />
As she looked over her fridge, she paused as her eyes rested on a pair of apples. Stephanie had returned from a date with Travis recently with a bushel of delicious looking apples. When Ann asked where she had got them from, Stephanie stated from Travis&#39;s family. &quot;They do look good,&quot; she said softly. Not wanting to make a large meal, Ann now grabbed a few of the apples as she made her way back tonher desk.<br />
<br />
As she now began to peruse the projects, Ann began to eat. After one bite, the 46 year old woman&#39;s eyes went wide. Not only was the apple delicious, it energized her more than a cup of coffee. Scanning over the projects, Ann now quickly reviewed them as she continued to eat.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Ann was that these were not ordinary apples, these were Idonn&#39;s apples. For someone like Stephanie the apples revitalized her, giving her energy. For Ann though, they had a much different effect. Ann now found herself unknowingly growing younger.<br />
<br />
The changes at first were subtle, the small lines around Ann&#39;s eyes smoothing, her skin appearing smoother and more vibrant. Finishing the first apple Ann looked closer to 30 than 46. The business womans body fitter, her breasts perkier, with vibrant skin and healthy blonde hair. Still hungry, Ann now grabbed another apple as she continued her work. Unaware of the consequences of eating more than one apple in a sitting. <br />
<br />
The changes now began to quicken as Ann descending into her 20s. Ann&#39;s face appeared softer, her body skinnier as her blonde hair began to grow out slightly. As Ann regressed to her college days she paused as her hair tickled her neck. &quot;Huh,&quot; the now 21 year old Ann said softly. Ann&#39;s normally short hair now brushed her shoulders. &quot;Didn&#39;t realize I needed a haircut.&quot; Shrugging her shoulders, Ann examined herself before smiling. She had always been trim but, as she crept further into her 40s she had begun to notice some flab along her midsection. Since then she had been dieting and working out more. Now seeing a much firmer midsection, she chalked it up to her workout and diet regime. Still, she was a little hungry and if she was going to have a snack it might as well be healthy as she finished her second apple and began eating a third.<br />
<br />
With two Idunn apples and now a third, Ann&#39;s regression was now moving at lightning speed. Two apples were enough to transform her into a teenager, a third apple though would unknowingly land Ann back in single digits. As she retreated through her teens, Ann began to fidget in her seat, her clothes didn&#39;t feel right. Ann&#39;s pants seemed a bit loose around her waist, her bra felt a bit large, even her shoes felt a bit odd. A now 15 year old Ann paused, was she growing younger? <br />
<br />
After so many years around magic, she was used to age changing but it didn&#39;t seem possible. No one with nagic was around and her regression illness had been cured. Still something didn&#39;t feel right. As she finished her apple, she sent off the last of work as she made her way towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Ann grumbled as she felt her pants slide on her waifish hips. Something was definitely going on. Picking up the pace, she could feel her heels pop out of her shoes as she entered the bathroom. Turning towards the mirror she now gasped as she gazed at her appearance.<br />
<br />
Gazing at Ann was a 13 year old version of herself. Ann&#39;s face was round, soft,  her body thin with small breasts engulfed in a shirt and bra made for a woman. Reaching for her hair, Ann was shocked to see it descend past her shoulders, the golden blonde more vibrant than she had seen in years and oddly adorned with flowers. &quot;Crap look at me,&quot; Ann gasped. &quot;I&#39;m younger than Stephanie now!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ann gazed at her youthful appearance, a feeling of dread washed over her. The girls appearance was still changing, Ann&#39;s face continued round, her breasts slowly melting into her chest as her height gradually decreased. The 13 year old girl quickly became a preteen of 12 before leaving puberty completely as she hit her eleventh birthday. &quot;Crap,&quot; she gasped, as she looked at the wide eyed fifth grader.<br />
<br />
Turning from the bathroom, Ann let her far too large pants drop to her ankles as she lept from her too large shoes. A now 10 year old Ann sprinting barefoot down the hall as she grew younger. Somehow she was growing younger and judging from the warm feeling washing over her, it wasn&#39;t stopping. Quickly, she now ran to the kitchen, remembering she had left her phone on the kitchen counter. As she reached the kitchen, she was shocked by her appearance.<br />
<br />
Ann was only 8 years old now, the counters nearly eye level with girl. Ann was probably close to 4 feet tall now and still shrinking. The rapidly regressing girl now having to stand on tip toe as she reached for her phone. Grabbing it before she grew too young, a now 6 year old Ann sent a frantic text for Stephanie to come home.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did your mom want,&quot; Chenoa asked as the two teens parked Stephanie&#39;s car. &quot;No clue,&quot; Stephanie shrugged. &quot;She just texted me and said to come home immediately.&quot; Chenoa nodded, the two friends were about to see a movie when Stephanie received a text from Ann. It wasn&#39;t out of the ordinary for Ann to text but, she never said to come home. As the two teens now unlocked the front door they gasped as they saw Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step a knee I got wittle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie and Chenoa gaped as they gazed at Ann. The young blonde girl couldn&#39;t be more than 3 years old, her shirt acting as a dress, completely engulfing the girl as she gazed up at the teens with wide eyes. &quot;Mom,&quot; Stephanie asked in shock. &quot;How did you turn into a 3 year old?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann shrugged, the tiny blonde preschooler had no answer to her predicament. Feeling embarrassed at her daughter and her friend seeing her like this, her lip began to quiver. &quot;Can you help pwease,&quot; she lisped. <br />
<br />
Stephanie and Chenoa simply looked at one another before looking at Ann. They needed to figure out what to do with Stephanie&#39;s preschool mother.</p>
