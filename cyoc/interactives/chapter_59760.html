<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At 100 miles out, Jeff noticed the change immediately. Nothing had changed physically but Jeff's thinking pattern had changed. He still had the <br />
personality, preferences and behaviors of a dog but he no longer felt okay about it. He looked at himself and wondered, &quot;Why am I naked in a <br />
pet carrier?&quot; He wanted to cover himself. He opened the door on the pet carrier and began rummaging for clothes.<br />
<br />
Jason drove a little further but then pulled over in a relatively secluded spot. There were occasional cars passing by but Jason had found a place <br />
to pull into where they wouldn't be noticed. He came back to the pet carrier where Jeff was. Jeff hadn't found anything yet but embarrassed at <br />
being seen this way by Jason, Jeff pulled his hand back to cover himself. Jason shut the door on the pet carrier.<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;You like being a dog? I've had you in the same sleeping bag with me you pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;But we didn't do anything. I was a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;I know. I remember everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Didn't you enjoy it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason sat down but kept his hand on the pet carrier door keeping it closed with Jeff inside. &quot;It was great having a dog. I'd always wanted a dog <br />
and I found myself wishing that you were my dog. But you're a freak and now I'm one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;What are you going to do with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason didn't say anything. He rummaged through his stuff and found a padlock which he used to lock Jeff in. Then he went back to driving.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Can't I have some clothes?&quot; but Jason didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
Jeff contemplated how he'd spent years nearly naked without thinking anything about it but now felt very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Jason changed direction and wasn't driving to the wilderness anymore. He continued to ignore Jeff and they pulled up at a motel. Jason got out <br />
and opened the pet carrier to let Jeff out. &quot;You're a dog and this motel allows dogs.&quot; Jason attached the leash and led Jeff into the motel. The <br />
motel clerk screamed and made a commotion about how they were trying to run a family motel. She insisted that Jeff couldn't walk around <br />
naked. So they went back to the car and Jason found some clothes for Jeff. Than the motel clerk allowed them to register but she still eyed <br />
them with suspicion and warned them to not disturb any of the other guests with their deviance. Jason told Jeff, &quot;This is your fault. You've got <br />
everyone thinking I'm some kind of deviant.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got into the room and as soon as the door was closed, Jason said, &quot;Strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Why. I'm a human now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Nope, you're still a dog. I know enough about you to know that you still have dog-like thinking. That Chronivac of yours may not <br />
be influencing your thought patterns as much but you're not acting fully human. So strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff realized that Jason was right. Although Jeff no longer felt like it was okay to be naked in public, his dog-like mentality was very <br />
uncomfortable in the clothing and he wanted to be free and Jeff was still on the leash and still felt the effect of his experience in obedience <br />
school. It was best if he obeyed.<br />
<br />
After stripping, Jason slowed down as if unable to make up his mind about what to do next. Jeff said, &quot;We're not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;I know. I have absolutely no sexual desires for you and I know you don't have those desires for me. I remember how good it felt to <br />
sleep next to you and want to feel that good again but no matter how close we got, it was never sexual.&quot; Jason then reached over and held <br />
Jeff's balls. &quot;These are the problem. Even when I thought of you as a dog, I always wished that you didn't have these. When I thought of you as <br />
a dog, I only thought about getting rid of your balls to keep you from sexual entanglements with other dogs but now that you are human, I <br />
want to get rid of your balls so I can sleep with you again and not have to worry about sexual entanglements with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Imagine how I feel. You have balls to. When I thought of myself as a dog, I had specifically set the Chronivac to prevent sexual <br />
entanglements of any kind. But without the influence of the Chronivac, the idea that you have balls gets in the way as I fear a sexual <br />
entanglement as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Well I'm not getting rid of my balls for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;You expect me to get rid of my balls for you? Not going to happen. I don't know what I want my future to be like but I haven't ruled <br />
out the possibility of finding a girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason squeezed Jeff's balls and he doubled over in pain. &quot;I'm going to take you to the doctor and get you neutered as soon as possible. I want <br />
my dog back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;You always were too controlling. That's why I chose to be Mark's dog and not yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason let go and left the room. Jeff got dressed and went for a walk. He walked to a park and found guys playing frisbee and he joined the <br />
game. The guys did think he was strange because he kept acting like a dog but the guys just thought he was being funny. After a while though, <br />
they wandered away complaining that Jeff was taking his dog act too far for comfort.<br />
<br />
Jeff returned to the room and Jason was there. They reconciled their friendship agreeing that they needed to get back under the influence of <br />
the Chronivac as soon as possible. It was late so they spent the night at the motel. They shared the bed naked like they had done many times <br />
before ignoring their human genitalia. They did have erections at night but they ignored those too.<br />
<br />
Waking up in the morning with their friendship intact and strong, they bundled into the car for the return trip. Jeff stripped and got back into <br />
the pet carrier in anticipation of getting back under the influence of the Chronivac. Jason pet Jeff for a while, even massaging his back, and <br />
then drove toward home by the fastest route he could.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, they caught the attention of a cop who pulled them over and proceeded to arrest Jeff for indecent exposure. The cop almost <br />
arrested Jason as well but just gave him a ticket and a summons to appear in court.<br />
<br />
Prison was terrifying to Jeff. Being arrested naked and thrown into jail with a rough crowd, the other prisoners quickly learned the story of how <br />
much of a freak Jeff was. They couldn't do anything immediately because the guards were watching but they were already making whispers of <br />
what they were going to do when the got a chance.<br />
<br />
Later, they got a chance and began closing in on Jeff. Something bad was about to happen. Then suddenly everyone changed their mind. Jeff <br />
felt it too. It was normal again for him to be dog-like. The criminals suddenly perked up and began petting Jeff. They thanked the guards for <br />
allowing a dog into the prison. Jeff stripped out of his prison uniform and they took Jeff out into the prison yard to play fetch.<br />
<br />
The guards were confused about who let the dog in and before long, the guards insisted that the dog be taken out of the prison. But before he <br />
was released, he had visitors. Jeff didn't have a lawyer but he was told that one of the visitors was claiming to be his lawyer. The guard said, <br />
&quot;You can have five more minutes of fetch then we've scrounged up a leash and found your collar. I'll lead you to your visitors then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The visitors did not treat Jeff like a dog but they did not freak out about him. One said, &quot;I'm Larry Tuke from TransDem and this is the <br />
TransDem lawyer but he can be your lawyer if you want him. I've come to make a proposal. We've been monitoring you for years and we have <br />
been pleased with your use of the Chronivac. We've learned a lot. Many of the other people who received Chronivacs quickly got into trouble <br />
and we had to rescue them and some were beyond rescue. It seems that if we allow people to use the Chronivac on others, they quickly turn it <br />
to harmful means and we've had to make modifications to the Chronivac to prevent that. But you only used it on yourself and have improved <br />
your life and the lives of people around you. Therefore we decided to give you an upgrade to your Chronivac. You no longer need to worry <br />
about the 100 mile limit. We've set satellites to broadcast over the whole Earth so that everyone accepts your life. We'd also like to give you a <br />
job as our spokesperson and mascot. You will star in commercials showing how happy you are playing fetch and being everyone's favorite <br />
dog-boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
They talked a while and Jeff asked the question, &quot;Why did the Chronivac predict this as being what I would want? Did the Chronivac think I <br />
wanted to be dominated by others or that I wanted to run around naked and have people touching my body?&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry answered, &quot;From what we can tell, you wanted to trust people. Yes, you have some desire to be touched but our analysis indicates that <br />
you didn't want to be submissive, you didn't want to be exhibitionistic, and your sexual appetite was average for a seventeen year old and <br />
heterosexual in direction. But the Chronivac detected that your greatest desire was to lower your guard, to not have to put on an act, to be <br />
vulnerable but you wanted to be able to trust that no one would take advantage of your vulnerability. The Chronivac, limited in its ability to <br />
innovate, figured this would be the best way to give you what you want. The dog part of you is vulnerable, unguarded, able to just play and <br />
have fun while the human part of you can still exercise some control over your future. Our research department is thinking of better ways to <br />
give you what you want but in the meantime, you've been satisfied as a dog-boy right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;As long as I have an owner like Mark who I trust.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry said, &quot;Alright, we're set to be immune to the Chronivac influence right now so we can conduct business. To us, you're a naked young man <br />
and I have no desire to pet you. If we were not immune to the Chronivac influence, I'd probably pet you and say, &quot;Good boy.&quot;</p>
