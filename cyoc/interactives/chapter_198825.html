<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yo,&quot; Roy got Clyde&#39;s attention after practice. He pulled the other man towards into the showers and pressed him against the wall. Their lips locked. <br />
<br />
But Clyde quickly pushed him away. &quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; he hissed quietly.<br />
<br />
However, Roy was persistent. His hands were running up and down Clyde&#39;s muscular body, feeling his firm arms and shoulders. &quot;C&#39;mon man. I&#39;m so fucking horny after seeing you all day.&quot; Going in for another kiss.<br />
<br />
Clyde tried to fight his own desires as well. &quot;But what about keeping it a secret?&quot; <br />
<br />
Roy&#39;s hands hadn&#39;t stopped. If anything, they were actively trying to take off Clyde&#39;s jersey and pads. &quot;It will be. Everyone&#39;s already gone. It&#39;s just you and me right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot; Clyde tried to think of a defense but knew that Roy had stalled him out on the field long enough for everyone else to get ready to go. Even the coaches had packed up most of their things and headed out. And feeling Roy&#39;s strong hands against his bare abs made it even harder to resist. He&#39;d stopped pushing and started accepting the wild but passionate kisses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Roy complemented as he pushed more of his weight onto Clyde. He pressed Clyde against the ceramic tiled walls, continuing the kiss while undoing the straps of his football pants and releasing his cock. &quot;Now turn around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A-again?&quot; Clyde felt his anus pucker. &quot;You just did it yesterday. I&#39;m still hurtin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon man! Don&#39;t be a fucking loser. I&#39;ve been all horny for you all day,&quot; Roy said. He tried to twist Clyde around but the other man struggled against it. &quot;Dude! What the fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde put on his most intimate gaze. &quot;How about...&quot; slowly he lowered himself down to his knees. His mouth puckered and kissed the tip of Roy&#39;s hard cock. Clyde knew he was making a good decision as Roy&#39;s body shuddered at the light peck. That&#39;s when he stuck his tongue out and licked the tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah... This works...&quot; Roy moaned. His hands were on the cold tile, holding himself up as he felt Clyde&#39;s tongue run up and down his cock. The soft, ticklish sensation rocketed through him, causing his dick to jump with excitement. &quot;So fucking good...&quot; he continued as his fingers curled up against the wall. Feeling Clyde&#39;s mouth engulf his dick and play with it in his mouth was exactly what he wanted. That tongue was perfect. Hitting all the right places. He struggled to not finish. But Clyde was too good. He sent Roy&#39;s rod to the back of his throat, sucking all the while. As he pulled it back out, Roy couldn&#39;t help himself. He blew his load all over Clyde&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell man!?&quot; Clyde jumped back but he&#39;d already gotten a mess all over it. It didn&#39;t help that there were residual blasts that hit his cleats as well. <br />
<br />
Roy just laughed. &quot;Man you&#39;re good. Thanks for that,&quot; gave Clyde a kiss. &quot;But you&#39;d best get that cleaned up before you leave.&quot; He said as he headed for the lockers.<br />
<br />
&quot;But--!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CLYDE?&quot; Zeke called for him. &quot;You still in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde backed up against the shower wall. He was stuck. And with Roy out there, there was no where to go. &quot;Yeah!&quot; he called back. &quot;I was just... Getting a shower,&quot; he instantly thought of and turned it on. &quot;I just felt really gross after practice.&quot; The lie came out hard but Zeke didn&#39;t seem to notice from the echo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... You weren&#39;t answering so I didn&#39;t know if you were going to bail tonight or not. I&#39;ll just text you my address and you can come over when you&#39;re finished,&quot; Zeke said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure man! Will do,&quot; Clyde called back. He hadn&#39;t even thought about the project the two of them were supposed to be doing together. Feeling Roy run his hands over his body was something else. Being starved for any kind of extremely intimate physical contact, made it all the sweeter. He hadn&#39;t even realized that he&#39;d began touching himself. Slowly stroking his dick. &quot;Oh God... Yes... Oh God yes,&quot; he repeated with each stroke, thinking about Roy a bit more. &quot;Oh yeaaaaaahhhh...&quot; his head shot back and a deep satisfied moan ran out of his mouth. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he then groaned as he&#39;d realized what he had done. Luckily the shower would clean it up for him. <br />
<br />
Clyde went to his locker and quickly changed. Then headed for Zeke&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Zeke and Clyde were supposed to be study buddies. Coach Garnet wanted to make sure that all the athletes had someone they could talk to and make sure their grades would stay at least passing. He wasn&#39;t looking for A&#39;s just something to get them through college. And even more Lucky for Clyde, Zeke didn&#39;t have any trouble at all. And even more lucky for him, Zeke was happy to help when Clyde had any problems. He couldn&#39;t believe how lucky Zeke was; smart, handsome and athletic. A real triple threat.<br />
<br />
Clyde pulled up to the address Zeke had sent him and then rang the doorbell. However, he wasn&#39;t expecting what was on the other side of the door. A fairly well built 30 something year old stood there in a sleeveless shirt and some workout shorts. He was a bit sweaty from what looked like a workout, but none the less handsome. &#39;Make that four...&#39; Clyde thought to himself. But what made it a bit weirder was the way he looked down at Clyde. Almost like he already knew him. Zeke and Clyde had mostly been studying at the library, but for some reason, Zeke changed his mind and seemed absolutely adamant about studying at home.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Clyde,&quot; the other man said, holding out his hand. &quot;I&#39;m Mr. Williams. But you can just call me Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... Uhhh... Jake,&quot; Clyde gripped the other man&#39;s hand and shook it. He felt a bit awkward as he stood there. The bit of a left over boner grew in between his legs. If he hadn&#39;t taken care of it prior, he knew it would have been full mast. This guy was hot and seemed to almost know it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zeke! You&#39;re study buddy&#39;s here,&quot; Jake called over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
In another room, he could hear Zeke call back. &quot;I&#39;ll be down in a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll be down in a minute,&quot; Jake repeated. &quot;But come on in. Get comfortable. You want something just ask. Alright? Me casa, su casa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde nodded as he walked in. &quot;Right.&quot; The house was nice. Nothing too massive, but it was clear that Jake had some money. Everything just looked so up to date and clean. And there didn&#39;t seem to be any recent pictures of a woman to do the cleaning. It was just Jake and Zeke on vacation. He eventually settled in on the couch and Jake joined him on the recliner next to it, flipping on the TV to some football.<br />
<br />
&quot;You play with Zeke?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... Yeah! I&#39;m a receiver,&quot; then he paused. &quot;Well... One of the back ups.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to be ashamed of. Doubt many freshmen in college make it to starting lineup,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zeke did...&quot; Clyde mumbled. And his mind went to Roy as well. The big guy was basically just a wall, but that&#39;s all he needed to be. <br />
<br />
Jake flashed an almost knowing smile and wink. &quot;There&#39;s some exceptions,&quot; he said. Then quickly changed the subject. &quot;How&#39;s the love life? Any cute boys your into?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly, every part of Clyde&#39;s body tightened up. A deep seeded anger flashed onto his face. But softened when he realized what he&#39;d just done. &quot;I&#39;m not gay man,&quot; he tries to say calmly but it&#39;s still through gritted teeth. Jake nods politely. However, that knowing smile seemed all the more frustrating. &quot;I&#39;m not.&quot; Clyde repeated.<br />
<br />
However, Zeke&#39;s voice cut through the tension. Clyde felt his body jump as he heard him ask, &quot;Ready to go over some homework?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Yeah!&quot; Clyde turned around on the couch and then got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll order you two some pizza,&quot; Jake said as he pulled out his phone. Though the amount of typing he was doing looked like he was doing more than just putting in a phone.<br />
<br />
Clyde and Zeke headed to the dining room and pulled out their homework for the week. Zeke had always been so diligent with his work that Clyde felt like he needed to match the other man&#39;s pace. However, he couldn&#39;t help but get at least a little bit bored. And want to talk. &quot;Hey,&quot; he stated, not sure how to properly start the conversation. &quot;I, uhhhh... Have this friend. She&#39;s uhhh... having a bit of trouble with a guy she likes and I wasn&#39;t sure what to tell her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Zeke didn&#39;t even look up from his notes as he continued writing something down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Yeah,&quot; Clyde still felt uncomfortable about the obvious lie. &quot;It&#39;s that she likes him but she feels like he&#39;s only using her for sex but she wanted more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell her to dump him,&quot; Zeke said without much thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot; answer caught Clyde off guard. It was so straight forward and honest. Moreover, it was probably the right thing to do. &quot;But, uhh... what if she really likes him and still wants to be with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then she probably has to talk to him about it. Make him know what&#39;s bothering her and then try to take a bit of charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, the answer was obvious, but Clyde didn&#39;t want it to be true. &quot;But what if he doesn&#39;t listen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeke thumped his pencil onto the notepad. Then looked Clyde in the eyes. &quot;Then she should refer to my first answer, dump him.&quot; However, seeing Clyde&#39;s sullen look, a heavy breath of air pushed out of his nose. &quot;Look. If it&#39;s that important to her she either needs to talk to him or move on. More fish in the sea or whatever. That&#39;s what Christie did. Said the only move Roy ever knew was the fucking jack hammer.&quot; Clyde accidently let out a laugh knowing it was pretty true. &quot;Piece of shit wasn&#39;t good at much of anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, Clyde couldn&#39;t let that statement stand. &quot;He&#39;s not that bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeke rolled his eyes. &quot;Sure he isn&#39;t. Just a big ole softie with a heart of gold. That&#39;s why he picks on guys smaller than him and flirts with any woman in his eyesight. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right,&quot; Clyde struggled to agree. &quot;But he&#39;s been doing better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please,&quot; Zeke shook his head. &quot;Coach has been ignoring all the shit since he&#39;s so big, but if he keeps pulling the stunt he did today, there&#39;s no way he&#39;s going to stay on the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was just distracted. That&#39;s all,&quot; Clyde shot back. But he couldn&#39;t deny that Roy did look a bit different than usual. He was letting more guys past him than normal. Each guy who made it past looked to be just barely out of grasp, like Roy&#39;s fingers just couldn&#39;t barely touch them. But close doesn&#39;t matter if the other team darts around you. Then there was just how horny he was in the shower. His cock was throbbing just at Clyde&#39;s touch. Not to mention how much quicker on the draw he was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because he&#39;s thinking about that girl you were talking about,&quot; Zeke glared.<br />
<br />
A shutter rushed through Clyde&#39;s body. He instantly shut up at the thought that Zeke might have just called him out. Luckily Jake walked in with several large pizzas and then to the kitchen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come and grab some. Didn&#39;t know what you liked so I got a big selection,&quot; Jake said.</p>
