<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Someone had desecrated Greg’s room.<br />
<br />
It stunk like sex, his bedsheets were crumpled as of people had been fucking atop them, and there was just a feeling in the air as if something sinful had occurred. This was what he got for rooming with three guys who were filled to the brim with sin and lust. Premarital sex, masturbation, lust. Why couldn’t he have roomed with a bunch of guys who just wanted to go to bible study and attend church on Sundays.<br />
<br />
That was where he’d come back from, a couple hours of spiritual cleansing and holiness. He’d sung hymns, apologized for his sin, and been given forgiveness. Then he came back to his room and someone had defiled it. He had a rage inside him like no other, slamming his door shut and kneeling before his bed.<br />
<br />
“Forgive me Heavenly Father for not protecting my sacred space,” he prayed, his face so close to the bed he could smell it, the scent of sex and sinful juices. It was so wrong, it was so sinful, it was so hot.<br />
<br />
He was a good boy, always had been, but the second that scent went up his nose his dick went erect and his heart started to pound as if he was excited. No, he was turned on by the desecration, this was bad. His soul was in danger of being corrupted by his weak fleshy body.<br />
<br />
“No, I can’t be weak,” Greg trembled while kneeling at the edge of that bed. “I will not be controlled by sin. I will not be corrupted by sin. I will not perform sin...”<br />
<br />
As those words left his mouth he realized he already was. His hands were down near his pants rubbing his penis through the fabric. A gasp escaped his mouth as the pleasure of wrongfulness swelled inside him. He began to pant and shake, trying his best to hold onto his virtues and morals. But virtues and morals didn’t feel that good.<br />
<br />
His eyes snapped open, his tongue hung out, and he began to pant while feverishly stroking his member. It was all bliss for about two minutes before something happened that made him gasp and freeze.<br />
<br />
His dick lurched and suddenly sucked back into his body, as if it was angry he dared touch it in a sinful light. He stumbled to his feet and stared down in panic as his body began to change. First his vision of his crotch was cut off by breasts erupting from his chest, bouncing around and shaking all his chest hair loose, then his waist squeezed in painfully and nearly made him lose balance. His hips cracked outwards painfully, his thighs inflated in size with a pull on his skin, and his bones popped and cracked as they shrunk and resized themselves. Every change was painful and he cried out in agony as the burning filled his body. Shoulders creaking inwards, jawline shrinking and breaking, hair being ripped from his scalp by hands like hot lead. His nails slid out in agony, his skin burned as his body hair singed off, and his eyes hurt like they had sand in them. His nose broke and reshaped itself, his Adam’s apple choked him as it shrunk, and his clothes slipped off his body, now too large. His scalp hurt from his now long hair growing and he panted, covered in sweat and sore all over. That brief moment of pleasure rewarded with harsh burning pain.<br />
<br />
He or rather she began to cry, tears falling from her face in sobs. One moment of weakness and she’d been punished with the sinful body of a woman. Why had she let his body get the better of him? Why couldn’t she have avoided the lust? Now all her feelings about girls were sinful and gay.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I won’t let it happen again,” she cried. “Please turn me back, I won’t be filled with weakness again!”<br />
<br />
No response came so she fell to her knees in tears, all that burning pain for one moment of weakness? It was unfair! She shouldn’t be a woman, she should be forgiven.<br />
<br />
All she felt was guilt and a bubbling emotion filled her. Years of her life devoted to being free of sin, for what? That two minutes of pleasure was better than any other moment of her life. She glared at nothing, letting the scent of sex full her nose and make her feel oh so horny.<br />
<br />
She stuck her fingers in her new vagina and the hot feeling of pleasure returned. She ran her tongue over her lips and thrusts her new breasts forward while pumping and out of her body. New thoughts emerged as she smiled in glee.<br />
<br />
“I want to be controlled by lust,” she moaned as her body started to burn again, except this time that burning was pleasurable. “I want to sin! Oh let me be corrupted! Corrupt me! Corrupt me!”<br />
<br />
As she pumped her breasts began to expand getting bigger and sluttier. Her hips grew bigger, her waist got smaller, and best of all the skin on her forehead started to hurt. Nubs pushed against it before breaking the skin with a bloody snap. Black horns began to rise from her forehead, twin spires of darkness that seemed to make the room dimmer. Her hair turned a stark white, the colour of bleached bones, and her eyes went from blue to purple and then faded into red. Her skin got paler as if she hadn’t seen sunlight in her life and her tailbone shot out of her skin, growing into a long spindly tail ending in a sharp point. Her nails turned as black as midnight, her canines extended into sharp fangs, and lastly two tiny little wings sprouted from her back.<br />
<br />
She shuddered in place, fire exploding from her body and burning her clothing to cinders and charring her bedroom. She continued to masturbate on the floor as stockings appeared on her feet, heels soon to follow, and a lacy black set of lingerie formed on her body, showing off her belly button. As the panties formed her fingers went from thrusting to rubbing and once they were out her other clothing formed. A very short black skirt, a bright red button down shirt that left everything to the imagination, a black tie, and a bone white suit jacket. Glasses perched on her new sexy face and she stood up, in the afterglow of a nice session of masturbation.<br />
<br />
“That’s better,” she mused while clenching her hands together before feeling up every curve on her body with a smile. “Mmmm... I can’t wait for someone to unwrap this little present.”<br />
<br />
Her room started to shift, her decor becoming classy and organized, she had schedules to keep and wanted her space neat and organized whenever she had a mortal over. It made the messes she and whatever hot piece of sin she brought over all the more titillating. She was wet just thinking about messy bedsheets and piles of books knocked to the floor.<br />
<br />
“And to think I avoided this,” the new demon girl mused. Greg didn’t seem like an appropriate name now. She liked the sound of Georgia, yeah, that worked much better than her old moniker. Mmm she couldn’t wait to get a mortal in her pants and make him or her do whatever she pleased. She liked bossing people around like that, it made her nether regions damp and her legs start rubbing together in anticipation.</p>
