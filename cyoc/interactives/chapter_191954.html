<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As madame Illusia finished presenting the  contraption many people in the audience were looking at with a slight interest, however nobody had the courage to come on stage and experience this process.<br />
Fortunately madame Illusia saw a man who was looking at his hands in the first row rotating them from side to side and inspecting them.<br />
You, in the first row, would you like me to give you something to inspect about your hands? <br />
Me?, asked the confused participant... <br />
Yes you! you seem to be interested about your hands quite a lot...<br />
Yeah,well I have always wondered how my hands and legs would look like while being elongated and reshaped to have hooves at the end of them. There is just something so interesting about visualizing how your hands can lengthen to reach the same height as your legs. <br />
Well say no more! Why don&#39;t we grant you this peculiar wish of yours and reshape your body to wander this earth on four 4 legs. Making it ideal for hauling  cargo,humans and for long distance travel. In order for you to gain these advantages we need to make a compromise and that is to encase your hands and feet in keratin to create your new and improved system of locomotion. I seriously doubt that you will feel a need for your hands after a few days of living without them. <br />
Sure, miss, I might as well make my desire of living with hooves and on all fours a reality. Show me what it is like to limit myself to strictly what hooves can do. <br />
Come on up young man and I&#39;ll give you something which not even I can undo. This is a liquid, that transcends our dimension and alters the fabric of our reality itself by acting as a means for an alternate reality to seep in to our own. In our case, one in which your soul was born as a draft animal. <br />
As the boy came up on the stage madame Illusia strapped his hands in to a contraption that would keep only a specific part of his hand inside the mold,that being his four fingers, his knuckles eventually turning into the fetlock of that leg. His legs were strapped down in the same fashion and he was getting excited. <br />
Madame Illusia started the wood fire below the cauldron and waited about 15 minutes to heat up in which she checked if the device is set up right and his limbs can&#39;t move. At some point she checked the temperature of the liquid which had already melted and saw that it was 45°C.<br />
Ah we&#39;re ready to begin the process. <br />
Assistant release the cauldron! <br />
As she said that one of her farm hands released the breake of the couldron and the glistening black liquid started flowing  in to the auxiliary pan which would redirect it into the four moulds for his hands and feet. <br />
As he was looking at the black liquid flowing first towards his hands he spread out his fingers to help the liquid attach to them. The liquid started filling the moulds of his hands and he remarked through his pain that it was like getting burned by very hot water however after the initial sensation subsided his hands became numb. Unbeknownst to him his fingers were fusing together creating the inside of his hooves and the liquid acting as filler for his hooves. Due to the reality alteration properties after fusing was done it was undestinguishable from the hoof of an animal. <br />
The hot liquid eventually reached his feet as well and it was the same burning sensation as the first time however it also subsided ending in his feet becoming numb. As with the first set of hooves they started fusing together to create the flesh inside of his back hooves with the filler liquid acting as the reality altering liquid that was replaced with keratin once it fused with his legs creating another pair of shiny hooves. <br />
His fetlock for his legs started to form raising what were once his knuckles off the hoof mold. His heels subsequently started to lengthen and form his cannons. His thighs started bulking up with muscle to help transport this new body. <br />
His hands followed suit the metamorphosis climbing from the hoof molds upwards. His fetlock was formed and raised off the mold  creating a basis for his palm to start elongating by a huge amount into his cannons, the bones in his hands fusing into one solid bone that was to support his weight. <br />
His lower and upper hand started bulking up with muscle and to lengthen fusing his lower arm into a solid bone as well. His shoulder blades moving under him to support himself better on four legs. <br />
His chest ballooned a bit to support his new shoulder blades but not that much that it wasn&#39;t recognizable as a human&#39;s torso. His basin did changes quite a lot on the other side widening a considerable amount to accommodate his new joints and the brand new spine that he was about to receive. As that happened his tail started to sprout from his back slithering it&#39;s way out. <br />
As he was looking at his new front legs that ended in the hoof moulds which surely housed his very own hooves as he had been looking at his hands previously(quite a change in scenery) he noticed grey fur sprouting from his front hooves upwards. His thoughts raced through his mind was he turning into a donkey or a horse, this prompted him to look in distress at madame Illusia who was laughing. <br />
The machine at this point let him go, the liquid having altered reality in such a way for his body that, that would have been his body if he would have been born an animal. At this point his front and back legs were indistinguishable from those of an animal, he also had a tail and a partially completed torso. <br />
His legs were covered in grey fur while his torso was only partially covered. <br />
He released his front left hoof from the mold followed closely by the right one. <br />
He pulled out 2 perfect black hooves which he set near the mold to inspect. <br />
He was mesmorised by them and he couldn&#39;t stop admiring what his hands had turned into. <br />
He also dislodged his back legs with an equally perfect set of mat black hooves coming out of those molds as well. <br />
He started strolling around the stage on his new hooves making the familiar clip clip sound. <br />
At this point his unchanged head reached madame Illusia shoulder. <br />
Now the question is. She said while speaking to the audience and him as well. <br />
What do I turn you into a Jackass or a Grey horse?<br />
Which animal do you think those hooves belong to? she said while pointing at the audience. <br />
The audience started cheering while he was still looking at his hooves which he now possessed for the rest of his life. His form was arguably changing to that of a born animal and he was somewhat satisfied by that. <br />
While these thoughts raced through his head the audience started telling madame Illusia through the chattering. <br />
Make him a Grey horse!<br />
No,give him some long Grey ears to go with his now long legs! <br />
OK I&#39;m selling him anyway, whoever buys him can decide what he will become and subsequently what animal those hooves belong to. </p>
