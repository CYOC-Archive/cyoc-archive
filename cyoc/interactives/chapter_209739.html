<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark waited a few moments before he approached Justin on the ground in front of the tv, stuffing his face with everything in front of him.<br />
“Hey Justin, are you okay?” Mark asked to get his attention.<br />
Justin had just swallowed a few crumbs he had left on the carpet before, turned towards Mark. “Yeah, I´m alright “oink”. What do “Oink oink” you want?” By now, Justin was oinking every few words, so long as food was in range. And as Justin would eat nearly everything, that meant most of the time.<br />
Mark grinned down at him, putting Justin´s shoes next to him. “Not much. Do you know what to do with them?” Like Rick, Justin looked a bit confused at the shoes. And just as Mark had done with Rick before, he clapped as soon as Justin opened his mouth to say “no”.<br />
“You see Justin, these shoes you need to put onto your feet, while these” Mark pulled the second pair of Chris´s dirty socks out of Justin´s shoes, “you need to pull onto your hands. I know you normally don´t put something onto either your hands or feet, but trust me, you won´t even notice you wear them afterwards. You will only notice the smell and taste, something stinking, but can´t get rid of it.” Mark explained what he wanted from Justin.<br />
Justin shook his head, then nodded at Mark. With some difficulty, he slipped his feet into his shoes, forgoing to even try to lace them up. The socks went onto his hands a bit easier, and with everything in place Justin´s face relaxed again, his earlier needed concentration to put the items on forgotten, much like the items themselves.<br />
As Mark watched, the grey socks on Justin´s hands shrunk back onto his fingers, with no indication that there was more than two underneath each. The cloth hardened, reducing Justin´s hands to real looking hooves fitting a pig. His white tennis shoes shrunk in a similar way, forming two “toes” while turning the same dark grey the socks had already been. They, too, hardened into a pair of hooves, effectively robbed of any flexibility. Justin wouldn´t use them that way anymore.<br />
Mark could also see something small pushing up Justin´s pants just above his ass a bit, and with a slight discomfort that resulted in, made Justin squirm on the floor. Grinning, Mark asked after a few seconds: “Is there a problem that you are squirming, Justin?”<br />
Justin grunted out: “It feels like “oink” something is in m...”<br />
Mark stomped before saying: “Then why have you even put these pants on, Justin? For fun? Isn´t it far more constricting to you then you like? Do yourself a favor and rip it apart, free your ass and tail from that restriction and tightness. After all, you never wore anything beside a shirt, right? Not even underwear, not that you wear any right now, do you?”<br />
Justin looked even more uncomfortable now and promptly tried to destroy his pants with his hooves. It took some effort as the pants were robust, but eventually, they teared away and Justin sigh in relief. He was now naked from the waist down, at least to himself, only wearing his stained, light red shirt. The other things he wore, namely the shoes and socks turned hooves and his underwear were forgotten by him, feeling like being his actual body.<br />
Mark grinned at Justin´s new extension, a short, swirled pink pig tail above his ass, slowly swinging behind him unnoticed. Like Rick, Justin´s underwear had become a part of him, and the tail had grown from it. His asshole was beneath it, a small hole in the underwear. Also like with Rick was the fact that he was nulled by his former underwear, as his cock and balls were hidden and untouchable. He would pee out his ass now, and never experience cumming, at least as long as Mark let him be his pig. Mark knew Justin´s underwear had been white before, but now it was a dark pink, a fitting color for his little piggy Justin.<br />
Seeing Justin relax again, Mark grinned before lightly slapping him on his ass right next to his tail. Justin squealed loudly before looking back at Mark in a bit of anger. “What?” he asked, oinking afterwards a few times.<br />
“Aren´t you hungry? Come on, eat up that pants shreds around you. And in your next game break, you can eat up all the dirty socks and clothes in Chris´s room. He just left them on the floor for you. Sounds good?” Mark asked with another evil grin.<br />
Justin didn´t answer verbally, but turned and devoured the shreds of his pants around him. And he couldn´t wait for the next break, maybe he had enough time now?<br />
It was just then that the game ended, and Chris had to switch with Justin, giving over the controller to his friend. Mark could see the disappointment in Justin´s eyes, knowing he had to wait for his treat some more time. The controller dropped from Justin´s hooves the moment Chris let it go, as Justin wasn´t able to hold it. He slowly placed it in front of himself by pushing it with his hooves instead.<br />
<br />
When the game finally started and everyone but Chris was concentrating on it, Mark approached his brother. Chris looked up to him on his own, surprised Mark had watched their game and waited, not realizing or noticing what he had done while “waiting”. As Mark gave Chris his shoes, he lifted an eyebrow in confusion. “Why do you bring me my shoes and” Chris took in a whiff, looking disgusted, “a pair of my dirty socks?”<br />
Mark smiled. “The socks are for you to remember doing your laundry, but that won´t be a problem any longer. For what could I bring you your shoes Chris, what do you think?”<br />
Chris looked only a bit apologetic about the laundry. “Sorry, I will collect my laundry soon. Do you want me to put…”<br />
Mark clapped before Chris could complete his sentence. While he really wanted for Chris to put on the shoes, that alone wouldn´t work. So, instead, Mark explained: “First, you need to strip that socks you are wearing off. Throw them over to Justin, he will dispose of them in his own way. Then, you will pull your shoes onto your bare feet, that you got right. Afterwards, pull the dirty socks that now are inside the shoes onto your hands. Don´t worry, they won´t restrict you in any way. In fact, you won´t even notice them anymore afterwards beside the smell and taste, but you can´t do anything about it.”<br />
Chris nodded in acceptance of his brother’s command. He quickly discarded of his worn socks by throwing them at Justin. They fell short near Justin´s feet, and without looking, Justin squealed happily. Chris feet vanished inside his grey shoes next, but he made no move to close them, as he couldn´t tie them with his fists. With a disgusted face he pulled the dirty, dark blue socks onto his hands with a bit of difficulty. That look increased, when Chris couldn´t pull the socks up any other way then tugging them with his teeth, so he tasted them even more.<br />
With the socks in place, Chris relaxed, but was still disgusted by the taste inside his mouth. The shoes and socks were forgotten. Chris´s shoes were slowly deforming from their rounded end into separate endings, forming claws on their tips. Out of the sole grew paw-pads, while the overall form forcing Chris to walk on the front of the newly formed paws, heels up in the air.<br />
The socks shrunk onto Chris knuckles, from with them grew out another set of claws. Around the underside, where beneath the socks had been his nails, grew the paw-pads for his front-paws. His wrists stiffened, making turning them around impossible for Chris. He could only bend his whole arm from the elbows or shoulders now. Both sets of paws turned dark brown, leaving no trace of the grey shoes or the dark blue socks behind.<br />
Chris shorts were pushed down by a burst of dark brown fur, as from his black boxers grew out his new, long tail. Mark could see the boxers turning brown as well, to the same conditions as Justin´s and Rick´s had, meaning that, beneath the tail, a hole formed, his brother´s new asshole. Even without seeing it, Mark knew his brother´s cock and balls were restricted like he wished they were. As Chris was laying on his side, the tail didn´t bother him, but his slid-down shorts were uncomfortable to him now.<br />
Mark watched Chris fidget for a minute or two, the shorts not really moving anywhere, before he asked: “Why are you fidgeting so much, Chris? Something in your shorts?”<br />
Chris turned towards his brother, answering: “It´s the shorts itself. Somehow, they just sit wrong. Maybe I should just get…”<br />
Mark stomped at that. Like before, Chris would have done what Mark wanted, but only part of it. Therefore, he stopped Chris, adding what he wanted him to do exactly.<br />
“Yes, get them off, tore them up if that’s faster. I don´t know why you even tried them on. It doesn´t fit with your tail after all. You wear only a shirt normally, right? No need for shoes, socks, pants or underwear, right? Beside that shirt, you are naked, like always.”<br />
Chris nodded as he tore off his shorts, adding more shreds for Justin to the floor. With a relaxed sigh, he stopped fidgeting. “Yeah, don´t know why I tried that. It was dumb of me.”<br />
“Like always, little brother” Mark teased him laughing, making Chris growl at him a bit. Just then, the game round was over, and Theo, sitting on the couch behind Chris, gave his controller over to him. He was next to sit out, after all. Chris, like Justin, dropped the controller when Theo let go of it, and it bounced from his stomach down to the ground, from where Chris slowly arranged it before his paws to play.</p>
