<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess picked up the vial she had been fingering and slipped it into her hand.  She frowned, looking at her hand, lost in thought.  Sitting on the edge of her bed, Mary folded and refolded her arms and frowned as well.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you pick, Jess?&quot; Mary asked, attempting to conceal her impatience.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha?&quot;  Jess turned to Mary, her reverie broken.  Jess's felt warmth in her cheeks.  &quot;I'm sorry, I was just thinking.  I'm still not sure about this, Mary.  I mean, how can magic really exist?  You're not putting me on, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary sat bolt upright.  &quot;No!  This is for real!  I did it myself.&quot;  She paused.  &quot;And I loved it.  I just wanted to share this with you.  That's all.  I thought you'd appreciate this kind of different experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
The warmth in Jess's cheeks quickly turned up a notch.  She didn't need a magic vial to turn her into a beet red girl, she could do that on her own.  Well, Jess thought, I did some pretty edgy stuff back in college.  This isn't any different, right?  With a shrug, Jess uncorked the vial and drank all the sweet liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess!&quot;  Mary stood up and tried to reach her friend in time.  Jess put the stopper back in the vial and replaced it in the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean for you to drink all of it!  That's going to change you completely!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?  You said you enjoyed it, so I'm guessing that all the vial will be even better, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary sighed and flopped down on her bed again, giving Jess a pained look.  &quot;I hope you're right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess's stomach growled and she pressed her hands to it.  She looked like she might be sick.  &quot;I don't feel so good.&quot;  Mary could only watch as her friend began her transformation, into what, she did not know.<br />
<br />
The first thing Jess noticed was that her clothes were tighter.  Her once loose t-shirt was now becoming increasingly stretched by her chest.  She cried out in pain as her body strained inside the too small shirt.  Not only was she growing wider, but also taller.  Jess's shirt could no longer cover her belly.  Watching in amazed horror, Jess's shirt ripped to shreds.  <br />
<br />
Jess pressed her hands over her larger upper body.  She brushed a hand over a now barrel like chest and brought her hand to her breast.  She moaned as she caressed the soft flesh that was pulled taut over her.  As she kept rubbing her breast, it slowly shrank into her chest even as she grew larger.  <br />
<br />
The feeling of constraint grew again, this time with her pants.  Two hands shot to her thighs as they swelled inside tight denim.  The jeans resisted spectacularly and kept Jess well inside.  She yelled out and fell to her knees.  The tightness became almost unbearable.  First one tear appeared, then another.  With the sound of ripping fabric, Jess's growing thighs and legs fought free of the jeans.  Jess let out a sigh as they finally gave way, tearing off and falling to shreds to the floor.  <br />
<br />
Jess panted and looked at her body.  She was huge, a good eight feet tall, if she stood up.  Jess clutched a hand to her belly and held herself up with the other one.  Without the restraining clothing, Jess was free from the pain of her growth, which wasn't done yet.  Jess could feel the flesh under her hand increasing and swelling.  Like when you put your hand on a balloon and then inflated it.  You could feel the balloon grow under your hand.  It was the same feeling Jess had.  She was gaining weight and girth by the second.  <br />
<br />
A wave of dizziness swept over Jess forcing her to put both hands on the floor to steady herself.  Her vision cleared and she watched as her view of the room changed.  It took a moment for her to realize that her arms were growing.  They lengthened and slimmed.  She stared down at her arms and knew them to be changing into legs.  Her hands felt and looked to melt into a single, solid darkening mass.  The same feeling as her arms spread to her legs.  Her hide legs.<br />
<br />
She was becoming what she'd always yearned to experience.  It was true, these vials were magic.  And they were making her wish come true.  A tear ran down Jess's face.  It trickled down her cheek, and kept going down her cheek.  Jess's face pushed outward into a muzzle, carrying the tear along for the ride.  A huge smile crept over Jess's lips even as they turned rubbery and large.  <br />
<br />
A tickling sensation on the back of her legs made her want to scratch.  She tried to lift a leg to do just that, but found it would only move up and down and not to the side.  A giggle escaped her as Jess moved her tail for the first time.  <br />
<br />
Her playful tail flicking was cut short when her neck pushed her already long face out even further.  Jess's once long and blond hair swept down her new long and thick neck and became a gorgeous mane.  <br />
<br />
Jess didn't know how long her transformation took.  She didn't care.  It had been wonderful.  The vial had worked.  She turned cautiously to find and face Mary.  It was harder than she thought, everything was so cramped.  She hadn't realized that she'd be so big.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well.  You do make quite the pretty mare, Jess.  Certainly not a bad choice.&quot;  Mary moved to pat Jess on the rump, which Mary was eye level with.  Jess turned her head and neighed happily at Mary, who returned the gesture by rubbing her friend's changed face.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you've made your choice.  Shall I make mine?&quot;  Mary asked and turned to the box of vials.</p>
