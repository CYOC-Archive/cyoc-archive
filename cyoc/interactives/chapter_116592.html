<br />
&quot;DANG! It&#39;s a tie!&quot; exclaimed Eric Anderson, as the white furred werepanther watched his girlfriends eat each other to a mutual orgasm.<br />
&quot;Not that I don&#39;t mind a photo finish, so to speak,&quot; said werepanthress Frieda Knight, while happily licking her muzzle of the tasty cream from her girlfriend, &quot;but what do we do now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. I need Eric&#39;s good hard cock in me as soon as possible too,&quot; commented Spencer Lawson, the black furred werewolf/panther/cat hybrid that completed this unique trio.<br />
&quot;And I certainly want both of you, as often as possible,&quot; said Eric, as the three of them watched his panther penis twitch in anticipation of being buried in a hot vagina. &quot;Say, what if I try titty-fucking both of you at the same time?&quot; he asked, while kneeling on the ground next to his ladies.<br />
&quot;Think you&#39;re man enough to take on four hot breasts at once panther boy?&quot; teased Spencer, as both girls started crawling toward him.<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; said Eric, grabbing his cock while smiling at them.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Oh Douglas,&quot; cooed Joan Morning Cloud, cuddling her fiance. &quot;I feel SO much better now,&quot; added the weretigress, as she snuggled closer to her man. She was no longer suffering withdrawal effects from the delayed consummation of their were-wedding.<br />
&quot;You certainly do,&quot; replied Sheriff Douglas Cooper, as the werebear held his future bride closer. &quot;Now then beautiful, what do you think of having our formal wedding next Valentines&#39; Day?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;You hopeless romantic you,&quot; <i>purred*</i> the weretigress. &quot;But why wait? Except for you and Darrell, I know absolutely no one here in Moon Lake, so depending upon who you want to invite, we could go before a justice of the peace at any time. The only crimp in that plan would be Darrell starting first grade tomorrow, which would affect any honeymoon plans we make.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, although we&#39;re already married as far as were nature is concerned, I definitely want to wait until AFTER the Feds pick up Frederick Parker and the rest of his men to make it legal,&quot; said Douglas, as he started caressing her warm form softly with his paws. &quot;But you shouldn&#39;t be such a shut in all the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m complaining about it, but taking care of you and Darrell is pretty much a full time job as it is,&quot; observed Joan.<br />
&quot;Well, I have been thinking about that,&quot; said Douglas, recalling his previous prophecy dreams concerning them and their future. &quot;You know all those bedtime stories you tell Darrell, along with those pictures you make to accompany them? What about trying to get those published?&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; said Joan, looking at him in disbelief. &quot;I just do that to entertain our son,&quot; she added, not realizing what she just actually said, considering Darrell Cooper was technically just Douglas&#39; cousin. &quot;I never thought. Besides... Alyssa always wanted me to stay home and keep a low profile,&quot; revealed Joan, mentioning Darrell&#39;s biological mother and her fiance&#39;s deceased cousin.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s going to be plenty of changes around here, and all of them positive,&quot; began Douglas, turning to face her better. &quot;Besides us getting married, I plan to start remodeling this old place. Besides a decent kitchen and maybe expanding this room into a more decent master bedroom for two, Darrell needs his own room instead of just camping out in what was my den. I can add a room for your work in the process,&quot; he offered.<br />
&quot;And a bedroom and extra bathroom for each new cub we bring into the world too?&quot; asked Joan, while reaching down with her paws to caress his furry shaft.<br />
&quot;Whenever that happens,&quot; said Douglas, as he began to passionately kiss his fiance.<br />
But before they could get intimate again, there was a knock on the outer bedroom door.<br />
&quot;Uncle Yogi?&quot; called out Darrell, &quot;there&#39;s someone at the door.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not expecting anyone,&quot; said the Sheriff as he defurred. Then he threw on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt before getting his gun out of its safe.<br />
Cautiously walking to the front door after telling Darrell to stay in the hallway and keep an eye on &quot;Mama Furry&quot; (Joan), he called out &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />
The only things he saw outside were one lone man and a delivery van.<br />
&quot;Catering delivery from The Local Diner,&quot; replied the man on the other side of the door.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t order anything,&quot; said Douglas in return.<br />
&quot;I know sir. Leon Talbot did. Paid in advance. I have dinner for 3 with his compliments to be delivered to this address after 4 today.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, how about that,&quot; Douglas said with a smile on his human face, as he put the safety back on his gun before sticking it in the back of his shorts&#39; waistband.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Not knowing that his prearranged gesture of thanks had been delivered on time, Leon Talbot sat in the Emergency waiting room of Moon Lake General Hospital with his family, along with their children&#39;s fiances, as his son Peter was being checked out again after discovering blood in his urine.**<br />
How long everyone waited, no one knew for sure.<br />
The tension wasn&#39;t quite as great as when Peter had been shot last Friday night by a mobster&#39;s son passing through town just because he wanted Peter&#39;s restored 1966 Ford Mustang, but it was definitely something no one should have experienced twice, let alone in such a short amount of time.<br />
Then, everyone looked up as Doctor Tora Tachibana cleared his throat.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got good news and bad news,&quot; began Doctor Tachibana, shocked that he was able to catch so many weretigers and a werewolf by surprise. <i>They must really be worried about Peter,</i> realized the werefox despite the fact everyone present was in their human forms.<br />
&quot;Well?&quot; asked both Peter&#39;s parents and his fiance, Doctor Helen Thompkins, almost in unison.<br />
&quot;First and foremost, Peter&#39;s stitches and the internal stapling of his wounds are all intact,&quot; began Tachibana.<br />
&quot;What a relief!&quot; sighed Helen.<br />
&quot;All that material is bio-degradable and will dissolve naturally in Peter&#39;s system as he heals. Now then, after getting the results of the blood tests, x-rays, and MRI scan; Peter did pass a foreign object through his urinary tract, like Doctor Thompkins theorized. However, what the item was was a very minute bone fragment. Probably from a rib that was cracked when Peter was shot,&quot; revealed Tachibana.<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; inquired Leon, before Helen could question Tachibana further.<br />
&quot;From what I&#39;ve been told, if it wasn&#39;t for all the... rutting your son and his fiance have done lately to celebrate their were-wedding, the problem probably wouldn&#39;t have raised its ugly head for another week or two at the latest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is that the rest of the good news or the bad news?&quot; Peter&#39;s mother Regina Talbot wanted to know.<br />
&quot;The good,&quot; answered Tachibana. &quot;The bad is that we discovered there is still one more minute fragment trying to make the journey out of Peter&#39;s system. Like its predecessor, it will successfully complete the exit journey in time, but considering everything your son has already been through, we&#39;re going to keep him here overnight for observation and see if we can speed up the process as painlessly as possible. However, regardless of when he does pass the last fragment, Peter will need to not have any sex from now until at least 48 hours after he successfully passes it,&quot; advised the doctor.<br />
Jean Talbot couldn&#39;t help but smile at the news. <i>Something new to tease Peter about,</i> she thought happily, not noticing the stern look Leon, Regina, and Helen were all giving her at that moment.<br />
