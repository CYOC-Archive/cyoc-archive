<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The shifting between masculine and feminine pronouns is deliberate.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shari Benson had been skeptical at first, but not for the reasons the other students might have supposed. She had a feeling about what this could be. Rumours had been flying for months on the sites she hung out at that a lab had developed a chemical or virus that could bond an animal&#39;s DNA with a human&#39;s, forming a hybrid -- an anthro. But that would be too good to be true.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t satisfied with this &quot;Dr. Harrison&#39;s&quot; answer to her question, but she lacked the nerve to ask any more. <i>Guess we&#39;ll just have to see.</i> The packet of questions was not any more revealing, though she was apparently expected to know some very <i>intimate</i> details about the animal she would be studying. Still, she was kind of excited for dinner.<br />
<br />
Smarts were about the only thing the young woman had. She was short, almost flat-chested, had stereotypical thick glasses. She did have a decent bottom, but it was so out of place on her otherwise skinny frame that it looked weird more than sexy. The unwanted runt of any social circle, she was almost invisible to boys and the target of choice for girls to take their frustrations out on.<br />
<br />
At least online her brain was all that mattered. Her dissatisfaction with her body had gotten her into the TF community, though she had herself been just a watcher and commenter, not being that interested in writing or drawing. Her dream actually was bioengineering.<br />
<br />
Driving home, she retired to her private sanctum -- also known as her room. She breezed through the more mundane homework, then whiled away the afternoon with video games and the internet. Being the only girl of three children meant she&#39;d always had a room to herself, with her brothers being forced to share, until Derek had joined the military.<br />
<br />
Before she knew it, Mrs. Benson was calling for dinner, and she went downstairs to join the rest of her family. They were a pretty nondescript bunch, really, Joel and Veronica; average middle-class parents, both working to afford a nice home. Her older brother had been rebellious and more conservative than his parents; her little brother, Joel Junior, was still a child and cute when he wasn&#39;t a nuisance.<br />
<br />
She mentioned the pill off-handedly, and basically shrugged at their questions. &quot;I don&#39;t know anything more than that I&#39;m supposed to take it after dinner. If I turn into an octopus I&#39;ll let you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
She retreated back to her room, taking a glass of water with her. Her mouth was dry from excitement, and that wouldn&#39;t be good for a chewable tablet. She took a drink, popped open the container. Her pill was aqua blue, just like the one the doctor had shown off; the same one for all she knew. She shook her held, took another drink, and popped the tablet in her mouth.<br />
<br />
At least it wasn&#39;t bad. It had a berry taste, artificial but not unpleasant. She swallowed and washed down the fragments with the rest of her water.<br />
<br />
<i>Now we&#39;ll see.</i> She sat on the edge of her bed, hands clutching her knees, staring at them, willing something to happen -- fur to sprout, boobs to appear. Something that would make her life better -- or at least more interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot; Then was a sudden cramping in her stomach. She bent forward, clutching at herself, but the pain soon passed, replaced by a warmth that filled her core and spread up her chest and down her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; She stood up excitedly, convinced now that she was changing. She tore off her shirt, skirt and panties (no need for a bra, she felt, when she had so little).<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh...&quot; There was something visible yet, but her privates were going from warm to hot. Arousal wasn&#39;t <i>completely</i> unexpected, but this felt... different. &quot;Nnnng-ahhhh...&quot; Her clitoris was throbbing, and expanding, almost like it was being pushed out of her body. And her insides were shifting, almost like her female anatomy was inverting. She could almost swear she could feel something passed down through her groin...<br />
<br />
She did take note as fur began to appear on her stomach. White hairs, quickly multiplying, spreading a soft carpet over her smooth skin. Her breasts faded away completely, her nipples diminishing and losing that aroused sensation she knew. Instead all her attention was drawn down to her clitoris... if it could still be called that.<br />
<br />
Her breath quickened, in excitement, fear... but mostly lust. Her little female button was now several inches long and growing. Now bright red, it was forming into a tapered shaft -- a shape she knew very well before the bulbus glandis began to swell at the base.<br />
<br />
<i>A canine...</i> &quot;Canine...&quot; Her groin clenched, balls dropped from what had been her vagina. &quot;Oh GOD!&quot; She grabbed the growing shaft with one hand, her mind hazed in red. &quot;Penis...!&quot; She squeezed, feeling it jump against her fingers. She began to pant. And to pump. The shaft thickened in her grasp, pointed tip emerging from her fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-ohh Goood...&quot; So caught up in pleasuring her new maleness that she scarcely noticed as her new pelt spread over her body, although she was stroking her front, unconsciously relishing the appearance of faint but tangible musculature.<br />
<br />
<i>It feels like... like something in me... got to get it out...!</i> She found herself pumping her hips into her hand, as her other hand fondled her ballsack, now large her furry, her canine shaft passing six inches, the knot swelling in her hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Semen...</i> That&#39;s what this fullness was... She knew how males worked, <i>in theory.</i> She just never thought she&#39;d feel this... this <i>need</i> --<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; Her sexual reverie was broken for a moment as her tailbone suddenly expanded, pushing a long grizzled orange brush out cross the bed. She jumped to her feet, startled, the tail waving wildly. She stopped fondlign her balls for a moment to reach back and grab it, marvelling at the strange feeling of having a limb where she shouldm&#39;t, at the feel of fur on her flesh. Though soon it was fur on fur, as her pelt swept over her hands, leaving them dark red, brown claws replacing blunt human nails, pads forming on fingertips and palms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... ah...&quot; The wonder of her new anatomy -- foxlike, but she knew from that black tip on her tail she was not a red fox -- could not long distract her from the needs of her maleness. She had continued to softly hunp her hand, and now as her mind was pulled back -- &quot;Goo-ood... iiit&#39;ssobiiiig...!&quot; She squeezed at it, yowled, and collapsed as her legs buckled with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Fortunately her rug -- and her tougher hide -- kept her knees form bruising as she landed on them, falling forward to catch herself on her right hand, glasses skittering unnoticed across the floor  while her left continued to service her rampant manhood. <i>God...</i> Growls issued from her throat as the heat of his lust spread through his body, his feet and even his face seeming to come erect, power coursing from his balls to toes, swelling them into paws; to his teeth, lengthening them into fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God... whyyy... oh...&quot; He rammed his knot into his own hand, as though it were a recalcitrant pussy. Being down on the floor like this seemed to have triggered something deep inside him. His claws dug into the floor, imagining a female beneath him, hot against his belly.<br />
<br />
They dug into his shaft -- and that made him yip, and release his grip a little. But that let him push his knot forward, and when he tightened his grip again --<br />
<br />
A human cry quickly morphed into a vulpine scream. The intense scent of seed hit his sensitive black-tipped nose as spurt after spurt shot into the rug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haa... haaa... haa...&quot; Slowly his mind cleared, his heart slowed. He put his other hand on the floor to help support his body as it gasped for air, his cock no longer needing his touch. He was still aware of it, pulling back into its sheath, but he no longer felt that... that drive to release. Now he just felt... proud. Powerful. Tired. But powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heheh.&quot; He licked his lips. &quot;Man... my orgasms were never that intense as a girl...&quot; And with a jolt the word reminded her that she <i>was</i> a girl, or had been. What was she now?<br />
<br />
She stood up, a little unsteady, but quickly adjusting to the new balance of tail and paws. She looked over herself. Still wreathed in afterglow, she felt no alarm at the loss of humanity, or even womanhood. She didn&#39;t even feel guilty about the mess she&#39;d made -- in fact, a new part of her felt it appropriate to mark her territory with her scent. An image of a female sniffing after it, lured by his musk, flickered through his mind, but quickly faded as curiosity about his new form replaced lust.<br />
<br />
She -- or he -- first noticed that he was taller, both from looking at his longer legs and torso, and from how everything in the room had shrunk. <i>I think I&#39;ve grown... at least a foot?</i> Actually, as he would find, more than a foot -- from 4&#39;9&quot; to 5&#39;11&quot;. Her build was trim but definitely masculine.<br />
<br />
The second thing she noticed was that her glasses had come to rest across the wall. And that she saw just fine without them. Her eyes widened. Reaching up, she felt around them, confirming that there was nothing filtering the world around her, and exploring the contours of his muzzle and fluffy cheeks at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is -- amazing! Wow, my voice...&quot; He hummed, noting his new, deeper voice had deepened. He liked it.<br />
<br />
And he liked what he saw as he examined his arms. He held them atop his head, feeling his mobile ears, as he looked left and right at his biceps. Not exactly muscular <i>yet</i> but her arms definitely suited a male. bringing them down to look at her forearms, she noted they were gloved almost up to the shoulder in a fetching shade of red. She flexed her claws, noting she could not retract them very far, admiring the dark pads contrasting against the fur.<br />
<br />
Speaking of contrast, from what she could tell, her back, shoulder, tail and outer thighs were an orange-red heavily flecked with grey; which faded into white on her chin and front and inner thighs. In contrast to her red arms, her lower legs were cream-coloured.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only I had a mirror. Oh wait -- duh...&quot; He picked up his phone, and took several pictures of himself. This allowed him to see a black stripe running down his back all the way to the black end of his foxy brush. He took several more, just posing, and imagining how he&#39;d look once he&#39;d exercised.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Huh.&quot; First time she&#39;d ever fantasised about exercise. But then... maybe this was the first time he&#39;d ever been excited about his body. He ran a hand down his front, stopped to pat his sheath. To her surprise, the contact immediately brought a stirring without, and she saw her red tip poking out at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot; Now that the first rush of the transformation was over, though, she felt a bit anxious. That... that powerful feeling... it had felt so good at the time, but... could she control it?<br />
<br />
She pushed the thought out of her mind. She had more pressing concerns. Like -- someone knocking on her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey?&quot; asked her mother&#39;s voice. &quot;Are you okay in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, mom,&quot; she answered, suddenly self-conscious about her deeper voice. &quot;I&#39;m fine. Just... experiencing the effects of that pill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodness! Did it turn you into a boy or something!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah it did. Um... could you get Dad? I think I&#39;m going to need to borrow his clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
While she waited for Joel Benson Senior to arrive, she picked up her phone. It didn&#39;t take her long to identify her new species. She&#39;d turned into an anthropomorphic culpeo fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; Misgivings about being male or not, she couldn&#39;t help but feel excited.</p>
