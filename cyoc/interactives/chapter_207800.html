<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jodie stood before the toilet and took her time aiming at the bowl. Still getting used to the fact that she was male down there, she found the most she could do at the moment was to gingerly touch the bright red penis that was now extended out of her fur-covered sheath. Scared that if she touched it any more than she had to that it&#39;d grow hard, she forced herself to relax and after a bit, she started to pee. Shifting slightly as her stream almost went out of the bowl, she wondered how guys managed to pee standing up without pissing all over the place. Finishing, she grabbed some toilet paper to wipe herself, and shuddered when the soft tissue came in contact with the tip of her dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably don&#39;t need to do that any more, but I&#39;m going to anyway,&quot; she thought as she tossed the toilet paper into the toilet and flushing, she watched as her canine penis retracted back into her sheath before she started to zip back up the jeans.<br />
<br />
Being careful still not zip herself up in the process, she adjusted her now fur-covered tail so it wasn&#39;t pinched, button the single button, stepped over to the sink and turned on the water to wash her hands. As she did, she took a couple deep breaths and tried to ignore how it felt to have a fur covered penile sheath rubbing against the inside of the jeans, to feel a set of balls dangling down and brushing her leg, to have a tail down one pants leg. Finding she was still coming to terms with what had happened, her mind drifted to the breakfast she and Nathan had prepared, which they&#39;d been in the process of finishing when she&#39;d excused herself to go use the bathroom, as she gazed into the mirror above the sink.<br />
<br />
Her familiar female face stared back at her and she wondered how long it would before she saw the face of a dog looking back at her. Suppressing a shudder at what she believed was the inevitable outcome unless she used the Amulet of Zulo, still hung around her neck, Jodie dried off her hands. Wanting first to help Nathan before she turned herself back, she started to considered how low it might take, but stopped when she saw something about eyes was different. Leaning closer, seeing it was that her eyes had darkened from a light brown to a dark brown that was almost black, she thought, &quot;Great,&quot; as she turned away from the mirror, adjusted the belt she had  on and exited the bathroom. Heading back to the kitchen where Nathan was still morosely picking at his meal, Jodie sat down with her legs spread, much in the same a guy would, and looked at the plate of three-quarters eaten food, but didn&#39;t reach for her fork to finish the rest of it.<br />
<br />
Her mind going back to the conversation she and Nathan had been in the middle of before she excused herself, she went back over most of it as she tried to figure out where to pick it up from. Finding some parts troubling, she thought the most bothersome was when they both had realised that something had shifted and they were no longer engaged to be married. Conflicted about such a development, she was even more so when Nathan had suggested that it might be because they were regressing back to age of seventeen, a point when neither had even considered the possibility that one day they&#39;d want to get married. Wondering if this was the reason why, she mulled over how it could be they were regressing back in age if they were turning into a couple dogs. Toying with the idea that it wasn&#39;t so much that they were regressing back, but because reality had started to shift so that it was that they&#39;d always been canines, she dryly thought, &quot;Dogs don&#39;t get married. They pair up when needed, but otherwise are solitary.&quot;<br />
<br />
A seat over, Nathan was lost in his own thoughts. Several things ate at him, but the biggest he found was his transforming body. When Jodie had gotten up to go to the bathroom, he&#39;d thought he noticed something about her stance, the way she walked, and after she&#39;d left the room, it came to him it was all rather masculine. Wondering if he&#39;d also changed in the way he moved, he looked down at himself, stared at the t-shirt he had on, and after a moment, stood and returned to the bedroom. Slipping inside, he headed toward the mirror Jodie kept on the back of the closet door, and opening the closet, he peered into the reflective surface.<br />
<br />
For the most part, he still looked like himself. The clothes were wrong, as they were things Jodie had picked out for him from her dresser, and turning one way, then another, Nathan concluded that the way he stood, held himself, was the same way a woman would. Stepping back, he watched the way he put his feet, walked forward, moved around a bit, and decided that even the way he walked, putting one foot in front of the other, which gave his a gait a slight shake in the hips, it was the same way Jodie had done so before their encounter with the Amulet of Zulo. Stepping back in front of the mirror, he stared at his head, his face and short hair still that of dude, and after a moment, reached down and pulled up on the hem of the shirt.<br />
<br />
Teats exposed, Nathan shivered at the sight of them. The four extra nipples were bigger, now about the size of breast buds, if not a smidge bigger, whilst the two highest ones stuck out in what was clearly a double A cup. Staring at the developing breasts, somehow knowing they were actually supposed to be a B cup,  he tried to sort out how he could be turning into a bitch if he was developing breasts. Confused about what he was suddenly knowing and what was happening to him, Nathan pulled the shirt down over his sensitive teats. Leaving the bedroom, hearing the faucet in the bathroom, he returned to the kitchen and sat down to finish his breakfast, but found he could only pick at it.<br />
<br />
When Jodie had returned, his mind flashed back to what he&#39;d saw, and it was with a start, it came to him that she was taller. Pegging her height at about five foot eight, he thought back to what he&#39;d seen in the mirror, but couldn&#39;t determine if he&#39;d looked shorter or not. Failing to realise that his height had dropped from five eleven down to five foot three, Nathan cleared his throat. Getting Jodie&#39;s attention, he picked up their conversation from earlier by clarifying, &quot;So, after breakfast, we are going back to your grandmama&#39;s house and find that book?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sounds like the plan,&quot; Jodie replied and with a sigh, understanding she was no longer going to eat anything, she pushed away her plate and said, &quot;I think we also need to do something about our clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan looked down at what he had on and with a nod, he agreed. Not liking the notion he&#39;d have to wear girl&#39;s clothes, he knew that he&#39;d have to until they could find a way to transform back. Glancing over at Jodie, he muttered, &quot;Yeah,&quot; then added, &quot;I hate to say this, but I think I&#39;m going to need a bra and nipple pasties.&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know why, but the idea of her former fiancé wearing bras, panties, struck her as funny until, with a sobering thought, it came to her that it was what she used to wear, but couldn&#39;t any longer. Reaching for her plate, she stood and headed for the sink. Placing the dish next to it, she asked over her shoulder, &quot;If there&#39;s any help I can provide, let me know,&quot; as her mind rebelled at the notion of knowing anything about a girl&#39;s undergarments.<br />
<br />
Nathan muttered a thanks as he stood. Collecting the rest of the dishes and flatware from the table, he took the stuff over and deposited it next to Jodie’s. Suddenly needing to be comforted, he hugged Jodie, who returned the gesture, even as it came to her that she was now taller. Standing there for a moment, they soon pushed away from each other and it was Nathan who broke the silence by saying, &quot;Sorry. It&#39;s just that, since this whole thing started, I don&#39;t how to explain it, but I&#39;ve been, I don&#39;t know, more emotional. And I don&#39;t know if that is even accurate, though I do know it would be so when I say that I feel more vulnerable,&quot; and looking up at Jodie, he asked, &quot;Do you feel this way? Or, should I ask did you feel this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know how to answer his question. Drawing him back into a hug, Jodie considered it before she eventually told him, &quot;I felt like that sometimes. More prominently so at certain points in my life, like when I went through puberty, or when I had my monthly,&quot; before she gave a gruff bark-like laugh and commented, &quot;Or, I think I did. If I really give it some thought, I find it hard to focus on it, almost like a dream half remembered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each troubled by how much their body and mind was transforming, it was Jodie who released Nathan as she stepped away. Glancing at the dishes by the sink, figuring they could wait, she stated, &quot;We should get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod of agreement from Nathan and they each went to look for their shoes. Finding they&#39;d have to wear the other&#39;s footwear, they each found in their own way they&#39;d be glad when things could return to how they used to be. Jodie slipping Nathan&#39;s wallet into her pants pocket as Nathan slung the strap of Jodie&#39;s purse over his shoulder, they gave the other a slight smile as one collected the apartment keys and the other took the car keys. Leaving the apartment, believing they were as prepared as they were going to be to face the world, they headed downstairs, were they got their first shock of how much reality was changing around them as they found that not only was Nathan&#39;s car not parked where it usually was, but that it and Jodie&#39;s vehicle were gone, erased as if they&#39;d never existed.</p>
