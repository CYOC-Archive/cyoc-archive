<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin felt his nipples itch and tried to scratch one when he suddenly felt it was big and soft, almost like his foster-sister&#39;s. Alarmed, he looked down on himself to see two firm, hairless bumps, much smaller than hers but with similarly swollen nipples and big brown areolas.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... got boobs?!&quot; he said disbelievingly.<br />
&quot;Looks like it.&quot; Ty replied with a smile on her face.<br />
&quot;Did you... make those?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;<br />
&quot;But how? And... why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s hard to explain but apparently I&#39;m a witch or something. I can change things with my wishes.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s impossible. Time to get rid of those fake things&quot; Dustin said and tried to pull off his left breast. It stretched and hurt. &quot;Ow!!&quot; he yelled.<br />
&quot;Be careful, they&#39;re sensitive! Especially during lactation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Lactation?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, those are making milk. See?&quot; She pointed at his left nipple, and indeed a white-yellowish droplet of milk had formed on it.<br />
&quot;Why did you give me lactating boobs?&quot; Dustin asked, bewildered.<br />
&quot;I saw the way you look at me when I feed Jenna. I saw love in your eyes, but also longing, and I thought you felt left out in a way. So I thought you might want to breastfeed her yourself once, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ty explained.<br />
&quot;Well... you&#39;re right, I sometimes feel almost jealous when I see the intimacy between you and our daughter and I&#39;m afraid I can never be so close to her and fulfill her needs, bottle-feeding just isn&#39;t the same. But I can&#39;t have breasts, I&#39;m a guy!&quot; Dustin said.<br />
&quot;I can return your chest to normal whenever you want. But don&#39;t you want to try and see what it feels like, just for tonight?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
&quot;Wow, can I really? Then I want to try.&quot; Dustin said emotionally.<br />
&quot;Great. By the way, they look really cute.&quot; Ty said playfully.<br />
&quot;Really? Aren&#39;t they a bit small?&quot; Dustin asked, cupping his breasts in his hands, which they just didn&#39;t fill the same way as Tyler&#39;s<br />
&quot;Aww, look at that, you haven&#39;t even had boobs for five minutes and you&#39;re insecure about them already. See, that&#39;s what many girls feel like all the time. But they aren&#39;t too small, I made them to fit your body. They would be barely visible without lactation, almost like your normal chest. Now with the milk in them they&#39;re small B cups. Remember how mine changed during pregnancy and after birth?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s amazing.&quot; Dustin said and leaned in to kiss her, noticing their nipples touching each other - an odd feeling, but not a bad one.<br />
&quot;Thanks, darling.&quot; Ty said and they kissed passionately.<br />
She felt Dustin&#39;s hands gently touching her breasts, and almost automatically her left hand reached out to his right breast. She&#39;d never touched someone else&#39;s boobs before, and never thought she wanted to, but right now she found the soft, swollen flesh fascinating. She felt the nipple harden and get wet with milk under her touch. Suddenly, Dustin pushed her hand away and broke the kiss. &quot;Don&#39;t&quot;, he said.<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry baby. Did I hurt you?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
&quot;No, it didn&#39;t feel bad, it&#39;s that... I don&#39;t know. It felt good. But I&#39;m a guy. And it&#39;s for breastfeeding, not for making out, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Jenna doesn&#39;t seem to mind. But if you don&#39;t want me to touch yours, it&#39;s ok. Actually I felt a bit like that in the beginning.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? You never told me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I was afraid you wouldn&#39;t want me any more if I didn&#39;t let you play with them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Tyler, I&#39;m so sorry. I don&#39;t want to do anything in bed you don&#39;t want!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok. You were always gentle and careful enough to make it feel good, and soon I figured out that I like it, Jenna obviously doesn&#39;t care so there&#39;s no reason not to touch them, even though they&#39;re plump and ugly and always leaking milk.&quot;<br />
&quot;How often do I have to tell you they&#39;re perfect?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
Ty just hugged and kissed him in response. He gently caressed her breasts, and she let her hand wander into his pants. His dick was already pretty hard and welcomed Ty‘s attention, but honestly Dustin felt more interested in what kind of pleasure his new breasts could provide. He wanted to know what his favourite kind of foreplay was like for Ty, and she was right – Jenna wouldn‘t mind what other purposes her sources of food served. So he tenderly grabbed Ty‘s wrist and placed her hand on his breast. „Show me what it‘s like“ he whispered. She gently drew a circle around his nipple with her index finger and it immediately hardened again, with more milk coming out. Dustin felt great as she caressed his breast and returned the favor. Sexual tension kept rising and soon their other hands were busy with each other‘s genitals. „Thank you so much!“ Dustin panted. „Fuck me!“ Ty replied. Dustin knew she only used that language when she was extremely horny, and so was he, so he quickly rolled on top of her and slid his throbbing dick into her wet vagina for the second time that night. But this time he felt he wouldn‘t last long, the unusual breast stimulation had brought him close to climax already. After a few thrusts he came into her. „Sorry, baby, the boobs were just too much.“ he said. „Aww, did I overwhelm you?“ Ty mocked. „I‘m so glad my husband knows what to do in such a case.“ Indeed Dustin knew, and after a few minutes he‘d brought Ty to orgasm with his fingers.<br />
<br />
After, as they held each other close, Dustin couldn‘t get one thought out of his head.<br />
„Uh… are you still awake?“ he asked.<br />
„Yeah, why?“ Ty yawned.<br />
„I wondered… could you change a whole body?“<br />
„Yeah, I think so. Do you want some more changes?“<br />
„Would you… make me a woman for a night? I‘d like to know what it feels like.“<br />
„I could. But under two conditions. First, you‘d have to make out with me as a girl.“<br />
„I… wow, I‘d love to do that. But… are you into girls too? I never knew.“<br />
„Neither did I, but those boobs of yours gave me ideas. Now the other condition. I‘d… I‘d like to turn into a guy and have sex with you as a girl. Of course only if you‘re okay with it, I don‘t want to do anything you aren‘t fully comfortable with, but I always wondered what it feels like as a guy.“<br />
„Hm… that way I could learn what sex is like for you. But I don‘t know… the idea of touching someone else‘s dick grosses me out a bit. But maybe it‘ll be different when I‘m a girl and it‘s your dick. We could try.“<br />
„Tomorrow night?“<br />
„Tomorrow night.“<br />
They kissed and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
When they‘d just fallen asleep, Jenna‘s squalling reminded them that they had more to care about than their sex lives. Dustin got up, yawned and stretched, tired, but also excited he‘d get to breastfeed his daughter himself. His breasts felt really full and were starting to tingle. He took Jenna from her bassinet and sat down on the bed with her. The direct contact made her stop crying. Dustin tried to hold her the way Ty did for breastfeeding, but it felt kind of awkward and he got really insecure. „Am I holding her right?“ he asked Ty. She looked over in the dawn light.<br />
„Yeah, don‘t worry. Just take care that she takes more than just the nipple into her mouth or it‘ll hurt. Do your boobs feel strange?“<br />
„A bit, they‘re really full and tingling.“<br />
„That‘s great, it‘s the letdown reflex. It means you‘ll have enough milk for her.“<br />
Dustin held Jenna close to his right breast. First she kept her mouth shut, and he wondered if she was hungry at all, but then she suddenly opened it and latched on. He felt her tongue pressing the nipple against the roof of her mouth again and again, pushing out the milk which she gulped down quickly. It was a kind of feeling he‘d never known before, neither painful nor sexual. He actually felt closer to Jenna then ever before.<br />
„Wow. This is amazing!“ Dustin said, with tears in his eyes. „Yeah. That‘s what it was like for me the first few times.“<br />
„Thank you so much for letting me experience it.“<br />
„Thank you for being such a great parent. Not all dads are prepared to feed their kids themselves.“<br />
After about ten minutes, Jenna stopped sucking, but still kept the nipple in her mouth.<br />
„I think she‘s done on this breast, should I give her the other one?“ Dustin asked, but Ty had already fallen asleep. He decided not to wake up his sister-wife. His left breast still felt full and looked bigger, so he carefully turned the baby around and tried to get her to suck again. This time he had to actually touch her face with the nipple to make her latch on, and she only took a few gulps, but at least the pressure was slightly relieved. When she was done, he burped her and she spit up some of his own milk on him, but Dustin didn‘t mind at all. He enjoyed the closeness he felt to his little family. Jenna had fallen asleep on his shoulder, and he managed to carefully put her into her bassinet without waking her up.<br />
Dustin got back to sleep as well, already looking forward to the next night.</p>
