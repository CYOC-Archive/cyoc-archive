<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, that went fairly well,” Cynthia commented as Michelle and Jasmine left the living room and went through the open doorway into the kitchen. “They didn’t tease you.”<br />
<br />
Rachel shook her head and tilted one ear to try and listen in on her mother and sisters in the kitchen. She could hear the footsteps go across the tile as they went out of sight and actually toward the dining room, which took them further away from the living room or where they could easily snoop in on Rachel and Cynthia. Rachel was grateful for that, but she was sure that Michelle and Jasmine had overheard at least part of the discussion regarding her mother’s idea about becoming a werecat just to help Rachel. Rachel hoped that her mother wouldn’t continue with that idea after making her point directly. Though as things settled in between her and Cynthia, Rachel wouldn’t be able to listen in on her mother and sisters.<br />
<br />
“That would be a good thing, right?” Cynthia asked.<br />
<br />
“They didn’t tease me now,” Rachel answered, “probably because you’re here and mom was talking with you as much as with me. So, it wouldn’t make sense for them to tease me into rushing into a relationship.”<br />
<br />
Rachel didn’t mention the butterflies in her stomach as she looked to Cynthia. She watched as Cynthia brushed a few strands of her red hair back with a hand and made a small smile. It all furthered the private feelings of Rachel being cute, and feelings that were pushed forward by learning that Cynthia was bi and that she would have interest in other women.<br />
<br />
“But that won’t stop them from pulling something later, when you aren’t here,” Rachel then finished, which actually got Cynthia to chuckle a bit.<br />
<br />
“That sounds like typical little sister behavior,” Cynthia chuckled, “something I know all too well. In fact, I probably did some of the same things to tease my brother from time to time. It was my way of showing him I loved him. And he ultimately took it in stride and became my protector growing up. It made for a happy family that I’m glad to have. And in a way, I’d think you’re probably glad to have your sisters, too.”<br />
<br />
Rachel chuckled a bit and then nodded. There were always the times where Jasmine and Michelle could be annoying, particularly when they found something they knew they could tease Rachel on and truly get her frustrated. But at the same time, they’d also accepted Rachel being a lesbian as quickly as their mother did and they accepted her being a werecat without any problem. In this, it was a warm family bond, which in a sense made the Covaks family her pride before the move to Moon Lake and did a lot to help her master the basics, because she knew her family loved her.<br />
<br />
“I suppose you got me there,” Rachel admitted, “so what about you? Did you ever tease your brother on his girlfriends growing up or things like that? Does he…?”<br />
<br />
“My brother and parents know I’m bi, yes,” Cynthia nodded, “and they accepted it easily, because they also knew my aunt is bi and by the time I was born, we’d been in Moon Lake for a few years.”<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Rachel said with a sigh and a small smile, &quot;you didn&#39;t have to deal with a homophobic parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, from what you&#39;ve told me... your dad was a piece of work,&quot; Cynthia commented, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean my family hasn&#39;t had its issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Issues...?&quot; Rachel asked, her voice dropping into a more worried tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Cynthia began to recount.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m telling you, I&#39;m fine!&quot; an older sounding female voice grumbled as a ten-year-old Cynthia Fredericks came in from the backyard with a thirteen-year-old Lucy Wesley following.<br />
<br />
The two normal human girls had been enjoying some summer fun tossing a frisbee around with one of the neighbor boys. It made for a lot of running around and allowed for a fair amount joyful laughter as they chased it down. The boy was quick enough to make it look like he wasn&#39;t really trying to get there, but he always seemed to. But it had been a hot and dry day, for Washington state, and after the boy found himself with some yard chores to help his family, Cynthia and Lucy came in to get some juice. Though, as they came in, they found Julia Wesley helping an older looking woman sit back into a comfortable chair. The older woman in her youth had vibrant red hair that matched Cynthia’s, Lucy’s, and Julia’s, but it had been steadily going silver and grey over the past ten years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria, you&#39;re NOT fine,&quot; came Julia&#39;s response, filled with worry and concern, &quot;you very nearly fell down in the kitchen and dropped a mug onto the floor and I saw you clutch at your chest when it happened. You need to sit and rest while I call the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Momma?&quot; Cynthia spoke, getting Julia and Maria to turn to face Cynthia and Lucy. A part of Cynthia felt real fear when she saw her aunt&#39;s eyes widen while her mother seemed to cringe at something. A part of Maria&#39;s face showed a bit of resistance to what Julia had just said, but she thought there was some pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, dear,&quot; Maria spoke quickly in a pained voice, &quot;just a bit dizzy. Nothing to worry about, other than a baby sister trying to mother me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see what the doctors says,&quot; Julia answered, &quot;and I don&#39;t think you are, and I&#39;m not going to let you be stubborn about this. Not with your husband working and with Cynthia here still being rather young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on, mom?&quot; Lucy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your aunt had a bit of a dizzy spell and looked out of it,&quot; Julia answered, &quot;it&#39;s left a mess in the kitchen and has me worried... worried for the closest living person to me outside of you and your father. My big sister who taught me everything growing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be alright, right momma?&quot; Cynthia asked as she approached her mother and took her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, baby,&quot; Maria forced a smile, &quot;your aunt is just being overly worried that&#39;s all. What brought you in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Billy had to go help is dad and we wanted some juice,&quot; Lucy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ung, the kitchen is a bit of a mess with broken glass...&quot; Julia spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a broom? And a something to brush it onto?&quot; Lucy asked, &quot;I&#39;ll help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in the little pantry room on the other side of the kitchen,&quot; Maria spoke from the chair while noting Julia going for her cellphone.<br />
<br />
Lucy started to move in that direction. Ordinarily, Cynthia would have happily followed her cousin, as despite being a couple of years younger than her cousin, she got along quite well with Lucy and Lucy had always been there for her. Particularly as her older brother, Simon, by now had graduated college and was working for Moon Lake&#39;s Fire Department. He wasn&#39;t around every day or all the time, and at times Cynthia didn&#39;t like that, and so she made good friends with her cousin and those in the neighborhood. But the present situation wasn&#39;t ordinary, as her momma seemed to be in pain. That left Cynthia just holding her mother&#39;s hand. It was only when she felt a hand on her shoulder that she looked up to find Julia looking to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to make a call to the hospital and help Lucy&#39;s efforts,&quot; Julia spoke, &quot;Cynithia, I need you to be a big girl and make sure Maria doesn&#39;t get out of that chair or strain herself further. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, auntie,&quot; Cynthia managed, her own voice beginning to quiver as she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, baby,&quot; Maria insisted, &quot;don&#39;t worry...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And ultimately she was,&quot; Cynthia then concluded, &quot;but Aunt Julia was right. My mom had had a very mild heart-attack and triggered the incident in question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A heart attack!&quot; Rachel gasped, her ears going alert, &quot;but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, it was my elder brother, Simon, who became our family&#39;s were,&quot; Cynthia answered, &quot;as he was nearly fifteen when we moved here... and I was born about a year or so after. And this left my parents as normal humans as well... which would leave them more vulnerable to things like heart disease.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your parents couldn&#39;t become weres?&quot; Rachel wondered, &quot;I mean, either you or Julia said they were fans of &quot;the Howling,&quot; one would think that they&#39;d want to be weres... and probably werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did... but they didn&#39;t want to have sex with someone other than each other,&quot; Cynthia spoke as she looked down for a moment, &quot;thus they never could take that plunge. Though they did ultimately find an artist in Moon Lake who sketched them with Simon in his werewolf form, and they keep it on their bedroom wall as a sort of &quot;fanart&quot; piece. No one would know it&#39;s a family picture with a real werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel blinked for a moment as Cynthia continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And because my mother is about ten years older than my aunt, had my brother while fairly young and was in her early forties when she had me,&quot; Cynthia continued, &quot;she&#39;s too old now to become a were, even if the sexual side of things wasn&#39;t there or there was a way to get around that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rachel found herself saying, thinking it would make Cynthia feel better. She only got a laugh in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you have nothing to be sorry for, and my parents are at peace with their choices,&quot; Cynthia spoke, &quot;they take great pride in my brother and in me, and if I become a were... they want me to pose with them for the same Moon Lake artist that drew them with Simon in his werewolf form. Showing a strong and loving family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good... though, that&#39;d have to mean your aunt is around forty now, right?&quot; Rachel wondered, &quot;if your mom was in her forties when she had you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Julia is in her fifties now,&quot; Cynthia answered, &quot;but as weres, her and Uncle Linus&#39; aging as slowed way down. And they could have new children for quite a while yet, without ever looking older than their early to mid-twenties. One of those benefits of being a were. Provided you don&#39;t meet a violent end or catch one of the few diseases that weres are susceptible to, you will be around for a very long time. My mom is in her sixties now, and she did recover from her heart-attack, though she insisted to my father and my brother that she was fine. &quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel chuckled a bit and then thought of something, &quot;that&#39;s what got you to be the helper that was mentioned at the meeting... caring for your mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Cynthia answered, &quot;as I owe her a lot, and for the most part, I&#39;m still at home. So, it makes sense. Though, as I&#39;ve grown up more and mom got better... I found it actually felt good to be there for others. It gave me a sense of purpose... and in some ways, it&#39;s helped me find friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d gladly be a friend,&quot; Rachel said to her, while a part of her mind thought, &quot;and maybe more... if you want me...&quot;</p>
