<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What game should we play?&quot; Lance asked his sister that used to be her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom will probably be gone for a little bit so we can play a longer game but I still want it to be short.&quot; Jessica ponder what to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;what about hungry hungry hippo?&quot; Lance was at a game closet for the family and had pulled out the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;That works for me.&quot; Jessica scooted over to a little table in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. I am a beast at this game.&quot; Lance said as he brought the game out and put it on the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, if we are playing a game that you are good at. Let me know what you are planning on taking if you win.&quot; Jessica stopped him before he finished setting up the game. She wasn&#39;t going to possibly let him have an easy win if he was taking something serious. She would ask for a different game.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmm. I like your hair color so I would ask for that.&quot; Of all the things that happen when he and Lucy became who they are, Lance missed the auburn hair that his siblings had.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is fine with me.&quot; Jessica shrugged. Her hair color wasn&#39;t that serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;alright, here you go.&quot; Lance handed Jessica one of the silver necklaces while he put his one on. The game was set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets eat!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was fierce battle as the two twins battle for the small little balls. The bounce everywhere as the bounce everywhere. Lance and Jessica were desperately trying to swallow as many as they could. It always seem like one was swallowed the other person snatched two. It came down to one ball in the middle, both fighting intensely for last one. The ball suddenly moved over to Lance.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mine&quot; He yelled.<br />
<br />
His hippo mouth came down to take it but it bounce off the rim towards Jessica&#39;s hippo. Jessica was waiting and her hippo swallowed the ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it.&quot; Jessica pumped her fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang it.&quot; Lance banged his fist on the table at the lost of the last ball. &quot;We need to count&#39;em up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance began to count his balls while Jessica counted hers. <br />
<br />
&quot;I got twenty-two, what do you have?&quot; Lance asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;19...20...21...22...23. I have twenty three.&quot; Jessica giggled excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;damn it!&quot; Lance leaned back and slapped his face. &quot;That last one was the winning ball. Alright, what do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;hmm.&quot; Jessica hummed. &quot;Since I got twenty three balls, I would like to be twenty three. I want ten of your years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance couldn&#39;t believe what Jessica said. He was expecting his hair color or something like that. He forgot to ask Jessica would want if she won. He would have chosen a game based less on chance and more on actual skill. Either way, the deed was done.<br />
<br />
Jessica started to get taller and older at the same time. Her hips and breasts expanded to give her some nice curves. Her face changed and matured to resemble the maturity she was gaining. Soon, she was looking like a younger version of Mom, more tone though. Lance was amazed at how much Jessica was going to look like her old body. Her clothes changed to cut off jeans and a white t-shirt with a cute teddy face logo that stretched out on her big bust.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this a lot. I should get bigger more often.&quot; Jessica jiggled one of her big tits. &quot;but I like you smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance realized he had changed as well. He was cling to the edge of a bigger table now. It wasn&#39;t bigger, he was smaller. He found himself in baggy jeans and a stripe shirt. His limbs were fat and short. He also had a little belly. He suddenly found himself in a bad place. He had turned to three years old and had wet his pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I have to clean that.&quot; Jessica said as she stood up. She walked over to the side of a chair that a bag right next to it. She pulled out a mat and diaper and carried it over to the table. Jessica scooted the game away and set the mat on that. She then left Lance up and onto the mat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need this.&quot; Jessica pulled the silver necklace off Lance before taking her one off. The effects were no permanent. Jessica pulled his pants off and then his diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;aww, Lancy has a little wiener.&quot; Jessica teased Lance as she changed his diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is not funny.&quot; Lance grumbled. He didn&#39;t like his new age. He was being handle by his older sister that took his age for the purpose of changing a diaper. He was so embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kid. now move along. Go. Play in your room.&quot; Jessica sealed up his pants before placing him on the ground and patting his butt. She was continuing to teasing him. <br />
<br />
Lance did not like the butt tap but he did as he was told and went to the hallway to play in his room. He turned around before going into the depths. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bleah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lance stuck out his tongue and went to his room. Jessica giggle at his childish behavior as she picked up. She picked up the game and stuff the necklaces in her pocket. She was feeling a little hungry so she went to kitchen to get a snack. She was grabbing some chips when Lucy opened the door and came inside. Jenny was following her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica. Jenny lost her keys to her house somewhere in her front yard. We can&#39;t find where they are. We are going to get a copy of the spare we have here. The question I&#39;m asking is can you help us and if you do. Do you want to look for the lost key or make a copy?&quot;</p>
