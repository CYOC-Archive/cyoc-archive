<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She couldn&#39;t beat that thing.  Who could?  So she ran.  She ran and left her friends to die while Merek pitted the power of the Eye against the great abomination.  She didn&#39;t care.  She was too much of a succubus to care. She only regretted not being able to fuck them before they died.  <br />
<br />
She escaped and prowled through the forest, seeking prey, seeking to fuck.  She noted that there was now a timer until her human soul would die. Nine minutes left.  Good.  It was a nuisance, sitting in the back of her mind crying about those worthless friends of hers.  Maybe if she devoured a few souls it would speed things along.<br />
<br />
Then she saw them:  two humans!  She didn&#39;t know what they were doing in the forest, but she didn&#39;t care.  They were both male.  She&#39;d charm them both at once.  Would they share her holes, or tear each other apart in fighting over her?  Pondering it amused her.<br />
<br />
She stepped out of the flora cover, seductively walking towards them.  &quot;Well, hello boys.&quot; she said.  They turned around.  One of them was Luke?  That was strange, but it didn&#39;t matter.  His soul would taste as good as any other, and she already knew he could fuck.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Lily, is that you?&quot;  asked Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, lover dear, don&#39;t recognize me?&quot;  she said.  Luke started to step forward, but the other human, an old man in white and gold robes, held him back with one hand.  &quot;Stay yourself, boy.  That&#39;s a succubus!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s my girlfriend.  She&#39;s only half succubus.&quot; said Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Half?&quot; said the old man, &quot;Then there may yet be hope.  She is far gone, but I will do what I can.&quot;  Suddenly a staff appeared in his hand and he pointed it at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you rather point a different rod at me, old man?&quot;  asked Lillian with a wink.  She realized he was probably some sort of wizard, but there was no way he could resist her power now.  Her eyes flared as she activated Charm on both of them...but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darkness and lust will not avail you, demon!&quot; said the old man as his staff began to glow.  He&#39;d protected himself AND Luke from her Charm skill?  He was strong!  She looked at his stats<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Name: Sildref Graywing<br />
Lv. 30 Arch Wizard, lv 30 Light Archon<br />
HP: 150/150<br />
MP: 800/800<br />
Element: Light<br />
Information: One of the five Arch Mages, Sildref has achieved Mastery in 2 different schools of magic, and exceeds normal conceptions of human power limits through unknown means.  He is a leading authority on demons and how to fight them.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
Well, she was fucked, wasn&#39;t she?  and not in the good way.  She turned to flee, but found herself bound to the spot.  Looking down she saw that a white magic circle had appeared beneath her.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;By the light of A&#39;niel, by the holy love of Mirtha, and by we the many children of that union-&quot;  As the Wizard chanted she desperately struggled to escape the circle, but it was no use, and now he was finishing.  &quot;I seal thee, succubus.  Begone, and never return again.&quot;<br />
<br />
A great light shot forth from his staff and struck the circle, and then an even greater light erupted from the circle.  Luke shielded his eyes to avoid being blinded as the succubus cried out in pain.<br />
<br />
When the light faded, all that was left was a crying human girl that not even her boyfriend could console.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Days passed with Lillian holed up in her room at the inn.  She wouldn&#39;t talk to anyone.  She just sat in her room, alternating between tears and a bleak silence.  Sildref paid for her stay in the inn when her funds ran out.<br />
<br />
The wizard sat in the next room conversing with Luke now.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you find out what happened?&quot; asked Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly.  All I can say is that her party must have encountered great evil.  I think I know what caused her to lose herself to her succubus side though.  When I found the apparent scene of a great battle, the likely climax of things, there was something in the center of the carnage.  It ought to have been covered in blood, but it was perfectly clean, and it sat there emanating an aura of satisfaction at the bloodshed, if an inanimate object can do such a thing.  It was an ancient demon artifact of great power.  I will not even mention what I suspect it to be, and you should never speak of it.  I dared not touch it, and instead cast numerous wards and seals around it.  It lies there still.  I will gather the other Arch Mages and we will return to destroy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could someone steal it in the meantime?&quot; asked Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not easily, with the protections I put around it.  It would take someone special indeed to defeat my magic. But we cannot post a guard, for I fear the thing has an evil allure to it that would corrupt the hearts of anyone sent to guard it.  Even I was tempted to take it for myself.  I tell you because I know you have a good and strong heart, Luke, and beyond that you seem to have...well, if I believed in such things, I&#39;d say you had good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke would have laughed, if he wasn&#39;t too worried about things.<br />
<br />
&quot;It certainly was lucky that you came upon me while delivering those weapons,&quot; said the old mage, &quot;and that we decided to travel together so that I was with you when you found her.  Otherwise you would be dead, and she&#39;d be a demon.  You were lucky not to have been with the party as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I am lucky, then she is unlucky.  I wish I could share some luck with her.&quot; said Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.  How is she doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She still won&#39;t talk.  I did get her to eat something today though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrible.  I have heard there is a special light mage in Raneer who specializes in healing afflictions of the mind and heart.  Raneer is along my path.  I will tell her she is needed here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re leaving now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  I must gather the other Arch Mages immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke nodded, and they shook hands.  &quot;It was a pleasure to meet you, young man.&quot; said the wizard. Luke returned the sentiment, and then watched the wizard leave.</p>
