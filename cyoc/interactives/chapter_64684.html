<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">April sat in the shower, slowly rocking back and forth, staring at nothing in particular as the now cold water of the shower ran over her. After a few minutes, she gazed down at what she now knew was never going to go away, no matter how much she attempted to scrub it away or even ignore it. Looking away, she stared at the wall, her mind on what was clearly now a serious patch of fur, some white, the rest red, and what she had done to deserve this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Penis,&quot; she muttered and looking down at the sheath, she tentatively touched it and watched as the red shaft extended forward, not quite hard, but somewhere in a near flaccid state.<br />
<br />
Shuddering from both the cold water pouring over her and sense of being horrified at what was happening and what had happened, she began to rock back and forth, muttering every once and a bit, &quot;Can't get warm. It's all so unreal,&quot; listening to the water hit the tile and the silent house around her, knowing that she was the only one home because she was the only one she could smell.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she reached out and turned off the shower, but did not exit and instead remained sitting on the bottom of the tub and after a couple minutes, she drew her knees up and hugging them close to her chest, she closed her eyes and began to cry, a feeling of unfairness overwhelming her.<br />
<br />
How long she stayed there, April was not totally sure, only that it was enough time for her to dry and sort out her thoughts, knowing that she had to tell somebody and that she needed a fresh view on the subject. &quot;But who?&quot; she asked herself as she climbed out of the tub and stood naked in the bathroom, hugging herself, afraid what anyone would say if she did confide in them.<br />
<br />
A pressure on her bladder distracted her from her thoughts and heading for the toilet, she attempted to sit down to pee, but in the end found it too uncomfortable and resorted to instead before the porcelain object and spraying urine all over the bowel, lid, seat and her hands, wondering how boys where even able to manage using such a ridiculous organ. Afterward, she stood at the sink and scrubbed her hands, lost in thought, wondering who she should tell, finally figuring that she might be able to confide in either Bets or Diane, but was unsure how Chastity would react.<br />
<br />
Exiting the bathroom, standing naked and not bothered by such a fact, she blinked in the darkness of the house, breathing deeply the scents of the empty house and realised that what she wanted was something to eat, but unsure how she was to catch a rabbit or chicken or something else that would settle her sudden craving for raw meat.<br />
<br />
As she shuddered at what she thought were disgusting thoughts, she heard somewhere in the house the phone ring and figuring that the answering machine would pick it up, she turned and headed for her room. Inside, she closed the door and taking a deep breath, she looked down at the horror she had grown, wished that she could just have her normal genitals back and telling herself angrily, &quot;Yeah, well, you can't,&quot; she glanced at the computer, noted that it had turned itself off and instead turned her attention to finding something to wear, deciding that no matter how comfortable it might be to go naked, she need clothes.<br />
<br />
An hour and a half later, she stared at the pile of clothes on her bed, trying to figure out what was going on. The first thing she could not wrap her mind about was that she had apparently shrunk and searching for the clothe tape measure she often kept if she needed to measure either herself or some article of clothe she planned to use to make an outfit, she located it and standing next to the door to her room, April measure herself a couple times, each time coming to the conclusion that she now stood four foot six as opposed to her normal height of five foot four. Tossing the tape measure aside, she grumbled in irritation and turned her attention back to the clothes.<br />
<br />
The second she had figured out was that no matter which pair of underwear she wore, none were anywhere near comfortable as they used to be. &quot;Mostly because of the hideous growth,&quot; April thought waspishly.<br />
<br />
And this fact also went for her bras, which not only were no longer comfortable, not that they were overly comfortable to begin with, but now they hurt her back even more and were clearly at least a cup and band size to big. This also went for her clothes, which the more she tried on, the more she discovered that they either did not fit and, in the case of her jeans, simply were not comfortable to wear.<br />
<br />
Gazing down, she noted that the fur seemed to be spreading and now her it was beginning to look like she was wearing a pair of fuzzy read boxers, with a white V section in the front. Hugging herself, suddenly glad that with the fur spreading it was harder to see the her neo-penis and shaft, but was disgusted that her testicles, which were also covered in fur, could still be clearly seen, no matter how close to her body they rested. Huffing in disgust, which sounded to her ears more like a sort of quasi-bark, she reached for a simple dress, figure that it would have to do and shrugging it on, she turned away from her bed and started across the room, but stopped before her mirror.<br />
<br />
As she peered into the reflective object, taking in how her clothes were hanging over her shrunken frame, she thought about what she had caught out of the corner of her eye and pacing back and forth, April soon realised that the way she held herself and the way she walked was different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost like the way my father and brother hold themselves and walk,&quot; she thought as she smooth the front of her dress down, hating the way it bulged out sometimes, clearly showing what she had in front instead of between her legs and uttering another bark-like huffing noise, she turned away from the mirror, walked across her room and clicked off the light, finding the darkness for some reason more comfortable then the lighted room.<br />
<br />
Exiting her room, she listened to the dark house, suddenly tense and alert, sniffing at the air and when she did not find anything out of the norm, she relaxed a little and began to make her way to the kitchen, where she was sure that she could find food. <br />
<br />
Inside the kitchen, she did not bother turning on the light and glancing at the machine, seeing the blinking number, she heading for the answering machine, noting that the microwave said that it was about six fifteen.<br />
<br />
Hitting the play button, she turned away as the machine explained the time and date and it was about to play message one of one and as the terrified voice of one of friends announced their message, April focused her attention on the fridge instead, sure that food lay inside, barely listening to the quavering voice on the machine as she opened the fridge and without giving it a second thought, began to eat the raw hamburger stored within.</p>
