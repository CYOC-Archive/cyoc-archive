<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He thinks about his own mother more. His mother&#39;s name is Emma, now recently 35 years old. His mother&#39;s height is around 5&#39; 7 almost hitting a mire 5’ 8, and him assuming is around 110s in weight. She is a blonde, with a cute pony tail hanging, and assuming to him again, has the breast size of around a C or higher. She has a slim body, somewhat toned, included with a nice hour-glass figure. She does work out once in a while doing yoga and all. She is currently at work, she works at a hospital as a nurse. His mother told him that the reason why, she wanted to become a nurse is because of losing someone that was once close to her. That someone was her sister that died at 14, her sister died when his mother was around Jeff&#39;s age at the time. She hates the thought of loosing someone near and dear to them. She feels that she wants help the others, preventing other&#39;s on what she has been through. His mother&#39;s is such an innocent angel, he really loves his mom&#39;s whole personality.<br />
<br />
He always wonder&#39;s what a female’s excrement looks like, also that of becoming it, and think’s the perfect canidate is his own mother. His mother&#39;s always includes all sorts of healthy foods in the family&#39;s daily diet. His mother always reminds the whole family by which eating lots of healthy food’s like greens for example, improves cardiac functions like balancing weight, improving organic functions, and more. However, the most import function is that it would provide better bowel movements. Remembering her criticism on him refusing to eat the healthy foods was enough for Jeff to wonder how his mother’s body handled that food. With this machine in his possession, he has the power to get an inside first-person view on how her body is currently doing in her bowels, and while also getting a ride of his mother’s daily life. He always think&#39;s about her slim figure, wondering what it&#39;s like being trapped and pleasured by her unknowingly inside that tight slim figure. He&#39;s was always curious about her mother, wanting to know her more from the inside.<br />
<br />
He decided, &quot;Screw it!&quot; he said to himself, as he select his mom on becoming her fecal matter. He adjust one of the parameters, setting all his senses to all with the exception of making himself be able to talk because he doesn’t want any sense of suspicions, he want’s other’s to be completely unaware on where he is and is afraid and embarrassed if his mother ever finds out about this she will probably never look at him the same ever again. <br />
<br />
His reality change stays unchanged, leaves the structure of his form to it’s default setting, and sets his mobility to off, again he doesn’t want any suspicions. Knowing that he will have access to the Chronivac if there is no time limit on his form, he thought it would be a good idea to set the time limit to &#39;Infinity&#39;, and then setting the other duration on how long he will be kept in her bowels before being shitted out on, he set it to ‘Random, depends on the body’. He then clicked &quot;Start Transformation!&quot; Jeff was getting soo excited, as the machine was starting to process.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seemed to be happening. But after a minute, Jeff felt a weird tickling sensation all over him, then it start’s to turn into a stinging sensation all around him, like his whole body is submerged into acid. It’s hurting him like crazy, he starts to moan out in pain a little as it’s happening. He immediately strips down to his nude self, to observe his own changes. While done stripping he notices that he is starting to accend, floating above his bedroom floor. While in the air he starts to reilize that the stinging sensation is starting to become more appearent, his skin is starting to becoming more red. Then he start’s to feel his whole body getting soft, becoming more malleable. He then start’s to feel his whole body fold on it’s self, it strangly doesn’t hurt. His body is starting to mix it’s self together into a human skinned piece of gum. Jeff doesn’t look human anymore but his changes aren’t finished. Jeff can’t see what’s going on, but he can imagine it through his own sense of feel. Then his whole body start’s to become more moist, more slimy. His malleable blobby body that’s still floating in the air, is starting to mold into a turd like structure. His whole body is now done being shapped like any ordinary turd. Then Jeff is starting to feel another senation that is happening to him. He feels himself becoming more weaker. His whole body is starting to change it’s skin color to a more darkish brown color, desolving his organs, skin, etc. to become fecal. Once that step was done from human to feces is done, he is now completely is own mother’s feces, but at the size of his whole body, but the machine will fix that. He starts to shrink down size, making his new form the right size to fit inside his mother’s bowels. Once his resize was finished, all his senses at starting to come back to him. He has all of his senses except one, he can feel/touch, he can smell and taste through his new form. Now with his hole vision, in which he is starting to gain, he can now see at all angles, a 360 degree view of all of his surroundings. But he can&#39;t talk nor move by his expectation.<br />
<br />
The machine now fully done transforming Jeff into his mother’s own feces. Jeff is just floating as a turd in the middle room, while the machine starts to process his teleportation. Jeff start&#39;s to look around his surroundings. ‘The world at his size seems huge!’ He thought to himself as he start&#39;s to feel himself disappearing. When he fully disappeared, Jeff starts to feel himself being transported somewhere, at a speed so fast he couldn’t see what’s happening, it’s unreal. Then everything stopped...<br />
<br />
Jeff has arrived in his mother’s large intestine. It is soft, wet, and slippery, the walls tightly encompassing him giving him a full on massaging session all around him, in which it’s turning him on at an extreme level. The atmoshereice environment, heavy, like a hot spring, a scorching and muggy hot spring. Concluding with an alluring but revolting smell. He tried to look around with his 360 degree view, but he still can’t really see anything being that it is pitch-black, there is no light where he is currently at. Jeff was surprised that the Chronivac worked, he chouldn’t believe that his whole body was indirectly digested by his own mother, and is still alive while at it. Looking around in his surrounding narrow view, he sees a struture that’s in front of him. Being that his view pitch-black with a relatively damp atmosphere it’s hard to tell what it is. <br />
<br />
He then recalled something, he can access the Chronivac at will anytime he wants to. But the question is is how he will pull it up. When he starts to think about pulling the Chronivac options up, an options list pulled up from the inside of his mind. He was astonished that it actually worked! He start’s to go through the more options tab, and eventually found an option to enable night vision. He turned on the option and exited the Chronivac menu. His vision has instantly become a lot lighter, making him be able to see in the dark. He can finally make out on what’s in front of him, is a huge log of his mother’s shit. His mother&#39;s past meal she has had which is currently finished being digested by his beautiful mother, his mother has fully taken the identity on what’s in front of him. What she did to her meal is also what she unknowingly did to him, her own son, reduced him as her waste akin to what’s above him. He can see every detail of it, looks kinda different compared to any other turd.<br />
<br />
He heard a loud rumble deep in the depths his gargantuan world, he then felt the intestinal walls press and rub against him hard. Which bend his fecal form out of shape a little bit but didn’t hurt him one bit, while that her body is compressing his form instantaneously, her body is trying to mold and combine his body onto the turd that above him. Her body using his fecal form as extra structure her typical load that’s above. Him being on her past meal that is reduced as her poop, he start’s to taste, feel and smell his mother’s poop. It very bitter, at the same time very sour and sweet, he thought that maybe his mother recently ate something that was very sweet, it’s kinda interesting and is starting to turn him on even more. Feel’s like putty coated in saliva, or wet slimy sand, and the smell, smells like any other shit. Behind his right side feels like a extremely small sphincter, which to him looking at it, doesn’t really like like a opening which leads to the outside. That is when he feel’s something pushing him and compressing him more from behind. Behind him feel’s kinda liquidy but at the same time not soo much, he sees that the liquid looks kinda light brownish. Jeff then realized where he is currently at in his mother’s large intestine. He is trapped around in her accending colon area. The liquid he is currently looking at behind him, is her recent meal that’s currently done with it’s journey through the small intestines.<br />
<br />
Jeff recalled that his mother is probably still at work. Jeff hear’s some faint murmurs beyond from the outside of his world. What is Jeff&#39;s mom currently doing?</p>
