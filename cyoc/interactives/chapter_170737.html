<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike found herself a step behind Mary as she trudged down the hotel corridor on their way to the tennis courts. She watched Mary&#39;s short skirt bounce up and down with every step and Mary&#39;s pony tail swinging from side to side as if it was a metronome. She was aware that her ponytail was swinging as well and no doubt the skirt was bouncing. She tried to walk more slowly in a vain attempt to stop the bouncing skirt. That only made her more aware of the bounce of her boobs.<br />
<br />
The only difference in their outfits was that Mike was wearing white sandals over bare feet, whereas Mary was wearing white sand-shoes and  bobby socks. That meant Mary was silent but Mike was giving off a &quot;Clip Clop&quot; sound as she walked on the tiled floor.<br />
<br />
They passed two female cleaners who barely gave the two cheerleaders a glance but to Mikes horror as they rounded a corner, two teenage boys in only board shorts were walking towards them, seemingly returning from a swim. Mike felt herself being checked out before one of the boys said &#39;Looking good girls&#39; then began a fake chant &#39;Give us an R, Give us an O, Give us a O, Give us a T. Ra Ra Ra&#39; Thrusting his pelvis as he did so. His mate just laughed.<br />
<br />
Mary ignored them and walked straight past but Mike felt like she was turning purple with embarrassment as she sped up her steps to catch up to Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary muttered to her &#39;Do boys ever grow up?&#39; Mike didn&#39;t even try to answer.<br />
<br />
Mary must have known where the tennis courts were as in no time they were there. They were apparently the last to arrive. Mrs Maloney appeared to be addressing a group of parents while Mike counted 4 girls all wearing the same uniform she was in and two boys in green shorts and a mostly white shirt. The teenagers appeared to be talking amongst themselves and all looked up when Mary and Mike approached. The two boys seemed to have huge muscles.<br />
<br />
Before anyone could say anything Mrs Maloney clapped her hands to get everybody&#39;s attention. &#39;Right, now we are all here I can end the speculation. As you have noticed. We have a new team member Michelle - Mary&#39;s twin sister. We should all be very thankful for Michelle for helping us out. She will replace Katelin who snapped her forearm last night and has returned home this morning. Without Michelle stepping up we would have had to forfeit. So how about a round of applause for Michelle to welcome her to the team&#39;<br />
<br />
Everyone clapped Mike.<br />
<br />
&#39;Now I gather Michelle has no experience with cheer-leading but as Mary&#39;s twin I suspect she has a lot of untapped potential. This needs to be a team effort. We all need to get Michelle up to speed before the competition starts. She will be taking over the number 6 girl position and Mina will be stepping up to the number 5 spot. A blonde girl developed a smile on her face. She was one of the girls who had been at breakfast &#39;Mina you have practised all of Katelin&#39;s moves and I have every confidence you will be able to perform her role&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Michelle&#39; Mrs Maloney was addressing Mike &#39;I see you couldn&#39;t find any sandshoes?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Mum has gone to buy some. She&#39;s not returned yet&#39; said Mary on Mike&#39;s behalf.<br />
<br />
&#39;Very well. We&#39;ll start anyway. Okay team. Let&#39;s show Michelle our battle cry. Michelle you watch Mina. You will be trying to emulate her moves&#39; <br />
<br />
For the next 15 minutes they worked on the battle cry. Mike tried to copy what Mina was doing and with the help of Mrs Maloney quickly learned the poses she was supposed to do. Mike found her new body remarkably flexible and had no trouble what-so-ever holding those poses. Mrs Maloney or &quot;Coach&quot; as the other students addressed her quietly said to Michelle &#39;You&#39;re a natural&#39;<br />
<br />
Sharon returned with her purchases and presented Mike with her own pair of bobby socks and a new pair of white sandshoes. They fitted her perfectly. She also gave Mike a pair of what she described as &#39;Cheer-leading knickers&#39; They were white and designed to be worn over her other panties. She had Mike put them on straight away. Sharon then told Mike. &#39;I bought some other things for you as well. They are back in the room. I&#39;ll show you later&#39;<br />
<br />
Back with the rest of the team Mike spent the next half hour learning two more routines before Coach dismissed them and told them to catch your breath and freshen up. Mike&#39;s role seemed to be not all that hard. Mostly she was expected to just hold poses and smile. Mary and one of the other girls, a brunette called Tansy, had a much harder role. They were the girls who Tom and Alistair threw around. They had to do handstands and somersaults. Now she understood why Mary wore &quot;Cheerleading Knickers&quot;<br />
<br />
Freshen up meant rushing back to the room, a splash of water on her face and Mum applying deodorant copiously on Mike before redoing the make-up. Evidently there was no time for a shower. Mike was surprised when Mary complimented her and saying &#39;You did great down there. Way to go sis&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike had spied a pile of shopping bags on the table in the unit, evidently some of the other things Sharon had purchased. However Sharon made no attempt to enlighten her about the contents. <br />
<br />
They were in a rush by now and had not any chance to eat lunch. That didn&#39;t phase either Mary or Sharon. Evidently Mary preferred to perform on an empty stomach. Mike wasn&#39;t too worried. She was still digesting the huge breakfast she had eaten.<br />
<br />
They got back into the car and Sharon drove a short distance to the stadium where the regional cheer-leading championships were being held.</p>
