<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You ever have one of those days where you wake up and you can't tell <br />
if you're still dreaming or not? You open your eyes, and look around <br />
your room, and everything just seems so surreal, you could swear you <br />
were still asleep in your bed. Then, you go about your day like <br />
normal, and everything's just the same as it always has been, and that <br />
feeling goes away after maybe five minutes or so. No big. The line <br />
between reality and dream is made clear, and you realize you're wide <br />
awake, and everything's peachy.<br />
<br />
...But ever since THAT day, that line's never been clear. Not even <br />
close.&quot; ~ Caleb &quot;Cale&quot; Walker, on the recent worldwide incident.<br />
____________________________<br />
<br />
Cale's eyes opened to the sight of his white dorm room ceiling, for <br />
the hundredth time, just like every other day. The light of day shone <br />
through his window and lit up the room. And, just like every other <br />
day, the thing that had woken him up was his damned alarm clock that <br />
never seemed to work right, and either woke him up an hour too late, <br />
or an hour too early. Turning over onto his side though, Cale could <br />
see from the time displayed, that it had done the later. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, so much for class.&quot; He groaned as he sat up, his eyes only half <br />
open.<br />
<br />
Looking at Cale on the street just at a glance, one wouldn't think <br />
anything special about him. That was because there wasn't anything <br />
special to see. Just another 5'11&quot; brown-eyed college student with a <br />
thing for not combing his short brown hair and going to his first <br />
class in the morning in his pajamas. Then again, who didn't do those <br />
things in college? That was the norm.<br />
<br />
Cale rubbed his eyes and reached over to his bed-side desk for his <br />
phone. The screen blared the message '3 Unread Texts' and Cale already <br />
knew exactly who it was texting so early in the morning. Opening the <br />
text messages, his guess was confirmed. Crystal, his girlfriend, <br />
texting him &quot;Good morning&quot; at 8:05, &quot;Are U up yet?&quot; at 8:30, and &quot;Hey, <br />
where R U?&quot; at 8:55. Cale puzzled for a second on how he hadn't heard <br />
his phone go off, before pressing the volume button on the side and <br />
learning that he'd had it on vibrate for some reason. Cale face-palmed <br />
on the inside, before dropping the phone on the floor, and laying back <br />
in bed to stare at the ceiling. <br />
<br />
He couldn't tell what it was exactly, but something about the day <br />
seemed weird. It was a surreal feeling, like he wasn't sure he was <br />
even awake yet. Maybe this was all a dream. Cale didn't think anything <br />
of it though. He'd felt that way in the morning before, as had <br />
everyone else he was sure. The feeling would be gone soon. <br />
<br />
As he laid there in bed, Cale let his eyes droop a bit. In his head, <br />
he could hear a slight grumbling that seemed strangely calming. It <br />
grew a little louder, and suddenly, Cale noticed that his bed seemed <br />
to be shaking slightly. His eyes opened at the realization that the <br />
grumbling wasn't in his head, and he sat up in bed, with a look of <br />
confusion on his face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the room jerked quickly, and the next thing he knew, his <br />
second-floor room was at a slant, and his bed, along with every other <br />
piece of furniture in the room, began to slide across the tile floor <br />
toward the opposite wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa whoa whoa whoa WHOA!&quot; Cale exclaimed as he slid with the bed, <br />
almost falling out as it hit the far wall. <br />
<br />
Outside, he could suddenly hear screams and sirens. The foundation of <br />
the building creaked everywhere, and Cale jumped out of bed as fast as <br />
he could, before quickly gathering his phone, keys, and wallet, and <br />
heading out the door.<br />
<br />
The hallways were in a panic, and Cale was swept with the crowd toward <br />
the stairway and to the first floor. Bodies moved all around him, <br />
shoving him against just about every fixture between the stairwell and <br />
the exit, before finally, he'd made it out the door, and into the <br />
parking lot of the building, where an even larger crowd had gathered <br />
at the foot of the building. Cale made it through the mob, and to the <br />
far side of the parking lot, before he turned around to see what <br />
exactly had happened to the building.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the whole building was slanted on it's side somewhat, and <br />
a large crevice could easily be seen in the ground leading to it from <br />
somewhere down the street. On one side of it, the ground had lifted a <br />
good six feet, so even with the crowd around it, it wasn't hard to <br />
spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, this is bad-ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? There was just a freaking earthquake! That's BAD, <br />
dumbass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, bad or not, this shit's going on Youtube. Get your camera out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I hope no one was hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cale listened to the conversations around him from various students, <br />
but didn't pay much attention to them. His head was still spinning. <br />
This all just had to be a dream. He was sure of it!<br />
<br />
The sirens off in the distance seemed to grow louder, and soon, police <br />
vehicles began to make their way into the parking lot. A loudspeaker <br />
from one blared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attention. An immediate evacuation of the South side of town is now <br />
in effect. Please make your way to the North side of campus, where an <br />
emergency evacuation bus will take you out of the area. I repeat: An <br />
immediate evacuation...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Evacuation? Are they serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So much for my Youtube hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get a few pictures or something with your phone and get over it, <br />
superstar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cale stood with his mouth slightly ajar still focused on the building <br />
and the crevice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... the hell?&quot; He muttered to himself, before stepping backward <br />
as a portion of the crowd began to file past him. He turned and <br />
followed, absorbed in his thoughts. The crowd grew thicker as groups <br />
from other parts of campus joined en route to the North side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, I can't believe there was an earthquake HERE of all places. I <br />
didn't know we were anywhere near a fault line.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not. Didn't you have the news on? This is like the twentieth <br />
earthquake like this just today! Apparently, they're happening <br />
everywhere worldwide!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? Man, that's insane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cale stopped short. &quot;This is happening... worldwide?&quot; He asked to no <br />
one in particular. He jumped a bit when he got an answer from behind <br />
as someone suddenly wrapped their arms around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! This is going on everywhere!&quot; A light, female voice chimed. <br />
<br />
Cale spun around and found himself looking at a young woman, maybe <br />
half a foot shorter than him, with wavy black hair down to just past <br />
her shoulders. Her complexion and hair color told Cale right off the <br />
bat that she was of Hispanic heritage. She wore a light blue sweater <br />
and jeans, with a white undershirt. He'd never seen her before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... do I know you?&quot; Cale asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Not in the slightest! But I know all about you, Caleb Walker, <br />
age 20, height five-foot-eleven, weight 167 pounds, blood type AB <br />
positive, and shoe size 12 mens.&quot; She said as she poked Cale in the <br />
chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha... how...&quot; Cale was at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's just a sample of what all I know about you. If you'll come <br />
with me now, I'd really appreciate it. We really need to hurry though, <br />
since this is the last location that stage 1 is supposed to take place <br />
at, and I want to at least get to talk to you a bit before stage 2 <br />
happens and you may not be able to speak English anymore.&quot; The girl <br />
said, before grabbing Cale's wrist and pulling him out of the crowd to <br />
a solitary tree nearby.<br />
<br />
Cale pulled his arm away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, hold on for a sec! WHAT?!?! What the hell are you talking <br />
about???&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing. Just the end of the world as you know it.&quot; The girl said <br />
lightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, my name's Ani. That's A-N-I, got it?&quot; Ani beamed as she <br />
emphasized the spelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, on to the subject at hand: You. In a short bit, you're gonna <br />
feel a bit funny, and things are gonna get a bit weird, but trust me, <br />
you'll be fine when you come out of it.&quot;</p>
