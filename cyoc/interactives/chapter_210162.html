<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mandy was the first to wake on Sunday morning. Perhaps it was because she was in an unfamiliar body and an unfamiliar room. Perhaps also it was because she once more had an erection, despite the fact that he had masturbated to climax, once he had taken to Paul’s bed. For whatever reason he woke early and after a brief moment of confusion remembered the proceedings of the previous day.<br />
<br />
He wandered to the lounge to find Paul still asleep on her recliner. Paul’s head was at a curious angle which made Mandy’s body not look very elegant. As Paul was still sound asleep, Mandy was able peruse her body closely. She had a pretty face but perhaps she wasn&#39;t as curvy as men desired. She had read on the internet how the medallion of Zulo could be used to enhance body parts. Mandy imagined her body with bigger breasts. Those B cup breasts currently on his son seemed too small. Paul&#39;s hairstyle also seemed a bit outdated. Mandy recalled the curls sported by a blonde girl at last nights party. He wondered how that hairdo would look on his own head?<br />
<br />
He wondered how on earth this woman was comfortable enough to sleep? Then noticed the empty wine bottle was a red, not the half empty white that had been in the fridge. It was a bottle of red that had been a gift from one of his adult students. He was annoyed. He subsequently found the empty bottle of white on the kitchen bench.<br />
<br />
It seemed Paul had finished the 1st bottle then opened the red. She would wake with an awful hangover. <br />
<br />
Mandy’s original thought had been to immediately swap back but now he decided that firstly he did not want to share Paul’s hangover and that secondly leaving her to wake up as she was could teach her a valuable lesson. <br />
<br />
Instead he tidied up the mess that Paul had created. It took the turning on of the vacuum cleaner to wake Paul from her slumber. Her initial reaction to waking up with a massive headache and finding herself in the wrong body was actually amusing to watch. It was perhaps only Mandy’s fear that Paul might vomit on the silk dress she was wearing, that prompted Mandy to help the woman undress and put her in a luke-warm shower. With annoyance Mandy noticed a red wine stain on the dress. He left Paul in the shower and consulted his stain removal book on how to treat the stain.  <br />
<br />
After attending to the stain Mandy returned to the shower to find Paul sitting on the floor still under the running water and moaning about her headache.<br />
<br />
Eventually Mandy decided that enough was enough. He retrieved the medallion and carefully touched it to the dress he had been wearing before changing to Paul’s body the previous day. Once he was assured that the change was proceeding he removed Paul from the shower took her to Paul’s room and touched the medallion and to the pyjama top that she had just removed. The naked Paul had not stopped moaning the whole time.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later both Mandy and Paul were back in their own bodies and both stone cold sober.<br />
<br />
After chastising Paul about over indulgence, Mandy let him know about his arranged date with Melissa and everything that had happened at the party. She went into every detail she could remember. <br />
<br />
Mandy actually found that she was as excited about Paul’s upcoming date as he was.<br />
<br />
They decided to go shopping so Paul would have something appropriately trendy to wear on his date. Mandy certainly didn&#39;t trust Paul to do this on his own. At the local shopping centre Mandy helped Paul select new shoes, trousers and several shirts. She left Paul with money to pay for his purchases and slipped into a lingerie store herself. There she found a bra of her size but with C cups. She made sure that the bra had not previously been worn. She had read what would happen if someone else had previously worn the item.<br />
<br />
Paul had a similar idea. While driving to the shops his Mum had spoken about her idea of increasing her breast size. Perhaps he could do the same, not to give himself breasts, he wasn&#39;t that way inclined, but to enhance his muscles. If he bought a larger sized shirt could he give himself bigger muscles? It was worth a try. He replaced one of the &#39;S&#39; shirts in his hand with the identical shirt in an &#39;L&#39; before taking it to the counter.<br />
<br />
Later that afternoon Mandy successfully used her new bra and the medallion to increases her breast size from B to C. She likes it. Her only problem is that now she will need to update much of her wardrobe.</p>
