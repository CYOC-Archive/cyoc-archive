<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back to the present.<br />
<br />
Presently, you are staring out of the large, dark eyes of your brain&#39;s new home. Unaware of the future horrors you shall experience with your prison of a new body. <br />
<br />
You&#39;ve just been told by....well....by yourself....what happened and why. Surely, that donkey that is walking away with your human body he now possesses, could not be so cruel as to not come.back and switch places again? Afterall, you have a human mind. He wouldn&#39;t have one if you were to switch back. <br />
<br />
But the donkey&#39;s newly-acquired human mind wasn&#39;t so cruel as all that. It was just. That. Well. He wouldn&#39;t want to be a donkey. At all. Afterall, what human would ACTUALLY want to be a donkey? The very thought made him shudder and sickened him. He could smell what he used to smell like. Which was very unappealing. He could see the nasty green slime between his formerly enormous blockey nuclear-yellow teeth with black around the outlines of them as they were in the process of decaying. And that donkey-breath smell! Ppphheeewww! Talk about the most intense halitosis! Smelled like dead, rotting fish! To forever be stuck with such a mouth made him gag. And hooves instead of hands. With piss-soaked muddy manure caked all inside the u-shaped hoof of the underside. With large, biting flies constantly landind on your eyeballs and up your slimy snout. Stinging you, and making you itch all over. Totally incapable of scratching those itches without much difficulty. The only you have from such misery and torture, is a tail. And that tail is of limited length. It only reaches so far up your sides and back to flick away those oests. Which only return to the exact same spot in 2.1 seconds flat anyway. But at least it keeps the flies off your huge, black anus and hose-like black-as-midnight penis. But Everytime that tail flick, your black donkey anus would be exposed for the world to see. Besides the fact that the thought of having a tail to begin with, was humiliating and degrading. No thank you!<br />
<br />
But you are. YOU are stuck all of those features. With the added bonus of being incapable of ever expressing anything on your mind outloud in any sort of understandable fashion.<br />
<br />
And so, the donkey turned around and walked away. While your mind tries to beg the donkey to stay. To come back. But all you do is scream: &quot;hhheee hhaaww hhheeee hhhaawww!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
To the donkey, your terrified screechy braying fades as he walks further and further away from his old life, and closer and closer to his new life. To your life. You are never to be seen again by that donkey, as he moves to Hawaii like you were in the middle of planning to, and vacations in such places as Rome and Tokyo. <br />
<br />
You&#39;re the one that put in all of those years of hard work and effort in order to one day live in paradise. On the verge of achieving that goal, you instead find yourself living in a hellish nightmare. <br />
<br />
You are exposed to the outside elements 24/7, with a drafty old barn as your only form of shelter, while you&#39;re forced to sleep while standing up.<br />
<br />
He gets to live in a beoutiful home in paradise, and sleep in silk and satin covers lying down on a proper bed.<br />
<br />
You quickly discover you have no say over your body when it&#39;s hungry or horny. Like right now as your braying is forced to stop while your head forcefully bends down for the first time much to your horror and dismay. Your large donkey jaw opens wide and tears &quot;another&quot; time. The donkey was in the middle of feeding when you switched. To your human mind, it tastes like nasty old grass, when to an actual donkey, its supposed to be sweet and delicious. The very first time your head bent down out of instinct, was very disorienting. Your mind was yelling out:<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no! Wtf? Stop! Stop, you stupid donkey! I don&#39;t want to eat!&quot; Just as you are forced to tear your very first mouthful of grass from the ground. You just stupidly stand there on all fours with your gray furry boxy body chewing; wasting valuable time chewing on a clump of grass being mashed between your disgusting teeth. <br />
<br />
Then to your horror, your eyesight is lowering again. And again, your snout is pressing into the grass! And again, you come away with another mouthful of grass while you just stand there like some dumb mindless beast chewing and swallowing grass. <br />
<br />
Your head dips for the third time. You feel something bite your right rear rump, and feel your donkey tail automatically flick outward.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the donkey in your body is walking home and will be greeted with a kiss and a hug from your fiancee. He would be drawing hot water for a nice clean refreshing shower, and getting changed into your clothes in your shared bedroom. He would be putting your wallet and your keys in your pockets. Then him and your fiancee would be walking put to your car, and driving to a fancy restaurant for your anniversary, where he will propose to marry him, and they would enjoy an expensive scrumptious lobster dinner with fine wine. Then going to amovie you wanted real badly to see. <br />
<br />
All this time, you&#39;re stuck as a mindless draft animal, being forced to eat like one completely against your will. You felt the time ticking away, thinking about your fiancee at home. How much you wanted to be with her and hang out with her. You had planned this special night months in advance! Your heart would be racing from knowing this night will forever be lost to you at this rate. <br />
<br />
Your head dips down for more disgusting grass for about the twelfth time. Each time, you keep thinking &quot;no, no, no! Not again! I shouldn&#39;t be eating like this! I need to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
But continue eating, you do anyway. You graze for several hours. Each time your head dips for more, you yell out in your mind to &quot;stop!&quot; You beg and plead, but to no avail. You are doing exactly as that donkey with your body should be doing instead. <br />
<br />
Finally, your head stops bending down. You find you have control again. You notice you&#39;re in the presence of another human. You attempt to say &quot;help me! I need help! Call the police!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, you are greeted with this:<br />
<br />
&quot;hhheeee Hhhaaww hhheeee hhaaww hhheeee hhaawww&quot; escaping from your thick, black lips. <br />
<br />
You attempt to say &quot;dammit!&quot; You let out the sound &quot;HHHHAAAWWWW&quot; as you slam your right front hoof on the ground. <br />
<br />
The person looks at you for moment, but ignores your desparate pleas. But youre just another donkey to him, far past your prime. <br />
<br />
You look around behind you, and see your large gray donkey body extending behind your neck. All you see, is your right flank. Your tail flicks into view quickly a couple of times.<br />
<br />
You look down at your front legs and hooves. Totally useless, but to just carry your own weight. <br />
<br />
You look down between your legs, and see your white-furred dirty, muddy underbelly, and your massive black cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hhaawwiing&quot; several more times for good measure, you look to your left down your left side. Yup. Your nothing but a donkey. <br />
<br />
You sadly dip your head as all four of your legs lock into position. You let out a couple of whimpering brays, and fall asleep. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the donkey turns off your light, snuggles up with your fiancee, and uses your human cock to create another little human. You are completely forgotten by him, and totally out of his mind. Afterall, why would an important human like that donkey remember a single, brief encounter with a random, dirty, smelly old donkey?</p>
