<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay. I love the parts about me and you getting married and living happily ever after,&quot; began Nate Anderson, while sitting next to his boyfriend Alex Ramsey.<br />
After going back into their tent before dawn to avoid being werewolves in the daylight, the two expressed more passionate love with each other before falling asleep together.<br />
Now they were up and about, not caring about the fact that it was almost noon, having a late breakfast as two ordinary teenage boys sitting near the fire pit of their campsite at the shores of Moon Lake itself.<br />
&quot;But at some point we adopt a child?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s about the size of it,&quot; confirmed Alex. &quot;Someday the two of us become co-fathers to a child named Alice.&quot;<br />
&quot;But who is this girl? I barely remember the ending. My dream was more about consoling you and assuring you that nothing was going to go wrong, despite all the red tape and other hassles we had to overcome.&quot;<br />
&quot;Truthfully? Your guess is as good as mine,&quot; admitted Alex. &quot;She might be like Ben*, because I honestly doubt Moon Lake would let a were couple adopt a normal child unless there was no other option, but does it matter?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; conceded Nate, as he put his arm around his boyfriend. &quot;So, how does it feel to be a parent, dad?&quot;<br />
&quot;It does feel good,&quot; Alex said with a smile, &quot;but I think we&#39;ve still got quite a ways to go before we reach that point. After all, regardless of which graduation we get married after, we still have to get through both high school and college, because what I remember of the dream had us adopting Alice sometime after your first book&#39;s been published and I&#39;ve taken ownership of the local diner.&quot;<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to remember any of the details about that first book, would you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Afraid not. Would you happen to know who proposed to who?&quot; asked Alex, looking intently at Nate.<br />
Nate just took his boyfriend&#39;s hand in his and asked, &quot;Does it matter? Obviously the one questioned said yes, and when the time comes, I can&#39;t think of anyone else I&#39;d rather spend the rest of my life with,&quot; before leaning closer and kissing Alex.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
After they finished &quot;swimming&quot; in the pool, were-merman Eric Anderson and his fiance, the were-mermaid Julie Stovall held hands as they returned to the cabana in the Stovall family&#39;s backyard.<br />
Together, they enjoyed each other as only two people deeply in love could, before they fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms.<br />
Now Eric slowly started to awaken. At first he thought he was still underwater because all he could see was two vivid pools of blue, but then Eric blinked and realized that he was staring deeply into his lover&#39;s eyes.<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; he said with a smile, before kissing her.<br />
&quot;Not for much longer. It&#39;s almost noon,&quot; noted Julie, after glancing at the clock radio on the nightstand near the bed.<br />
&quot;Does it matter?&quot; asked Eric, as he put his arms around her. &quot;I&#39;m right were I want to be, with who I want to be with.&quot;<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; said Julie, while snuggling closer to him. &quot;Life is beautiful.&quot;<br />
&quot;And so are you,&quot; added Eric, before kissing her again.<br />
But whatever Julie was going to say next was lost when a squawking noise came from somewhere overhead.<br />
&quot;Are you kids up yet? I&#39;m about to fix brunch,&quot; said Melissa Stovall.<br />
&quot;HUH?&quot; said Eric, trying to scramble for the covers to hide his &quot;modesty&quot;.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the intercom, silly,&quot; said Julie, while reaching up to touch a control panel above their bed&#39;s headboard. &quot;We&#39;ve just got to pull ourselves together. See you in a few minutes,&quot;she said, before lowering her hand to tussle Eric&#39;s hair playfully. &quot;Silly boy,&quot; said Julie, before kissing him again. &quot;Even if mom was physically here, don&#39;t you remember there&#39;s no shame being nude among fellow weres?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Eric, starting to get up, &quot;but I&#39;m guessing we should get dressed for the day between brunch and wanting to take that walk together later,&quot; he added, while looking for his clothes.<br />
As Julie started to do the same, she asked, &quot;Listen, did you happen to...&quot;<br />
&quot;Dream about us again?&quot; Eric asked in return, while staring at her beautiful nude form.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Someday there will be me, you, our son Eric Junior, and our daughter Melinda all under the same roof**; one big happy family. But does it bother you that we never see anything beyond that?&quot; wondered Julie. &quot;In my most detailed dream, Junior can&#39;t be more than 7 and Melinda&#39;s a couple of years younger.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are we even supposed to see that, let alone be aware of as much as we are?&quot; asked Eric in return. &quot;I&#39;ve heard that there is a lot about Moon Lake that even the older weres are uncertain of, like these so called &#39;prophecy&#39; dreams some have.&quot;<br />
As he walked around the bed to be closer to her, Eric added, &quot;All I know about these dreams is that they led me to you,&quot; he said, while caressing the single pearl necklace around her neck that represented the were-mers idea of an engagement ring, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to be anywhere else in the entire universe but here with you my love,&quot; said Eric, as he wrapped his arms lovingly around Julie and began kissing her again.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Unbeknownst to the two teenagers, Julie had pressed the Intercom button too hard before making her reply, so the system was stuck open, sending everything from the cabana to the main house.<br />
In the kitchen, Melissa Stovall not only heard Julie&#39;s answer about brunch, but every word between her daughter and her intended afterward.<br />
<i>Eric Junior and Melinda?</i> she asked herself, feeling a bit flushed at the unintentional discovery. <i>Martin and I knew that Julie and Eric were destined soul mates after Julie said Eric&#39;s eyes were starting to change color***, but this?</i><br />
Then the kissing sounds started to grow louder, and Melissa realized Julie and her fiance might be a little late joining her for brunch...<br />

**During a wonderful dream the two of them shared WAY back in the episode &quot;Good Morning, My Love&quot;<br />
***The concepts of &quot;love at first sight&quot; and &quot;soul mates&quot; are proven scientific facts, at least to were-mers. After a were-mer first sees the one they feel love and hope they are destined to spend the rest of their life with, their intended&#39;s eyes will occasionally change color if true love does exist between them, even if the other is still a normal human being at the time.—tmw.</p>
