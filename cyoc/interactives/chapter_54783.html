<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up to someone knocking on your door. At first, you don't know where you <br />
are, but you quickly remember that you're in your room. That dream had seemed so <br />
real but you know that you aren't a grownup, and you're definitely not a boy. You look <br />
around your room just to confirm that you are you. Your room is that of a typical seven <br />
year old girl. You have a four poster bed with pink lace curtains, a pink and violet <br />
dresser, and a pink toy chest with &quot;Princess&quot; and your name written on it in violet <br />
letters. There are posters of Hannah Montana on the pink walls, and a walk-in closet <br />
which you know holds all of your pretty dresses and shoes.<br />
<br />
There is another knock on your door, and this time you hear your mommy say sweetly, <br />
&quot;Time to get up, Violet. Remember, we're going to the water park today, and Daddy <br />
wants to get going soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm up, Mommy,&quot; you say, and immediately think that your voice is different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready to go, then. Put on your swimsuit under your dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mommy.&quot; Once again you think that your voice is strange, but you know it's not. <br />
If it was, your mommy would have said something.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don't forget to brush your teeth, princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't, Mommy,&quot; you say, smiling at the pet name. You still think that your voice <br />
sounds strange, but you're still a little sleepy so it must be your imagination. That's <br />
what your mommy would say.<br />
<br />
You get out of bed. Most days you have to use the potty right away, but you don't feel <br />
the need today. You think maybe you're growing up! Mommy would be proud. Still, you <br />
go into the bathroom and brush your teeth, just like Mommy told you to. You know it <br />
makes her happy when you do what she tells you.<br />
<br />
You go back to your room and open the drawer that has your swimsuits in it. You're in <br />
a pink mood today, so you pick out a pink one-piece with a big red heart outlined in <br />
gold glitter. Next you go to your closet to pick out your dress. The one you pick is a <br />
pink short sleeve with ruffles on the hem and sleeves. You bend down to a shelf and <br />
pick up a pair of pink sandals, then you take all the items of clothing and place them <br />
on your bed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You take off your nightgown and then your Disney princess panties, but you stop when <br />
you see your private part. For some reason, you think that there should be something <br />
down there, but you can't think of what that would be. You simply have this feeling that <br />
it shouldn't be as flat as it is. You wonder where these feelings are coming from. You <br />
decide to ignore them and finish getting ready.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You put on your swimsuit, then your dress, and slip on your sandals. You pick up your <br />
nightgown and panties and throw them down the clothes chute on your way out of <br />
your bedroom.<br />
<br />
You go downstairs and see your daddy in the living room. He looks up briefly from his <br />
newspaper as you enter and says, &quot;Good morning, princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Daddy.&quot; you said. Then you decide to tell him about your dream. <br />
&quot;Daddy, I had a strange dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? What was it about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was-&quot; You stop as you feel a warm sensation around your private part. You <br />
look down, and your fears are confirmed. You're wetting yourself,&nbsp;something that you <br />
haven't done since before you turned seven a few days ago - no, longer than that, a <br />
deep part of you says. And you didn't even think you had to go! In panic, you press a <br />
hand against the stream to try to hold it in, but you only succeed in getting both your <br />
dress and your hand soaked.<br />
<br />
Your daddy is still engrossed in his newspaper, and hasn't seen anything. &quot;You were <br />
what, pumpkin?&quot;<br />
<br />
The stain on your pretty pink dress grows, and you feel your pee start to run down <br />
your legs and onto the tiled floor. Not knowing what to do, you start to cry. &quot;Daddy...&quot; <br />
you say in a small voice.<br />
<br />
He looks up from his paper and, noticing your predicament, jumps up. &quot;Oh honey, it's <br />
okay,&quot; he says soothingly as he bends down and gives you a hug, careful not to get <br />
your accident on him. &quot;Things like this happen sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand there sniffling as your pee starts to cool uncomfortably against your skin <br />
and in your sandals. Your daddy &nbsp;calls your mommy downstairs, and she comes and <br />
takes you by the hand, leading you back up to your bedroom and whispering <br />
reassurances all the way. You know that you are much too old to be having accidents, <br />
and you try to say sorry, but your mommy hushes you. &quot;It happens sometimes, honey, <br />
and it's not anybody's fault. Let's just get you cleaned up,&quot; she says, and you know <br />
that it happens, even to girls your age, but you can't help feeling a great deal of <br />
shame, like you're a much bigger person who did the same thing.<br />
<br />
She fetches a towel from your bathroom and has you stand on it. She removes your <br />
sandals and lifts your dress over your head, then carefully peels off your soaked one-<br />
piece. &quot;Did you go potty this morning?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
You shamefacedly shake your head 'no.' &quot;I didn't think I had to go at all,&quot; you say <br />
quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; your mommy says, &quot;how about we make a deal? Let's say that from now on, <br />
when you wake up in the morning, you go sit on the potty, even if you think you don't <br />
need to go. If you just try, I think we can avoid doing this again. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, even though you think it's a rule a toddler would have, and not a seven year <br />
old. Your mommy smiles, satisfied, then takes the wet clothes and the towel, and <br />
throws them down the laundry chute, then takes you into the bathroom to give you a <br />
quick bath. Baths are always fun, and you start to smile again as your mommy <br />
splashes you playfully.<br />
<br />
When the bath is done, your mommy dries you off with another towel, and hands you a <br />
new one-piece swimsuit and a dress to wear over it. Both are yellow, a color you <br />
would not have chosen for yourself, but you take them anyway and start to put on the <br />
swimsuit. Your mommy stops you.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's one more thing.&quot; She reaches under the bathroom cabinet and pulls out a <br />
package of your old Little Swimmers from when you were five or so and still having a <br />
few accidents. You're horrified. &quot;But Mommy-&quot;<br />
<br />
She puts a finger to your lips. &quot;I know. But it's just in case. You don't want another <br />
accident to stop you from having fun today, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to protest again, but she gives you the &quot;Mommy look,&quot; and you know you have <br />
to comply. She takes a diaper out of the package and hands it to you. You put it on, <br />
surprised that it still mostly fits after two whole years.<br />
<br />
Your mommy looks at you appraisingly, and digs in the package once more. She <br />
hands you another diaper. &quot;I don't think one would be enough if you have an accident. <br />
Try putting this one on over the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
You obey somewhat sullenly, and Mommy nods approvingly. You look down to see <br />
Ariel, the Little Mermaid, smiling serenely up at you, and you can't help but feel a little <br />
babyish. You put on your swimsuit, feeling an unusual stretch over the diapers. <br />
Curious, you&nbsp;climb your stepstool to the counter to see how you look in the mirror. The <br />
extra padding pushes your legs out and makes the climb a little awkward, requiring <br />
you to use your hands as well as feet (like a baby, you think) to get up the short steps. <br />
You can tell there's enough of a bulge around your middle to indicate you're wearing <br />
diapers, and you hope no one looks hard enough to notice. You see your mommy <br />
smiling slightly at you. The attention embarrasses you somewhat, and you briefly <br />
consider asking to stay home today, but the allure of the water park is too great, and <br />
you hop down off the stool to finish dressing.<br />
<br />
You and your mommy head back downstairs, you going first in anticipation of the day, <br />
the incident if the morning somewhat forgotten, though you still feel the extra bulk <br />
between your legs. She follows behind you, dressed in her bathing suit under normal <br />
clothing and carrying a few extra swim diapers to pack in the day bags waiting &nbsp;<br />
downstairs.<br />
<br />
Daddy is now dressed in his swimwear as well, and as you enter the living room he <br />
packs the last few items into day bags. He smiles as you run up to him and gives you <br />
a big hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sweetheart, are you feeling better?&quot; he asks. You nod and give him a smile back. <br />
&quot;That's the spirit,&quot; he says, kissing your forehead. His slight stubble tickles your face, <br />
making you giggle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to help me take these bags out to the car?&quot; You take a bag with your sunscreen <br />
and towel and a few other things, and a bag of snacks, and follow your daddy outside <br />
to the SUV your family had bought just a couple weeks before.<br />
<br />
As you help him put the bags in the trunk, he asks, &quot;So what were you going to tell me <br />
earlier about a dream you had?&quot;<br />
<br />
You've almost forgotten, and as it is, you have to think for a moment to remember <br />
anything coherent. &quot;I think... It was that I was like you, Daddy. I was big and a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your daddy chuckles and says &quot;That's certainly a strange dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it seemed real.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your daddy chuckles again and says &quot;I know that some dreams may seem real but <br />
they're not. Sometimes they can seem so real that you don't know where you are when <br />
you wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what happened to me. I think that my voice sounds strange and there's <br />
suppose to be something in my private area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must have been some dream. I'm going to tell you something that I haven't told <br />
anyone before. A couple years ago I had a dream where I was a little girl. It seemed <br />
so real to me that for the rest of the day I kept thinking that my voice had changed, <br />
that I shouldn't be so big, and that I should have a flat private area. There was even a <br />
few times that I caught myself almost going into the little girl's room. But, you know <br />
what? Those feelings went away that same day, and they will for you too, kiddo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still remember that dream, Daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, very clearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mommy comes out at that point, holding her cell phone, and says, &quot;I have some <br />
news for you, princess. Miley's going to be at the water park, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
You grin widely. &quot;No way! Really??&quot; She nods. &quot;Yay! Miley's going!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Violet, just remember that she's not going as Hannah Montana,&quot; your mommy <br />
says. &quot;She's going there to relax and have fun, not to perform for anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we should get going,&quot; your daddy says, opening the driver's door and getting <br />
into the car. &quot;We'll stop and get some breakfast on the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit in your booster seat and your mommy buckles you in. You know you need the <br />
booster seat since you are only three feet, ten inches tall, rather small for a seven year <br />
old. You are often mistaken for being much younger than you are, and you've been told <br />
that you will need to use the booster seat until you're about twelve. Normally, you don't <br />
give it any thought, but today you can't help but think that you shouldn't need it. Maybe <br />
that feeling will go away today, like your daddy said his did. Your daddy starts the car <br />
and you're on your way to the water park.</p>
