<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Olivia was always a lovely looking woman, and her current outfit proved it. The frilly uniform&#39;s skirt stopped after the knees that showed off her strong calves and dainty feet strapped into large heels. Her waist held tightly by the apron&#39;s tie accentuated her large ass. The white patterns of threaded design were in an oval around her c-cups&#39; cleavage. Her dark straight hair was tied in a bun, with just a few stray strands. One in particular she moved from her eyes to help her vision, and it showed a tired looking woman with minimal makeup and a forced smile.<br />
<br />
Of course, that was the only part Emily had taken notice of. That, of course, and just the blatant shock that came with seeing her mother in that kind of role. Sure, she was a stay at home mom usually, but she had an accounting job before she was born, so why did changing herself and Rick change things so drastically?<br />
<br />
As Olivia placed food in front of her, Emily was about to ask just about a thousand questions, but then she just stopped. What could she actually say to her? Hey it&#39;s me, your daughter if reality hadn&#39;t been changed, and you got to marry this guy before this woman did oh by the way she&#39;s actually my boyfriend? Like, she&#39;d sound insane! Before she could think of anything more reasonable to ask, she had moved on to placing Paul&#39;s food.<br />
<br />
&quot;We say &#39;Thank you miss Olivia&#39; after meals in this house, Em, don&#39;t we?&quot; Rebecca suddenly spoke up, causing her to jump in her seat slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh yes, my bad.&quot; She laughed uncomfortably. &quot;Thank you, Miss Olivia!&quot; Emily yelled out, perhaps too loudly, causing her &#39;mother&#39; to look at her oddly, but thankfully Olivia just chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you, Em, I appreciate the enthusiasm. Will that be all, Ms. Rebecca? Mr. Paul?&quot; She asked with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thank you, Olivia.&quot; Paul replied with a soft smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then enjoy your meal.&quot; She said softly before doing a slight curtsy and walking silently out of the room.<br />
<br />
The rest of the meal was a blur. Emily ate, but it was more like autopilot while her mind raced. She was trying to figure out how this was the outcome, but she couldn&#39;t think of anything. Her only distraction being Rebecca and Paul talking, which, did NOT help. All they did was make either boring small talk or lovey-dovey talk, which weirded her out.<br />
<br />
Finally, they had all finished and Olivia came out yet again after her father called for her. Effortlessly, she scooped up each dish in seconds before departing as fast as she arrived, further making Emily curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot; Rebecca interrupted the silence. &quot;I&#39;ve got a game to finish today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; Paul laughed aloud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry, is something funny.&quot; She sighed, rolling her eyes and placing both hands upon her wide hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just no of, uuuuh, ZERO, other of my friends wives who would say anything like that.&quot; Paul explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah.&quot; She smirked. &quot;I&#39;ve heard it all before, growing up. My father always joked with me that I should&#39;ve been a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily kept it to herself, having to stifle a chuckle, the thought of Rick growing up the same way Emily saw as she grew up, but as a short girl. The novelty of this whole situation, however, was starting to wain as she watched her boyfriend turned mother walk over to her actual father and just plop her fat ass on his lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily for you, I lost that tomboy streak in high school, and I&#39;m all woman now.&quot; She said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, most women don&#39;t play video games.&quot; He replied with a wider grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, most women don&#39;t have my competitive streak.&quot; She said with a fake pout. &quot;You know how I LOVE to win.&quot; She replied.<br />
<br />
Emily looked away, her face turning beet red as Rebecca just casually grabbed Paul&#39;s dick, though thankfully just on top of and not through his pants. Emily coughed, causing Rebecca to look up, surprised almost to see her there.<br />
&quot;Oh, Em, I thought you were already gone?&quot; She laughed, now getting up and looking embarrassed, though not as embarrassed as her father now looked as he shuffled into the other room. &quot;You always leave quickly after a meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just, tying my shoes!&quot; She lied. &quot;I&#39;ll be off now, bye... Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily walked away, completely flabbergasted. In a normal circumstance, after that, she&#39;d have totally turned everybody back to normal. And of course she was planning to do so, 100%, but she just wanted to talk to Olivia first. Her curiosity about this new reality was too good to pass up on. &quot;Sorry, Rick, don&#39;t kill me later.&quot; She muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
After just a few minutes of searching, she found her mother folding clothes which were fresh from the dryer. She spotted Emily entering the room, and so gave her a wave.<br />
&quot;Come to visit me, Em?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, I wanted to talk to you mo-er, Miss Olivia.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Talk to me? About what dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About... my dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Olivia asked, seemingly very confused at that question. &quot;What about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you, know him before he hired you?&quot; She asked, remembering how she once told her that the two met in college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your mother put you up to this?&quot; Olivia chuckled before messing up Emily&#39;s hair. &quot;I swear you red heads, all trouble makers the lot of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would my mom ask me to ask you that?&quot; Emily asked, now even more curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;So she didn&#39;t?&quot; Olivia asked genuinely, before sighing after Emily nodded her head. &quot;Well, Rebecca and I met Paul in college, and the two of us had the hots for him. We were sorority sisters, oh my you wouldn&#39;t know what that is... it&#39;s like, a club in college where everyone are super best friends.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow cool.&quot; Emily fake reacted to the idea, now briefly thinking about the hazing and shit she had to go through for hers. &quot;So what happened next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since we both found him attractive, we made an agreement to not approach him, and let him decide which of us to go after. And he chose your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; Emily replied, shocked that between her attractive mother, and the female version of Rick, apparently her father found Rick hotter.... and she had ZERO idea what to do with THAT info. Maybe tease Rick? She shook off the crazy thoughts, though, and focused back in on Olivia. &quot;So, were you like, jealous ever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Em honey, I was livid. We didn&#39;t talk for a week, but after a while I missed her and the two of us were okay. And now we&#39;re besties till the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... why do you work for her and not, like, someone else?&quot; Emily asked bluntly, deciding to use her younger form as a way to get at the bigger questions easier.<br />
<br />
Olivia laughed hard for a moment before sighing. &quot;Well, I graduated with a degree in math, and got a job as an accountant. I actually worked at the same company as your father. We hung out, and he helped me look for love, but it never worked out. I swear he was the only decent looking man in the building.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily did remember saying that working together helped fuel their love. &quot;And then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I moved on. Drifted for a while, finding guys, but never the right one for me. Jobs wise, too, I was lost. Didn&#39;t know what I wanted... well actually, no, if I&#39;m being honest, my lazy girl dream was to be a good housewife.&quot; She laughed, but Emily could tell that the joke was to hide the obvious, as everything made sense now. Her mom loved to clean and organize, but HATED the 9 to 5.<br />
<br />
&quot;By then, your parents made it big, and I hung around more often until I was living here. I think your mother made a joke about me being their made and a couple of weeks later... hear I am.&quot; She smiled, gesturing to her uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;They make you wear that?&quot; She sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I actually just feel like I look kill - AH!&quot; She stopped herself as her face grew red. &quot;Okay, you have GOT to be up to something little lady, you are never this talkative.... what did you break?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing I swear.&quot; She laughed, thinking to herself &quot;except reality&quot; before she turned and began to walk away. &quot;Goodbye Olivia.&quot; She called, leaving a very confused maid left with a lot more laundry to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, mystery solved.... but now what?&quot; Emily thought to herself. She needed to restore the original reality, but how would they even start to go about that? Maybe a starting place could be Rick&#39;s awareness? Rick as a whole bugged her right now, as seeing him... or rather, her, like that with her dad was weird as hell. Maybe she could role swap Rebecca to be the maid first? Or maybe blend in with something more fitting to make him a male again?<br />
<br />
Then there was the thought about this reality in general... she couldn&#39;t lie, the idea of being rich seemed too good to pass up on. Was there a way to keep it? She thought hard for a few minutes, staring at the camera, before finally...</p>
