<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
A few miles down the road, Eric and his family were finishing up their own dinner. At one point, Eric looked up and thought he saw someone watching them through the window. But there was nothing there, and he brushed off the feeling. He was just being paranoid, no one would trudge out to the middle of nowhere just to spy on his family. Why would they? To get his mom’s recipe for roasted chicken? <br />
<br />
Eric’s father brought him back into the conversation by asking how his day went. Mostly in regards to Cassie. <br />
<br />
“Good. She’s gonna apply for the spring semester.”<br />
<br />
“She’s not already in school?”<br />
<br />
“Uh no, her parents made her take a year off after high school. She’s only a year younger than me.” <br />
<br />
“Huh, so why do you know why her parents wanted her to take the year off?” <br />
<br />
“She said it was complicated, I didn’t think it was any of my business to press.” Eric shrugged, knowing the real explanation would raise eyebrows. Or result in his parents forbidding him to ever see Cassie again. <br />
<br />
“I was thinking of having the Turners over for dinner sometime this week. Would that be alright Eric?” his mom asked. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to ask my permission, go ahead. I already met her parents when I picked her up this morning, and they seemed nice enough.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t suppose Cassie has an older sister… Ow, I was kidding alright! Sheesh.” Jamie winced, Eric striking a blow to his arm. He hit Jamie harder than he intended to. Eric muttered an apology, also making a mental note that he had to be more careful with his newfound strength. <br />
<br />
After dinner Eric went up to his bedroom. Unlike last night, his desire had since abated. Striping his clothing off, Eric examined his body. It was becoming a routine, checking his figure for new changes or developments. His cock was comfortably resting inside his furred sheath. Eric cupped his balls, enjoying how full they were. <br />
<br />
“Full of wolf cum no doubt. I can’t believe this is happening to me. Three days ago I was a normal human, now I’m turning into a werewolf. Insane.” Eric thought, gently dropping his balls. He leaned in closer to the mirror to look at his teeth. His incisors were larger, thankfully not so big that people would stare at him. Eric ran his tongue over them, noting they were much sharper now. Perfect for tearing through meat, or flesh. The edges of his ears had a thin layer of fur, easily hidden with his hair. Eric admired his six pack, complete with a long trail of dark gray fur in the center of his stomach. <br />
<br />
Eric climbed into bed naked, and wrapped himself in his sheets. The gentle fabric touching his crotch gave him goosebumps. Eric felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up. It kinda felt like there was more hair than there should be… <br />
<br />
“I guess I have to let Cassie turn me, otherwise this is just going to progress until I’m a walking Bigfoot. If she’s been able to keep it from her parents so can I. I could just transfer to another college. Cassie could come with me, if she wants to. Of course she would. She’s mine…” Eric’s trail of thought ended when he realized he thought of Cassie as his. Again, Eric found himself wondering how much of that was him, and how much was the wolf in him….<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Good morning.” Eric stood at the bottom of Cassie’s driveway, ready to walk her back through the woods to where he’d left his car the previous night. Once she came into view, Eric saw she had a huge grin on her face. He caught her scent, and his instincts told him she’d had a very “relaxing” evening. Eric’s pants felt a little tight, and he shifted his junk around so that his erection was less noticeable. It wasn’t easy, with his bigger package. <br />
<br />
“How are you doing, with the changes that is?” Cassie asked, having seen Eric struggling with his bulge. <br />
<br />
“Uh, okay. Can we walk and talk, I think… I think I’m ready.” Eric said. Cassie’s eyes widened, and she quickly followed Eric into the woods. All the while wondering how incredible fucking another wolf would be. She got herself wet imagined Eric’s transformation. His body doubling in size as his muscles grew, and his legs stretched. His fur coming in, and his cock taking on a completely canine shape. <br />
<br />
“Cassie, you listening?” Eric asked. He wasn’t blind, he could see she was getting pretty turned on. Cassie was jolted out of her fantasy, and she blushed, embarrassed she’d gotten so cared away. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, what were you saying?” she asked. <br />
<br />
“Well, I did a lot of thinking last night. Ya I can hide the changes I’ve got now from people. Might be a little weird if I ever have to go to the doctor’s and disrobe, but whatever. I’m not sure when I want to, this week, this month, in time for the next full moon… Will I go into heat too?”<br />
<br />
“As far as I know, males don’t go into ‘heat”. They just respond to the female’s scent. I did plenty of research my first month. I’m not going to force you into making the full change, but before the full moon would probably be best. That way you can develop some self control, er no offense.” Cassie eyed Eric’s pants tent. <br />
<br />
“Right. Is there anything else I should know about? Silver bullets, eating raw meat…?”<br />
<br />
“You’ve been watching too many movies. I did the silver test, nothing. As for the raw meat, I won’t lie I’ve come across deer before and had the urge to eat one. And night when I was locked in our shed, I ate the ground beef kept in the deep freezer. Nothing happened, other than some stomach cramps when I turned back. I’d advise not to eat raw meat, but it won’t kill you if you do.” Cassie explained. <br />
<br />
“Alright. And everything else is normal? You don’t start barking at mailmen, or chasing tennis balls?” <br />
<br />
“Again, stop watching so many movies. I’m in control of myself twenty four seven, except around the full moon. It’s like werewolf PMS.” Cassie said. Eric nodded and glanced at Cassie’s sex. It was covered by her shorts and undoubtedly a pair of underwear. But Eric could still picture it dripping with fluid, throbbing in need of a cock. He had a cock, a very nice one at that. He could give her what she needed, and then they could….<br />
<br />
“Earth to Eric, you in there?” Cassie waved a hand in front of his face. Eric blinked and almost ran into a tree. Cassie giggled, and helped him right himself. <br />
<br />
“Shit, sorry. I, er, got a little distracted.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“Believe me, I know. Tell you what, if you can keep it in your pants the rest of the day, I’ll let you plow me all you want later tonight. Fur, fangs and all.” Cassie pressed her breasts against Eric’s arm, and then moved her crotch closer to his body so he could feel how hot she was. <br />
<br />
“It’s a deal.” Eric said, clenching his fists as his erection strained some more in his pants. He felt Cassie’s pussy expelling heat. He could smell her arousal. Eric did everything in his power to keep himself from pushing her to the ground and ravage her. <br />
<br />
“This is not going to be easy.” Eric thought, trudging along with a painful erection in his pants. Cassie had more self control, she didn’t seem to be struggling as much as him. Granted she was still wet, but Cassie didn’t seem to pay her arousal any mind. By the time they got to the parking lot, that sweet scent was barely noticeable. Meanwhile Eric’s bulge had only gotten worse, as his mind wandered from placid thoughts to ones about mounting Cassie like an animal and fucking her. <br />
<br />
Cassie offered to drive, seeing how uncomfortable Eric was. She knew it was a little cruel to put him through this, but it was necessary. She had to learn some self control, and so would Eric. After the attack, the only thing she wanted to do was lie in bed and play with herself. What kept her from doing just that? She was in a hospital bed with doctors and nurses checking on her every five minutes. <br />
<br />
Eric and Cassie went their separate ways once they got to campus. She went back to the admissions office to do more paperwork, while Eric went off to his first class. But the longer he sat in that damn chair, the hornier he got. It was madness, here he was listening to a lecture (Eric couldn’t even say what he was so distracted), with a massive boner. He didn’t dare get up, knowing he was generously showing. He just had to wait until class was over. A few of his friends gave him bizarre looks, not doubt wondering why Eric looked like he was trying to keep from shitting his pants. That wasn’t too far off, he was trying to keep from cumming in his pants. <br />
<br />
“You feeling alright Mr. Peters?” the professor finally noticed Eric’s awkward expression, and the way he was tightly crossing his legs. <br />
<br />
“Um, yes sir. Just feeling a little… cramped.” Eric said, not sure how else to explain his situation without making a fool out of himself. <br />
<br />
“Do you need to exit the classroom? Or go to the health center?”<br />
<br />
“No, no it’s nothing like that. I’m just, uh, kinda claustrophobic?” Eric meant it to be a statement, it came out like a question. Thankfully the professor didn’t think too much of it, and went back to the lesson. But for the rest of the class, everyone was taking a few minutes to stare at Eric, and try to make sense of his odd behavior. <br />
<br />
Eric glanced at the clock and almost groaned out loud when he saw he still had an hour and a half left of his two hour class. He attempted to get erection under control. He did verb conjugations, went over multiplication tables, ran down the periodic table, even tried to recite the Gettysburg Address. Nothing seemed to work, so Eric attempted meditating. Clearing his mind of all thoughts, except that blasted boner. The throbbing deep in his shaft got worse and worse. Eric didn’t know how much longer he’d be able to keep from getting naked, pulling his wolfish cock out and stroking its length. His body felt like it was on fire! <br />
<br />
Once class finished, Eric remained seated until everyone else was gone, including his professor. He pretended to be working on something, and vehemently told his professor that he wasn’t sick and that he just needed some place quiet to work. After he left, Eric stuffed his belongings into his backpack and stood up. <br />
<br />
His erection tented out in front of him, clear as the nose on his face. He took his sweatshirt out of his backpack, and tied it around his waist in an effort to conceal at least some of his boner. The bathroom was only down the hall, he could do this. Eric had to waddle to the door, his balls swollen with seed. He felt his cock twitch with every step, the head already extended from his sheath. <br />
<br />
“Just make a break for it. It’s only five doors down, you can do this.” Eric chanted. He slung his backpack over both shoulders, tightened the knot that was keeping his sweatshirt tied together, and opened the door. Then ran like his pants were on fire, and in a way they were. His balls were caught between his body and his pants, bouncing all over the place as Eric ran. Eric cursed, trying to adjust his balls while running so they didn’t bruise his thighs. <br />
<br />
Once he made it into the bathroom, he made sure no one else was inside, then grabbed the trash can. He propped it against the door and wall so that no one would be able to open it. Then threw his backpack on the sink counter, took off his pants, and then boxers. <br />
<br />
“Oh fuck!” Eric said upon seeing his raging boner. His cock, fully extended to at least twelve inches, was completely canine now. The skin was a darker shade of pink, and shiny from all the pre cum. Eric’s knot had swollen to the size of his testicles, which were also pretty big now. The pointed end of his cock stared up at him, clearing displaying his urethra. Thick dollops of pre dripped down to the tiled floor. <br />
<br />
Eric went into one of the stalls and stood in front of the toilet, cock aimed at the bowl. Then he grasped his cock with both hands and started pumping. His body bucked as pleasure rushed over him. His tongue hung out of his mouth, rubbing against his sharp teeth. His balls dangled below, eager to release their seed. Eric started thrust in time with his pumps, effectively dry humping the air in front of him. <br />
<br />
He heard a few people try to open the bathroom door to no avail. He didn’t care, he was enjoying himself too much. Eric just needed to cum, that’s all. Then he’d be able to finish the rest of his day, go back home and then claim his reward. Seeing Cassie in her wolf form again, with those big breasts, and that tight pussy of hers… <br />
<br />
“Ahhhhaaa!” Eric exclaimed as his cum shot out into the toilet bowl. His balls pulled tight, and then released, at the same time releasing his spunk. It hit the water so hard he got splash back all over his sneakers. There was a large puddle of cum and water on his feet, not that Eric paid much attention to it. He was supporting himself on the back of the toilet, panting like an animal. His cock was still spitting out cum. <br />
<br />
Eric didn’t have anything to measure it with, but he guessed there was about half a cup of his baby batter. He never came so hard, or with so much before. He ripped off a healthy amount of toilet paper and began wiping his dick off. Once he was finished his cock retreated back into his sheath. He couldn’t put his pants or boxers on without the waistband going around the middle of his length. Eric put a layer of toilet paper in between his sensitive organ and the elastic so as not to get himself aroused again. Then he tugged his pants back up and washed himself clean of any cum. <br />
<br />
What he saw in mirror startled him, and confirmed that now he HAD to let Cassie change him. There was no other alternative. His ears were long and pointed, covered in gray fur. Eric held out his hands and saw short claws had broken through his nails. His palms had a thin layer of fur on them, and some part of him chuckled at the irony of him having hairy palms. The back’s of his hands had fur too, darker gray fur that ran up his forearm. Eric’s tongue felt larger, like it wasn’t quite fitting inside his mouth. Eric touched a trail of hair on his jawline, feeling how soft it was. Then saw another line of fur running down his back, over his spine to his tailbone, which now protruded from his back. He pressed a finger to it, surprised at how sensitive it was. <br />
<br />
Suddenly another change hit him, and Eric was forced to kick his sneakers off. In his haste, he lost his balance and landed squarely on his ass. Eric didn’t have time to wince or grimace as His socks were bulging at the seams, exploding into lots of little pieces in second. More gray fur covered the top of hs foot, and was quickly spreading up Eric’s calf. His face contorted into a grimace as his toes grew larger and larger still. There was a sickening snap, and Eric felt his bones moving under his skin. He held back the urge to puke, and looked down. <br />
<br />
His big toe was being pulled back by some unforeseen force, a hooked claw forming at the tip as it moved. Eric found he could still move his new dew claw just like the rest of his toes. Well, he could move the claw, even retract it like a cat would be able to. The rest of Eric’s toes grew similar sharp claws, and thick callouses that eventually became pads. His heel seemingly stretched backwards and away from the rest of his foot. When it was over, Eric stared completely dumbfounded at his new paws. <br />
<br />
Tremors ran up his legs as Eric tried to stand. It felt so weird, Eric imagined this was how women felt when they wore heels. Except they weren’t physically attached to their bodies. Steadying himself on the stall door, Eric took baby steps forward until he was able to walk. He was a couple of inches taller, but if he bent his knees enough he could get closer to his normal height. <br />
<br />
“Great, just fucking great. Now what am I going to do?” he thought, still staring in disbelief at his newest change. Eric had to bend down avoid hitting his head on the doorframe of the stall. Looking at himself in the mirror, Eric realizing that Cassie had a point. He couldn’t control himself, and this is what happened. He put his shoes on as best he could, concealing most of his paws. <br />
<br />
But where his ankles should be, you could see fur and muscle. So Eric reluctantly undid his belt and let his pants sag down so they would cover his legs completely. Of course that left his tail partially exposed, but Eric didn’t think anyone would really notice with his backpack on. He had to wear the sweatshirt, even though it was eighty some degrees outside. The hood was the only thing he had to conceal his pointed ears. <br />
<br />
Shouldering his backpack, he took a step forward. Unfortunately, walking with paws wasn’t made any easier with the sneakers on. Eric nearly face-planted on the ground managing to catch himself on the sink before his face met the grimy floor. He moved the trash can away from the door, and pushed the door open. <br />
<br />
Eric shuffled along, using the wall for support when he lost his balance. People gave him a few odd looks, as expected, but mostly didn’t pay him much attention. Eric was relieved to have a few seconds to rest in the elevator. He leaned against the cool metal surface, slumping a bit in exhaustion. He still had a ways to go before he reached his car. <br />
<br />
“You can do this. Just get to the car, wait for Cassie and do… it.” Eric avoided any thoughts of what he had to do in fear he’d get another erection. And he couldn’t deal with a two foot tail and a muzzle on his own, let alone without someone calling the cops or government. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cassie was having a considerably better day than Eric. She made a few friends, even had a couple of guys hit on her. Flattered of course, but she turned them down. Not knowing she could hear them, most of the guys walked away cursing Eric. Cassie giggled and decided to go find him, as she hadn’t seen him since the morning. She searched a few buildings before she caught his scent. <br />
<br />
Something was wrong, very wrong. His scent was so intense in one particular classroom, and the trail that lead into the hallway even stronger. Cassie followed the smell to the boy’s bathroom and a horrible feeling crossed her when she realized what happened. She could only hope Eric was alright. Obviously the changes weren’t so bad because ehe’d been able to leave. Unless… could he have gone all the way? No, she’d have heard something about a giant wolf creature running around campus in broad daylight. <br />
<br />
There wasn’t anyone else around, so Cassie decided to inspect the damage in the bathroom. Her nose was immediately assaulted with scents that would have aroused her had she not been expecting them. She looked into the stall that smelled the strongest. Remnants of Eric’s time there, dried cum on the wall, drew her attention first. Then pieces of fabric under the toilet, which had dry cum on its handle and seat. <br />
<br />
“Geez, looks like he had a really big load. That couldn’t have been good for his body. God I hope he’s not walking around with a tail stuffed into his pants or something worse.” Cassie thought. She departed the bathroom as quickly as she’d entered. As she exited the building, still tracking Eric’s pungent scent, a guy with short brown hair came up to her. He looked like a football player, wide-set shoulders and a strong jaw. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Cassie right? Eric’s girl?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“I suppose you could say that. And you are…?”<br />
<br />
“Scott. Dude hasn’t talked about me at all? Shame on him. Anyways, have you seen Eric around? Can’t find him, and everyone keeps saying how weird he was in class.”<br />
<br />
“Weird how?” Cassie asked, fearing the worst. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. Like, he was sitting there looking like he was about to shit himself. His face was all flushed and he had this distant look in his eyes. Said he was claustrophobic, first I’ve heard. Then again he never did like elevators much… I’m guessing based on your expression you haven’t seen him.” Scott said. <br />
<br />
“No, sorry. Actually I was looking for him too.”<br />
<br />
“Would you care to look for him together? I’m sure we’ve both got a lot of questions for him.” Scott said. <br />
<br />
Cassie was forced to nod, unable to come up with a good excuse why Scott couldn’t tag along. She didn’t know if Eric wanted to tell him about his recent changes, and she certainly didn’t want to tell Scott about her being a werewolf if she didn’t have to. Cassie had nightmares about someone blabbing, which would result in her getting carted away to some government lab to be dissected. <br />
<br />
As they walked, Scott did most of the talking. Which was good because it let Cassie continue to follow Eric’s scent without raising eyebrows. Scott gave Cassie his entire life story in ten minutes. She nodded every few seconds or giggled to make him think she was listening. She was only half listening. No, even less. More like one sixteenth listening. Cassie didn’t care about Scott’s second grade talent show, she was worried Eric was hiding somewhere covered in fur. If she could have, she would put her nose to the ground and start tracking him like a bloodhound. <br />
<br />
Finally, Eric’s scent got stronger, so strong Cassie new it was fresh. They were standing only a few feet away from the parking lot. She scanned the cars, finding his, and then squinted to see if Eric was inside. The windows were tinted, but Cassie thought she saw something moving inside. Scott didn’t notice, so Cassie took the opportunity to get him off the trail (so to speak). <br />
<br />
“Where is Eric’s next class?” she asked. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, Parker Hall I think. But if he was as sick looking as everyone said I doubt he’d go to class. Maybe he just went home.” Scott said. <br />
<br />
“His car is still in the lot, maybe he went to see a nurse or something.” Cassie offered. <br />
<br />
“Ya. Tell you what, I’ll go check he’s not in class and then meet you at the health center. You know where that is don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Near admissions?”<br />
<br />
“10 points to you Ms. Turner. I’ll see you around. And if you do find Eric, give him a kick in the pants for me.” Scott said, adding a twenty carat smile for effect. He walked away, thinking he’d scored some points with Cassie. Not that he was typically one of those guys who tried to steal a friend’s girl, but Cassie was too hot not to. Plus Scott got the feeling she was one of those party animal girls. He’d love to take her to one of his fraternity parties. He’d never do anything like drug her, maybe get her a little drunk and see if he could score… <br />
<br />
Cassie waited until Scott was around the corner before changing directions and running to Eric’s car. His scent got stronger and stronger, making her run faster. By the time she got to the car window, she could clearly hear what, to the unknowing ear, sounded like a dog panting. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A bit earlier… <br />
<br />
Eric made it outside, and to the edge of the parking lot with no problems. He couldn’t wait to get to his car, kick off his stupid shoes, take off the sweatshirt, crank up the A/C and relax. He was sweating bullets, and it was making his chest fur (fur not hair) all smelly. Wet dog kind of smelly. And he almost made it to his car with no problems. And then someone tapped him on the shoulder, making him yelp in a very dog-like manner. <br />
<br />
Spinning around on his heels (really on his paws), Eric saw an attractive blonde standing behind him. He’d been so focused on just walking without falling over he hadn’t noticed her approaching. She looked like she was heading to the gym, wearing tight fitting, spandex-looking clothing. <br />
<br />
“Whoa, sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. It’s just that you didn’t hear me calling your name. You are Eric aren’t you?” she said. <br />
<br />
“Ya that’s me. And don’t worry about it, I’m not really with it today. Was actually going home, think I’m coming down with something.” Eric said, trying to play up the “sick” factor in hopes of getting this girl away from him. It had worked with everyone else he’d encountered on his long, uncomfortable walk to the parking lot. But not on this girl. <br />
<br />
“I could drive you home if you like. You live on…”<br />
<br />
“Really, you don’t have to do that. I wouldn’t want to give you whatever I have. I’m okay to drive.” Eric said quickly. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure? You’re wearing a sweatshirt when it’s like eighty-seven degrees outside, and you’re walking like you’ve someone just kicked you in the nuts.” the girl commented. <br />
<br />
“Look, I don’t mean to be rude, and I appreciate you trying to help, but I really just want to be alone right now. I don’t even know your name.”<br />
<br />
“Sandy, ya I know how ironic is that? And don’t feel bad about that, I get it. Actually I was looking for you because Gina wanted to invite you to this party she’s throwing Thursday night.” she said. <br />
<br />
Eric groaned inside, his day just getting worse and worse. He’d known Gina for years, since they were in junior high together. She’d been trying relentlessly to get him ever since their first, and very brief, meeting in Pre-Algebra. And by “get”… let’s just say Gina’s reputation proceeded her. Her high school nickname, not that anyone called her it to her face, was Va-Gina. There were few guys in their class who hadn’t gone to bed with her on one occasion. Eric was one of those few. <br />
<br />
“Just tell her I can’t come. Better yet, just tell her to stop inviting me. In the seven years she’s known me, have I ever gone to one of her parties? Or returned any of her calls? Or also made kissy faces in the window of my car to her? No. I don’t know how close you are to her but…” <br />
<br />
“I know Gina’s pushy, it’s fine. I’m not that close, really I just hang with her crowd so I can use her Netflix. I’m sure you know, if I do tell her you said no she’ll be sending me back with a more, er, ‘intense’ offer.” Sandy gave Eric one of those “you know what I’m talking about” looks, and Eric know. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for the heads up.” Eric sighed. Sandy smiled, nodded, and then said her goodbyes. Eric felt a little guilty. She seemed like a nice girl, pretty too. Under different circumstances, like had he not met Cassie and romped with her in the woods, Eric might have hit on her. As Sandy walked away, his eyes landed on her ass. Held tight in running shorts, and that ht pink shirt. She must have felt him staring, because she turned around to wave. <br />
<br />
Eric waved back, but his eyes were glued to her chest. The outline of her sports bra, and… oh god he could see her nipples through the thin fabric. Her breasts bounced as she turned around. Those supple, round… with big nips for him to suckle on and play with… <br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Eric bit his lip as his cock strained in his pants. He quickly unlocked his car, and jumped into the backseat. He threw his backpack into the front seat, and proceeded to strip naked. His clawed hands ripped his clothing to shreds and releasing his sweaty body from the confining fabric. His balls hung down, again swollen with desire. His tail twitched behind him, and Eric arched his back as wave after wave of lust rocked his body. He knew he shouldn’t, knew he’d be kicking himself later if he did it. But he had to. The heat, oh christ the heat was too much. His skin felt like it was on fire, his cock hurt it was throbbing so hard. Most of the blood in his body must have gone to his canine phallus. <br />
<br />
Eric flexed his paws as he gripped his red member. His eyes rolled back into his head, and his tongue rolled out of his mouth. He started panting as he stroked himself. The panting was interrupted by soft whines every so often. Eric felt so… he didn’t even have a word to describe how he felt at that moment. Mad with this desire to rut and fuck whatever female let him? That was fairly accurate. Eric pumped the full length of his dick, from his huge knot to the pointed tip that was slick with pre. <br />
<br />
He started humping the air in front of him, pre dripping down onto his hairy chest. Eric planted his paws firmly on the door, and in one fluid motion thrusted upwards. His panting got more labored as he felt his body preparing for his orgasm. Oh it was going to be so good, so intense. His balls were so full, he’d make so much cum. Eric panted in anticipation. He needed to cum, he wanted to, he felt like he’d die if he didn’t. As his muscled tensed, he caught the scent of a female. She was close to him, she smelled so good. Had she come to help him? <br />
<br />
“Yes, yes, yes!” Eric thought. His mind pictured himself standing behind a female, rutting her like an animal. And then his knot swelling, locking them together. Eric’s tongue grew another inch, and became even more sensitive as his body was on the cusp of release. His panting became more dog like and the end of his nose changed. Turning black, the skin turning cold and wet. He had a dog nose, and he smelled a ready female. <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Cassie threw the door open, Eric having left it unlocked in his haste to masturbate. She opened it just as Eric came. Cum splattered onto the roof of his car, rebounding everywhere. Most of it landed on Eric, dirtying his musty, sweaty fur, and a bit landed on Cassie. A wall of intense, thick air hit her equally sensitive nose, and she found herself instantly reacting, whether she wanted to or not. Cassie was wet, and Eric smelled that. He whimpered, and tried to sit up. Gaining control of herself before she too did something stupid, Cassie shoved him back down. <br />
<br />
She jumped in the front seat, locked the doors and looked at Eric. He was more wolf than human. His legs were completely covered in gray fur, ending in big paws. His face was on the verge of morphing into a canine muzzle, his nose already transformed. He had triangular ears sticking up from his matted hair, and his eyes were gold in color. His long canine tongue was dripping saliva, and Cassie noted that Eric’s teeth were much bigger, and sharper. She heard a gentle thumping, and knew Eric must have a tail of some length. Based on how quiet the thumping was, it couldn’t be too long, <br />
<br />
His hands were half paw-half hands. Fur covering his forearms and hands, black pads like the ones on bottoms of his feet turned paws on his fingers. And though she tried not to, Cassie saw that Eric’s cock and balls were completely canine now as well. The sheer size of his erect member made her wet. It was at least a foot long, not taking into account that huge swollen knot. And his balls, they must be the size of grapefruits. <br />
<br />
“Eric, get a hold of yourself. Look at what you’ve done to your body! You have to stop, or you’ll lose control. If you haven’t already!” Cassie said. Eric blinked, not fully comprehending her words. What was the female saying to him? Was she talking to him? Her mouth was moving but Eric couldn’t decipher the sounds. He whined, and his cock twitched. Didn’t she understand that it was mating season. She was supposed to be presenting herself to him. He was ready, SHE was ready. Eric could smell her arousal. <br />
<br />
“Damn it, am I getting through to you at all Eric?” Cassie asked. All she got in response was a confused and needy stare. Resigning that Eric was too far gone, and the wolf inside him was overpowering his human senses, Cassie reached forward. Eric thought it was to touch his cock, and he yipped happily. But then she grabbed his keys, which were on the floor. <br />
<br />
That’s when Eric got angry. The female was deliberately ignoring him! She didn’t want to take his seed. How could she be so uncooperative?! She needed him just as much as he needed her. Eric growled, and in a moment of pure animal instinct bit Cassie’s arm. She cried out in pain, not expecting Eric to respond in such a way. Seeing her face grimace, and watching blood drip to the carpet, Eric snapped out of whatever spell he’d been under. He quickly released Cassie’s arm, but the damage was done. Cassie had a sizable bite mark, and it was steadily bleeding. No so much that she was in any serious danger of dying, but it wasn’t comfortable by any standard either. <br />
<br />
“Oh god Cassie, what did I do? I… holy shit look at me! I’m sorry. Oh my god I… I’m so sorry. I can, no, oh Jesus fucking Christ I can’t do anything looking like this. Oh fuck, oh fuck!” Eric said, realizing how much he’d changed since his last orgasm. He put his head in his hand-paws and took a few deep breathes to calm down. But his head was bent over, staring at his dripping phallus and that only made him more disgusted with himself. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay Eric. You didn’t know what you were doing, it happened to me a lot too after I first change. Let’s just get you somewhere more private. We can’t let anyone see you like this.” Cassie said, putting the key in the ignition. She kept her cool, though inside was screaming because her arm hurt. One thing Hollywood didn’t get right, werewolves weren’t spectacular healers. <br />
<br />
Cassie did have more tolerance for pain, in fact once she hadn’t even realized she’d slammed her finger in a door, but flesh wounds still hurt like they would any normal person. And a bit from Eric that went at least half an inch into her skin certainly hurt. <br />
<br />
Eric remained silent in the back seat as Cassie drove them back towards her house. He felt so ashamed of himself. He’d lost control. He was letting some horny wolf dictate his actions. Worst of all, he’d hurt Cassie, and did have some memory of doing it. That could have been anyone, literally anyone. And Eric would have lost control in front of a normal person, and done much worse to them. Maybe even… His stomach turned and he hugged his furry legs closer to his body. <br />
<br />
Cassie looked in the rearview mirror, and saw Eric was crying. His body was curled into a fetal position on the backseat. Tears streamed down his face, and his nose was wetter than before. And as if that wasn’t a sad enough eight, Eric was whimpering like a dog who’d just been kicked by its master. He was so distraught, despite the fact that Cassie wasn’t angry at him. Just the opposite really, she was relieved Eric came to his senses. She knew he hadn’t meant to hurt her, in fact she’d done worse to herself in the past. But at the same time, Cassie knew nothing she said could make him feel better. So she just drove, knowing Eric needed this time to himself. <br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was a long, awkward car ride back. Eric kept quiet, and Cassie focused on driving. Her arm slowly stopped bleeding, becoming more of a nuisance than a serious pain. She could tolerate more pain than the average human, but she couldn’t heal in less than fifteen minutes. Once she pulled into her driveway, Cassie turned around to face Eric. Who had uncurled his body, but still looked very defeated. His ears were dropping and his tail was wrapped tightly around his torso. <br />
<br />
“I know you probably hate yourself right now, but you have no reason to feel bad Eric. It was an accident. Look, it’s not even that bad of a bite. Believe me, I’ve done worse.” Cassie said in an attempt to cheer him up. It didn’t work. Eric hung his head and muttered something about being a stupid, hormonal, fur-covered bag of shit. <br />
<br />
“You are not. Now, put on a happy face and come inside. If you stay out here in the car I might get a call from animal control about a dog locked in a car on my property.” Cassie joked. The corner of Eric’s mouth twitched, almost into a smile. <br />
<br />
With some help, Eric followed Cassie inside. He was a little shaky on his paws, mostly because he was so emotionally wrecked. But Eric found that having a tail actually helped with his balance. It wasn’t full size yet, but Eric learned to use it as best he could to keep himself from tipping over. Going upstairs to Cassie’s bedroom was a challenge. Eric stubbornly refused any help from Cassie. Partially because of his pride, and partially out of guilt. He felt he didn’t deserve Cassie’s help, not after what he’d done to her. Eric had about a million other ideas about how to punish himself. One of which involved going to the vet and getting “fixed”. <br />
<br />
He sat down on her bed, slumping against the wall and pinning his tail at an uncomfortable angle. Eric jumped up and then back down, this time more careful about where he sat, and where his tail was positioned. Suddenly having an extra appendage took some getting used to. Cassie walked into her bathroom to clean her arm up so it didn’t look like she was mauled by a pitbull. After washing her arm, Cassie examined the wound. It wasn’t that bad, easily concealable with the right clothing. You couldn’t even tell that the marks were made by teeth of any kind. Though the list of other explanations for her injuries was very short. Would her parents believe she fell on a pile of knitting needles? <br />
<br />
Cassie didn’t need to put any bandages on. For one thing, by the end of the week the wound would be mostly healed. For another, if she transformed with any sort of bandage on it would just be torn. So Cassie went back into her bedroom to check on Eric with the bite mark clearly visible to him. Upon seeing it Eric felt even guiltier. He felt so bad, and to him it looked extremely painful. <br />
<br />
“Cassie, I’m….”<br />
<br />
“I know you’re worry, but what did I saw earlier? I’m not mad, and you have no reason to feel so distraught. You got overwhelmed, it happens to everyone. Granted not everyone is a werewolf in the making, but still.”<br />
<br />
“But I did lose control. What if happens again, only not around you? I might have killed someone…” Eric felt like crying again. Cassie sat beside him on her bed, wrapping an arm around Eric for support. <br />
<br />
“Listen, don’t think like that. It won’t do you any good, thinking what if, or what could have been. What’s happened has happened, you shouldn’t beat yourself up. Now, I know you’re probably not in the mood to finish your change, so why don’t we do something to get your mind off things. Water gun fight?” Cassie half joked. Eric looked up at her, one eyebrow raised, and one ear perked forward. <br />
<br />
“Come again?”<br />
<br />
“Actually what I had in mind was you taking a shower. You’re a mess.” Cassie said. Eric looked down at himself, and saw she was right. He was a mess, physically that is. His dark fur was covered in a dirty mixture of cum, dried blood, and something Eric couldn’t identify by scent. But he wasn’t a fan of the smell. <br />
<br />
“Good point. Uh, where is…?”<br />
<br />
“Right there big guy. Try not to get the drain stopped up with hair.” she cautioned. As fun as it was to take a shower with fur, it wasn’t easy on the pipes. <br />
<br />
Eric was already half naked, he’d slipped his boxers back on and then his shirt to make the short trip from the car to Cassie’s front door. Pants were a no go, his legs were too wolfy, and his tail got in the way. He placed his clothing on the toilet seat and then climbed into the bathtub/shower. Eric nearly slipped and fell, not used to walking on a wet surface with paws. He decided it would be safer to take a bath, rather than risk cracking his skull open on the edge of the porcelain tub. <br />
<br />
While waiting for the tub to fill, Eric looked over his body. The only part of him that wasn’t covered in fur was his face, though even that had a significant amount of stubble. His bones felt stronger, especially his jaw and brow. Perhaps anticipating the change into a full lupine muzzle? His tail was quickly submerged, and it felt extremely weird. Like wading into a pool wearing jeans and a sweatshirt weird. <br />
<br />
Eric found the smell he didn’t care for was his fur getting wet. He smelled like a wet dog. He applied a healthy amount of whatever brand of body wash Cassie had. He could deal with the fact that he smelled like strawberries and vanilla, not wet dog. Which he kinda was, a wet wolf to be exact. Eric nicked himself with his claws a few times, scrubbing the grime out of his fur with such force he’d lose track of what he was doing and cut himself. <br />
<br />
“That’s what you get for being such an idiot.” Eric muttered, watching the blood seep into the bath water. Bubbles of strawberry scented soap were intermixed with dirt and fur. Eric let the drain go, careful not to let too much hair go down. There was enough fur left over that you could have made a miniature Eric-wolf. <br />
<br />
“You all clean now?” Cassie asked from the other side of the door, hearing the drain go. <br />
<br />
“I guess.” Eric opened the door, a towel wrapped around his waist, so of. Again, his tail made it difficult. Eric couldn’t keep it still for more than a few seconds. Another towel was draped over his shoulders. Cassie couldn’t help but smile at the image, Eric halfway transformed with a bright blue towel around his waist and a yellow one on his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“You look like a college mascot.” she giggled. <br />
<br />
“Would it interest you to know that the college’s mascot is a ‘wild dog’?” <br />
<br />
“Irony at its finest. I’m glad you’re feeling a bit better.” Cassie said. <br />
<br />
“I guess you can only feel sorry for yourself for so long before it starts getting pathetic. I really am sorry though, I should have taken your warning more seriously. I didn’t think it would be so difficult to control myself, you know. It’s like someone else took control of my brain, and all I could think about…”<br />
<br />
“I know Eric. Come on, let’s talk about something else. You hungry?”<br />
<br />
“Ya!” Eric hadn’t realized it until now but he was starving. His stomach felt like an aching pit that needed to be filled or else it would start eating itself. A bit of an over exaggeration, but that’s honestly how he felt. Eric guessed it had something to do with his transformation, and all his, er, physical activities. <br />
<br />
Cassie lead him downstairs to the kitchen to get something to snack on. Eric left the towel’s in her bedroom so as not to drip water everywhere. And because the towels were covered in fur. He was certain that Cassie’s parents would notice a trail of gray fur on their nice floors. That would raise a few eyebrows. Thankfully there was a cold breeze from the air conditioning, which kept Eric’s rocket in check. <br />
<br />
Every so often he’d look down to make sure it was indeed soft. It was checking in on a misbehaving child or pet. Eric didn’t trust his own cock, especially since it seemed to have a mind of its own. Cassie didn’t say anything, but found it very amusing to see Eric glaring at his crotch. He only looked up when she put a plate of roast beef in front of him. Just roast beef, but Cassie had the feeling that was exactly what he wanted. It was, Eric tore into it as soon as Cassie’s hand left the plate. Food never tasted this good before. He was aware of the fact that he was eating like an animal, but he was so hungry it didn’t matter. <br />
<br />
“Someone worked up quite the appetite.” Cassie remarked as Eric finished the last of the meat. <br />
<br />
“Have anything else to eat?” Eric asked, wiping his mouth on a napkin, as if to reaffirm his humanity. His tail was swishing back and forth behind him, showing just how happy he was at the moment. Cassie smiled and offered Eric a package of cold cuts, ham to be exact. He wolfed that down too (pun intended). But after he felt much better. More alert, and the pit in his stomach was finally gone. Or at least kept in check by the food he’d just scarfed down. <br />
<br />
“What now? I can’t go home like this. Someone’s bound to tell my brother about what happened, he’ll go looking for me. I don’t want to get you into trouble Cassie. I’ve done enough for one day.”<br />
<br />
“Considering how you look right now, I think you’ll be in more trouble if your brother finds you,” Cassie said, “Why not just call home and make up some story. Say you’re spending the night at a friend’s place. It’s not a total lie.” <br />
<br />
“I guess that could work. But I need to borrow a phone.”</p>
