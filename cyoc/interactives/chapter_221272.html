<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff blinked a couple times, he had been staring at the Chronivac program for hours wishing he knew what he wanted to do, and even more wishing it was easier to set up. <br />
<br />
He stood up stretching and looking out the window. Jace, the neighbor&#39;s kid, looked to be unpacking his car. Jeff felt his jealousy boil over. For the last 10 or so years Jeff had always looked up to Jace, but as Jace was currently 22, he had always been leagues beyond what Jeff at 16 could do. <br />
<br />
Jace had apparently just returned from college and is moving back home until he does something else with his life. Jeff had watched on the sidelines as Jace lived the life Jeff wanted, and did more than Jeff ever managed to.<br />
<br />
Jace had girlfriends coming over when he was 14, Jeff still hadn&#39;t gotten one. Jeff caught him sneaking out with his girlfriend at 16... again Jeff still doesn&#39;t have a girlfriend. Jace had a car and job by now, Jace had gained a muscular physique between 14 and 18, went off to college, now he has a degree in engineering or something stupid like that, while jeff is stuck here, without a car, a job, or a girl!<br />
<br />
In frustration Jeff grabbed the emitter off its cradle and pulled the trigger, pointing it at Jace. To his surprise, Jace&#39;s stats came up... he was well beyond the 20 feet the emitter claimed was its limit but up came Jace&#39;s stats, the 210 lb muscular man with movie star looks and boy next door charm.<br />
<br />
Jeff just wished he could take it all away from him and have it for himself, every last drop! &quot;Ugh!&quot; Jeff groaned in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Jeff, we have detected *frustration* and you have been on this page for 23.4 minutes, would you like some help?&quot; His computer chirped. <br />
&quot;Um, yeah?&quot; Jeff said surprised.<br />
&quot;What outcome are you hoping for?&quot; the machine asked.<br />
Jeff looked back at Jace before sitting back down, &quot;I want to... That guy next door, he just seems so much better than me. I want to be better than him for once. It&#39;s just, ugh...&quot;<br />
&quot;I am unclear who you are referring to, can you scan them with the emitter and load their profile?&quot;<br />
Resetting the emitter in its cradle Jeff selected Jace&#39;s profile, &quot;That guy, Jace.&quot; The screen flickered and flashed as comparisons were being made between Jeff&#39;s profile and Jace&#39;s.<br />
&quot;After reviewing your recent mental fluctuations, and Jace&#39;s profile, I have set up a solution to your problem that simulations show will satisfy you. Would you like me to review it with you?&quot;   <br />
Jeff visibly cringed at the thought of more minutia, &quot;No, just apply it.&quot; Jeff had stared at sliders and settings for too long already, if the machine can make him stronger, smarter, and more experienced like Jace, he&#39;d be happy. A warmth enveloped Jeff for a few seconds and then dissipated.<br />
&quot;The emitter is loaded with a package for Jace as well, please apply it and then engage with him.&quot; Jeff grabbed the emitter and aimed it at Jace who was grabbing his last articles from the car. As Jeff pulled the trigger Jace paused, looked around at the empty neighborhood, stepped back from the car, shuddered, then went along as if nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Jeff reset the emitter on the cradle, &quot;Setup complete!&quot; popped a message box with the default sound effect, along with a &quot;Good Job, you have successfully completed the setup requirements for the package you selected!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what package did I select?&quot; Jeff asked, presuming that would be easier than comprehending more of what he had slogged through for the previous hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Package 43686565727320746F20796F7520666F72206C6F6F6B696E67206465657065722C203A2D29.&quot; the program eventually finished responding despite Jeff&#39;s attempts to shut it up a third of the way through... <br />
<br />
&quot;Just go away,&quot; Jeff said shutting the program down and turning to the internet for some instant gratification.<br />
<br />
Jeff was interrupted by dinner and had forgotten about his pubescent envy binge earlier. As dinner finished he was reminded to take the garbage to the curb by his mother, and set about collecting things. As he rolled the oversized bin outside he heard the neighbor&#39;s door door shut, looking over Jace sprinted to his car and waved, seeing Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jeff called depositing the bin at the curb. Normally he&#39;d leave it at that, but as he was walking back he felt it would be rude to not say more, but what should he say? The car door slammed and Jace was turned to go inside. &quot;Uh, Welcome home!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey, thanks.&quot; Jace called back absently still aiming for inside, Jeff felt slightly dismayed at this, but then Jace seemed to reconsider and turned back to Jeff who was stopped in the driveway.<br />
<br />
The pair took several steps towards one another, both inexplicably feeling excitement at eachother&#39;s presence and smiles creeping onto their faces from nowhere. &quot;I saw you unpacking your car today. Lots of...&quot; Jeff trailed off, &#39;Jace&#39;s face, its so unbelievably handsome.&#39; Jeff thought. But this time it was free of envy and simply full of appreciation, like basking in the last golden rays as the sun sets.<br />
<br />
Jace absentmindedly wadded up his headphones and shoved them in his pocket without moving his gaze from Jeff as he got within conversation distance of Jeff. &quot;I&#39;ve never noticed how... you&#39;ve changed so much since...&quot; Jace started but couldn&#39;t seem to finish, his hand instinctively moving to caress Jeff&#39;s face, but he paused realizing what he was doing, realizing this was strange.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw Jace&#39;s hand hesitate inches away from him and nuzzled into it, holding it against his face, feeling Jace&#39;s warmth, taking comfort in the contact. Jeff pressed Jace&#39;s hand into him, lost in the euphoria of the connection, his hand traced up Jace&#39;s muscular arm lightly grazing over Jace&#39;s arm hair.<br />
<br />
Jace&#39;s hand slipped further back, gripping Jeff&#39;s head, gently the gap between them closed more and Jeff offered no resistance. &quot;I want to kiss you,&quot; Jace said softly, almost hesitantly. Jeff&#39;s lips quivered involuntarily and his head unconsciously tilted up to the taller man. Jace started to move in, &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m not gay.&quot; a flash of confusion crossed his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither am I,&quot; Jeff said stepping closer, placing his hand on Jace&#39;s defined chest, and in one smooth motion running his hand down over his nipple eliciting a surprised and sensuous moan from Jace. Jeffs hand ended on Jace&#39;s back where Jeff pulled Jace the final distance into him and reached up connecting his first kiss.<br />
<br />
The effect was immediate and mutual, the pair began kissing passionately as though they had been lovers torn apart. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening,&quot; Jace muttered. &quot;Me either,&quot; came Jeff&#39;s reply. They stumbled awkwardly to the side of the house for the tiniest bit of more privacy, Jace held Jeff&#39;s face, Jeff wrapped his arm around Jace&#39;s lower back and braced himself against the side of his neighbor&#39;s house.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, somethings happening to you,&quot; Jace said suddenly in surprise. Jeff paused, Jace caressed his face and looked closely, &quot;You&#39;re growing stubble!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Jeff said barely registering what was even said, before pressing Jace into the house. A moment later, Jeff couldn&#39;t resist any more, his bracing hand moved down to feel more of Jace&#39;s body, his soft, smooth, dainty body, and his boobs! Jeff bent down to kiss his neck and, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re changing too,&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Jace&#39;s hand had moved down to Jeff&#39;s chest and instinctively started trying to undress him. &quot;My bedroom,&quot; Jace whispered breathily.<br />
<br />
The pair raced past Jace&#39;s car and Jeff noticed Jace&#39;s parent&#39;s car was no longer sitting in the driveway, but didn&#39;t hear them leave. Jeff was following a step behind and the pair undressed each other while continuing to make out. They worked their way onto the bed, Jeff was on top looking down, &quot;Jace, You&#39;re a woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a man,&quot; Jace responded making Jeff briefly look at his exposed body. Jeff saw he had changed significantly, muscles, body hair, he didn&#39;t feel weird though... the only thing he felt right now was horny! They shared a glance knowing they each felt the same way and she reached down to guide Jeff&#39;s penis into her.<br />
<br />
Once they had repeated mind blowing sex, Jeff realized he had been calling Jace, Jackie or Babe... but it was spelled Jacy, and it felt unsettlingly normal. The familiar feeling room he was in was distinctly feminine and very different from the masculine one he entered. She stepped back into the room from the shower she had just taken. &quot;Hey Babe, we should talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should shower before my parents come home,&quot; Jacy cut him off.<br />
&quot;You remember don&#39;t you? You know what happened?&quot; Jeff was fearful that he was alone in reality shifting underneath him.<br />
&quot;I do, and we can talk about it once you shower and dress you big beautiful lug.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s penis twitched at the nickname, but he was shooed into the bathroom with a pile of clothes before he could ask more questions. The still mostly fogged mirror gave Jeff glimpses of himself, enough to know he now certainly qualified as a lug, complete with ample body hair and heavy stubble. He quickly bathed, dressed in familiar clothes he&#39;d never seen before, and went back to his girlfriend&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re dating,&quot; Jeff whispered as he entered the room and shut the door.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jacy responded nonchalantly. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re a woman!&quot; Jeff said growing frustrated.<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re a man, we already discussed this.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not supposed to be! We gotta find a way to change you back!&quot;<br />
&quot;But you told me you aren&#39;t gay,&quot;<br />
&quot;Im not!&quot;<br />
&quot;Then I don&#39;t want to go back.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Then you want to stay a woman? Did you always want to be a woman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh god no, Jace would have detested this, it would have ruined his life, he would have sooner ended it than stay like this.&quot;<br />
Jeff visibly paled, &quot;No, we can fix it, I think I know what happened, I can change you back!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not Jace, I&#39;m Jacy. I have a very satisfying relationship that I think is the real thing, I&#39;m not an anthropology major, and I don&#39;t have to worry about women who are varying degrees of users and posers. I don&#39;t want to go back. Plus, you&#39;re a better man at 19 than I ever was at 22. Maybe I can convince you?&quot;<br />
She guided Jeff to the bed and as he sat she slipped his pant down, within seconds Jeff was being given one of the best blowjobs he ever got.<br />
<br />
In this reality, he was always the charming athletic Adonis. He had all the relationship experience. And he finally tried a relationship with the same aged neighbor girl next door the summer after turning 18 as the summer after high school started. While at school, when they couldn&#39;t see each other for months, their relationship was open. Jeff would have hated the idea of that, but this body gets pent up so quickly and so easily. The sex is just sex but Jacy, she gets the emotional side, as well as the sexual side, and the loyal side of Jeff...<br />
<br />
As unsure of how Jeff felt about his new life he knew he would be hard pressed to let go of his life with Jacy,</p>
