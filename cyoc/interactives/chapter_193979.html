<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel found himself standing infront of a new store in the mall. He heard rumors of the store, the magic shop. The reason he was here was because of a dare with his co-workers. He sighed as he went in to the store. He looked around looking to see what he should buy. <br />
<br />
He saw other people looking around the store as well. He was browsing some stuff, when an employee came up to him and asked &quot;would you like some help sir?&quot; He decided to tell the female employee about the dare. The employee giggled at it and said &quot;Is there any specifics of the dare besides just coming here and buying something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya&quot; Gabriel responded &quot;The dare says I have to buy something embarrassing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh. Why don&#39;t you tell me about your friends and yourself, so I can help find an embarrassing product for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel proceeded to tell the employee about his friends Jeff, Kyle, and Amber, and himself. He didn&#39;t find it weird that he was telling a complete stranger, about himself and his friends. The employee then proceeded to go into the backroom and came back with a small box, she then opened it and proceeded to bring out a necklace. The necklace was very feminine looking and has a strange symbol on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this will look cute on you, but I think we can go further. Why don&#39;t we dress you up in some sexy clothes. From what I can tell your friends won&#39;t be satisfied with just the necklace.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel sighed agreeing with the employee. He knew his friends would just laugh at him, if he came back with just a necklace. He followed her to the changing rooms. He went in and waited for the employee to find some clothes for him to wear, to satisfy his friends need for his embarrassment. He got handed a bag with the clothes, the employee chose for him.<br />
<br />
He sighed when he dumped the clothes out of the bag and saw they were all women clothing. He man up however and went through with changing into the clothes. As he was sorting what to try on he realized that there was sexy lingerie as well. Gabriel debated on whether to put them on or not and decided to try, he felt as he might as well go all out. <br />
<br />
He stripped naked and began to put on the sexy ensemble the employee had given him. He put on a very lacy black panty followed by a lacy black garter belt and a pair of sexy, black, knee length stockings which he hooked up to the garter belt. He found a lacy black babydoll and slipped it on. He felt ridiculous wearing the lingerie set. He put on some 2 inch high heels on, just to make him feel even sillier.<br />
<br />
The last thing he slipped on to himself was the strange necklace. As he looked at himself in the mirror, as he was shaking his head at how ridiculous he looked, he saw the necklace give a pink glow. It blinded him in the reflection and he closed his eyes. When he saw that the light died down, he opened his eyes to see the necklace had turn into a sexy lacy black choker with the symbol attached. <br />
<br />
Gabriel shook his head in disbelief at what just happened, the metal necklace turned into a sexy black choker. The rumors about the store are true. However he didn&#39;t have much time to think about it as he felt his body grow hot. He started to pant and after a while the pant became a feminine moan. Gabriel felt and saw his body change. <br />
<br />
His body shifted becoming curvy and feminine. His hair grew down intill it reached his ass, speaking of which his ass expanded tightening the panty around his crotch. HIs hips flared out as his waist pulled in. His dick disappeared into a slit as his thighs grew. His feet shrank now better fitting in the heels. He saw as all his body hair below his eyebrows disappeared. He felt a pressure behind his nipples and saw them expand till they filled out the babydoll. <br />
<br />
The change into a women was something else but he felt like his changes weren&#39;t over yet. He then saw his skin turn red, his eyes became slits with his sclera becoming black and his iris changing from brown to amber. He saw and felt as a pair of horns burst out of his skull, his canines lengthen into fangs, his tongue became long and prehensile. He bent over a little bit in pleasure and pain as a pair of large bat like wings burst out of his back and a long prehensile, spaded tail ripped its way out from just above his ass. <br />
<br />
Gabriel no longer saw himself looking back at him in the mirror, instead he saw a sexy succubus staring back. He felt as power then flow into him from the choker and realize he wasn&#39;t just any old succubus he was now the Icon of lust or lust itself, either way he was above any regular succubus. He now she, she realize was a being of pure lust, but had a limiter on her. It seems, she realize that the items sold by the magic shop all have limiters on them to prevent any one from becoming to powerful right away.<br />
<br />
She felt her limit was that despite essentially being now the physical manifestation of lust, she can only be a she. She can&#39;t turn into a man or even a Futa/Herm, she can only be female. She was only the Icon of lust in the old sense, when old dumb men thought that women were weak and just harlots. She was now stuck permanently in this role, as she sense there was a male version of the icon of lust and that had she got it and put it on along with her icon before it changed her, she would have truly been the icon of lust.<br />
<br />
Well for now she was now want all succubus want to be and their new queen, so she had that going for her despite her unplanned change of sex. <br />
<br />
She somehow sense she has already paid for the stuff she is wearing, so she pondered on what to do. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t get to much time as she felt herself being pulled in a few different directions and realize since she was a succubus now, she could get summoned like one. <br />
<br />
Gabriel thought her options she had before her. She didn&#39;t plan on changing her name for now since she still identifies as her former male self. She then thought she could answer one of the summons for some fun or she could go to her friends and try to convince them she is Gabriel and try and have fun with them.</p>
