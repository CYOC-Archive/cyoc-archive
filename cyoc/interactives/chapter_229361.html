<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;ll join y&#39;all soon.  Right now I&#39;m in the Gender Wing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuki remembered seeing the big sign as she fled into the area.  Looking around, the crowd seemed very normal considering this was a resort centered around transformation.  She supposed that unless someone turned into an animal or inanimate object, though, other transformations wouldn&#39;t stand out.  That is, until she spotted a man with a ballsack hanging from his chin.<br />
<br />
Curious, she took a quick look around at some of the attractions in the wing.  The one nearest the entrance was a set of gender-swapping photo booths, for those who want a quick swap.  Nearby was a clothing store called &quot;New Look, New You&quot;.  Given that the resort altered reality (and clothing) when you transformed, a clothing store for the transformed seemed unnecessary, so it was more likely that the clothes themselves caused transformations.  Past that was what appeared to be a hair salon called &quot;A Little Off the Top&quot;.  But it became apparent that the name was a bit of a misnomer, when someone waltzed out with much more than a haircut -- their entire head had been cleanly snipped off, and reattached to their crotch!<br />
<br />
Yuki knew that the Gender Wing allowed body modifications beyond a gender change, but she didn&#39;t think that the body modifications could be so... kinky.  It got her thinking about the possibilities of her VIP powers, beyond just animal and inanimate transformations.  She already knew it was possible to transform a person into a body part.  She also wondered if maybe there was a public attraction that did the same, perhaps furthur into the Gender Wing.<br />
<br />
Furthur exploration and experimentation would have to wait, though.  She was getting anxious to return to her friends.  Partly because she was glad they weren&#39;t being eaten by a tiger; and partly because, as Josh, they weren&#39;t her friends at all.  Hopefully, despite now having Josh&#39;s mind, she&#39;s still good friends with them.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, as per the settings of the VIP void, Sasha and Maya were indeed still her friends -- the reunion was met with smiles and hugs, and they started chatting like nothing had changed.  And yet, there was something surreal about the reuinion.  There was the obvious: her friends didn&#39;t find it unusual that Yuki now sported a pair of mouse ears, a tail, and claws.  But there was also how the reunion was met.  Yuki had originally arrived here along with her friends, but thanks to the reality alterations made when Josh became her, she had instead arrived here with Andrew.  More importantly, she is now engaged to Andrew, as Josh was.  This thought brought Josh&#39;s memories to the forefront, when he had been dating Andrew-- or rather, Anna.  Yuki remembered the magical night that he had proposed to Anna, under the stars at the zoo.  How appropriate that Anna was now a male tiger, and Yuki had some mousey additions.<br />
<br />
Despite having Yuki&#39;s name and body, these memories and the affection she felt toward Andrew made her realize that she&#39;s as much Josh as she is Yuki.  The idea, then, that she was now bi and attracted to Sasha and Maya seemed perfectly normal, even if there was previously only a sense of companionship when she was just Yuki.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Yuki and Andrew followed Sasha and Maya to their rooms.  For the most part, Josh and Yuki merging did not change the room reservations.  Between the group of six (now five) friends, there were three rooms.  Sasha would have a room to herself until Heather arrived tomorrow morning, at which point they&#39;d be sharing.  But while Yuki was originally going to be rooming with Maya, the fox woman was now going to have a room to herself.<br />
<br />
As Yuki walked along, she marvelled at the feeling of her new mouse tail swaying behind her.  But as she started getting used to the feeling, she also became increasingly aware of her crotch.  Something about the way it felt was distracting.  Given that she had just come from the Gender Wing, she discreetly gave her crotch a quick pat.  Nothing seemed out of the ordinary offhand, but she decided to excuse herself to go to hers and Andrew&#39;s room, leaving the others to unpack.<br />
<br />
Entering her room, she immediately noticed that it no longer resembled an animal enclosure, although there was a pet bed alongside the main bed, and she spotted a covered litterbox in the bathroom, large enough to fit a tiger.  Yuki briefly wondered how Andrew would feel about using that.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how the room changes, though, one thing always remained: the floor-length mirror.  Standing in front of it, Yuki quickly* discarded her clothing.<br />
(*It took a moment to realize that her pants now unbuttoned from over her tail.)<br />
<br />
The short woman in the reflection was one that she recognized.  Small breasts, glasses, braided hair.  The mouse ears, tail, and clawed fingers & toes were new, but she was otherwise still recognizably Yuki.  That included the vagina nestled in her crotch.  As far as she could tell, there was nothing different about it.  So why was her attention drawn to it?<br />
<br />
Looking over the rest of her body, she smiled and cupped her breasts again.  She turned to pose, admiring her curves, and the way the mouse tail draped out over her otherwise human tush.  Despite having lived with this body her whole life, she had a newfound appreciation for it.  It was a cute body, especially with the added mouse features, and she now had this body all to herself.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she realized, she <i>hadn&#39;t</i> had this body her whole life.  Well, technically she did, but that was just one life.  She had also spent life as Josh!<br />
<br />
She reached down and touched her vagina, feeling its lips.  Aside from the odd feeling of her claws scraping it, it felt like the vagina she&#39;s always had as Yuki.  But now she was also feeling it from the perspective of someone who had a penis his whole life.  A penis that she no longer had.<br />
<br />
The ramifications of this merge finally dawned on Yuki.  She has effectively given up being Josh.  She is Yuki.  And not even the same Yuki that she was before.  She was... better?  She likes that she isn&#39;t shy, anymore.  She also likes this body, now more than ever thanks to her male perspective.  By all accounts, she should be furious that a guy would invade her head and change who she was.  Or at least frightened.  But instead, she was strangely happy with this situation.<br />
<br />
That made her wonder, was she going to stay this way?  When she became this new Yuki, she hadn&#39;t considered any long-term plans.  She just wanted a way to get close to her friends, without using her VIP powers as a quick-and-easy cheat.  Granted, she always had those friends as Yuki.  And if she split back to normal, she&#39;d still have her friends as always.  But Josh would be back to square one.  And she didn&#39;t want to ruin this chance for herself.  She still had two more days to spend at the resort, and she intended to make the most of it.  Maybe by the end of the trip, she&#39;ll figure out the best way to split back into two people.  Or maybe, just maybe, she really will give up being Josh, permanently.  Whatever she decides, there will be no turning back once she leaves the resort.<br />
<br />
Idly rubbing her vagina some more, it occurred to her that despite the novelty of no longer having a penis, her vagina was as famliar to her now as it was before gaining Josh&#39;s mind.  This disappointed her a bit, as she had hoped that having a vagina would feel as new as having a pair of mouse ears and a tail.  On the other hand, this also meant that she&#39;s experienced living two different lives, one with a penis and one with a vagina.  Not many people can say that, even at the Transformation Resort.  Heck, because most people leaving the resort forget their old lives, most who leave while genderbent wouldn&#39;t even remember that they were.<br />
<br />
But having lived life as both Josh and Yuki, Yuki wondered which she liked having more: a penis, or a vagina?</p>
