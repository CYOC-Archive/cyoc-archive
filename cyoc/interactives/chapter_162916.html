<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having cleaned up downstairs, they both headed back into Mark&#39;s room. Amy headed straight to the computer and wrote something on it. Mark took a look.<br />
&quot;What next? Well, I would be lying if I said I didn&#39;t find your transformations incredible and entertaining, but with how you are running around, maybe some more fucking?&quot; Mark had a liking for transformations when it came to heroes or villains in comics, cartoons, manga or anime, where they turned into more powerful forms. The form of transformation from Amy was different, but was still fascinating and with what they had done up until now, kinda arousing as well.<br />
Amy thought of his question then lifted one finger on each hand and mixed them together.<br />
&quot;Not quite sure what you are getting at.&quot;<br />
Amy then raised one hand with a finger raised, then the other hand with a finger raised, then put the fingers up against one another.<br />
&quot;Both?&quot;<br />
The latex creature nodded.<br />
&quot;So what to start with? Transforming?&quot; He presented a palm. &quot;Or fucking?&quot; He showed the other.<br />
Amy pointed at the first palm shown.<br />
&quot;Okay then. How bout you go first?&quot;<br />
Amy jumped up and went into the bag of slowly reducing items. It pulled out some small mitts. Then it motioned to Mark to remove his pants as it struggled to put on the gloves.<br />
&quot;Wait, I thought we weren&#39;t-&quot; Amy repeated the motion. &quot;Okay, I just don&#39;t get.&quot;<br />
Mark pulled down his pants, and his underwear as well, his dick having gotten erect for obvious reasons. Amy finished struggling with the mitts and wrapped both hands around his dick. Then the gloves fused with her body. Once done her mitten-like hands were locked around Mark&#39;s dick. She tried to pull them off, but couldn&#39;t.<br />
&quot;Guess we are stuck for a bit.&quot; Mark said.<br />
Amy solved the issue by morphing its hands back to normal and released its grip.<br />
&quot;You could just have moved them over the tip, you know.&quot; Amy morphed one hand into the mitten form and started making a dick stroking gesture. &quot;Yeah, I get it.&quot;<br />
Amy was giggling to itself, then pointed to the bag for Marks turn.<br />
<br />
Mark looked and pulled out some angel wings. He remembered that Amy had this as a halloween costume a few years ago. &quot;Want your wings?&quot; Amy nodded. &quot;Do you also have some demon wings?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Aww, then I don&#39;t get my demon doll.&quot; Mark said with a fake annoyed tone. &quot;Wait... Is this a horse costume?&quot; He pulled the white horse costume out. Or the body half of it.<br />
Amy took the costume and looked at it. It had an opening for the front person to place the head part of the costume, and an opening along the horse&#39;s back for both wearers to enter. The doll got an idea. Although, wings first.<br />
Mark fastened the wings to make sure they were strapped on correctly, and the plastic feathers straightened before Amy absorbed them. The wings connected with her back as the straps faded into her body. Mark was in awe of the creature standing before him, although one thing bothered him. &quot;Shame your wings turned black.&quot;<br />
Amy agreed with Mark. It looked over its shoulders to see the black wings and just wished they would be the white they originally were. Then on cue the wings turned to their original color.<br />
&quot;How did you do that?&quot; Mark asked bewildered. <br />
Amy just shrugged, then got an idea. It thought of the wings as black and they turned black again. It could see that Mark was catching on as well. Then it thought of them becoming the blue that its eyes had been. Nothing. Wanting to test it fully, Amy brought back its eyes and gestured at Mark to look at them. Then it wanted the eyes to become the blue they once had, and they turned. Or at least, they did if Marks reaction was anything to go by. For a hot second it morphed its mouth to a human one, smiled, then formed it back to a fuckhole and removed the eyes. &quot;Horse time!&quot; it thought.<br />
<br />
Amy crawled into the suit and popped its head out where the horse mask would be, turned around and closed the opening on the back. It then motioned to Mark for some scissors. <br />
Mark not questioning the madness happening inside of Amy&#39;s head complied right away, though he was sure she had a good reason for that. He was proven correct when she made a hole for her pussy to be visible. Then she gestured to Mark to take the rear and hold them up. This Mark was more clear on as to why and held it in a way so that the legs was resting on the floor. Amy took a few steps forward, stretching the costume before it slowly turned latex and black.<br />
Amy looked as the costume sealed around it, the opening behind it creeping up and sealed itself just above its ass. Meanwhile its pussy hole was displayed proudly as the costume was absorbed around it. It looked down at the feet which shaped into proper latex hooves. &quot;Guess the latex can also recognize context.&quot; the latex girl thought. Then it looked behind it as the body formed and corrected any fold in the cloth that might have been to make the body consistently smooth all the way to the back. As the latex reached the end and started going down the hind legs, the doll&#39;s &#39;assistant&#39; let go as the legs finalized. Amy was now a centaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel?&quot; Mark was curious. <br />
Amy responded with rubbing its arms up and down its new horse back. Then it walked in a small circle around itself. &quot;This movement feels oddly natural.&quot; it thought to itself, but knew it was thanks to the magic latex... probably.<br />
&quot;You know what, Amy?&quot; Mark then piped up. &quot;That face just looks...&quot; he paused for a second. &quot;It looks wrong like that.&quot;<br />
Amy tried to picture itself and agreed. There was something uncanny about a centaur with the bald fuckhole-only head that it had. It morphed in some eyes, its nose and changed the mouth back to normal. It then made a hair gesture and pointed at the bag.<br />
&quot;The wig I presume?&quot; Mark asked, with the centaur nodding. He quickly dived in, found the wig and tossed it to the horse-girl. Amy put on the blonde long-haired wig and absorbed it. The black latex slowly moving down the hair strands as it reached the tips that were laying along Amy&#39;s horseback. Just as the tips were black the hair returned to the original blonde color, if still consisting of latex. Mark thought it complimented her blue eyes.<br />
&quot;So, a question. Can I mount you?&quot; Mark asked. <br />
The latex centaur walked to the computer and wrote &#39;You want to mount me some more already?&#39; and imitated giggling as Mark read what it had written.<br />
&quot;Real funny. Can I take you for a ride?&quot; he asked annoyed.<br />
The centaur wrote something on the computer again, before stepping back while fanning itself.<br />
&quot;You can ride me anytime.&quot; He looked at the centaur, back at what she had written, then back at her again. &quot;Any way I can say this WITHOUT you making a sex joke?&quot; Amy just shook her head in response. &quot;Then just... Just grab the head if you are just gonna be horsing around.&quot; Mark was defeated.<br />
Amy chuckled to itself as it pulled the horse head out of the large plastic bag. It was getting pretty empty with some cosmetics and a few other clothing articles. Still plenty to experiment with, but using anything for stuffing was a no-go situation now. The latex centaur took a look at the mask and noticed the bent horn on the forehead. &quot;Unicorn.&quot; Amy thought. &quot;That explains why the costume wasn&#39;t the stereotypical brown. Speaking of.&quot; The latex creature concentrated and the horse part of it turned the white of the horse costume. Amy liked the contrast between its two colors. It reverted the colors back and prepared for putting the head on.<br />
Mark looked as Amy put on the mask and stumbled to the computer, her two hands popping up from under the mask and wrote something on the computer. &quot;Horn?&quot; He looked at the forehead and saw the mentioned part. &quot;I will see if I can find something to mend it.&quot; He walked out and broke off a small dead branch from one of the house plants. Then he went back to his room and picked up the duct tape. He snapped the branch in half and had the two stumps on either side placed along the bent part of the horn. After having the horn straightened with the branches he put some tape around it, and the horn was standing proudly, despite the amateur fix. &quot;Alright, all fixed up.&quot; he proclaimed. An arm appeared again from under the mask and pointed at the screen before disappearing again. &quot;Remember to pet the horse and stroke its horn.&quot; He turned around. &quot;Is that an innuendo?&quot; He could see some movement under the mask, but couldn&#39;t tell what it was. &quot;Fine, keep your secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
The unicorn made some strange facial movement before allowing Mark to approach. He was quick to gently stroke her along the face the same way he had seen in movies and shows. He did it for a minute before switching to the horn. It was rather mundane. It didn&#39;t feel any special and Amy wasn&#39;t reacting in any certain way. The only thing of interest was despite the horn looking relatively pointy, it was effectively harmless, with the horn being slightly bendy from the upper half. With that done, Mark tickled Amy behind the ear and stepped away. <br />
&quot;Anything else you want stroked?&quot;<br />
The unicorn shook its head before slowly reverting back into a centaur, Amy looking just as disappointed as Mark. It wrote something on the computer and emoted a sigh.<br />
&quot;That was disappoi- Yeah, it really was. Unicorns are only really special if they are magical, I guess.&quot; Mark didn&#39;t even have to finish reading the note.<br />
Amy stepped forward and wrote again. &#39;But I am magical, or what else would you call this latex crap?&#39;<br />
&quot;I mean, magical in their own way. Argh, you know what I mean.&quot; Mark replied after reading the note.<br />
&#39;Well, I have one thing left to test out I think you would like. Then maybe after that, a living sex doll could have some more fun with you? Or perhaps we could empty the bag. Not much left.&#39; Amy wrote.<br />
Mark raised an eyebrow after reading it. With a smile Amy made a gesture as all four hooves turned into its tipped feet and its legs got more human in appearance, showing off its sexy thighs. Meanwhile its horse ass also took shape of the large spheres belonging to the latex doll form. Once the changes were done, it took its small round again. &quot;Oh yeah, this form feels great.&quot;<br />
Mark looked mesmerized at the centaur like creature. There was something about it that just hit the right spot on the &#39;hot-or-not-o-meter&#39; for him. He didn&#39;t even notice that Amy was writing something on the computer before she poked him on the shoulder. He took a look and laughed. &quot;Yeah, it is. If only the neighbors weren&#39;t so nosy in what we do in our garden. You are pretty stuck in here.&quot; He said the last statement with a concerned tone.<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll figure something out I hope&#39; Amy wrote as a response.<br />
&quot;Well then.&quot; Mark then said. &quot;You were offering some suggestions, and I think what to do next.&quot;</p>
