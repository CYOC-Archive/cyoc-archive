<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hallway was clear with no sign of either stuffs, patients or even security guards, being a perfect path for Andrew and Henry to make their escape, and with little time left before the cameras become reactive. The duo travel down the hall in search of a exist that was located just down the hall, but Andrew became curious when the Henry used his serum on Rick and wonder if he was alright now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Doc...&quot; Henry place his finger on his lips to keep him quietly; they are not being seen, but they can still be heard by other people who may be around the corners. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but now that you injected your serum on Rick, what going to happen to him now? is he going to be alright?&quot; Henry look around the corner to be certain that no one was around and to his joy had also found the exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I kind predict what will happen, thought it will be 90% accuracy, but could still come true. Right now his body is slowly becoming what he and you always want him to be, a female were-cheetah. However, I should tell you that the serum does more than change gender.&quot; Andrew was confuse by what had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That serum was one of the many experiments me and my former scientist&#39;s attempt to understand the origin and transformation of were-beast. Our main focus was to see if we can create new kind of species of were-beast; the first was were-gorilla, later was also lizards and birds. Soon afterward he even started creating a super serum on a human who is about to become a were-beast, which is deign to alter the DNA and make the new were-beast stronger, faster and even highly intelligent than all of it other kind. It was then that we work together to create a ultimate version of were-beast; a were-hybrid.&quot; Andrew was shock at what he heard, trying to certain that he did not image what he just heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;A were-hybrid? As in trying to make a were-beast from different parts or forms of animals?&quot; The doc look again and still no one was still around.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are correct. This were-hybrid was design to became the most advance and ultimate form of all were-beast&#39;s, with the strength and traits of all animals. Unfortunately, the test subject became unstable due to the different genes of animals and became savage, unstoppable killing machine. It took every strength and number of guards just to bring it down, the our &quot;superiors&quot; wanted to keep it alive and lock it away instead of putting an end to it. Soon after that event, I decided to look through the possibilities of making a were-beast change gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But as you can guess, my superiors did not agree with me leaving the hybrid project and demanded me to start working on it again. When I refuse, they first kick me out of my work station, then attempt taking everything I have been working so long, but I would rather die then let them take all I have done. Before they were able to get all of my works, I took as much of my experiments, including the hybrid project researches, then I have been on the run over the years since that day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what about the serum you used? I only thought it was just meant to change gender, but you said it does more than that?&quot; Andrew almost let out a shout of anger at Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I started to create a method to make were-best change gender during my time at the lab, all of my subject had prove failures and none could change genders. It was while I was on the run that my formula was still missing some key components, but soon found the solution in my super serum. I mix the two of them to create this improve serum; not only will this serum make him a female were-beast, but will also make him far more powerful than any were-cheetah. However I fear that there maybe some side-effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what kind of side-effect!?&quot; Henry tried his best to make Andrew stay calm and silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first would be, as I witness, a new personality is starting to be created, as I saw him speaking to himself while he was sleepy. This mean that this persona will be the &quot;female version&quot; of ick, which I can take the guess of being much smarter, more determine and even lustful than the original Rick. The second is how Rick transform; in exchange for that kind of new strength,the two persona&#39;s will have no control of switching between themselves. The were-beast can only remain about 12 hours (mostly on night-time) before his human form resurface, only by the next 12 hour Rick turn back into his were-beast.  Also to be noted, when this were-beast persona take control, the other persona will be put to sleep, and the vice-versa. This way they will no longer even need to go to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Henry clock began to make beeping sound, altering him that the time is nearly up. &quot;We have no time to explain this anymore, we must go now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry run toward the door, but just as he was at inches close to the door handle, a voice appear behind him. &quot;Stop right there!&quot; Henry stood still, as the old security guard was pointing his stun gun right at him. &quot;Now turn around right now. How did you get inside this part of the building without getting seen by...&quot; As Henry made a slow turn around, the security guard expression was slowly trning in complete shock, as if he had seen a ghost.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way...That impossible! Is that you, Doctor Henry!?&quot; Henry could only laugh, seeing the person in front of him like an old friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if my eyes deceive me, it seem little old John now all grow up. How have you been John?&quot; John was having hard problem listening to Henry, for he was still shock at what was right in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be! You been gone for 60 years and been reported to be dead. So why are you still here, even more so how could you still look the same the day you run away!?&quot; Henry tried not to talk about it, yet he couldn&#39;t help by laugh at the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t talk much about myself, and even more importantly you should keep this conversation to yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why should I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if they found out you were talking to me, they going to make certain you will never see the light of day again. It for you best interest that you keep you mouth shut about talking to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Henry...you were a good man and it was a great honor being your bodyguard. But now I must turn you in, you have commit a crime against this town and I must do my duty. I&#39;m sorry Henry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about this too John.&quot; John didn&#39;t understand what he meant before Andrew appear behind him and hitting him hard on the head, leaving John unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Henry, shouldn&#39;t have wasted the time talking about Rick condition.&quot; Henry look down at the poor sleepy John, feeling sad that it had to be this way. &quot;And what should we do with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to do anything; chances are he would not remember this event, and even if he did, I don&#39;t think he would do something stupid as risking his life. Even so, I must stay hidden here for another few weeks till the heat dies down. Come now, we better get out of here before anymore trouble comes to us.&quot; The duo open the door and exist the building.</p>
