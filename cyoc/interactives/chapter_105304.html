<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... would you like to go out?&quot; Frances asked to Samantha as they finished the last of the pizza.<br />
<br />
It was delicious, though Frances had no real idea how Moe got his shop up and running so quickly, as his family had only moved to town shortly after Yvette&#39;s arrest, which wasn&#39;t that long ago. Maybe he had made some calls for prep work to be done before hand or had REALLY good suppliers that followed his progress closely. Regardless, it was good, and Frances had supposed that was all that mattered. Dimaggios might lose some business because of how good Moe&#39;s pizza was, but the two made two totally different styles, which might work out for both of them in the end.<br />
<br />
The issue at the moment though, wasn&#39;t so much the pizza, but their plans for the night and early evening. Frances had originally had a nice walk and dinner planned, but settled on pizza when it was clear that Samantha had had a stressful day. It wasn&#39;t that they couldn&#39;t go out, as unless there was a major emergency, Samantha didn&#39;t HAVE to go in on a Sunday. But if Samantha was still frustrated by the stresses of the day, it wasn&#39;t likely that she&#39;d want to go for walk. What they would do would depend entirely on Samantha&#39;s answer to the question that Frances had just asked. Frances watched as Samantha gave a heavy sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think it best to stay,&quot; Samantha sighed heavily, &quot;a walk would be nice... but I&#39;m a bit beat by all the excitement that went on today. Maybe tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances slowly nodded, &quot;then how about a nice bath. It&#39;ll work out all that stress... and there are a few things I could try that might help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha watched her wife and raised an eyebrow slowly and then shook her head and gave a small laugh, &quot;Okay, a nice warm bath then. If you want to get it started, I can clean up here. I&#39;m not so tired that I can&#39;t clean up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded and got up, and Samantha watched her wife head back toward their bedroom and thus their master bathroom that was attached to it. After Frances disappeared from view, Samantha set about putting the pizza boxes away as well as the plates that she and Frances had used. What was trash went in the kitchen trashcan or just inside the garage where it could go to their bigger dumpster that was in the garage. Samantha figured she could deal with that stuff the next day. Dishes that would need to be washed were placed in the sink and Samantha even ran some water to rinse off the worst of it. In the process of this, she heard water starting to run in main bathroom, which meant that Frances was getting the bath ready.<br />
<br />
Once the last of the dinner clean up was done, Samantha made her own way to her bedroom and then to her bathroom. As she went through both buildings, she found Frances&#39; clothes laying on the floor just outside the master bathroom. She also noted that the lights weren&#39;t on in the master bathroom. Light did flicker but it was softer than the electric lights. Samantha slowly entered with some sense of intrigue as she noticed this and found Frances seated inside their shared bathtub. The bathtub was full, but there also was a mountain of foam in the tub with Frances. She sat erect in the tub and the bubbles came high enough that they were just below her breasts. She&#39;d also raised some of the bubbles so that small globs of soap bubbles rested on her nipples. The bigger thing, though, was that Frances had candles set up on some of the higher levels in the tub/shower area and on bathroom counter. Samantha didn&#39;t need the candle light to see, as her werecat vision worked perfectly and she could see a warm and playful smile on her wife&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to join me, beautiful?&quot; Frances asked from the tub, her smile as clear as the nose on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would love to,&quot; Samantha smiled and began disrobing as well.<br />
<br />
Frances continued to smile as Samantha disrobed and threw her clothing out into the bedroom. Samantha had to be careful not to hit anything that might upset the candles that Frances had set up, as it appeared that her wife had something romantic planned. It wasn&#39;t long before she threw her underwear safely into bedroom and stood totally naked in front of her wife. Frances only smiled some more and raised a hand from the water and flicked her pointer finger so as to draw Samantha into the tub. Samantha returned the smile and decided to play along.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you don&#39;t have anything dirty planned,&quot; Samantha said to her as she calmly stepped into the tub, almost purring at the feeling of the warm water and the bubbles as her skin touched them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course there&#39;s nothing dirty,&quot; Frances answered playfully as she watched Samantha carefully lower herself into the tub. Frances soon felt her wife&#39;s legs slide beside and over her legs. &quot;We&#39;re immersed in bubbles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Samantha said softly, enjoying the feeling of the water touching her skin, which did feel lovely.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I just wanted to show you that I love you,&quot; Frances spoke as she reached up and collected the soft loofah that hung from a hook one the wall beside them. &quot;I will always love you and I will NEVER have a problem. It doesn&#39;t matter what were I became. I would always love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Samantha answered as she rolled some water and soap suds up from the bath and to get the water to slide over her body She ended up rising up a little so that she could turn around and move to sit beside Frances who was soaking the loofah in the soapy water. &quot;And as I said I have no regrets about our relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet you continue to think you did something wrong,&quot; Frances spoke with some concern, remembering their earlier conversation, &quot;you didn&#39;t. Really.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha couldn&#39;t help but smile as she looked to Frances who reached out with the soapy loofah and let the soft bath sponge slide over her skin. It felt divine as Frances&#39; touch was as soft and gentle as it had always been. As loofah slid over Samantha&#39;s breasts, she did her best avoid giving a bit of a moan as Frances did her best to make sure that she hit the portions of her wife&#39;s mammary glands that were particularly sensitive  and Frances also made sure to actually pleasure her wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did everything right,&quot; Frances assured Samantha and pulled the other werecat into a hug, which Samantha returned, &quot;and if it takes me four centuries, I will get you understand that you did everything right...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha smiled and kissed Frances with love and passion, &quot;and if our four centuries are anything like what we&#39;ve had together so far... there will be NO complaints from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them kissed again, glad to be comfortable but above all, glad to be together.</p>
