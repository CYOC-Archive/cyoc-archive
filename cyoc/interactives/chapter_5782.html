<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Aren’t there any other choices?”  I ask in desperation.<br />
<br />
“Well, there is the Magic Forest, it’s where I’m headed as soon as I get out of here.  It’s a place I’ve heard of and discovered the path to.  A satyr told me about it and I think I’d like to go there.  Best of all fates, I suppose, becoming a satyr; sex, food and wine, what more could you ask, eh sonny?” the man.  “By the way, the name’s Gus an’ I’d be happy to lead you to that path to the Magical Forest.”<br />
<br />
“I think I’d like that.”  I said.<br />
<br />
“’course, the satyr said there’s a fork in the path that leads to what’s called the Druid’s Grove.  He said that the Druids there can teach you how to shift your body into any form you choose and back to human if you like.  You could become an oak or a stallion or anything.  When we come to the fork in that road, you’ll make your choice.”  Gus said.<br />
<br />
“OK, then let’s go.”  I said.<br />
<br />
I followed Gus out of the reeking restroom and we quickly went behind the building.  I was growing somewhat attached to the large man.  We ducked into some bushes just in time, a coachman had just come around behind the building.  He dropped his pants and began to take a piss, preferring the back of the building to the stale reek of the building itself.  After a satisfied grunt, he pulled up his pants and left.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s safe now.”  Gus whispered in my ear and a thrill of excitement at his gruff voice shivered down my spine.<br />
<br />
“OK, where do we go now?”  I asked.<br />
<br />
“Well have to make a break for those trees.”  Gus pointed to a small stand of trees about a hundred yards away.  “It’s about noon, the path only reveals itself when the sun is directly overhead, at least this particular path does.  Once were on it, no coachman can follow.  The satyr said other paths reveal themselves only by the light of a full moon, but we’re not waitin’ that long.  We’ll know it when we see it, there’s white flagstones that lead into the Magical Forest.”  Gus said with a grin.<br />
<br />
We made a dash for the stand of trees.  My changing feet betrayed me almost half way there and the cry I let out drew attention to us as I fell flat on my face.  Three coachmen approached from what seemed out of no where.  I scrambled to get up and was suddenly hoisted in the air and found myself thrown over the huge fat man’s shoulder like a sack of onions.<br />
<br />
Gus grabbed me up, yelling curses over his shoulder at the three who were chasing the both of us.  We reached the stand of trees and Gus quickly found the white flagstones.  As he ran down the first three I saw them shimmer behind us and begin to fade.  The coachmen stopped at the first stone and refused to follow.  Gus dropped me to the ground, turned around and flipped them off, unzipped his pants and waived his huge donkey cock at them.<br />
<br />
“Fuck off you bastards!  You don’t dare enter this place, Uncle Buck would make you his butt boys if you did and you know it!”  Gus taunted.  The coachmen cursed and Gus dropped his pants and mooned them.<br />
<br />
“Uh… Gus… the stones are starting to disappear!”  I said, looking at the white stones.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!”  Gus said.  He pulled up his pants and threw me over his shoulder again.  I could see that as the stones vanished, the coachmen could follow, but they had to wait until a stone disappeared before they could move further down the path.  The stones began to vanish more quickly and the coachmen were beginning to catch us.  Gus ran as fast as he could and leapt over the last stone in the path just as it was fading.  We stood in the midst of an old growth forest and all around us were what looked to be ancient greet columns, overgrown with ivy.  The path had vanished and the coachmen had been left behind in some other place.<br />
<br />
Gus dropped me to my feet and in the next instant grabbed me in a great bear hug.  I looked up into his face, he was completely human again.<br />
<br />
“We made it!”  He said.<br />
<br />
“Gus, you’re back to being human again.”  I said.<br />
<br />
He reached up and felt his face and smiled.  He had about three weeks of salt and pepper beard on his squared face, but it was an ordinary face.<br />
Gus smiled, “It seems the effects of donkey beer wear off here.  You still look like you’re part donkey, but you look less donkey than you did when we made our run for it.  Come on, we need to get on that path.”  Gus said.<br />
<br />
“But, if you changed back into a man, and I’m going to change back, why don’t we just leave?”  I asked.<br />
<br />
“Because we can’t; like it or not were here on Pleasure Island and one of the fates await us.  If you were to find a way back to where we just came from, I expect that you would just fall prey to the donkey beer or something else; at least in the Magic Forest or the Druid Grove you get a choice.  Besides, we came here to enjoy ourselves, didn’t we?  Imagine living as a satyr, makin’ love to nymphs or other satyrs all day and reveling all night?  If you choose the Druid grove, they may accept you and you could learn shape shifting into any living form you choose.  It could be a dream come true, either path you take.  Think about it on the way there and decide when we reach the fork, OK?”  Gus said.  “By the way, what is your name?  I don’t want to just keep callin’ you sonny.”<br />
<br />
My name is Harold, but most people just call me Harry.  Well Harry, it’s nice to have you along.  I’m glad we both got away from that life of pure drudgery and torture.<br />
<br />
Gus quickly found the path and we walked all afternoon.  By sundown, I had reverted completely to my human form.<br />
<br />
“We better think about food and some sleep.  The satyr said it was a long journey and it would take us until noon of the second day to reach the fork, with a rest overnight.  He said we could safely sleep in the forest, but that pixies and fairies occasionally flitted about and teased sleeping travelers.  Don’t wander too far from the path and call out to me often, OK Harry?”  Gus asked.<br />
<br />
I nodded and we both explored the area around the path.<br />
<br />
About a half an hour later Gus and I met in a small clearing a few yards from the path.  Each of us had gathered some grapes a few apples some pears and Gus had manage to find figs.  After eating we sat and talked about what had brought us to the island.  Gus was looking for wild drunken sexual pleasures, things he’d never experienced before.  I told him that I was seeking the same, but that I could do with less of the drunkenness.  He chuckled and looked at me in a lustful way.<br />
<br />
“How ‘bout we explore some of those pleasures now, after all, we’re here alone and the residual effects of the beer seems to be hightened desire.”  Gus growled, lustfully.<br />
<br />
He placed a huge, meaty hand on my inner thigh and squeezed gently on my rock hard cock that had grown down my pant leg.  I opened my mouth in a moan and he kissed me deeply.  Before I knew it, we were both naked and Gus was mounting me.  His huge cock gently pushed into me and he softly grunted as he worked is full ten inches as deeply as he could into my ass.  This wasn’t anything new to me, except for his size.  It was a bit painful, but I managed.  I still hadn’t come when I felt Gus explode.  He rubbed his huge hairy chest and stomach all over my back and slowly pulled out.  He lay, panting, on his back and then it was my turn.  I rolled him over, spread his hairy ass and pushed my cock into him.  He apparently wasn’t a stranger to this either and was moaning in pleasure as my rock hard eight inch pole massaged his prostate.  I ran my fingers through the hair on his back as I fucked the huge stud.  Gus came a second time as I shot my seed into him.  The spasms of his asshole milked my cock of all it had to give.  I pulled out of my big furry partner and we collapsed in a sweaty heap, kissing.  The night was warm and we lay in the grass on top of our clothes with Gus cuddled up close behind me.<br />
<br />
In the morning, we woke with the sound of birds.  We kissed and dressed and set out on the path after gather a little more fruit for breakfast.<br />
<br />
At about noon we reached the fork in the road.<br />
<br />
“The Magic Forest is to the right and the Druid Grove is to the left, have you thought about the way you want to go, Harry?”  Gus asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, and I think I want to go to the Druid Grove.  Have you decided?”  I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yep!  I think I want to be a satyr or a centaur or perhaps a minotaur.”  He said with a big grin.<br />
<br />
We embraced, kissed and waved as we each headed down our separate paths.<br />
<br />
I was walking down the sunlit forest path.  It was mid afternoon and I was enjoying the walk.  I stopped and listened.  I heard something crashing down the path behind me.  I didn’t know what to expect so I hid in some dense ferns.  About three minutes later, Gus ran by on the path grunting out, “Damn that little fucker is fast!”  I jumped out onto the road behind Gus and called out.  He was about thirty feet ahead of me.<br />
<br />
“Gus!”  He stopped, turned and ran back to me.  He caught me up in his big strong arms and spun me around, kissing me all over my face.  <br />
<br />
“Harry!  I thought about it and I just couldn’t go on without you.  In all my life, I’ve never had as much pleasure or felt as good as I did last night.  I realized that your path was my path too, so I want to come with you.”  He beamed down at me.  “I want to spend the rest of my days with you, where ever you go.”<br />
<br />
I hugged the big man back.  “So do I, Gus, so do I.”<br />
<br />
We headed down the path to the Druid Grove, Gus’ big meaty harm around my shoulders and by arm around his waist.  Occasionally, my had would wander down and caress his ass and he would stop and give me a kiss.  Night was coming on and we’d have to stop for sleep… well, we’d sleep… eventually.</p>
