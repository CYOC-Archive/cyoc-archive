<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">** link below is to the seating chart I made for a reference. And a quick side note: panther is just a generic term for jaguar or leopard. Technically there's no such thing as a werepanther, but since the term has been established I'm running with it - bj88<br />
<br />
<br />
“Thanks Mrs. Anderson, but I should get back home. My mom’s probably wondering why I’m not already there. Thank you for the offer, enjoy your evening.” Julie said. She took a quick look around the room, her eyes settling on the two faces she didn’t recognize. <br />
<br />
“Must be Spencer’s parents.” she thought, noting the similarities between the three. Julie bowed out, secretly licking her lips and savoring the lingering tastes. The strong smells Julie was exuding didn’t go unnoticed by any of the weres present. Martha and William exchanged a worried look, and asked Nate to go check on Eric. Nate bounded up the stairs and knocked on his brother’s door.<br />
<br />
“Hey Eric, you okay in there?” he asked, the smells from downstairs only stronger upstairs.<br />
<br />
“I… ya I guess.” Eric replied, dealing with some serious blue balls right now. <br />
<br />
Julie left him on the cusp of release. Then she stopped and left, which left Eric very confused and sporting quite the hard on. He tried finishing what she started, but his hands weren’t doing the job. And now Nate was outside his bedroom. There was no way in hell he was going to play with himself with his brother ten feet away.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure? I know Julie just left. And, well to be frank, she kinda smelled like… sex.” Nate admitted. <br />
<br />
The worst case scenario Nate was playing out in his head was that Julie forced herself on Eric. Best case, Eric agreed and was now cleaning up. The actual situation was far from either. Eric, finally having conquered his unpleasant erection, opened the door. The smells inside hit Nate like a brick wall. As did the fact that Eric was standing in his boxers, with a huge wet spot on the front. <br />
<br />
“What happened?” Nate asked, suddenly more worried than he had been before. Eric’s face was a mix of shame, confusion, and (given the atmosphere), excitement. His cheeks were seriously flushed. <br />
<br />
“Nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Eric, come on, don’t lie. Did you and Julie… you know?” <br />
<br />
“No! No, we’d never! I mean, while everyone’s downstairs and…” Eric got so flustered Nate thought his brother was going to start crying. <br />
<br />
“Okay, relax man. Relax,” Nate said, “I had to ask didn’t I? If you two didn’t do IT, what happened? She didn’t try to force you into it, did she?”<br />
<br />
“No, it’s nothing like that. I mean I don’t think so. I… I don’t know.” Eric sighed. He didn’t know how to explain his current predicament. Telling him that she wanted him to make a serious commitment was one thing. Telling his brother that the reason for all the strong scents was that Julie was giving him a blowjob was another. <br />
<br />
“Don’t sweat it bro, we can talk about it later.” Nate said, patting Eric’s back. Eric appreciated his brother’s discretion, and grabbed a clean pair of pants. The two rejoined the others, who were exchanging stories. Maggie and Samantha were catching up, reminiscing about their high school experiences. <br />
<br />
“Eric, are you alright?” Martha asked upon seeing him and Nate enter the dining room.<br />
<br />
“I’m okay. Sorry I took so long.” he said. He looked around the room, eyes stopping once they find Spencer. The erection he’s managed to contain is now making a comeback. Thankfully it stops when Eric’s eyes met Evan Lawson’s. The fear he’s feeling quickly kills his arousal, and Eric takes a seat across from Nate, and beside his mother and Alex. Spencer watches him with particular interest. <br />
<br />
“Did he and Julie get into a fight? But then, why would she be stinking up the place? Maybe it’s like angry sex,” Spencer thought. Eric was clearly flustered about something, and the list of possible reasons was as long as the state of California. <br />
<br />
“So, are you settling in okay? I’m sure Moon Lake is a change compared to Virginia.” Martha said.<br />
<br />
“It’s a change for the better. And I’m glad to be home again. I’d spent so much time away from this place, I forgot how much I missed it.” Maggie said, glancing at Samantha with a sly grin on her face. Samantha stifled back a giggle. <br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind my asking Evan, how does being in the military work for a were? It must be difficult at times.” William asked, genuinely curious as to how the werewolf manages such a dangerous, and secretive job, without anyone finding out. <br />
<br />
“Actually there are more enlisted weres than you might think. I think the numbers are for every twenty or so soldiers you meet, one is a were, or knows of our existence. I was lucky to meet a were-friendly recruiter, so he introduced me to the right people.” Evan said. <br />
<br />
“Do you still have to do all the training and stuff like the normal recruits?” Nate asked. <br />
<br />
“Not exactly. They sort out of the normals and were after you get to RTC. But otherwise, the exercises and drills are exactly the same. A little tougher since weres are, generally speaking, more physically fit than normal people.”<br />
<br />
“How’d you end up a SEAL?” Nate asks, growing more an more interested by the second. His family were just as surprised as they had been when they found out Nate had a “thing” for werewolves when they first moved here. While Evan is explaining how he recruited, and the various kinds of training he received, Martha asks Eric if anything happened between him and Julie.<br />
<br />
“Nothing like that.” he said, trying to keep his voice down. But Spencer can still hear him. But the fact that Julie left with quite the smile on her face, and Eric smells like all kinds of yummy things tells her that something did transpire between the two. <br />
<br />
“Foreplay?” she wondered, trying not to let her fantasies get the better of her. If she got turned on in front of her father, she’d never hear the end of it. <br />
<br />
“How long have you and Julie been dating?” Spencer asks Eric. <br />
<br />
“Um, I don’t know. A couple of months. Our first date was around the 4th of July.” Eric said, remembering their rather intense first date. Against his better judgement, he let Julie talk him into going with her folks to the coast. While he couldn’t engage in some of the more were based activities (i.e swimming to San Diego for the afternoon), he and Julie did spend a lot of time making out in the ocean. Thankfully no normal people paid them much attention. Otherwise they might have caught a glimpse of Julie’s tail. <br />
<br />
“It’s not serious, is it?” Spencer pressed.<br />
<br />
“Not exactly. I mean she wants it to be serious, but… I don’t know what I want to do yet.” Eric admitted. <br />
<br />
“And you’re a complete dunce when it comes to women.” Nate added, having finished his conversation with Evan. <br />
<br />
“Am not!” Eric protested.<br />
<br />
“Ya, you kinda are.” Nate snickered.<br />
<br />
“You’re one to talk. You can’t even keep a girl’s attention for more than a few seconds.”<br />
<br />
“And your idea of a date is going to a the movies to see a documentary on krill.” <br />
<br />
“Knock it off you two. You want to fight like toddlers, I’ll get out the play pen and you can have it out in there.” William scolded his sons. William tries to apologize, but Maggie assures him it’s alright. <br />
<br />
“Please, my sister and I used to get into cat fights over dinner all the time. And I mean actual cat fights,” she said, then turned to Samantha, “Remember that time she threw a bowl of pasta at my head?” <br />
<br />
“It’s hard not to. You went to our junior prom covered in spaghetti sauce. That certainly was a ‘night to remember’. I’ve still got the pictures to prove it.” Samantha laughed. <br />
<br />
“You and your sister didn’t get along when you were younger?” Martha asked.<br />
<br />
“It was really just typical sibling rivalry stuff. It’s a bit different for weres. Hair pulling and name calling often escalate to tailing grabbing and hissing. Which was made all the more serious since we aren’t domestic werecats.” <br />
<br />
“Samantha said you were a subspecies of Asian leopard.” Francis commented.<br />
<br />
“Yes. To be specific, an Indo-Chinese leopard. And don’t bother asking how we ended up such a specific species, I haven’t a clue. Somewhere along the way one of my grandparents must have mixed their African leopard with the Asian, and come up with this.” Maggie said, pointing to her own body.<br />
<br />
“Which must make for an interesting mix when you throw werewolf DNA into the pool.” Samantha adds. The only ones aware of Spencer’s hybrid were status are Samantha and Nate. Granted the other weres could tell Spencer was different, they didn’t know how different. And poor Eric was completely in the dark, as Nate hadn’t bothered to tell him, or his parents about Spencer. It was her secret to tell, not his. <br />
<br />
“I’m a hybrid.” Spencer explains. The confused faces around the room are quickly replaced with surprised and mystified ones. <br />
<br />
“That is so cool!” Alex said, longingly. His parents were also an inter-species couple, a werewolf and a werefox. But he’s taken after his father, rather than end up a wolfox (his own term for a wolf-fox mix). <br />
<br />
“I was wondering what your scent was. I just assumed you smelled like both since your parents are a werewolf and werepanthress.” Ben said.<br />
<br />
Eric feels a little left out and the others discuss were things. It brings him back to Julie, who is eager for the two to start being physical. He isn’t ready to make the change to were yet, but it certainly wouldn’t hurt to start researching the possibilities. Once again, his eyes stop at Spencer. Picturing her transformed, black and gray fur if she’s more wolf or completely black with subtle spots if she’s more leopard, is quite the image.</p>
