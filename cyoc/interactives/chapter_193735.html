<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having sensed Clark’s wishes and desires during the first day while it was being worn by Clark, the magical garment decided to grant all of Clark’s wishes, one at a time. During the second day, it had boosted Clark’s leg muscles dramatically, injecting him with crazy soccer skills and an intense desire to play soccer, transforming the short, shy, and skinny kid into an amazing soccer jock. <br />
<br />
Now that Clark had spent his first day on the soccer pitch, scoring several goals and assists using his jacked-up legs, the jacket decided to take things a little farther. Since Clark had his first soccer game on Saturday, where he scored the winning goal, he wanted to spend the day with family on Sunday. <br />
<br />
Clark’s parents too him to church early on Sunday morning, where he got to wear the magical jacket during the entire service. Afterwards, the family went to a crowded steakhouse for lunch, and Clark only removed the jacket briefly during the meal. After lunch, he put it on again as the family decided to walk around the crowded shopping mall since it was the week before Christmas. <br />
<br />
Once again, Clark wandered into the sporting goods store where he admired the weightlifting equipment, which excited him greatly. The boy stopped and imagined himself as a young teenage bodybuilder as he stood in the sports store, glancing over at the barbells and the dumbbells. He even picked up a 10-pound dumbbell with one hand and he noticed how heavy it felt in his hand. If only he was stronger, he would be able to lift a lot more than just 10 pounds. <br />
<br />
Clark had worn the jacket for over six hours that day, until the family finally got home. When he finally removed the jacket, he began to feel tired. The family got together one more time to have a light dinner before everyone gathered on the couch in the living room to watch TV. It was during the entertaining TV show that Clark just dozed off while sitting on the couch. So, his mother woke him up and told him to go to bed. Clark got up and stumbled his way to his bedroom where he removed his shirt and crawled in bed. <br />
<br />
When Clark woke up the following morning, it was very late. It was past 11 o’clock on Monday morning, which was very late for him. He never got up so late. He felt awake, alive, and filled with energy after that long nap. Not only that, but he also felt bigger, heavier, and much stronger than he ever felt before. Once he got up, he slowly stumbled into the bathroom where he gasped when he saw his reflection in the full-body mirror for the first time. <br />
<br />
Staring back at him was a teenage boy with very broad shoulders, thick delts and traps, thick arms filled with big, bulging biceps and triceps, along with large, solid pectorals. Finally, his lower torso was supported by an impressive layer of abdominal muscles which adorned his torso like a brick wall. His waist was small and narrow while his shoulders were wide and bulging with power. Mighty lats supported the lower side of his arms, where an impressive V-taper showed the big difference in width since his shoulders were twice as wide as his waist. <br />
<br />
Large, round, solid orbs of muscle jutted out from his frame as big pectorals stuck out from his chest. He could feel the weight from all that muscle between his shoulders, making him even feel a bit top-heavy. When he raised up his right arm, a large ball of muscle would swell up between his shoulder and his elbow. This was no bicep, it was a rock, a boulder, a bowling ball. An enormous 19-inch mound of solid bicep flexed on both arms, which made him feel truly empowered. He felt STRONG!<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” he could only whisper as he ran his hand over his super-defined abdominal muscles. He didn’t have a six-pack or an eight-pack. No, he had a twelve-pack of wide bricks which stuck out from his stomach, divided by deep grooves and valleys. It almost felt like a washboard in the kitchen sink. His abs felt like a concrete wall. They were hard, strong, thick, deep and solid. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! I’m strong! Like, really strong!” Clark could only smile as he looked down. His quads seemed even BIGGER than they were previously, for it seemed like they had widened by another two inches for sure. His legs almost looked like they were too thick, too big and too wide. Thick long veins ran across his big quads on both legs, and a hard glance in the mirror revealed that his calves had also grown a bit. He had morphed into a teen bodybuilder overnight!<br />
<br />
“Man… I wanna lift some weights so bad!” he sighed. He got dressed quickly and went to the small gym down the street. There, he found that he was easily able to lift more than 10 pounds. He picked up and curled the 25-pound dumbbells easily, on the first try. It felt amazing. <br />
<br />
“Clark! What are you doing here?” <br />
<br />
He turned around and spotted Jax, who happened to be in the gym that day. <br />
<br />
“Umm… Nothing… I’m just hanging out…” Clark replied shyly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shut up! You look kinda beefy! Have you been lifting weights?” Jax asked him.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… No, not really, I…” <br />
<br />
“Dude! You’re lying! Take off the jacket, man! Let me see your guns! You look a lot bigger than you were a few days ago!” Jax shouted. “Show me your muscle!”<br />
<br />
“Ohhh, alright…” Clark sighed as he slowly removed the jacket, revealing his muscular body underneath since he was only wearing a tank top. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Jax gasped. “Did the jacket do that to you? I mean… You’re jacked! You’re a beast!” <br />
<br />
“I… Uhh… I guess… I wore it all day yesterday and I was all big and buff when I woke up this morning!” Clark shrugged as he put the jacket back on.<br />
<br />
“So, what are you gonna do now?” Jax asked him curiously.<br />
<br />
“I wanna wear it for a few more days, then you can have it, okay?” Clark suggested. <br />
<br />
“That’s a deal. Thanks dude!” Jax smiled, as he walked away. <br />
<br />
Clark walked around before he did a few more exercises. Going to the gym was easy now. He was able to lift the heaviest weights on all the machines, so he felt great. <br />
<br />
That night he went home and removed the jacket before he went back to bed. </p>

Would the jacket change him again? How would it change Clark this time?</h3>
