<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dinner finished quite well with Nate and Alex heading upstairs to retrieve Alex&#39;s things before Nate actually walked Nate home. In some way it was something that had come to be expected with regard to the romantic interests in the Anderson home between the two werewolves. They would work on homework together, sometimes with Ben present as well, and depending on where Nate and Alex did their homework, one would then walk the other home. That was something that did come off as rather &quot;normal&quot; for the family and wasn&#39;t one of the things that William and Martha had had worries over of late. That had related more to Eric, which on the surface seemed to be doing better this afternoon. So as William began to clear the table and clean up after dinner, Martha quietly approached him, hoping not to alert Nate or Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to go update Frances on things,&quot; Martha said softly to her husband, with her thoughts still a bit worried over things with Eric, &quot;He is doing better... or at least he seemed so this afternoon, but I think Frances should know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; William nodded, &quot;and try not to worry too much. Whatever may be the issue... I&#39;m sure Frances will be of help... given what you&#39;ve said on how she and Samantha helped you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With my being bisexual, yes,&quot; Martha finished for him with a nod, remembering how she&#39;d repressed that for so long and how that contributed to some of the things that had given the Anderson family trouble in the past. The fact that the Twists did help her with that warmed her heart and gave her some confidence that Frances could help Eric if there truly was something wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you later,&quot; William said to her and gave her a small kiss on cheek, &quot;and be happy. Things will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded at the encouragement and then made her way out. The night air was relatively cool, and likely did signal the coming of winter, which raised some curiosity in the back of Martha&#39;s mind. Minnesota&#39;s winters could be quite frigid with the potential for plenty of &quot;snow days&quot; during the school year. Washington State, however, while it got more precipitation and could get snow, was known for being as cold. It made her wonder what winter would be like in Moon Lake. That, however, remained in the back of her mind as she reached forward and then knocked on the Twist&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
A few moments later the door opened to reveal Samantha Twist who managed a small smile as the door opened. Martha wasn&#39;t totally surprised by this, though she wasn&#39;t expecting to run in with Samantha at the moment, as it was Frances she&#39;d come to see. Though, she also figured it might be a good idea to tell Samantha about things for the moment, as if there would be something that Eric would need help with, her neighbors would be needed to help Eric if there were ever circumstances that the Anderson family couldn&#39;t help their youngest. These thoughts raced through Martha&#39;s mind rather quickly while waiting for Samantha to actually speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Martha... is something wrong?&quot; Samantha asked calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is &quot;wrong&quot; at the moment... though there is something I&#39;d like to update Frances on,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;Is she home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we just finished dinner a little while ago and Ben has gone to finish up his homework,&quot; Samantha answered and stepped back from the door, granting Martha access, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha detected a bit of puzzlement in Samantha&#39;s voice and guessed that Frances hadn&#39;t told her wife about Martha&#39;s visit to Frances&#39; clinic earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it, dear?&quot; came Frances&#39;s voice from the kitchen with her voice sounding a bit loud as she was talking over running water in the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Martha,&quot; Samantha answered back, &quot;She said she has something she needs to update you on something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha then quietly looked back to the Anderson family&#39;s matriarch. Her brown eyes seemed to be darting back and forth as though she were drifting between the doorway to the kitchen/dining room and Samantha. It struck Samantha that Martha was a bit worried about something, which was in and of itself a bit worrying for her. She and Frances had both genuinely liked Martha and in some way figured out that Martha was bisexual and had been seriously repressing it, which was the inspiration for their desire to befriend Martha when the Andersons first moved to Moon Lake. This would in turn lead to some antagonism with William Anderson over his actions after Yvette Smith first clawed him and his transformation was incomplete, and the remarks that related to the stresses that had been in the Anderson marriage that had been the cause of the family&#39;s move to Moon Lake. Things had ultimately smoothed out, for as William&#39;s transformation was completed, a werefox&#39;s bond formed to Martha and that obvious tension seemed to ease. Though, the fact that Martha seemed to be worrying about something was enough to raise some concerns on Samantha&#39;s part as she escorted Martha down the hallway and toward the living room.<br />
<br />
Samantha got Martha to the couch just as Frances made it into the doorway to the living room. Frances found her wife calmly patting the back of Martha&#39;s hand for a moment, though as Frances entered the room, Samantha moved to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you a moment of privacy,&quot; Samantha spoke, guessing that this had to be something that related some element of therapeutic needs, which Frances really couldn&#39;t share with anyone but her clients.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay...&quot; Martha reached out and caught Samantha&#39;s hand before Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor could pull away, &quot;In fact... I&#39;d think it&#39;d be a good idea to include you in this too... especially if something ever comes up and William and I can&#39;t be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Samantha blink in a rather puzzled manner. It confirmed her suspicion that Martha was worried about something, and the &quot;if William and I can&#39;t be there&quot; made it sound potentially serious. However, at the moment there didn&#39;t seem to be any major issue directly in Moon Lake that was a major threat. Yvette Smith had been caught, tried, and was presently serving her term for clawing William Anderson and then Jennifer Harper-Jenkins. Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agents were either dead or in jail having agreed to plead guilty on the charges against them as part of a plea deal to testify against Dieter Wilhelm, who was in Federal custody, though his trial might not be for awhile yet... depending on how quick the FBI and the Federal Court system wanted to act. Alice Decrux was dead after driving too fast on a mountain road and going over a cliff and Dymixious Drake was dead thanks to his fighting with the Moon Lake PD. In this, Samantha couldn&#39;t think of any real threat that would be coming into Moon Lake and posing a threat to anyone at the moment. Samantha&#39;s puzzlement didn&#39;t ease when Frances blinked and then inquired to Martha as she sat down next to the brown haired woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Has something happened with Eric since we talked at lunch?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing bad... in fact he seemed to be much better when he came home from school,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and even said that some of his worries were based off of a misunderstanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that IS good news,&quot; Frances gave a small smile, &quot;I trust there was no manic behavior on Eric&#39;s part?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... he was with Julie and as happy as he could be,&quot; Martha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on with Eric?!&quot; Samantha asked, still puzzled as to all of this and wondering what had brought Martha in with this. After all it seemed as though Martha had come to tell Frances that Eric was doing fine. In a sense, she was missing something.<br />
<br />
Frances glanced over to Martha, who nodded, and then returned her gaze to her wife, &quot;Apparently, Julie had a homework project that required her to be working with another weremer on that project. Eric noticed, and since neither he nor Julie have classes together nor are their study hall periods linked with each other there was a very limited amount of time they could interact, and the homework project that Julie had seemed to cut in with what time Eric did have to interact with Julie...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it he got a bit jealous?&quot; Samantha wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just jealous but that he started regressing into the more withdrawn and quiet behaviors he had in Minnesota,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;It worried William and I... as meeting Julie made him so happy and so open. We&#39;ve loved seeing him happy and open and we don&#39;t know what to do. We&#39;ve tried talking to him... and I think all we did was make things worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she came to me around lunch time to ask about possible solutions to try,&quot; Frances picked up the explanation and keeping her voice low enough that Ben wouldn&#39;t overhear anything, &quot;and I have agreed to help, though that will require some formal sessions with Eric to gain more information before I can do or say anything formally...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha gave a nervous frown of her own, &quot;but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given what Martha has described, it could be possible that Eric is suffering from some form of depression or bipolar disorder,&quot; Frances finished, &quot;now... it&#39;ll be circumstantial if that is the case, which means that Eric would only need some therapy to get many of the things he&#39;s carried within him out, which in a sense means he shouldn&#39;t require medication to treat it... but again, I can&#39;t make a formal diagnosis until I&#39;ve talked with Eric.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can help him, right?&quot; Samantha asked, sounding a bit nervous herself. Weres were astonishingly tough creatures in that many things that would be serious or fatal to normal humans weren&#39;t anywhere near as dangerous to weres, but issues of mental stress seemed to be one of those things that being a were wouldn&#39;t be an automatic cure. She remembered a story that a were who&#39;d been sent to Vietnam in the 60s, survived the fighting and returned to Moon Lake, only to commit suicide a few years later under conditions that sounded a lot like PTSD.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Frances smiled confidently and nodded to her wife while putting an arm around Martha for the moment, &quot;I can. Now... the fact that Eric was doing better this afternoon is a good thing. But, the issue may go deeper than just whatever this misunderstanding with Julie was. It could be in relation to the kids that bullied him in Minnesota. It could be in relation noticing the stresses at home... It could have even been something else that he hasn&#39;t told anyone. That can&#39;t be determined until I&#39;ve had a session with him... BUT, I can say that I can help him. I think it&#39;s likely circumstantial... brought on by stress, which means therapy is the best treatment and that I can help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha smiled at that. She felt a bit comforted by having Frances&#39;s arm around her and seeing Samantha soon return Frances&#39;s confident smile. It gave her a greater sense of confidence that things WOULD be fine, particularly after Eric had come home from school in a much better mood than he&#39;d been in when he&#39;d left for school that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Martha leaned over to hug Frances, with a great deal of gratitude in her heart for her fellow werecat, &quot;This whole thing has had me so worried... William&#39;s tried to help... but he&#39;s worried too and neither of us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just busy being concerned parents,&quot; Frances assured Martha, nuzzling her head to Martha&#39;s and purring, even while in her human form to give Martha some comfort, &quot;Perfectly normal... Though... it&#39;ll be best to put those worries to bed. Everything will be fine. And the more you project that you&#39;re nervous... the more Eric may become nervous for you. You want to be calm and confident that everything will be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and nuzzled Frances back, finding herself purring as well, even while in human form. Getting the added assurance from Frances did help, and even Samantha&#39;s quiet confidence in Frances seemed to set Martha at ease. She soon felt the couch cushions sink a little bit as Samantha sat down on her other side, and soon felt  strong fingers giving her a gentle back rub. It felt nice and knowing that it was with her pride gave Martha an added feel of contentment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be fine,&quot; Samantha said to Martha, &quot;You can be assured of that. We&#39;ll do what we can... and Frances will do a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Martha felt herself purr in contentment and growing confidence with the reassurance that Frances could help Eric and that her pride would be there for her on the issue. It made her feel better, which she liked, and the closeness between the three of them soon began to draw other feelings. She could feel one of Frances&#39; breasts press into her own bosom while Samantha&#39;s pressed into her from the other side, and even within the confines of her shirt and bra, it was generating a response that all three werecats could soon detect.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think Frances and I can help you with some of your stress in a way that you&#39;ll like,&quot; Samantha purred, catching a growing scent of arousal coming from Martha as the three of them sat together on the couch. She could also catch some scent of arousal from Frances and could feel herself beginning to grow wet as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Martha managed to purr back and letting herself pull Samantha and Frances tighter to her and feeling her nipples grow erect and pushing into the cups of her bra as she caught the scent of Samantha and Frances&#39;s growing arousal and feeling that then drive her forward, &quot;I do have a lot of stress to work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s go to bed and get started,&quot; Frances whispered into Martha&#39;s ear with a  certain tone that Martha nodded to.<br />
<br />
The three then stood up, and after turning out the lights in the kitchen and elsewhere in the home made their way toward the master bedroom. Martha did remember it, as it was where she joined were society and where Frances and Samantha had given her the final gift that helped her get over repressing her bi side for so long. And for that reason, while a part of her was very eager enjoy all sides of her sexuality, especially with those that returned an interest in her, Samantha and Frances would always have a special place in her heart. And because of that, she couldn&#39;t contain her inner werecat anymore...<br />
<br />
Even as Martha began to remove her shirt, she felt a familiar and happy warmth engulf her as she began to transform into her fursona, based on the Havana Brown breed of house cat. Brown fur began to grow out of her skin and rapidly became a very full and warm pelt, even if the length of the fur was rather short. She slipped out of her shoes as she heard the door click behind them and looked back to see Samantha and Frances closing the door behind them. Samantha&#39;s ears were already triangular points rising up onto the top of her head while France&#39;s eyes turned green and with her pupils stretched vertically until they became very feline slits.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been far too long,&quot; Martha said slowly as she raised up her feet to allow her now clawed fingers to pull down her socks. The cotton material tickled the pads underneath her fingertips a little, but she&#39;d also found that the pads on her hands and feet in her were form could be incredibly tough. Walking barefoot in the woods on them didn&#39;t bother her in the slightest. She inwardly marveled at how her foot soon began to lengthen after her sock was removed. And as she looked to Samantha and Frances, she could see their feet beginning to stretch longer to. It gave all three of them the sense of rising into the air as their feet lengthened and they took on a digitigrade stance. They weren&#39;t as tall as Ben, Nate, or Alex in their fursonas, but then werewolves were bigger than werecats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it has,&quot; Samantha agreed, running a tongue over her changing teeth, her canines lengthening to form the sharp needle like teeth house cats used to kill prey, and she could softly hear Frances&#39; facial bones begin to crack and snap a little as it pushed forward into a rounded feline muzzle. She knew that Martha would probably spend most of her time with William, the fact that his behavior improved after his transformation was completed gave Samantha enough recognition on that, but that didn&#39;t change that both she and Frances had had some base attraction with Martha, and particularly with Martha&#39;s voice, and that as members of the same pride, there was always the potential room for there being some action between the three of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... it looks like you&#39;re a bit contained,&quot; Frances commented as she slid out of her panties and watched as Martha&#39;s brown furred breasts swelled inside a bra that looked a bit small on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha nodded, as her own face pushed forward into a brown furred muzzle and having to pause for a moment as her head assumed its full feline form. The scent of arousal was now very high as Martha could easily smell it on all three of them and she knew that even if she hadn&#39;t been willing for this as some form of stress relief, her own raised libido as a werecat would probably drive her onward, and to a certain extent... she didn&#39;t care. Transforming felt good... wonderful... in a way... it made her feel whole. Like the werecat she was turning into was the real her while the human form was just something she hid behind, and it meant that whenever Martha transformed... and especially when there was the prospect of some &quot;fun,&quot; that transforming was borderline orgasmic for her. &quot;This is one of my old bras... it&#39;s... a bit... small on the new me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances both approached with playful smiles as a long black and brown tail grew out behind Samantha while and auburn/red orange tail grew out behind Frances. They were already nude, and by the erect nipples poking through their fur, Martha got some sense of what was coming and went along with it. Martha let her hands slip down to her own panties and pulled them down as her own brown tail grew out behind her. Her pride mates approached her with Frances nuzzling and licking at the whiskers on right side of Martha&#39;s feline muzzle while Samantha did the same on the left. Their hands reached around and were soon at work with the clasps on her bra. As they came unhooked, her generous E cup bosom bounced for a moment before standing out proudly in front of her with her own nipples clearly erect through her brown fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better?&quot; Samantha asked as she watched Martha smile happily while caressing Martha&#39;s left breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much,&quot; Martha purred as Frances cupped her right breast and nuzzled both Samantha and Frances back, while reaching down with her own paw-like hands to gently rub the outside of their wet vaginas, drawing purring moan from both of them &quot;Thank you... for everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three slowly climbed into the bed, being careful as Martha was going backwards, but they made it easily. The started with Frances and Samantha seated to that they would be able to grind their vaginas against Martha&#39;s thighs and while she could grind hers against their thighs together or in alternation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything to help a member of our pride,&quot; Samantha answered bent down to lick and nibble at Martha&#39;s left breast and nipple, and moaning as she felt Martha&#39;s paws softly massage her own breasts.<br />
<br />
And the three would soon continue on from there for the evening...</p>
