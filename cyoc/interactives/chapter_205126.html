<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You see an expertly drawn succubus in the notebook. Honestly, you&#39;ve seen some people with much less artistic skills sell their art for a lot of money. <br />
&quot;You drew this?&quot; you say amazed, &quot;This is the best piece of art I&#39;ve seen in ages!&quot;<br />
&quot;Re-Really?&quot; She says, &quot;You&#39;re not...&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no, I can work with this!&quot; you say, &quot;Now, you want me to transform you into this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she says, &quot;Is there an issue?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll assume that this is supposed to be a succubus,&quot; you say, &quot;And that that bulge isn&#39;t just her underwear bunching up?&quot;<br />
&quot;If-if you check the next pages, I-I&#39;ve done some measurements...&quot; she stutters, her face turning an adorable shade of crimson.<br />
You turn the page over, seeing a bunch of reference angles, and measurements. &quot;Ah, ok,&quot; you say, &quot;I see. Now, there are some... problems with this. First off, you have to understand that becoming something is a completely different thing from just looking like it. I sure could transform you into a futanari succubus, However, that wouldn&#39;t really end well. Simply becoming either of the two would cause you to become ridiculously horny; both would end badly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah... Ok.&quot; Ellen says defeated, &quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;However,&quot; you say, closing the book, &quot;There&#39;s that difference I was talking about. It&#39;d be a terrible idea to turn you into a succubus. It&#39;d be much easier to just turn you into a succubus look-alike. There&#39;d be no change that you&#39;d notice. And you&#39;ll be able to eat food, instead of having to drink semen. That&#39;s a big plus.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, look-alike. So long as I look like that. I&#39;d be so happy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mhm, now, second thing. Mental and reality. I could make it so that you&#39;re not you anymore, do the same thing I did to the boys, or just add skills, and I could make you not remember not being a Pseudo Succubus, or I could make no-one remember you as a Pseudo Succubus.&quot;<br />
&quot;Um... What?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let me rephrase: On a scale of &#39;Completely different person&#39; to &#39;you but with more skills&#39;, how heavily do you want the succubus&#39; personality to override yours? And on a scale of &#39;Even you don&#39;t remember your old self&#39; to &#39;No one knows your new self&#39;, how much do you want people to be aware?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, I still want to be myself, and... how would the second one work?&quot;<br />
&quot;You know how no one freaked out at the prick&#39;s transformations? Almost like it had never happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kinda like that. I could make it so specific people realize you&#39;ve changed. So, say you had a best friend who was into this stuff? I could make it so they know, but for example, your parents? They&#39;d see nothing wrong with their daughter being a succubus. Hell, I could make it so that only people have eaten dog biscuits after being dared to by their crush realize that you&#39;re not supposed to be naked. We can figure this out later though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Could my parents still recognize me, even though I look completely different than they remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess? I don&#39;t quite get what you mean. Anyways, take off your clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry!?!&quot; Ellen says. To be fair, you did just ask her to strip.<br />
&quot;Clothes could interfere with the magic.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, ok. Turn around?&quot; You do so and turn back when she&#39;s done. You quickly turn her into her drawing but delay it a bit. <br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;m done,&quot; you say, &quot;It&#39;ll be a couple minutes, because I wanted to do it properly.&quot;<br />
You sit down next to her, and you two talk about some things. You watch, as her skin turns a deep red, starting at her stomach, before spreading to the rest of her. Her hair changes first, softening then lengthening. Her face shifts, her chin narrowing, her cheekbones rising. From her temples, two horns emerge forwards, before curving up and back, stopping just past the back of her skull. Her lips puff up, her opened mouth turning into a rounded &#39;O&#39;. Her muffin top shrinks, as her waist caves in on itself. Muscles sprout under her flawless, silky skin, bumbs breaking up her otherwise soft appearance. Then comes the arousal. Her now amber, pupilless eyes with void black sclera half open, and her snake like tongue sticks out a foot or so. A deep, sensual moan escapes her lips, as her breasts expand. While already impressive, her bust grows by at least 6 inches or so. You&#39;d estimate the perky globes to stick out a full foot from her curvy frame. She mindlessly grabs at you, shoving your face in her neck. While she does this, you realize she&#39;s already finished growing to her final 6&#39;8&#39;&#39;. You manage to manuver your way onto her shoulder, just in time to witness her compact tush and slim hips nearly explode. Her boney derriere blossoms into more than a handful, the bubble-like globes would engulf your hand, were you to try. Her hips widen, snapping her distressed panties. As her thighs thicken, you use your ring to change her wardrobe to fit her new body. A few more uses, and her ears start growing, all of the flesh in her lobes rising, like something had pinched and pulled her ears. Her now footlong ears shift around with her emotions. An odd noise emerges from her tailbone, and a tail follows soon after. 5 feet later, her tail waves around, the soft, bristly hair making a nice brushing noise. Her moans shift, her voice deepening. Her Mezzo Soprano lowers into a contralto, which then rises in volume. You feel something poking your leg, before eventually shifting it aside, as it keeps growing, and growing, and growing. <br />
Her transformation over, you pause time and examine her, before doing some changes to her drawing, and to her. For one, you make her super low maintenance, yet still accept a high level of Maintenace, like yourself. You turn the tips of her hair a bright yellow, along with those on the tip of her tail. You give her an infernal accent, which you guess is an eastern bloc accent, with some European influences. You unpause time and tap her on the shoulder. &quot;Ellen?&quot; You climb on to the bed and try again. &quot;Ellen?&quot; Between blinks, she&#39;s on top of you, her pupilless eyes staring into yours. <br />
&quot;Cerise,&quot; She says, pronouncing it like &#39;Sa-rr-ese&#39;, &quot;How... How old are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;21,&quot; you say, and then make true a moment later. Before you can ask why, her tongue is in your mouth, and you two start kissing. A few minutes later, she pulls up, keeping a hand on your sternum. <br />
&quot;I... I need to fuck you,&quot; She breathes, and takes her hand off your sternum, &quot;You, you should go, before I... Before I lose control of my senses,&quot; she growls.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m down,&quot; you say, taking off your clothes, &quot;And don&#39;t worry,&quot; You kiss her nose, &quot;I can take it~&quot;<br />
Wordlessly, you drop down to her footlong dick, and a few wishes under your breath later, you grab it. After a few quick strokes, you get going, putting your lips around the head of her massive cock. You lick around her head, before you feel her grab your temples. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; she says. You nod, and she continues. &quot;I gave you an out, though. Now, you follow me.&quot; Shoving your head all the way down, she uses your mouth as a toy, pulling you up and down repeatedly. When you feel she is about to cum, you rise, and then, a sweet, sticky concoction fires into your mouth. You have to swallow a couple times, but eventually, the firehose lesens, and you show the white bounty in your mouth, before swallowing. If anything, that makes Ellen harder, but you grab her hand and head to her room. You lean down, presenting your tight pussy to the world. Before long, two warm hands grab your hips, and shove a long, deep rod into your tight hole. You moan, bucking your hips back, instinctively trying to swallow her cock in your soft, wet insides. With a grunt, Ellen thrusts into you, making your mind explode in pleasure. A few heavenly thrusts later, she grabs your hips and flips you around. Bending down, she shoves her pendulous breasts into your face, and in your lust addled haze, you turn her nipples into tentacles. Once they emerge from her bosom, they make their way into your mouth. You cum. Ellen hasn&#39;t been pleased yet though, picking you up and fucking you into the wall. <br />
Then onto your couch<br />
Then your counter-top<br />
Then she lays on your bed, thrusting her hips strongly enough that you bounce back up. Your hungry pussy feels hollow for just a split second, but that just makes the bliss that comes from the next penetration all the stronger. <br />
Sometime later, Ellen has you in a vague approximation of a breeding press, though you&#39;ve long stopped noticing, your entire frame of mind filled with nothing but &#39;cock fill breed cock cum tits&#39; over and over again. Ellen has used her tentacle nipples to tie you to her, bouncing in sync with each other. <br />
She cums.<br />
Your prior experience of pleasure is but a mere spark compared to the inferno of pure bliss that fills your head. The last thing you see is Ellen dropping you on your bed, her dick shrinking now that her lust has been tamed.</p>
