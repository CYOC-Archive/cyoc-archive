<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unaware of the dueling Chronivacs, Jeff went to edit his father&#39;s profile minimally.  His current libido was set to medium, which explained some of their interactions the previous night.  Still, Jeff had no fear of his father as he tweaked the setting from &#39;medium&#39; to &#39;high&#39;, avoiding &#39;very high&#39; and &#39;extreme&#39; settings.  Hitting save, he smirked as he moved to his own settings and considered his options.<br />
<br />
Just to be careful, Jeff changed the Jane profile to have stronger willpower.  Hitting save, the machine seemed to lag for just a tenth of a second... almost imperceptible to Jeff, but just barely so.  It hadn&#39;t done that before, and he noticed, but he didn&#39;t have any context to understand it meant anything.<br />
<br />
It did, though.  It meant the Chronivac was waiting on other changes to be valid and non-conflicting before it went ahead an executed on the new alterations Jeff was making.  There was no problem with having a higher willpower, though, and Mikes changes to the local Jane template went on through with Jeff non-the-wiser.<br />
<br />
Smirking, thinking his plan was in motion, Jeff departed his own room while still looking completely like his mother, unaware that anything was further amiss than it already was.  His bisexual nature imbued by his father&#39;s saving into the Jane settings was unaware to him.  But as he began to make the two of them some breakfast in the kitchen, he found cooking no issue.  No burning the eggs or bacon.  No mistakes at all... and he thought nothing of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a little surprise for you,&quot; came Mike&#39;s voice as Jeff was leaning over the table and setting some orange juice to go with their meal.  Moving up behind him, Jeff smirked, thinking the teasing was about to begin... but as his father&#39;s length, semi-hard shaft pressed into his legs from behind, the young teen considered perhaps he had made a mistake.<br />
<br />
Without looking, he knew that his father&#39;s cock was bigger than any he&#39;d ever seen.  It was flared around it&#39;s end, flat and blunt, and it swung lightly between his thick, womanly thighs.  Jeff tensed slightly as he realized his father was all monstrous.  He towered over his son from behind, thinking he was his wife... and huffed air out his big equine nostrils as he leaned over those slender shoulders before him.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s big meaty hands had tannish colored thick nails circling the ends of his wide digits.  White fur covered over those fingers and his hands, with longer white hair falling away from their sides in a narrow line all the way back to his elbow.  As Jeff realized his father must be a Clydesdale, the game became too real.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you prefer speedier horses, but we can try those later,&quot; Mike chuckled from within his barreled chest at the back of Jeff&#39;s head.  Those hands along his sides inched around his waist and touched his lower belly right above his pussy, underneath the robe.  His mother&#39;s body was sensitive, but even more so in that area.  His father&#39;s big beefy hands used his index finger and thumb to slowly rub around his son&#39;s newest nipples there, somewhere between human nubs and a mare&#39;s teats.<br />
<br />
Jeff gasped, looking down as that space above and to the side of his mostly hairless slit grew out into hazelnut-brown fur in the color of his mother&#39;s hair.  His father was all teasing now, but had his &#39;wife&#39; at a disadvantage.  Would Jeff become a horse, or had his father compromised his amazonian fetish with his wife&#39;s equine petplay?  Yes, that seemed more likely... maybe he could do this after all.  His will was strong.<br />
<br />
Weight of both muscle and fat plumped up Jeff&#39;s ass as his father whispered sweet nothings in his ears.  The boy who was a mature woman grew taller and more muscled as his father leaned into him and hugged him close.  The man was restrained, but soon enough Jeff&#39;s robe was being lifted by his father&#39;s horse-sized monster dick until it pushed up against the boy&#39;s newly plump and wet marehood.<br />
<br />
With some reservation towards his situation, Jeff&#39;s bands brushed over his soft mounds of breastflesh at his crotch and brushed over his father&#39;s hands to feel the thick walls of his new lips and the human-thumb-sized nub of a clit.  He gasped again, and as his new equine snout pushed out into white fur and blunt teeth, Jeff realized he&#39;d have to say something if he wanted this to stop.<br />
<br />
But a part of him found this easier.  Whenever Mike&#39;s voice went quite for a moment as those strong hands explored Jeff&#39;s new firm abs and DD breasts with their thick hazelnut-colored fur and flesh and areolas that were easily as wide as his mom&#39;s formerly small human hands, Jeff realized he could see himself trying this as a horse-woman with a horse-man... but each time Mike spoke again, that illusion was gone.<br />
<br />
As Jeff&#39;s transformation ended, he stood almost seven foot tall with his father easily an inch or two beyond that mark.  He hands were now like his, and he reached back to touch his new darker, straight-furred tail.  When his dad touched his wrist and guided him to his hard length, Jeff realized his wider-stance now stood over his father&#39;s shaft.  WIth the boy&#39;s other hand, he reached forward and touched just the end of his father&#39;s blunt end.<br />
<br />
Briefly, the boy marveled in it&#39;s size and girth.  As his father shifted at his &#39;wife&#39;s touch, Jeff leaned in and planted that kiss against his dad&#39;s thick lips that he&#39;d given thought to the night before.  To Jeff, this wasn&#39;t his father in that moment.  He might recoil, but not now.  For now, he wondered about the glob at the end of his suitor&#39;s shaft, only to realize shortly that it was a slowly expanding amount of dripping, thick pre-cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure Jeff won&#39;t be home anytime soon?&quot;  Mike asked who he thought was his wife.  In that moment, Jeff&#39;s body stiffened.  This was the moment of truth.  He had the chance to stop this, else his father was going to fuck him... and, unless he pulled out, making even breed him.  Jeff shivered at that thought, the sickness he knew he should feel alleviated somewhat by the re-saving of Jane&#39;s profile over him.  Neither of them were related now, let alone human... what was incest of all that was left o know it was in their heads?<br />
<br />
Well, no... not their heads, just Jeff&#39;s.  Jeff would know, but it would be a dirty little secret, maybe.  Right?  When the week was up and he shifted back to himself, he&#39;d never have to tell anyone if maybe his dad was the first best sex he&#39;d ever had...</p>
