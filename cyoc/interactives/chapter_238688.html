<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To the new John, everything felt disorienting and strange. One moment, he had been standing naked at the front of the class with Murray and Gavin, with Mr. Scaftie placing a headband on him, and the next, he found himself curled up in a giant Mr. Scaftie’s arms. As his senses sharpened, he realized he was no longer in his familiar teenage body but instead in the form of a newborn. It was as though time had warped, leaving him feeling trapped in a version of reality he didn&#39;t fully understand.<br />
<br />
Investigating himself, he was indeed in the infant version of himself, but with some subtle differences. It lacked the small, personal markers he’d grown up with—no constellation of freckles on his shoulders, no mole on the side of his neck. Those tiny imperfections molded by the random quirks of a lifetime rather than preordained by DNA. Additionally, his foreskin was intact. His original body had been circumcised as a baby, but this one was untouched. Nor did he have the plump, oversized testicles caused by the pill he took two years ago. Though he suspected this was not his way out of being property of Genodyne Innovations, given now his entire body was manufactured by their tech.<br />
<br />
Mr. Scaftie, his voice calm and clinical, addressed the class. &quot;Normally, at this stage, the umbilical cord would be cut, and the process would be complete. However, since we need Johnathan to return to his original age and full physical capabilities, we&#39;ll have to continue the incubation a while longer.&quot; <br />
“Wait, what does that mean?” Johnathan asked in confusion, his infant voice undermining him a little.<br />
“Don’t worry Johnathan, you will be out of Murray’s womb in roughly four weeks. That will be long enough for your body to catch up to your original age.” The teacher assured him as he brought baby John back over to Murray’s spread legs.<br />
Both boys shouted objections as Mr Scaftie started placing John’s head back into Murray’s vagina. His little baby arms desperately tried to push against the lips of his classmate’s pussy to delay the inevitable. He was unsuccessful as his whole body slipped up and into the womb. Murray yelped as the feeling of being extremely full returned and watched with despair as his belly expanded once again to accommodate the newborn. His pussy stretched wide as if he was giving birth in reverse.<br />
<br />
From inside Murray&#39;s womb, Johnathan’s perspective was disorienting. A dim, reddish glow filtered through the stretched, semi-translucent skin walls, casting everything in a warm, crimson hue. The rhythmic pulse of Murray’s heartbeat was ever-present, a steady thrum that seemed to reverberate through the confined space. Shadows danced faintly, the result of movements and light from outside the womb shifting and bending as it passed through layers of skin and tissue.<br />
<br />
The teacher assured the class, and Johnathan in particular, that he would not fall behind in his studies during this unusual stage of his development. With a small but fully functional waterproof tablet sealed in a specialized case, he would have access to the school’s Wi-Fi and all the necessary resources for completing his assignments. The divine, similar size to most IPads was then slipped up in through Murray’s pussy also. The bloated teen yelped again as his insides had to adjust to the foreign object sliding though his uterus.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an unconventional setup,&quot; the teacher explained, &quot;but it ensures that Johnathan remains an active participant in his education, even during this... transformative experience. With the tablet’s touch screen and camera, John could interact with teachers and you all remotely.&quot;<br />
<br />
After another 30 mins of drawing diagrams and note taking the class was over. Murray took a deep breath and pushed himself up from the chair with some effort, his now heavily pregnant form making every movement feel deliberate and weighted. His belly was stretched impossibly taut, its size dominating his frame and shifting slightly with each step as Johnathan resettled inside. He grabbed his backpack and to his mounting embarrassment, beads of milk began to form at his exposed nipples, dripping in thin streams that left glistening trails down his chest and stomach. He instinctively pressed an arm across his chest, but it only caused the milk to flow faster, soaking his skin and drawing even more attention.<br />
<br />
With the help of his friend Samuel, Murray’s steps were slow but steady as he made his way out the door, his cheeks flushed from both the effort and the awkward stares. Outside, a few students passing in the hallway paused, their expressions bouncing between curiosity and amusement at the sight of his engorged form and the milk dripping onto the floor with every step. <br />
<br />
Sighing as he waddled through the bustling school corridors, Murray glanced down at his heavily swollen belly, which shifted slightly with every step as Johnathan adjusted inside. &quot;Alright, John, quit squirming. You&#39;re not making this any easier for me.&quot;<br />
From deep within, John&#39;s muffled voice came through, tinged with irritation. &quot;Not making this easier for you? Try being stuck in here for four weeks! It’s like living in a sauna, and I barely have room to stretch! But I guess I didn’t die, so… that’s something.&quot;<br />
Gavin, walking alongside Murray, rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. &quot;Uh… yeah, about that, man. Hate to break it to you, but… you—well, the original you—totally did die. Swallowed by my cock and, uh, melted into cum. You’re basically a clone with the original Johnathan’s memories.&quot;<br />
There was a beat of silence before John’s voice erupted in a muffled shout. &quot;WHAT?! Are you kidding me? I thought I was just unconscious!&quot;<br />
Murray paused mid-step as the weight of the revelation seemed to hang in the air. Inside, there was a long, tense pause before John muttered, &quot;Fuuuuucccck. That’s some heavy existentialism shit that is going to keep me up all night.&quot;<br />
Murray rolled his eyes, continuing his slow march toward the cafeteria. &quot;Yeah, well, I’m gonna be kept up by a classmate squishing my insides all night, so I guess we’ll be in the same boat.&quot;<br />
Samuel smirked as he fell into step with them, clearly enjoying the fact that he will never have to go through any of this. &quot;Yeah, Johnathan. Look on the bright side—you’re not really dead. You’re just, uh, a fresher version of yourself.&quot;<br />
Phil pointed at the white droplets forming on Murray’s nipples. &quot;And speaking of fresh, Murray’s got plenty of fresh milk for us whenever we’re thirsty.&quot;<br />
Murray shot him a glare, adjusting his backpack as another bead of milk rolled down from his left breast. &quot;That’s disgusting dude.”<br />
Well you are practically two leaky faucets at the moment. Come on, at least let us have a good squeeze. I never had a chance to touch a real boob&quot; The thought of doing so immediately gave Phil a boner, which everyone passing in the hallway could see. The rest of the group just laughed.</p>
