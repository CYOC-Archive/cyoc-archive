<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... I&#39;ve seen you mentioned on Animalia Ambassadoria,&quot; Scala said to the Macaroni Penguin Animalian that was there as part of the &quot;circus meeting&quot; and was actually fairly curious about the penguin Animalian. So far as Scala knew, any and all penguin Animalians were uplifted ones, but the fact that the one she was talking to still had her hair showed that she was a converted Human, &quot;but I think they only mentioned you as &quot;N. Brusmith.&quot; Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Partially because that&#39;s what I wanted to share,&quot; N. Brusmith answered, &quot;at the time... anyway. And that was mostly because of my first name... Nerthus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nerthus?&quot; Scala blinked at the name.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents were REALLY into mythology when I was born... and Germanic mythology in particular,&quot; Nerthus Brusmith answered, &quot;and whatever odd reason... they picked an odd name for a goddess from the Frisian Islands. It was odd and they&#39;d never let me change my name... and I had to promise that I wouldn&#39;t legally change it. So, I&#39;ve just abbreviated it to &quot;N.&quot; It&#39;s easier that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... from some islands... is that why you chose to be a penguin?&quot; Scala wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s more the fact that I&#39;ve liked penguins as a group of animals... always formally dressed,&quot; Nerthus Brusmith answered, &quot;and I choose the Macaroni Penguin because of its brow...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you used to live in a hole near here?&quot; Nerthus Brusmith asked to Judy after one painfully embarrassing explanation on why her parents named her after a goddess from the Frisian Islands in Germanic mythology.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I was uplifted, yes,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;after I was uplifted, I moved into the apartments built for Animalia... and quite pleased with the fact that Horizon offered me a chance to work with them here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you never thought about doing anything more... adventurous?&quot; Nerthus wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... while a fair number of Animalians have been quite willing to show all... not all of them being converted Humans... that sort of thing never struck me as interesting,&quot; Judy answered.<br />
<br />
Nerthus only shrugged. A part of her interest in conversion was in related to that She&#39;d always figured her libido was a bit higher than other girls when she&#39;d been growing up, but a lot of that was natural and she didn&#39;t change her mind on that after she&#39;d grown up and moved out. Some of those that had looked down on her for her choices in career often seemed to be prudes who probably didn&#39;t get any action, so they simply claimed they were more moral because they weren&#39;t getting any or weren&#39;t comfortable with regard to the adult version of &quot;show and tell.&quot; The Macaroni Penguin would give Animalia an additional penguin and Nerthus had always liked it, regardless of its oddities.<br />
<br />
They walked along until they came to one of the doors that lead into the transformation rooms. Judy had the case for the syringes in her lab coat and opened the door for Nerthus and letting the woman in. Nerthus looked around the room with some surprise to find some of the spartan nature of the room and that the most notable things were a mirror hanging on the wall and the bed that was along a wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm… I&#39;d said I was looking to be a Macaroni Penguin,&quot; Nerthus stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is what you will be,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;but Mari is the Macaroni Penguin from which we have the strain for that particular species for with the Animalia Virus. And as an uplifted penguin, she isn&#39;t exactly into girl on girl relationships.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... uh... how will you do this, then?&quot; Nerthus asked as she watched Judy shut the door. <br />
<br />
The rabbit Animalian soon placed a hand into the larger outer pocket on her lab coat. There seemed to be something in that pocket that pushed against the fabric was rectangular shaped. What Judy pulled out was a plastic case with a snap that was visible. Nerthus watched Judy operate the device and revealed two syringes encased in foam and with an alcohol swab in the box as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;The primary way that Horizon will carry out conversions is with injections, which can then let us administer the vaccine after the transformation,&quot; Judy spoke, &quot;issues where the beds here would be applicable would be if either two people are becoming Animalians of the same species or if a Human is marrying an Animalian and converting in order to meet Animalia&#39;s edicts regarding breeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about mixed species couples?&quot; Nerthus wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The edicts don&#39;t dictate on who one loves, in this a bull Animalian could love a mare Animalian, but any children would have to be adopted,&quot; Judy answered.<br />
<br />
Nerthus gave a bit of a shrug and let things go from there. Judy applied the swap to one arm and then administered the shots with the traditional &quot;welcome to Animalia&quot; that came with it. From there, Judy placed the safety caps on the syringes and put them back in the box before departing and leaving Nerthus alone. To some extent, she actually wished for an audience, but she really couldn&#39;t dwell on that that much. She was already feeling quite warm as her transformation started.<br />
<br />
She looked down to her hand and could already seeing the thick and insulating feathers that penguins were known for growing in. On the back of her hand the feathers were black in color while the other side of her hand had white feathers. She could also see small stubby claws growing from her fingertips, which largely retained their color. She couldn&#39;t see it, she could feel as the bones in her feet altered to feature three toes. It didn&#39;t hurt but it did feel a bit weird as some bones fused and others lengthened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ittssshh huh...ap...pen...ing,&quot; Nerthus managed slowly, finding her voice moving slowly and her lips a bit stiff. <br />
<br />
That got her up and headed over to the mirror. As she walked she also began to feel a bit of tightness in her waist, butt, and bust. It was like her pants, panties, and bra were constraining her a bit, though some of this was to be expected, as she was sure she&#39;d have tail feathers growing by now. The fact that female Animalians were curvaceous that had everything in all the right places and could often be well muscled enough to look like superstar athletes as well. It was something that Nerthus wanted and wanted to see as she walked to where the mirror hung on the wall.<br />
<br />
She arrived there to find a pair of things. One was that while her human hair was still there, her ears were visibly gone and had shrunken back into protected openings near the back of her head. At the same time, Nerthus also noted that the long monobrow of gold colored feathers had grown out and stood tall. They even moved a little bit as she tested the muscles that she&#39;d often used before her present state of transformation. The biggest thing, though, was the development of her beak. Her lips had pulled back toward the back of her mouth while her teeth seemed to fuse together and push forward. It was that sensation that had slowed her speaking and she wasn&#39;t prepared for dealing with something that wasn&#39;t as malleable as Human lips.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Your beak was the biggest thing you noticed?&quot; Scala tilted her head sideways a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh the enhancements in other areas were physically bigger...&quot; Nerthus Brusmith answered, &quot;and I definitely needed new bras and underwear after my conversion... as what I had before was too tight... particularly with my butt and tail feathers. You don&#39;t want feathers out of place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a Gila Monster Animalian... feathers aren&#39;t an issue,&quot; Scala gave a shrug, &quot;Though... I would wonder... why you don&#39;t have wings like the other bird Animalians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because penguins are flightless birds,&quot; Nerthus answered, &quot;The Animalians that have wings on their backs can all fly. Birds that can&#39;t... like penguins or ostriches wouldn&#39;t have wings. But I am good at swimming and presenting a good show at the Meat Market... and Fabina&#39;s done quite well in working with the Meat Market&#39;s owners that could lead to it being provide more than just a chance for people to see an Animalian naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scala nodded. In many ways, she&#39;d generally agreed with Nerthus on many things, and that was part of what got her into the Seven on Four night. It was to be fun and get a new start. It wasn&#39;t her fault that the hotel in Las Vegas wasn&#39;t built for Animalians. She could admit to being responsible for it, and was privately grateful for the fact that Animalia had prevented her from doing jail time, but that didn&#39;t mean she had to like the job she was given to do. The only good thing was that the city staff at the Great Hall were pretty tidy and part of her rehabilitation kept her on the day shift so that the Great Hall&#39;s building and grounds manager could keep an eye on her, which meant that Scala was often free for things in the evening, as this meeting was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... and I must say her offer is... intriguing,&quot; Scala commented. &quot;But I&#39;ll have to wait until I&#39;ve paid off my debts regarding... well... let&#39;s just say a party I had that did a little collateral damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hardly call an all night orgy in a hotel room that forced the room to need massive repairs and cleaning when you were done &quot;little,&quot; but that&#39;s just me,&quot; Nerthus commented.</p>
