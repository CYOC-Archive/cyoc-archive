<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, you took those two to jail?&quot; Molly asked me the evening after the trial ended.<br />
<br />
We were relaxing on the couch after dinner and watching a little television, though trying to stick to something light and happy. Something that wouldn't require a serious amount of attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't actually take them that far,&quot; I told her, &quot;we escorted them to the police van manned by the state's prison guards. There we transfered them over, and they took those two ranchers to prison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Molly grumbled, &quot;they deserve it for accusing you of wrestling cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had no real response to that. I agreed with her, one hundred percent, but I couldn't think of a way to sound tactful in doing so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think this will finally get Beauregard off our backs, George?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;that he'll let us be? Have our family? Succeed?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down with a heavy sigh, &quot;I don't know. He had to have spent a lot of money in legal fees and trying to bribe the judge... but from what I could see of him during the trial, I saw nothing that would indicate that he had changed his mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only sighed heavily. It was all frustrating. Mrs. Fitzpatrick, thanks to R.A.M. manipulations was expected to write daily reports on Molly's progress in the school, and while the teacher had become very supportive of her, Molly had told me that she was beginning to get tired of having to do all the extra work. It would only be a matter of time before Mrs. Fitzpatrick let Molly go to unload the workload that she shouldn't have to be doing. Molly had even told me that Mrs. Fitzpatrick was already having to consider that option because the Principal and school superintendent wouldn't remove the requirement for the reports.<br />
<br />
Molly and I knew that all of this was because of R.A.M.'s political machinations to try and get rid of her. I was privately certain that the Smiths were R.A.M. members, but Officer Barnes never found any evidence to prove it and thus couldn't present it to the City Council as a problem. R.A.M.'s hatred was so far protected by the first amendment, and no legal action could be taken because there was no evidence that R.A.M. was anything more then a club.<br />
<br />
For Molly and I, the situation was re-fighting the old civil rights movement from the 1960s. Until R.A.M.'s actions were confirmed and proved to be racist... or species favored against Molly and I, and laws were passed that directly prohibited such behavior, R.A.M. members would continue to use whatever means they felt necessary to insure that Molly and I leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we're making progress though,&quot; I told her softly, &quot;Beauregard's lost a lot of money. About all he can do is arrange little demonstrations against our presence officially.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won't matter if the little things he's doing take my job away,&quot; Molly said, sounding depressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could manage our reserve,&quot; I commented, &quot;when it does go to us. Make sure no one is poaching on it. Make sure all the plants are in good condition. Check out to see what other wildlife besides deer are out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I'm some sort of wildlife conservationist?&quot; Molly asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you could run for the school board or the superintendent's position,&quot; I offered, &quot;then you could beat them senseless from a position of power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I win,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been a favorite with all the kids,&quot; I told her, &quot;surely they'll be upset to learn that R.A.M. forced the school into firing you because a few old men don't like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the parents support R.A.M., George,&quot; Molly told me, &quot;they think that what they're doing will ultimately protect their children from me...&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and hugged her. It was the only thing I could do. Life wasn't easy or fair, but then again, it never was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be a long road, Molly,&quot; I told her as I hugged her, &quot;and we'll go down it together. And will be stronger for taking it.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next few days went rather quietly. Things remained relatively stable on the school front and Officer Barnes and I continued to go about our work. R.A.M. continued to stage protests but they weren't much more then an annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you given any thought to going to the auction?&quot; Officer Barnes asked me as we rode along on a patrol through town.<br />
<br />
&quot;What auction?&quot; I asked, &quot;the stuff we ended up getting as a result of the trial?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that stuff,&quot; Officer Barnes nodded from the front seat, &quot;you ever thought of going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm no rancher,&quot; I told him, &quot;under my care, they'd end up starving in a field... or getting some disease that I wouldn't know how to treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking more to just watch then actually participate,&quot; Officer Barnes commented in a rather friendly manner, &quot;you'd be amazed by how fast the auctioneer can go and keep track of everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't really have much interest in watching an auction,&quot; I told him, &quot;I didn't even go to the ones they had in Peoria when they had seize property as a result of some legal action.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes was about to answer when the radio came to life, cutting him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Barnes and Wayne here,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke after the dispatch officer gave the call for the unit.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a complaint of suspicious activity at the Walker Street trailer park,&quot; the dispatch officer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suspicious activity?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the caller says she's seen dog people looking in her windows and around other trailers in the area,&quot; the dispatch officer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog people...&quot; Officer Barnes said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They must be other victims from that freak show,&quot; I commented, &quot;though I don't don't remember seeing any dog people there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can she identify the breed?&quot; Officer Barnes asked carefully, &quot;or give us a description?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing more then that it has a big head,&quot; the dispatch officer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're on our way,&quot; Officer Barnes responded and we turned toward the Walker Street Trailer Park.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We drove up to the trailer  that the call had been made from to see what was going on at the time. So far, neither Officer Barnes or I had seen anything that would indicate something strange going on and it was the first rule to get a statement from the person making the complaint. Officer Barnes was the first to knock on the door. An elderly woman in a pair of slacks and a sweater came to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma'am, I'm Officer Barnes, this is Officer Wayne,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke, &quot;you called us with a complaint?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the woman said nervously, &quot;are you here to get them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get who, ma'am?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog people, like him, but dogs,&quot; the woman answered, pointing to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were they doing ma'am?&quot; Officer Barnes asked with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've been running around the back yards peaking in windows,&quot;the woman answered, &quot;one of them came right up to the back door and looked in at me watching television. Scared me half to death!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they threaten you in anyway?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No but they were big and were investigating everything,&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mischief,&quot; I mumbled in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; I said clearer, &quot;are they still in the area?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Last I saw they were up by McPherson's place,&quot; the woman pointed to a trailer across the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, ma'am, we'll go check it out,&quot; Officer Barnes told her, &quot;stay inside. We'll come back to you if we need any more information.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then slowly made our way across the street toward the trailer that the woman had pointed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you smell or hear anything?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Winds in the wrong direction to really smell anything,&quot; I answered, &quot;I think I can make out some conversation being made... but not well enough yet to know what is being said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least we know they're there,&quot; Officer Barnes shrugged and continued forward.<br />
<br />
As we reached the corner of the trailer, I could make out the actual conversation. The voices were female, and were largely commenting on whether or not they could see anything. It sounded like more like they were shopping rather then anything else. But, even if their intentions were innocent, they were still scarring people.<br />
<br />
As we rounded the corner, Officer Barnes and I were able to get our first look at who was doing this. They were indeed female. Female pit bulls and in clothing that seemed rather tight and irritating to me. And from what I could see, their clothing was also designed to show off certain features of female anatomy that had actually become smaller when they transformed, even though they were still the same height as they had always been.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to have to ask both of you to step away from that door,&quot; I spoke as I took the lead. I figured that if these two attacked, I could keep them occupied long enough for Officer Barnes to draw his weapon.<br />
<br />
Both of them jumped and began to back away slowly, as if wanting to run.<br />
<br />
&quot;We ain't done nothin'!&quot; the first said as she backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to run,&quot; I said firmly, &quot;step away from the door and come over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ain't done nothin'!&quot; the first one repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been snooping through people's windows,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;scarring half the neighborhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their tails went from a low wag to being tucked between their legs in a more submissive manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;We was told trailers here were for rent,&quot; the second spoke up nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're looking to move here?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yah,&quot; both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize you can't go around looking through windows at people,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;they'll think you're attacking them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We couldn't see no &quot;for sale&quot; signs anywhere,&quot; the first spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Properties for rent usually have a &quot;for rent&quot; sign,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; the first shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, you can't go looking in people's homes as you have,&quot; Officer Barnes said firmly, &quot;you'd need to contact the manager of the trailer park and ask him what would be available.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you there was a better way!&quot; the second said to the first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we borrow a phone?&quot; the first asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither of us have a phone on us right now,&quot; I told them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the first, a tan furred pit bull answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't want to scare nobody,&quot; the second, a black and white furred pit bull added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Officer Barnes said slowly, &quot;best to return to the sidewalks and no more looking in people's windows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where can you be reached at the present time?&quot; I asked, &quot;just in case anything comes up that would require us to be in contact with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We's down at the Motel 6 with our boyfriends,&quot; the first answered.<br />
<br />
We lead the two back to the sidewalk where the two began to lead the two back to the sidewalk. Once there, they began to move away at a slight jog away from the trailer park. Officer Barnes and I returned to our car and went on our way. The two dog people meant no harm, but there was something that had me concerned, but I wouldn't mention it until after I was sure they couldn't hear me to voice them.</p>
