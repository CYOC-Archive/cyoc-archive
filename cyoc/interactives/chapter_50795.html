<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No sooner do you leave the bathroom than you see your girlfriend, Stacy, hanging out with several of her friends. Not sure if she's still your girlfriend because of what you've just done to yourself, you wave to her and to your relief she waves back and smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, fancy seeing you here,&quot; she laughs, &quot;What are you up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; you smile back, patting your pocket and feeling the light there. You don't think you'll use it on her or her friends, but you never know, &quot;I was hanging out with Gene but he had to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww,&quot; one of Stacy's friends sighs, &quot;It's a shame we didn't get here earlier then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another of the girls giggles, &quot;Oh Jenny, you're just jealous that he's dating Melissa and not you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny rolls her eyes, &quot;I'm not jealous of Melissa, if anyone's jealous Tammy it's you. You're jealous of how last week you met up with Gene and he was wearing the same blouse as you and looked so much better in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They all burst out giggling at this and you laugh along.<br />
<br />
The fourth friend, who has remained silent so far is the first to stop laughing, she looks at you ans smiles, then turns to the others, &quot;Everyone, I just got the greatest idea!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; the others all ask at once, then start giggling again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since this is our girl's day out, and you,&quot; she points at you with a smile, &quot;Don't really look the part we'll give you a total makeover!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy shakes her head, &quot;Oh, don't be mean to him Megan. You know he's been my best friend practically forever. Just because he - &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mind,&quot; you cut her off. You did want to see how people would treat you if you made a drastic change to yourself, and while dressing up like a girl isn't exactly your idea of fun, you decide you might as well go along with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Stacy looks at you amazed, &quot;I thought you considered yourself to be more of a guy than anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug, trying to act like this is all normal to you, &quot;But at the same time, why not try something different?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is so cool!&quot; Tammy gushes, &quot;It'll be a real total makeover though.&quot;<br />
<br />
After saying this she glances pointedly at the same woman's specialty store where Gene purchased a bra earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I guess,&quot; you laugh nervously, not sure of what you've just gotten yourself into, &quot;But you'll have to pick everything out. I know nothing about what girls wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next thing you know, Stacy and her three friends have you in the store and are holding up various bras and panties, arguing animatedly about which would look best on you. Jenny seems to be interested in finding the most embarrassing undergarments, and takes great pleasure on the way both you and Stacy blush at her suggestions, skimpy and covered in ribbons and lace as they are. Megan is more for modesty, selecting the most ordinary looking things she can find, and insisting that since you're a guy it wouldn't do for you to wear anything too ornate, which Tammy repeatedly counters by bringing up Gene.<br />
<br />
In the end Stacy gets the final word, and, with the help of one of the store clerks, the girls buy a simple white training bra and a pair of skimpy, pink panties for you. Then they escort you to the changing room.<br />
<br />
You go in, and for a moment you look helplessly at the two articles of clothing, then, remembering your desire to be different until you decide to change yourself back to normal, you take off your shirt.<br />
<br />
It takes a few minutes of fumbling to get the bra on and adjust it to fit your shoulders, but once you have everything right, it's not as uncomfortable as you would have expected. Since you don't have breasts, you don't really need it, but there's something exciting about wearing a bra, like you're breaking some big taboo.<br />
<br />
Next you take off your pants and boxers, stopping for a moment to look at your minuscule manhood, then you slip the pair of panties on. Because of how your balls are practically not there at all and how your manhood is an inch long, if that, the panties are actually fit without causing any discomfort. In fact, they feel better than the boxers did, though having their soft fabric brushing against your manhood is a bit strange at first.<br />
<br />
For a moment you linger in the changing room, looking at yourself. With nothing but the bra and panties on, you look almost like a very flat chested girl.<br />
<br />
Smiling, you get dressed again, putting your boxers in the bag the clerk gave you when your new underwear were purchased, then you walk out and are greeted by delighted giggles from the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;How's it feel?&quot; Stacy asks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad at all,&quot; you reply truthfully, earning you an admiring nod from the girls.<br />
<br />
Tammy even goes a step farther, &quot;You must be really secure in your masculinity to be going through with something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; again you reassure yourself that the flashlight is still in your pocket. It's easy to be secure with the knowledge that your androgynous state will only last as long as you want it to.<br />
<br />
Next they take you to a clothing store, after having established that makeup and accessories will be too expensive to bother with unless you decide that you want to dress like a girl more often than just this one time. You truthfully tell them that so far you think once is enough and they are willing to agree with you.<br />
<br />
Again you let them argue over what would look best on you, realizing that it's half of the fun for them. This time they end up voting on what they'll get for you, a yellow blouse with a rather low neckline winning for the top you'll be wearing, and a denim mini skirt with a pattern of yellow butterflies done in sequins on it being chosen for the bottom.<br />
<br />
This time when you go into the changing room you're less hesitant. You strip down, look at yourself in your new bra and panties, then quickly put on the skirt and blouse.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, you look in the mirror, turning slowly so you can see yourself from every angle. Despite your short hair and rather boyish features, you look very much like a girl.<br />
<br />
When you leave the changing room Stacy hugs you and laughs, &quot;You look so cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
The others all nod in agreement, then Megan holds up a pair of white sandals with a slight heel to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I picked these out for you, because those sneakers totally don't do with your new outfit,&quot; she says handing them to you.<br />
<br />
You put them on without complaint, taking a few cautious steps until you get the feel for them. Then you turn around to let the girls get a good look at you, trying to pose in what you think is a sexy way.<br />
<br />
The girls all laugh and applaud.<br />
<br />
Together the group of you leave the store and as you do so, Stacy takes your hand in hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot; she says softly so that only you can hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; you wonder what she's about to say, since so far you've gotten the impression that she no longer has any interest in you as a boyfriend, thanks to the way the light has changed reality.<br />
<br />
She blushes, &quot;You look really good like this. Like maybe you should start dressing like a girl more often.&quot;</p>
