<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well,&quot; you said, &quot;I think I'd really like to know what the hell this whole werewo-&quot; you caught yourself mid-<br />
word, &quot;errr...Lycan thing is all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's exactly what it sounds like,&quot; she replied. &quot;No movie magic. What you've seen in the movies..well, it's <br />
pretty close to what we look like when we transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're being fucking serious?&quot; you asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;One hundred percent, Mr. Anderson,&quot; she replied, staring straight at you unblinking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm..&quot; you replied, making a noncommittal noise. Whether she was being serious or not, she certainly seemed <br />
to believe what she was telling you.<br />
<br />
Jenny sat down on the opposite corner of the bed, watching you closely. &quot;Now that I answered one of your <br />
questions, you should answer one of mine,&quot; she said coyly, seeming to regain a bit of the composure that she'd <br />
lost a few minutes earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fair,&quot; you replied, taking steady small sips of the strongly mixed drink. You didn't know if this was <br />
or was not part of the routine, but it didn't seem like a bad idea to start off rather friendly with the <br />
incredibly attractive (though possibly imbalanced) girl on the bed.<br />
<br />
She smiled, pleased that you were going along with her idea. &quot;I don't like the idea of having to call you Mr. <br />
Anderson..this isn't the Matrix..so, what's your first name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve,&quot; you replied. &quot;Legally it's Steven..but I only let family call me that..it's just too formal.&quot; She <br />
nodded and smiled again, satisfied with your quick answer. &quot;My turn. This company's whole thing is werewolf <br />
fetish porn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny frowned slightly. &quot;It..sounds cheap when you put it like that..but yes. I guess you could call it that. <br />
I transform and get naked, or get naked and transform..and then pleasure myself or other lycan girls, or while <br />
I'm transforming, I pleasure myself..&quot; she seemed to lose herself in her thoughts, and her nipples were <br />
clearly visible under the thin fabric. &quot;The change is..it's overwhelming..and the only answer for when it <br />
happens is to satisfy myself..&quot; one hand brushed her chest lightly, and she shivered slightly. She closed her <br />
eyes, then said very firmly. &quot;It's not just lycans that do this stuff though. There's all sorts of <br />
supernaturals here.&quot; She barely let that last bit hang in the air before she said, &quot;My turn. Are you gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You spluttered, coughing a bit on the gulp of vodka you'd just taken. &quot;WHAT?? No! Do I come off as gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny laughed, finishing her drink. &quot;Not at all. My turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! That was cheating!&quot; you protested, laughing despite yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww,&quot; she cooed at you. &quot;Finish your drink. I'll make you another one as an apology for my dirty trick. So <br />
for my next question..have you ever taken naked pictures of anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
You pounded down the half glass and handed it back to her. &quot;I took a handful of art nudes for a college class, <br />
and then for a couple girls I knew. My turn. So you're kept here like a slave? Should..I be calling the cops?&quot; <br />
You asked the second part rather quietly, feeling mildly concerned that perhaps you were being roped into the <br />
sex trade somehow.<br />
<br />
She handed you the second drink and sat closer to you, now about in the middle-edge of the bed, as opposed to <br />
the opposite corner.  &quot;I'm not a slave, Steve. Look at this room..it's my den..I'm comfortable here. They pay <br />
me well, and they take care of me. I'm here by choice. Some of the girls come and go..they have lives outside <br />
of here, but..I like it here. And that was two questions..but I think I'll let it slide this time..&quot; she <br />
smiled at you, kicking her feet a little, reminding you of a kid. She took a longer drink this time. &quot;So..were <br />
any of the girls you photographed naked your girlfriends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One was at the time..the other two weren't. They were just friends who wanted to be edgy and do a little nude <br />
stuff.&quot; You drank more quickly this time than the first drink. This was just a strange job for a strange group <br />
on a strange night. Drinking was definitely making things a little easier.  &quot;So...if you're a lycan..how'd you <br />
become a lycan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no 'if'..I AM a lycan. I was born this way.” Her voice was firm. She definitely believed what she <br />
was telling you. She gulped down her second drink, and gestured to your glass. “Drink up.” You didn't even <br />
think about it, gulping yours down as well as she reached for your glass and started making you a third drink. <br />
You were pretty buzzed at this point. “Did you do any art stuff that might have gotten Ms. Adair thinking <br />
you'd be a good fit?”<br />
<br />
You pondered that for a moment as she handed you another full glass and then sat right next to you. “No..I <br />
mean..I'd taken a few pictures at a Halloween party that I posted, and then if she got really nosy, she might <br />
have seen that I liked some werewolf art pictures that I'd found on Deviantart..but that would have only been <br />
if she'd really been investigating me.”<br />
<br />
Jenny smirked at you. “She does that. Ms. Adair likes to know who she's bringing on board.”<br />
<br />
You looked at her, acutely aware of how buzzed you were now. “Umm...sooo..this gig's like a three day a month <br />
thing, right? Because of the full moon?”<br />
<br />
Jenny shook her head. “Nope. I can change any time I want to, really. I mean..the moon kind of forces me to <br />
shift, but if I'm not in direct light, I can hold off for a long time even on those nights. The other <br />
girls..well, they can change at other times too..the company has ways of..inducing a change in any of the <br />
shifters they have on the payroll.” Jenny leaned in and sniffed you again, causing you to shudder hard. “Those <br />
pictures that you liked..were they of girls turning into lycans?”<br />
<br />
Despite yourself, you blushed. “Yeah. Mostly drawings, like comic book style..but a few manips as well. Not <br />
just lycans though..some were turning into big cats.”<br />
<br />
“Naked?” Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
“It's my turn,” you protested, blushing harder. You had no idea why you were blushing; you knew there was no <br />
reason to be embarrassed, particularly not with a fetish model right next to you.<br />
<br />
“I'll make it up to you,” Jenny said quietly, turning your head and giving you a little kiss on the lips, then <br />
wrapping an arm around the back of your neck and deepening the kiss before breaking it and whispering in your <br />
ear, “So were the girls naked?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah..” you admitted, turning your head back to find her lips in another kiss, which she returned eagerly. <br />
The kiss was broken by the two of you being startled into good behavior by an intercom buzzing in the room. <br />
<br />
The terse voice of Ms. Adair broke the intimacy. “Jenny, is everything all right?”<br />
<br />
Jenny gave you an apologetic look. “Uhh...yes, Ms. Adair. I was just getting Steve..err.. Mr. Anderson up to <br />
speed,” she said, leaning over to a bedside table and responding on the intercom.<br />
<br />
There was a long pause. “Have you shown him yet?”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked almost apologetically toward you. “Not..not yet.”<br />
<br />
“Do I need to have another girl handle this?” Ms. Adair's voice was icy and professional, and clearly <br />
displeased.<br />
<br />
“No ma'am,” Jenny replied softly. “I'll do it right away.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Jenny. That will be all.”</p>
