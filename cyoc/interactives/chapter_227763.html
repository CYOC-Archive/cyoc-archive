<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie kept walking, pushing through her tween years. She got taller and thinner as the last of her baby fat drained out. As she finally hit her teen years at 13, she felt a tingle in her chest. She looked down to see that her nipples were making slight indentations in her tank top. As she walked, her nipples rubbed against her tank top more, feeling more sensitive as they did. The areas around them started getting more puffy as tissue began forming. &quot;I&#39;m growing boobies,&quot; said Katie, her mind expanding to explain what puberty is. The discomfort faded as a training bra appeared under her tank top, comfortably cradling her nascent breasts.<br />
<br />
The beginning of puberty spurred Katie to walk even more, wondering how big she was going to get. As she continued through her teen years, she gained more height. Her legs became more shapely as her thighs and hips start filling out. She could feel her butt growing into a more appealing shape. Her tank top pulled up more, showing her belly button. Her training bra became a proper bra as her breasts expanded, putting her into the upper B&#39;s. Katie&#39;s face got prettier as her lips became fuller and her face started losing its roundness. Her hair grew longer before a band put it into a ponytail. At 16, Katie was becoming a looker and she knew it. &quot;Sweet sixteen and ready to drive,&quot; she said proudly, her voice not sounding as high-pitched as before.<br />
<br />
16 looked good, but there wasn&#39;t quite enough freedom for Katie. She pushed onward, going through the last of her high school years. She gained a little more height as her legs grew even more shapely. She could feel her hips and rear growing out to a childbearing form and a tingle through her groin told her she was fully ready to have children of her own. Her tank top fully slid up to reveal her flat stomach as it merged with her bra to become a sports bra. Her breasts swelled up to C cups as her cleavage became more displayed. Lipstick and earrings appeared as she pushed past what would have been her high school graduation. &quot;I&#39;m a legal adult,&quot; said Katie proudly, her voice dropping into a lovely tenor. At 18, she was now free to pursue adult interests.<br />
<br />
18 may be the age where adult access is unlocked, but 21 is where the fun really starts. Katie pushed herself to reach that. Puberty had a last few gifts to give to her before it finished. Another two inches of height finished her growth. Her butt, no, her ass was now a perfect peach that any guy would look at. Though plenty of them would also be watching her tits especially as they swelled into the D class. Wilder thoughts entered Katie&#39;s mind as new possibilities open. &quot;I&#39;m going to party hard tonight,&quot; said the 21-year-old college girl.<br />
<br />
Though Katie was a fully grown woman with a sexy figure, something intrigued her. After all her walking, her muscles weren&#39;t nearly as big as she expected them to be. She was hardly out of shape, but she would have thought all her walking would be reflected more. &quot;Let&#39;s see if I can work on that,&quot; she said as she kept walking. As she walked, she gained more memories of fitness courses and knowledge about physical regiments. The changes soon became noticeable. Her shapely legs grew more toned as the years of walking became physically present. Her arms also thickened as years of workouts were added on. Her exposed midriff rippled before her abs pushed out, becoming more defined until a hard six-pack was formed. Katie felt a rush of power as she became a female bodybuilder at 25.<br />
<br />
A small nagging thought came to Katie&#39;s attention. Her mom was bound to be waiting for her after she finished in the arcade. Of course, Katie was now way too old to possibly be her daughter. More likely, she&#39;ll be her sister, her younger sister. The thought rankled Katie a little over her former mother holding seniority over her. Maybe just a little more to meet her mother&#39;s age. A few more years meant more muscles being built. Her legs thickened even more, yet she retained enough to keep them from looking grotesque. Her arms grew even more bigger, a very considerable amount of strength being added. Her abs didn&#39;t look just sculpted, they looked carved. She had been able to build up a legendary 8-pack to the envy of both men and women. At 30, no one was going to be pushing Katie around. &quot;Wait until &#39;Mom&#39; sees her twin,&quot; she said smugly.<br />
<br />
But then a thought occurred to her.  Yes, she is the same age as her mother, but why stop there.  Why be a twin when she can be older then her, more dominant then her.  She can be the one in charge for once and would tell her own mother on what to do.  That would put her in her place.  With a smirk on her lips, Katie said to herself, &quot;Fuck it.  Let&#39;s put mom in her place!&quot;  And with that, she continued to walk on the treadmill as the forest continues to to forwards on the screen.  Looking at the counter, she watches with glee as she could see her age racing through her thirties.  At the same time, her body was passing her prime as father time was slowly stripping her of her Adonis like body.<br />
<br />
Her breasts soon grew out into a pair of melon size DDs but they were slowly dipping down as if the air they were starting to slowly sag.  Her sculpted abs started to fade away as a small paunch poke out while her sides were gaining a muffin tuff, spilling out the waist band of her gym shorts.  And muscular arms and legs started to soften up as while strong, was showing age.  Her beautiful face was also aging as well as faint lines appeared around her eyes and mouth before they deepen into laugh lines while dark circles appeared under her eyes.  The band of her pony tail snapped as her luscious hair cascaded down to the mid back before reverting itself up to her head, restyling into a bob cut that frames her face.  As the hair started to get duller, a few gray stands started to appear on her head before on the top to form a line.  Reaching the back of her head, it looked like Katie has a gray streak on top of her head that, while makes her old, at the same time beautiful.<br />
<br />
As Katie&#39;s body was aging, her attire was altering to match it.  The bottom hem of her sport bra grew downwards to cover her stomach as the shoulder straps thinned until they were non existence, giving her a strapless green top with ample cleavage.  Her gym shorts grew down her legs and the fabric became Demin, with a zipper and button appearing and a belt looking round her waistline, creating a pair of blue jeans.  The laces of her trainers untie themselves as the laces slithered out and rested on the moving treadmill, vanishing away once they reached the end of it.  The shoes themselves grew upwards to the mid thighs and covered the pants as they turned black with a zipper on the side, creating a pair of cozy boots.   A red business vest was magically woven from existence as the fabric went up her arms and down her body until it stopped below her top, making her look professional.   Make up was automatically applied on her face to cover up her laugh lines as she plucked her lips and the color changed to cherry red.  Her fit bit watch soon turned into a Rolex watch on one arm while a few bracelets appeared on the other.  A silver necklace wrapped around her neck with a green gemstone in the front nestled between her huge boobs.  A guchi bag when magically appeared on her shoulder strap and it was automatically filled with personal items like a wallet with cash, make up back, a collection of keys, and other assortments of things a woman needs. <br />
 And to top it all off, a golden wedding ring with a green diamond appeared on her index finger, signifying that she was married.  After some walking, what was a once 8-year-old girl with a future ahead of her turned into a middle age 40 year old professional woman.<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the counter hit forty and decided to stop it.  &quot;Might as well end my walk.  Wouldn&#39;t want to get too old that I would turn to dust.&quot; she said with her voice lower and has a husky tone.  Hitting the stop button, the treadmill slowed down before it came to a halt.  Stepping off, she got a good look at herself in every angle and was surprised to see how much she has changed.  &quot;Hmm...  Pity that I had to sacrifice quite a body to be the oldest sibling.  But it will serve my &#39;little sister&#39; right for bossing me around.<br />
<br />
Looking to her hand, she could see the wedding ring on her finger and realized something else.  &quot;And I&#39;m married too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the mental and reality change was catching up with her.  She remembered going to multiple competitions and winning so much prize money.  She remembered meeting her boyfriend during that time which he was a fitness instructor.  She remembered the two opening up a gym with that prize money.  Then there was a the dates, the proposal, the marriage.  Where she gave birth to a baby girl eight years ago.  Branching out into health products that were so successful, she had created her own enterprise.  And then finally, becoming the CEO of her own company with a line of healthy foods and exercise equipment.<br />
<br />
Remembering all of that, she gave off a coy laugh and said, &quot;Guess all that walking on the treadmill really paid off.  I&#39;m old, hot, married, and my own boss to boot.  Oh...  Kel is going to be so jealous of me when we meet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling proud of how much she changed, Katie wondered how to cement this new body and life.</p>
