<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I made a little error with my previous post. Looking back at older chapters, the Nozdrins had another girl instead of a boy.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizavita Nozdrin has had her life changed in ways she couldn&#39;t have imagined. Quite fortunately, those changes have been for the better. Once, she had been a teenage girl living in an increasingly-totalitarian Russia with a pituitary tumor that made her both taller than normal and gave her oversized breasts. Those might be desirable traits for some people, but developing them so early in puberty made Ellie an object of ridicule among her peers.<br />
<br />
Elly had been picked by the Russian government to go to America as part of a student exchange program, specifically to Lyre, Nevada. This was Elly&#39;s chance to have her tumor treated before it became a ticking time bomb. She ended up becoming a rhinoceros to match her size. Of course, then Russia&#39;s political relations with the rest of the world soured. Elly didn&#39;t mind not returning to her homeland. Even she could see America was the better place to be. And fortunately, she was able to get her parents to formally immigrate here and get converted. Their family only began to grow from there.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Elly was out in the waiting room with her father. Her mother was in the middle of giving birth. Elly wasn&#39;t sure if she&#39;ll be getting a new sister or brother yet. She was pretty sure her father was expecting a son. Even in the modern world, Russian men expect to have strong Russian sons. It must have been awkward to not just have only a daughter, but one who developed a medical condition. Her father deserved more and it was thanks to the Animalian virus he was getting another chance.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the doctor came out and said, &quot;Congratulations, Mr. Nozdrin. You have a beautiful, healthy daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, but vhat about my new sibling?&quot; asked Elly.<br />
<br />
The doctor smiled and said, &quot;Also a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly turned to her father and said, &quot;Papa, I&#39;m sorry. I know you vanted a son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aleksi just smiled and said, &quot;Vhat&#39;s there to be sorry about? Now I have two lovely daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked into the delivery room where a tired Ivana was holding her new daughter. The baby was making surprisingly high-pitched sounds, but Elly had learned that rhinos actually sound that way when they were communicating to each other. &quot;Aleksi, Elizavita, come meet little Sasha,&quot; said Ivana.<br />
<br />
Elly lifted an eyebrow and asked, &quot;You still veren&#39;t sure if it vould be a boy or girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a good Russian name, if gender-neutral,&quot; said Aleksi, &quot;She is still Russian even if she is born here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps she vill see Russia someday,&quot; said Ivana, &quot;Vunce it has cleaned up its act, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until certain people are out of office, that&#39;s unlikely to happen anytime soon,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; agreed Aleksi, &quot;But she can learn good Russian culture here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly looked down at her new little sister. She always wanted one, though the age gap between was much bigger than when she first imagined it. Still, the important thing was that her parents had another chance to raise a daughter without health problems or without the government breathing down their necks. Or less of that than usual.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Though it wasn&#39;t just Elly&#39;s parents whose lives were changing. When Elly first met Rod, he hadn&#39;t made a very good impression. He accused her of being a Russian spy and she shoulder-checked him flat onto his back. Of course, a lot of his aggression came from the fact that he was still going through RHS and having been gay before made him more agitated as his sexuality shifted to be more bi. Rod&#39;s temperament improved a lot after Elly knocked the wind out of his sails.<br />
<br />
After that, the two of them became regular workout partners. Eventually, they were able to progress to... Well, it wasn&#39;t quite romance. While Rod had turned into a rhino, none of the other gay men chose to do so. There wasn&#39;t any rule against Rod being with other species if mating wasn&#39;t on the agenda, but being a rhino gave him limited options. By that point, Elly was already 18 and in her last year of high school. She had her own urges and Rod needed release. It was a mutually-beneficial relationship, one that didn&#39;t look as leery in Lyre as it would anywhere else. It was one that continued even after Elly graduated and her parents moved to Lyre. Elly liked Rod, but she didn&#39;t expect them to be any more than friends. But that changed one evening.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It has been one of their workout sessions. While running laps was one thing they regularly did, there were still other muscles to work on. And being rhinos, they can lift some pretty heavy weights. Elly thought it was rather odd that Rod wanted to start with sit-ups. While Animalians had what humans might consider super strength, at least in comparison, that didn&#39;t make sit-ups any easier for them than anyone else. Still, a change in routine was something to keep fresh when it comes to workouts.<br />
<br />
Elly grunted as she raised her torso up and down. She already had a decent set of abs, but it was still tiring after a while. Rod was spotting her, holding her feet down as she worked. She was lifting herself up for the 30th and last rep when he saw Rod was holding a small black box in his hand. That Elly pause. &quot;Rod, vhat is that?&quot; asked Ellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elly, we&#39;ve know each other for a few years. You&#39;ve become a fine woman, in ways I never thought women could be. I know we&#39;ve mostly seen each other as friends and maybe we want to be more than that. So, Elizavita Nozdrin, would you consider allowing me to be your husband?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly just blinked. She wasn&#39;t unhappy about the proposal, but she certainly wasn&#39;t expecting it. She was just numb with shock. &quot;Rod...I don&#39;t know vhat to think,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it too much?&quot; asked Rod with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, just give me time to think it over,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
The rest of the workout, she processed it. As the shock wore off, she found herself warming to the idea. She and Rod knew each other quite intimately by now. He had already met her parents and they mostly seemed to approve of him, up to the point where they were unmarried. His family was long gone. Yes, Rod was much older than her, but age gaps are easy to overlook in Animalia. Heck, they were already living together. The only real difference is that they haven&#39;t formally referred to each other as a couple or gone on actual dates. But today&#39;s couples were so much different than what things were like 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Really, the only changes would be to her last name.<br />
<br />
So by the time they had finished their workout session, Elly said, &quot;Ok, Rod, I have thought this through and I think, yes, I vill agree to let you be my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure-&quot; started Rod before Elly planted a big kiss on him. There was enough clearance for them to kiss, though their horns rubbed against each other. The other people in the weight room applauded. Elly broke the kiss and said, &quot;Of course, ve vill need to run this by my parents first. I don&#39;t imagine they&#39;ll say no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope not,&quot; said Rod.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Actually, Mr. and Mrs. Nozdrin were delighted that Rod was finally going to marry their daughter. It was a bit odd that Rod decided to take Elly&#39;s family name instead of the other way around. Rod didn&#39;t have much to look back on from his old life and he liked Elly&#39;s name anyways. Of course, since Elly&#39;s family was already in Lyre and Rod didn&#39;t have any left, it would be a small wedding. So they took advantage of the Mass Matrimonial that took in place in June 2024. Their honeymoon was mostly a tour in Las Vegas. Thanks to Vegas being so close to Lyre and plenty of Animalians attending UNLV, there were some rooms that were accommodating for a pair of rhino Animalians. And their honeymoon suite was put to good use.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t the first time Elly and Rod have had sex together. But it&#39;s taken on a whole new meaning now. What had once been about sexual release had become far more intimate. This wasn&#39;t just sating lust, this was making love. The two were very turned on as they finished removing their clothes. Elly gently pushed Rod back onto the bed, which was a larger bed meant for larger Animalians. &quot;So, how does it feel to finally have me completely?&quot; asked Elly posing in front of her new husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it&#39;s kinda ironic,&quot; said Rod, &quot;My family would have wanted to see me settled down with a wife a long time ago. Of course, I never had the interest in that or the opportunity to express what I was really interested in. Now here I am, doing what they wanted. Of course, they never would have thought my wife would be a Russian rhino.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the beauty of the Animalian virus,&quot; said Elly, &quot;It creates new opportunities for everyvun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I ever told you how sexy your accent can get?&quot; asked Rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I hope you&#39;ve been practicing your Russian,&quot; said Elly before she started stroking Rod&#39;s rod, &quot;Because if you&#39;re going to be a Nozdrin, you vill need to talk like a Nozdrin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, Mrs. Nozdrin,&quot; said Rod with a moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Mrs. Nozdrin is my mother,&quot; said Elly, &quot;Though there is one vay I&#39;d like to outdo her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; asked Rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;I vant to see if I can have a son before her,&quot; said Elly.<br />
<br />
Rod sat up straight, &quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vhen you are ready, of course,&quot; said Elly, &quot;I do think you vould make a good father someday.&quot; Then she started lowering herself onto her dick, &quot;And there vill be plenty of time to vork on your technique.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod moaned as he entered his wife for the first time. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if he was ready to have a son just yet, but he couldn&#39;t deny how sexy Elly was. Once, he had no interest in women. But now, her amazonian muscles and large breasts turned him on more than he thought possible. The two rhinos groaned as they really made love to each other. It was a very twisted road that lead them to this point, but the destination was worth it.</p>
