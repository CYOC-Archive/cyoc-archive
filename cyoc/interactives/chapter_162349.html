<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff entered everything in and hit confirm then waited for a few moments before the chronivac made a &#39;ping&#39; sound, and the phrase,&quot;Fantasy Lover&quot; popped up. Jeff paused for a moment trying to process this but before he could the transformation had already begun.<br />
<br />
First Jeff’s body started to grow, and he gained a few inches in height but then he started to shrink and lose the inches he had just gained. Jeff blushed unsure what was going on before he turned around and saw the walls of his room changing color to a bright cyberpunk purple. While this happened Jeff’s clothes were slowly changing and suddenly fur started popping up all over his body, and his arms grew daintier as his shoulders grew narrower losing their broad form.<br />
<br />
Jeff covered his mouth trying his best not to scream now as his bed vanished and in its place was a large comfortable looking couch, and on each end of the couch what looked like microphones appeared, high quality ones too like professional youtubers or twitch streamers would use. A bit puzzled by this at first Jeff turned back to his computer desk and saw that it had been extremely upgraded. His PC had two screens now and a hard drive that looked like it could run high quality games at 1080p at 120fps.<br />
<br />
Jeff was so awestruck by this he almost didn’t notice the hot pink fur spreading up his arms, and the two mounds inflating on his chest. But when he saw these he screamed in the high pitched voice of a woman, which prompted him to cover his mouth again only to realize that his nose felt wet and his mouth was pushing out forwards. &quot;Huh?! What the...?!&quot; Jeff cried again before he felt an unsettling feeling between his legs along with a loud squelch accompanied by two popping feelings.<br />
<br />
Immediately Jeff reached into his pants and felt his fingers glide across and press against a plump and soft set of lips between his legs. His heart dropped, or rather hers, and pulling her hand out she saw that her jeans were getting shorter, shrinking up to her upper thighs as her briefs turned into panties, and revealing his legs were completely covered in that same hot pink fur. Jeff’s shirt was shrinking too, pulling up to reveal a slim and smooth furry stomach with a piercing on her belly button. Jeff’s breasts were still swelling as her shirt grew a bit tight before her socks disappeared and a sports bra appeared and cushioned her breasts. At this point, Jeff’s hips and ass were swelling as her ears moved atop her head, and her teeth grew larger, sharper, and her tongue was much longer now.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at his hands and saw that they looked like large paws now, and his feet were literal paws, digitigrade too without heels so she’d and she whimpered feeling the embarrassment of walking everywhere practically on tip-toes now. Additional piercings appeared on Jeff’s ears and face, she had one on her lip and another on her right eyebrow now and she whined and stood up on her new legs, before almost immediately grabbing her chair for support.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What is dad into?!&quot; Jeff asked herself,&quot;I-I need a mirror!&quot; The moment she said that she felt something pull itself out of her pants and fluff out and curl above her rear. Looking back Jeff was a tail like one she’d see on a wolf or dog curl up and rest on her rump. She then sighed,&quot;Great... just... great....&quot; before she made her way slowly to the bathroom, fighting the weight distribution on her new body as well as her new paws, but after a minute or two she managed to get across the hall to it.<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately locked the door and sighed before walking up to the sink and washing her eyes before looking up at her reflection. Staring back at Jeff was an extremely attractive husky furry girl where all the black fur was dyed bright hot pink. She wore a sleeveless top with spaghetti straps with the phrase “Game On!&quot; on the front, and the words were stretched out a bit from the sheer size of her bosom. She wore a pair of cutoff shorts over her dummy thicc frame Her ass was equally as large and plump, giving her a perfect hourglass figure, combined with her dummy thicc body and all Jeff did for the next 10 minutes was stare at her reflection.<br />
<br />
When Jeff finally willed herself to pinch her arm to check if this was real, she spotted a ring on her finger, an engagement ring, and she knew was it was instantly somehow. It was then that Jeff realized that the changes weren’t just physical, but mental too, and she felt this new personality she had emerge along with its memories. Jeff still had his own and still felt like himself, but he could only physically do anything using the mind and personality of his new body.<br />
<br />
Jeff then took a deep breath and sighed, thinking to himself,&quot;Okay.... maybe this isn’t totally bad... I’ve always wondered what being a girl would be like, right? Could I reverse this...? But..... what if I.... I’m not sure if I want to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook her head and whilst trying to make up her mind she walked back to her room, or what could be considered her former room now, and looked at her stats on the chronivac. She waited for the machine to scan her and after it did it displayed the following with his former stats in parentheses.<br />

<br />
As Jeff scrolled through the stat’s her former father, now fiancé, walked in the room and placed his hands on her hips, which surprised her and made her yelp before looking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby girl~&quot; Mike said with a smile, and suddenly Jeff, or Jessy shouted,&quot;Mikey!&quot; Before bolting up and jumping up, wrapping her arms and legs around him and rapidly licking his face. &quot;I missed you at work, have you been home long? I learned how to cook something new for you from YouTube!&quot; Jeff barked then started panting happily as she wagged her tail.<br />
<br />
Jeff did blush a bit especially when Mike decided to support her weight by cupping her bubbly rear and kissing her neck. &quot;I’ve been home for about thirty minutes, work’s been... well unsatisfactory and everyone seems too lackadaisical lately, you know?&quot; Mike exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Jeff tilted her head,&quot;Uh.... Laxi-.... Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, sorry.... I mean I’ve been doing more than everyone else and I need a break because they’re lazy,&quot; Mike exclaimed<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh....&quot; Jeff nodded then giggled,&quot;Mikey, you need to get out more and have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fun like what exactly? You know how busy I am babe, life’s rough,&quot; Mike stated <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay boomer, just like, let me show you later okay?&quot; Jeff booped him on the nose then giggled,&quot;Remember we get married soon and that means a big romantic honeymooooon~&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike blushed as Jeff returned her feet to the ground, and he scratched his head,&quot;Well uh... I guess you could show me what you millennials do for fun then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GREAT!!!&quot; Jeff barked,&quot;Now let me cook you something nice,&quot; To which Mike nodded and as Jeff turned towards the door and shook her ass a bit like Mike always liked she accidentally knocked it into her gaming chair, which bumped into her desk and hit the microphone on top of it, knocking it over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.... heh.... oops....&quot; Jeff muttered and Mike laughed,&quot;I’ll clean it up, if you wanna cheer me up then just focus on that, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!!&quot; Jeff barked then playfully booped him again and said,&quot;boomer,&quot; then laughed and walked downstairs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometime later Jeff/Jessica was cooking and humming some videogame soundtrack theme she couldn’t remember the name of to herself. Meanwhile in Jeff’s mind he felt sort of humiliated to be reduced to basically a gaming bimbo who was also ditzy, and as much as he wanted to change that all he could do right now was do what her mind wanted to do. Though, it was all too bad, at least in Jeff’s part of the mind, but he didn’t know his dad was such a pervert, no doubt Jessy was just his trophy wife. Nonetheless Jeff wanted to cheer up his dad, and all Jessy wants is Mike’s affection and to make him feel good so his plan at least sort of succeeded right? Besides Jeff was surprised at how well she was doing in the kitchen, then again Jeff felt like this was more talent on Jessy’s part, and she was a really flirty and playful creature.<br />
<br />
When the food was done Jessy plated the food and served it to Mike, sitting next to him and eating too. Mike seemed to like it a lot, and without a word he suddenly just took her hand and pulled her into a passionate kiss, making Jeff blush heavily. &quot;You cook like an angel, and you have the body of ten of the most gorgeous, you know that right?&quot; Mike exclaimed<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well...&quot; Jeff paused then grinned,&quot;Older men like you kinda deserve someone like me, don’t ya think? Or is it that you want something else besides the food~?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, how about I throw you a bone later, a nice big, juicy, meaty one~?&quot; Mike replied<br />
<br />
Then to Jeff’s horror, the next words out of her own mouth were,&quot;...&quot;</p>
