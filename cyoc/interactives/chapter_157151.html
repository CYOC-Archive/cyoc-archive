<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After coaxing Vicki out Naomi, Kathy, Cindy, and Vicki were out to the park. Cindy decided to abuse her little body&#39;s tolerance for unhealthy food and metabolism by getting herself triple deep fried bacon kabobs with a medium slushy that seemed endless to her small body. Naomi and Kathy ended up getting salads out of their body&#39;s habits, and Vicki just got herself some chicken nuggets. The kids ate fast and ran to the jungle gym while Kathy and Naomi nibbled from a nearby bench watching the two kids play.<br />
Kathy chuckled and said &quot;Cute... You know almost makes you forget one&#39;s really a middle aged japanese teacher and the other&#39;s a delinquent high schooler.&quot;  <br />
Naomi looked confused &quot;Vicki&#39;s a delinquent? But she seems so scared of everything.&quot; <br />
Kathy shrugged her shoulders and said &quot;She was a big girl. It&#39;s easy to not be scared when your stronger than everyone around you.&quot; Vicki giggled as she got her small sandcastle to stay up even when she scribbled a small pattern on it&#39;s side. <br />
Cindy helping out said &quot;It&#39;s coming together well. I&#39;ll start on a moat!&quot; Cindy left to fill a bucket with water meanwhile a high school student without a car was rushing through the park as a shortcut. Cutting right through she jumped from a wall Vicki had been playing near and landed on her castle splashing Vicki with a bit of sand that got in her eye making her cry. The teenager was known as Ronda, and while she was one of the popular girls she was pretty physically active and for some reason was a fellow boxing club member with Vicki. <br />
Ronda said &quot;Oh sorry kid, didn&#39;t se-... Wait your Vicki aren&#39;t you? I think I remember that Chronos girl shrink you down. God this is hilarious.&quot; <br />
Vicki&#39;s habits as a bigger girl made her stand up and puff out her chest and scream &quot;APOLOGIZE OR I&#39;LL POUND YOU!&quot; Ronda wasn&#39;t amused. <br />
She responded by saying &quot;I thought I just did, but I think you should get a better look at yourself. Do you honestly think you could force me to do anything as a toddler?&quot; <br />
Kathy had came to Vicki&#39;s defense and said &quot;Hey Ronda, knock it off with your teasing.&quot; <br />
Ronda got a look at Kathy and said &quot;Oh so you need mommy there to save you? Woulda thought the top boxer would be tougher than that.&quot; she chuckled and said &quot;You couldn&#39;t get yourself back to normal Kathy? Wow that was one powerful prayer from Saya...&quot; Vicki&#39;s fear was strong... her childish instincts were telling her to run, and her teen memories told her everything Ronda probably could do to her if she really wanted to beat her up. <br />
Still she approached Ronda again yelling &quot;You Bitch!&quot; and Ronda simply turned and stomped her foot kicking up sand causing Vicki to retreat immediately scared. <br />
Ronda chuckled and said &quot;How cute, well I&#39;ll be seeing you at boxing club.&quot; Cindy came with her bucket of water and Ronda having not taken any of Cindy&#39;s classes said &quot;...Interesting meeting you here with your new toddler friend. Well I must be going.&quot; She then sprinted off to go wherever she was heading. Naomi approached the group now that the scary girl was gone. <br />
Kathy asked &quot;Are you alright Vicki?&quot; <br />
Cindy asked &quot;What happened to our castle?&quot; Before Naomi could add in anything Vicki fell to the ground and let out a wail as she cried. <br />
Kathy asked &quot;What&#39;s wrong, did she stomp on your feet or something?!?&quot; <br />
Vicki sniffled and said &quot;I&#39;m sick of this... I&#39;m so small and everything is just so TERRIFYING... I have no idea how I&#39;ll feel if I ever get back to normal...&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Don&#39;t worry, as soon as Jane sob-&quot; <br />
Vicki cut her off and said &quot;It&#39;s just getting to me though... getting crushed by the drunks... being shrunk... A giant Yumi chasing me... that Fucking Dream!&quot; Kathy chuckled a bit at hearing the toddler curse and Cindy gave her as much of a glare as a little girl can give. <br />
Cindy said &quot;Well talking about your problems will help, wanna talk?&quot;<br />
vicki nodded and said &quot;...last night... I started as a big girl... strong and unstoppable... I was in a ring with Ronda and as much as she tried to hurt me everything she threw at me barely did anything... One or two jabs would knock her down... or at least they should&#39;ve. My first hit, then as I threw my second... It missed as my arm shrank... then the rest of my shrank... I&#39;d still try to fight but I&#39;d keep getting smaller... Nothing I could throw would do anything to Ronda... Everyone left me and... then it was her turn to attack...&quot; Vicki cried to herself a bit muttering &quot;no... I just  want mommy now...&quot; Naomi patted her on the head. <br />
Kathy said &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Let&#39;s get back to the Mavis&#39; home and then I&#39;ll help bring you home to mommy. If Jane&#39;s sober enough you can be big and strong again.&quot; <br />
Vicki sniffled and muttered &quot;ok...&quot; and allowed Naomi to pick her up and carry her piggyback style as she calmed down. <br />
<br />
When they arrived home they saw that John had been conscious long enough to turn Naomi, Yumi, and Jess back to normal. However Naomi had been prompted to give John one of her lectures that bored him to unconsciousness again... Yumi brought Naomi and Jess back with her as Kathy&#39;s home was on the way back, and Dolly and Kathy went out to grab some burgers. Coincidentally Vicki had been in Cindy&#39;s class so they decided to tackle Vicki&#39;s homework with some help. <br />
<br />
Cindy taught japanese and after finishing with some pointers and references Cindy was surprised saying &quot;Wow, you really demolished some of those harder problems... That&#39;s an A.&quot; <br />
Vicki chuckled and said &quot;Arigatou gozaimasu, Mavis Sensei. Sore wa chodo nanrakano riyu de totemo imi ga arimashita!&quot; <br />
Cindy thought and said &quot;Maybe it&#39;s because your body and brain are both so young it&#39;s easier to learn new languages... may be something to look into.&quot; <br />
Vicki not really caring about all that scientific stuff said &quot;I&#39;m hungry, when are they coming back with food?&quot; The front door opened and in stepped the two adults in the group. <br />
Kathy said &quot;We&#39;re back and we brought a friend Vicki.&quot; A teenager with a punk outfit and long red hair came out from behind them. Nessa was basically Vicki&#39;s best friend and fellow delinquent... Well at least she tried to be a delinquent but was a little too nice to really be called a delinquent, and didn&#39;t go far enough with ditching classes. <br />
Vicki muttered &quot;Ne-&quot;<br />
The Nessa yelled out &quot;THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE!?! COULDN&#39;T YOU HAVE CALLED OR-&quot; Vicki had enough big girls yelling at her and ran away screaming. <br />
Cindy asked &quot;Why did you scream at her? She&#39;s been scared shitless several tiems today and we just got her calmed down!&quot; <br />
Nessa said &quot;Hey All I knew was that Vicki went to go fix Ms. Stone and then disappeared. No calls or anything, and I thought she may have been erased from time or something.&quot; <br />
John having been in her room started going down the stairs and asked &quot;Wha&#39;s with the screaming?&quot; <br />
Nessa had put together rumors and knew that little squirt was the Chronos Priestess and said &quot;This is your fault little girl!&quot; and was about to charge to grab the priestess before she started growing younger. Not to Vicki&#39;s toddler size, but more to a tween. <br />
Cindy asked &quot;What did you do Jane?&quot;<br />
John replied &quot;Well after Vicki threatened to beat me up I developed a regression reflex.&quot;<br />
Nessa said &quot;So what are you doing to me? making me a baby?&quot;<br />
John shook her head and said &quot;No... just made you significantly younger so you&#39;d be more focused on that than beating me up.&quot; <br />
Nessa said &quot;Well then make me grow back up or I&#39;ll... umm...&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;This may be great! Nessa go after Vicki calmly and just talk. She&#39;s gone through a lot and being smaller may make Vicki calmer.&quot; Nessa seeing the logic agreed, she cared for Vicki and her comfort was more important than some silly vengeance right now. <br />
<br />
Vicki had slammed herself in the bathroom and huddled herself in an empty tub. She asked herself &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you Vicki?&quot; Nessa saw the door close and knocked. <br />
Nessa said &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
Vicki asked &quot;What here to assert dominance as well?!?&quot; <br />
Nessa asked &quot;Wha? what do you-&quot;<br />
&quot;Ronda came to the park, kicked down our sand castle and...&quot; Vicki just cried to herself softly. <br />
Nessa heard the gentle weeping and muttered &quot;that bitch...&quot; then told Vicki &quot;I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s snitching or not we need to report her.&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s what Mavis Sensei said but...&quot; <br />
&quot;but what?&quot; In response Nessa heard Vicki start crying some more &quot;What&#39;s the matter Vicki?!?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I can be a big girl anymore...&quot; <br />
Nessa was flabbergasted &quot;What are you saying? your the biggest toughest girl out there, You beat up Ronda in boxing matches all the time. Heck even in the winter snow you still wear that tattered up uniform like it&#39;s the hottest day in summer!&quot; <br />
Sniffling Vicki said &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m not sure I can really live as Big Tori... I don&#39;t know I just feel too much like little victoria.&quot; John was seeing what was going on and to see if she could help when she heard Vicki&#39;s words.<br />
Nessa said &quot;I don&#39;t get it. your still Vicki I&#39;m sure if you grew back to normal.&quot; <br />
John let herself be known and said &quot;Sorry for ease dropping, but I think I get what Vicki&#39;s trying to say. Like everyone&#39;s been trying to call me Jane to make my transition more comfortable. In my mind this Jane is my feminine self that does all sorts of girly self. Yet I still just feel like my old self John, and I just cannot see myself as Jane. I think Vicki sees Vicki as that fearless big strong girl, but now... it&#39;s hard for her to see her current self as that big Vicki right... Victoria?&quot; Victoria let out a small grunt in confirmation. <br />
Nessa said &quot;I can&#39;t believe this, I&#39;m dragging Ronda right here and putting you back in your right mind!&quot; She knew that Ronda was probably at one of Saya&#39;s parties and knew where they would be having it. She started running ignoring the fact that she was in fact 3/4ths of her usual age and much weaker. <br />
John wondered &quot;Wait where are you going?!?&quot; <br />
Victoria opened the door and said &quot;Saya has parties and Ronda always joins in... real easy to sneak in and... Vicki would sometimes sneak in to steal booze.&quot; <br />
John aged herself up to her normal age and said &quot;We have to go after her, you know where she is. You need to come with me Navigator Victoria!&quot; and nabbed Victoria and carried her away. Going through the living room let out a &quot;Anyone in need of any age change say so now! Gotta go!&quot;<br />
Dolly went &quot;huh?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Wait, your foods getting cold!&quot;<br />
Cindy asked &quot;Where are you going this late at night?!?&quot; and John just let his magic rip as Dolly felt herself becoming an older woman, Cindy grew back into a teen, and Kathy shrank back down to a kid again.</p>
