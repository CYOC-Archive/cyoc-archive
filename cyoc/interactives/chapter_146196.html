<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joan woke, exhausted and hazy on the night before. Her last real memory was lying down to rest up while waiting for Henry to come back. Then there were just slips of vivid dreams, dreams of Satyrs and lust; of debauchery. Only. She was sure her husband and daughter had featured in them. She cracked open her eyes fully, heart leaping to her throat at the empty bed beside her. Henry hadn&#39;t made it home!<br />
Wait. There was a note on the bed.<br />
<br />
Panicked she grabbed it and quickly sighed in relief at the handwriting. It was Henry&#39;s, he was fine. Her adrenaline ebbed. She sniffed and turned it right side up, bringing it close to her face.<br />
<br />
In sniffing she took in a lungful of the stale smell of goat pee still permeating the room. Unable to locate the source of the smell at a glance she ignored it and decided to read the note first.<br />
<br />
&#39;Joan, my treasure,<br />
<br />
I&#39;m fine, I&#39;ve decided to sleep in the sitting room.<br />
Jess told me about what&#39;s going on. About the tails. About the animals.<br />
She seems to know what&#39;s going on here, she figured it out last night.<br />
Whenever you&#39;re up. Come join us in the kitchen. I think we need to talk about this. To let Jess explain what is happening to us.<br />
<br />
I love you.<br />
Henry.&#39;<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s heart was pounding. Henry knew about the tail. how did Jess know about it? Had she seen her? In the forest? Maybe last night did happen.<br />
<br />
Joan leapt from the to her feet. Hooves cased in boots hitting the ground hard. <br />
<br />
*Thump-Thump*<br />
<br />
If anyone was awake they definitely heard that. Bending over Joan grabbed the bottom of the dress and hefted it up, turning to check her tail.<br />
<br />
It looked like it always had.<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
What was that?<br />
<br />
She turned to check her front. There, snuggled between her thighs, dangled a pudgy, pale penis.<br />
<br />
If anyone wasn&#39;t woken by the thumping of her boots, the scream she let loose next would have woken the dead.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
It was the most uncomfortable family meeting they had ever had. Roused from sleep the Miller family had gathered in the kitchen at the behest of a mute Henry, holding a stack of papers with instructions on them.<br />
<br />
Initially cagey, and still incredibly perturbed about yesterday&#39;s events, Jess struggled to speak, until her father had urged her to on. First Explaining how she had found the diary. How she had read it, and what it entailed.<br />
<br />
An early-on question from a pale James revealed that the diary in question had been thrown into a fire and burned in a fit of anger, and that they would have to go with Jess&#39;s word on this. She was not proud of that, and James not happy they had to take her word for it<br />
<br />
With no better explanation, Joan was willing to believe this. Henry seemed convinced too. Only James paid mute sour ceremony to whole thing from then on.<br />
<br />
Jess then explained how the animal you would turn into was the first one you spoke after entering the Cabin, and how Henry had avoided that fate so far.<br />
<br />
Joan, then offered a squeeze of her husband&#39;s hand. Which he warmly returned. The squeeze and smile made Joan&#39;s new addition twitch, and she pulled away quickly.<br />
<br />
Jess volunteered then that she had mentioned a Bull, and that she remembered James mentioning a Horse. <br />
<br />
A round of speculation followed and came to the conclusion that the word &quot;Kids&quot; was probably what set Joan off. Henry looked pale as a ghost. It was lucky he tended to call the children by their full names, or by exactly that &quot;children&quot;.<br />
<br />
The proverbial elephant in the room quickly became apparent that Joan, visibly only had her tail changed. Meaning to the other family members that the initial change was all that had been triggered with her. Jess lamented this, explaining that she&#39;d had three run-ins. One initial one, one while confirming what the journal said. Joan questioned the final one, but Jess shook her head and initially refused to speak. Looking up she saw James, he looked like he was in the midst of passing a kidney stone.<br />
<br />
She quickly added, &quot;I dunno, I just sort of masturbated the third time. I&#39;m not proud of it.&quot;. Lying was hard, but better than admitting her third orgasm was because her brother was eating out her ass.<br />
<br />
A redirect at James with his visible ears as a change, and he just grunted. &quot;I wanked Mom. Can we please not talk about the specifics.&quot; He looked like he was going to be ill.<br />
<br />
A round of silence followed, until Joan, as nonchalantly as possible asked. &quot;Does it matter that you said Bull, instead of Cow, Jess?&quot; to her daughter.<br />
<br />
 Shifting in her seat and making eye contact with no-one, Jess mumbled an answer, that it didn&#39;t matter. The animals they were turning into would be hermaphrodites.<br />
<br />
Joan sank into her seat, shocked and would have given the game away, had James not exploded in fury at that very moment, jumping to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is totally fucking out of order! There&#39;s no such thing as &#39;magic&#39; turning people into animals. Into women. I&#39;m no woman.&quot; His eyes wide, puffing he scanned the room. Making contact with his sister&#39;s eyes, she glowered back at him. &quot;Oh yeah, what&#39;s this then?&quot; She reached up and flicked his ear. Both instantly pinned themselves back against his head and he flinched back.<br />
<br />
Joan at that very moment, to the view of no one was hyperventilating. She had this penis forever, and forever would eventually become life as a hermaphroditic goat. How could she possibly explain to her husband that she had changed too more times than she actually had.<br />
<br />
James, taking only a moment to recover from the ear-flick, wheeled and roared. &quot;FUCK YOU! YOU FUCKING COW! YOU PROBABLY LOVE EVERY SECOND OF THIS&quot;, at his sister, jabbing his finger into her voluminous chest. Henry slammed his fist on the table, but James ignored him and continued shouting, at a shocked looking Jess, &quot;YOU LOVE WANKING AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY YOU MASSIVE SLUT! I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU MANKY BOX OF DILDOS AT HOME!&quot;. Jess&#39;s lip began to tremble, eyes watering.<br />
<br />
&quot;JAMES THAT&#39;S ENOUGH!!!&quot; Both fists now hammered onto the table. The sound of hearing their father speak for the first time that morning stopped all three members in their tracks. James, puffing, with a look of blue murder in his eyes. Jess, shocked at distraught, tears now streaming down. Joan, anxious and horrified.<br />
<br />
James looked like he was going to say something, then thought better of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m outta here...&quot; he mumbled, storming off out the back door. Even as he did, Jess found her voice. &quot;It&#39;ll do no good James.&quot; He didn&#39;t pause, so she called out, &quot;Be careful...&quot;. Despite what he had said, outing her most shameful secret, Jess knew that what had happened between them the night before had hit him hard. He was in it deep with Melissa, and this must all really have shook him to the core. It was unsurprising he was lashing out.<br />
<br />
Henry, knowing none of this, just saw how worried Jess seemed for her brother even in the face of such vile verbal abuse. His heart broke for her.<br />
<br />
Joan was the next to move, throat raspy as she croaked. &quot;Honey, can we... Talk in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry nodded, gathering up paper and pens and followed his wife. He paused for a moment as he passed his dejected daughter. He paused for a moment. Placing both of his hands on her shoulders he kissed the top of her crown and after a moment&#39;s pause added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a good person Jessica Miller.&quot; He patted her shoulder reassuringly and followed his wife from the room.<br />
<br />
Thinking back to seducing and sucking off her brother, along with fantasising about her father sure didn&#39;t make Jess feel like a good person.</p>
