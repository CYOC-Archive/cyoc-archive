<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two boys turned mature adult women stood on the sidewalk, inspecting their new forms and struggling with their new minds, both oblivious to the subtle changes that happened to the world around them. And both of them oblivious to the ogling, hidden eyes of Rob Bolstrum.<br />
<br />
In the original reality, Rob was already long since in Bill Strasserman&#39;s basement, lurking in the darkness on orders from &#39;Big Jon&#39; Ingerman and trying to hatch a plan of his own to turn the tables on the cruel rich kid that had taken what little Rob had had in that stupid fight. But now that Bill and Tom no longer existed, Rob was making his way towards Shermer High for another day where he was more or less king of the school. Or maybe more like a duke or baron, considering his arrangement with Jonathan Ingerman in this reality. Without Bill or Tom to play hero and weaken Rob&#39;s powerbase, Big Jon had simply proposed a mutually beneficial business arrangement, the rich kid playing it safe and not willing to take Rob on while he still had the full fear and respect of Shermer High&#39;s bullies.<br />
<br />
So now Rob and &#39;Bolstrum&#39;s Bullies&#39; simply acted as enforcers for Big Jon, forcing the stupid population of the high school (and some of the more spineless faculty and staff) into doing what Ingerman wanted. And that meant that Rob got to do whatever it was HE wanted, so long as he played it smart and didn&#39;t let things blow back onto Big Jon. Meanwhile Ingerman himself had joined Shermer High&#39;s football and basketball teams, quickly becoming a star and was currently nailing the queen of the school, Gloria Vanapolous. And in this reality, Gloria had lacked a Tom to bully emotionally in order to prop herself up and give her experience at manipulating men, now she was just another bitchy cheerleader who fawned over a hot guy that could fuck her brains out (and buy her anything she wanted in return).<br />
<br />
So the minor change of just two teenage boys transforming themselves into attractive older women had given Rob his best life. He was paid well by Ingerman, enough that he was finally out of Shermer&#39;s skid row, the Shermer Fields trailercourt and was living in his own apartment on the main street of Old Shermer! He had even scored a semi-decent truck to cruise around in for practically nothing, another &#39;gift&#39; of Big Jon to his prized enforcer. After all, what good was having his own private army is said private army was stuck hoofing it everywhere? There was also the smartphone, but Rob had never been one for the Internet life, using it most for the GPS, weather, and occasionally watching Youtube. There were far more interesting things for the brute to focus on in his life, and the Internet was simply not one of them. Drinking as early (or as late) as he wanted though, that was certainly interesting and the world was already spinning slightly from the beers Rob had drank for breakfast a few minutes earlier before he&#39;d piled into his truck and taken off for the school.<br />
<br />
And it was from said truck, as he had cruised down the road on his way to the high school, that Rob had spied the two hot chicks doing...something on the sidewalk that seemed extremely hot. He&#39;d zipped around the corner and had parked the truck somewhat haphazardly on the curb, leaping out to his current vantage point where he could observe the women that had once been his enemies from a distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah blondie, pull that brown haired bitch in&quot; Rob whispered to himself as he felt his cock begin to stiffen in his underwear. To Rob, he had no idea who these women were, but they were hot. And in his mind, hot chicks were always A: Dumb as rocks and B: Secretly attracted to each other. Or C: Cunt.<br />
<br />
And honestly, it wasn&#39;t as if girls had been lining up to date him, even in the small &#39;slut court&#39; that hung around his gang. Even as &#39;baron of the bullies&#39; Rob had found it difficult to land a girl for anything more than a cheap fuck or a blow job. The position he was in, the power, came with a &#39;fear&#39; tax and outside of just momentary pleasure, girls were just too scared of him. Really the only girl that had ever given him more than the time of day had been his old trailer court neighbor Amber Reid, and she&#39;d moved away the first chance she&#39;d gotten and was clearly NOT looking back. So Rob simply had to take his thrills where he could get them. And besides, without a ball and chain he was open to play the field however he liked.<br />
<br />
And right now, that meant scoping out the two hot chicks, even if they weren&#39;t going to simple start ripping each other&#39;s clothes off and fuck right there on the sidewalk like Rob&#39;s mind was picturing, even as the blonde and the brunette parted from their emotional hug and...shook hands?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh c&#39;mon, kiss or somethin&#39;!&quot; Rob groaned loudly at the strangely masculine gesture between the two chicks. Rob didn&#39;t expect the blonde, who he expected to be nothing more than a brain-dead bimbo, little more than just walking tits and ass, to suddenly make eye contact with him down the street. He could see her brown eyes open wide and those plump, dick sucking lips form a perfect &#39;O&#39; before she whispered something to her brunette companion, who turned around, her big breasts jiggling within the yellow fabric of the blouse. Something flashed a bright green withing the brunette&#39;s fingers as her surprised face furrowed into a scowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no sense hiding anymore&quot; Rob chuckled to himself as he straightened up out of the crouch he had been in and sauntered around the corner, making sure to put his full muscled might on display in the morning light. Had he not been been inebriated, both with beer and overconfidence, Rob may have realized that this was a bad idea, that he should get back in his truck and continue on his way. But instead he simply sauntered on, only stumbling once as he made his way down the sidewalk. He saw the blonde&#39;s eyes go even wider as she bit her lower lip, her eyes seemingly locked on Rob&#39;s pecs as they pressed against the fabric of his red shirt. Rob gave her what he felt was a winning smile despite his chipped and somewhat misaligned teeth (brought on by his own rough and tumble lifestyle and the many fights that it involved). Already his mind was ablaze with pick up lines and visions of himself and the two lovely ladies in front of him sprawled out in some bed naked as could be. Hell, just nailing one would make him even more of a legend within his gang, let alone the rest of the impressionable school populace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello ladies&quot; The redheaded giant said as charmingly as he could as he approached Bill and Tom, or rather, Willow and Tammy. He made no effort to hide his wandering eyes as he scanned their attractive bodies, &quot;Did I just get ina wreck? Cuz I&#39;m seeing a couple of angels right now&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fucking hell&quot; The blonde said, bringing up a tiny palm to cover her face, &quot;You have got to be kidding me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not kidding anyone, gorgeous. How &#39;bout I escort you and your friend here back to my truck?&quot; Rob pointed a slab-like finger up to the darkening sky as a early spring thunderstorm rolled in from the west, &quot;Hate for you ladies to get...heh, wet&quot; Rob said, giving Tom a lewd smile that sent a wave of disgust and anger rolling over him.<br />
<br />
But at the same time...<br />
<br />
Tammy...TOM couldn&#39;t deny that a part of him was really interested in touching Rob&#39;s bulging muscles. The moment that Willo-Bill had pointed Rob out, his/her first instinct had been anger, but then watching how their former enemy carried himself, the swagger of confidence...Rob wasn&#39;t the cowed dog he&#39;d been yesterday and a reality ago when he and Big Jon had waylaid Tom near McFly&#39;s. No, this was a Rob that was reminiscient of how the bully had been before Big Jon had arrived. And that, for some strange reason, was turning To-Tammy on. She felt something begin to get warm between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Tammy&quot; Willow hissed loudly, purposefully avoiding Rob as she turned to face down the street, &quot;Last thing we need is for the trailer trash idiot to get involved!&quot;. But the moment that Bill had finished speaking, he realized the error in what he&#39;d said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; She whispered. She&#39;d definitely not meant to just openly insult her former bully like that. It must have been the magic messing with her!<br />
<br />
Rob&#39;s confident grin faltered. &quot;Hey Barbie, y&#39;don&#39;t know a goddamn thing about me!&quot; Rob reached out with a meaty hand and spun the blonde around, her eyes wide in surprise, &quot;Got a lot of fucking nerve calling me stupid you braindead bimbo! You don&#39;t get to fucking judge me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow! ROB STOP!&quot; Willow cried out as the Bully squeezed her shoulder and pushed a large finger into her pretty face. He was close enough now that Willow could smell the smoke and booze on Rob&#39;s breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;LL STOP WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT! You think just b&#39;cuz you&#39;ve got money, just cause yer hot, you think you can give me orders!? I&#39;m king around here! YOU serve ME!&quot; Rob tensed him muscles and pushed down on the blonde&#39;s shoulder, cause her shapely legs to buckle as he pushed her down to her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Right where you belong! Right where you both belong! BENEATH ME!&quot; Rob snorted as he reached out with a massive hand towards Tammy, alcohol, horniness and ego clouding out what good judgement the juggernaut possessed.<br />
<br />
And just like that, the whatever arousal that had been building within Tammy&#39;s nether regions vanished completely as she watched her best friend get assaulted by their former bully. Tammy gripped the magical gemstone that had gotten them into this mess tightly as it began to glow.<br />
<br />
Tammy knew what she had to do as she darted backwards, expertly manuevering on her heels as she evaded Rob&#39;s grip.</p>
