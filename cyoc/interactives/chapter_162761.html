<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill was sick of how full his breasts were.  He changed “work” to “home”.  Immediately, they were in front of Bill’s house.<br />
<br />
“All right, I’ll cover for you again and say you didn’t leave the shift early,” Roger said.  He removed his pants.  “But you need to do me a favor, first.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Bill sighed.  He took off his pants as well.<br />
<br />
“Nuh-uh.  Top, too.  I wanna see those bazongas of yours,” Roger said.  Scowling, Bill removed his shirt and nursing bra.  Roger grinned.  “That’s more like it.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s get it over with,” Bill said, laying on his back.  Roger climbed on top of him.<br />
<br />
“You know you love it,” Roger purred in his ear.  He shoved his member deep into Bill, making his fuckbuddy gasp.  “That’s it, baby.”<br />
<br />
Despite his sore breasts and general exhaustion from parenting a young baby, Bill found himself enjoying the sex session with Roger, like usual.  He moaned as Roger thrusted into him roughly, pounding him with force.  Bill didn’t like being treated gently, so he loved Roger’s complete lack of tenderness.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me harder,” he groaned.  “Make me sore!”  Roger obliged, hammering him over and over again.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna do more than make you sore, baby.  We’re gonna make Riley a little brother.”<br />
<br />
“What?”  Bill was brought out of his ecstasy.  “But-”<br />
<br />
“You know the deal,” Roger said, continuing to pound Bill.  “When you give me a son, then I’ll leave my bitchy wife.  But I’m not doing it until we have a Roger Jr.”  Before Bill could protest, Roger came, shooting Bill full of a thick load of semen.<br />
<br />
“All right,” Bill said, panting.  “I’ll go inside-”<br />
<br />
“Not until you’re good and pregnant with a boy, Bill.”  Roger thrust into Bill again.  They fucked twice more until Roger was satisfied.  “Okay, now you can go take care of Riley.”  Bill went into his house, dismissed the babysitter, and went into his daughter’s nursery.<br />
<br />
“Come here, Riley,” he said, picking her up.  He sat down and removed his blouse and bra.  Riley immediately latched onto his breast hungrily.  As Bill waited for Riley to finish feeding, he pulled out his phone and generated a new sentence.  He didn’t remember the deal with Roger, that they could be a couple if he gave birth to a son.  In fact, he couldn’t remember how he had started out.  He knew he’d changed things, but he didn’t know what they were.<br />
<br />
Well, he couldn’t return things to original if he didn’t know what the original was.  He might as well make things easier on him.  And things would be easier if Roger was willing to do more than just pay child support.  Bill looked down at the sentence he had generated.<br />
<br />
“Bill is newly pregnant with Roger’s daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Dammit!” Bill swore.  He’d gotten pregnant, but not with a boy.  He quickly changed “daughter” to “boy”.  There wasn’t an immediate change.  Bill scowled.  There wasn’t a change because there was no way to tell he was pregnant with a boy.<br />
<br />
Bill generated a few more sentences before he could increase how pregnant he was.  Finally, he successfully changed himself from being barely pregnant to heavily pregnant.  Riley, still breastfeeding, grew in size, as did his belly.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Bill was confused.  Then he realized that if he was almost full-term, Riley had to be more than a month old.  After all, he did give birth to her.  He burped Riley.  Her spit-up got everywhere.<br />
<br />
Roger walked into the nursery.  He leaned over and kissed the top of Bill’s head.<br />
<br />
“Hey, baby.  Why don’t you go clean up?  I’ll take care of Riley.”<br />
<br />
“Gladly,” Bill mumbled.  He got up and waddled out of the nursery, leaving his phone behind.  Roger put Riley into her crib and picked up the phone.  He remembered how he had made his coworker his fuckbuddy and baby maker, resulting in him finally having a son and a reason to leave his wife.  Roger wanted to see what all he could do to make things even better.  He generated a new sentence.<br />
<br />
“Roger will soon have two children.”  Roger grinned.  He changed “two” to “four” and generated a new sentence.  “Bill is pregnant with triplet boys.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Roger mumbled.  He frowned thoughtfully.  The best thing to do would be to make Bill a stay-at-home dad.  That way, he could take care of all four kids.  But they needed money.  After a few edits, they were now rich and living in a mansion, Roger was the police chief, and Bill was a stay-at-home parent.  But not married to Roger.  Roger was fine living with and being in a public relationship with his fuckbuddy.  But he didn’t want to be tied down.<br />
<br />
After a moment, he made his relationship with Bill an open one.  But only for him.  He wanted all of Bill’s kids to be his, but he wanted to get some on the side without Bill nagging at him.<br />
<br />
Before Roger could make any more edits, Bill returned.  Bill was enormous, as he was almost full term with triplets.  His breasts, big before, were huge now.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my phone!” Bill said.  He took it from Roger.  “The chef wants to know what you want for dinner.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll go tell him,” Roger said, upset to have lost the phone but pleased with what he changed.  He left the room.  Bill looked down at the phone, panicking over what edits Roger may have made.  He didn’t think Roger changed anything.  He remembered very well that Roger had gotten promoted and inherited a lot of money after a relative died, as well as the discovery that he was pregnant with identical triplet boys.<br />
<br />
Even though he was sure Roger didn’t change anything, Bill wanted to change something himself.  With some difficulty, he sat down in the rocking chair and generated a new sentence.<br />
<br />
It read “Bill is unhappy to be a stay-at-home father, but does it to satisfy his fuckbuddy, Roger.”</p>
