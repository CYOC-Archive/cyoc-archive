<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was slow walk back to your car and a quick drive back to your house.  Lydia had called her parents to let them know where she was going.  Now you were seated in the warmly finished basement of your house with the lamp sitting on the coffee table between you.  The lid was still separate and the lamp still tarnished with age.  The rest of the house was empty and it would remain so for the weekend.<br />
<br />
Lydia had taken off her sweater as soon as she had stepped through the door.  Her spandex skin was vibrant in the diffuse lighting.  The wide, white streak down her front was bounded by the shimmery red of her sides.  The spandex had changed everything up to her chin and down to her ankles.  Her jeans provided a barrier that kept her legs from merging but she was almost incapable of spreading them apart.  Her hair was white and she brushed it with red fingers letting one hand stray down to her hefty bosom to idly touch them.<br />
<br />
You had not really spoken about the genie since you made your purchase.  You had been too deep in thought and too timid to tell her just what you wanted.  She looked beautiful to you right now.  You swore that her face had changed just a little along with everything else.  Her eyes were smokier, her lips just a little fuller and they glistened when she spoke.  Her breasts needed little description.  Lydia was something special, something unique and she loved it.  You loved it.  You loved her.  Today had not been so bad, had it?  You could manage this right?<br />
<br />
Lydia sat on the carpet with her stiff legs stretching out under the table.  She had not wanted to tell her boyfriend how much they ached to be together.  She did not tell herself how much she wanted them merge and become the long, muscly tail it could be.  Lydia tossed her hair and tried to keep her hands from constantly running up and down her curvy body.  The red/white divides had been tingling all afternoon.  The fleecy hoodie had been slipping over her large breasts teasing her endlessly.  She felt wonderfully on the verge of losing control of herself.  She just wanted to tear off her pants and roll about on the soft carpet.  She just was not sure if this was the sort of thing she wanted for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you thirsty?&quot; you say finally.<br />
<br />
Lydia shakes her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to use it?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Lydia shrugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might not work,&quot; you try to say without emotion.  It would really suck if the magic could not be changed and you were stuck like a sexy mermaid for life, you think.  Lydia had already forgiven you for your mistake.  If it did not work you would be able to have your silly cake and be blameless.  &quot;Maybe all wishes are permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
She bites her large lip in a cute way.  &quot;But it was not even supposed to be permanent in the first place.  A temporary change, right.  One time only, I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I don't really know how it was supposed to work.  You certainly were not supposed to be coated in spandex.  Not that I mind.&quot;  You blush.  The digital camera waited in your room.<br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;I just don't want to have to always be in fear of being wet.  I want to have some control over it or give it up entirely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you said you were wet this morning in the shower.  Remember?  It was only when you were wearing a swim suit that it started again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah.  Maybe it only happens when I'm wearing a suit.  It's not like I am going to spend my whole life wearing a swim suit under my clothes.  That could work.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a momentary pause.  &quot;Did we just decide that you we're not going to try and fix you?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
She bites her lip again.  &quot;Maybe.  Do you think we should?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made a bad decision already without thinking.  We could be completely wrong about everything.  I would really like to get some answers out of this,&quot; you gesture at the lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know, even if we can't fix me, I really enjoy my changes.  Even if you think this is a mistake.  I like it.  I am willing to life with it if we can't fix it.  But if we can I would like some more control.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile at her relieved.  You wanted to say the exact same thing but were too afraid to let her know.  She did not need you telling her what to do.<br />
<br />
You lift the tiny lid into place and feel a magical field pulling on it; like strong magnets.  It slips out of your fingers and lands with a metal note like a bell.  Instantly, the tarnish of the ages vanishes from the surface of the lamp.  It once again becomes shiny and bright.  It seems whole once again and almost alive.  Like and activated bomb it was a simple object with powerful potential.  You can read the lettering clearly now and are certain this is the lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess the dealer kept the lid off so no one could accidentally use it,&quot; Lydia said.  &quot;I must really be dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really want to continue?  Should I rub it or should you?  We can wait a little while if you want?&quot; you ask.  Now that you were comfortable where you were the pressure was off.<br />
<br />
She looks at you and for once you can not tell what she is thinking.  You wait for her decision.</p>
