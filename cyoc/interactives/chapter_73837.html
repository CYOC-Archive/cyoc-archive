<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two skaters finally decided to leave the shop; before they managed to walk through the front door, they were stopped by the handsome clerk, handing them what looked like a couple of golden business cards. Jake was surprised to see his name and surname printed on it, even if he had never told them to the clerk. &quot;This is a very special feature for our loyal customers only&quot;, he said, nodding. On the card, apart from the name, five squares were printed: on Jake's card, the first one had been filled by an elegant, complicated signature. &quot;Bring five friends to the shop and you'll get another free item! How about that?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;This kills two birds with a stone, man&quot;, Derek said to Jake while they were walking down the road. He looked more excited than ever. &quot;Now we can find some recruits for our crew, and at the same time we'll get the opportunity to change ourselves again!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake wasn't as eager as his lover to transform in someone (or something) else again, especially because he liked being an imposing, handsome skater jock, but just nodded in response. &quot;Can't wait to have some cute little twinks around, worshiping our feet&quot;. He took Derek by his hand, giving absolutely zero fucks to the surprised, shocked and (in more than one case) clearly aroused looks the two of them were collecting. The skate punk was his bro, his best friend and his lover, and he wanted the whole world to know that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Look at those fucking queers! Go away, we want no faggots around here!&quot;. Jake looked around to try and find the source of the disdainful cry, and saw three high-school jocks - probably in their senior year - rapidly approaching. They were bigger than the skaters - probably part of the football team or something - and their mean, tough faces were deformed in disgust. <br />
<br />
Derek sighed. &quot;Can we change them?&quot;. His friend nodded. &quot;It's not like someone will miss homophobic assholes like them, after all...&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the trio of jocks had cornered the two skaters, and just stared at them with their meaty arms crossed on their chests. &quot;Are you freaking deaf, homo? You and your friend fucked each other's ears and now they're so full of disgusting gay spooge that you don't hear anything?&quot;, the one in the middle - clearly the alpha male - asked. The other two jocks started laughing, like the leader of their pack had just told the funniest joke ever.<br />
<br />
Jake grinned. &quot;I heard you just fine&quot;, he replied. &quot;But considering you meatheads don't understand anything except for violence, why don't we solve the problem with our fists?&quot;.<br />
<br />
The laughter from the jocks became roaring. &quot;You can't be serious&quot;, the alpha male replied. &quot;No queer can ever hope to even touch me&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't be so sure about that, pal&quot;. Taking his time, Jake took the Etnies off and stuffed them between one of the smaller jocks' hands. &quot;Can you please hold onto them for a while? They're very important to me, I don't want them to get stained by your friend's blood&quot;.<br />
<br />
The football player was clearly disgusted by the Etnies. &quot;No way in hell I'm looking after your shitty old shoes, faggot! Just...&quot;. And then he stopped, his face becoming dopey and ecstatic: the smell coming from the magic sneakers was starting to take effect. While muttering something unintelligible, the high-school jock buried his nose in one of the Etnies and sniffed for some long seconds.<br />
<br />
The other flunky stared at him dumb-founded. &quot;The fuck are you doing, Chris? Are you a queer, too?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chris' only answer was to hold the shoes in front of his friend's face. &quot;I can't help it, Rick...&quot;, he replied in a slurry voice. &quot;This is so fucking good...&quot;. And after a couple of seconds, the stoned expressions on the jocks' faces matched.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck's happening to you two?!&quot;, the leader exclaimed, frustrated and even a little scared. &quot;Drop those fucking shoes and stop acting like retards!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Derek, fast as a fox, took one of the Etnies from Chris' hands and pressed it tightly against the face of the alpha male. &quot;Why don't you try it, too? Maybe you'll like it...&quot;, he said with a sly grin. The bigger jock didn't put out that much of a fight: less than five seconds later, he had been reduced to a drooling, submissive zombie like his two friends. <br />
<br />
Jake and Derek somehow managed to push the three of them in the nearest alley, before their transformation in horny, twinky skaters could be too noticeable: the jocks had already lost a couple of inches and looked a whole year younger, but were still bulky and mean-looking... That was going to change soon, obviously. <br />
<br />
Once the five boys were in the deserted alley, Jake literally ripped off the alpha male's shirt, exposing his beefy chest. &quot;You said I couldn't even hope to touch you?&quot;, he mocked the changing jock, his body starting to lose mass in exchange for tone and definition. &quot;Let's see what happens if I try this...&quot;, and he fished the nipple piercing from his pocket. Derek hugged his lover from behind and kissed his cheek. &quot;I see what you're doing... And I love it&quot;, he said in a sultry voice. Jake nodded, and pressed the metal bar against the jock's left nipple. <br />
<br />
The moaning that escaped from the former football player's lips - now perfect for kissing and cocksucking - was vulnerable and pure like that of a lamb: he now looked like a fourteen years old, slim and twinky but with enough muscle definition to put the majority of underwear models to shame. Dozens of tattoos started violating the symmetry of his body, covering him with tribal patterns and constellations of tiny black stars; a small writing circling his unpierced nipple proclaimed he was &quot;PROUD2SERVE&quot;. Jake made him turn around, just in time to see his bubble butt toning up, while the word BITCH appeared written in big, squared letters just above his crack. The faggy twink was lost in a horny daze, barely registering his face and cock twitching and tingling: he now sported a lip piercing, multiple rings from both ears, an acid green stud in his tongue and a thick septum ring. Jake gently peeled off the now baggy pants of the young skate punk, revealing a cock so heavily studded and pierced it would have been impossible for him to stuck it anywhere or have someone suck it: the alpha male was now 100% bottom, a cute bitch for Jake and Derek to use in order to satisfy their every whim. The last and most important change happened to his feet, that were becoming slender, cute and obviously contagious size 10. The remnants of his t-shirt had already morphed into a net shirt, and the skate punk readily put it on, his nipple piercing and tats still clearly visible. &quot;I love you so much, Master Jake...&quot;, he panted, before placing a shy kiss on the skater's lips. &quot;I was in the closet before, and all that piled up aggression was killing me. But now I don't have to worry about what people think anymore!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake gently ruffled the now black and spiky hair of the jock-turned-twink. &quot;I love you too, Josh&quot;. The bond between the crew was now strong enough that they instinctively knew each other's name. <br />
<br />
The young skater smiled shyly. &quot;I can't wait to feel your big shaft up in my ass for the first time...&quot;, he murmured, before stroking himself against his Master's body, purring like a cat. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, Rick and Chris had completed their own changes, and now looked like 15 years old skaters, cute and horny. &quot;Dude!&quot;, they exclaimed, looking at each other, their eyes betraying their obvious lust, their size .9 feet now bare and wriggling with excitation. After a few seconds they couldn't help themselves anymore, and started making out, while Derek looked at them with a proud look on his face. After the kissing and groping session, both twinks looked at their friend Josh with envy. &quot;Why haven't I got some tats, too?&quot;, Chris complained, while Rick was clearly eyeing the thick rings dangling from Joss' face. <br />
<br />
Derek smiled. &quot;Don't worry, my little slaves, you can get your dose of ink and steel easily enough...&quot;. He exchanged a knowing glance with Jake. &quot;...and we can get closer to new free gifts&quot;.</p>
