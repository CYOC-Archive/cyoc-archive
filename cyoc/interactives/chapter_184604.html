<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fine, you want a lesson in biology?&quot; Her mother punched away at the phone. &quot;Here&#39;s a lesson on womanhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna staggered as an immense weight settled on her pelvis. She looked down but her vision was obscured by breasts even larger than before. Two soft udders that could now double as pillows. Her pink shirt was entirely inadequate, merely keeping the heaving mounds under tenuous control. The shirt showed an obscene volume of underboob and was moments away from becoming indecent. A moot point considering how her engorged nipples push against the thin cotton. She reaches under her heavy boobs, but her hands abruptly met the taught dome that should have been her flat belly. It curved away beyond her reach. This could only mean one thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m pregnant,&quot; Joanna stated. The truth was obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, I key part of what is expected of a woman,&quot; her mother said. &quot;You know what they say, a woman should be barefoot and pregnant. And my goodness, you&#39;re on your way there. Most woman are baby makers, but you&#39;re a full blown baby factory!&quot; Her mother tried to keep the laughter out of her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do!?&quot; Joanna asked in shock and anger.<br />
<br />
She struggled to twist and turn in an attempt to feel her dimension, but Joanna had lost so much of her range of motion. Her torso seemed locked in place; spine arched and pelvis tilted back. God, she had the posture of some bitch in heat. Joanna had to know what her mother had done to her body. She had to see more. The girl goes to turn and almost loses he balance. There&#39;s just so much weight divided between only two limbs. But something else is off, she&#39;s not standing right. She was standing with her feet firmly planted wider than her shoulders in some absurd power stance. But her legs didn&#39;t feel as if they were spread wide. She was definitely standing up straight. She peered over her shoulder and gasped at what she saw. Obscene flanks of flesh that jutted out a good two feet to either side of her. Her pelvis had widened to rival that of a cow&#39;s. A pair of hyper-fertile, broodmare&#39;s hips impractical for anything but passing more offspring. She pawed at her sides, feeling the soft doughy flesh.<br />
<br />
The jigsaw of hills that was her body was coming together, but she had too see more. Joanna shuffled around until she was pointed at the car-turned minivan. she needed a reflection. She trundled up to it&#39;s side and saw her murky silhouette, which was enough with her absurd proportions. She whimpered at what she saw in the vague shadows. Fat, meaty, girthy thighs who&#39;s soft flesh that threatened to bulge over her kneecaps. Her legs flared out again to calves swollen with muscle. Between the tree trunk legs and the hippo hips, her butt no longer seemed so disproportionate. That&#39;s one way to lose a bubble butt. And there in her center, the source of it all. The monstrously huge orb of flesh that was her pregnant belly. This wasn&#39;t a normal pregnancy, it was much too large. She looked long overdue with what must be octuplets at least. A sphere of taught skin who&#39;s popped belly button stuck out over four feet in front of her and curved down just past her knees. With legs fatter than a cow&#39;s and a belly the size of a person her bottoms were struggling to hold on. The pink sweatpants were skin tight and hanging dangerously low.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m so big,&quot; Joanna cried out. &quot;Why am I not at the hospital, I&#39;m ready to pop!&quot; Joanna gently rubbed her distended belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense sweetie, you&#39;re only in the second trimester,&quot; her mother consoled her. Joanna&#39;s mind raced as she tried to make sense of reality. &quot;I just new you&#39;d be a broodmother. You were just such an early bloomer. And, my goodness, did you take to those fertility treatments!&quot; Her mother punctuated the statement with a firm pat on the bum. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to make so many happy families.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna&#39;s head was spinning from the massive reality shift. Her mother had inexplicably warped all of human existence. Female fertility had been concentrated down to a fraction of the population. So those few woman were employed to bear everyone else&#39;s children and Joanna was one of those lucky few. They say woman like her have a choice, but that wasn&#39;t really true. Ever since her first period she was raised for breeding. Special diets, special gym class and special classes. By the time she was eighteen she had breasts a pornstar would envy and a bod so thicc she couldn&#39;t walk straight. And then there was the money. People made good money to put a ready-made bun in her oven and the tax breaks were not insignificant. So Joanna found herself hauling around her first baby in her final year of highschool. And then she was graduating with another five. It was a trap though. Enhancements made things a breeze but they were expensive. More babies needed more enhancements, which called for more babies. So here she was, with over dozen fetuses inside her and broodmother looking like a permanent career choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh,&quot; Joanna moaned, feeling like a fat piece of livestock. &quot;I&#39;m so heavy... so full.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s what you get for being so greedy,&quot; her mother chastised. &quot;Now let&#39;s go spend some of that maternity money. We&#39;ll get you a nice milker and you&#39;ll feel much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the fat heifer waddled after her mother into the mall.</p>
