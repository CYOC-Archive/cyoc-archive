<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If anyone could have seen the interior of Alex’s house that night, they would be shocked. Despite it now being after dark, not a single light was on in the place, save for a single room being lit up by a bright, eerie green glow. Hannah sat on the bed, her eyes closed and a wicked smile on her face. She abruptly let out a loud burst of laughter at something only she could see. “Oh, that’s too funny.” She said with a burst of loud, cackling laughter. Next to her the idol’s eyes were glowing a bright green, lighting up the entire room as its power intensified. <br />
<br />
Alex hesitated, trying to think of a place where he knew the family wouldn’t be home. He didn’t know anyone in Blanton, but there had to be at least someone on vacation, right? Ethan, noticing his hesitation, offered. “Or I could take you back to my place. It’s a lot closer, and it is getting late.” Alex knew exactly what he meant and panicked. “But what about your dad?” He asked, realizing too late that the girl he was supposed to be wouldn’t have any knowledge about that. Ethan gave him  a surprised look. “He’s out of town for the next two days, we’ll have the place to ourselves. Why?” He asked. “Just trying to make sure we aren’t bothering anyone.” Alex stammered. <br />
<br />
Ethan nodded and put the car in drive. “Well, don’t worry, we’re fine.” He replied, reaching over and pulling Alex into a side hug. As he did Alex got a brief glimpse into the rear view mirror….. and stared in disbelief, his brain struggling to catch up. <br />
<br />
A pretty, petite blonde girl was sitting next to Ethan. She was wearing the same outfit he’d been, but nobody was going to be mistaking this girl for a boy, especially with how large her breasts were. The weight on them on his chest caused Alex to gasp. Too late, he realized his hand had drifted down, almost on its own, and was resting on Ethan’s crotch. And he had definitely gotten the wrong idea.<br />
<br />
“You think that’s impressive” Ethan said, briefly glancing over to catch Alex staring at his crotch. “You should wait till later.” Alex’s panic intensified. At the rate things were going he was going to be spending the night in Ethan’s bed, and he didn’t think either of them were going to be doing much sleeping. As they rolled through the town’s sleepy streets, Alex stroked Ethan’s rock hard member. A handjob! You are giving him a handjob! A little voice in his head screamed. He didn’t know how he looked like this, or why he suddenly seemed to be entirely female, or why everything seemed so normal, but he had to play it cool. “You’re so biiiiig.” Alex said, another giggle filling the interior of the car. Where had that come from? <br />
<br />
Glancing up, Alex was shocked to find they’d somehow covered the distance between the bar and Ethan’s house in little time. Ethan lived in a nice sized four bedroom house, but it was just him and his dad. His older sister was in the military, stationed overseas, and his mom hadn’t been around for a while. He’d been in this house so many times before, and it was beyond bizarre seeing it like this. <br />
<br />
He brushed a strand of blonde hair out of his eyes. “I don’t know if we should do this Ethan.” Alex meekly squeaked, as Ethan unlocked the door. He wasn’t even really sure what he meant by “this”, but as he followed Ethan inside he knew things were careening out of control. Ethan led him up to his bedroom, sports photos and trophies proudly lining the walls.<br />
<br />
“Want a beer?” Ethan asked, opening the mini fridge Alex had helped him lug up those stairs last year and pulling one out. Alex nodded, and with a call of “cheers” both of them took a long pull on their drinks. Alex’s eyes opened wide in surprise. What brand was this? It seemed way stronger than the beers he usually drank. Ethan took another pull on his beer and unbuttoned the top button of his dress shirt. “I’m just going to put on something a little more comfortable.” He told Alex. Alex bit his lip. He knew Ethan was in good shape, but wow—no! Bad brain! He scolded himself, and took another drink from his own beer. Hopefully Ethan hadn’t noticed. Ethan then took his cell out of his pocket and put it on his night stand. Alex glanced at it and quickly had an idea. <br />
<br />
“Like, I need to call my parents!” he said looking at the phone. “What?” Ethan asked, confused. Alex took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. “My Mom is like a total lunatic! She will call out the National Guard trying to find me if I don’t let her know I am staying out.” Alex quickly said, wondering why he was talking like this. All of a sudden it just seemed like the most natural thing in the world to say “like” a lot. Of course, the only one who could actually help was Aunt Hannah. Hopefully he remembered her number and she wasn’t asleep or something.<br />
<br />
“No problem.” Ethan said handing Alex the phone. To his relief the numbers for his aunt’s phone were easy to remember, almost as if he’d been dialing it forever. The phone rang a few times, and as he waited, Ethan got behind him on the bed and began to suck on his neck. <br />
<br />
Alex giggled. His head was swirling faster and faster. “Quit it, you are going to give me a hickey!”  He said. Why didn’t the phone pick up? It seemed like it had been ringing forever….</p>
