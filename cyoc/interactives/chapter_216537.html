<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony awoke to the sound of a fist knocking on the door of his room at the Costa Caballo training facility. Opening the door, he found it was an employee dining room staff member bringing him his first evening meal on a cart. Tony could smell it very well and felt his stomach growling, but he still didn&#39;t seem to have anything close to the superhuman senses he&#39;d one day be using to track down illegal drugs. He was also somewhat thankful it was human food at least. His diet would still be watched closely, but it would continue to be mostly human-oriented until he was no longer mostly human. He licked his lips and thanked the dining employee, then took the delightful wish with him into his bedroom.<br />
<br />
To anyone else, it would just be boring cafeteria food, but Tony had not eaten since breakfast and was starting to get his first inkling&#39;s of a dog&#39;s appetite. It took every bit of will power not to stick his whole face straight down into the curry noodles and stir-fried chicken chunks, but he forced himself to grab the fork and feed himself like a human while he still could. Every mouthful down his throat was an ecstasy. If he was going to enjoy eating even half this intensely after he became a full dog, then Tony thought it would be worth almost any downside he might have to put up with from his new life. He finished the serving completely and then started licking the plate clean. When it was over, he found himself even starting to daydream about himself vomiting it all up and wolfing it all down again, but he shook his head to get that fantasy thought out of his mind. He examined himself for any new changes that might have happened while he was asleep, but no, he was pretty much the same as far as he could tell. He fidgeted his clawed fingers, wiggled his newly empowered tailbone, looked himself over for any potential fur growth, twitched his ears a little, and ... wait, what?<br />
<br />
Tony got up from his bed and looked into the mirror over his dresser. His face looked the same, but maybe his ears were just a tiny bit swollen, and--yes, he could move them a little! It wasn&#39;t very much, not noticeably more than some humans can, but Tony was sure he had never been able to do so before. He thought about the tall German shepherd ears he&#39;d eventually be sporting and wondered what it would be like to hear the world through such massive mobile collectors! Oh, well, for now he&#39;d have to be satisfied with human ears with a little extra mobility until more of his changes started to kick in. It would be several days at least before his transformation would be completed. He wasn&#39;t sure whether that was a blessing or a curse, because on the one hand, he would like to get it over with so he could stop being in limbo about the whole thing, but on the other hand, it was kind of nice to be able to experience each difference and let himself become more and more acclimated to living as more of an animal. If even his nudity and his slight physical changes had somewhat freaked him out at first, Tony could really envision himself losing control if his entire human form was just suddenly and completely gone.<br />
<br />
Sniffing back over his dinner plate again and taking a few more licks off of it, he finally looked out the window and saw the sun going down and thought he might want to clean himself up before bed time. He reached for the door handle and stepped out into the hallway as naked as the day he was born (except for the collar and name tag, of course). He&#39;d read in the brochure by his bedside that there was a communal bathroom down the hall where early-stage transformees could continue their human hygiene routines until it became undesirable or impossible for them to do so. However, as soon as the door closed behind him, he was surprised by the sight of someone he probably should have expected to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi, Tony, how&#39;s your transformation going? Ooh, nice claws. I hope I&#39;ll be able to handle mine when they grow in.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Megan, the blonde girl Tony had met in the waiting room. She did not have claws, but she was no longer blonde, and she had an extra pair of nipples beneath the original pair on her breasts. Like Tony, she was nude except for a collar with her name on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey, Megan! Yeah, um, I&#39;m glad to see you made it through your intake meeting all right. Where are you staying? We&#39;ll have to meet up some evening and chat before, well, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually in room 8, just a few yards down the hall there, actually. You going down to the baths? I was thinking of heading down that way myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah. I ... I guess we can go together?&quot; Tony suggested uncertainly. He didn&#39;t actually know whether that would be okay or not. On the one hand, men and women bathing or just being naked together wasn&#39;t something he was used to being involved in except for sex. On the other hand, they would be expected to interact with everybody and everything without hiding their shame from now on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; Megan said with a shrug, stepping along beside him as nonchalantly as possible under the circumstances. Tony noticed that whenever she opened her mouth he could see long, white pointed teeth where her dainty human canines had been when he first met her. Her ears seemed to be perking up and down a little bit, too, just like his could. She might not have all the changes he did, but she was as obviously on the path to doggydom as he was. Even so, she still had an insanely sexy figure even by human standards, and he was unmistakably feeling his penis throbbing to attention at the sight of her. He noticed her catching a glimpse at it a couple of times but neither of them mentioned it. Tony decided to bring up some other subject to keep their minds off of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does this communal bathroom work, is it mainly for dog-washing, or--?&quot; he asked needlessly, trailing his voice at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s for human-style showers,&quot; Megan confirmed, in a voice that suggested he should already know this. (He did.) &quot;There are two showers, four sinks, and three toilets. Soap and towels are provided. If we lose the ability to make use of them, well, then our new trainers will clean us up from time to time as needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; he said, his erection starting to subside a little thanks to the small talk. That didn&#39;t stop his swollen tailbone from twitching wildly at his newfound freedom to walk around completely exposed next to the prettiest lady he&#39;d met in ages.</p>
