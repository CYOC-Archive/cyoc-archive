<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While you slept you thought about how you might get treated, you were a higher breed of basilisk so would they fear you, or see you as something different? Either way you didn’t care, at least you were getting away from that dragon especially after what he did to you.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts as you dreamed were interrupted suddenly when your body was slammed up against something rough and hard. Your eyes opened up and you could only make out blurry figures and loud noises that were too distorted to understand. &quot;What’s....happening?&quot; You thought as you lay on your side but then something knocked your cage into mid-air and you with it and it sent you flying up against something hard, but whatever it was shattered almost instantly. For a moment you actually felt happy that you were inside of a cage, but you were still flung around violently and your head bashed up against the side of the cave and passed out again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your next thoughts were fear like,&quot;What the hell happened? What did this? Am I dead?&quot; You didn’t quite know wat to think, but when you finally came to, you saw a large black creature, but certainly not dragon sized, with what seemed like multiple appendages looming over you. &quot;Hey...*mumbles*,&quot; the creature said then you saw it’s appendages waving around in very odd fashions, and you tried to move your body a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;*mumbles* she’s waking *mumbles*..... guys....*mumbles*.&quot; The creature continued then your vision slowly started getting clearer by the second and you could almost make out claws, black scales and a tail. &quot;Hold on, you know how to deal with these, right?&quot; The creature said then it paused and responded to itself and said,&quot;Of course, and we already took care of her eyes, so it’s fine.&quot; Then you heard a slightly deeper voice from the same creature and it said,&quot;Why one of these though? They’re supposed to be stronger right, and I&#39;ve never seen a female before.&quot;<br />
<br />
You quickly grew tired of whatever this creature was and you tried to stand up, but you heard a loud crack and a sharp pain in your back, your middle-left leg, your hind right leg and you felt like you had a migraine. &quot;Ugh! D...damnit!&quot; You growled then suddenly you looked up and saw the creature looking at you concerned and what’s more was that those appendages weren’t appendages at all, they were heads and a total of 7 of them. When you realized what this creature was your screamed because of its bizarre heads,&quot;GAAAH!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
The creature then rushed over to you and one of its heads looke at you and said,&quot;Hey, calm down we’re not your foes.&quot; Another one of the creature&#39;s heads followed up with,&quot;Don&#39;t move, your cage went through a tree, and if you continue to do that then you&#39;ll probably make your injuries worse.&quot; You paused then slumped back down and then you roared,&quot;WHAT ARE YOU!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature then paused for a moment and then the center head that was larger then the others spoke up,&quot;We&#39;re Galahad, and we&#39;re a hydra. Please just calm down or else you may give away our position to any passing humans.&quot; You paused then nodded and looked around and noticed the tree that had been snapped like a twig by your cage, and just beyond some bushes was a pathway of sorts; you were obviously in a forest. You then took a deep breath and sighed then said,&quot;I uh.....okay, sorry just....kind of traumatized really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s fine miss, and uh....I guess we should apologize.&quot; One of Galahad&#39;s heads said and it gave you a nervous smile that made you question it,&quot;Whyyy?&quot; Galahad’s center head then sighed and said,&quot;Look, guys when we all talk it gets confusing both between me and others, so maybe let’s just have me take this.&quot; The other heads paused at this then the slowly backed away from you and the central head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry just.....we know this is the path where that tyrant Dranik usually trades, or rather he uses to assault human convoys. We saw you in the cage being hauled by four basilisks, and one king basilisk like you....but male. However we may or may not have been fighting blind because of your species’s naturally deadly sight...and we knocked your cage all the way back here.&quot; Galahad explained then you nodded to him but you raised a brow and asked,&quot;Wait, then why aren’t you dying by looking into my eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Galahad sat down on his haunches then he stated,&quot;We neutralized that ability for the time being, it’s easier than you think. So now, before anything else I have to say that the main reason we freed you is because we have questions. So, are you a prisoner of Dranik&#39;s? If so then you must tell us everything that you know.&quot; You paused at this then you looked away blushing and you said,&quot;I.....Dranik? The....dragon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Galahad sighed then growled,&quot;Yes him! Are you sure you don’t have more than a concussion?&quot; You shook your head rapidly then said,&quot;M...My head hurts, but.....I don’t know much about him if....that’s what you want to know, but I hate him.&quot; Galahad raised his brow and asked,&quot;How so? It’s not often one finds another who was bred specifically to serve him out in a cage heading towards a human settlement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh....what are you saying?&quot; You whimpered blushing not wanting to say anything else then Galahad growled,&quot;I&#39;m saying that you need to give us a reason not to kill you, and you’re unwillingness is not helping your case.&quot; You grew nervous now and wondered if you should make up a half baked lie, but you couldn’t think of anything on the spot so you just nodded and said,&quot;Okay, honestly I don’t know anything about him, but.......I was.....a male human before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Galahad’s central head’s eyes widened at this then you heard some of the other heads conversing behind him,&quot;That would explain why she’s so clueless, she didn’t even know his name.&quot; Then another head said,&quot;You assume he lets her race know his name?&quot; Then a third head chimed in,&quot;Guys, let’s hear what she has to say first. If she was human it would explain at least some things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Galahad’s central head cleared his throat then he said,&quot;Well uh....that’s......almost unbelievable and horrifying if that’s true. Where is your home then? Is it a settlement close-by?&quot; You shook your head and said,&quot;No....I’m not from here, probably not even from this world. I found a weird temple and I heard his voice, and I tried to run but....the next thing I know was that I was like this. He then told me that I was to breed for him, and I refused. But when I did he threw a collar on me, stuck me in that cage saying that I would be sold at an auction, b....but....b....but not.....&quot; You started to cry now letting out whimpers as you stammered. Thinking back to that moment when you were in heat with him made you feel so emotional now for some reason. You didn’t find being violated by him as bad before but you&#39;ve accepted your place and you were in heat then. Those thoughts made tears run down your face at this point and the thought of Dranik doing that again made you feel afraid and vulnerable.<br />
<br />
Galahad then nudged you and said,&quot;Please, tell us, we promise that we won’t tell anyone else if that makes you feel better.&quot; You then roared,&quot;He raped me like this!!!&quot; You then looked down to your vagina and whimpered to yourself and thought,&quot;Why the hell am I feeling so emotional now?! I never have before during that scene, but.....what if it happens again? I&#39;ll be pregnant and....&quot; you paused mid-thought and you saw Galahad lay down all head shocked beyond belief and the central head said,&quot;W......wow, I....I’m so sorry, we didn’t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N....no it’s fine, just.....don’t bring it up again, alright?&quot; You asked and Galahad’s head&#39;s all nodded in unison, and he extended his central head up to you and he said,&quot;This must be quite an adjustment for you. We don’t know what you said is all true but....we know someone who can confirm this and at least clear your name around this area.&quot; One of the heads then added,&quot;Not that you&#39;d have one, buuuut your race is kind of under his iron claw.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The central head of Galahad groaned at his other head and he said,&quot;My other heads aside just trust us, please. That last detail doesn’t need to go public if you don’t want it to.&quot; Another one of Galahad’s heads then chimed in,&quot;Do you want your basilisk gaze back? We kind of stored it away with magic for now.&quot; The central head then growled,&quot;What did I say about confusing and speaking up you guys?!&quot; The other heads paused and backed off slowly then Galahad looked up to you and said,&quot;So, we can heal you enough to walk and take you to a place that’s safe where you can completely recover, but you’re going to have to trust us.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to Galahad and said,&quot;What choice do I have? I can’t risk anything else at this point.&quot; Galahad nodded and he extended his claw. The next think you saw happen was that green aura and sparkles shrouded over your body for a moment and you slowly stood up on your legs again, but they still hurt. &quot;You&#39;ll limp, but you’ll make it, sorry healing isn’t our strong suit.&quot; Galahad said and you nodded to him and said,&quot;Thank you,&quot; Galahad then shook his central head and it said,&quot;There’s still obstacles like scouting teams sent by Dranik, human hunting parties and poachers, and finally the usual risk of another creature who wants to fight because god knows why. Anyways just stay close and stay behind us if anything goes wrong.&quot; You nodded to Galahad and said,&quot;Sure....lead on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Galahad nodded to you and the two of you slowly began walking, and eventually the two of you came across....</p>
