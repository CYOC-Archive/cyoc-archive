<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jae met up with Luca at the Athletic center.  The guys at the frat said they haven&#39;t seen him all day&quot;<br />
&quot;No one has seen Ty...I&#39;m worried and scared.&quot;  Luca said, his voice shaking.<br />
Wrapping his arms around Luca to comfort him, Jae said &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can I not?  No one has seen or heard from  my bf...and you won&#39;t explain a thing.&quot; Luca said.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that...it didn&#39;t hurt you...it makes you our ace.&quot; Jae assured him.  &quot;Don&#39;t you think its weird that no one, including me, remembered Ty but you?&quot;<br />
&quot;That had crossed my mind&quot;<br />
&quot;The last time I talked to my brother, he was complaining about how he was the only good swimmer on the team and he was tired of losing.  I don&#39;t know how but I think he has definitely done something.&quot;<br />
Luca thought about the situation as he followed Jae in.  They headed to the pool.  As they reached the door, Luca hoped Jae&#39;s brother hadn&#39;t done anything.  Inside they were greeted by Kai and 6 other guys chatting.<br />
&quot;Jae!  What are you doing here?  Did you come to see one of my matches...finally?&quot; Kai said, almost in a mocking tone.<br />
Jae looked around for his crew, hoping beyond hope to see them and his beloved Park.  He had told them to meet here 10 min ago.  He looked angrily at Kai, &quot;What have you done Kai???  First Luca&#39;s boyfriend, then park and now the rest of my crew, is that it?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?  Who is that?  Why would you think I did anything?&quot;  Kai feigned innocence.<br />
&quot;WHERE IS TY? WHERE IS PARK? MARCO? SILAS? TRISTAN?  Those men do not have the look of the loser team you would constantly bitch about!&quot;  Jae yelled angerly as he approached.<br />
Kai smirked &quot;Why if he&#39;s your true love, shouldn&#39;t you recognize him?&quot;<br />
Horrified Jae said &quot;You didn&#39;t...!  HE WAS YOUR FRIEND TOO!&quot;<br />
&quot;He still is&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you care nothing for me and my heart?  Or Luca&#39;s heart?  Are you that hellbent on your selfish desire to win?&quot; Jae tried pleading.<br />
&quot;Kai laughed. &quot;You are such a hypocrite little brother! You manufactured it...just like me!&quot;<br />
&quot;No...not like you...nothing like you!  For some reason, even though he disappeared when he was with you, Ty&#39;s boyfriend remembered him, when everyone else forgot.  I showed everyone what changes I made and who they were before.  I let them read about who they had been and would become.  They chose to not only stay as they were but help search for Ty.  NOW WHERE ARE THEY?!?&quot; he roared.<br />
&quot;Surely your heart should be able to figure it out!  No?  Tony come here.  Let me introduce you to Jae...Jae this is Tony.&quot; Kai said mockingly as Tony merely scoffed, went back to Cole and kissed him.<br />
&quot;You son of a bitch!&quot; Jae charged forth, tears streaming from his eyes.<br />
&quot;Oh little brother..maybe a few more years of experience, you&#39;d have learned that you should never bring a knife to a gun fight.&quot;  he said as he pulled out the iPad like device that housed his version of the maker, causing Jae to freeze.<br />
&quot;But how?&quot; Jae was clearly confused.<br />
&quot;Remember that night you and Park...or should I say Tony, found me in your room?  Well I came across your maker program and made a copy of it.&quot; Kai said.  &quot;Now you...the muscly little that seems to be cowering behind my brother.  You&#39;re the one who started this.  I don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t forget but why don&#39;t I make you a deal.&quot;  he said pressing a button.  &quot;Now you..the muscly little thing that appears to be cowering behind my little brother.  You&#39;re the one that had started all of this.  I don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t forget but why don&#39;t I make you a deal.&quot; He said pressing a button.<br />
Jae screamed out in pain as his bones lengthen until he was 6&#39;5.  When they finished, they also thickened.  His feet burst through his shoes.  His calves and thighs grew muscles, the kind you get from years of bodybuilding.<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this?  Why is he in so much pain?  He&#39;s your brother!&quot; Marco screamed.<br />
Jae moaned in pleasure as he felt his cock grow out to 12 in.  Then he watched as his pecs become huge slabs of muscle.  His fingers thickened, his forearms grew more muscular  and his biceps exploded.  &quot;NO!  Don&#39;t!&quot; he yelled.  <br />
Luca watched in utter shock as Jae continued to change.  His lips became fuller and his nose widened.  As his skin tone began to change, Luca realized what was happening. &quot;No! no no no no no!  Why are you doing this?&quot; he shouted.  Jae had been transformed into Ty.<br />
&quot;I have what I need with my team.  If my brother hadn&#39;t made a scene, I would have let you and he go.  Instead, I&#39;ll let you and your boyfriend go...just forget it all.&quot;  Kai said.<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; Luca sobbed<br />
&quot;hey baby...what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Ty asked as he put his arms around Luca.<br />
Luca immediately shrugged him off and said &quot;You aren&#39;t my Ty&quot; He then looked to Kai &quot;I know that my Ty is gone.  I know you did something to my friends.  I know that there is nothing I can do.  Please...Just let me hug them goodbye and Ill leave and never come back&quot; he said through tears.  Kai motioned for him to go ahead.<br />
Luca walked up to the group and went down the line where they had been standing.  He approached Cole, hugging him tightly, followed by Cal, then Anthony, then Dre and DeShaun.  He didn&#39;t stop there, he hugged Solomon and Kechyen, followed by Ty and then, much to his surprise, Kai.  He then walked away, tears streaming.  As he reached the door, he looked to see if anyone was looking and quickly ducked under the bleachers.  He then heard Kai yell &quot;What did you do you little bastard??&quot;<br />
Luca peered around the bleachers adn was amazing at what he saw.  Dre an DeShaun reverted back to Silas and Tristan, fake Ty became Jae, Anthony became Park, Kechyen was back to Marco, and lastly Cole was back to being Ty.  Next the maker that Kai was using broke in half.  Luca, wiping his tears away, came from behind the bleachers and ran to Ty, embracing him, his head leaning against Ty.<br />
&quot;What makes you think did anything...little brother?&quot;  Jae said grinning.<br />
&quot;Little...OMG!&quot; Kai yelled.  He watched his bag change to  a skateboard.  &quot;How?&quot;<br />
&quot;You think I hadn&#39;t seen what you had done and to whom before we came here?  I have the master program...you downloaded a secondary.  I knew Luca had a huge capacity for unconditional love, so I implanted him, with his permission, a one time version of the program, just in case.  While he didn&#39;t realize it, the program I implanted had one simple task...all you had to do was come in contact with anyone who was changed and they would revert.  Not that you&#39;ll remember any of this in 30 seconds, because in 30 seconds you&#39;re change will be done.<br />
&quot;I hate you!&quot; Kai hissed before getting a blank look on his face.  He looked up at Jae, asking &quot;Can we go big brother?&quot;  As Jae and Kai talked, Solomon and Cal became 14 year old versions of themselves.  Luca and Ty were already sharing passionate kiss as were Jae and Park...and for the first time, Silas and Marco.  Luca hugged everyone in Jae&#39;s crew again.  They then left the campus and headed back to Jae&#39;s.</p>
