<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone, including Tony, gathered at Sarah's house, to keep Tony from see where it was, he was blindfolded. Then everyone went to sleep, to prepare for questioning Tony about Brad's hideout. The next morning, you woke up and decided to test the theory. You successfully turned into a mist.<br />
<br />
Megan saw you reform and saw the sun up. &quot;So it's true you you are that legendary vampire, Aunt Violet. Sarah will be so pleased, well except for the whole death after a few years thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hi, Megan, well unlike the others, I can tell when something bad is about to happen.&quot; You responded.<br />
<br />
Both of you headed downstairs, and saw the others. &quot;Sarah, Aunt Violet is the legendary vampire.&quot; Megan said as she met the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan, you need to address Sarah as Head Council, and Violet as Head Daughter.&quot; Jason scolded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, Jason, while alone like this, I'll allow her to address me by name, she is Violet's niece after all.&quot; Sarah corrected. &quot;As for you, Violet, I'm pleased I can finally meet one of the legendary vampires of our clan. Now for you, Tony, will you tell us the location of Brad's hideout? He needs to pay for those humans he killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you mean pay? you planning on killing them?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we'll just relay the info to my step-father, he's a lieutenant, on the force, and the head of the newest police department. he'll put together a SWAT team to go there and arrest the people inside.&quot; You said.<br />
<br />
&quot;New department?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Paranormal Special Investigations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OHHHHHHHHH!!!!! We definitely gotta call Grandpa, he thinks we all died last night!!!!&quot;Megan said as her eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you............ Oh you're right, I forgot we faked our deaths for Brad. Sarah does the phone work?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, here.&quot; Sarah tossed you the phone, you start dialing the office number. &quot;Now, Tony, I give you my word, that my clan will not attack the hideout, we'll just inform the proper authorities. Will you tell us where Brad is hiding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, if you are right and they did kill humans, that is different. I can't condone that. Brad is hiding at the old abandoned warehouse close to the art center.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Violet, before you hang up tell him that they are at the warehouse next to the art center.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on dad.&quot; you cover the mouth piece, &quot;ok Sarah, also next time we fake our deaths, we really ought to tell dad. He threw a fit, now he's chewing me out for not telling him earlier.&quot; you turn back to the phone. &quot;Dad, our information says the leader is named Brad, and they are hiding at the warehouse next to the art center.&quot; then you hang up the phone. &quot;Well dad said he'd send in a SWAT team to deal with it. It should be done in about 20 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully. Lets just hope he doesn't do something royally stupid like kill the SWAT team.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a fanatic, he'll die or kill the cops before he allows the cops to 'stop him from completing his mission'.&quot; Beth added. &quot;However it ends, it won't be pretty, I think we should go and help them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't allow that, you heard me give my word to Tony, and he still has that binding amulet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah's right, we can't help the cops. You all are really no different then humans in sunlight. As for me, I won't betray Sarah like that. She granted me my two biggest desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And those would be?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being a vampire and being a real girl.&quot; You answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I even want to ask?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was a 36 year old male, who wished to be a female and had a thing about vampires, now thanks to Sarah, I am now a 13 year old vampiress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But now You can never drive a car for eternity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I can, in another 16 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think someone would allow a 13 year old to drive, the legal driving age is 16.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why I need to wait 16 years, at that point, I'll be able to adjust my apparent age to 16, and I can drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you hear that Violet?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason told me when we were talking about him turning Megan, he said we can adjust our apparent ages, from our turned age to our actual vampire age, as long as our actual age is higher then our turned age. So in 16 years, I'll be able to appear as a 16 year old girl, but not before then. At least that's what he said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jason is right, I personally was going to tell you when you turned 13. After all, you seemed a bit upset at first.&quot; Sarah confirmed.<br />
<br />
Soon there was a call to the house. &quot;Hello?&quot; Sarah answered. &quot;OK bad news first..... I see ....... well that's a bit better. OK i'll tell them.&quot; Sarah hung up the phone. &quot;Bad news, Brad escaped the SWAT assault, but they did arrest 12 others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say 12? That's weird.&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK what's weird?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not counting Brad or me, there are only 11 members of the group I know of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could number 12 be a new member, to replace you, after you know, your death?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but then that means number 12 is innocent. He, or she, didn't kill those humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK the gang is caught time for part two, catching Brad himself. Well I said it yesterday, Violet will have to face Brad alone, she's the only one of us who stands a chance.&quot; Sarah stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you gave your word.&quot; Tony reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't you learn anything yesterday? You have to be careful how the promise is worded. I gave my word that if you told us where the hideout was we wouldn't attack it, I never said anything about not going after Brad outside the hideout.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to kill him?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we prefer to not kill humans, but he may leave us no choice in the matter, Violet may be forced to kill him to save her own skin. I prefer she survives over that heartless killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria slapped my face when she found out you attacked her housemates.&quot; Violet added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maria?&quot; Tony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A woman who works at the morgue, she was part of a group that worships vampires. Her housemates were also members of the group.&quot; Megan added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I, I'm sorry, I didn't know.&quot; Tony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not your fault, it's Brad's. He lied to all of you about that university house. Those humans are on his head.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
20 minutes earlier<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright team, this is where those mass murderers are supposed to be hiding, they'll claim that the were killing vampires, but according to the PSI head, they murdered innocent humans. they are dangerous, so we do this one by the book.&quot; SWAT commander relayed to his men. turns his attention to the team member looking through a fiber optic lens. &quot;OK have you confirmed they are in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir. There are 12 people in there. Looks like they are unarmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's move.&quot; two members used a mobile battering ram to smash down the door, then four gas grenades are thrown in before the hunters could go for their weapons. SWAT swarmed them with their machine guns at the ready, shouting &quot;Freeze!!&quot; and &quot;Don't Move!!!!&quot; After checking the IDs of all the hunters, the SWAT commander called up the head of PSI. &quot;Sir job was a partial success, your informant was right, the hunters were here, but well the one named Brad is gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fools are betraying your species, we only hurt the soulless blood sucking monsters, that would suck you dry given half a chance.&quot; spat Lisa, one of the hunters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look lady, all I know is this. My boss was informed of this hideout, the name of your leader is Brad, and VAMPIRES DON'T EXIST!!!!! We were instructed to apprehend you for murdering those innocent collage students. Now unless you want to face the death sentence, then cooperate and tell us where we can find Brad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never, we'd rather die then see you interfere with our holy mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll see if you hold up during interrogation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So traitor, what did they offer you? Money? Women? Immortality? what ever it was, I hope for your sake, that those vampires you made a deal with keep their end of the deal, instead of just killing you. Unless you're just the middleman, maybe they made a deal with your bosses, and are using you as their unwitting pawn. If that's the case, I feel sorry for you, because they definitely won't let you live after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
All of a sudden the warehouse blows up. &quot;Farewell my friends, don't worry i'll make sure your sacrifice will always be remembered. I'll destroy the vampires that made me kill you.&quot; Brad said as he walked away. A few moments later sirens could be heard.</p>
