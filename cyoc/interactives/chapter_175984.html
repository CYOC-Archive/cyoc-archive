<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob: Let&#39;s act like teens that have been regressed and talk like toddlers, and over time let&#39;s begin to act younger and younger.<br />
<br />
Greg: That would be so much fun! That way we can always keep them off guard. How about every time one of us sticks out our tongue to the other we act a bit younger. I was also wondering, should we be potty trained?<br />
<br />
Jacob: Absolutely not. It was your idea to be babies so if we are going to be babies then we are actually going to be diapered babies.<br />
<br />
Greg: If you say so haha.<br />
<br />
Jacob: Make sure that you delete these texts, we don&#39;t want to incriminate ourselves. <br />
<br />
Both Jacob and Greg went through their phones to delete their texts. Greg went to delete his but just as he was about to hit delete but was surprised when the door to the bedroom flew open dropping his phone in surprise and not actually deleting the texts.<br />
<br />
Greg&#39;s mother Diane walks in while saying: &quot;Rise and shine Greg! Its starting to get a bit late in the day for you to still be sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane looks around and rather than seeing her son only sees a toddler in the bed. &quot;What in the world? Hey little boy are you lost?&quot; She asked not knowing that she was speaking to her son. Greg almost could almost not stop himself from starting to laugh. Let the fun begin he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom it&#39;s me, Greg! I think ive thwunk ovenight!&quot; he said adding in a fake lisp for shrunk. Diane looks at her son in shock and horror. &quot;Greg what happened to you? You haven&#39;t shrunk you look like you are three yours old!&quot; She picks Greg up and takes his oversized clothes off of him. She then holds him up naked, armlength and eyelevel in front of herself. At this Greg is a little embarrassed to  be completely naked in front of his mom and his face starts turning red. &quot;How did this happen?&quot; she asked her son hoping he knew the answer. &quot;I don&#39;t know mom. I woke up little I pwomise!&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane then begins to wonder about Jacob. She adjusts Greg to hold his naked body on her hip and walks quickly to Jacob&#39;s room. She opens it up and to her shock she sees another naked toddler in a bed. &quot;JACOB!&quot; she shrieks, &quot;YOU TOO!&quot; She isn&#39;t mad but horrified to see her friend&#39;s son has also been regressed. Jacob almost smiles before keeping his composure and says, &quot;I woke up widdle!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Diane picks up Jacob takes off his overgrown under ware and carries both Jacob and Greg&#39;s naked bodies to the living room and puts them on the the thick soft white rug. &quot;Jake!&quot; she yells, &quot;YOU NEED TO GET DOWN HERE NOW!&quot; Diane starts running upstairs to grab her husband. Jacob and Greg look at each others naked bodies on the rug and they start to laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha your dick is so small,&quot; Jacob mocked, &quot;you&#39;ll never be able to get another girlfriend now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look whose talking, yours looks non-existant haha!&quot; Greg laughed, &quot;Dude how crazy is this that we are a couple of naked babies right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude I know! This morning I tried to stand up and I was so wobly. I might have to try to speak like a toddler but acting like one should be pretty simple. Also I peed myself last night. I don&#39;t think that we have too much faking to do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
 At that moment Diane came down with Jake. &quot;Holy shit! I thought you were joking. They really are babies!&quot; Greg&#39;s dad exclaimed. &quot;I noticed that Jacob even pissed his bed when I grabbed him this morning,&quot; explained Diane, &quot;so boys I am afraid that some protection is going to be necessary. Thankfully I always bring work supplies with me in case I find new clients.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then untucked two white diapers from under her arm. They both had some cartoon prints on them. &quot;Don&#39;t be embarrassed boys, I have already seen you both naked when you were younger.&quot; She grabbed Greg and lifted up his legs and placed the diaper under his butt. Greg started blushing being naked before his mom and dad. There was something very vulnerable about having your genitals exposed before your own mother. She took out the baby powder and sprinkled his dick and balls generously with it. Finally she taped the diaper back up between his legs and placed him back on the carpet. <br />
<br />
Next she took Jacob and placed him down. Jacob had always had a crush on Diane. She was always very pretty but he had never told anyone about it. Jacob found it erotic having the woman of his fantasies start to diaper him. When she powdered him he started getting hard. &quot;Is someone excited?&quot; asked Diane, &quot;Don&#39;t worry ill get you changed quickly.&quot; At this moment Jacob started breathing in baby powder and he started coughing repeatedly. &quot;Are you sick Jacob?&quot; asked Diane. &quot;I feel a widdle sick. Why?&quot; asked Jacob curiously. &quot;Well I am afraid I am going to have to check your temperature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane pulled out a thermometer and Jacob opened his mouth so she could put it in his mouth. &quot;Jacob I am afraid you dont check babies temperatures that way. This is going to have to up your bum...&quot; she said slowly. &quot;WAIT! WHAT! NO I DONT WANT THAT!&quot; said Jacob in genuine shock. He had never had anything like this happen to him before. &quot;Dont worry this wont be painful,&quot; she said as she dipped it in petroleum jelly. Jacob started kicking his legs to stop her but she simply lifted his legs and gently inserted the thermometer up his butt. Jacob immediately quieted down when this happened. &quot;See not so bad as she took it out. Well your temperature is a little high so I might have to check your temperature throughout the day to make sure. This might have to do with why you both shrunk. Greg I will have to check yours later as well then.&quot; Greg immediately went pale when he heard that. She finished diapering Jacob and put him down beside Greg. <br />
<br />
Diane started tearing up at the site of them both being diapered toddlers together on the rug. &quot;Even though this is a scary situation, I cant help but feel a little happy at seeing you both like this again. I am going to take some pictures.&quot; She hurriedly left to grab her camera. &quot;Dude my mom just stuck something up your butt,&quot; laughed Greg. &quot;You just wait for your turn then we will see whose laughing then.&quot; warned Jacob. <br />
<br />
Diane came back. &quot;Okay, I am going to take some pictures of you two, but it will look cuter with a bunch of props,&quot; she then pulled out a bag full of....</p>
