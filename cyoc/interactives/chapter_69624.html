<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi looked down, uncertain.  &quot;Actually, I was just wondering...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yukiko flew up to her mistress, searching her face for a clue.  &quot;Yes?  You can tell me anything, Naomi.&quot;  <br />
Naomi looked up at her fairy, and mumbled &quot;Well, you're so pretty, and all...and kind...and, well, magical...&quot;  <br />
Yukiko giggled again.  &quot;Out with it!  What can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be your baby!&quot; Naomi cried suddenly, putting her hand over her mouth in shock at her outburst.  <br />
Yukiko's eyes went wide, and she froze for a moment before floating over and embracing the girl.  &quot;Oh, Naomi, <br />
you don't know how much that means to me...&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what do you mean?&quot; Naomi asked, puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Yukiko began, &quot;We fairies don't reproduce the way you humans do - get pregnant, or anything.  We grow <br />
our children in the earth when we need them, and they feed on the nectar of flowers instead of milk,&quot; she <br />
said.  &quot;It's every fairy's dream to give birth to a child, to hold a life inside their bellies, but they can't <br />
do it unless invited.&quot;  Yukiko brightened.  &quot;But are you really willing to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi took a deep breath, then nodded.  &quot;Yes, Yukiko, I am.  I want to be taken care of again, I want a new <br />
mother, however temporarily, and I want to make you as happy as you'll make me.  I'm ready,&quot; she stated.<br />
<br />
Yukiko clasped her hands together, squealing with joy and spinning in the air.  &quot;You're the best human ever!&quot; <br />
she cried.  Naomi watched her, smiling but still somewhat nervous.  &quot;So how do we do this?&quot; she asked, <br />
uncertain.<br />
<br />
Yukiko smiled.  &quot;It starts with a wish,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded.  &quot;Yukiko...I wish you would become pregnant with me and give birth to me and raise me as my <br />
mother for...&quot; she paused.  &quot;...for a week!&quot;  That seemed long enough, Naomi thought.  Then she could go back <br />
to her old life refreshed, and Yukiko would be happy.<br />
<br />
Yukiko's body shimmered as she floated to the ground, and she began to grow.  From seven inches she gained a <br />
foot in height in ten seconds, quickly attaining the build of a normal human in no more than a minute.  Naomi <br />
watched, awed, as the small fairy became human-sized before her eyes.  Yukiko flexed for a moment, enjoying <br />
her new size, and then wrapped Naomi in a hug.  &quot;Thanks again, Naomi,&quot; she said, running her fingers through <br />
the human's hair.  Naomi hugged the fairy back, marveling at her softness.  She was shorter than Yukiko now, <br />
coming to just above her breasts.  Naomi, embarrassed, tried to pull away, but Yukiko placed a hand on the <br />
back of her neck and leaned Naomi's head against her chest, resting her chin on the girl's head.  &quot;No need to <br />
be shy,&quot; she said, stroking the girl's shoulders.  &quot;After all, the two of us are going to be very close in a <br />
bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi froze for a moment, before accepting this and pressing herself against Yukiko, resting her head on the <br />
fairy's large breasts.  She briefly imagined herself sucking on them, and was glad the fairy couldn't see her <br />
blushing.  They stayed like that for several seconds before Naomi felt something warm on her torso.  She put <br />
her hands to Yukiko's stomach, noticing that the area beneath her navel was heating up.  &quot;Yukiko?  What's <br />
going on?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Yukiko noticed it too, and she disengaged herself from Naomi, stepping back and rubbing her abdomen.  &quot;It's <br />
the first stage in the ritual, Naomi.  It was invented long ago by the first fairy to do this, and has rarely <br />
been invoked since.  The first change is in my womb, which swells and thickens.  A placenta is forming right <br />
now - it'll be your home soon,&quot; Yukiko said, smiling at her soon-to-be daughter.  Yukiko closed her eyes, <br />
rubbing her belly and smiling as the nourishing organ formed inside her.  Naomi watched, enthralled, and saw <br />
Yukiko's belly swell out very slightly - the smallest of bumps growing under her navel.  Something within the <br />
fairy caused the skin to ripple after a few seconds, and Yukiko clutched her belly, gasping at the movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stage two,&quot; she said, spreading her legs where she stood.  &quot;The umbilical cord.  It grows and grows, and when <br />
it comes out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You put it in me,&quot; Naomi finished, amazed.  A thought came to her suddenly.  &quot;Yukiko...will I remember this?  <br />
Will I forget my old life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not completely,&quot; Yukiko answered, feeling her cervix dilate slowly to allow the umbilical cord an exit.  <br />
&quot;Once you are inside me, your baby instincts will temporarily take over and you won't know anything other than <br />
my being your mother.  But you'll remember it all when you grow up again, and after you'll remember being in <br />
my womb.  Speaking of which...&quot; Yukiko felt the umbilical cord against her walls as it snaked down her vagina.  <br />
She pulled down the panties on her costume, revealing hairless labia that puffed up and darkened for pregnancy <br />
when the umbilical cord reached them.  Her lips spread apart, and the cord grew out of her, inch by inch as <br />
she moaned in delight.<br />
<br />
Naomi thought Yukiko looked pretty funny with the umbilical cord hanging out of her, and she giggled, abruptly <br />
holding her breath when Yukiko reached down and picked it up.  She was about to take a step she'd never be <br />
able to take back.  &quot;Are you ready for this, Naomi?  Are you ready to become part of my body?&quot; Yukiko asked.  <br />
Naomi hesitated, rubbing her belly button uncertainly.  Finally she nodded.  &quot;Make me your baby,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Yukiko stepped toward Naomi, the umbilical cord growing ever longer out of her.  She took Naomi's shirt and <br />
lifted it with one hand, guiding the cord to her navel with the other.  The fleshy tube brushed Naomi's tummy, <br />
and she shut her eyes and breathed in sharply as she felt it fuse to her.  Naomi waited a moment, looking down <br />
uncertainly after a second or two.<br />
<br />
The pinkish cord - her umbilical cord - grew from her belly, hanging down a few feet before looping back up <br />
into Yukiko's vagina.  Naomi touched it with a shaking hand, shocked that she could actually feel her hand on <br />
it, that this thing was a part of her body now.  She tugged it experimentally, and it pulled at the skin on <br />
her stomach.  No going back.  She looked in Yukiko's eyes, held her hands.  Nothing but motherly affection <br />
stared back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's really happening,&quot; Yukiko whispered.  &quot;You're really becoming my baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi nodded, catching a glance in the mirror.  She and Yukiko giggled at the sight - a teenage girl holding <br />
hands with a grown woman, an umbilical cord running from under the former's shirt and between the legs of the <br />
latter.  &quot;Hey, Yukiko?&quot; asked Naomi.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Naomi?&quot; Yukiko asked, absently rubbing her belly in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I call you 'Mom?'&quot;<br />
<br />
The words brought tears to Yukiko's eyes, and she threw her arms around Naomi, crying softly.  &quot;Of course you <br />
can,&quot; she said, &quot;of course you can, my beautiful, wonderful daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi started to cry, too, so happy at what was happening - and then she felt her stomach get warm.  &quot;My tummy <br />
feels funny,&quot; she said to Yukiko.<br />
<br />
Yukiko smiled gently at her, gesturing to look down.  Naomi saw the umbilical cord thicken as fluids poured <br />
through it from Yukiko's womb.  The fluid flowed into Naomi's belly, and she shivered, her entire body <br />
tingling.  &quot;Stage three,&quot; Yukiko said.  &quot;My body is pumping hormones into yours that will make you younger, <br />
make you ready to become a part of me.  It's almost time.  You will want to strip for this, Naomi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yukiko walked over to Naomi's bed, laying down in the middle of it, and Naomi followed her, aware that only <br />
four feet of cord connected them.  She pulled off her shirt, exposing her corded belly.  Naomi unhooked her <br />
bra for the last time in a short while, letting it fall and showing her small breasts to Yukiko.  She pulled <br />
her pants and panties down, her vulva on display.  Frustratingly, her pubic hair had been quickest to develop <br />
throughout puberty.  Yukiko giggled, and Naomi blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be embarrassed, Naomi - you're just a late bloomer.  I will tell you that some of my genes will enhance <br />
yours in my womb - you just might grow up more...gifted than you are now.&quot;  Yukiko took off the rest of her <br />
costume, showing Naomi her large, perky D-cup breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Naomi breathed, feeling an odd tingle in her belly.  She looked down, and gasped.  The liquid <br />
pumping into her belly was reversing her age!  Her dark, curly pubic hair was retracting into her, revealing <br />
labia that were shrinking from her pubescent size.  Within her her womb was shrinking, her ovaries dormant - <br />
she wouldn't need them for the time being.  She looked at her chest, and gave a cry of amazement as the small <br />
mounds sank into her chest, her nipples tingling as they shrank.  She felt herself getting shorter, her hair <br />
slowly retracting as Yukiko beckoned to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're getting younger, Naomi.  Soon you'll be a baby in my womb,&quot; Yukiko said.  &quot;I'd say you're about eight <br />
and counting,&quot; Yukiko told her as she motioned for Naomi to climb onto the bed.  As Naomi youthened Yukiko's <br />
body was undergoing its own changes.  She lay back and spread her legs farther apart as her hips widened to <br />
childbearing proportions, and her thighs thickened in preparation for carrying a child.  Her labia were dark <br />
and swollen, and she scratched between her legs as pubic hair began to grow in.  Her breasts were humming with <br />
warmth, and Yukiko felt them being pumped full of milk for her daughter.  Her nipples swelled and darkened, <br />
the areolas broadening and the area around them reddening with pressure as her breasts became larger, rounder, <br />
fuller.<br />
<br />
Naomi knelt between Yukiko's legs, a four-year-old with an umbilical cord.  &quot;Mommy?&quot; she asked as she de-aged <br />
faster and faster.  &quot;Yes, Naomi?&quot; Yukiko asked, caressing her strange, changing body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Those three words melted Yukiko's heart, and she sat up to embrace her almost-child.  She held Naomi in her <br />
arms, no more than a tiny infant as she kissed her on the forehead.  She felt a lurch within her belly and lay <br />
back again, feeling the umbilical cord reel back through her vagina and into her womb.  &quot;I love you too,&quot; she <br />
whispered, lowering Naomi between her legs.<br />
<br />
The umbilical cord got shorter and shorter, pulling Naomi closer and closer, until finally Yukiko spread her <br />
legs as far as they would go and guided Naomi's feet into her warm wetness.  The feeling was alien and <br />
wonderful, and as the umbilical cord grew taut she pushed Naomi gently into her birth canal.  Naomi smiled <br />
toothlessly, waving goodbye to Yukiko as the fairy's lips engulfed her tiny body up to the waist.  Yukiko <br />
watched her go, taking deeper and deeper breaths as her instincts began to take over.  Her muscles tightened, <br />
from her swollen opening through her cervix and to the very top of her womb, and she cried out as she <br />
experienced her first ever contraction, drawing Naomi inside her.  Her lips sucked Naomi in up to her stomach, <br />
the umbilical cord disappearing completely.  Yukiko cried out in unfamiliar discomfort and even pain, the <br />
invader pressing deeper and deeper into her.  More contractions brought Naomi's arms inside and pulled her in <br />
up to her shoulders.  Yukiko was alternately gasping and crying, tears of pain and joy, as she was stretched <br />
to her limits.  Naomi's shoulders were engulfed, and a hard round bulge was forming in Yukiko's abdomen.  She <br />
writhed in the throes of reverse labor as Naomi's head sank inside her; when she felt her lower lips come <br />
together around Naomi she knew the hard part was almost over.  She raised herself up on her shoulders, <br />
watching her belly expand as her muscles drew Naomi through her vagina, through her gaping cervix and finally <br />
into her swollen womb.<br />
<br />
It was done.  Her contractions grew weaker and weaker as Naomi settled into her new home.  Her labia became <br />
less swollen as her vagina tightened to pre-birth proportions.  Her cervix sealed again, locking Naomi in her <br />
uterus.<br />
<br />
Yukiko cried anew, happily, as she explored her new, pregnant body.  She hefted her milk-filled breasts, <br />
admiring the fullness and weight, and her hands finally settled on her huge, gravid belly.  A dark line had <br />
formed down the middle, running through her popped-out navel.  Deep within her, Naomi slept, waiting for her <br />
second birthday.</p>
