<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nyx&#39;s time with the Harris family had been more enjoyable than she had thought. She had found herself beginning to form a close bond with Kari the most out of all of Aaron&#39;s siblings. She talked about her other siblings and how if Haley were ever to meet Duncan, than they would have a lot of laughs together, possibly even become best friends. She also talked about her brother Andrew and how in some ways he and Aaron showed some similarities, she even commented to Mason that she thought Mason might some of Andrew&#39;s traits but Mason was adamant that Nyx&#39;s brother could ever change Mason&#39;s admiration of his big brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Nyx, have you met leaders from other realms before? I assume so if your parents are rulers of the vampire realm.&quot; Mika asked Nyx as they sat down at the dinner table with Nyx.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically my parents are just the lord and lady of one part of the vampire realm, there are others. I did get to meet Tatsu and Shizen once too when they came to visit my parents.&quot; Nyx explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! You got to meet our grandma and grandpa before you met Aaron? They must&#39;ve really liked you.&quot; Mason commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was more of a formal thing. Shizen was really nice, but I did feel a little intimidated by Tatsu because of his height and well....he is the leader of the kitsune realm.&quot; Nyx replied as she ate her meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, don&#39;t let gramps scare you, he may look intimidating, scary, and powerful.....and he is all that. But deep down, he&#39;s a big softy when it comes to his grandkids&quot; Haley said brushing it off as she ate her dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and lady Shi....I mean, grandma is a terrific judge of character. Believe us when she says that when she looks at you, she&#39;s looking into your very soul. So she must&#39;ve really liked you when she met you, even if it was brief. I&#39;m sure if you meet her again, she&#39;ll think of you as family.&quot; Kari said as Nyx nodded with a little smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Nyx was almost in disbelief at the compassion radiated by the Harris family. If this was the family that Aaron was raised in, then it was no wonder Aaron turned out the way he did. Nyx was wishing on the inside that Aaron would suddenly show up to the front door of the house so she could see him again. Suddenly there came a knock at the front door of the Harris household and everyone turned to look. Nyx&#39;s heart leapt thinking it was Aaron for a moment, but realized that wouldn&#39;t be right if Aaron knocked at his own door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anybody expecting anyone?&quot; Claudia asked everyone as they all shook their heads &#39;no&#39;. The family got up from the dinner table along with Nyx and Fenrir who traveled in the back of the group. Claudia cautiously opened the door and was a little surprised to see a Japanese woman standing before the front door there as she politely bowed her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening to you, is Nyx Tepes here?&quot; The woman asked Claudia and Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....Nyx, do you know this woman?&quot; Claudia asked as Nyx came up to the woman and gave her a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Hanako, I didn&#39;t expect you to come here.&quot; Nyx said as she looked up at the woman with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s your aunt? I didn&#39;t think your parents had any other siblings besides your uncle.&quot; Mika commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....she&#39;s more like my great, great....&quot; Nyx began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem!&quot; Hanako said clearing her throat obviously not wanting to feel old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....so, yeah, she&#39;s my aunt Hanako.&quot; Nyx said with a little blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please forgive my intrusion, but I was checking up on my nieces. I observed Andromeda not long ago and she was in good spirits with the Morelands.&quot; Hanako explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course she is, Andromeda can make anybody happy with her smile.&quot; Nyx said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I thought I would come check on you and see how your evening is progressing.&quot; Hanako continued to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re fine aunt Hanako, so...&quot; Nyx began to explain before a voice behind them interrupted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re fine vampire, now leave.&quot; A voice said as Hanako turned and the rest looked behind them to see Abolith standing there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh....Hanako, was it? This is....&quot; Mika began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith.&quot; Hanako said towards the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hanako.&quot; Abolith replied back to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you two know each other?&quot; Nyx asked Hanako.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Hanako and Abolith both answered as Nyx and the Harris family saw there was some tension between the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....look, I really don&#39;t want....anything to happen out here in front of where the neighbors might see, so why don&#39;t you two come inside and we can all talk more?&quot; Mika suggested as Abolith and Hanako looked at one another then towards the Harris family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for inviting me into your home.&quot; Hanako said as she bowed politely towards the Harris family and proceeded inside and took off her shoes.<br />
<br />
Abolith followed beside her and made her way inside and closed the door behind them. Now Nyx and the Harris family were about to hear the history shared between Abolith and Hanako.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Mika asked. &quot;Do I really want to ask how you two know each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a...professional relationship.&quot; Abolith replied, the elf’s icy glare focused on Hanako.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like a rivalry,&quot; Hanako added. &quot;I&#39;ve faced Abolith before. Pretty sure she was wearing the same outfit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith reached up, removing the veil that was covered her face. The elf’s delicate features rigid as she glowered at the dhamphir. &quot;You cost me a payday vampire,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Protecting a corrupt CEO.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a dhamphir elf,&quot; Hanako retorted. &quot;In case you&#39;ve forgotten those allegations were proven false. And you cost me a job when you assassinated that UN delegate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was foolish of you to think you could match my skill dhamphir,&quot; Abolith smirked. &quot;Being the blood heir of Dracula can only take you so far in life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least my reputation isn&#39;t built on being the arm candy of a maniacal general,&quot; Hanako spat.<br />
<br />
Abolith grit her teeth in rage, her face turning red as she gripped the hilt of her scimitar. &quot;Spoiled brat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Murderous cow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa HOLD IT!&quot; Claudia exclaimed, the petite sorceress now transforming, taking on the appearance of a massive, flaming tigress. Pushing the pair apart, the fire avatar growled at the pair. &quot;Look whatever issues you two have are not getting hashed out in MY LIVING ROOM!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith and Hanako paused, furrowing their brow at one another. &quot;You look well Abolith,&quot; Hanako stated. &quot;I had the pleasure of meeting your nephew. Aaron is a terrific young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate that Hanako,&quot; Abolith replied. &quot;I&#39;ve watched Nyx since her arrival. You have done a wonderful job in helping to raise her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nyx and the Harris siblings now paused, looking between one another in utter confusion. It seemed their aunts had a complicated love/hate relationship. One that none of them would ever truly understand.</p>
