<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gathered Harpers and Jenkins just stood there and stared at Elizabeth Harper.<br />
They had absolutely no idea what might be going through her mind right now, which was why Mrs. Jenkins suggested in a low voice, &quot;Perhaps we should leave.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good idea,&quot; agreed James Harper Junior, to which everyone at the entrance of Moon Lake General Hospital&#39;s ICU unit turned to leave.<br />
They were surprised though that Doctor Tora Tachibana followed them.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t any of you want to see the patient?&quot; he asked, now that they were back out in a common hallway.<br />
&quot;It might be for the best that we don&#39;t right now,&quot; realized James Junior. &quot;Dad was never a reasonable man even on his best days, and given the current situation...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Tachibana, nodding his head in agreement. &quot;So, what are your plans?&quot;<br />
&quot;The earliest we can acquire the forms, let alone file for Janice and John&#39;s emancipation is Monday,&quot; realized Jennifer Harper-Jenkins.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not even sure how we&#39;re going to fly back to Alabama yet, let alone when, even if John and Janice are there just long enough to pack their bags and come back here to stay with you,&quot; James Junior told his oldest sister.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it will be at least a week at the earliest before I would consider releasing your father for a flight home, even under medical supervision,&quot; replied Doctor Tachibana.<br />
&quot;Besides, by now dad and Dieter Wilhelm figured to be already dragging you back to Alabama, so all any of us have are the clothes we&#39;re wearing at the moment,&quot; added James Junior.<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what to do about your wardrobe situation, but the hospital usually puts up family of long term, out of town patients at the local hotel,&quot; explained the doctor. &quot;But then we&#39;re usually talking about just a spouse. If the hospital isn&#39;t willing to cover the expenses of such a big party for so long, I could contact my mother and—&quot;<br />
&quot;Tachibana no Akane has done so much for me, Harry, in fact—all of us already, that I&#39;d hate to intrude upon her generosity again so soon,&quot; complained Jennifer.<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;d be kind of cramp, but I was hoping all of you wouldn&#39;t mind staying with us till all of this is worked out,&quot; revealed Henry Jenkins Senior. &quot;It would give all of us the chance to get to know each other a bit better and besides, this way John and Janice could see what they&#39;d be getting into staying with us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can we?&quot; John and Janice practically begged, in that unique way kids have to attempt to gain something they want.<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind...&quot; began James Junior.<br />
&quot;If I did, I wouldn&#39;t have made the offer to begin with,&quot; pointed out Henry Senior.<br />
&quot;Good. Doctor Tachibana, can you keep that hotel room open for our mother?&quot; asked James Junior.<br />
&quot;Consider it done,&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;Anyone need a ride? The Twist carpool service is available,&quot; offered Samantha, glad that just about everything was coming together to almost everyone&#39;s satisfaction. <i>At least their parents don&#39;t know about weres. I shudder to think what they&#39;d do with that information!</i><br />
&quot;We can hang out for a bit and get everyone settled, but then Jenny and I have other plans for tonight,&quot; announced Harry Jenkins.<br />
&quot;We do?&quot; said Jennifer, looking around.<br />
&quot;Yes honey,&quot; Harry said gently, while taking her hands in his. &quot;While we never planned a formal reception for fear of how things would go with your folks and that Wilhelm creep, despite the fact that we still have school Monday morning, I was hoping we could still go on our honeymoon tonight Mrs. Jenkins.&quot;<br />
That reminded her that not only did they get married that morning, but that she and Harry were still in their gown and tux! &quot;Mrs. Jenkins. I love the sound of that,&quot; said Jennifer with a smile, before hugging her new husband.<br />
Then, still holding Harry close, Jennifer Harper-Jenkins took a look at those around her.<br />
While she knew her parents would never be on her side, she was happy that the rest of her extended family was. <i>Who knows? Once Janice and John are officially emancipated and living in Moon Lake with us, maybe I can talk James and his lady into moving here too,</i> she thought with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
With what was basically an &quot;all clear&quot; signal from Samantha Twist, Mayor Martin Stovall started quietly spreading the word and soon the town of Moon Lake breathed a collective sigh of relief as its citizens resumed their normal Saturday.<br />
Or, at least as normal a Saturday got considering it was Halloween.<br />
Across town, people started prepping for either the trick or treaters, or carrying out tricks and treats themselves, especially members of the Skulk, who looked forward to Halloween almost as much as they looked forward to April Fools&#39; Day.<br />
Part of that preparation also meant getting ready for the annual Halloween dance that night at the local high school.<br />
But to do so, at least one of its potential guests had to go home first.<br />
&quot;Do you know how much I hate leaving you?&quot; Eric Anderson asked his fiance Julie Stovall.<br />
Although the two were just high school Freshmen, being were-mers, they had formed a sacred bond between them, represented by the single pearl necklace Julie wore proudly around her neck.<br />
&quot;I know honey,&quot; she said, holding his hand while leaning against him as they walked back toward his place. The fact that they were both still in their Stage 1 forms, displaying the webbing between their fingers if anyone actually noticed, wasn&#39;t lost on either of them. &quot;Sometimes... the thought of when I&#39;ll see you next is about the only thing that keeps me going,&quot; she confessed.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; admitted Eric, before stopping to stare deeply into Julie&#39;s beautiful blue eyes. &quot;With you, anything and everything seems possible. Truthfully, considering how my life was going back in Minnesota, I honestly thought I&#39;d never find romance, let alone happiness. Now...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know dearest,&quot; said Julie softly, before putting her arms lovingly around her man. &quot;But that&#39;s the past. This is the present, and we&#39;re each other&#39;s future,&quot; she added happily, before gently kissing Eric.<br />
When their lips parted, Eric said &quot;I&#39;ve had more than my fair share of bullies in my life, but I&#39;m glad there was never anyone like that Dieter Wilhelm or Jenny Harper&#39;s father within yours. If I ever lost you...&quot;<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t. Remember, while the Skulk have their life/soul mate bonds; &#39;love at first sight&#39; and &#39;happily forever after&#39; are proven scientific concepts for us were-mers. I fell in love with you the moment I first saw you at school and love you with every beat of my heart.&quot;<br />
The kiss this time was longer and more passionate.<br />
How long their lips would have stayed pressed together, let alone whether that kiss would have progressed to anything else, would forever remain unanswered questions as Eric&#39;s cellphone chimed receipt of an incoming text message.<br />
NEED YOU FOR FINAL COSTUME ADJUSTMENTS BEFORE DANCE.–MOM.<br />
&quot;Gotta go,&quot; said Eric, a bid forlorn as he showed Julie the message.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry beloved. I&#39;ll see you at the dance,&quot; promised Julie, before kissing Eric on the cheek this time.<br />
&quot;Until then, my precious Jewel.&quot; Eric quickly gave Julie a kiss on her check then, clutching his overnight bag, took off the rest of the way back to his place, alone.<br />
Julie stood there until Eric rounded the corner and disappeared from sight.<br />
Turning to walk back to her house, Julie thought, <i>I&#39;m going to have to talk to mom about this sometime. I&#39;m faithfully taking my were-mermaid birth control pill and am a couple of days away from my next period, but if I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d swear Eric and I would go off somewhere and start spawning! Guess my hormones haven&#39;t rebalanced themselves yet from claiming my mate,</i> she figured, knowing it was just a short while back that they had declared their love for each other; let alone when Julie and Eric gave each other their virginity before she ushered him into were society.</p>
