<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You joined the marines?&quot; Your mother and brother looked at you, terrified for your life. &quot;I had always wanted to do some good in my life, and stopping those terrorist that are killing innocent people deserve to burn in hell!&quot; Adam says &quot;The paperwork is already signed. I leave for boot camp tomorrow.&quot; Adams mother looks at him with deep sadness, but goes ahead with what you have said. Adam wakes up at six in the morning, along with all the other recruits at meet them at the bus stop. His mothers words echoed in his mind. Could she really see what I could see when I needed her?<br />
<br />
Boot camp was hard for Adam, but what he didn&#39;t know, with each push up he did and every army drill instructor that got up in his face, he was still building up all of that courage and determination. <br />
<br />
At the end of Adams boot camp experience, he was put where he had wanted to be, battling ISIS. Adam found his commanding officer, Lt. James, and reported for duty. &quot;So you are my new staff Sargent, are you Adam? Well pleased to meet you. I&#39;m Lt. James, but you will refer to me as Sir. Anyway, since you are second In command, I will need you to review with me what happens to you if I ever get wounded too badly to command. Here is your- James didn&#39;t get any further when an explosion rocked the ground. He yelled through the radio &quot;Was that one of ours? What do you mean artillery, well fire back, well who&#39;s in charge then? What do you mean I am?&quot; More frantic messages and then static came through the radio. Adam saw James grab his rife, and Adam followed him to the ditch, where several soldiers were defending from ISIS extremist. You did your best to hold them, and it worked as James flagged the all clear. Lt. James looked at Adam, and said &quot;Rough first day huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
It went on for weeks, the sweat and heat, even when there was nothing to do there was something to do, Adam was always working. Lt. James and Adam became great friends. The courage was building up in him now, he knew something was there, Adam did, but he didn&#39;t know what that feeling was. He felt like whatever it was it was going to build up to a tipping point, whatever that would do to him. <br />
<br />
Lt. James looked at you one day, and said with a depressed, saddened face, that you and him were going to Kligrach. Adam looked at him and said &quot;Your kidding me, right?&quot; &quot;No helicopter is picking us up in twenty&quot; Kligrach, nicknamed Killgrach, was the most dangerous base to be stationed at. Even though it was a huge base, it was covered in craters from the constant barrage of fire. It was always under attack. The luckiest thing that you will ever get coming out of Kligrach is coming out alive. <br />
****************************************************** <br />
<br />
Kligrach was already under mortar fire as the helicopter landed and James/Adam were sent to the trench immediately. They dropped on the sandy trench where they quickly picked up their gear and started firing your rifle<br />
<br />
Ten weeks in the horrible conditions were eased as a dust storm blew over, leaving the enemy command tent unable to command it&#39;s ISIS troops. It was the first time he had food in days, and he ate the rations quick. It felt like three minutes had gone by, as the dust storm cleared and the bombs started dropping again. <br />
<br />
Another four months at Kligrach, he felt the courage everywhere. Like he could go out into those ISIS lines and kill every last one of them. On that fateful day of August 21st, Adam and James were ordered to go out in front of the lines and find a gunner who had strayed too far from the base. As Adam walks out of the safe trench, his helmet on, he cursed Kligrach under his breath. Why me? Why do I have to go out of the trench for someone that was probably dead anyway? &quot;James, I think that&#39;s him, right there!&quot; It was him, and he was still breathing. He didn&#39;t look that bad, and he seemed to have bandaged his wound really well. You dragged him back to the lines, when a loud pop and James&#39;s grunt of pain. Someone from the lines yelled &quot;The Lieutenant is down!&quot; The ISIS assault had begun. <br />
<br />
Adam threw down the young gunner in his hands, and went back for James. He screamed out loud in pain, as a bullet went right into his shoulder and out the other side. Adam picked up James, just as he did, he felt something happy and warm, going back to the days of your childhood. &quot;I am here, Adam&quot; he hears his mother say. He picked up James and screamed his name as he ran for the trench, as another bullet went through your leg. The soldiers from the front lines had got out and formed a circle around you as you dragged James back to the trench. Adam didn&#39;t care about his wounds, even when the medic came, you waved him off and told him to look after James. Then you called over Chav, the radio man, and called HQ, and informed them you were in charge of James&#39;s unit and the situation. After the call, Chav looked at you and says &quot;You really need to get checked by the medic. You have two large bullet wounds in your body and that is something to be concerned about.&quot; Adam says, &quot;I&#39;m fine, go back to the line&quot; <br />
<br />
The next day, he got his bullets removed and he was sent to the lines again. Adams anger had been slowly building up all the time he had been here. The very next day he could take it no longer. Sweat beaded down his neck as he picked up his radio. &quot;Commander, I&#39;m asking you if i could have permission to lead my platoon to liberate Kligrach. His commander sighed. He gave the go ahead as he heard Adams plan. &quot;Fix bayonets!&quot; Adam ordered as he got a splitting headache again. His mother was there. Then his head felt like it was going to burst as every member of his families pack was there, watching his every move as he drew strength from them. His bayonet was hooked on solid, as he pushed himself over the trench with a bloodcurdling scream. Adams line of soldiers followed, as every round found its mark. &quot;We are going to win this fight, come on move your asses!&quot; Adam screamed as the command post was visible. The commander had sent in air vac bombs, as you were still running, many of Adams company right behind him. The ISIS commander was in range. Adam raised his rifle and shot him, just as the bombs fell on the command post. At that, you fell to your knees, and passed out.<br />
<br />
Adam woke up in a hospital, confused why he was not at Kligrach. Then you remembered the bullet wounds. Adam was in the UAE army hospital. &quot;Your awake&quot; said the nurse &quot;Your mother has been notified of your current situation. Also, the president&#39;s ambassador is here to meet you.&quot; At that you were confused. What did the president want from you? As Adam was pondering these questions, James walked in on a crutch. &quot;James, how are you buddy!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m fine, how about you? I heard of your heroic deed of liberating Kligrach from its siege. In fact, they are naming it Fort Adam in your honor dude. The soldiers look up to you as a hero!&quot; James walked out of the room again, just as a lady walked in on a telephone. &quot;Yes, yes, I will handle it. It&#39;s for you Adam&quot; you pick up the telephone and almost cry when you hear your mothers voice. &quot;We saw the entire thing before we saw your eyes close. Nate was in tears, he thought you died&quot; you take a moment to process this. &quot;Can you put Nate on?&quot; You say. There was a muffled silence as Nate picked up the phone &quot;I almost cried when I heard you were ok! What happened?&quot; Adam told him of the events prior to Fort Adam. &quot;They named a fort after you? Cool.&quot; <br />
You said goodbye just as the ambassador walks in. &quot;The president himself wanted to award you this, and he also congratulates you for stopping the siege of Fort Adam.&quot; He puts a Medal of Honor around your neck. You look at it, gaping, as he walks out of the room. You don&#39;t realize it, but all the courage is still inside you, more now, after Fort Adam. <br />
<br />
The cargo-bay doors of the transport plane open, and James grinned at you. &quot;Can&#39;t wait to see my family! You?&quot; You nod. As the landing doors hit the Tarmac with a thud. You walk, the first time you have ever felt the cold air in a while. Adam looks at his mothers pack, and they notice the Medal of Honor. Then you notice the president. He shakes your hand wordlessly, and motions to Adams family. Adam walks, slowly and Nate was the first one to run up to him. Adam stretched open his arms and squeezed Nate. Then Adam&#39;s mother, then the doctor. Then the rest of the pack. You were home.</p>
