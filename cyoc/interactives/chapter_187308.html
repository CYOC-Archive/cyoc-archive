<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brendon had to get away from people. After all, he wasn’t their kind anymore. Distantly, he realized to increasing confusion that he was perfectly fine with becoming this new form. The dinosaur was strong, lean, powerful, and able to take charge where the weak and somewhat outcast human could never have. He felt… sexy? The raptor blinked and realized that something was stirring down below. He glanced behind his tail and saw a distinctively male bulge growing, pushing a little hint of a red tip forward from his sheath. Whoa! Wait! Did he feel… two? Did he have two dicks?<br />
<br />
Worthy of exploration later, he realized, but this wasn’t the time. The red of his dick shrank back in as he lost arousal and glanced around. A small crowd had formed around him. He let out a screech, causing several people to back away in terror, and broke into another run. Murmurs of disbelief trailed him. Phones flashed out of pockets. People were taking videos. Calls were being made to police. Shit!<br />
<br />
He wondered how much energy he had now as he furiously pumped his legs forward. He whizzed past people and their dogs, kids, and cyclists as he followed the familiar path through the park. He didn’t even feel like this was exertion as he ran on an adrenaline high. The thought of his long strong legs turned him on a little. Those perfect handsome muscles propelling him forward. <br />
<br />
Hmm… that new thinking was going to be a problem. He had definitely become more sexual. Sexual. Sex. Masturbation. Pleasure. Orgasm. Release. Cum. His cocks were bobbing and rubbing in his sheath. Holy shit, there we definitely two now! They were rubbing together. No, no, no! Focus!<br />
<br />
He knew where he was going. He needed to get to his girlfriend and her family. She’d keep him safe. That was across town, though! He couldn’t hide very well in the city, could he?<br />
<br />
Eventually, Brendon hit the edge of the park and a cluster of trees and brush he could lay low in and catch his breath. He vaguely heard sirens in the distance and wondered if they were meant for him. No matter, his lithe saurian body was barely tired. Still…<br />
<br />
The teen turned dinosaur hopped into the bushes and let himself finally calm down. The post-transformation terror had given way to a liberating sense of euphoria. Every inch of him was tingling and hot, but he wasn’t cooling down. Of course not, he realized, I can’t sweat anymore. He panted gently and that helped, but what he really needed was cool water to lap with his tongue. His tongue. That long rough tongue. Could he reach with it? Thoughts of a dog licking its own dick filled his head. Hmmm… I wonder.<br />
<br />
Dirty thoughts began to wander through his now half primordial transformed brain again and he giggled. The dinosaur he now shared his mind and body with was a horny beast. That new side of him, all the wonderful instincts, the resilience, the strong confident predator… that predator wanted some sexual release from the human. Please us, the thought bubbled up. Make us feel good.<br />
<br />
But Brendon stayed very still for almost an hour. He wondered what was going on out there, were they looking for him? It struck him that maybe nobody had taken reports of a dinosaur seriously. Maybe they had thought it was a joke. Or perhaps a stunt. Either way, he sat there in the bushes growing more and more confident that nobody was looking for him.<br />
<br />
He even heard people walking by blissfully unaware of the deinonychus lying several feet away camouflaged. He giggled silently. Imagine, walking by a sentient dinosaur hiding in the grass. Speaking of camouflage, Brendon admired the greens and teals of his feathers. He blended in nearly perfectly with the brush. That too, turned him on. Apparently his predator side found it satisfying to be good at concealment. Again, the thought… come on, friend, please us.<br />
<br />
Eventually, things reached a logical conclusion. He was, after all, still a horny teenage boy in a dinosaur’s body, and that dinosaur was equally if not more horny than the human. It was a strange sensation to feel a separate “self” in his mind. Yet they weren’t split, per say. This new mind was every bit himself… it was Brendon. But another Brendon that been created with all these wonderful new thoughts and feelings. Sort of like having two halves making a whole. A harmonious symbiotic friendship. He wondered if Rick’s machine had fractured his mind somewhat during his change. Maybe.<br />
<br />
He was curious, suddenly aware of his other self and allowing it to rise from the depths of his reptilian brain. He probed the dinosaur self a little and discovered that it… responded. It wanted to teach him how to be a good dinosaur. It didn’t want to take control or harm them. It wanted to keep them safe. Interesting. He tried thinking of questions for his other self. The other self was primitive. Didn’t understand such high level concepts. Was confused. But it certainly could offer input if Brendon wanted. He let the other self explain how they worked now and what they needed. Food, water, affection, sex, and comfort. In that order. Again, symbiotic. These surreal moments of inner conversation happened quietly and in seconds. Brendon tried to suppress the other mind and found that it happily faded back into his subconscious if he found it troublesome, but at the cost of his saurian agility and primal instinct. When suppressed, his human mind was little more than a human in dinosaur drag.<br />
<br />
- [ ] The entire experience was quite comforting and positive. He knew that this other self was regulating the human side’s total unfamiliarity with its own body. Which eventually lead back to the matter at hand. As the dinosaur laid there in the late afternoon, he began to experiment with his new body. It wasn’t long before he discovered that he had certain sensitivities that were erotic. One thing lead to another.<br />
<br />
As a human, he would stroke his inner thighs when masturbating and knew that turned him on. As a dinosaur, he had several sensitive areas. Under his chin and down his neck was one. He rubbed his snout against his neck and found it pleasing. The dinosaur mind loved this, and so the human liked it too. He felt himself stirring a little in his sheath. It started to feel warm and tingly. He ran his smooth hand claws through his front feathers, tracing the contour of his tight chest. With a little movement he found he could touch and rub his tight belly. So lean. So strong. He brushed his claw tips and his fingers over his arms. Found them surprisingly big and muscular for such a lean creature.<br />
<br />
He was starting to get erect. Every sensation was a joy. His sheath bulged again, cocks starting to fill. He felt his tips pushing up into the open air at the front of his scaly sheath and was startled as he looked down. The bright red tips were just pushing out from his opening, but the equipment was so bizarre and alien. Those were his dicks? He blinked at the sight of two weird shapes like scorpion stingers bulging out.<br />
<br />
Well, he wasn’t about to turn human again any time soon. When in Rome…<br />
<br />
The new deinonychus twisted back and found that yes, he could *easily* touch his mouth to his own sheath. This thrilled him more as he felt his scaly lips touch his strangely shaped tips. They responded by growing forward slowly. Eager, excited, Brendon slipped out his long tongue, touched the sandpapery texture to his cock tips, and licked them.<br />
<br />
WHOA! He saw colours. He tasted his own musk. He felt heat. The sensation was incredible. He looked down and realized that a bit of shaft was starting to emerge from the sheath now, wrinkled and having a way to fill up behind the strange ovoid tip. He couldn’t resist another taste. And another. And another. Soon he was lapping at his own dick as it emerged. One would grow a little bigger, so he’d lick the other to coax it out more. Pretty soon, the handsome dinosaur was sporting two bright red cocks from his sheath.<br />
<br />
He looked over his new manhoods and gaped in awe. He was *huge!* Each shaft started at a swollen round base that tapered some five or six inches to a cocktip that was almost three inches long. It was the bulging thickness of each member, though, that was startling, with natural reptilian ribbing running down the underside of each member and strange inflated barbs of flesh above. Ticklers! He kept licking and was surprised to learn that wasn’t even fully sized. He could go bigger as he kept stimulating and teasing himself to full, the tips flaring wider and fuller the harder the shafts became.<br />
<br />
Jesus, what an embarrassment of riches this new body was! Thanks Rick! Brendon stood up from his hiding spot sporting his two big dino dicks and watched them throb excitedly as pressure continued to build. He was quite a male now! And, he realized, at only 16 as a human he was probably going to grow even bigger as a dinosaur. His dino side offered that he would grow slowly and continuously his entire life even after he reached his adult size, so it was important for them to stay healthy and well fed to keep getting bigger and stronger.<br />
<br />
That was enough to drive him nuts. The teen dinosaur laid back down in the grass and shoved one of his members down his long jaws, gagging a little and making wet gulping sounds as he eagerly sucked off his own dick. As he felt orgasm nearing, he drew back and was shocked to see that the pulsating member was now visibly fuller and more swollen than the other, a bright red, and about to pop off. Trembling, he decided to finish the job. It only took a few licks to send himself tumbling over the edge. He caught his first load as a dinosaur in his mouth and gargled it, panting desperately as he exploded with hot delicious spunk.<br />
<br />
Jesus! He tasted delicious! He eagerly gulped his own cream down without an afterthought. As the intense orgasm faded he found one dick dripping and shrinking with satisfaction while the other remained hard and ready. No way! He slurped the drops of cum off his lips and eagerly went to town on the other dick. By the time he had drained that one off into his waiting maw the other had shrunk back into his sheath. He couldn’t *wait* to try out these monsters with a girl! What a big, sexy, virile young dinosaur he was! Oh, the scent! He was surrounded by his scent!<br />
<br />
A little dizzy, he let himself calm down and smacked his jaws at the rich pleasing salty flavour permeating his tastebuds.<br />
<br />
So, anyway… his bestial need released, the new dinosaur considered his next move.</p>
