<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff added magic to the setting and started the program with a 1 month duration, only he would be aware of what their life used to be like, he set the plot to be random knowing he could add to it later, the interface changed and Jeff started to remember being taught about magic&#39;s discovery roughly 7 decades ago. <br />
<br />
Most magic is strictly regulated, and some is outright banned however the magic approved for everyone is widespread and finds itself intertwined with everyday objects. Sponges enchanted to remove food debris, makeup enchanted to flawlessly apply itself, floors which over time scuttle dust to one spot on the floor.<br />
<br />
Regulated magics are used in demolitions, healthcare, farming, and countless other fields. The knowledge to perform the spells were encoded such that specializing into a spell field requires special training to read the spell texts and would only enable the wielder to learn a tiny handful of closely related spells at a time. Sharing these secrets are forbidden.<br />
<br />
Magical items as tools, as mentioned, are much more common than the knowledge of how to do magic oneself. Items can be enchanted, but there are also potions, runes, scrolls, and tome&#39;s which exist in this new world. The government, or should I say, each government, has taken similar precautions and has a special wing dedicated to researching the creation of new spells and enchantments, and a separate division to find novel applications for them.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled back from his computer marveling at his new memories, instead of a light switch there was a sigil painted on the wall, a light sigil, causing the ceiling to glow when touched. It was at that moment Jeff&#39;s dad knocked on his door, &quot;Jeff! you haven&#39;t completed your weekly chores and guests are going to arrive in just a few hours! Get with the program, Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On it dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad was hosting a relaxed weekend gathering for the team he was on at work, over the week chores had been added to his list and summarily put off... it was now crunch time and... the pair broke into a back and forth musical montage. Jeff sang about how unfair it was that he is obligated to give up half his weekend to prepare for, entertain, and clean up after dad&#39;s guests, his father sang about how immature Jeff is and picked apart his lifestyle, apathy, and procrastination. When the song was done, Jeff was in the garage pulling out the garbage bins and his father was out back sweeping debris off the porch. <br />
<br />
Time passed, chores were completed (mostly), and guests arrived. After 20 people showed up Jeff remembered he was not extraverted by nature and once another 20 arrived the fact that the party had spilled from the patio to the kitchen, living room, and was threatening to encroach down the hall to his bedroom made the entire house and outside feel stifling. Thus Jeff found himself playing games in the garage on the magic based equivalent of a cell phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, excuse me, mind if I come in? It&#39;s too easy to talk shop and I just want to get away from work for a few minutes.&quot; It was his father&#39;s boss, the company owner. He was a rotund man in his early 50&#39;s with a jovial nature, wielding a cigar and a beer.<br />
&quot;Uhh.&quot; Jeff was caught off guard by the man&#39;s arrival. &quot;I know the feeling, come in.&quot; he wasn&#39;t looking for company but a dealing with a single person isn&#39;t nearly as overwhelming as having his house and backyard overrun with strange people.<br />
<br />
Jeff was between rounds in his game and unsure if he was supposed to engage the man or let him smoke his cigar and drink his beer in silence. &quot;So, you&#39;re my dad&#39;s boss, right? You tell him what to do and he has to listen to you?&quot;<br />
The man let out a chuckle, &quot;Yeah that&#39;s sorta how it works.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How I yearn to not be at my parent&#39;s beck and call.&quot; Jeff commented as an aside, unknowingly sparking another musical montage between him and his dad&#39;s boss.<br />
<br />
The song was a big reveal, throughout it this man offered up a reality altering spell to make a potion promising Jeff &quot;experience. wealth. and power yes I [boss] have enough of it to spare, but what was sacrificed to get it was an heir.&quot; Jeff&#39;s portion of the song revealed, better than he could elucidate himself, his feelings of being stifled and unable to be himself. &quot;My space is not my own, it falls under my dad&#39;s throne, I own things at the whim of my parents! Back and forth to school, to follow everyone&#39;s rules, I can&#39;t go shopping without consent of my parents!&quot; <br />
<br />
The conversation picked up as though they weren&#39;t belting out lyrics and dancing a second ago. &quot;So if you agree to drink it, I&#39;ll cast the spell to make the potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody will notice as things change? But my parents will respect me and not be able to dictate every aspect of my life?&quot; Jeff asked, recognizing this as a plot hook and loving every second of it. &quot;But why don&#39;t you just cast the spell and drink it yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man began a song to explain, &quot;I&#39;ve no desire or constitution to make a victim, my spell makes a potion to average both our lives. I&#39;ll give up half of all I&#39;ve earned across my lifetime. I&#39;ll gain half of all you&#39;ve earned across yours.&quot; The song went on, coming out as a somewhat desperate plea, clarifying that this potion would make him equal to his dad&#39;s boss in position, and implying that by Jeff drinking the potion, Jeff would become the man&#39;s heir which the man desperately wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it, I&#39;ll drink the potion.&quot; Jeff blurted out after the man stopped singing and moving around. After all, switching familial ties wouldn&#39;t be the worst, he&#39;d be set to inherit a company and despite everything he could look after his dad when he takes a position in, or takes over, the company.<br />
<br />
The man paused, processing what Jeff said, left for a moment returning with two beers. He set one down and with a flourish, and dramatic disposition he quietly mumbled some nonsensical arcane words and focused intently on the remaining beer bottle. A few seconds later he removed the cap and handed it to Jeff before doing the same to the other and offering, &quot;Cheers!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m underage!&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;re doing reality altering magic, a scolding from your father for drinking a beer during a party is nothing to be concerned about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff cautiously took a sip but the magic of the potion forced him to drink it all in one go, releasing a tremendous belch a few seconds later. &quot;Is this it? Am I respected by my dad now?&quot; Jeff asked making for the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, woah, woah! Young fella, the potion takes time to do its business, you just drank it! It&#39;ll take a week or two until it is done, so wait a few more days to have your fun. Each day you will see changes did occur, there&#39;ll come a day your father calls you &#39;sir&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated expecting a song but one didn&#39;t come... &quot;Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go about your life and stay out of trouble, when you&#39;re ready come to me for a job. Things will fall into place for you, your future will be blessed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man left the garage, Jeff went about his business after disposing of the evidence that he drank one of his father&#39;s beers... Once the party died down several hours later Jeff was put on clean up duty which lasted into the evening. When things were finally in a state he could leave it at overnight without getting yelled at, he went to his room and collapsed on his bed. After relaxing for a moment he stepped over to the computer and glanced at the story details, having forgotten about it till now... there were now more lines beyond &quot;Setting: Magical&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff peered on to see &quot;Style: Musical&quot; had appeared and he removed that going forward... There was also a listing &quot;Plot Point: Devil&#39;s Bargain-Accepted&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fucking ominous.&quot; Jeff muttered, too tired to care, and unsure of where to even begin trying to figure out how it will backfire, he simply went to bed.</p>
