<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After hearing Dr. Marcoh state the next step in Jeff's process in becoming a permanent fixture on a farm somewhere in the middle of nowhere as a useless, smelly animal, Jeff began frantically pawing the ground, trying to spell out the word &quot;Help!&quot; He was going to spell out the word &quot;stop,&quot; but with his now useless and clumsy donkey hooves, forming the &quot;S&quot; would be incredibly difficult. If not, impossible.<br />
<br />
However, the absent-minded, and slightly evil Dr. Marcoh had something completely different in mind. Knowing that some people tend to change their minds about their transformations, he created various objects that could become permanent fixtures on the transformee, that would make it impossible to use any chronivac to bring them back to normal. For those who became of the equine persuasion, that object was a very special type of horseshoe. These horseshoes were meant to be nailed and glued to the bottoms of equine hooves that were never meant to come off. The glue acting as the permanent agent. <br />
<br />
The reason for the &quot;special&quot; horseshoes (or in the case of young Jeffrey Barrone,) was because with equines, it is not possible to transform anything into anything else, so long as they are wearing such shoes on their hooves. The &quot;special&quot; ones were to keep them in place forever, in the event they were somehow able to communicate that they want to change back. <br />
<br />
As Marcoh began explaining this to Jeff, he hit a button recessed into his workbench. That button operated a hydraulic lift much like what garages have for working on the undersides of cars. The newly crowned donkey that is Jeff, was conveniently standing directly on the lift. Marcoh also knew that Jeff was extremely clumsy, and would probably slip all four of his new donkey legs off the sides, landing on his belly. Also knowing how uncoordinated, and clumsy the kid/donkey was in such a strange body, he knew once Jeff was in that position, he was completely helpless in preventing him from adding those shoes to his largely useless hooves.<br />
<br />
So, Marcoh pressed the button, while explaining to Jeff exactly what he was going to do: permanently place horseshoes on his hooves, so he could enjoy the rest of his shortened life as a jackass donkey without any worries. As the lift began rising, Jeff fell on his underside, with all four hooves sticking out, exactly as he had predicted.<br />
<br />
From Jeff's perspective, he heard what Marcoh was saying. But he was frantically trying to spell out the word &quot;Help&quot; in the ground. He had no idea he was standing on such a lift. Had he known, he probably would have tried running. In his own mind, he was trying to remain calm and hoped to get his point across about wanting to change back into a normal young boy, with an identical twin brother as freshmen in high school.<br />
<br />
Unforturnately for the poor boy (now donkey,) he felt the floor vibrate. As the lift began to rise, he started losing his balance. Unable to stand up, due to the strange changes that he was unused to with this enormous body, all four of his hooves lost contact with the floor as he came crashing down on his underbelly. This knocked the wind out of Jeff, and hurt quite badly, exhaling a loud and obnoxious &quot;HAAAWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Forgetting his loss of speech abilities while trying to regain his breath (not noticing the &quot;hee-haww&quot; noises coming from his mouth as he struggled to regain his breath,) Jeff attempted to say &quot;OW! God that hurt!&quot; All that he could say, once again, was just &quot;HAWW! Hee-Haaww!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcoh came over, and said &quot;Don't worry! I'll see to it that it's impossible to ever become human again! With these specialized horseshoes...errr....donkeyshoes, heh, you'll never be able to turn into a person ever again. You see, I made a failsafe in this invention of mine to keep harm from occurring to any individual if they are wearing something which could harm them as they change. Such as these donkeyshoes. Being nailed and glued to your hooves, they could easily rip your hands and feet apart as you change back into a human boy. We don't want that, now do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Stop! Please!&quot; thought Jeff. Actually, trying to say those words aloud, it came out as a &quot;Haww, Haww, Heee, Hawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simultaneously, Jeff began struggling to get up. But lying down on his stomach with his useless donkey legs dangling over the edges, there wasn't much that he could do. If his front legs were arms, he could easily lift himself off this thing. But alas, his front &quot;arms&quot; were just donkey legs that couldn't move more than 45 degrees in any direction. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the left front leg, Marcoh was able to attach a shoe with glue to that hoof. Feeling a little extra added weight to that leg, Jeff really began panicking once again, realizing his fate of just standing around on all fours in an open field for the rest of his life is about to be sealed. As well as his lack of being ever able to see color again, and only standing there shitting, pissing, and eating. In the same spot. He'll never be able to go and see Europe, or Japan or anyplace else. He'll never be able to play baseball or run track ever again. He'll never be able to see his brother, or his family either, for that matter!<br />
<br />
While all of this was going through Jeff's mind and not paying attention to this mad man, Marcoh attached chains to all four of his ankles. Chains that were hanging from the ceiling. Pulling the chains to where there is no more slack, and to the maximum angle that the donkey's legs could go, Marcoh was able to stop Jeff from swinging his legs around while he went about the delicate business of hammering the nails into the kids/donkey's left hoof.<br />
<br />
&quot;There now. I asked you to stop numerous times! This is probably MOST uncomfortable, but that isn't MY fault! You apparently weren't listening to me as you were trying to jump for joy over your excitement of remaining a donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling he was unable to move his legs any longer, and hearing Marcoh tell him his fate of remaining a donkey, Jeff wanted DESPERATELY to be able to speak! He never wanted to say at least one word in his entire life more than he wanted to say something now! He couldn't see any color. He could barely see anything real clearly more than 5 feet from his eyes, and the most prominent thing he could see was his long ugly snout. Looking over at the mirror, he saw a ridiculous animal on a lift that looked like it was meant for cars, with all four legs sticking up that were attached to chains hanging from the ceiling. He also saw stupid-looking long ears poking up from the sides of its head. And he felt his ridiculously large dick that was getting hard once again underneath his over-sized animal body.<br />
<br />
Then, the pounding started. It started in his left front leg, and reverberated throughout his body. It went with the beat of his heart. Knowing it was now impossible to ever be human, and to see the world in color ever again, and to ever be able to speak in an intelligible fashion; feeling trapped in a nasty body, ashamed, and unable to move, his penis swelled to a disproportionate size. He felt the entire length of his dick getting larger and larger. Trying to mash it down with all of his might, uttering a bunch of &quot;haww.....hawww....hawws..&quot; his penis exploded once again. This time, it was even more powerful than it was the first time! And it lasted longer as well. Much longer!<br />
<br />
Nearly blacking out, and braying a bunch of unintelligent jackass brays from his ugly smelly, slimey mouth, his climax finally began to subside. <br />
<br />
At the same time, Marcoh said &quot;there! It is done! You can now enjoy yourself in this form forever!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff felt the chains around his ankles loosen, then fall away altogether, as his legs dropped back into their normal position below him. The lift began lowering, and for the first time, Jeff did something instinctual: His legs locked into position in order for him to stand on all fours. Had it been 24 hours earlier, he probably would have sunk on his belly all the way to the floor. But he prepared to keep his feet without even thinking about it!<br />
<br />
As his hooves made contact with the floor, it felt different. Before, he could &quot;feel&quot; the floorboards and the unevenness of the ground through his hooves. Now, it felt....different. It felt more stable. And while the ground felt dull and was barely noiceable beneath his hooves, he couldn't feel the ground at all! And he felt a bit taller as well. He felt better somehow. Almost normal.<br />
<br />
Until he looked at the mirror to his right once again, and saw an ugly dirty smelly donkey staring right back, with something sticky and atrociously smelly dripping from his underside. Even Marcoh commented on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, you REALLY must enjoy the idea of remaining a donkey forever! Look at the mess you left for me to clean up! Gawd, that's nasty! It's all....yellow. And there's gallons of it as well. You have it all over your underside, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the mirror with his enormous dick still throbbing, his ears sticking straight up, and his tail hanging to the floor, Jeff has never felt so humiliated in his entire life. Not even his entire donkey life thus far.  Just total, and complete shame made him hang his head. He wanted to retreat to his bedroom, and hide away from the world. But here he is instead. A big dumb old donkey. That is all anyone who ever looks at his body will think: &quot;It's just a stupid donkey,&quot; and move on with their lives. Meanwhile, he will be stuck as that donkey, with nobody ever knowing he was ever part of the human race. Just a donkey. Just a god-damned, stupid jackass gray-furred donkey!</p>
