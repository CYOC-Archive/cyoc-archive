<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was thinking of what to do with Aidan. He could change him however he wanted, and his own fantasy was in high spirits for an idea. Oh, Aidan will hate it, but he will be useful to Mark afterwards.<br />
Aidan didn´t like that grin on Marks face one bit. Whatever he will do, he was sure he himself wouldn´t like it.<br />
<br />
“First I want you to strip out of the rest of your clothes. For my plan I need you naked.” Mark said with a cruel grin. <br />
Aidan turned red in embarrassment for the stripping, but was also shaking in fear. When Mark had already planned out what he would do, that couldn´t be good. His jeans landed on the floor next to his former discarded shirt. Then his body took of his socks, throwing them on top of the shirt. Finally he slipped his underwear down, dropping it on the jeans before he stood still again.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned at the sight, but continued: “So, next I want you to lay down on the floor like a big cross. Then I want your cock to grow into a second head on your body, complete with all that is on your normal head beside the hair. In fact I want you to loose all your body hair, including your head.”<br />
Aidan looked horrified at Mark while he felt his hair falling out. His body again moved alone, laying down next to his discarded clothes in the wished X position. Then he felt his cock-head grow bigger and rounder while the shaft grew wider between the head and his body. It turned into a second neck, while his cock-head grew a nose, ears and eyes out of nowhere. The piss-slit grew wider into a second mouth to finish the head. It was a completely weird feeling for Aidan, and his brain was even more confused when it gained the information from the new senses down there. He could now see from both sets of eyes, smell from both noses and hear from all four ears.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed at Aidans confused look on both faces, finding his changed form really funny. But now he would make Aidan what he needed to be for him. He started to discard his own clothes on the chair by the laptop, stripping naked himself. While he moved over to Aidan, both sets of eyes widened in fear. Mark sat down on Aidans chest, his own cock facing Aidans original head. “Now then, I want you to suck my cock with your mouth while your second head bends forward and cleans my ass with his tongue. Your body will stay unmovable to you, but I can bend you anyway I want. Your bones will work like jelly, so no restrictions for me.”<br />
<br />
Aidans face looked horrified when he moved his head forward on both ends, and started both the sucking and cleaning, letting Mark moan a bit. While Aidan was unmoving beside his mouths work and his eyes, Mark started to move Aidans limbs around. He moved his arms first, bending them so that his elbows were next to his ears. The same he did on the other side, bending Aidans legs so that his knees were next to his second heads ears. He then moved the rest so that his hands could grab his own feet beside Marks body.<br />
Still grinning, Mark continued Aidans changes. “So, now that all is in position, I want your elbows and knees to merge with the ears next to them. You will still be able to hear. Then your hands and feet will also merge together, locking you in place around my body.”<br />
<br />
Aidan looked even more horrified at this comment. He had now a good idea what Mark planned with him and wasn´t pleased with it. But he couldn´t do a thing as his limbs merged together at their ends and also to the side of his heads. He started to cry on both ends, making Mark wet on both sides.<br />
<br />
Marks grin changed a bit because of this. “Oh Aidan, you will stop crying and will be unable to do so from now on. Because you would be a bit heavy and to bulky your body will shrink around my body. All your flesh will turn into soft, blue cloth, turning you into my new boxer shorts. Only your mouths will remain what they are, continuing to suck my cock and clean my ass with your tongue. Your eyes will be painted in the cloth while your noses and teeth sink back into the cloth. You will keep your senses and never accept your new position as my new self-cleaning underwear. You will also drink my piss and cum and eat my shit from now on, it will vanish into your body without anything visible. And you will never like the tastes of this.”<br />
<br />
Aidan mentally screamed at that, the only thing he could still do when his body thinned into cloth. His now painted eyes looked happy, going against his feelings while he still sucked on Marks cock. When Mark finally cummed into his mouth he tasted and absorbed it, continuing the sucking. He also noted how Marks weight grew heavier on his thinner body, putting his body in some pain. He was absolutely helpless.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned down, moaning before he cummed into Aidans mouth. He happily stand up again and moved to the laptop. With Aidan now belonging to him everything Aidan owned before also belonged to him now, not that he would have much use for most things. He deleted his comment from the chronivac, last additions could be made manual if needed. To the world Aidan never existed. He made him indestructible, added that he was unable to go crazy and would grow formfitting to his own body. Mark would only take Aidan off if he wanted sex, and if he slipped Aidan off he would stay as he was until Mark put him on again. Lastly he changed his orientation to add fuel to his embarrassment. He grinned bright as he saw Aidans whole predicament in front of him in the chronivac.<br />

“Yeah, that is all for now. I have made you a heterosexual so it will even be more bad for you, Aidan. But I must say you are really comfortable to wear.” Mark laughed while Aidan was still mentally screaming and crying.</p>
