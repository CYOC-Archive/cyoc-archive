<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk across the campus was an intriguing one, and one that Rachel had gotten a bit of knowledge on by now. The Covaks had been at Moon Lake for a couple of days before her freshman year at Moon Lake College started, and that included an orientation day where she got the official tour, met with the advisors from the faculty that helped with class assignments and all that. Rachel&#39;s freshman classes were pretty generic and didn&#39;t fit any major, though a lot of that also came from the fact that someone in Moon Lake had pulled some strings when she and her mother made some calls in for the application process, using code words to indicate that she&#39;d been raped by a werecat in Florida. Or maybe the bouncer that had rescued her had also sent word and Moon Lake had done a lot to help Rachel get into the college. That was enough for her to get in and get accepted. Rachel could accept that.<br />
<br />
And the campus was an interesting mix. Its administration building was old, and predominantly made of stones that were cut and carved to serve like bricks and even had an architectural feel that looked like it went back to the late 1800s. A couple of the dormitory buildings, like the one where Cynthia often served as an RA in were made of brick and looked like they were built somewhere between the early 1900s and the 1960s. One or two of the other buildings might fit in that area, but many of them also looked like they had more modern bits of architecture to them, and that also included some of the newer dormitory buildings. When Rachel had been given the tour, by Cynthia, she&#39;d been able to get a decent look at this and figured that much of the campus either saw periodic efforts to maintain the buildings in question or build whole new ones to keep the college functional and active. And since things seemed to work, she had no reason to complain.<br />
<br />
The most compelling thing was the green of the campus, from the grass to the various trees that were planted there. It all served to show on how much Moon Lake seemed to want to commune with nature in a way. Some of that made sense given the town’s were population. A werelion or weretiger would need cover to stalk prey and couldn’t just run through the urban jungle. Other weres probably needed the same… though as she walked with Cynthia now, that left her a bit curious on how werehorses and werecattle handled things, as she thought they would prefer a more plains environment to the mountain forests that surrounded Moon Lake. <br />
<br />
Though, for the moment, Rachel kept her focus more on the present discussion with Cynthia and the plans that were there to help Rachel. That had brought the discussion of the various werecat prides and the one that Rachel might have the most contact with while attending Moon Lake College, Delta Phi. As she got better with accepting her own existence as a werecat, meeting with these prides sounded better, and Delta Phi was the more immediate source of help. As Rachel and Cynthia walked along, there was also the consideration that Rachel wouldn&#39;t necessarily be tied to just Delta Phi if she just wanted to join another pride later when she graduated college. And a part of Rachel&#39;s mind was also dwelling on certain things, like the memory of Cynthia being slightly aroused around her the previous night, making Rachel wonder if Cynthia might be into her... but for the moment, Rachel didn&#39;t have the bravery to speak up on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... we&#39;d still have the need to meet with the leader of Delta Phi,&quot; Rachel began slowly as they approached one of the more modern buildings, the Arts and Humanities building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but I got an English class to get to, and your schedule goes a bit later into the day?&quot; Cynthia asked as they paused before the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a late start, but a late finish,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;with my last class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays coming about a couple hours before the start of when the D&D games on Mondays. It&#39;s my Tuesday and Thursday classes that can allow me to get out around the same time that my sisters would get out of school at the high school. It&#39;ll probably complicate some parts of my schedule to meet with the therapist who could help... but... well, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s all understandable,&quot; Cynthia nodded, &quot;I can make a couple of calls and see about setting up a meeting for some time tomorrow. I&#39;ll do what I can to let you know how that turns out... but I got to get to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t talk anymore?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could,&quot; Cynthia responded and then opened the door to the building, &quot;I&#39;ll see about returning your sisters&#39; clothes tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Cynthia then went into the building and left Rachel just standing there before the doors. She stood there for a moment, though, she soon found herself having to move to a side and allowing the others that had class to get to go in. A part of her wanted to chase after Cynthia, and that was the same part of her noted some of the signs of Cynthia&#39;s possible attraction to her and her own attraction to Cynthia as well. However, she also recognized that she was still had classes to attend and as did Cynthia. The only difference between them on the day was that Cynthia&#39;s first class started at nine, which was only about five minutes away now, while Rachel had until 11 before she had her first class of the day. She had about two hours before her class started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d best get out of the way,&quot; Rachel figured to herself and then moved away from the door and began to head along the sidewalk toward the Commons Building, where the student mailboxes were. The Covaks were new to Moon Lake, but every student at the college did get some mail at the campus, often school related, but mail, nonetheless. Rachel made her way there with the intent to see if there was any mail, and to then find a spot out of the way to wait until her first class started. She figured she might end up just going to the college&#39;s library and see what they had there. As for the moment, she had time to kill before her first class.</p>
