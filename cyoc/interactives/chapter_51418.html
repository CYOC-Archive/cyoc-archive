<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want to go to Chendem's,&quot; you said. &quot;I feel like a bit of everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chendem's it is then,&quot; Megan said smiling.<br />
<br />
It was understandable that the three of them were a little nervous going out. They kept looking around expecting another attack. Silverstreak had said whoever it was that attacked had portaled away before they got there. Probably didn't even stay to see if their attack was successful. Fortunately nothing happened on the way to the restaurant.<br />
<br />
Once inside they got their drinks and were seated. This restaurant was set-up buffet style. They tended to have a bit of almost every type of food. Once you had your food Dorcas came to the table and sat down with you saying, &quot;I'm off for the evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can join us for a celebratory dinner then Dorcas,&quot; you said smiling. &quot;Megan and I are going to get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dorcas squealed and said, &quot;Congratulations you two.&quot; Noticing that you had winced and held your head she asked, &quot;Are you alright sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a headache,&quot; you said. &quot;You know my luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were attacked?&quot; Dorcas asked in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;And survived thanks to Megan,&quot; you said in just as low a voice. Didn't need mortals overhearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thanks for saving my sister Megan,&quot; Dorcas said. &quot;I don't know what I'd do if I lost her with our father dying a couple years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed and said, &quot;You'd end up in prison again most likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dorcas frowned and said, &quot;I was a little girl at that time. Mom had said to be proud of who we are. So when they asked I bragged about my familiar. I didn't know I would be spending months in prison or that it might help to get Mom hung.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; you sighed rubbing your head. Your headache was getting worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you're ok sis?&quot; Dorcas asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I'll be fine,&quot; you said before the pain spiked.<br />
<br />
You were back in sixteen ninety-two. You were standing before the two men who had questioned you about being a witch. Something was different though. &quot;So you are saying that you had no idea your sister and mother were practicing witchcraft?&quot; one of them asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir,&quot; you said making yourself sound as meek and innocent as you could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother has told us that she was starting to indoctrinate you into witchcraft,&quot; the other said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not know why she would say that as she has not taught me witchcraft sir,&quot; you said starting to get nervous. They hadn't said that before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is your name in this book then?&quot; the first one asked showing you a book.<br />
<br />
Your name was in the book but you looked at it confused and said, &quot;I am sorry sir but I do not know how to read nor write.&quot; You hoped they would believe that. &quot;Could you please tell me what this book is and what is written in it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother dropped it when we arrested her,&quot; the first man said. &quot;This book contains the names of several practitioners of witchcraft. Each name is written in blood. Even your familiar is listed in here. Do you wish to confess?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was bad. Your mother never had a book like this and you didn't have a familiar. &quot;I have nothing to confess to sir,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You maintain your innocence then?&quot; the second man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do sir,&quot; you said hoping this would be over soon and you would be let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister told us your familiar suckled from your bosom,&quot; the first said. &quot;Remove your dress so we may see if you are innocent or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
You knew you had nothing to fear so you removed your dress and let them examine your chest. They took a long time and then conferred with each other in low tones. You couldn't make out what they were saying but they continued to steal glances at you. It didn't make you feel very confident about your chances of being let go. The two men nodded then grabbed you. They dragged you to the jail and tossed you into a cell. A few minutes later they tossed you dress in with you.<br />
<br />
You lost track of time but you were taken out to witness your mother's hanging. Dorcas was beside you for this and one of the men that had hold of you said, &quot;This is your fate witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple months later, at least you think it was a couple months later, you were taken out again. This time it was to witness your sister's hanging. You knew that something was very wrong here as your sister wasn't hanged in either of the timelines you remembered. Since that day you had been scared that you would be next to hang. You had considered using what magic you knew to try and escape but if you should fail that would just show you were a witch and your mother had told you not to show mortals you were a witch. But you didn't want to die. Finally they opened your cell and you thought this was it. You were going to be hanged. Instead you found that you had been pardoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok miss?&quot; a woman asked. &quot;I think you should get her to a hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you're right,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Come on Liz lets get you checked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked around trying to find Dorcas but didn't see her. &quot;Where's Dorcas?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Megan looked concerned as she gently said, &quot;Liz, you know she died when she was five.&quot;<br />
<br />
That couldn't be. But you have this new memory that said she was hanged in sixteen ninety-two. How could that be though?</p>
