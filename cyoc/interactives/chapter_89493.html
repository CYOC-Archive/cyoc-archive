<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      Slowly he began to open his eyes, groaning softly and his head feeling light and foggy. His memory was almost nonexistent and blurry. And the same could be said for his vision. He was a young man in his late twenties with a fit, athletic figure, light brown hair and blue eyes. His name was Ezra and he groaned as he began to prop himself up, a hand moving to his forehead. his mind seemed to throb like a mild hangover, though the feeling was fading. Soon he ran his fingers through his hair as his memory was steadily recalled and his vision cleared. It was then he remembered something, it was vague, but a memory non the less. Ezra remembered that something bad had happened to him. Or not just something, but a bunch of things. Then it became clearer, Ezra had lost his job. The dick of an employer canned him for no reason. As the memory unfolded in his mind and he recalled the previous events it played out like one of those stereotype &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot; situations. He lost his job, his girlfriend, and his home. He lived off of his savings for a time while looking for work, but to no avail. Then Ezra recalled reaching a point where he almost didn&#39;t care. With only a few hundred dollars left in his jeans he found himself invited to a very obscure club. By who he couldn&#39;t remember. <br />
<br />
His memory recovered further as what happened flashed through his mind. It was a gambling club and although Ezra was not one to gamble, it was his only chance to make some money. And he did! for a while, making several thousand and nearly ten thousand at one point! But then she.... she came into the picture. This woman saw Ezra out of the corner of her eye and sauntered up to him. She was obviously interested in him and not the money and began speaking to him. They sat together and shared a few drinks and talked. The woman was a slender, but very shapely woman. Curves in all the right places and especially in the chest. Ezra was a mild mannered guy and even in the presence of attractive women could always maintain a gentlemanly composure. However he did have a few weakness, and his greatest were large breasts. And by that he didn&#39;t mean the typical double or triple D cup boobs, but into the freakish impractically huge breasts! Deep down Ezra was sexually deviant and fantasized about wild and impossible things. He kept a special diary of his perverse dreams and fantasies. He kept them to himself and honestly didn&#39;t want anyone to know about them for fear of being seen as a sick freak. Though he was very sane and down to earth. But the woman&#39;s chest, it was massive. the woman was dressed in retro Edwardian dress. Something like a throwback to the turn of the century. Ezra tried his best not to gawk and stare at her breasts, but the woman didn&#39;t seem to mind. In fact... she almost encouraged it!<br />
<br />
Despite the awkwardness, Ezra opened up to the woman who actually listened to his tales of misfortune. The woman reassured Ezra and then made a deal with him. That they would play a game of poker. The attractive woman assured him that whether he won or lost that it would be to his benefit. He agreed to with the woman and they played. And for a while, it seemed that Ezra would win the game, but soon enough the tables turned on him. And it was then that everything blacked out and brought it all to the present. That&#39;s when Ezra began to inspect his surroundings. The room he was in and large and dimly lit. The walls were mostly black with red trim, almost like some kind of parlor. The floor was of padded red velvet and he looked around. The room was very large and he couldn&#39;t see the end of it, though that was mostly due to it being dark. It was around this time he noticed he particular situation, he was completely nude and exposed! And he had a leather collar around his neck with a leash leading to a fixed ring on the floor! Ezra began to worry and panic, his breathing deepening and his hear beginning to pound in his chest!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, dear~&quot; then said a seductive, sultry voice from the darkness of the room. As he turned toward the source of the voice he saw a pair of beautiful cat like eyes looking at him! They were a rich violet color and as he looked at them he began to recognize them. they looked like the eyes of the woman he had remembered from the club. In the dim light he strained to see the woman&#39;s silhouette in the shadows. But there was something different about her. There was a subtle purr he could faintly hear and something was slowly swishing back and forth around her legs as she sat and just eyes over Ezra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-Who... Who are you? Wh-What&#39;s going on, why am I hear!?&quot; Ezra then blurted out, his concern for his well being was evident in his voice. The woman seemed to giggle softly and sigh with content, tilting her head to one side. <br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t you remember? This is our end of the deal~!&quot; the woman then said to Ezra. &quot;You lost the game~ And that means.... you are all mine~&quot; The woman then purred with a more ominous demeanor. That was when she stood up and slowly began approaching Ezra. As her leg emerged from the darkness and stepped into the light it was covered in.... fur!? Ezra at first was perplexed and looked on with confusion. But as the woman emerged out of the shadows his jaw soon dropped in disbelief. The woman was feline! More specifically she resembled a snow leopard with cool grey fur dominating the color of her coat with charcoal grey and black markings. A massive fluffy tail that swayed too and fro gently and slowly behind her shapely body. She was clad in a black and purple dress with a skirt that fell to just below her knees. The dress was certainly tailored for a dominatrix and enhanced the look of her already gargantuan breasts! each tit was at least the size of her head if not bigger. Bigger than he remembered when he first saw the woman. From her chin and working down to her chest and belly, concealed by the dress, her fur was white. But there was one other feature that stood out. She had massive fangs protruding from her mouth, identical to that of a saber tooth tiger.<br />
<br />
Ezra couldn&#39;t help but stare at this female before him. A mix of fear, concern, and attraction washed over him all at the same time. But as she came near him he tried to shuffle away, but that leash tethered him to the floor and had nowhere to go. As the female knelt down she placed her hand under Ezra chin and made him look at her eye to eye. &quot;You have such beautiful eyes~&quot; she purred to him. Ezra couldn&#39;t help but feel drawn into those beautiful eyes, the brilliant violet color. Like emeralds looking back at him, but still Ezra was still concerned for his life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-Why? Why am I here? What do you m-mean this is the deal...? And what a-are you...!?&quot; he then asked very nervously. The feline grinned as she still held his chin, her free hand then running over his chest and upper body. <br />
&quot;Well~ To answer you last question, I&#39;m a fur~! This is the real me, Ezra dear! It&#39;s very difficult to hide what I really am. I know you like what you see~ I can hear it and smell it, love. But as to our deal, I promised you that your needs will be met whether you won or lost our little poker game.&quot; she then said and soon continued as Ezra writhed and shifted about trying to avoid her touch. The soft fur and pads of her hands sent shivers up the male&#39;s spine! &quot;Although... I have to confess, I rigged our game. I just had to have you! After what you told me about your life, I knew I could make a better one for you here~ with me~ I&#39;ve actually had my eye on you for SUCH a long time! And after what I read in here~&quot; the feline trailed off and pulled out a small notebook... it was Ezra&#39;s fantasy journal! With wide eyes he jolted and tried to snatch it out of the female&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-Wha... How!? You&#39;ve r-read my journal!!?!&quot; Ezra shouted and tried to push against the feline, only to have her deceptively strong body push back against him. He felt as though she&#39;d knock the wind out of him if she pushed any harder! <br />
&quot;Ah, AH! This is mine now, and so are you~! I know about a particular fantasy and it&#39;s exactly how I knew to change my body. I&#39;m your dream girl, Ezra and you don&#39;t even know it. And soon... you will be my dream mate~&quot; she purred deeply and seductively. She tossed the journal to the edge of the room and before Ezra could muster a response she suddenly pressed her maw against his lips and kissed him with such passion. He himself froze and his eyes went wide! He felt her tongue dancing with his and her moans of desire for him. Feeling her huge, firm chest against his instantly sent a warmth through his body. It had been ages since he had felt any sort of real pleasure and the sudden show of affection began to chip away at his wall of resistance. His generously sized member beginning to twitch and pulse as his arousal slowly began to build. But little did Ezra know that the kiss was mostly a distraction. From the back of her belt she  pulled out a syringe and injected an amber substance into his neck! Ezra instantly jolted and cried out, a hand instantly reaching for the injection site! The feline pulled the needle out and pulled away herself and with a devious grin on her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;And now, for you to become a kitty boi~&quot; she purred as she unlatched the leash and let Ezra free. Or so he though. He instantly fled from her and shuffling till his back was against the wall and stating up. But soon he began to feel warm and began to pant. &quot;Wh-What did you d-do to me!!?&quot; she said with a horse voice, then groaning as he began to feel sick to his stomach. He hunched over and groaned with discomfort before dropping to his knees and, eventually, to all fours. The feline watched as Ezra reeled from the effects of the substance and showed signs of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it hurts... but it won&#39;t last long...&quot; she said as though to comfort Ezra. He looked up to her and saw her watching and then his vision blurred. He clamped his eyes shut and cried out as his stomach felt as though it were being wrenched and ground up in his stomach! As he continued to groan and cry his body began to change. His nose and mouth elongating into a feline maw, his ears changing and shifting to the top of his head. Ezra collapsed onto the padded floor and cried out, his teeth were changing and becoming sharper! A tail soon began to extend from the base of his spine and his body began to become covered in white fur and black stripes! After several minutes Ezra moaned and panted heavily, whimpering in relief that all the discomfort was suddenly gone. The female herself was panting and had a hand buried into her own pussy and was frantically pleasuring herself! &quot;E-Ezra....! Y-You....&quot; she tried to speak as she gawked over his new form. Ezra was now a white tiger, his eyes a brilliant blue color and he still retained his body type, if not a bit more muscular. As he lay on his back an adverse effect of the change was his member. His cock was raging hard and stood up from his groin. Ten inches of male member demanding satisfaction and already drooling with pre. The female then made her way over and using her pussy juice soaked hand began to stroke his shaft, instantly making him gasp and whimper in reluctant pleasure. His still human looking cock throbbing even harder from her touch. As she teased Ezra in his weakened state she leaned in and whisper into his new feline ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you remember, but my name is Rain~ And I will be your Mistress from now on. For the rest of your days I will take care of you, feed you, and be your companion. And I will indulge you in both of out wildest fantasies my new toy~&quot; She purred with such a sultry and seductive tone with her soft voice! Ezra couldn&#39;t help but dig his new claws into the floor, panting and whimpering as she teases him even more! Soon moaning from his need for release. Then Rain continued. &quot;I know you want to cum, but not yet... not for a long time. I still need to make you my personal wet dream made real~ turning you into the tiger you are was only the beginning~!&quot; She then said and purred deeply and panted in anticipation with what she had planned for him next.</p>
