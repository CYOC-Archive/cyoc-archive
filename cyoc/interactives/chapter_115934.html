<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About a month after the Outbreak...<br />
<br />
Rift, as he preferred to be called, was tingling with anticipation. Well, he did his best not to show it. After all, goths weren&#39;t supposed to show excitement. Sometimes the darker image of gothic life got a bit depressing. Well, that was part of the point, but Rift felt like he should have some happiness.<br />
<br />
Jet was the answer to that in a way he couldn&#39;t have imagined. When he befriended the wild raven, he had no idea that she was female. So he wasn&#39;t sure if he was more surprised that she was an anthro or that she was a woman. But he wasn&#39;t willing to reject her just because she didn&#39;t seem immediately after being uplifted. He was pretty impressed that she had been able to earn a very complimenting goth getup just to suit his tastes. The wig she wore was a little much though. While most uplifted Animalians didn&#39;t have the same kind of tresses as humans, Jet didn&#39;t need to wear a wig to make her look better.<br />
<br />
The friendship between Rift and Jet became ever stronger now that she was an Animalian. She had a similar taste for the gothic style and a surprising gift for poetry. While most uplifted didn&#39;t see much point in dressing besides decency, Jet actually enjoyed wearing various outfits, especially if they showed off her hot body. It was pretty obvious that Jet was flirting with Rift. Apparently, Jet didn&#39;t have the patience for long subtly games.<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t bother Rift much because he felt the same way towards Jet. How could he not feel attraction to a beautiful woman who liked many things that he did. So what if she was a raven and technically older than him. All it took was two doses from her and they&#39;d be on equal footing. Of course, that was easier said than done. Well, giving the doses may be easy, but going through the paperwork involving it was a bigger pain. Thankfully, his parents were supportive of him and his life choices. And Jet made a pretty good impression on them, considering she was a humanoid raven.<br />
<br />
And finally, everything was ready. The paperwork was signed, submitted, and approved. All that was left to do was the dosage. And Jet had set up a very special arrangement for that. The curtains were drawn in his room which was only illuminated by the light of several candles. Rift felt a little embarrassed to be sitting on his bed in just his boxers. Jet was giving him plenty of reason to be nervous considering her outfit consisted of just panties and a corset that covered just enough to keep her decent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, can&#39;t you just give me...something to drink?&quot; asked Rift nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no need to be shy,&quot; said Jet as she approached him, &quot;We are to be mates, our souls bound by a pair of wings to take us through the darkest nights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get to be so good with words?&quot; asked Rift.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I just have a special tongue. Let me show you,&quot; said Jet before grasping the back of Rift&#39;s head and pressing her beaks to his lips. Rift thought they were kissing until Jet actually shoved her beak into his mouth. Rift nearly gagged as he felt her tongue feeling deep inside her mouth, namely because she kept brushing his uvula. He didn&#39;t think she&#39;d be kissing him THIS deeply.<br />
<br />
Then Rift felt a tingling through his body. The dark hairs that puberty had put on his body were standing up taller before they started to morph into black quills, more feathers appearing between them. His hands became tougher as the nails grew longer as they became like bird&#39;s feet. His feet actually became bird&#39;s feet, three toes stretching out while another toe appeared on his heel, giving him the ability to grasp with them. Jet withdrew from his mouth as his teeth started fusing together and pushing past his lips. His mouth seemed to be extending out of his face as his fused teeth grew black and pointed. His nose merged with his growing mouth which was obviously becoming a beak. Then Rift felt a tingling between his shoulder blades as two stumpy limbs formed. They quickly became larger as long feathers grew from them.<br />
<br />
Jet sat down on the bed next to Rift, who was now an anthro raven like herself. Like her, his wings grew from his so he wouldn&#39;t have to work on flapping his arms to fly. He still had his human hair, which was as black as his new feathers. She was still a little smaller than Jet, but that can be taken care of.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is what it&#39;s like to have wings,&quot; said Rift as he moved his new appendages.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show how to fly later,&quot; said Jet, &quot;But for now...&quot; She unclipped her corset and allowed it to slide off. She had pretty good breasts for a bird, but the Animalian virus made everyone well-endowed. Her panties slid off before she laid down on the bed. &quot;Now, take a bird&#39;s eye view of my mountains and valley,&quot; purred Jet.<br />
<br />
Rift was quick to pick up on her meaning and pulled off his boxers. His member was more pointed and slimmer than he thought, but it was still longer. He climbed on top of Jet until he was aligned. Carefully, he began to lower. For a moment, he was worried he&#39;d miss but then he felt a wetness and a soft resistance against the tip of his spear. Now that he found her abyss, he took the plunge. Jet gave a quork of pleasure at that. Rift made his own quork as he felt soft kissing pleasure wrap around him. He soon started to move up and down to keep it up.<br />
<br />
As Rift moved, he started changing again. His lanky teenage body was starting to grow larger and thicker. Underdeveloped muscles started becoming defined and enlarging. His shoulders grew wider to better help him stay airborne. The shadow he cast over Jet grew as he blocked out more light. Jet just moaned and cawed in the growing darkness as her pleasure grew. Rift&#39;s caws were becoming deeper as his chest became broader. He could feel the shaft that was entering Jet was growing in size as well, which made it even more pleasurable for them. The two ravens thrust together as things got to the boiling point. Finally, they let out a loud caw as Rift sent his seed deep into his soulmate.<br />
<br />
The two gave soft pants as they recovered. Hovering over Jet now was an adult raven man. He wasn&#39;t nearly as musclebound as some birds like the eagles, but he was definitely strong enough for her. He leaned down to her and said in a deeper voice, &quot;Please don&#39;t ever leave my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jet smiled up at Rift and said, &quot;Nevermore.&quot; Kissing was a little tricky with beaks, but Jet and Rift were quickly to learn and master it.</p>
