<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oooh…” William groaned, immediately falling to the ground in discomfort. Lila was still readjusting to her surroundings, but she could see her old body, still heavily pregnant, getting… pregnanter?<br />
<br />
“William?” She asked, her hand on her head, “are you okay?”<br />
“Y-yeah, I’m fi-iiiooohhh…” William groaned, grabbing at his swelling belly, “somethings different!” He moaned. His belly was growing, slowly but clearly, stretching the dress. Lila watched as it got tighter, he seemed to be gaining weight as well. Not to mention his breasts were swelling too. From big, to huge… and they seemed to be approaching the gigantic threshold,<br />
“Okay… uhm okay…” Lila tried to help, seriously unsure of how to help him, “just lay down, okay… can you make it to the couch?” She asked. William could only groan, his body getting thicker and bigger and heavier. Yet, he tried his best to move.<br />
Lila guided him across the room and finally onto one of the sofa’s. He fell backwards, his body jiggling as much as it could as he did before his dress tore completely open. His bra burst too, revealing his growing breasts, his huge, dark nipples.<br />
<br />
“Why is this happening…” he groaned,<br />
“I don’t know, but just stay here,” Lila said.<br />
<br />
She quickly left the room, running into the kitchen and grabbing anything she could. She didn’t have the power William had, to just make anything appear… if she did she would’ve gotten some sort of elixir to make him feel better. Or feel nothing. Or just be back to normal!<br />
She really wondered what could’ve caused this. It wasn’t anything to do with the wish, and that fairy was nowhere to be seen, neither was Alicia.<br />
Where could they have been… she wished they were here.<br />
<br />
Wait…<br />
No no no…<br />
It couldn’t be.<br />
“Oh shit,” Lila said, realising her terrible mistake.<br />
If she was right, Alicia and the fairy were here, and they were growing inside of William’s belly. <br />
She didn’t know what to do, the only thing she could do… was ask?<br />
<br />
“William!” Lila hurriedly said,<br />
“Uhhhh…” William groaned, looking over,<br />
“It’s them… they’re in your belly,”<br />
“WHAT!” Willaim tried to shout, but only caused more discomfort as his already massive breasts swelled to gigantic, beginning to leak a little,<br />
“You need to calm down… you need to ask them to stop!” She said,<br />
“R-really…”<br />
“I don’t know!” Lila said, “just try,”<br />
“Uhhh…” Willaim groaned, he looked down, “h-hey guys… can you stop making my belly and boobs grow?” He asked somewhat politely.<br />
Immediately his body started rising on the couch, his thighs and butt started getting huge, his hips widening, “AHHH!” He groaned loudly,<br />
<br />
“SERIOUSLY!” Lila shouted, the growing seemed to slow for a moment. Just from that, she had a burst of confidence. She rushed over, pressed her mouth to his belly, “if you two really want to get out, you need to stop messing around with MY old body, and let us wait until tomorrow when we can wish you out of there! GOT IT!?” She finished, sounding very serious.<br />
Shockingly, the growing stopped. William’s discomfort started fading, left only wish a heavy, overinflated body.<br />
<br />
“Th-thank you…” William managed to say, “I just need… I need to…” he started drifting off,<br />
“Wait William! William we need to… plan our wishes for tomorrow…” she gave up, “we’ll do it later. I need a rest too…” Lila said.<br />
<br />
She slouched herself down next to William. She looked over, only now really taking in the fact she was looking at herself.<br />
She had all these new memories, fluctuating between one-another. Memories of her old life, her future life… and strangely some of William’s future life.<br />
There was a lot of masturbation… a lot of it. But there was also some sweeter moments. His attempts at romance, failing miserably. Was he seriously that much of a loser? She considered him a loser in High School, sure… but really thought he’d have grown into his own.<br />
Clearly he hadn’t. He’d let himself go, started having one-night stands, giving up on a career and… dropping out of College.<br />
She always assumed him to be smart. Maybe they weren’t so close, but she knew him better than that.<br />
<br />
She looked over at her old body. Even though it was heavily overblown and swollen, she couldn’t say she hadn’t let herself go a little.<br />
She lied to William. She got knocked up by one of her friends on a random night. Drunk.<br />
As an adult woman, she was pretty hot, and she knew it. She didn’t have huge tits like the other girls, but they were a good size. Modest. She was obviously a rare case, which is why she seemed appealing.<br />
She got pregnant, didn’t tell the guy, and moved to Florida. Hoping to maybe start fresh… then she woke up. Came back to reality and realised she’d been in a trance for almost ten years.<br />
It was odd. All these memories, yet they didn’t feel like hers. They felt like choices, but picked by someone else. Another version of her.<br />
She looked at her body. Her swollen breasts, her big butt, and her massive pregnant belly.<br />
How did she let this happen. After everything… she just got lucky. She never tried, just followed the crowd and seemed to wind up in a good situation.<br />
At least William made his own choices… as misguided as they might be.<br />
<br />
She looked over at him, then looked down at herself. William’s body.<br />
“So this is what it looks like when we’re apart…” she said to herself, “what about if we were together?” She asked, of course, getting no reply from the unconscious William.<br />
<br />
“Welp…” Lila said to herself, looking down at her body, “I’m gonna find out what masturbating with a penis is like!”</p>
