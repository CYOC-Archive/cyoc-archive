<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You're back in your own house.  It's daylight, but something's wrong. You see stuff is wrong. The doorway is <br />
too narrow, and the stove is on the wrong side of the kitchen. But otherwise you know it's your house alright, <br />
just someone else's dream version of it. Someone is seated at your dad's place at the table, but all you can <br />
see is hands holding a newspaper. The hands don't look like your dad's. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning?&quot; you say as you head to your place at the breakfast table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Roxanne,&quot; says your cousin's father lowering his newspaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, what's going on?&quot; you ask uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean where is everybody?  Well, my wife made breakfast and then rushed off to do her hair, she's got <br />
something to do with her women's club later this morning. And since it is a Saturday, I guess my son Richard <br />
decided to sleep in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About my parents?&quot; you ask uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, Roxanne, we told you at the funeral that your parents' will left you well provided, so you can stay <br />
here with us until you're 25,&quot; he said sympathetically.<br />
<br />
Okay, whose dream is this?  Auntie's?  Or Richard's?<br />
<br />
The room shifted. Suddenly, Uncle Joe and Auntie Elaine were next to the door. Joe was dressed in khaki slacks <br />
and bright green polo shirt now and had a golf bag. Auntie Elaine was wearing her Sunday best. They bother <br />
were pretty lovey dovey. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'll drop Elaine off at the Country Club for her Women's group, and play around of golf.  Roxanne, make <br />
sure that Richard eats all his breakfast, and have a good day.  We should be home by 7 or 8 tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they were gone.<br />
<br />
You look down at yourself. You're in a flannel nightgown, but you're still most definitely your old male self.  <br />
Why are they calling you Roxanne. You look at your reflection in the toaster and your own face stares back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Roxy, my morning wood needs attention,&quot; Dick says as he enters wearing your black and grey checked robe. <br />
It's not tied, and hanging open you can see he's wearing your monogrammed boxer shorts that Grandmother gave <br />
you for Christmas. The boxers are tented with his morning erection.<br />
<br />
You open your mouth, but suddenly you're not seated in the chair but on your knees facing it, as Dick <br />
straddles it and sits down.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can this be your nightmare, Dick?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; there's a confused look on his face, &quot;Bro, what are you doing on your knees?  Are you gay or <br />
something?&quot;<br />
<br />
You're no longer dressed in a flannel nightgown, but in little boy pajamas with Spider-Man on them.  You get <br />
up silently, and sit at the other plate of food at the breakfast table.  It is usually Dick's place.  His <br />
dream version is more muscular and confident looking than his real self, and he's got hair on his normally <br />
smooth chest.<br />
<br />
You both eat silently. Then suddenly, you're in the shower. Both of you!  You're naked and lathering each <br />
other up. You step under the torrent of water rinsing off, and say, &quot;I'm done.&quot; Then hastily get out of the <br />
shower leaving Dick alone in the shower.<br />
<br />
Does he have some sort of weird attraction to you or maybe in his nightmare he thinks you have one to him? <br />
What's causing this choppy weird dream? You grab the only towel on the towel bar - it's a hand towel and rush <br />
out of the bathroom to your bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alp!&quot; you shout.<br />
<br />
The door flies open, and naked and dripping Dick stands there. His eyes and teeth sparkle, &quot;What's the matter, <br />
bro? I'm here to help!&quot;<br />
<br />
He freezes in mid stride with his naked dick freezing in mid-flop. Alp is there. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can see why I assigned you to Dick's nightmare. You seem to play a pivotal role,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he gay or does he think he's gay? Or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn't say, but this isn't his dream, anymore than that Snaky dream was yours. An outside source is <br />
creating it. Perhaps because the source thinks Dick is gay or a homophobe or just because the incestuous <br />
nature of the dream would and is freaking him out.  It could be the source of this nightmare is actually <br />
attracted to Dick, and is using you vicariously as Roxanne. You see in Cyrano - Roxanne is wooed by a <br />
surrogate, so you may be the surrogate for the interloper or perhaps your cousin's dream was intended for you. <br />
The source of the interference in my domain is strongest in your house.  Everyone is having nightmares, <br />
perhaps they aren't having the intended ones. Or perhaps someone has placed a dream curse on your whole <br />
household,&quot; Alp rattles on hurriedly, &quot;Since I'm not in control here, I can only pause the dream so long.&quot; You <br />
notice sweat on the child's brow. He trembles from the strain.  He looks around, and continues, &quot;We need <br />
something for you to be rescued from. How about the snake from the other dream?&quot; He waves his hand and it <br />
appears on the bed.  He glances at you and Dick, and waves his hand again. You both are wrapped around the <br />
waist in full-size towels. Then he is gone and Dick continues to stride forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-s-snake!&quot; you say pointing at the bed. <br />
<br />
He stares at you and then at the bed as though this wasn't what he was expecting. Then he grabs the snake by <br />
the tail and swings it like a whip smashing its head against the wall.<br />
<br />
Holding the big lifeless snake in his hand, Dick looks at it, and asks, &quot;Where did he come from?  It looks <br />
just like the snake my buddy had when I was 12, but that thing died 3 or 4 years ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mixed up dreams? <br />
<br />
&quot;What did your friend look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Al?  He was my age and had long straight black hair and green eyes. Oh, and he did the best magic tricks, <br />
even had a tuxedo, cape, top hat and cane,&quot; Dick said as he reminisced. He sighed, &quot;I haven't seen him since <br />
the divorce.  Divorce?&quot; He sounded confused, his parents were at the Country Club, they weren't divorced. Or <br />
were they? He rubbed his head with his free hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No. No.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The words are muffled and seem to be coming from the ceiling or attic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something's interfering - I know!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everything shifted again.<br />
<br />
This time you are wearing black leather shorts with a steel chain belt secured by a padlock and chained to the <br />
pool table in the basement. A tennis ball is jammed in your mouth and secured by a jockstrap gag. This time <br />
Dick is in a black leather harness wearing black leather chaps and a black leather jockstrap. He's staring at <br />
the bullwhip in his hand which had been the dead snake just a moment ago.  You notice his chest hair is gone, <br />
and his muscular body seems more muscular and freshly oiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; he says uncertainly.<br />
<br />
You shout into the tennis ball. The fuzz seems to be coming off on your tongue.</p>
