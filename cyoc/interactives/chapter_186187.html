<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Judy was calm and collected as she made her way to the Animalia Police Station with the syringes that had been requested for Juan Teroz&#39;s conversion. It was a complicated thing, as it had required Horizon to get in contact with some specific pet breeders in order to get what Juan requested in a &quot;Golden Fox.&quot; It made for an interesting choice, and was likely to try and balance with Juliet&#39;s silver coloring, but one that would also kill any sort of breeding between the two if the two became an &quot;item.&quot; Given some of the things that had gone on with Juliet when she and her girls were in Animalia, Judy sort of figured that Juliet might well be looking to have her own family now with her youth restored and Animalian libido sitting there, and as such she could be with any Red Fox Animalian of any of the Red Fox&#39;s various color phases.<br />
<br />
However the &quot;Golden Fox&quot; was not an actual fox species or Red Fox color phase. It was actually a hybrid between the Red Fox, Vulpes Vulpes, and the Artic Fox, Vulpes Lagopus, and specifically the Golden Island Fox. From what Judy had read, this did occasionally happen in the wild, but it was rare, and the pet breading center that had provided the DNA to Horizon also informed her that Golden Fox kits were sterile, as hybrids generally tended to be. Now, the nature of the Animalia Virus would cure that sterility issue, as had been found with their Liger and Mule Animalians, but it wouldn&#39;t remove the fact that Juan would not be a true representative of either Red Fox Animalians or Artic Fox Animalians. As such, if he developed any romantic feelings for Juliet, he could NEVER sire children with her as per Animalia&#39;s Edicts on inter-species breeding. That would also go both ways, in that if while Animalia would accept the romantic bond, it would not accept these attempts at hybridization when it came to breeding. Which was something that Judy had her own worries over with regard to things that had happened with Juliet at the Meat Market. <br />
<br />
Normally, Judy didn&#39;t pay attention to these rumors, but this had the potential to raise worries over that issue. As what had happened had the potential to mirror cases of Regressive Hypersexuality Syndrome or at least a massive psychological shock that had put Juliet to a point where a little extra alcohol was more than enough to get her willing to go beyond that. Juan becoming a Fox Animalian had the potential to trigger those feelings in Juliet and thus Juan had to be informed on how his conversion would also come with its own complications. To an extent, it was likely that Juan already knew this, but Judy had to be sure that Juan did understand this. And since Juan had been brought to Animalia as part of the &quot;Trash Recycling Program,&quot; he had to be held in the jail until he&#39;d made it through the program completely and could be cleared for anything that would come next.<br />
<br />
She was greeted by both a Human officer, who had brought Juan to Animalia and Simon, who by now was old enough to have received his badge and thus was actively able to represent the Animalia PD.<br />
<br />
&quot;You represent Horizon?&quot; the Human officer asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Judy answered with a nod, &quot;I trust that Mr. Teroz is in good condition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As good as a man of his weight can be,&quot; the Human officer answered, &quot;we&#39;re actually hoping this could put him in good health... as he&#39;s been well behaved. It&#39;s nothing that truly deserves being in his condition. It seems odd, given how often law enforcement gets the reputation of not caring, but much of that relates more to people we feel to be career criminals and those that are truly rotten. Mr. Teroz isn&#39;t in that category.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can escort you to him,&quot; Simon added, &quot;Protocol will demand that Officer Yeep be present for the injection, as it was in his jurisdiction that Mr. Teroz was arrested.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Juan was seated quietly on the bench that was provided. While Animalia generally didn&#39;t have to deal with too much more than some traffic violations and a little too much alcohol, that still ended up requiring strong facilities for those Animalians that were bigger and this benefitted Juan&#39;s weight. He looked up to see the door open to reveal the Human officer that had driven him up, and had been remarkable tolerant of him and a largely gray furred Rabbit Animalian, and more based on a wild Cottontail Rabbit species, though Juan didn&#39;t know which. For the moment he didn&#39;t stand as a lot of that was rather tough for him at times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... you&#39;ll mind if I don&#39;t stand up, as that can be a bit tough at times,&quot; Juan spoke up quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is alright,&quot; Judy spoke, &quot;the conversion will help with that. My name is Judy, I work for Horizon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Judy?&quot; Juan asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was uplifted... so yes,&quot; Judy answered, &quot;before we get started... there are some things that we will need to discuss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Namely that Juliet Renard-Argenté is a Red Fox Animalian and that the fox species I&#39;ve chosen, the &quot;Golden Island Foxes&quot; is a hybrid between the Red Fox and the Arctic Fox, and relying on specific color phases of the two species in that breeding...&quot; Juan answered, &quot;Yes, I understand. It would mean that I cannot breed with Madame Renard-Argenté, as per Animalia&#39;s Edicts. But my choice was not about finding a girlfriend or being a boyfriend for Madame Renard-Argenté.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you do understand that,&quot; Judy nodded, &quot;Good. However, the situation may be complicated in that SHE may be dealing with issues that could relate to that... coming from issues that are likely to be embarrassing to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do my best to set things clear that I am NOT seeking romance,&quot; Juan stated clearly, &quot;merely a professional relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that will be important,&quot; Judy said firmly.<br />
<br />
Juan nodded with full recognition of what becoming a &quot;Golden Fox&quot; would mean. As it wasn&#39;t a separate color phase of the Red Fox but the result of selective Human breeding. It was a hybrid and thus the only other Fox Animalian he could really be with was another of that exact same hybrid, unless there was no breeding that was to come from the pairing, and specifically referred to as the Golden Island Fox. With those facts recognized, Judy then nodded and began to ready the syringes for the conversion. It eventually turned to as Judy readied the alcohol swab and then gave Juan his &quot;welcome to Animalia&quot; before delivering the twin injections. The syringe she used had a longer needle than most others, but given Juan&#39;s weight the longer needle was needed. It didn&#39;t hurt and Juan felt no problem with it.<br />
<br />
With the injection, Juan soon felt rather warm after the injection. He looked up to watch as Judy and the Human officer then left the cell. This once again left him alone, but for the moment that was probably a good thing as the warmth heralded the start of the transformation. Parts of it reflected the standard part of a transformation from Human to Animalian, but the biggest part for Juan was in the loss of all the weight he put on. It meant rather profuse sweating, but the more he sweat the more fat was burned away and his physical form shrank down, at least with regard to the excess weight. At times it was also balanced by some of the first more animalistic parts of the change, and this included the lengthening of his feet. He just managed to flick off his shoes to see stubby claws and furless feet stretch out into the same sort of digitigrade legs that he&#39;d seen with of Animalia&#39;s Fox Animalians. The only thing that was different was the fact that for the moment there was no fur on that foot.<br />
<br />
Yet the warmth remained and that had Juan a bit puzzled as he tried to look over his transformation. He would have figured that his transformation would have shown more signs of the transformation beyond sweating and lengthening feet. At about the same time as he ran his tongue over his teeth, he could feel some changes as his canines began to lengthen and his molars sharpened and narrowed. This resulted in the interlocking teeth that all Carnivorans were known for. With it, his face crackled and snapped as his face began to push forward into the pointed vulpine muzzle that all foxes had. His nose was now a black pad at the tip of that muzzle, but there was still no fur and that only served to puzzle Juan a bit. What puzzled him more was the tickling sensation as his enlarging ears brushed through his hair as they moved up onto the top of his head and he seemed to grow more energetic.<br />
<br />
That surge in energy served to get him up to his feet and that was what startled him even more. He found himself standing on his toes and with far more agility and grace then he would have expected. He also didn&#39;t feel the strain of trying to hold up five hundred pounds of fat up either. What doubled Juan&#39;s awareness was that his pants and underwear, which were large to cope with the size he&#39;d been at for years as a result what he&#39;d fallen into over the years just fell down as he stood up. It created the sense of a rather &quot;breezy&quot; feeling as the room&#39;s natural air circulation coming from the AC vents made things a bit cooler. At the same time, his shirt also felt much larger and that his arms didn&#39;t cover as much of the sleeve as he remembered. That got him to look down and realize that while he had sweated a lot, that had actually involved burning out a lot of the excess fat and that which wasn&#39;t lost seemed to also get merged in with his muscle, leaving him for the moment a very well built, if furless Fox Animalian. He also felt a long furless tail wag a bit behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;All that weight is gone!&quot; Juan said excitedly as he actually hoped a bit, exciting having all that excess weight just sweat away. He couldn&#39;t keep his balance super well as he was still a bit unused to the new foot structure, but he managed and the jumps weren&#39;t so much that he would lose his balance. He was just excited about being back down to about where he was before the accident that had hurt his leg, around 190 pounds. &quot;At long last it&#39;s gone and I feel great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Though while the sweating stopped, the warmth remained. Now it was accompanied by some itching. He looked down at himself and to his hands, tipped with short blunt claws and with tougher pads underneath his fingertips. Now though, he could see fur starting to grow in, and like the photos he&#39;d seen on Weebly that showed these various Hybrid Foxes, of which the Golden Island Fox was one of them, it wasn&#39;t like the standard colorations seen in its contributing parents. Most of his fur was largely a golden tan color rather than the all white coloration that the Artic Fox had in winter or the red-orange that the standard Red Fox had all year round. And while the fur on his face and muzzle had a silver tone to it, it was a much lighter shade than the Red Fox&#39;s silver phase and was almost a whitish-gray rather than a dark silver. His chest, inner arms, and inner thighs were white in color, but unlike Red Foxes, which had some form of boots or gloves on the feet that were often dark, his were actually a pure white matching his chest and belly. Even his tail had grown out the long fluffy fur that matched his new coloration, with much of the length being a golden tan with a white tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Teroz,&quot; a voice called through the door, &quot;are you done? I heard something that sounded like excitement...&quot;<br />
<br />
Juan approached the door, &quot;yes... though I will need some new cloths. I&#39;ve lost a LOT of weight as a result of the conversion and will need clothes that can fit my new form better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can be done,&quot; came Simon&#39;s voice through the door, &quot;once you&#39;re ready we can begin going over how the next stages of the program will go for you...&quot;</p>
