<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Maybe we should go inside,&quot; Bobby suggested.  He stood awkwardly adjusting himself and led the way into the house.<br />
<br />
Colleen followed adjusting her shirt around herself.  Bobby's house was always kept so cold.  She kicked off her sandals and sat on the faux-leather couch.  She started rubbing her legs to quiet the goose-bumps that were spreading over her body.<br />
<br />
Bobby slumped in a chair off to the side and studied her.  &quot;You look really good today, Colleen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with these giant lips?&quot;  She pulled her outer shirt more tightly and crossed her arms over her breasts.  She did not like being complemented about her body and Bobby knew that.<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't look so bad.&quot;  He said.  In response Colleen made a disapproving noise and dropped deeper into the cushions.  &quot;What were you saying about your lips outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They grow,&quot; she said curtly.  She was cold and she started rubbing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see?&quot; Bobby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Colleen said.  Her hands moved to her thighs and she started rubbing them.  First all over, but then her hands seemed to stray to the inside more and more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, not?&quot;  Bobby asked watching her intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, then they will get too big and I will have to make them smaller.&quot;  Colleen was suddenly feeling warmer and figured the air conditioning had turned off.  She removed her cover top.  Adjusting her tank top she frowned at how tight it was.  She made a mental note to go shopping soon, otherwise she will stretch all of her clothes out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, make them small after.&quot;  Bobby sat up straight and adjusted himself again.  This time he did not even try to hide the movement.<br />
<br />
Colleen cocked her head and found herself focusing on his crotch.  For a moment she was lost in a daydream.  She thought of how sexy it would be to show Bobby her inflated lips up close.  She could lick them and kiss him or more.  It would be easy to fix things after.  If Bobby did not help her she could fix things on her own.  She came out of her dream with her warm hands pulling her skirt up showing her panties.  The soft couch felt great on her soft bottom and she fought the urge to rub the two together.  &quot;Doing that is embarrassing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Bobby was fascinated.  He had never seen Collen like this.  Her face was flushed and he could see her nipples were erect.  With her left hand she was caressing her stomach and her right hand was doing something between her legs.  Soon, he thought, the other part should kick in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, I will could show you if you agree to help me,&quot; she said.  She was starting to squirm in her seat.  It caused her top to bunch up uncomfortably behind her back.  She fixed it and pulled the straps down off her shoulders.  Pulling her arms out of the loops lessened the tightness across her chest.  Then she noticed that her nipples were hard.  She put her hands over them to warm them up.  She started rubbing them a little.  &quot;You will have to have sex with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn't be a problem.  Are you feeling alright, Colleen?&quot;  Bobby was harder than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; she said a little distracted.  She was focusing on her breasts at the moment.  Her whole body was warm and tingling.  Under her hands nipples seemed to twitch and sing causing pleasant feelings to dart all over her body.  Her hands were suddenly filled with her breasts. She gasped.  Her breasts were bigger now; bulging out of her shirt.  &quot;My bwess jus gah bigga,&quot; she mumbled her lips swelling again.<br />
<br />
She looked at Bobby.  His mouth was agape and his eyes were huge.  He had a hand on his erection.  &quot;Don' jus si' dar!  Wha's happaning?&quot; Colleen's lips were quickly filling out.  Despite her shock she was still groping her breasts.  Once again her nipples were tingling and again her breasts swelled with pleasure.  &quot;Bobby, look a' my bwess!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was.  &quot;Loki was right,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Colleen demanded.  Her shirt was so tight that she peeled it down to let her even larger breasts free.  Seeing Bobby stare at her made Colleen feel even more sexy.  She licked her lips and started playing with herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the prom,&quot; Bobby said never taking his eyes off of Colleen, &quot;Loki came to our table.  He made us play a game, me and the other guys.  He gave each of us a card.  On each was written a curse.  If we read it out loud we would get that curse.  But if we wanted to switch with someone else we could, but we couldn't know what the other curse would be.  Mine was that girls within twenty feet of my erection would become more aroused and their breasts would inflate.  If they moved away or my erection went away, they go back to normal.  I didn't think it was real, until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen's nipples tingled and her breasts pushed out further.  She moaned with the feeling.  &quot;Bobby, 'an oo ma'e i' s'ahp?&quot; She moaned and pleaded.  Her hand was now down her skirt fingering her slit while the other was rubbing her breasts.  Her eyes closed with the pleasure of another cycle of breast growth.  They were at least two cup sizes larger now, than the sports equipment balls they had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we go to my room, maybe we can solve both problems at the same time,&quot; Bobby suggested.</p>
