<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want to stay as your doll, Master.” Amy answered back, her voice still carrying that unfiltered honesty it did before. Her Master smiled down at her, prompting Amy to smile back.<br />
<br />
“Well, in that event, I will need to make a few changes to you. Are you alright with that, little doll?” Came her Master’s reply. <br />
<br />
	Amy had already committed to this, hasn’t she? Why wouldn&#39;t she be alright with a few extra changes? She nodded in reply, giving what she assumed the obvious answer would be. Her Master’s smile remained.<br />
<br />
“Good girl. I knew you’d be content with anymore changes I made, but I wanted to give you the choice,” He offered her his hand, “When you take my hand, your new changes will begin.”<br />
<br />
Amy brought her hand up, and set it on her Master’s hand. A few things immediately took place. First, she felt her face solidify with a slightly pouty smile on her now shiny black lips, as they became sculpted and painted porcelain. Her vision went blurry and slowly shifted to be much more grayscaled as her eyes became glass orbs inside her head. However the blurriness went away as her eyes finished changing with her eyelashes becoming artificial like a proper doll’s. <br />
	<br />
	She looked up at her Master, and attempted to ask him about her new colorblindness, but found herself lacking the ability to speak as her ability to move her mouth left her. It didn’t worry her much. If anything, it made some amount of sense. She was a doll, and had committed to becoming one, thus, she didn’t see much reason for why she would need to speak. <br />
<br />
	Further changes came upon her face, as it rounded out and overall became much more doll-like. Her chin came to a soft point, one that could only be achieved through the sculpting of a face. She looked down at her hands, noticing that she could see the faintest of outlines through the silky material where her joints were. Her fingers, wrists, and elbows were showing ball joints, just like a proper doll would have. <br />
<br />
<br />
	Suddenly, she could feel the air on her thighs. She looked down, noticing now that she had to fully turn her head towards anything she wanted to look at now. Her skirt was now much shorter, only reaching down a quarter of the way of her thighs, and her once-tights were now simply thigh-highs. Around the hem of her thigh highs were white frills and a black ribbon to tie it all off. Another thing she noticed was that her gloves were met with similar treatment to her thigh highs, where once they extended all the way up her arms to her sleeves, they now only reached to her elbow, exposing her ball joint there. <br />
<br />
	Yet more exposure with her outfit came in the form of a neckline on her dress. It was a wide v-shaped neckline, that when paired with her frilly collar, gave a wide diamond-shaped hole through which her porcelain cleavage could be seen. This brought attention to the fact that her breasts hadn’t been so small before. They were still just large enough to show cleavage, but they were never so small. Why would she have large breasts though? It would only distract from her calm, stoic beauty as a doll.<br />
<br />
	Amy looked up at her Master through her new glass eyes, watching her vision swiftly lower then raise back up as she blinked. It seemed her eyes rolled down to blink. Her changes were finished now, weren’t they?<br />
<br />
	She saw her Master’s hand come into view yet again, this time growing larger as he placed his hand on her forehead. For a moment, everything went blank. Amy came to, looking up at her Master, wondering what her next task would be. She didn’t realize it, but he had instantly erased all of the doll’s memories of ever being a human girl. To her, she had always been his little doll, who took care of the shop when he was away, was wound up when she needed it, and kept customers happy. The name ‘Amy’ was swiftly losing its meaning to her now as well. She had always been ‘Little doll’, and not much else. Occasionally Master would call her by other names, but usually it was Little doll<br />
<br />
	“Space out there for a moment, little doll?” He asked, his voice filling her with a mild comfort. She nodded, and kept staring up at him for her next task, “I see… Well, we have customers coming, and I need to go attend to something in the back. It should be a slow night, though, so you only really need to sweep for now.” <br />
<br />
	The doll nodded and went about her task, content with her life as her Master’s Little doll.</p>
