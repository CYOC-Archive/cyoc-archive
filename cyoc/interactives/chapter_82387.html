<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geff became 19 years 364 days 23 hours and 50 minutes old upon the completion of the Chronivac's setup <br />
routine. The Chronivac's programmers considered this story line something of an &quot;Easter Egg&quot; because really, <br />
who would go to the trouble of recreating the world to live in the hardship and unclean drudgery of a peasant?<br />
<br />
Geff had gotten his bearings several moments ago and had come to realize what a terrible and boring mistake it <br />
was to allow the machine to pick his character. He knew he should be heading inside to give his mother the <br />
thirty copper he made this week with the eggs he had gathered moments ago from the chickens, but he didnt want <br />
to play this game. He knew he would go inside, hand over the eggs and coins, eat dinner, go to bed, wake up at <br />
4:30, walk to work, work till nightfall, and repeat. <br />
<br />
On top of this he was pretty close to dumb and didn't like the feeling. Geff wanted to express his frustration <br />
but no longer could think of anything to do other than split wood for the fire or have sex, though he didn't <br />
have a girlfriend and wasn't interested in the animals. <br />
<br />
Geff's mind went blank while trying to figure out a way to pick a new character like a gladiator or druid, <br />
something fun. While Geff was staring into space a daydream started and Geff was assaulted with images which <br />
were surprising and confusing. He tried to stop it, to break away from the trance he was drawn into, but more <br />
and more it became like a video as a story unfurled itself in his mind.<br />
<br />
At first he saw a man. In most images he seemed plain, and initially, he faded into the various scenes as a <br />
background character, sometimes he was a woman or even an animal. The odd thing was that the person Geff saw <br />
was never the same, always shorter, fatter, taller, hairier or more muscular, thinner, sometimes raggedy. Even <br />
a child or elderly in some images. Geff could always recognize him somehow, it was odd. Initially Geff thought <br />
he was imagining himself as a druid or wizard as the features of himself and this man were somewhat similar in <br />
many of the images. Then Geff saw the man standing over another man who was kneeling and pleading. The <br />
following image was the same but the kneeling man was lying on the ground dead, desiccated somehow. The <br />
standing man looked bigger, more muscular, and full of life.<br />
<br />
Horrified, this was the first Geff noticed that he wasn't in control of this movie and tried to stop it. It <br />
only sped up and became short movies instead of images.<br />
<br />
Geff watched helplessly. He saw the man, this time as a woman, stand over a frail sick person on their death <br />
bed, there was a golden glow that went from the woman into the dying person. Somehow Geff knew the others <br />
gathered near the bed couldn't see it. The woman left but the focus lingered on the sick person. The next <br />
scene showed the person well and sitting in a chair with their grandchildren around.<br />
<br />
The next scene was of the man in a crowd, someone brushed by and suddenly the mans coin purse was gone. It was <br />
stolen by a greedy thief who had a job, food, and no family to support. As the visions went on their intensity <br />
grew and Geff was now feeling the emotions of the scenes that played before him. Geff watched, incensed, as <br />
the man found the thief and Geff was, himself, wanting to deal out punishment.<br />
<br />
Watching the man find the thief and address him he could see the thief's energy and read the his history, it <br />
was a strange sensation to Geff, but instinctively he knew he could trust that there were no redeeming <br />
qualities in the thief. He was a bane on society, preying on the weak and manipulating the powerless. Geff <br />
could see the mysterious man knew the same and was eager to watch the thief die. Much to Geff's surprise, <br />
death didn't come and he could almost hear the conversation. A flash of light came from the man and struck the <br />
thief and the man grabbed his money and walked away. Geff knew the light was invisible to all but him and the <br />
man but the scene lingered on the thief. Slowly Geff saw that the thief was changing. <br />
<br />
It took several moments but the thief became a woman, no, a whore. Time passed in the video and Geff saw that <br />
the whore worked hard for their money. On top of being changed into a woman the thief could no longer steal, <br />
Geff saw her try, the money immediately became red hot in their hand and they dropped the coins, clutching <br />
their burned hand. Only money freely given could be grasped. Geff felt it was a worthy punishment but thought <br />
it was letting them off a little easy.<br />
<br />
Geff faded out of the trance slightly to realize that the man is just and powerful though he still didn't <br />
understand what was happening. The mental release was temporary as his mind was suddenly hurled back into the <br />
story of the strange man.<br />
<br />
There were several more scenes and with each one it seemed like his connection to the man was stronger, from <br />
each movie he could see deeper into the surrounding circumstances like he was there, knew the characters and <br />
could hear the conversations.<br />
<br />
The scene was dark he could hear whispers, giggles and some small chatter. As his eyes adjusted to the dark he <br />
could tell the man was in the form of an older teen or young man roughly Geff's age. There was a young girl <br />
with him. She seemed strangely familiar but Geff couldn't place from where, Geff's night vision was <br />
supernaturally enhanced in that he could now make out everything. The strange man, teen here, was getting it <br />
on with a girl he met in the town he was passing through. The man knew this was the girl he wanted, he (and <br />
Geff within the vision) could see she was healthy, as well as kind, good hearted, moral and just. The man <br />
wanted to bless her though Geff couldn't understand how having sex was blessing her, regardless of how good it <br />
was.<br />
<br />
Geff could see their aura's and could tell both were fully enjoying themselves. They both simultaneously <br />
climaxed and Geff saw a slight red glow from the man's groin enter the girl. The scene suddenly cut to the <br />
woman crying several days later, Geff knew the man had left and the girls heart was crushed.<br />
<br />
Unlike the normal &quot;movies&quot; this scene kept following this girl rather than jumping back to the man. The girl <br />
had met a new boy a week later and the relationship escalated quickly. The girl had sex with this man too and <br />
still had a red glow from her encounter with the strange man who had now seemed to have left the story. The <br />
woman's stomach began to grow and Geff realized that she was pregnant with the strange man's child.<br />
<br />
The vision responded to his recognition and zoomed past the pregnancy to the birth, the rebound man was there <br />
glowing with pride, apparently under the impression that the child was his. The child came out, a boy, and was <br />
glowing red. Again, Geff knew only he could see the color, some sort of indication of power.<br />
<br />
Glimpses of early childhood passed and started coming at blinding speed as time sped up, and Geff realized the <br />
truth of the situation. The images halted on a barn and slowly zoomed in. Within the barn the child of the man <br />
stood glowing in a radiant red aura, the untapped power practically kissing the rafters. At the heart of the <br />
overwhelmingly vibrant aura stood Geff.<br />
<br />
Geff was staring at himself from third person view, and just as he could read other people's auras from within <br />
the vision, he read his own. Geff saw he was the child of a god and himself immortal unless he chooses to die. <br />
Just as he had seen his father do, he could change form at will, or the form and minds of others. He could <br />
create, he could destroy, he could magically empower objects, he was unlimited.<br />
<br />
Geff reeled for a moment from the understanding. He could see his arms outstretched, head skywards, and his <br />
unseeing eyes milky white in the throws of the vision. Once he had fully understood and accepted his godhood <br />
the aura around him shrank and intensified, more and more till it was no longer red but white. Then even more <br />
until it wasnt a color, just blinding. Looking at himself was painful. There was some sort of explosion of <br />
power from within Geff which even pushed away the magical eye which Geff was viewing himself through. Geff's <br />
perspective was thrust out of the barn and into the woods and up into the air, hundreds of feet away, it kept <br />
rocketing back without loosing speed. The force of the explosion was magically equal to the sun but like an <br />
EMP burst only effects electronics, this didn't hurt his non magical surroundings. <br />
<br />
The vision Geff was under dissipated after his perspective was rocketed multiple days distance away and miles <br />
into the sky. Geff realized he was staring at the ceiling with his arms wide open like he was trying to give <br />
the sky a hug.</p>
