<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">§ Some of these spaces seem redundant or overlapping in my perspective, so I&#39;m retconning the spaces for this branch before we get too much further. The new list of spaces will be the following:<br />
<br />
- Red: Female Based TF<br />
- Blue: Male Based TF (Agreed by Gabriel, Amy, Helen, and Kelly to be nerfed to only operate as a futanari/penis expansion space instead)<br />
- Pink: Bimbo TF<br />
- Green: Plant TF<br />
- Silver: Mechanical TF<br />
- Yellow: Animal TF<br />
- Orange: Race/Ethnicity TF<br />
- Turquoise: Merge/Split TF<br />
- Purple: Sentient Species TF (Covers the gamut of all Mythical, Fantasy, Sci-Fi/Alien, Anime, etc. non-human intelligent species)<br />
- Magenta: Sexual TF<br />
- Lime Green: Muscle TF<br />
- Tan: Growth/Shrinking TF<br />
- Black: Monster/Horror TF<br />
- Sky Blue: Hyper TF<br />
- Brown: Swapping TF<br />
- Vermillion: Mental TF<br />
- Teal: Age TF<br />
- Rainbow: Random/Any<br />
<br />
In addition there are three other colored spaces on this retconned board:<br />
<br />
- White: Neutral/No TF<br />
- Cyan: Share the TF<br />
- Gold: Event Space<br />
<br />
With those changes in mind, let us continue. Also, while I am starting this branch, always feel free to add your own branch if you see fit, or just read and enjoy. §<br />
<br />
<br />
Amy finished setting up the board, noticing the game pieces, totalling 13 in all, were all nondescript grey humanoid figures with slightly different poses, which made it barely possible to tell them apart. There was also two six-sided dice and one twenty-sided die. Interestingly the six-sided dice were labeled 0 through 5 instead of 1 through 6, Amy noticed. In the middle of the board, dwelling in a most ominous way was a peculiar flat shimmering amethyst plinth. There also weren&#39;t any cards or anything. Odd.<br />
&quot;This is a rather weird game and I still don&#39;t get what some of these spaces mean, but I&#39;m in.&quot; Kelly said, placing down her piece, a figure with its arms raised overhead in a sort of victory pose. She picked it since it looked the manliest, to her also looking like it was flexing.<br />
<br />
Helen says, &quot;It all sounds hokum, but I&#39;m willing to try it if you guys are.&quot; placing a figure that looked it was adjusting glasses, which Helen thought matched with the fact she wore thick glasses. In a way it felt apropos for the more nerdy member of the quartet.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Amy&#39;s labrador retriever Sandy ran in and bumped into the table while trying to get Amy&#39;s attention, causing a player piece to fall over in the floor, which gets Sandy&#39;s attention and she picks it up. &quot;Bad girl. Hand it over.&quot; Amy said sternly but calmly, which Sandy replies to promptly and happily, dropping the piece in Amy&#39;s hand. She notices it looks like it has its hand outstretched as though to shake hands before setting it on the side of the board for now, planning to clean it off before putting it back up. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll put my piece down while I&#39;m thinking about it.&quot; She puts down a piece with hands on their hips, seeming to exude an air of maturity, much like Amy does.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasures? One wish? You have the funniest tastes Amy.&quot; Gabriel puts down a piece that looked like they were bent back laughing, which oddly suited the mirthful Gabriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what now?&quot; Helen asked. Suddenly violet smoke billowed from the crystal plinth and thunder rumbled throughout the room. Sandy barked at the tirade the board was producing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!!&quot; Amy shouts.<br />
&quot;Nani?!&quot; Helen blurts.<br />
&quot;The fuck is all this?!&quot; Kelly screams.<br />
&quot;Cool special effects.&quot; Gabriel nervouls jokes.<br />
<br />
As the thunder winds down and the smoke starts the clear, a cute female voice starts to whine in a terrified timbre above them, &quot;Oh, no no no!! Not again!! Please!! No more!!&quot;<br />
<br />
An astute Helen notices a purple glow outside the window before saying, &quot;I call tell you came from inside the board, so there&#39;s no point in asking that. Honestly, if there wasn&#39;t something like you or some other supernatural force involved I really wouldn&#39;t know how anyone would take this game seriously, because there is a limit to the rationality of what role playing could portray, plus I noticed this game didn&#39;t come with anything but the board, the player pieces, and three dice, so there had to be something else. More importantly though is who you are and why you in this board.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the smoke cleared, it revealed a beautiful young adult woman with long silvery-white tied up in a ponytail that was at least five feet long dressed in a violet halter top, billowy pants, and pointy shoes that resemble something similar to what a belly dancer might where. She also wore two large heavy gold bracelets on her wrists. She had a very narrow but toned waist and wide hips, but a modest bust, about only a B-cup. Most notably about her though was the fact she had a white-furred five foot long monkey tail extending out from just above her buttocks, wearing a violet bow near the end of it.<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so sorry all of you!!&quot; the mysterious floating tailed lady says, wringing her hands. &quot;I hate this game so much, but now that you put your pieces on the board there isn&#39;t much I can do about it.&quot; She sighs, before lowering herself down to the ground between Amy and Helen. &quot;As Helen deduced, there is more than meets the eye to this game. I&#39;m Salina, a genie exploited and then cursed to this game board by a wicked necromancer ages ago. I- I&#39;m basically the thing that makes the game work in the first place, the thing that enacts the transformations, answers any questions players may have, and grants the wish at the end, however... THIS WHOLE GAME DISGUSTS ME!! I DON&#39;T LIKE TRANSFORMING PEOPLE LIKE THIS!! CURSE THAT MAN!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re a genie, can&#39;t you just destroy the board?&quot; Amy asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wish!! However, because of how the necromancer engineered his cursed wishes, the board is essentially my lamp now, and a genie&#39;s lamp can only be destroyed upon granting a genie their freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people would ask if they could wish you free, but given you haven&#39;t offered us wishes nor said why you haven&#39;t tried to convinced previous players to wish you free, there must be a catch. am I right?&quot; Helen calculated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, quite astute Helen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Kelly interrupts, &quot;...how the hell do you know our names? Are you reading our minds?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t read your mind,&quot; Salina replies, &quot;but I could hear and see you while I was still sealed. Now, back to what I was saying, the necromancer in fact set up a rather nasty set of restrictions in order to force people to play this insidious game. Firstly, he limited my wish-granting powers to only those who win this game, and then only one wish. Second, he DID include a clause in my curse that would allow me to go free and destroy this game forevermore, but the stipulation is I have to grant ten wishes from people that play this game, with the further caveat those wishes cannot be for any changes done to one&#39;s self cannot be undone, nor can they try to wish for the events of the game in any way undone, or have reality rewritten to ease the burden of the changes, or try to destroy the game or free me from my fate in any way. You CAN wish to undo your own changes or rewrite reality if you win, but wishing to undo playing the game or destroying it or freeing me are verboten. Not only will you waste your wish, but the game rules would force me to punish you, and I dread the idea of doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should just leave...&quot; Gabriel blurts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t advise it.&quot; Helen states succinctly. &quot;If what Salina is saying is true, and what I noticed outside is what I&#39;m thinking, we&#39;re trapped.&quot; Aidible gasps fill the room. &quot;If anime has taught me anything, we&#39;re stuck here now until there is a winner, and escape is either impossible, heavily punished, or both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Salina bats her eyes in surprise. &quot;That&#39;s... Exactly right. Another dumb rule I&#39;m forced to uphold. If you try to leave the house you&#39;ll receive a random large penalty and be forcefully teleported immediately back to the table. Also, delaying the game for more than fifteen minutes constitutes a transformation penalty, and forfeiting results in severe IRREVERSIBLE penalties. Finally, if anyone enters the veil during gameplay they too will be forced to join the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I guess our only REAL choice is to play then, as we had planned all along.&quot; Amy responds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, prepare the five of you!!&quot; Salina exclaims as a gust of wind whips around her, conjuring sheets of paper flying about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five of us?&quot; Amy retorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!! Check out the pieces!!&quot; Kelly blurts out, noting the bland nondescript humanoid game pieces now looked almost like spot on replicas of the four of them, plus...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandy?&quot; Amy said, looking at one of the pieces, now a labrador retriever with a paw out looking to shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, by being in the area of the veil and handling a game piece, she met the requirements to form the player contract like the rest of you... however, I can understand your disbelief and confusion. Don&#39;t worry. While she still has the intellect of a dog, I have bestowed upon her the wisdom of the game, her contract, and everything it entails. Sandy basically has enough wherewithal to know how to play the game and why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense.&quot; Helen remarks, adjusting her glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re awfully nonchalant about all of this Helen.&quot; Amy quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were all oddly on board with playing a strange fetishy possibly magical board game no one has heard of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that as well. Another part of this dumb cursed board game. Until I make my presence known the board generates an aura of plausible deniability to trick all but the most astute from ignoring the absurdity of this game&#39;s mechanics and still want to play it. You saw through it though Helen, but still chose to play. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping to become something cuter, honestly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Helen...&quot; Amy said in a forlorn manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;At any rate, as much as I hate it, I have to start the game.&quot; Salina gestures and the papers floating around her go to each player. &quot;Think of these almost like character sheets. They keep track of who you are at the start of the game, your current state, all the transformations you have been through, actions you took, penalties accrued, and so forth. Very useful to keep track of what has happened during the game, and how many changes you have had in each category.&quot; Salina then picks up the D20. &quot;You already know what the spaces are, and as I can see, took advantage of one of the game rules intrinsically to modify one of them already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was my idea.&quot; Helen says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at any rate, what you didn&#39;t know is, the first time a player encounters a space, it will give a particular change based on one&#39;s gender. Do note I said &#39;gender,&#39; not &#39;sex.&#39; Afterwards, your second and any further encounters with the same space, such as landing on the silver space a second, third, fourth, etc. time, results in you getting a transformation of random severity as determined by this Dice of Transformation. Think of it like reverse D&D. Rolling a 1 is good and lets you get away with the least amount of change possible, with each progressive number increasing the degree of transformation that turn, all of which are random. Roll a 20 though and it&#39;s an automatic full transformation into whatever that space warrants.&quot;<br />
Salina floats over above Kelly and continues, &quot;Finally, three more things. First, your turn order was decided by when you put your game pieces on the board, meaning Kelly goes first, followed by Helen, then Sandy, then Amy, and finally Gabriel. Second, before we even start, you&#39;ll have to play a sort of &#39;Press Your Luck&#39; buzzer game with that gem in the middle to get, ahem, &#39;awarded&#39; a free transformation right off the bat? Why you ask? Because it deals with the last thing I&#39;ll mention for now, which is the game board isn&#39;t static. The spaces randomize with each turn, and furthermore they get weighted, or I guess it&#39;s better to say, somewhat rigged, to generate more spaces similar to whatever this first transformation you get pre-game. I know, it&#39;s rude. Also...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh!!&quot; Kelly sighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;...just because you start or complete one transformation branch doesn&#39;t mean other transformation spaces can&#39;t affect you either. You can land one a mix of blue, silver, yellow, tan, magenta, sky blue spaces, and rainbow spaces and end up a 50&#39; tall obscenely horny giant dicked robot wolf with bimbofying cum for all you know.&quot; This elicited a variety of looks, from shock from Amy, unease from Gabriel, subtle curiosity from Kelly, and a desire for head pats from Sandy.<br />
&quot;Now, if you will, by turn order, place your hand in the center and press it when your ready. Sadly, all the spaces are whammies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly goes first, slamming down on pink. Helen goes next, hitting purple. With a little help from Amy, Sandy slaps her paw down on red. Amy pressed down and got lime green. Finally, Gabriel pressed the gem and got a rainbow hue underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; Amy says, before seeing Kelly freak out. Her jeans and hoodie were morphing across her body, splitting in parts, becoming a small button-up shirt tied up under her A-cup breasts, a pink tartan microskirt held in place by a silver belt with a heart-shaped buckle, half a dozen gold & silver bangles & bracelets on each wrist, a pair of large gaudy rings on each hand, a pink choker with &quot;KITTY&quot; written out in rhinestones, a necklace with a heart pendant attached, massive gold hoop earrings, kneehigh leg warmers, and half-inch heeled cross trainers on her feet. Kelly was dressed like some kind of sexy gyaru bimbo schoolgirl, with Sandy passively noticing Kelly had no underwear on under her skirt or shirt. The look strongly juxtaposed with her muscled almost amazonian physique and her green dyed practically buzzed in the back and sides faux-mohawk pixie cut hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I dressed so girly and slutty?&quot; Kelly opines.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got the first change for the &#39;bimbo&#39; for someone that is gendered male... I see.&quot; Salina remarks, giving a coy eyebrow raise of understanding towards, realising she was trans. &quot;That first change is &#39;permanent bimbo wardrobe.&#39; Basically, unless you find a way to reverse or overwrite this change, you have the dress like a bimbo, and if you try to dress in anything not fitting that mold, you secrete a magical enzyme that morphs all clothes to become sexier, so while I know you&#39;re wanting to become more masculine, you&#39;re now stuck wearing cute tiny sexy tops, miniskirts, and lots of jewelry for the foreseeable future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw man!!&quot; Kelly groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It also means the board will also be weighted to have a higher percentage of pink spaces on your turns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly just made a series of frustrated grunts. Meanwhile Helen is getting her pre-game transformation, oddly moaning and tapping a sneakered heel repeatedly on the ground as a hole with an elastic strap magically forms on the back of her jeans at the top of her butt, right where a green furren cat tail slithers out, reaching four feet in length.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tha- that felt WAY better than it had any business needed to!!&quot; Helen moans as though she was about to orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense. Tails ARE connected to the spine, so they would be extra sensitive. I know mine was the same way when the necromancer forced one on me.&quot; Helen looked on her character form to see that she had been bestowed a catgirl&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Sandy was next, as her muzzle went splat on her face, her black nose peeling away, leaving behind a petite button nose, while the rest of her facial featured softened and humanized, fur shedding off her face as well, all the while the fur atop her head grew thicker, the result being that Sandy was now a human-faced dog that looked she had chin-length hair and bangs swept to the left, something of a faux &quot;Rachel.&quot; Sandy lolled her tongue out to pant. She licked her nose and felt something was vaguely off, like she missed part of her snout just then, but then an itch in her shoulder got her attention and proceeded to scratch it, putting the whole odd missing snout feeling out of mind.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s pre-game change was next, and she started to feel her arms and legs bulge with power as her gut rumbled a little. Being the somewhat overweight member of the group, Amy was shocked to watch the flesh in her arms and legs tighten, the beginnings of bicep and tricep definition form in her arms and calf definition began to take hold in her white & blue thighhigh stocking coated legs as she lost weigh in her midsection. For a moment the top half & sleeves of her short sleeved white hoodie, the hem of her blue skirt, and her stockings felt tight on her chest, upper arms, thighs, and shins, respectively, and loose around her waist, before readjusting to fit properly again. Amy looked over herself and postulated that maybe two or three more of changes like those and she&#39;d be as ripped as Kelly, but will her clothes hold up, examining her outfit for tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Unless as a result of a penalty or a very advanced animal transformation, your clothes will always grow or shrink to fit your proportions. You can grow 100&#39; tall and have mountainous muscles or be a 2&#39; tall 4 year old catgirl, but your clothes will still fit just fine no matter what. Your clothes will also modify to take account for gaining or losing new limbs, as you most likely noticed with your friend Helen&#39;s pants and her new tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Gabriel&#39;s change happened and... he prostrated a look like a thousand people just kicked him in the junk. &quot;The... FUCK?!&quot; He slumps out of his chair holding his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know they&#39;re sensitive, but is it THAT bad?&quot; Salina grimaces, worried about Gabriel.<br />
<br />
He reaches under his pants, surprised to still feel his dick, but below it was the REAL surprise. &quot;Where my nuts go? Also, there&#39;s something slip- ...and that&#39;s a vagina. I&#39;m a futa now, right?&quot; he quips.<br />
<br />
Salina throws him a nod before turning to Kelly. &quot;Now that all the preliminaries are over, it&#39;s time you took your first turn Kelly. If I could, I&#39;d bless your dice with high rolls, but that&#39;s also against the rules. I have to be a neutral arbitrator of the game&#39;s rules and whims, sadly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly takes up the two D6, and when she does, everyone watches as the spaces blink and flash at breakneck speed as she tosses the dice. Only once the dice landed and settled in place did the light show that was the space randomization stop, the dice landing on a 3 and a 2, totalling 5. Kelly went to move her piece, which had changed once more to match her new wardrobe, but her, and everyone&#39;s shock, the piece ran on its own to the intended space, which was... &quot;Ugh, a pink space?&quot; The D20 Dice of Transformation appears before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roll to see the severity of the transformation now...&quot; Salina reminds Kelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as this is over I&#39;m summoning that necromancer&#39;s soul from Hell just for the express purpose of shoving this game up his spectral ass!!&quot; she hurls the die with an angry vengeance, unknowingly banking it off a barrier put in place by the game to keep the dice from flying off to who knows where. It bounds around the board, before slowing its roll and landing on a 6. As soon as it stopped, the amethyst plinth lit up and began to display the damage this turn it was going to do Kelly:<br />
<br />
- Bimbo Psyche: Acquired &quot;Loves Bimbo Fashion&quot;<br />
- Bimbo Psyche: Bimbo Libido value increased by 9%<br />
- Bimbo Psyche: Intellect reduced by 10 points<br />
- Bimbo Psyche: Alter Vocal Inflexions 18% higher, Start Rudimentary &quot;Valley Girl&quot; vocal mannerisms<br />
- Bimbo Physique: Advance Bust Size from &quot;A-Cup&quot; to &quot;E-Cup&quot;<br />
-Bimbo Physique: Shift Hair Color 42% towards acceptable blonde ranges<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell does all that mean? It all, like, sounds like gibberish...&quot; Kelly covered her mouth as she not only heard her voice raise an octave, but also change ever slightly in accent, hinting at the ditzy tones of those stereotypical blonde dummies you see on TV, but most jarring... &quot;Did I just say &#39;like,&#39; you know, in a bimbo-y way?&quot; Everyone nodded. This proved a perfect distraction for Kelly&#39;s chest to balloon out and her hair color to morph, her hair now going from a solid green dye job to an eye-catching lime green with solid green tips. Kelly scratched her head as she felt a light fog take her, and without realizing it, forgot what she learned in some of her college classes. On Kelly&#39;s &quot;character sheet&quot; all the transformations that just occurred appeared on the sheet, and showed her new stats in comparison to her old ones.<br />
&quot;What a head rush... Helen, your go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Helen went next, watching the board go wild as she threw her dice. A 4 and a 0. Her piece ran forward and landed on a turquoise space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s how this works. You&#39;ll roll twice. The first time it&#39;s to determine if the effect will be for merging or splitting. An odd number represents merging, while evens splitting. The second is the nature and severity roll, kind of like what Kelly did just a moment ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, Helen throws the D20, getting a 14 on her first throw. &quot;Split.&quot; Salina succinctly answers.<br />
<br />
Helen grabs up the D20 again, saying, &quot;Just don&#39;t do anything weird, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Gabriel gestures towards Kelly and Sandy.<br />
<br />
Helen tosses the die and gets... a NAT 20!! Great if this was D&D, but in this game it meant a full change, or in this case...<br />
<br />
- Splitting Effect: Full Duplication, Separate Individual<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;m getting a twin.&quot; Helen remarked, before feeling a wealth of sensations concentrated near the end of her tail. The tail was already so new and alien, and now, a strange flesh sac, in a way resembling a giant placenta was growing rapidly on the tip of her tail. In under a minute, the tail placenta was adult sized as Helen was panting and glowing, the look she had oddly orgasmic. &quot;F- Fuck...&quot; Everyone did a double take. Helen wasn&#39;t the one to swear except in extreme situations, so whatever was happening must have been AMAZING. Suddenly the placenta detached from Helen&#39;s tail, fur regrowing in the spot where it grew from, as moments later a pair of hands rip through the fleshy membrane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s help her out!!&quot; Gabriel says as he runs over, assisting the new duplicate Helen to free herself from her fleshy prison.<br />
<br />
After almost a minute, Gabriel and Kelly pull the second Helen free. Curiously, she came out not only clothed, but wearing the same outfit as her quote-unquote &quot;mother.&quot; Furthermore, within moments of getting free, she seemed to be magically self-cleaned of any and all of the gunk from being gestated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we got two orders of business now.&quot; Salina brought up. &quot;One, now that there are two of you, we obviously can&#39;t call you both &#39;Helen&#39; now, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The new Helen quickly answered this. &quot;This may sound odd, but thanks to anime we decided to come up with a contingency for just a situation, and as such we had always had a perfect name set aside for such a scenario. Original me will keep our old name, while the new me will go by the name &#39;Mira.&#39; You know, Helen and Mira. A play off of Helen Mirren...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly gives the duo a deadpan stare. &quot;We like, got to get you away from the anime and totally laid...... I did it again, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The second issue,&quot; Salina states, &quot;is that with Mira&#39;s mere existence inside this house it also means she&#39;s now a player as well.&quot; With that comment, Mira receives her own player sheet and places her own piece down at start; a figure doing a fist pump in the air. &quot;Since it seems you have all of Helen&#39;s memories up to the point of your conception, there&#39;s no real need to explain what comes next.&quot; Mira places her hand over the plinth and slams it down, hitting it when it stops on blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, man...&quot; Mira whines as everyone notices a slight bulging in Mira&#39;s groin. Kelly grumbled and tried crossing her arms, before remembering her larger breasts, making her sulk harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your turn has been inserted here after Helen&#39;s, so go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mira threw the two D6 and got a 1 and a 4, 5 total. Her piece ran forward and landed on a pink space, but also, she landed on the same space as Kelly&#39;s piece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since this is your first time on the pink track you know you get a guaranteed change. For females it&#39;s instant automatic permanent platinum blonde hair. However, if you recall, there is a rule that you have to take extra changes for every player already on the space, so throw the Dice of Transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mira gulped and dropped it on the board. It landed on a 2, causing the following:<br />
<br />
- Bimbo Physique: Acquired Permanent Bimbo Wardrobe<br />
- Bimbo Psyche: Intellect reduced by 5 points<br />
<br />
Mira felt a little dizzy as, like Kelly before her, her clothes turned to jelly as they changed, her Tokyo Mew Mew print shirt, which she shared in common which her progenitor Helen, warped into an alluring half-length button-up lilac crop top, exposing her soft midriff, as her jeans warp into a hip-hugging white leather miniskirt barely reaching a quarter of the way down her thighs, replete with tail hole in the back, kneehigh fishnets on her lower legs, and lilac 2&quot; heels. She also had several thin chains on her neck and large dangling heart-shaped earrings. Mira, in coincidentally complementary fashion to Kelly, was dressed every bit the bimbo teacher, and just like Kelly, Mira had absolutely no underwear under her top or skirt, meaning anyone who looked up said skirt would clearly see Mira had both a penis and vagina, making her a futa like Gabriel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eep!!&quot; Mira gasps trying to pull the hem of the overly short skirt down, aware it was just BARELY concealing her new wang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax!! You&#39;re rocking that skirt, Mira!!&quot; Kelly praised her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before delay of game penalties start going out, let&#39;s move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy flashes Salina a stern look and asks, &quot;Sandy&#39;s a dog. How is she...?&quot;<br />
<br />
