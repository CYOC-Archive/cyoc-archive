<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been a few days since Morgan Le Fays appearance. For Lisa, Katie, and Gloria it had been a troubling time.<br />
<br />
Marilyn, Ann, and Jackie were gone. Morgan had taken the three of them with her trickery. While Katie worked to try and fix things; Lisa and Gloria were in mourning. Lisa had lost another sister and her mother while Gloria had lost her oldest friend. Not surprisingly the two were withdrawn, not even raising a fuss as their older selves setup temporary residence.<br />
<br />
Lynne and Tricia reacted differently to seeing their families once more. For Tricia it was a joyous reunion, she had missed her parents greatly and was all too happy to see them. Going so far as to have them meet their college age selves. Lynne though was having a difficult time.<br />
<br />
Lynne was saddened that her actions had inadvertantly resulted in the loss of her grandmother while creating a twin sister. Emily as it turned out was a total opposite of Lynne. Emily was shy and withdrawn, her sister was her best friend as she kept to herself mostly. She now had memories that Lynne did not have, resulting in a strained relationship between the two.<br />
<br />
Lynne&#39;s parents did not blame Lynne for this, understanding that Morgan had tricked her. Still, Lynne couldn&#39;t help but feel that she had ruined the future and ruined her family.<br />
<br />
Lynne now sadly gazed at the street as her mother and sister approached. &quot;You doing okay sis,&quot; Emily asked. Lynnr grumpily gazed at her twin sighing. &quot;Im fine,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Just thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we always talk when you have something on your mind,&quot; Emily said sadly. &quot;We tell eachother everything. We dont keep secrets from one another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats how you remember things,&quot; Lynne said bitterly. &quot;When I left, you didn&#39;t exist and thats my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s lip quivered as she began to turn away. &quot;Lynne &quot; Lisa sad sternly. &quot;Its nit your sisters fault, dont take this out in her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Its just....she&#39;s my grandmother, not my sister.  I messed up bad mom, I...dint kniw how to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed sadly as she now squeezed her daughters shoulders. &quot;We&#39;ll figure this out kid,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;Its just going to take sometime. Just have faith.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne smiled up at her mother, appreciating her mothers words. Befire anyone could say anything they heard a loud knock at the front door. As the Jason of this timeline had done since everything happened, he slowly appriached the door, his gun at the ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason please,&quot; the older Lisa sighed. &quot;I keep telling you to stop. Your being paranoid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to protect my family,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;If that is the sorceress you talked about I won&#39;t let her harm anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it was that gun wont help,&quot; Lisa moaned. &quot;She would just transfirm it before you fired a shot. Just answer the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason frowned at the older woman as he tucked the gun away. As he opened the door he was puzzled by who he saw. &quot;Kellie what are you doing here? And why are you a teenager?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellue sighed as she looked at her sisters husband. She had yet to meet this man but could see that Lisa had good taste. He was tall and handsome. If the situation were different she would be less forward. She didnt have time for subtly though, Ann and Jackie were counting on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No time to explain,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I need to speak with Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
The older Lisa had heard thr girl asking for her. As she approached she smiled, hugging the girl tightly. &quot;Kellie,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;Oh sis Im so glad you came, things have been awful around here we could really use your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Kellie said, slightly confused. &quot;How do you know who I am? And why do you look so much older.&quot;<br />
<br />
The older Lisa smiled at her sister as she placed her hamd on the girls shoulder.  &quot;Ive known for a few years now Kel,&quot; she smirked. &quot;At least I will in the future. Present day me doesn&#39;t though. This is about to get real awkward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait your from the future, How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;But we really dont have time. Come in so we can talk, ill introduce you to your nieces.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie was shocked that a future version of Lisa was present here. Things appeared more chaotic here than she thought. &quot;Nieces what are you talkimg about?&quot; Rounding the corner she now saw two auburn haired 14 year olds. The teens smiled brightly as they raced to hug the teen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Kellie so great to see you,&quot; Emily exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hows life with Merlin,&quot; Lynne asked. &quot;The other timeline doing okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm yes,&quot; she answered. Kellie was shocked to see these people, even more surprised that their knowledge of the other timeline seemed so common. &quot;Look sorry but this is a bit much, who are you and how do you all know about the other timeline.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa, Lynne and Emily niw began talking in an animated fashion as they talked about what had happened. Kellie listened intently, she had gotten some information from Ann and Jackie but now these three were filling in the rest, as they finished she sighed. &quot;So its pretty much what I thought, Morgan tricked Ann and Jackie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne, Lisa and Emily nodded. &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Lisa said sadly. &quot;The Lisa in this time was devastated when Ann told her,  especially since it meant Morgan could attack again. Thankfully we&#39;ve put protections around Lisa so she&#39;ll be okay until after she gives birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Im guessing your here to help,&quot; Lynne stated.<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as she looked at her family. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;Specifically Ann and Jackie, it was an accident that this happened. I need everyones help getring them back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats not going to be easy,&quot; Lynne sighed. &quot;Everyone feels kind of betrayed by them and convincing them that Morgan wont use them will be hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also convincing everyone that your Kellie O&#39;Toole wont be easy,&quot; Emily said quietly. &quot;Everyone in this time doesn&#39;t know about alternate timelines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to try,&quot; Kellie said stoically. &quot;Ann and Jackie need our help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ill help you,&quot; Lisa stated. &quot;The question is now, how do we introduce you to everyone?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she now tried to come up with an answer.</p>
