<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff is relieved when he feels himself transforming again. He his overjoyed to feel the overwhelming taste fade away completely as his inner self revert back from a gel like substances to a dry powder. He feels himself unroll and and lift into the air getting out of the diaper pail. &quot;Wait, something is wrong here !&quot; Jeff thinks while getting very worried. The comforting transforming sensation left him as he landed neatly folded on the top of the diaper stack ready to be used again. Jeff's mind could not admit what obviously just happened. He was confused wondering why the transformation was taking so much time. He had waited so long to change back and now it was finally going to happen. Surely he could wait a bit longer he thought. Especially now that the accursed taste and smell had at long last left him. Jeff never being so happy of not smelling or tasting anything. To him, the lack of taste was somehow the best taste in itself. &quot;It's over, I wont be tasting anything like that ever again&quot; he rejoiced while still waiting for the very slow transformation.<br />
<br />
He waited and waited some more. it was hard to tell how long as he had absolutely no reference. But a part of him was getting worried. He was slowly losing confidence. after all, the transformation did stop before. Then he remembered that the device was still being tested. Perhaps it was buggy ? Maybe the OS crashed and it would never complete the transformation unless someone fixed it. The more Jeff thought about it the more he got worried. His mind still not wanting to admit the cruel and obvious truth. The thought that the Chronivac did exactly what it intended and that the transformation was in fact complete and successful still not crossing his mind. But it was slowly making his way there.<br />
<br />
Time past and past some more when he eventually heard Nina (his baby sister) crying nearby. He guessed that they were in the nursery and that she was laid in her crib. His mother came into the room shortly after to check up on her daughter. &quot;Don't cry sweety. Mommy is here for you&quot; She said trying to comfort her daughter. &quot;Oh my ! It's ok sweety. Mommy is going to make it all better.&quot; She said shortly after as if suddenly realizing something. Meanwhile Jeff was trying to figure out his exact location as well as what he was now. He know that he was a soiled disposable diaper and that the Chronivac was supposed to change him back. But he assumed that the Chronivac screwed up somewhere stopping midway. He was trying to figure what he was now. A towel maybe ? He felt absorbent and folded up on some desk. But that did not seem quite right. But somehow, his current location, body position and absorbent feeling all seem very familiar. Yes, almost like he's been threw all this before.<br />
<br />
That is when he felt his sister being laid on the same desk. Then he realize that there are no desk in the nursery, but there is a changing table. A changing table full of baby supplies... Jeff was getting worried sick as his mind could not avoid the obvious truth much longer. &quot;Let's get you nice and clean !&quot; he heard his mother say as she grabbed him, opened him and placed him beside his sister. Jeff was completely horrified as he finally understood what his mother was doing. Now opened, he could see his mother pull aside a dripping wet diaper and then proceed to clean her bottom with a baby wipe. &quot;OMG she is changing her ! This can't be happening ! Anything but that !&quot; He thought hysterically as his mother gently slid him under his sister before lowering her down on him. &quot;It did not failed to change me back ! The damn thing actually transformed me into a fresh diaper !&quot; He thought clearly panicking as his mother was applying a generous amount of baby powder. &quot;A freaking diaper ! Ready to be used by my damn sister ! Please God have mercy on me ! I can't go threw all this again !&quot; He prayed hard as his mother was tapping him shut. He was worn... once again. Only this time he knew all to well how it feels to be a diaper. Jeff could not stop mentally crying as he stared at his sister's private areas fearing he see some bad signs.<br />
<br />
Thus began the new diaper life of Jeff. Each time the 48 hours was up, the Chronivac would refresh the transformation according to previous settings (namely a disposable diaper). Jeff's family obviously realized that their son and brother was missing. But they concluded that he ran away from home. So his mother left his room (including the Chronivac and computer) untouched so that everything would be as he left it if he ever came back home. As the weeks past by, Jeff experienced all kind of state. Wet, wet and messy, Extra wet, just messy, ETC. He also experienced various types of piss and shit which were varying according to his sister diet. The variety made it hard to get used to it as it was always different. He still manage to get used to it several months later when the taste finally drove him insane. This was shortly before his sister began potty training. Part of him was hoping that someone would find the Chronivac one day. Maybe his other sister would remember that strange device that she saw her brother play with one day. Perhaps his mother would find it while dusting his old room. Maybe the company that gave him the device would eventually check back on it. Discovering everything once they do. At worst, Nina would be potty trained soon. So this would at least allow him to take his retirement from his already to long diaper career.<br />
<br />
Or so he thought. He heard his mother speak to his dad about starting a baby daycare center. Apparently she likes taking cares of babies a lot. Going so far as baby sitting for the neighbors and with her last child growing past this now, she would be left with unused maternal instinct. Having raised 3 children, the house was already full of toys and various supplies. Beside, diapers seemed to cost less lately. Having her own baby daycare center seemed like a wonderful idea to her and Jeff's dad was encouraging her in that way. Seems like their would be no retirement...</p>
