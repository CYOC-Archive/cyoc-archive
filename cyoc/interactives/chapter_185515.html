<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was a 25 year old young adult male who just finished his studies, but didn&#39;t started to work yet. He was on a trip, a last &quot;adventure&quot; before starting his mondane grown up life.<br />
He is 1.80m caucasian with brown hair. If humans would have a character creator he would be the default character. No unique markings, not fat neither skinny, not ugly not handsome, 5/10 in everything.<br />
<br />
While he was on his journey he found himself in a small town, wandering on the streets to find a giftshop so he can buy himself a souvenir like he did in his previous destinations. That is when he saw The Magic Shop. The shop was nothing fancy, similar building like every other around it at the last street at the edge of the town, even the name &quot;The Magic Shop&quot;, like &quot;Why not named it something catchy?&quot; thought Jake, but that mondanity was that what made him decide to check it.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Good Day Lad! Can I help you with anything?&quot; asked the old shop owner.<br />
- &quot;Just looking around, thank you. replied Jake.&quot;<br />
- &quot;Well if you need anything just ask it.&quot; replied the owner and went back to finish his crosswords.<br />
<br />
There was a lot of strange things around the shop that interested Jake, but most of them was furnitures, clothes, or larger items that was way big for his backpack, not to mention these were not really souvenir materials. He was about to leave when he saw something glint from the corner of his eyes. When he approached it he saw some jewel boxes, with the same set of bracelet and ring. The set was looked nice and was not really expensive and because he wanted to get something from this town he decided to get them.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Ahhh a set of Walker jewels, both practical and nice looking, good choice, son.&quot; exclaimed hte owner.<br />
- &quot;Walker? I never heard of this brand, and what do you mean pracrical?&quot;<br />
- &quot;It let you become an... uber of sort, I think that is what you young ones call them instead of taxi.&quot;<br />
- &quot;I don&#39;t get it.&quot; said Jake with the most confused face he can put out.<br />
- &quot;It let you... walk in someone elses shoes... uhm and the other way around... you know what I will show it.&quot; tried to explain the owner and put on the same bracelet as Jake was holding. &quot;Go on put yours on too&quot;<br />
- &quot;Okay, so I would like to take control of your body for 5 minutes, no harm will be done for your body and I will not leave the shop. said the owner.<br />
Jake was surprised, he must be tired because he didn&#39;t seen the old mans mouth moving, but heard him not to mention what he said was nonsense.<br />
- &quot;Yeah, okay, sure.&quot; said Jake thinking the old man will do some cheap magic trick or something.<br />
- &quot;Alright than put on the ring.&quot; said the owner pointing to the box.<br />
<br />
As soon as the ring was reached the base of his middle finger, he felt a jolt of pain and saw as the old man lost consciousness, falling on the desk he stood behind.<br />
He tried to check if he is okay, called for him, but nothing happened. He was not able to speak nor move. He was frightened.<br />
Started panicking about what is going on when he suddenly started moving.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Relax kid, you are not in danger and you are not hallucinating, everything going as we talked about it.&quot;<br />
Jake heard a much deeper voice coming from... him? His mout was moving even tho he cant move anything. The voice sounded like the owner&#39;s, but something was odd of it.<br />
His body was stopped in front of a full length mirror. He saw a man around in his late 40s, big gut, hairy all over, balding head with a greying, bushy mustache in his clothes which was not able to contain the gut, giving him a belly peek.<br />
- &quot;We are merged for that 5 minutes we talked about. You see the body now resembles your and my characteristycs, while I am in control.&quot; said thethe body, him? The owner? Them?<br />
- &quot;You feel everything that your... well now our body does. With practice you will be able to telepathically talk to your... well partner.<br />
With that saidJake calmed down, yes what was happening to him is a total nonsense, but everything happening as the old guy said, that means in less than 4 minutes he will turn back, right?<br />
<br />
The body started moving again towards the desk, opening it. They picked out a pin and stabbed themself in the finger.<br />
<br />
With a surprised yell he was in control again. The owner slowly got up from the desk.<br />
- &quot;What happened? The 5 minutes was not up yet.&quot; asked Jake.<br />
- &quot;Our deal was included not harming your body, but I did harmed you with that pin making the deal invalid.&quot; explained the owner.<br />
<br />
Jake looked back at the mirror, watching himself turning back to his original self.<br />
- &quot;Depending on how long you was fused with your passenger, it could take a longer time to revert back to your original state.&quot; explained the owner while handing Jake the ring that fell off his finger.<br />
<br />
- &quot;That... I... How?&quot; stuttered Jake.<br />
- &quot;This is a magic shop, that was magic.&quot; said the old man in a bland voice. &quot;So are you interested buying them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not long after Jake left the shop checking the box with the bracelet and ring in it.<br />
He turned back realizing that probably everything was in the store magical, but the shop was gone.</p>
