<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Help didn&#39;t come. &quot;As you please, then, but I expect him to rejoin me posthaste.&quot; Chesh waved them away, happy to have the marten make problems elsewhere, tagging along with Haren to walk over to some of the other fancy-looking guests. Amure recognized some of them as diplomats he crossed paths with working for Chesh.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The marten dragged the tiger by the finger, leading him into one of the quieter, emptier rooms. Amure spoke calmly, feeling a little shy. &quot;You.... Mister Smith, mind explaining what I&#39;m here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s for you to figure out, my beautiful sir,&quot; Martingue said, practically salivating. Either at the body of the muscular man he’s speaking with, or at the thought of what he could do with him. &quot;But I&#39;m here to give you a quick rundown of what&#39;s going on. For example, you seemed blissfully unaware of the fact that you&#39;re an absolutely shredded tiger who&#39;s probably one of the tallest felines at this masquerade. Do you even know you have a tail?&quot;<br />
 <br />
This confused the tiger. The room around him seemingly getting even smaller, he looked down at his body, his striped pectorals obscuring the view of the rest. Turning his head back instead, he seemed to notice a tail flowing contently before coming to an abrupt stop. Wait... yeah, he wasn&#39;t always this way... but this feels so right...<br />
 <br />
The mustelid continued the exposition in a soft, British upper-class accent.<br />
&quot;Your name is also Amure Felinad, despite it being whatever it was before. This is who you are. This is what the masquerade is. Anything you say, about anyone, earnestly enough, is going to change them. For example...&quot; He takes a delightfully long dramatic pause, smiling to himself before pointing his best version of… seductive “fuck-me” eyes, at Amure.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;m just the perfect height to be able to suck off Amure Felinad&#39;s cock while we&#39;re both standing.&quot; He announces with a gleeful tone, his height practically shooting down to 3&#39;7&quot;, coming up to just about Amure&#39;s waist. &quot;Now, the more important part, is that you can change people&#39;s personality, clothing, relationships, sexual preferences... anything is fair game. And the later in the night we are, the easier it is for changes to take hold.&quot; Martingue takes another pause, smiling innocently before stating the following:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
&quot;My, your erection has been growing so large, you&#39;re such a horny tiger...&quot;<br />
 <br />
Amure, short-circuiting from the world-defying exposition thrown at him, complete with evidence, a bulge that has been steadily growing in his pants as Martingue hops over to nuzzle it with a suppressed giggle, the tiger tries to push out: &quot;M-m-m-m-y, thank you for telli-. ah, stop doing that-.&quot; He stammers as the marten teases his growing erection, who seems to oblige temporarily. &quot;Thank you for telling me this, this is... important, but why like this, and why... aah,&quot; Amure is silenced by the twink eloquently teasing him with a finger as a damp spot formed on the massive bulge, the bulge itself threatening to tear the pants they’ve been confined to.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
&quot;Now, I want everyone to have fun... and I want to have fun with you, you beautiful hunk... but I have a score to settle with our great noble friend. You see, last quarter, when the winds were extremely potent, he got especially upset at me and turned me into a plush toy. That he then had all of his friends ejaculate on me.&quot; Feeling a wave of changes start to creep up to himself, body beginning to turn into a plushified version of himself once more, he quickly catches himself in a half-panicked tone: &quot;I turned back, but I didn&#39;t exactly forgive him for it. I could feel everything, you know? He called me a... fertility idol, did some… unsavory thing on top of the aforementioned…&quot; Fur turning back to normal, he continues, hints of a blush showing through his fur… somehow.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
&quot;What&#39;s fair is fair, and what I think is fair, is that you and I team up together to teach him a lesson he will never forget, aye? Or, at least one that comes back to haunt us in the next quarter?&quot; He looked up at the tiger&#39;s face from his legs, finding only abs and pecs, then continued hugging Amure&#39;s crotch. &quot;If you need anything in return, and I mean anything, I am happy to oblige... you seem like you’re in need of a proper shagging,&quot; a muffled voice murmured from beneath Amure’s core. Proper. What a comforting word.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Amure stood there, his thinking slowed by Martingue&#39;s eager teasing. So... so much information. He could change anyone he wanted? And people could do the same to him? Gott, that&#39;s so hot... Did he want to agree to mess with Chesh? I mean, he&#39;s here to keep Chesh out of trouble... but he knows how the Prince has been looking at him, and he knows what kind of men he likes. And... didn&#39;t Chesh make him even larger by saying that he&#39;s imposing? Is Chesh really getting in trouble if he’s being supervised by a larger feline?<br />
 <br />
&quot;We can embarrass Prince Chesh as much as possible, but it has to be something he&#39;d enjoy.&quot; He replied. He thought that was a fair compromise between business and pleasure. He’d get slightly in trouble, but everyone would end up very satisfied. Gott, who was he kidding, he wanted to fuck someone so badly…<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Stars flew out of the marten&#39;s eyes as he pulled away from the tiger. &quot;Your cooperation makes me so happy, my German partner in crime... Now, here&#39;s something we can use - we CAN make changes behind people&#39;s backs, and as long as they&#39;re not told of the changes in their behaviour, they won&#39;t notice them, much.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Right, so, if I said that...&quot; Amure closed his eyes, and wished out: &quot;I am in a secret relationship with Prince Chesh. I easily know how to push his buttons, and he is incredibly submissive towards me if I do so.&quot; The lights in the room blacked out for a moment before returning to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grand, quite grand! That&#39;s exactly the sort of thing I am talking about, though I had something different in mind…&quot; the mustelid nodded eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we know it worked on both me and him?&quot; Amure asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, one could find the prince and see it for themselves, we could wait to see if any memories surfaced in your mind, or we could make another, tangential change. As in, I could transform into something to help facilitate the story you&#39;ve told me,&quot; the marten listed off the points on his 4-fingered paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is-. fuck, all of this is really making my brain hurt.&quot; So it was. &quot;Do you mind if we take a short break, and then… figure out what to do next? I&#39;m fine with waiting, this is just… so much for me.&quot; Amure sighed, ruffling Martingue&#39;s hair a little bit.<br />
<br />
They sat down on one of the marble benches near a window, the soft light of the full moon washing down their backs. The quiet room was slowly filling in with attendees, the once-quiet retreat turning into another buzzing antechamber.<br />
<br />
Amure was content to sit and wait, as he had said. He beckoned one of the servants over for a drink, then flinched as he felt the soft marten figure lean on him. Amure wrapped an arm around him, taking a sip of the alcohol, just listening to the transformative conversations of the crowd in front of him. A few minutes later, he heard the mustelid&#39;s voice.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for springing all of this on you, these events can be… hectic, and I didn&#39;t want you to be taken advantage of.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you taken advantage of me, in more than a way?&quot; The tiger took a sip. &quot;I&#39;m… hot and bothered because of you, you&#39;ve been changing me from the moment we&#39;ve met, and now I&#39;m helping you scheme the fucking of His Royal Majesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t want you to be taken advantage of by anyone else but me… I am a hypocrite, of sorts.&quot; The marten chuckled, rubbing his hand against the tiger&#39;s crotch. &quot;It&#39;s so fun to break-in newbies. And, seeing as you attached yourself to His Royal Majesty, I was afraid he&#39;d leave you with a… sour taste of festivities.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think you just want this footlong inside of you. And inside of Chesh. You&#39;ve been ogling my dick for the last three minutes. Of course you would, it&#39;s honestly amazing how my clothes stretch so well to show my erection.&quot; Starting to get the hang of how the masquerade works, he leaves a little trip for Martingue, and transforms his own clothes in a single go. <br />
<br />
The shaft that the twink was fondling steadily grew larger, now comfortably standing on display inside the stretchy fabric of the hunk&#39;s tuxedo. The twink himself, however, was seemingly mostly unchanged, if not for a blush starting to shine even brighter on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;A-ah, well… that&#39;s also true…&quot; the marten stuttered, eyes transfixed on the firm weapon beneath his hand.<br />
<br />
Amure just felt content to sit there, getting all the attention from the cute twink... Maybe not something he would normally enjoy, in whatever his past life was. Finishing his drink, he looked around the spacious room, sighing to himself. He had the rest of this weird, horny night for himself and for whomever he decided to spend it with. It&#39;d be nice to get around to some actual fucking, too, but this moment of sexually tense calmness was welcome, too. He heard music in a distant hall, saw people of all species grope one another... man, what sort of party has Chesh invited him to?...<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your occupation? I&#39;m afraid I never caught it,&quot; the tiger grinned, wrapping his large paw around the marten&#39;s much smaller one.<br />
<br />
“O-oh, it doesn’t really matter much. Um, a-aren’t you interested in breaking in the Prince? You&#39;ve been staring off at the room, is something on your mind? I thought we&#39;d get moving by now.” the mustelid shyly said.<br />
<br />
Ah. He’s being coy. That’s fun. Feeling a wave of lust wash through him, a desire to wrap the prince around his finger forming in the tiger’s mind, he stops to think for a moment. The prince is so far away, and the marten is right there… and his sharp eyes spot a lonely, shy looking figure in the corner of the room just holding a glass of punch awkwardly. Conflicting feelings raged within him - his brain trying to accept this horny brand of magic, his feelings for Chesh, the state of arousal,  sheer exhaustion and headache slowing down his thoughts... <br />
<br />
&quot;I... ugh, this really hasn&#39;t helped me get anything out of my system. Can&#39;t you say something like... to make it easier for me? There&#39;s so much I want to do, but I feel... blergh.&quot; Amure replied, petting the mustelid on his fluffy head, getting some very adorable flustered noises out of the marten.<br />
<br />
Martingue looked up at him, face slightly saddened by the fact that Amure seems out of it still. He pulled his hands away from the tiger, crossing them as he pondered how to make Amure feel better. &quot;I suppose we could, yes. That would help move things along, surely we don&#39;t want you to be somber or hesitant the whole night.&quot; He stood up, then climbed onto the tiger&#39;s legs, staring directly into his face. &quot;You seem so relaxed. You&#39;ve been taking all of this so well. Your headache looks like it&#39;s gone, too.&quot; The tiger&#39;s body softened, tension from his muscles releasing. His head felt clearer, his thoughts on the night turning into mostly positive ones. This WAS an opportunity to try some magical things, wasn&#39;t it? And everyone does seem to be enjoying themselves... <br />
<br />
Adding in a little bit of extra from himself, the marten said, lustfully: &quot;And you seem so dominant. My, I can see why some of the shorter guys here couldn&#39;t keep their eyes off of you - you just seem so confident and masculine. And your smell... I think a good whiff of your... aroma, is enough to turn any man mightily submissive and breedable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck... that&#39;s a lot of changes. That twink knew what he was doing, though. Amure felt... on top of the world. Blood rushing through his body, he took Martingue in his arms by the chest. Martingue was so... small, precious... and light. It was like holding a grape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so? You&#39;ll be the first to experience it at this party, then.&quot; Shoving the marten&#39;s face into his armpits, holding it in place for a good ten seconds. At first, the small man resisted, sounding indignantly. Then, his pathetic flailing subsided, words of complaint being replaced by flustered stammering. Then, that was gone too. All that was left were the soft moans of a submissive twink. Pulling Martingue&#39;s face away from his pits, he put him back down on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that good, puppy?&quot; Amure asked, tilting his head sideways as he asked the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y--asdjgaargdlrjgasdwererls-. y-yes, s-sir...&quot; the bashful, soft voice gibbered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I don&#39;t appreciate you messing with me over the last hour... So I ought to teach you a lesson, haven&#39;t I?&quot; The tiger stood up, his junk on level with the marten&#39;s face. Amure shoved the mustelid&#39;s tomato-red face into his crotch. Some of the people in the room gasped, most others looked on in knowing, content arousal. &quot;So, let&#39;s start with something simple... my, did you leave your glasses on the bench? I could&#39;ve sworn I saw large, round, nerdy goggles on you... you can hardly see without them, can&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The glasses appeared on the marble bench they were sitting on. The twink, too aroused to resist the tiger&#39;s words, just tried to nod from under Amure&#39;s arm. Amure lightly shoved the twink&#39;s head away, walking to the bench, picking up the glasses and then kneeling down in front of Martingue to put them on his adorable little face.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that red leather collar suits you so well, pet. I&#39;m so glad Prince Chesh allowed me to bring my property here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martingue, feeling a firm collar forming around his neck, might as well have been on the verge of passing out from how much blood was pumping to his dick. He... gods, Master was so hot... was this really how he expected this evening to go? He was pulled from his thoughts by the tiger lightly tugging at his leash, who was already a couple of feet away. He felt so grateful that Amure returned his glasses, he really couldn&#39;t see past his elbow without them...<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop daydreaming, slut. We&#39;ve got royalty to meet, be on your best behavior.&quot; Amure sneered at the flustered mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Although, actually... I feel like you haven&#39;t learned your lesson yet, puppy. How about... Ah,&quot; the tiger knelt down again, looking down at the marten&#39;s crotch, the pet&#39;s large shaft sliding down to his knee under his pants. Damn, proportionally it was... huge. &quot;There&#39;s your problem, not enough blood in your brain, you&#39;re doing too much thinking with your dick.&quot; Amure paused, just sighing at this. His pet was such a nuisance at times. &quot;Now, I shouldn&#39;t be making excuses for you. Your sensitive little dick is hardly two inches long, how much blood could reasonably flow there?&quot; <br />
<br />
The marten stammered in shock, his shaft sliding back up until it looks like there&#39;s just a small bump on the bottom&#39;s pants, clarity returning to his mind. Not waiting for him to give a response, Amure stood back up and started walking away, looking for Chesh. Martingue followed behind. He felt owned in every way, and very... happy with that idea. Of course he was Master&#39;s loyal pet. He lived for him, loved him, would do anything for him... whatever he did to him, that was fine. Master knew better.</p>
