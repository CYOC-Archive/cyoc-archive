<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three fifty PM came as it normally did and William left the classroom with some feelings of calm. Normally, he might stay a bit longer to either deal with any assignments that had been turned in or make sure his specific lectures were in order. However, for the moment things were fairly good in that regard and he had the Skulk&#39;s pre-Halloween meeting to attend. That would mean having to leave earlier than normal, but he felt things were ready. With that, he placed what he needed to in his office and even left his briefcase in his office. With that, he then began to make his way out. As he came out, he came across another werefox that was in the English department.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, Professor Anderson,&quot; the other werefox spoke, adjusting her blouse to keep it straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, Professor McCall,&quot; William answered with a small nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for your first Skulk meeting?&quot; McCall inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so... though I&#39;m not sure on how much I can really contribute, I&#39;ve never been to one before,&quot; William answered with a shrug, &quot;though I&#39;d also imagine the Harper/Jenkins wedding will probably dominate the agenda.&quot;<br />
<br />
McCall nodded in agreement, &quot;given things... you&#39;re probably right, but normally we do talk about a fair amount of fun things besides. It&#39;ll be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
William slowly nodded as they moved to head down the stairs toward the first floor. They walked along quietly, though since Martha had the car, William didn&#39;t walk into the parking lot and remained on the sidewalk. McCall glanced to see him walking and then called to him<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need a ride, Professor Anderson?&quot; McCall asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re offering,&quot; William answered, &quot;it&#39;d save on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then jogged over and climbed into the passenger seat beside McCall. He looked to her as she backed her car backward. While like all female werefoxes she was beautiful, though much like Akane no Tachibana, she was older and had aged quite well. He figured that McCall was happily married to someone and had a bond to that person, just as he was bonded to Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, will I get to meet your wife at the meeting, or does she have den work to do?&quot; McCall asked as they drove along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Den work?&quot; William wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the only time Skulk members are excused is when there is a family issue... sickness, giving birth to kits, or confronting death in the family... and so on,&quot; McCall answered, &quot;we call it den work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... no, Martha should be there,&quot; William answered, &quot;and while she is a werecat... she&#39;s very smart and kind. If there is anything we need to do for Jenny Harper&#39;s happiness, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d have a good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
McCall nodded and accepted directions from William on the route to the Anderson home. As she pulled up to the front of the Anderson home, McCall looked over to William as he got out.<br />
<br />
&quot;While we&#39;re in different dens, I&#39;ll look forward to meeting your wife then,&quot; McCall said with a friendly smile, &quot;though my husband might enjoy that more. My Timothy is a male werecat and turns into a Spanish Lynx... very handsome. He and your wife would probably have a lot to talk about once all the official business is completed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; William answered and then moved to head in.<br />
<br />
He returned to find Eric and Julie sprawled out on the floor working on their homework at the moment while Nate and Alex were seated on the couch and looking over their own homework. All appeared to be diligently working and they didn&#39;t even notice his return at first. It was only when the door clicked shut that the study group looked up from the floor or the couch to notice that William had come home. He gave a small smile as he came into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d thought everyone would have headed out to rush to the weekend as soon as they got home from school,&quot; William gave a small chuckle, &quot;but it would appear that we have a host of scholars here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d actually be my fault,&quot; came Martha&#39;s voice from behind him, &quot;I got home a little while ago and everyone was getting ready to head out for their respective nights out. I asked everyone to stay until you came home so that we can coordinate things for tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This relates to the wedding... right?&quot; Nate asked from the couch.<br />
<br />
William nodded, &quot;Yes... we were invited as a family, so it would make sense to show up together as a family. Even if you aren&#39;t completely familiar with Jennifer Harper or Harold Jenkins, it would make sense that we show up together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have no problems with you enjoying some time with your friends and loves,&quot; Martha added, &quot;but it&#39;d be best to coordinate things together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that my dad was also invited in his role as Mayor and in a sense to give Moon Lake&#39;s official &quot;apology&quot; for the fact that Ms. Harper was clawed by a rogue,&quot; Julie commented, &quot;I&#39;ve heard my parents talking about the wedding from time to time, though that could also be administrative and safety concerns that my dad has...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; William asked to Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know for sure... if it&#39;s only security concerns, it would mean that our family wasn&#39;t invited,&quot; Julie admitted, &quot;I can ask my dad when he comes home and then call here after I get the answer. You do have an answering machine?&quot;<br />
<br />
William and Martha both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll call,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;if we are to attend as the mayor&#39;s family in an official capacity we can bring Eric over together. If not, we&#39;d be able to let you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; William commented, &quot;Well... if it turns out that your family isn&#39;t invited, Martha and I will be by about seven fifty to be on time for the first ceremony at eight o&#39;clock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our family wasn&#39;t invited,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;but I think we can get Nate ready before then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try to come back before you guys are ready to go,&quot; Nate said to his parents, though his voice sounded a bit frustrated with that sort of situation. The situation was a tough one. He still supported the idea that more civic duty could be done for the Jenkins/Harper wedding and he personally wasn&#39;t opposed to providing it. At the same time he also wanted to spend time with Alex as well. He looked over to see Eric looking like he was between being downcast and looking to Julie with some nervousness. It was like he was also aware of the problems that were in the background with the wedding. That there could be trouble at the second ceremony because of troublemakers from outside Moon Lake, while at the same time wishing to be with the one he loved. In a way it was a tremendous push and pull that would have to be balanced.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be good,&quot; William spoke, &quot;and from there... we&#39;ll let you both be free to head home or back to Julie and Alex after the first ceremony. We won&#39;t hold you to be there for the second ceremony which could have the potential for danger and real fireworks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That way you&#39;ll be safe and we as a family can continue to integrate into Moon Lake beyond the immediate friends and so on,&quot; Martha added. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard or too long and you&#39;ll be free to get yourselves ready for the Halloween Dance. I know a lot of this is hectic... but it&#39;s generally going to be hectic for all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Julie and Eric both agreed with Julie taking Eric&#39;s hand with some unsaid assurance that things would be fine. Eric felt that assurance and then nodded. After all, if Martin Stovall was invited as Moon Lake&#39;s Mayor, that could well mean that his family would come for at least the first ceremony. It might mean an early morning, but being by Julie&#39;s side would be more than enough for the start.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be safe at the second ceremony,&quot; Nate said to his parents. He privately supposed he could make do with the first ceremony, but the second one and the potential confrontation with the Harper family and this Alabama &quot;big-wig&quot; was enough to make him nervous. Volunteering to help provide extra security had been his idea, and a part of him figured to actually try it if the city government would have allowed at. A part of him still felt it might do for civic duty to provide some help. But, Ben had said that City Hall was only accepting volunteers over eighteen years in age and that didn&#39;t mean that the overall situation wasn&#39;t dangerous or at least had the potential to be dangerous.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will... though I think enough security is going to be surrounding the church that things will be fine in the end,&quot; William answered, &quot;and a lot of tonight&#39;s meeting will probably deal with the Skulk&#39;s plan for it...&quot;</p>
