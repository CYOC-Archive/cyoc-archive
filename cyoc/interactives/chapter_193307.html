<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Officer Jerry Turner entered his SUV a new man, a changed man. He started his vehicle and drove back home after his haircut session; all the while he looked out at the streets, he saw the place where he needed to carry out his duty, to live up to the things Sarge had shown him: that he had to serve and protect. He arrived at the house and pulled in the driveway as he had done before, but even here at home Jerry now knew he had to change, had to show a sense of love and loyalty to his family, something he had not always shown before he met Sarge.<br />
He entered through the front door and stepped down to the living room where his family sat.<br />
  “Dad!!!”, his youngest son Kyle shouted upon seeing his father. He hopped from the couch and the TV programs and headed to his father. Jerry knelt down and waited for his son to reach him; the boy threw his arms around his father once he got to him.<br />
  “Watch the hair, Kyle. I gotta keep this for work Monday.”, he warned his rambunctious 3rd grader of a son.<br />
  “I like it, Dad. You look cooler than the cops on TV.”, Kyle smiled.<br />
  “Yeah, because a former Marine cut it. So, it’s more cop meets soldier.”<br />
  “So does this mean you’re going to go out for SWAT then?” Justin, his middle son, cracked from the couch, looking on at his father and little brother.<br />
  “Nah, I’m staying on the beat; your dad is not going out for anything that exciting.” He cracked a wry smile as he thought of his fellow officers transformed like him, uniformed like him and in formation all together. Jerry looked over at Raymond, his eldest son, sitting on the couch, still watching TV to avoid the conversation. “Any thoughts, Ray?”, Jerry asked to draw his son in.<br />
  The eldest son tried to ignore the conversation, but he heard his father call him “Ray”, the form of his name used back when he was in junior high like his brother. Back when they were on better terms; back before Ray got involved in the anti-police protest movement and when he could look at his father in his uniform with some degree of respect.<br />
  Jerry could see the hesitation in his eldest son’s refusal to talk; he chose his next words to draw his oldest boy in. “You’d actually like the former Marine who cut my hair. He let me have it a little bit about my conduct.”<br />
  That comment, as Jerry hoped, drew his son’s gaze from the TV over to him. “What did he have to say?”<br />
  “He suggested that cops should try a little harder to live up to the uniforms we wear.” Jerry paused before he continued. “The haircut is me taking his advice.”<br />
  The final part made Ray look over to see his father’s new haircut. “Not bad.”, the teenager commented.<br />
  “I can live with that,” his father replied, nodding that his eldest son accepted the haircut.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Dinner on the final weeknight of his vacation went well for Jerry; he felt the conversation with his wife and sons came easy. He was engaged, listening to what they had to say and responding back with ease and truthfulness. Even with his eldest boy Ray, Jerry could listen to him without getting angry like he had before he went to Sarge’s. Where a normal dinner lasted no longer than 30 minutes, the family sat around the table, talking and enjoying each other’s company for an hour and a half before they got up and started cleaning up.<br />
  After dinner they continued spending time together as a family until it was time to go to bed. Jerry, all the while, could only trace this back to Sarge and his haircut. He thought he should thank Sarge somehow as he got ready for bed. With night clothes on, Officer Jerry Turner got into bed beside his wife. Laying his head on the pillow, he found himself feeling the same pleasure he had while sitting in Sarge’s chair. He thought back to Sarge’s shop and the transformation and closed his eyes. As he drifted off to sleep, a thought crossed Jerry’s mind: What if all the guys at the station had this feeling and could wear the uniform Sarge had made him? The thought pleased Jerry and made his penis rise a bit as he relaxed. And as he entered his first dream, the thought of all the officers of the station wearing the guardsman’s uniform extended to include his boys.<br />
	<br />
<br />
        Officer Turner looked at his phone while he waited for his partner to come out the restaurant. 1:10pm, Tuesday afternoon. There was time to stop by Sarge’s shop and introduce Gabe to Sarge. He unlocked the phone and texted Sarge.<br />
	[Turner]You in the shop?  <br />
	[Sarge]On the way back. Be there in 5.<br />
	[Turner]Wanna bring my partner by. Get the process started.<br />
	[Sarge]Come through.<br />
	Turner saw the go-ahead just as Gabe came walking through the front door.<br />
	“I wanna make a quick stop before we get back on patrol.”<br />
	“Where we headed to?”, Gabe asked, unsure of what his partner had in mind.<br />
	“To the barber shop where I got this cut; I want you to meet the guy who did it and see if he’ll hook you up in the future.”<br />
	“Sounds good.”<br />
	With that, the pair enter the patrol SUV and headed to Sarge’s shop.<br />
	“An ex-military guy hooked you up, Turner? No wonder why your cut’s up to code.”<br />
	“Former military; ex would mean he was dishonorably discharged. He’s a good guy, too.”<br />
	Turner opened the door, letting Gabe walk into Sarge’s shop.<br />
	“Officer Turner, I didn’t expect to see you back so soon.”<br />
	“Well, I wanted to stop by and introduce my partner to you before we get back on patrol. Sarge, this is my partner, Gabriel Nielsen. Gabe, this is former Gunnery Sergeant William Keegan.”<br />
	“Officer Nielsen, it’s good to meet you.” Sarge walked over to Jerry and Gabriel and shook Gabriel’s hand.<br />
	“Likewise…hmm…how should I address you?”<br />
	“Sarge is where most people land; it has the mix of formal title and relaxed demeanor. I hope like with Officer Turner you’ll be a regular.”<br />
	Sarge put the push on the “regular.” Turner looked over at his partner and could see when the push hit. It was one thing to feel Sarge’s push hit you; now Turner could see his partner feel and then come under the push.<br />
	“Regular…”, Gabe began in a monotone voice. “I can come through on a regular basis.”<br />
	“Of course, you can, Gabe.” Turner chimed in; he wanted to play his part in the transformation of his partner. “In fact, why don’t you come back this Saturday at 1? I’ll bring my boys to meet Sarge then.” Sarge followed Turner’s lead and pushed for Gabe to come back on Saturday. “Yes, we can all let Sarge make us presentable.”, Gabe chimed back.<br />
	Turner grinned at the push working on his partner. He couldn’t contain himself. Physically a bulge in his crotch grew as Sarge pushed and began the process of making his partner a guardsman like him. The anticipation of seeing his partner transforming into what he himself was now swept over him; it wasn’t enough to just see Sarge begin the changes, he had to play a part. He had to tell his partner what was waiting for him. He went behind his partner’s back and began to whisper in his ear, telling of the changes that awaited him Saturday, of the guardsman uniform Sarge would create for him, of the pleasure that would come as he let Sarge make him over. Sarge couldn’t hear what Turner was saying but he could see the physical signs of anticipation and he let Gabe feel the same anticipation. The pushes came through Gabe, creating the image of what would happen Saturday: the cutting of his golden brown hair, the transformation of his clothes into the guardsman’s uniform, the conditioning of his mind. Gabe saw himself and Turner standing in their uniforms together; himself fully conditioned. The anticipation swelled over him and he too like his partner now sported an erection that all could see. “I can’t wait…I can’t wait for Saturday… to become the guardsman and officer… to let Sarge make me a guardsman.” That was music to Turner’s ear. It was why he brought his partner to Sarge.<br />
	Sarge had gotten Gabe ready for his appointment Saturday; he felt the guy needed to calm down before going back on patrol.<br />
	“Reign in that anticipation, Officer Nielsen; remember a guardsman puts his job and duty above his emotion.”<br />
	The accompanying push got Gabe to start taking breaths to calm his anticipation. Inhaling and exhaling led to the physical and emotional anticipation subsiding and Gabe getting himself under control. Sarge pushed Gabe back to the state when he came in.<br />
	“We better get back to the cruiser and get ready to start our patrol.” Turner began. Gabe came out of Sarge’s pushes and back into the shop. He looked at the digital clock on Sarge’s wall. “Yeah, it’s almost time. But thanks, Sarge, for taking the time to meet with me. It was a great inspiration for me, and I’ll see you Saturday.”<br />
	“Sure, I’ll have everything ready for when you come.”, Sarge replied. <br />
	Turner flashed Sarge a wry smile and a casual salute as he headed out the door. Sarge merely nodded his acknowledgment.<br />
	Turner and Nielsen got into the cruiser and drove away from Sarge’s shop.<br />
<br />
<br />
	Officer Turner felt a bit of déjà-vu; he had been down this road, driving to Sarge’s shop to get a haircut. But this time it was Saturday instead of Friday and his three sons were riding along with him. It had been a boys’ day out and this was the final stop. This time he had to park down the street from the shop, not in front of it. Ray helped Kyle get down from his booster seat while Justin slid across the back seat and got out the car once Kyle was out. Turner walked around the car and led the trio of boys back down the line of storefronts to the door of Sarge’s shop.<br />
	Justin opened the door for Kyle to run through; on the other side Justin and Kyle saw Sarge sitting in the barber’s chair talking with Gabe who was sitting in one of the waiting chairs.<br />
	“Uncle Gabriel!!”, Kyle cried out before he started to run to Turner’s partner.<br />
        “Gabriel’s here?”, Ray asked as he turned to look at his father, trying to figure out what was going on.<br />
        “He decided to come get his hair cut once I told him about Sarge; I thought it would be a good time to introduce you guys to him.”<br />
         Ray glared at his father, not believing his explanation, but he couldn’t do anything about it as Sarge was out the barber chair, kneeling down to shake Kyle’s hand. He walked over behind Justin as Sarge reached out and shook his younger brother’s hand.<br />
         “I’m Raymond, but my friends call me Ray.” Ray took the initiative and introduced himself first.<br />
         “William Keegan, former Marine Gunnery Sergeant, but everybody calls me Sarge.” Sarge shook Ray’s hand. “Kyle must be a handful at times.”<br />
          “Yeah, he can be, but I’m used to it now. Plus, Justin helps out too so it’s not so much work.”<br />
            Sarge ushered the boys and their father to customer chairs. They talked and as they talked Sarge prepped Gabe and the boys with pushes throughout the conversation. He didn’t have to push too hard to make Kyle and Justin ready, they were already willing to get their hair cut by him. With Ray, Sarge had to ease his suspicion, which he did through his words and demeanor along with a few pushes at only crucial points. Gabe only needed to be put back into the state he was in Tuesday, but not to the extent that he was aroused and sporting an erection that the boys could see.<br />
           The conversation continued until Turner suddenly realized that Gabe and the boys were quiet and sitting up with their hands on their knees. He turned to look at Sarge.<br />
           “Are you sure you want me to do this to your boys?”, Sarge asked, the concern about Turner’s wish was all too apparent.<br />
           “I’m not asking you to erase who they are, but to add the honor of guardsmen to them. Merely to improve them like you improved me.”<br />
            Sarge hesitated a bit; he didn’t see the corruption in Turner’s boys like he saw in the man himself. Even Gabe wasn’t as bad as Turner was since they had only been partners for a couple of years. Sarge was torn about going forward. But he closed his eyes, let a sigh out, and resigned himself to doing what Turner asked. <br />
            One by one he cut their hair. Kyle’s sandy-blond hair he shaped in a classic quaff, combing the hair back but tapering the side and back rather than fading them; Kyle was truly pleased with his haircut. Justin got a flattop with tapering much like his brother. (Sarge couldn’t bring himself to go with fades on the side and back for the boys.) Once Sarge was finished, he showed his work to Justin, which got a “Nice” from the middle brother.<br />
            “It’s a cooler, younger version of a Marine flattop.”, Sarge explained.<br />
            “Awesome!! Thanks, Sarge!!”<br />
             The enthusiasm eased the hesitance Sarge felt a bit. For Ray, he cut and shaped his hair into a combover with a part on the left and tapered all around. And finally, Gabe got an Ivy League cut that was faded.<br />
             All four sat back down, waiting for the next part. Sarge led them all into the back. On top of the table were five piles of clothing, shoes, and caps. Each one stood next to the pile designated for them. Once all were in position, Sarge went down the line transform the clothing and shoes into duplicates of what they all were wearing. When Sarge came to Turner, he was met with a puzzled look on the cop’s face. <br />
             “Don’t act like you don’t want to wear the uniform with your boys and your partner.” Sarge conveyed the statement via a push before duplicating the clothes Turner was wearing. “Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get to what you want to see, Officer Turner.” Officer Turner grinned as Sarge turned and walked away.<br />
               Sarge walked down the line and pushed the command to wear the caps to everyone but Turner. With the caps on, Sarge stopped in front of Kyle. He turned and faced the youngest boy and began morphing his attire into the black woolen uniform with grey trim just like his father’s that fit him perfectly. The one change Sarge made was in the boots, giving the boy jump boots instead of bal-laced boots. Mentally he explained the meaning of the uniform and encouraged Kyle to develop and maintain the positive traits. Sarge repeated the process for his older brothers. He then walked to Gabe and began his transformation. Sarge felt better transforming Gabe physically and mentally. Gabe wasn’t as corrupt as Turner so transforming him into a guardsman was easier. Gabe stood next to his partner in the guardsman uniform.<br />
                 Sarge finally returned to Turner; he could see the excitement on his face and running through his body. “Remember what I told your partner the other day, Officer Turner.”, Sarge warned while pushing his mind to remember.<br />
                “Reign in anticipation.”, Turner began in a monotone voice. “A guardsman puts his job and duty above his emotion.”<br />
                “True,” Sarge replied, “but duty can lead to pleasure, like it will now, Officer.”<br />
                 Sarge began to transform Turner’s clothes back into the guardsman’s uniform. Turner closed his eyes and felt the fabric shifting back into the uniform that his partner and his sons were wearing too. When the fabric stopped shifting, he knew that he and his partner were now the same and his sons now understood him by wearing the same uniform as he did.<br />
                “Well, Officer Turner”, Sarge began. “Would you like to inspect my work and see if it meets your… vision?”<br />
Officer Turner couldn’t help but smile. “Yes, Sir, Sarge!!”<br />
                “Then have at it, Officer.”<br />
                 Officer Turner walked over and faced his partner; he began to ask the same questions Sarge asked him.<br />
                 “Who are you?”<br />
                 “Officer Gabriel Nielsen, working out of the 74th Street Division.”<br />
                 “What are you wearing?”<br />
                 “An Honor Guardsman’s uniform.”<br />
                 “Why are you wearing that uniform?”<br />
                 “Because it represents the professionalism of a police officer. I wear it because I have pride in being a police officer. I wear it because I have the integrity and honor that comes with this uniform.”<br />
                 Turner’s smile was beaming as his partner was now just like him. He reached out his hand to his partner; Gabriel took his hand and shook it with pride. They pulled each other in and hugged.<br />
                Turner then moved on to his boys, all of whom stood at ease.<br />
                “What are you wearing?”<br />
                “An Honor Guardman’s uniform.”<br />
                “Why are you wearing that uniform?”<br />
                “Because we have the character to wear it.”, they began to explain. “We have pride in ourselves and our community. We are responsible, upright, capable of leading. We have integrity and honor, and we will continue to develop these traits as we wear the uniform.”<br />
                 Turner nodded upon hearing the answer that his boys gave. He knelt down on his right knee and extended his arms out; the boys went over and hugged him, which he returned to all three.<br />
                 Sarge, for his part, looked at Turner and his boys as he leaned against the far wall of the back room. When he began the transformations, Sarge wasn’t for changing the boys; they were nothing like their father. Even Officer Nielsen wasn’t as rogue as Turner. Sarge feared Turner was a monster he had set loose on the city. But now seeing Turner hugging and bonding with his boys, Sarge knew his initial fear was no longer needed. In fact, now that the boys were in the same shape as their father, they could bring him younger recruits who definitely needed to be corrected. Sarge headed back into the shop. “I’ll leave you guys to change.”, Sarge announced before going through the door into the shop.<br />
                 Sarge sat in the barber chair with his eyes closed, waiting for Turner, Nielsen and the boys to come into the shop. “You asleep, Sarge?”, Gabe asked.<br />
                “Just thinking with my eyes closed.”, Sarge explained as he opened his eyes to see all five changed back into the clothes they came into the shop in, carrying the garment and boot bags he had made for them. “Let me get something for you boys.” Sarge walked over to the cabinet beside his workstation, reached in and pulled out three large coins. He stacked them in his palm and closed his hand to reshape them. When he opened his hand, the coins were transformed into coins the size of a larger half-dollar that were gold like the current dollar coins in circulation, and octagonal like the Susan B. Anthony dollars. He walked over to the boys with his hand out. <br />
                “I want you to take one coin each.” He began to explain. Each brother took one. “Your dad runs into bad guys; every now and then he brings them to me, and I correct the badness out of them. I think that you three can do something similar. I want you to be on the lookout for the bad kids in your school. When you see them, all you gotta do is have them look at the coin I gave you. It won’t change them; it’ll mark them for me, your dad, and your uncle Gabriel. Your dad and uncle Gabriel will speak with them and bring them to me. Once you’ve shown them the coin, tell your dad and your dad and uncle Gabriel will let me know. You think you can do that?”<br />
                 The three boys nodded; “I think we can, Sarge.” Ray spoke for all three brothers. “We’ll do our best.” <br />
                 “Sounds good. Thanks for coming out; I’ll see you again when you guys need another haircut.”<br />
                 The three brothers, without prompting, all saluted Sarge; Sarge smiled and returned the salute. Sarge walked with everyone, seeing them out of the shop. Sarge waved as Gabriel waved and turned to head to his car. Turner was about to leave with the boys when Sarge stopped him and pulled a coin like the ones his sons got from Sarge. “I figure you’ll want to spend some time in uniform with your boys. You’ll need this to keep this out of your wife’s view, if you catch my drift.”<br />
                  Turner took the coin and put it in his pocket. “Thanks, Sarge. You could’ve said no to my request to make the boys junior guardsmen, but you went ahead with it.”<br />
                  “I was regretting it at the start, but it worked out in the end. All’s well that ends well, I guess.”<br />
                 “So, what’s the plan for the kids the boys find?”<br />
                 “They’ll be your explorers. You and Officer Nielsen should be able to get them into good shape to be future police officers, don’t you think?”<br />
                 “I do, Sarge, I do.”<br />
                 “Well, you better get home with those boys.”<br />
                 “See you sometime soon, Sarge.”<br />
                  Sarge nodded in agreement. He stood in front of the shop and watched Turner and the boys walk down to their SUV and get into the car. The black Acura pulled out into traffic and drove away. Sarge walked back into the barber shop, locked the door, and began to close the shop up for the day.<br />
