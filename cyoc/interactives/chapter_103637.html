<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the clock was ringing, Thomas was the last human being in his house. His father and his older brother had turned into dogs. He hugged them with a few tears on his face.<br />
&quot;I will help you.&quot; He said. &quot;I promise.&quot;<br />
A second later, a cat crossed near the window and Howard saw it. His new canine mind prompted him to pursuit it and bark. George was surprised, because even if he was a dog now, he didn&#39;t feel the need to do it. Instead, he slowly got close to his father and stroke him with his head. He thought that his father could react to this and recover some of his human mind, but he didn&#39;t expect that Howard started to smell his butt like regular dogs use to do.<br />
&quot;I think dad&#39;s mind is more canine than yours, George.&quot; Thomas said. &quot;I know you want to help, so I count on you for the dog&#39;s things.&quot;<br />
George nodded while he was feeling how his father was smelling his butt. He wondered how does it smell. Maybe dog&#39;s butts have a different smell. He felt the impulse to do it and he smelled his father&#39;s butt in response. He realized his dog&#39;s nose let him to feel a lot more essences than his human one. But, he knew that he would need to control those dog&#39;s feelings if he want to keep his human mind. He was too Deep on his thoughts that he didn&#39;t see that Thomas had left the room.<br />
He tried to find his little brother, so he started to look in other romos, but he wasn&#39;t able to find him. So, he remembered his new nose abilities. He started to sniff the floor, some essences were hard to know what they are, but he was able to identify his father essence, human and dog, his own former human essence and Thomas&#39; one. But, oddly, his little brother essence was fading on that room. It was replaced by a new essence that was familiar but unknown to him at same time. He thought that the better way to know where does that smell was coming from was to follow it. Without taking his nose out of the carpet, he followed the trail to the bathroom. It was closed and he had lost his capability to open doors, so he started to scratch it and bark instead.<br />
When the door opened, he saw Thomas leaving the bathroom with some pain on his body. He thought that maybe his little brother was turning into a dog too, so he stepped back to give free space to his brother. But, Thomas wasn&#39;t showing any sign of turning into a dog. Instead, Thomas was covered in some dazzling light, it looked like magic.<br />
Thomas&#39; pain was too strong that he felt on a couch. He felt like he was on fire, burning all his body, even his bones. His skins was turning from a pale white to a bronze tan. It was like he has been baked or something like that.<br />
Then, his clothes burst out all of a sudden like if they were made of paper, leaving Thomas almost naked except for his flip flops. But, those were the ones which were changing at that moment. His toes were the ones that changed first, they started to elongate, becoming bigger and in some way, older. On the other side, his heels moved back, distancing from the flip flops base. At some point, his feet were way too big that his flip flops&#39; lace didn&#39;t handle it and busted. George realize that the smell he was sniffing was coming from his brother feet, which now smelled like smelly cheese or something like that.<br />
&quot;My feet!&quot; Thomas screamed. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot;<br />
Then, George saw how his brother was growing on the couch, his legs and arms becoming longer, his chest becoming wider and his face maturing. After that, some muscles started to built on his frame, Quadriceps and calves on his legs, deltoids, biceps and triceps on his arms. His shoulders becoming wider and wider as time passed. On, his chest, pecs and abs were doing their on way in growing. Finally, Thomas looked way more buffed that how his former brother was when he was human.<br />
&quot;I feel heavy...&quot; Thomas said, but he stopped as he felt his neck thicking. His adam&#39;s apple started to grow until he got a deeper voice, very similar to his brother&#39;s former one.<br />
The small amount of body hair on him started to develop thicker and abundant on him, on his arms, legs, chest, armpits and genitals, but after they reached their maximum length, they receeded back until Thomas hadn&#39;t any except for the one over his head and over his dick.<br />
About his dick, it started to pump like a balloon until it was like a banana, some veins appeared on him and his foreskin grew back. His testicles grew until they were as big as lemons and developed a thick pubic hair.<br />
During a brief moment, some weird tattoos appeared over him, a skull on fire over his left pec and a thorn chain surrounding his right arm. But they dissappeared almost inmediatly after they appeared. Instead, Thomas started to cry when he felt a needle pain on his dick&#39;s head. A weird metal lace came out from his meatus and circled his dick&#39;s head until it returned to his initial point, piercing his foreskin at the time. It turned into a Prince Albert which shined as if it was magical. George can read &quot;Loki&quot; written on it.<br />
Finally, Thomas new huge package started to be covered on some kind of black leather fabric. It turned into a very small thong that didn&#39;t hide very well Thomas&#39; endowment.<br />
Thomas let out a big sigh of relief and he stayed immobible for some minutes. George get close to him and saw how his brother had changed into some kind of hunk, model or pornstar.<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Thomas said as he recovered himself. &quot;What happened to me?! I look like a jock or something like that!&quot;<br />
He screamed. He tried to stand up, but he lost his balance and he fell on the floor. Howard get close to him and take his opportunity to lick the odoroust feet who Thomas had now. This feeling was making Thomas too aroused and after some seconds he lost his control and shot, but nothing than an air jet came out from his dick which swayed his small thong and the balls inside of it. Thomas tried to stand up again and then he ran to the bathroom. He didn&#39;t recognized himself and tried to cry, but then he saw his brother and father entering the room and he remembered that he need to be strong even if he has this bigger body.<br />
&quot;I need clothes!&quot; He said and ran to his room to look for something to wear, but his clothes were too small for him now. So, he went to his father room, but his father was a short man and his clothes didn&#39;t fit him. At that time, George arrived the room with the clothes he was wearing before he turned into a dog on his mouth. Thomas knew that his brother was giving them to him and he accepted the offer. But, when he started to get his pants on, he heard a loud scream.<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Thomas said and then he ran outside his house to look what&#39;s going on.</p>
