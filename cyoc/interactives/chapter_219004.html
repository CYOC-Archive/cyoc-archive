<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Bob, new that he wanted this life to be different, and did not want to end up in prison again like where his old body is right now, and looked at himself, he knew he could work with this, he looked very innocent and cute, and new he could grow up to be good looking,  and well he knew he needed to stay in school this time around, not even being able to read or write that great. <br />
<br />
And looking at this kids, now his body he wondered the age for this kid, he must be over 10 with already having fun on dirty websites, but  while he was taking a berth and exploring his new body, it still looked like a child&#39;s and not a teen, so he must be around 10 or 11 now, I guess that makes sense with the tank top he had on now saying “Size: child 10” on the label and he could not trust these shorts he was looking down at with them being pretty loose but would not fall down now he had a belt on. <br />
<br />
before he could think or anything elas, there was a knock at the door, he did not know who could it be, and he did not know if he should answer it or not, maybe he should just pretend there is no one home, but before he could decide he heard the person behind the door yell “Luke we know you&#39;re in, now come and open the dam door!” it was a kid voice, and it must be one of Lukes friends, so he decided that if he knows he was here then he is going to have to see what the kid wants. <br />
<br />
When he opened the door he did not just see one kid there where 5 of them, one had a baseball bat and another hand a baseball, and the kid who shouted before said “took you long enough, are you coming or not, Bob did not know what to do, these kids are obviously Lukes friends and they obviously want to go play baseball, but should he, it would beat just staing in this small crappy home,  <br />
<br />
and he needed to know more about Luke if he is going to take over his life now, and what better way than hanging around with his friends so he said“ ok, ok I&#39;m coming let me just get my glove and get my shoes on” so he turned around and headed to his new room remembering seeing a baseball glove next to his bed and where he took of his now small shoes what were also next to his bed.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Once he slid on his shoes, ran and jumped out the door and slamming it shut without locking it, knowing no one is going to try and rob his new house with no one around here having anything good to steal, so he fell in line with the kid who shouted, and the kid asked “so I heard some guy tried to tuch you up, when you went to visit your dad” <br />
<br />
Bob gulped and thought well let&#39;s see how good my acting skill are and said “well yer, there was this weird guy what I think just got out of the jail, and when he saw me he grabbed me and then grabbed my dick and balls, I quickly ran off and told the guard what he did, and the next thing the pervert was on the floor, being dragged back into the jail, so I said thanks to the guard, but mom was no help she blamed me?” the kid laughed and said “jez you really do have some bad luck, when it comes to adults, your dad is in jail and your mom is always a bitch to you, and then some stranger tried to have fun with your small dick” <br />
<br />
But before Bob could say anything knowing that if anyone calls your mom a bitch you are going to defend her, even though Bobs expressions on her right now that she is (a Bitch), but still, she is right now his mom,  <br />
<br />
one of the boys in front says “shut up Smiff, I thought you said he is your best friend and you are calling him mom such stuff” Bob just added “yer smiff, that going too far, I know she is not great but she is till my ma!” in an annoyed voice and walk so he was now in stride with the kid who stuck up for him and said “thanks” with him saying “no probs, Luke, you always stick up for me”  <br />
<br />
The kid who stuck up for him and Bob managed to get in a conversation, what Bob was actually enjoying, an till Smiff shouted “look, I&#39;m sorry, Luke and Jason, I might of went too far?”  <br />
<br />
Bob was only happy that he managed to get Jasons name, not really liking Smiff, he reminded him too much of the kids who pushed him in to crime, and he did not want to be around people like that again, and said “whatever Smiff, can&#39;t you see I am talking to Jason?” and he carried on walking and talking to Jason about the new videogame he got from his Pa, with Jason coming from a much more wealthy family than most of the boys in the group, and Bob was happy seeing that Jason was now smiling that he  chose to stay talking to Jason instead of talking to the idiot Smiff. <br />
<br />
But Bob guessed that Luke would off not done that, seeing the other kids looking at him oddly, and he did not know if he should go and say he accepts Smiff’s apology and try and live is life just like Luke would, or change Lukes life and maybe become better friends with people like Jason, it seems like Jason would be a better friend if he did not want to end up in jail again, but what if people started to talk,  <br />
<br />
Smiff somehow new he claimed he was touched up by his old body yesterday, so he probably will find out about the person who claiming to be the real Luke and spired that info, so maybe he should stick to acting just like Luke and go back to Smiff?  <br />
<br />
but He did not realize how childish this is, trying to choose what friend he wants to Hang out with, and to anyone listening in would just hear kids having a childish argument,  <br />
<br />
but who does he choose? Smiff so he is more like the real Luke and people don’t think he is acting different, or Jason, with him seeming like the nicer and just better person to become friends with, but knowing that he will get odd looks if he does?</p>
