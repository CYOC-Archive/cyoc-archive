<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chicochad crawled along on his hands and knees after his doppelganger, and out of the kennel.  Dirk had come up to them, he bent over to tousel Chad&#39;s head hair, and was now inspecting him as if he really were a canine and not a naked man on a leash. Chad tried to speak but only dog noises came out: barks, yips, snarls, growls and whimpers.<br />
<br />
&quot;He seems a bit skittish, Chad,&quot; Dirk said as he petted the dogboy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable, he&#39;s a rescue. He just needs to get used to your scent,&quot; he said guiding Chad&#39;s head to bury his face in Dirk&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
Dirk leaned forward continuing his inspection, and burying his crotch deeper into Chicochad&#39;s face. Then Dirk grabbed Chicochad&#39;s nuts, squeezed and tugged on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought all the dogs from the pound were neutered?&quot; Dirk asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said Chico was a rescue, didn&#39;t say I got him at the pound. Still you are right. I probably should have him neutered. Maybe when I take him to the vet&#39;s for his shots? Say do you think I should get him prosthetic balls or leave the empty sac?&quot; Fake Chad asked.<br />
<br />
ChicoChad whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your choice.  Me, I&#39;d probably cut of the balls sac and all. Give it a cleaner look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean him,&quot; Fake Chad corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you cut his balls off. Male pronoun is him. Neuter pronoun is it,&quot; Dirk explained still holding Chicochad&#39;s balls. He added, &quot;You know I bet his sac is big enough for a decent snuff pouch.<br />
<br />
Chicochad whimpered and tried to pull away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess, Chico really needs to pee. Better get going. See you, Dirk. I&#39;ll think about the snuff pouch idea. I guess they do look big enough to hold a tin of Skoal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good grief, he was serious. Chicochad stopped moving. The leash went taut. He tried to pull away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may just let him keep his balls, if he is an obedient dog. You only cut the balls off willful animals to make them docile and obedient,&quot; Phony Chad said.<br />
<br />
Chicochad got the message, and he trotted obediently behind his master keeping the leash lax.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he understood you,&quot; Dirk laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;All has to do with tone of your voice,&quot; Fake Chad said? &quot;Dogs really understand few words.  Now, Come- boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chicochad was so intent on keeping up with the Fake Chad while moving on his hands and knees that it wasn&#39;t until he felt asphalt under his knees that he realized he had been led out of his yard, down the block and was now crossing the street to the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;New dog, Chad?&quot; asked Mikey a neighbor kid as he rode up on his bike.<br />
<br />
Damn, whatever Chico did to him when he stole Chad&#39;s body, everyone saw him as a dog now even though he was in Chico&#39;s former body. He tried to say &quot;Mike&quot; but all he did was yap. He could only make dog sounds. Was it the dog collar? Wait, wearing Chico&#39;s gold chain had turned him into Chico complete with his weird dick piercings. Was the dog collar turning him into a real dog? Was that even possible?<br />
<br />
While Chad was lost in thought, his master had led him across the street, and to a bench by the fountain where the different paths and trails through the park converged. Chicochad sat on his bare haunches with his hands between his legs palms down and his feet on either side of his hands. He noticed his thumbs were bent funny. But they didn&#39;t hurt. He felt strangely normal. <br />
<br />
People walked by, none seemed upset or concerned that the big white jock had a small naked Latino boy on the end of  a dogleash.  Chicochad stared over at his former body sprawled out on the bench. He only noticed now the Fake Chad&#39;s wardrobe selection. Nearly transparent short white nylon shorts that hugged his ass and crotch. Chad had gotten the pair back in middle school when they had hung loosely on his younger physique.  On his adult body they looked painted on. The only other clothing Chad wore were socks and shoes. He had accessorized with Chad&#39;s Apple watch and some bulky jewelry  that Chad rarely wore. Damn, Chicochad loved that body.  He inhaled the scents of the park. He could smell the fake Chad and the guys and women going by with too much perfume or cologne. He noticed a few dogs, squirrels, birds and the like. He just sat there contentedly being a good boy with his tongue hanging out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Chad! Whassup?&quot; a familiar voice asked.<br />
<br />
Before he turned his head. Chad smelled his bro Brad&#39;s body odor, and the rank stench of his dog Max. <br />
<br />
The Fake Chad stood, and stammered, &quot;B-B-Brad, I uh didn&#39;t expect to see you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the rents asked me to look in on you while they were away. Surprised you weren&#39;t home. Dirk told me you were in the park with your dog. Now that really surprised me- since when did you want a dog. I mean after Max mounted you- well, tried to mount you, you&#39;d never own a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Chico here is a good wingman. I&#39;ve got 7 phone numbers and 3 dates this week with just sitting here with him,&quot; Fake Chad bragged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad, Lil bro,&quot; Brad said draping his arm across Fake Chad&#39;s bare shoulders. <br />
<br />
Fake Chad pulled at Chicochad&#39;s leash, and said, &quot;Come, Chico.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chicochad remembered all the stinky people who stopped and petted him and gave fakeChad their phone numbers. He had 3 dates with women and 2 dates with guys plus a couple call mes.  Loud snuffling reminded Chad that Max was near, and now outweighed him.<br />
<br />
He looked over his shoulder at Max while continuing to follow FakeChad and his brother. Max looked confused. He trotted up behind Fake Chad and sniffed. Then he dropped back behind Chicochad, and soon a wet nose snuffled Chicochad&#39;s bum and balls.  Then Max trotted up next to Chicochad and smirked at him. Chad hadn&#39;t thought dogs could smirk before, but that was the only word that seemed to fit the look on Max&#39;s race. Max&#39;s scent seemed stronger. Chicochad noticed that Max had unsheathed his penis.  Chicochad looked up at the two men walking ahead of him. They needed to notice what Max might-<br />
<br />
Too late.<br />
<br />
The now 150 lb dog climbed on Chicochad&#39;s back and mounted him. Chicochad yowled and froze. Fake Chad turned as his leash grew taut and the former Chad yowled in pain.  He saw the mastiff mounting Chicochad and burst out in laughter.<br />
<br />
Brad snickered too. He commented, &quot; Boys will be boys. One always has to be the alpha, and one the beta.&quot;  He wasn&#39;t looking at the dogs, but at the man he thought was his kid bro.<br />
<br />
FakeChad didn&#39;t notice. Former Chad did, despite his discomfort and embarrassment. <br />
<br />
Fake Chad noticed something else. Chicochad&#39;s face was pushing put as a muzzle, and his hind legs were shorter than his front legs, and he was sprouting fur all over. Brad didn&#39;t notice the changes, he already just saw a dog when he looked at Chico.<br />
<br />
Chad felt the changes too.  His thumbs and big toes were migrating behind his paws. His teeth were all sharpening into canines. He was getting farrier. He sprouted a tail. His contact with Max was accelerating his transformation. He really was becoming a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I might as well neuter Chico after all&quot; Fake Chad commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great. Let&#39;s go to the veterinary clinic  where I work now. I&#39;m itching to castrate a dog, up until now I&#39;ve only assisted and watched, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll let me do my brother&#39;s dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe in a week or two. I want to wait until he is completely changed,&quot; answered Fake Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Changed?&quot; Brad asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I meant trained,&quot; lied Fake Chad. He added, &quot;this-&quot; gesturing to Max knotted with Chicochad, &quot;is a bit distracting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad nodded knowingly. He replied, &quot;Yeah, distracting. &quot;<br />
<br />
Chicochad noticed that both Brad and Fake Chad were sporting boners. Then to his horror he realized he had a boner too. He looked between his forelegs and saw that the piercing was gone. He now sported a bright red conical penis hanging from his furry belly. As he watched, the red shifted to a monochrome.  He looked up the world had gone from color to black and white</p>
