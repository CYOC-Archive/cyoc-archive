<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Credits to FMAlkemist for some parts of the story ;)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I thought Burton was going to play Jasper. Damnit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared Leland, Gay Screenwriter on set of the latest Burton/Bling film, slammed his fists angrily on the top. Lightly bruising his knuckles in the process as he pressed his head down <br />
<br />
An action version of his original script-already not liking what they&#39;ve done to his original script by completely doing a 180 on the storyline. Exceptionally furious when Jack forcibly shifting the homophobic &#39;villain&#39; , Jasper LeRoi, into a heterophobic butch lesbian.<br />
<br />
And now, after demands to step it up a notch by making her ‘dyke’ stereotype. It was enough, he was going to stick with the original version of the misogynistic villain, out of anger and creative oppression-rubs and crosses were made to the new changes of Beatrix-firmly believing His original idea of Jasper LeRoi should take center stage. <br />
<br />
“Let the two homophobes fight one another!” He spoke, unwittingly getting aroused by the thought of two aggressive macho men fighting with one another as he rapidly penned down his script, bringing the character to life.<br />
<br />
On paper and in real life.<br />
<br />
———————————————————-<br />
Outside, with that proclamation, the average sized Hollywood trailer seemed to take it up a notch, as it was originally once in a secluded corner so that no one could disturb him during the writing process-was wheeled at lightning speed to a location he tried his best to stay away from. <br />
<br />
Placed directly in the center, and in front of the two celebrities he wanted to avoid after their changes. As it took on a shine, much larger as it elevated to a second level like the ones of the actors behind him, taking on a darker-metallic polish as it unwittingly blazed off lights and attention.<br />
<br />
Of course, Jared and the others were oblivious to the former reality of these changes, as most people still stayed away from the trailer despite all the obnoxious intention its getting, but not because of the fact that the person who owns the trailer wanted privacy.<br />
<br />
But rather that he was....<br />
<br />
—————————————-<br />
“A misogynist prick!” Jared Leland spoke, completely immersed in his craft despite the obvious changes and shifts in locations that was made.<br />
<br />
(Jasper LeRoi, an arrogant America-Born, French Caucasian man, that has a bravado that could beat up any horse, with an unruly desire to show off at any moment whenever possible.)<br />
<br />
With that penned down, Jared felt a flush of confidence rushing through his veins. Taking a deep breath, admiring the fresh air conditioning and wide space of his large double deckered trailer.<br />
<br />
He may not have that creative freedom from Jack-but it does not mean he could not show off his wealth. With luxurious items mixed with the essence of french in them. He scoffed, as he continued to jot down the character.<br />
<br />
(Jasper, being the french musclehead he is, is almost always spotting extremely masculine attire, typically a tight red short sleeve button down, rolled up all the way to the elbow...)<br />
<br />
With that notion, the muscles of his arms tightened a little-as though wanting to show off. Jotting down furiously, not even noting as his sleeves rolled up to the edge of his arms, hands slightly fumbling over his neat diplomatic handwriting as though he is becoming increasingly restless by the minute. <br />
<br />
An increase in testosterone for someone who should be accustomed to a masculine role. As his turtleneck loosened up from his skinny attire. Gaining muscle steadily as his turtle neck now tightened up as on cue, gaining a row of marble buttons down below and popping down a collar as in the script, blazing red as his evidence of slight muscle growth could be seen straining against his Oxfrat flaming red Dress shirt.<br />
<br />
(dark brown slacks that support his tall domineering exterior, a pair of hiking boots to accentuate that what Jasper LeRoi wants-STOMP!...Jasper LeRoi gets.)<br />
<br />
With that notion, Jared gave a wide grin at the thought of how this is really going on smoothly, as he could sincerely visualize how Jasper looked like at the back of his mind. Almost as though he is in sync with the character himself.<br />
<br />
And apparently at his side too-as a wide full length mirror appeared in adjunction to where he is currently sitting, mirroring the changes in the script as he incorporated a new scenario, as well as new lines, to replace the dyke heterophobic villian that was originally taking the spotlight. The ladies loooove the bad guy, and who better to lead that role that a hunky douche like Jasper LeRoi himself?<br />
<br />
Glancing at the mirror between intervals on jotting down with his pen, his buttocks definitely seemed squarer, as those skinny jeans expanded with his thickening trunk, dark blue melting to bright brown pants, growing in length as the writer’s spine extended, giving a hefty ‘HAHA!’ as he knew he exceeded Jack Burton’s height! Nothing and no one can beat LeRoi!<br />
<br />
The bottoms rolled up and resting over XL Earthly brown hiking boots, giving satisfying STOMPS as said script writer kept giving the occasional smirk to himself for every stomp-after all...<br />
<br />
What Jasper LeRoi wants, Jasper LeRoi gets.<br />
<br />
(As well as a tan leather belt that is wide, almost a weightlifter&#39;s belt but not...)<br />
<br />
Almost stumbling on a case of writers block...adjusting his tight-tan belt with one palm and gripping the pen with a newfound force. This writing shit aint easy, but someone’s gotta do it. On cue, a large Texas sized belt buckle resting right above his crotch, metallic rims for an intricate design on the top.<br />
<br />
(And muscles. Lots of muscles.)<br />
<br />
SNAP!<br />
<br />
With that addition, the pen cracked open due to incredible brute strength it was held by. Palms were of those of a footballer, large and fingers were filled with meat as though he chugged on protein. Evident by the amount of meat stored inside his deluxe sized fridge in his double dickered trailer.<br />
<br />
Standing up, as he FLEXED as hard as he could in front of the mirror, incredible heart pounding hills were protruding on both sides as the veins loved the admiration and daily training they got. Evident from all the weights and un-read fan mail he got, LeRoi’s too busy flexing to read all that.<br />
<br />
LeRoi’s too busy to read anything at all!<br />
<br />
With that being said, here comes the incredible inhalation. As the ex scriptwriter took a deep breath, his pectorals soared up into two unbreakable basketballs, as the top two buttons let loose in order to exaggerate his gains. His abdominals were not spared as they rumbled their way into a solid eight pack, ones that ladies could not help tracing as he proudly lifts a bench carrying a couple of them on top. <br />
<br />
(The ladies call me a muscle head but hey, I’m muscle all over!)<br />
<br />
As his interests shift to the jock end of the spectrum, more inclined to front stage and showing off as he had to get waxed all over for modelling-cept the crotch, that’s a man’s treasure! Scouted from a frat nearby, he did what he knew best as he skyrocketed to the top almost overnight. Flex, workout, pose...<br />
<br />
”Hey flexing is posing! Gotta flex MORE!”<br />
<br />
As he did that, exhaling in a warm mist, Hercules’ sized chest still puffed out as his broad shoulders filled in the bricks behind, his powerful back arrogantly supporting his new gait and outlook in life.<br />
<br />
His hips don’t lie, and neither does his squared  un-penetrated bubble butt pressed out-against his newfound jockstrap, partially strained due to his libido and actual COCKiness for dem ladies, a 10 inch pile driver-or even longer in some occasions.<br />
<br />
Sandwiching it briefly, the pitch tent rose into occasion-so did those enormous trunks spread far apart, almost inviting hot babes to come on and have a long ride on em’. Feet wiggling in anticipation as they stretch and contort till they reach the ends of them size 15 boots, etching on that french caucasian tan that crept out from the edges on his fingers and toes.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get those faggots to do my dirty work.”<br />
<br />
With that being said, under the ‘supervision’ of ‘Jasper LeRoi’, the script finished itself of as the newly tan hue engulfs his biceps, his torso, groin areas are basked in his new movie star appearance, neck stretching as the hue swallows the paleness whole, as well possibly developing a more youthful sheen despite the obvious size and stature increase when compared to his former self.<br />
<br />
“HAHAHA!” As a deep baritone resonates within the actor’s voice, sending rumbles all over as though it dominated gay musicals just for how manly it sounded. With a large lump at the top of his neck. Etched were the final details on the script, his thick, manly man fingers pick the papers up and gave them a good glance.<br />
<br />
(Chiseled jaw, thick eyebrows, slick pomadoured hair...)<br />
<br />
With that being said, the final descriptions begin to take place-with some off script additions of course.<br />
<br />
First was the chiseled jaw, as it grew out to be a lantern as aftershave layered over what used to be a beard. Threading over the side burns as they style themselves fancifully whilst keeping the cool and manliness in shape-adopting a pure raven black like down below..<br />
<br />
As his hair shifted and melted to pure black, his eyebrows surely thickened with curls at the end, raising upward in a questioning stance as though he’s peering at his own reflection-now staring at the mirror. Can’t get enough of himself after all.<br />
<br />
His glasses slid downward onto his wrist, forming an expensive golden Brolex, flaunting his wealth and masculinity even further as his nostrils flared into a firm hook.<br />
<br />
His hair ultimately climaxed, gaining raven curls as it curled and coiled up towards the top. Top branded Gel holding it in its place as though erect, an extreme hairdo of the retrowave breeders as he spotted a slick pompadour doo like his buddy Garner, ain’t a huge fan of motorcycles as much as he is but definitely in style and hard in its own way. <br />
<br />
Sides, his muscles do the talkin’<br />
<br />
“Heh! Ain’t gonna fall down to any gay beast! I am the hero of the story”, almost as oblivious as the character himself, and to the fact he was written as a villain, his eyes flashed in the spotlight, a dashing blue of his new self as Jasper LeRoi takes center stage, BURSTING through the door of his trailer, light radiance shone all over his entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time to remind people why there is no one like Jasper LeRoi...&quot; *Flexes*</p>
