<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Ryan thought to himself that he could live 100 more years and never have a day this good again.  It was just a little past noon and he had put his cousins in their place and given himself a mastodonic penis. He looked out the window from the bedroom and he could see the twins struggling to clean out the barn.  Aaron was throwing up next to the barn; he looked absolutely miserable. He watched with an evil delight in his brothers suffering.  Not such a big man now huh, he thought to himself. He saw someone turn down the driveway it was Aj&#39;s car. Aj parked and him and Charlie got out of the car. Ryan climbed down the stairs and met them at the door. <br />
<br />
  Aj was standing in the door frame, when Ryan opened the door. &quot;Swim?&quot; Aj asked holding up a towel as if proof was necessary. &quot;I&#39;ll grab my stuff and be right out,&quot; Ryan responded and turned back into the house. Aj was an inch or two taller than Ryan, he had dark brown hair that was always styled and muscular features. He had these green eyes that always seemed sad even when he was smiling. Despite being one of Ryan&#39;s oldest friends, he didn&#39;t feel like he really knew Aj. Ryan would come away from a long deep conversation with Aj only to realize that he had done all the talking and divulging of secrets. Ryan had a sneaking suspicion that Aj was gay, but figured if it was true, he&#39;d tell him when he was ready. Charlie was the tallest of the three, at 6&#39; 5&quot;. Ryan knew that because Charlie would find ways to work it into conversations.  He had a wirey frame that was begging for some muscle to fill it out.  Despite eating almost non-stop nothing seemed to stick to it though. Charlie played JV basketball, and supplied the sports commentary for the group. If he was a little more coordinated, he might have made the varsity team. Aj and Ryan called him hurricane Charlie, you never knew when he was going to move and knock everything over.  He had light brown hair and brown eyes. Charlie was an open book, he talked non stop about everything that was happening in his life down to using the bathroom.  If you needed to get a secret out Charlie was the guy to trust it to. Ryan came out of the house with his suit and towel and they all climbed into Aj&#39;s Honda for the quick drive over to Charlie&#39;s uncle&#39;s pool.  <br />
<br />
  Charlie talked the whole car ride. He had heard about the bonfire incident and wanted to let Ryan know it wasn&#39;t that bad and that everyone knows Jack is serious shit so it&#39;ll all be ok, in his estimation it could have been much worse, like what if it had been a wine cooler. Ryan and Aj sat quietly until they arrived. Charlie&#39;s uncle was a lawyer or something for the city and lived in the &#39;nice&#39; neighborhood in town.  He had a big two story house and most importantly, a pool.  Charlie&#39;s aunt answered the door and let them in, pleasantries were exchanged some niceties were said and after a few minutes Ryan was shown to a bathroom so he could change into his suit. Ryan had never had a new swim suit, the family didn&#39;t swim often so wasting money on suits out of the question. He actually didn&#39;t know who this one belonged to before he got it, one of the cousins but who knows which.  It was a pair of green trunks that had seen better days, the netting inside was completely the cord to tighten the waste was frayed and the once vibrant shade of green was bleached out by repeated exposure to chlorine. he slipped into them and taking another moment to appreciate his gigantic dick.  Once they were up the tight shorts clearly showed the outline of his cock going down his right leg. He smirked and walked out of the bathroom towards the pool. <br />
<br />
  In the back yard Aj and Charlie were already in the pool. They were hanging on the side talking to Charlie’s 21 year old cousin Ally and her two friends who were sunning themselves on lawn chairs. Ryan walked down the steps slowly letting the water rise over his tool and then dived in so the rest of him was wet. Charlie was trying to impress one of the girls with his basketball exploits, Aj was chatting with another about celebrity gossip and Ryan tried to make small talk with Charlie’s cousin.  He’d never been confident enough to talk to girls, it was awkward for him and it made him second-guess himself. Charlie was working his hardest to get the girl he was flirting with into the water.  He proposed a chicken fight, stating confidently that even with her as a handicap he could still beat Ryan and Aj. She took a big pull off her margarita and agreed to do it, jumping into the pool.  She swam over to Charlie and got on his shoulders. “Come on ladies” Charlie teased, “whose on top.” Aj didn’t look pleased with this turn of events, honestly neither was Ryan but a challenge was a challenge.  “I’m a little taller,” Ryan said flatly, “get on my shoulders.” Aj dipped and Ryan slipped his legs over his shoulders.  This made the already tight suit become even tighter.  As Aj adjusted back and forth, getting Ryan in the perfect position, Ryan’s dick rubbed up against the back of his neck.  “I think we’re good” Aaron said a little worried he might get stiff from all the movement.  The fight began slowly Aj and Charlie maneuvering, trying to trip each other, while Ryan and the girl tired to push each other off.  Then it happened. Charlie grabbed Ryan’s leg and got his leg behind Aj’s to trip him. The girl grabbed at Ryan and found purchase on the waste band of his suit.  Down went Aj, Ryan was spun around, the suit came ripping off, and the two boys went under. Aj struggled to push Ryan off of him and free his face from Ryan’s crotch.  The two boys came up to a victorious Charlie gloating and her holding his suit.  The other two girls tipped forward to get a better view of everything.  There was lots of laughing until Ryan stood all the way up. The water came up just under his waste. Leaving several inches of dick exposed.  All eyes were on Ryan’s sausage. Ryan thought about trying to cover up, but then decided not to, he casually walked over to the girl holding his destroyed suit and took it from her.  Walked up the stairs got his towel and wrapped it around his waste. Then he went over and sat with the girls. All of a sudden Ryan was a lot more popular with the ladies.  They were chatty. Laughed at his dumb jokes. Charlie found his efforts completely frustrated.  20 minutes later the guys left.  Charlie was unusually quiet on the ride home, as they dropped Ryan off, he apologized for the suit and muttered “I guess you grew into yourself”</p>
