<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment he pressed the shutter button, two things happened. First, Ty disappeared. Before he did it, he doubted if he even had the power to become invisible, but it worked. The camera hung in the air in front of him in his invisible hands. On the screen was a picture of the family. Only one thing was strange about it. None of them had their original heads anymore. That was the second thing that had happened. Their heads had all been randomly swapped. Ty smiled and watched the mayhem unfold.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Susie screamed first. Her change was the most severe and the most immediately noticeable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh, what the fuck!?&quot; she shrieked as she looked down in front of her at the paws that had been hands only a second ago. Her whole body felt wrong. She felt all furry and naked, and her hands and feet felt weirdly stretched and stiff. There was also that thing sticking out of the bottom of her spine that seemed to want to wag around.<br />
<br />
Shortly after Susie freaked out, the rest of the family gasped and looked down at themselves to discover that they were no longer themselves, at least not from the neck down.<br />
<br />
Katie and Billy discovered that they now had their mother and father's bodies respectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; said Katie as she grabbed her mother's saggy big breasts. &quot;I've got boobies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And, I'm huge,&quot; said Billy as he looked down at his big gut. &quot;Look at this, Alex.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to show his body off to his big brother only to discover Alex's body with their dog's head on it. Buster panted and stumbled a bit with Alex's legs. He quickly crouched down resting Alex's hands in front of him to sit on the ground.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alex's head stared down in stunned silence at his new body. His sister's beautiful breasts stood out prominently before him on her chest. Astonished, he looked past her cleavage down to her sandals and her cute pink painted toenails. Alex tentatively felt her crotch, verifying that this body was really fully female. Years of secret fantasizing about his sister's sexy body flashed through his mind. He had a bit of a transgender fetish, and his favorite fantasy involved him switching bodies with his sister and then gleefully masturbating. He grabbed his sister's bountiful breasts. This moment, it was a dream come true for sure, and her breasts were everything he had dreamed they would be. No, they were even better than he had dreamed--so much softer and more sensitive than he could ever have hoped for. It was heaven.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; called an angry voice from below, pulling him back down to Earth. &quot;Hands off my tits!&quot; shouted his sister.<br />
<br />
Alex turned to see his sister's head glaring up at him, incongruously positioned on top of the body of their Great Dane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susie?&quot; he asked, curiously. He hardly believed that any of this was really happening, especially after seeing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Children,&quot; called their mother from below. All of them, even the dog, turned to face her. &quot;Let's all try to keep it together and not panic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Billy, finally acknowledging his mother. &quot;Mommy's got my body now.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true. She looked down at her son's body below her. It seemed so small and weak, but that was to be expected. It was only 6 years old. Although she felt terrifyingly helpless and weird being that small, not to mention there was that alien thing between her son's legs, she drew upon years of taking control of family emergencies to keep a calm head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; cried their father, who lacked his wife's resolve, as he looked down at his daughter's cute body below him. Everything was pink. Even her cute little fingernails were pink. He looked up at his old body with his son's little head on it and then at his wife's body with his daughter's head on it, her hair still tied up in cute pigtails. They seemed so huge now. And then he noticed how different it felt between the legs beneath him. Something important was missing.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Still invisible, Ty set down the phone on the picnic table next to the family's half finished meals and leaned against a nearby tree to watch them try to cope with the impossible mess he had created for them.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Billy and Katie were having a great time being grownups. Billy kept lifting heavy things, like rocks, while Katie sauntered around, shaking her big butt and tits as she went. She loved feeling like a woman.<br />
<br />
Their parents were coping less well. Their mother, once the undisputed leader of the family, was struggling to keep control of the situation now that she had the smallest body of them all. Billy and Katie all but ignored her demands for them to stop playing around with their new bodies. Meanwhile, their father was going into shock as he tried to cope with having the very girly body of his youngest daughter. He just kept picturing what was below those pink overalls and thinking about how strange it felt. Little did he know how strange his balding middle-aged head looked on her 8-year-old body.<br />
<br />
Alex meanwhile, in single-minded fascination, explored every detail of his sister's sexy body. He kept examining her well-manicured fingers and running those fingers over her lovely curves. He smiled, enjoying the sensation that her soft hands gave him. It seemed too good to be true. He must be dreaming, he thought. He had to be. Right? One thing was for sure: if he was dreaming, he never wanted to wake up.<br />
<br />
Susie, on the other hand (or paw as it were), was faring less well. &quot;Get away from me,&quot; she yelled at Buster as he crawled around behind her on Alex's hands and feet to sniff at what had been his own ass up until a short while ago. Susie kept turning to get away from him. It was weird enough having a dog's body and having to pad around on four legs, without having her brother's body with their dog's head on it sniffing under her new tail. &quot;Buster, stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are we going to do?&quot; asked their father. It was less of a question and more of an expression of panic.<br />
<br />
Their mother looked up at him. &quot;We'll figure something out,&quot; she said, without really thinking. Comforting had become habitual to her over the years. &quot;We'll just go to Aunt Kathy's and then-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; he cut her off. &quot;Just how the hell are we going to do that? Neither of us can drive with these bodies. Susie can't drive as a dog. Katie and Billy don't know how to drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I could drive?&quot; Alex offered hopefully.<br />
<br />
His parents looked up at him and said, &quot;No!&quot; in unison.<br />
<br />
He frowned and comforted himself by feeling up his sister's body some more. Having a nice pair of tits made it easy to ignore his parents' bickering.<br />
<br />
Susie frantically looked up at Alex massaging her tits while his body even more frantically chased her around with their dog's head sniffing her ass. It's nose poked her between the legs, and she noticed another new thing about this body. She had a pair of balls... and a dick!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; she cried as the realization hit her. Buster was a male! She had dog balls and a freaking doggy dick! &quot;Oh, God! Oh, God no!&quot; she moaned and began crying. She stopped trying to run, and Buster happily sniffed her behind, fascinated at finding his own scent on another dog. She just sobbed, thinking about her ruined life. She had been a cheerleader. Now, she wasn't even human anymore.</p>
