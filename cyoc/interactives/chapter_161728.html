<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily entered the stall, grabbing the saddle. Carefully, she threw it over the back of Tomfoolery. She was being gentle, not wanting to scare her new mare. She had to have her play along, for now. Had to have her get used to this. She giggled a little as she got a look at Tomfoolery&#39;s new sex. *Yes,* she thought to herself. *She is in heat.*<br />
<br />
Returning to Tomfoolery&#39;s front, she presented the bit and bridle. &quot;Open up,&quot; she said, and carefully put it in. &quot;There&#39;s a good girl. Yes, you&#39;re a good girl,&quot; she said, teasing the mare as she patted her between her eyes.<br />
<br />
Tomfoolery let herself be led out of her stall, out into the yard. She saw Emily get up to her, lifting a foot into the stirrups, hoisting herself up. She was amazed at how light Emily felt sitting on top of her. But, after all, she was a horse now, a lot bigger and stronger than she used to be as a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;re going to take it easy at first. I want you to walk around in a circle. Try to get used to your new body. How it moves, how your muscles work.&quot; Tomfoolery started walking. It still felt a little strange to her, walking on all four. The sensation of hooves clopping against the gravel, instead of soft, shoe-clad feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s good. You&#39;re getting the hang of it. It&#39;s starting to feel like a horse naturally moves.&quot; And with every step, it felt a little more natural. A little less weird. She was a horse, and horses walk on four legs.<br />
<br />
When Emily directed her towards a path leading out of the yard, Tomfoolery hesitated. She felt exposed, naked, hesitant to meet other people like this. Emily seemed to pick up on the hesitation. &quot;Are you feeling a little shy, Tomfoolery?&quot; she asked, leaning down, almost whispering into her ear. She neighed in response. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be. You&#39;re just a horse, remember. Everyone will just see you as a horse, they won&#39;t know you&#39;re anything but. Only you and me know you weren&#39;t always one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Emily was right, of course. She was a horse, and horses don&#39;t feel exposed and naked just because they&#39;re not wearing clothes. Horses don&#39;t *wear* clothes. The feeling of nakedness drained away, and she strode off down the path, feeling a little more confident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s try a trot. Tomfoolery, trot.&quot; Tomfoolery started moving faster. Found a rhythm, a way to move that felt natural. All four feet working in tandem. It felt good. Good to move her body like this. Emily grinned. She knew she was embedding these commands into her former boyfriends new mind. &quot;Yes, girl, just like that. You&#39;re a good horse, you know. A good horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomfoolery did feel like a good horse. She trotted along the path. &quot;You&#39;re a natural, Tomfoolery. In this reality, I must have trained you well. I wonder if you can remember me training you? Otherwise, how would you know my commands?&quot; And there was a flash of memory in Tomfoolery&#39;s mind. It was hazy, unclear, like a dream. A dream of being trained.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they came to a large, open field. &quot;Okay, girl, what do you say we ramp this up a little? Gallop!&quot; There was an eagerness in Emily&#39;s voice, and eagerness that infected Tomfoolery. She sped up. &quot;Faster, girl, faster.&quot; Soon, she was running as fast as she could, her legs perfectly coordinated. She found herself being gently guided, gently steered, by the way Emily used her bit and bridle. It came naturally to her. She somehow knew what every command Emily gave her meant, what she should do.<br />
<br />
On the second round around the field, she noticed another horse - and rider - approaching the field from down another path. She found it a little weird how she had focused on the horse first, but realized what had first made her aware was the faint scent of the horse. Emily saw them, too &quot;Okay, slow. Slooow.&quot; Tomfoolery found herself braking down to a walk. They were still a distance away. &quot;Hey, look, I think that&#39;s Eric.&quot; Tomfoolery knew that name. Emily had mentioned him several times over the last weeks. He was one of the owners of the stable. &quot;Yes. It is. Eric, and Maine Starr. One of our prize stallions!&quot; She leanded down, and whispered into the mares ear. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to get to know him better? Maine Starr, I mean. I bet that once you get a good whiff of his musky scent, you&#39;ll want him. I mean, it&#39;s only natural, you are a mare, and from what I glimpsed back in the stall, you&#39;re in heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
*What?* Tomfoolery thought. No way did she want to &#39;get to know&#39; the stallion. She was only supposed to be a horse for a few days. But as they came closer, she could feel his scent growing stronger. And... she could feel the effect it had on her body. She found her new sex twitching, winking. It was an instinctual response. She could feel a need growing inside of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, babe! Is that...&quot; Eric&#39;s word pulled at Tomfoolery&#39;s attention. *Babe*?<br />
<br />
Emily seemed to be caught off guard. &quot;Uh, hi, Eric. Yeah, this is Tomfoolery, my *mare*.&quot; Why did she put such a pressure on the word mare, Tomfoolery thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, I see. Anyway, I was thinking, would you like to come over tonight? After you&#39;re done with Tomfoolery and your duties in the stable?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily beamed. &quot;I&#39;d love to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomfoolery knew she should be concerned. Knew she should try to protest somehow. But she was just a mare. If she tried to protest, if she acted out of place of how a mare should, how would Eric react? And... and the scent of the stallion was just intoxicating. She could see him picking up her scent, too. His member, his thick, flared member, growing out of its sheat. *How would it feel?* she wondered. *How would it feel to be mounted by that.* There was a slickness in her new sex, a throbbing desire.<br />
<br />
The two humans eventually stopped talking, and Eric directed his stallion to move. With the scent dissipating, Tomfoolery started to think more clearly again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you had to witness that, Tomfoolery.&quot; Emily was leaning down, patting her neck. &quot;I guess, in this reality, since you&#39;re just my mare, Eric and I are an item. Don&#39;t worry, though, girl. Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not going to let him fuck me.&quot; She paused for a moment. &quot;Though maybe... you seemed to react really well to Maine Starr, didn&#39;t you? Would you like to...you know...feel how it&#39;s like to be bred? I bet you do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Part of her *did*. But, no, she didn&#39;t like the idea. She wasn&#39;t *really* a mare, she was a human, and being bred by a stallion was just *wrong*. As if Emily was sensing her hesitation, she added, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;d be perfectly okay with it. I can&#39;t keep my girl from getting the full experience, a once-in-a-lifetime chance. And it would be completely natural. You are, after all, just a mare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily ordered Tomfoolery into a trot again, and they rode of. It was a relief to her, getting to just be again, not having to be faced with the urges of her body and Emily&#39;s teasing.<br />
<br />
They had to have been riding for a while, as when they came back to the stables, the sun was getting low in the sky. Emily cleaned Tomfoolery off. Rinsed her hooves, brushed her all over her body. And then brought her back into the stables.<br />
<br />
The scent hit her the moment they entered the doors. Maine Starr! He was in here. It brought those urges, those desires, immediately to the forefront again. And sure enough, he was already standing in one of the stalls. They passed him as she was led to hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, girl, I&#39;m going to leave you here for the night. I&#39;m off for dinner with Eric. I&#39;ll be back around...&quot; Emily looked at her watch. &quot;Hah, there&#39;s not really a point in me telling me when I&#39;m back, is there? I mean, horses can&#39;t tell time.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Emily gave Tomfoolery a last little pat on her face and turned around. Tomfoolery watched her leave her. Leave her alone here, in the stables, for she didn&#39;t know how long. Alone, except for the other horses. Except for Maine Starr, and his musky, arousing scent. She glanced at the big clock on the wall, but it didn&#39;t make any sense. This was going to be a long night...</p>
