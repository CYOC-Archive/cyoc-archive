<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fifty and feeling the onslaught of middleage Pricilla Goodbody walked out the rear door of the stadium's team entrance. A clipboard in hand she had been so intense listening to the N.B.C. announcers. Her job was to censor whatever anyone said that was not in good taste (Her tastes), or was swearing or filthy in intent. Tin and slender she had never married as the thought of physical contact with another body seemed nasty and something bestial.<br />
<br />
Black hornrimmed glasses from the sixties she wore with pride as if to show her honoring of past values. A dress that went down to her ankles suggested to all her virgin self, untouched by male hands!<br />
<br />
No makeup her face being plain as a board fence she even wore oversized tennis shoes as if they might ward away any possible male suitor's.<br />
<br />
Yet like anyone being warm her own scent and that too being a female one touched the newly sensitive nose of Frank the maturing buck goat.<br />
<br />
Wandering the parking lot as she tried to relax and soon return to her sound proof booth, Pricilla did not notice the approach of a 160 pound male goat.<br />
<br />
In the shade of a large Shumac tree sprouting out of the asphalt Pricilla saw a bench and decided to lay down and close her tired eyes.<br />
<br />
Frank got ever closer and as Pricilla laid on the bench her heavy tennis shoes slipped one to each side of her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my Lord in Heaver!&quot; screamed Pricilla as from her within her sack dress there touched her privates a wet slithering tongue.<br />
<br />
Sitting up as she cried out the big body of Frank's goat self stood at the end of the bench. Her dress all humped up had Frank's goaty head and neck inside as he licked at her sweat groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vile animal, get away from me, me, me, me, oh, oh, oh!&quot; said Pricilla.<br />
<br />
Frank's tongue was making the woman bend her convictions and actually like the sexy feeling he was offering for her and his pleasure.<br />
<br />
Pricilla's hands gripped the bench as she felt the touch of her most private, privates. Little by little she inched her butt closer to the end of that bench allowing Frank easier access to his quary.<br />
<br />
When goaty teeth bit down with real intent to rip and remove silk panties from his desired delight, Pricilla suddenly came back to reality.<br />
<br />
Jumping up she made Frank pull his gaot's head out from under her long skirt. She fixed her hair, positioned her glasses, and with some special intent started to walk toward a car.<br />
<br />
It was her staionwagon which she had driven now for twenty years. As she had used it as an office it was filled with everything she'd ever might need for doing her work as a censor.<br />
<br />
Frank lusting for more of her walked slowly behind Pricilla. As she got to her car and unlocked the driver's door she begged Frank to come to her.<br />
<br />
The billy buck goat went wild with sexual ideas and lusty desires for feeling sex from a true goatish posture. His red and mature sized goat's cock stretched out long, longer, and rigid. He pranced with eager anticapation for what he was soon to feel and came closer to Pricilla.<br />
<br />
Face to face Pricilla was with Frank the buck goat as he straddled her thighs as she sat on the driver's seat of her car. Tongue out and trying to lick her face, Frank was paying her hands no attention at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Creature, vile male creature!&quot; said Pricilla as she stretched something across Frank's tummy and very erect dic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly something was not what Frank had expected would happen. His shaft met with something sticky and rough to the touch. Standing over Pricilla his male parts were open for contact or attack.<br />
<br />
Ripping sounds made him twist and turn his goaty head to the right and left looking over his long hairy back.<br />
<br />
Bleating his sensed pain, Frank struggled to be away from Pricilla but she held fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Duct Tape!&quot; Frank knew of it yet from his past human memories.<br />
<br />
Pricilla always ready for that one male who would rape her had a roll of duct tape ready to impead the man. She quickly wrapped Frank's overly stiff dic with a wind, then went over his flanks and back to wrap the silver sticky cloth tape tighter and tigher.<br />
<br />
A short lived struggle soon had bold goat Frank being hog tied and ready to be shipped to some rodeo. Pricilla had had her thrill and was not one to make the same mistake twice or have it get to large to handle.<br />
<br />
Bleating and wanting to be free of his bonds, Frank was letting the wild instincts of his goat self take full control. He was as scared as a goat could be and even his small memories of human life left to him were fading into a bestial oblivion.<br />
<br />
Pricilla called a security guard to handle the loose animal and with a burshing off of her skirt she returned to keeping the airwaves safe from people like me.<br />
<br />
It was Chuck who in his youthful ways of soft pleasuring had Cynthia lulled into a stupper of sexual delight. She was almost sound asleep as the maturing kid goat slipped his red hot poker out past her lusting lips of sex. He looked out over the parking lot hearing another goat screaming out of pain and terror. The feelings of friendship were now purged from his mind and he thought only of things meaning pleasure to a goat.<br />
<br />
Jumping out of the parked vehicle he made his way in aimless wandering the parking lot and looking for a friend of the fairer sex.<br />
<br />
A morning of satyr sex Cynthia slept to the late afternoon and was awakend by the many hands of a winning team. She was taken hold of, and placed aboard the greyhound bus as a item to make their day of glory on the field a time to remember. As she spread her hairy legs wide the personal attentions of a big halfback was in front of her.</p>
