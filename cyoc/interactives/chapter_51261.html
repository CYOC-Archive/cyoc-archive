<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After thinking about his options, Jeff decided on the perfect vehicle he can turn into.  His dream car.  Ever since he was taking driving lessons, he has always dream of driving a car he truly likes.  The problem is that his dream car cost a lot of money and he had to wait until he gets a job, a bank account, and insurance.  Now with the Chronivac in his possession he can now understand how it feels like to be the car of his dream.<br />
<br />
Once he clicked on the vehicle package, Jeff notice four things he needs to put down before he can start.  First question asked, <i>“What type of vehicle you want to be?”</i>  Jeff knew this was simple and typed down the name of his dream car.  On the fill in section, his dream car is a 2010 Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZO6.  He likes those types of cars because they are one of the prime luxery vehicles everyone would get their hands on.  It’s a two seater that can run speed up to a 120 miles per hour and their sleek design make them look unique and sexy.  He also wanted his corvette to be red since its his favorite color.<br />
<br />
The second question is <i>“How long will the transformation take?”</i>  Jeff guessed that you have to put up a time limit on his change so he was have time to move to a safe location or just stand there to watch the change right in front of his eyes.  Interested by this, he typed down the duration of five minutes, that way he would head to his family’s garage so he could have plenty of room before his transformation is complete.<br />
<br />
The next question states, <i>“How long will you stay in your choosen form?”</i>  He knew that his change needs to have a limit and the last thing he want is to remain a corvette forever.  So Jeff pondered how long will he stay a corvette.  He then remembered that most cars come with a three year warrenty.  Thinking about that, Jeff decided to remain changed in three years.  Sure that would mean he’s going to loose three years of his life, but it will be worth it when he is driven through cities and beaches.<br />
<br />
Finally, the last question is a drop down option that said, <i>“Do you want to alter your reality?”</i>  To Jeff, it was a very interesting question.  Should he change his reality?  Indeed if he turned himself into a car and stayed like that for three years, his family will notice him missing and start searching for him.  Not only that, but if they notice a red corvette in their garage, they would wonder where it came from, who owns it, and how it got there.  But if he changes his reality, he would ultimately remove his life, his family, his education, his friends, just about everything.  Thinking about all of that, he decided to wing it and change the reality around him since it’s going to be a full three years.  He clicked on the pull down option and selected ‘yes’ for the reality change.<br />
<br />
After going through all of that, he quickly reviewed his choices.  He knows that he wants to turn into a 2010 Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZO6, the transformation would take five minutes, he’s going to remain a corvette for three years, and he wants to change his reality.  Confident at what he choosed, he moved the pointer to the start icon.  But before he could click on it, he took a deep breath and said to himself, “All right…  Here goes nothing.”  He clicked start and a message popped up that showed the time limit of the transformation.  It started off a five minutes then went down to 4:59 then 4:58, counting down the seconds.  At the same time, he could feel a tingle within his body.  Jeff knew that his tranformation is starting and has to head to the garage quick before the change is complete.<br />
<br />
He headed to the door and was about to turn the knob when he noticed a small black bruise at the side of his right hand.  He took a closer look at it and didn’t remember getting hurt.  That’s when he noticed the bruise getting bigger and spreading through the side of his hand.  He then looked at his other hand and saw the same thing.  After realizing the change is already starting, Jeff has to move now before its too late.  He opened the door and walked down the hallway.  As he was walking, he felt his feet getting a little uncomfortable in his shoes.  He knew the changes were spreading to his feet and had to hurry before they change completely.  He continued walking to reach the steps and could feel his body starting to expand with his clothes feeling a little snugged.<br />
<br />
As he reached the stairs, he looked at his hands again to see if the transformation has escilated.  The blackness was escalating throughout his hand and he noticed all of his fingernails were gone.  Jeff could also see his fingers and thumbs stretching and curving.  He’s could tell that his hands are starting to form the front of the tires.  Now Jeff seriously needs to reach the garage door to open it before his hands turns into complete tires.  He walked downstairs to the bottom floor the same time his feet begins to feel more cramped then ever.  Jeff looked down and saw his sneakers were bloating up with the soles ripping from the expansion and the lases untieing themselves.  As he reached the bottom floor, his movements were becoming a little stiff while his body grew wide and long with his clothes getting extremely tight.<br />
<br />
As he walk past the kitchen, Jeff looked back at his hands and found out that his hands were half peachy tan and half black and were getting bloated.  He could even see his fingers beginning to merge and was halfway curved.  He could also see the creases forming on the back of his hands, forming tire tracktion.  Suddenly, he heard his sneakers started to burst due the the tightness of his feet.  Jeff look down and was surprised at the fact that his feet were completely big and half rounded with his toes completely gone.  He was now having a hard time walking with his tire feet as he used the countertop in the kitchen for support with his deformed hands.  He could also feel his body expanding at an alraming rate with his clothes tearing up.  He looked at his watch and realized that it has been two minutes since his transformation had started.  Jeff had three minutes to get to the garage before the transformation is complete.<br />
<br />
The moment he thought of that, his watch snapped when his arm grew twice his normal size.  Not only that but when he looked up at the end of the arm where his deformed hand is connected to, he was loosing his normal tan color to a chrome like substance and spreading downward.  Putting that aside, he continued to reach the door leading to the garage.  Problem of the matter is that he no longer has any feet to speak of.  Instead, he had a pair of deformed tires that were expanding, making it difficult to walk.  So he slowly and surely took baby steps while hanging onto whatever for support, inching closer and closer to the door.<br />
<br />
As he was getting there, Jeff could feel the remnants of his shirt and jeans exploded in one final rip.  The only thing he had left was just his underwear, which was expanding to the breaking point.  At the same time, he could feel something growing on his back.  What it was is his back that was growing and curving into the hood of the car.  The change on his back was getting too heavy that Jeff was beginning to slouch lower.  Jeff knew it would be a matter of time before he gets onto four wheels.  He held on to the fridge with his changing arm and thought he had it all under control.  But the moment the chrome color reached his elbow and knees; there was a different change.  His elbows and knees began to bend into a different direction and twisted into the way the front and back wheels should look like.  In fact, the moment his legs changed directions, but it caused all of Jeff’s body to fall to the floor with a large thud.  Jeff shook his head and realized that he was on the ground on all four wheels.  He tried to move to see if he could make it.  To his surprise, he could still squirm, barely.  He still has time to make it to the garage before his change is complete.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely, Jeff crawled closer to the door.  As he was doing that, more changes begin to take place.  His hands have gone through one huge metamorphosis.  His fingers completely merged together and they joined with the bottom part of his hand to form a nearly complete tire.  At the same time, something metal appeared in the middle and covered the opening up completely.  The same goes with his feet as they turned into a complete circle and had a metal disk in the middle of it.  His body continued to expand further making him the size of a bed while his back continued to grow upwards.  This caused the remains of his boxers to tear itself open, revealing his nakedness.  Jeff could also feel his organs rearranging themselves and shape shifting into something else.  His nipples on his chest started to smooth out and vanished into thin air.  His muscles, which were a little thin for a teenager, stretched and flatten as well making them less noticeable.  Even his thin body hair detached itself from the skin and slowly floated downward.<br />
<br />
Jeff was just a foot away from the door leading to the garage when something was blocking his view.  From what he saw, multiple strands were raining down on him.  He looked down and realized that it was him own hair on the floor.  He was instantly going bald!  Before he could react, his neck snapped and lifted his head up in a straight position.  He tried to turn his head but it was stuck.  Jeff knew what this mean as his head was starting to grow.<br />
<br />
After a bit of a crawl, Jeff finally made it to the door leading to the garage.  He was lucky that not only he made it there, but also the door was opened a little bit so that he won’t have to use his hands.  All he has to do is to push it open and enter through it with no problems.  The only problem he has is that his body has expanded so much that it’s impossible to get through a thin door.  Suddenly, he could feel his body growing more by the second along with some other changes.<br />
<br />
His butt grew to a humongous proportation that it might look like that of a sumo wrestler, but that would soon change.  First, his butt hole was sealing itself up then the opening between his cheeks stick together and disappearing at the same time.  Jeff was now completely assless.  His penis then changed too.  When his change started, his dick started to erect all by itself without any sexual pleasures.  But then it started to grow longer and taking shape.  On instinct, it snapped itself and turned to the left and then snapped again to go down to the back end.  His testicles were changing as well as they were expanding and shaping into a cube like block.<br />
<br />
Jeff knew it was going to be a matter of time before his transformation is done, so he headed to the door to open it with his front face.  Once it was fully open, he had to think of a way squeezing through the door.  He sill has some movements on his arms and legs, even if they were half skin and half metal, and can move around with them for the moment.  So by extending his metallic arms through the door, he was able to pull his deformed head through the door successfully.  Continuously, he squirmed to get a little bit out of the door and to the other side.  He was just halfway there when his face continued to change.<br />
<br />
His head and neck grew incredibly wide to match the same mass as his ever-growing body.  His nose grew small and was flattening to a near opening.  Jeff’s eyes grew big and wide as his vision started to get blurrier and blurrier, leaving him permanently blind.  Jeff could feel his ears migrating backwards and positioning themselves at the front of where his growing back is and shaping into something else.  His mouth was forced open to reveal his teeth, which were all merging together and little diamonds were opening in a row.  He could also feel his brain squishing around, taking in a strange shape, and hardening into an engine.  After much effort, and last part of Jeff’s growing body made it through the door as he fell back down with a large thud.  He finally made it to the garage as the last of the changes took place.<br />
<br />
His hands and feet were long gone as the final form grew into a pair of tires with rims in the middle.  The last of his arms and legs went from being peach tan to silvery chrome as his arms and legs were forced to pull themselves into his body and remained there for the rest of their lives, at least up to three years.  Once his arms and legs were connected, a metal bar grew in the middle top and middle bottom, forming together to create a mechanism that operates the front and back wheels.  His dick slowly sticks out at the life of the left tire as the opening grew, loosing the mushroom head shape and becoming a wide cylinder.  Even his testicles were finished changing and was now nothing a rectangular tank.  The end result, Jeff’s privates was now a tailpipe and a fuel tank.  His body grew one final time as his back spasm and took on a sleek shape, turning into the body of Jeff’s dream car.  When that was complete, his peachy skin color was getting darker and shinier, turning into Jeff’s favorite color, red.  At the same time six opening, four from the side and two from the front and back, appeared after the back took shape and faded away.  This of course turned them into translucent windows showing the inside.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the inside of Jeff’s body changed as well.  During his change, Jeff’s organs grew, shaped, and harden into the interior of a car.  His lungs became leather seats, his hears turned into the front dashboard, his liver is now a steering wheel, and his stomach is now that of a middle console.  His face was long gone, replaced with the front section of the car.  His eyes were gone and replaced with a pair of headlights, his mouth was turned into a grill, and his nose became the exhaust for the engine in him.  Even his ears that moved back to the front mirror extended a little and harden with the inside filled up and covered in a reflected surface, making them review mirrors.  At the end of the transformation, other things appeared to accommodate the exterior of the car including doors, trunk, back highlights, door handles, an antenna, blinkers, and other features.  To top it off, the emblem of Chevrolet appeared on the front end of the hood.  Once the transformation was over, the reality around Jeff changed.  His bedroom turned into a study room with the Chronivac still on the desk and the memorize of him disappeared in the heads of his family and friends.<br />
<br />
In a matter of five minutes, Jeff was no longer human but was now his dream car, a 2010 Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZO6.  Jeff knew that he was completely changed but he couldn’t do anything about it.  He could no longer see, hear, smell, or taste anything as a car.  Only thing he can do is feel and wait, wait for someone to start him up and drive.  Suddenly, the door he entered opened up and someone entered the room.  But who is it?</p>
