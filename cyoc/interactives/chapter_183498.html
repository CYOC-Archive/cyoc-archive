<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daren thought he saw something break in Chris&#39;s eyes as he sat on his haunches, face covered in cum, whilst his mother cooed down the phone at what a good boy he was. But he knew it was illusory, he&#39;d ensured Chris kept a defiant streak and it was bound to resurface eventually. That was the fun part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m sorry boys I can&#39;t stay, his father will be back in a few minutes and I want to have his breakfast on. Chrissy?&quot; The deflated boy looked up at his mother. &quot;You be good for Daren, you did a good job today for him. You&#39;re very lucky he takes care of you as well as he does. Anyways, bye Christopher, love you!&quot; She lingered for moment, causing Daren to give Chris a nudge with his foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, yeah Mum, ah, love you too&quot; he said dejectedly. But Mrs.Shimizu didn&#39;t pick up on it, gave a smile and a little wave, and ended the call.<br />
<br />
Daren basked in the afterglow for a few minutes, quietly finishing his cigar whilst Chris slouched where he belonged, quietly at his feet. Finally he took one last, heavy drag, stubbed the butt of the cigar out in an the ashtry and then exhaled a gust of smoke straight into Chris&#39;s face, grinning as he did so. Chris despised smoking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; he cried angrily, getting some of his vim back and standing up, which only brought him to face level with the sitting Daren. &quot;Cut that out, that&#39;s fucking disgusting&quot;. Daren frowned, looks like some correction would be in order. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk back to me boy, and don&#39;t swear either&quot; Daren said quietly<br />
<br />
Chris caught the change in his demeanour and grew a little hesitant but that defiant streak mastered him. &quot;Or what? You&#39;re going to fuck me again? Thought I was supposed to FUCKING love that&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was a direct challenge from the little shit. He mentally notated it as strike two &quot;Little boys don&#39;t swear Chrissy. So watch your tongue and mind your manners or you&#39;ll regret it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chris puffed out his chest &quot;I&#39;m not a little boy you perverted fuck&quot;. Strike three.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have it your way then&quot; said Daren as he suddenly lunged forward and seized one of Chris&#39;s arms before he could react. There was no contest in strength. &quot;Hey, lemme go!&quot; Chris cried as he struck first at Daren&#39;s arm and then at Daren himself in a feeble, futile effort to get free. <br />
<br />
Daren forced the struggling boy over his knees, exposing his lily white rear, and held him in place with the flat of his a single palm.<br />
&quot;I can feel you getting hard again you sick freak!&quot; Chris shouted, and he was right, the situation was exciting Daren again, but this wasn&#39;t entirely about pleasure. Chris had to learn who was in charge here. With his free hand he scrabbled around for his phone, still sitting propped up from the call, and he opened it to the Chronivac and Chris&#39;s settings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what are you doing?&quot; Chris screamed as he saw Daren begin to fiddle with the device and he began to struggle even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;It occurs to me&quot; Daren said, &quot;that I really only need you to be this old if I want to fuck you Chrissy. But believe it or not, I don&#39;t like &#39;em too young. Being this old for you should be seen as a privilege, a reward for being a good boy, you get to try a few adult things.  But right now you&#39;re not being a good boy, you&#39;re being a very bad boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He found the age slider under Chris&#39;s settings again, and with his thumb he slid it backwards. The avatar of Chris dwindled once again, plumping out as a little bit of baby fat returned. This was a true child in the offing, sexless and immature, and it left Daren cold. <br />
<br />
&quot;And if very bad boys want to behave like children, then they&#39;re going to be treated like children!&quot;. He clicked submit, and Chris&#39;s weight diminished on his knees. &quot;Specifically&quot; he went on &quot;as a very naughty seven year old&quot;. Chris was now a squirming small boy held captive on his lap and he was trembling. Daren raised his hand. &quot;And bad boys have to be disciplined&quot;. He brought the flat of his palm down hard against Chris&#39;s shiny little bit and heard the high pitched yelp of pain and surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daren!&quot; Chris screamed as Daren waited for the red flush to fade a little, not wanting the next strike to cut into the old. He brought his palm down again, and there was another yelp! &quot;Please stop!&quot; Chris cried. Another strike, another yelp, and Chris burst into tears.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be good!&quot; he bawled on the fourth strike. &quot;I promise&quot; he said on the fifth. &quot;I&#39;ll be good&quot; he repeated on the sixth, each word enunciated between sobs. His butt was shiny and bright red. Daren removed his hand from his boyfriend&#39;s back, allowing the boy to slide off and back onto his feet. His kept his beet red face downcast, not daring to look at Daren and he kept bring his hand up to his face to wipe away snot.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll promise you&#39;ll be a good boy?&quot; Daren asked. Chris just nodded, his lips quivering. Daren brought him into a hug. &quot;I believe you.&quot; Chris leaned into him, coating his chest with tears and boogers, looking for comfort. &quot;Now I am sorry I had to do that, but bad boys get punished and you were being a very bad boy.&quot; He upchucked Chris&#39;s face so he could stare directly into those eyes. &quot;Weren&#39;t you being a very bad boy Chrissy?&quot;. He could see the adult in his eyes, that he didn&#39;t want to admit it, but Daren&#39;s eyes were hard and uncompromising and letting Chris know the wrong answer would have him back over his knee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah Daren&quot;, Chris stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes what?&quot; Daren demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...I was a very bad boy&quot;. He stood there, defeated, as Chris at last drew himself to his full height. He towered over his boyfriend. Daren ruffled his hair as any adult would do to any child they sought to comfort, knowing that it was humiliating. &quot;That&#39;s a good boy. I think I&#39;ll keep you like this for a bit Chris, as I said.&quot; Chris looked up wild eyed and disappointed. <br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ah ah&quot; Daren said, putting his hand over the lad&#39;s mouth. &quot;No buts, I&#39;ve made my decision and while you are my boyfriend, I&#39;m the adult, you&#39;re the child and I make the decision&quot;. Chris&#39;s protests died on his lips but not in his heart. &quot;Now, I&#39;ve plans for us today, so go get a shower and get yourself cleaned up. I&#39;ll take one when you&#39;re done&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was a command. Chris trudged sullenly out of the room he had entered as an adult and was leaving as a tot. When Daren heard the bathroom door close, he instantly grabbed hold of his penis and began rubbing furiously. He had told Chris the truth, he wasn&#39;t attracted to young kids. But the act of humiliating an adult trapped in the body of a child, demonstrating the sheer power imbalance, that drove him wild inside. With the kid safely in the shower, he mentally relieved punishing him and brought himself to a climax. Not much cum dribbled out of his dick , he&#39;d been going essentially non-stop since yesterday and his balls were aching. He needed a break. There were other things to do with Chronivac than sate his libido.</p>
