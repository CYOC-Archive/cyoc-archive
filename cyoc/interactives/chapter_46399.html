<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy stepped into the room with the bat symbol on it.<br />
<br />
Immediately as he entered, he knew something was wrong. He was in the middle of a forest, surrounded by trees and a few very eerie looking buildings around him. He looked behind him, but all that he could see was a giant mausoleum in the background.<br />
<br />
As soon as he turned around, he felt pangs of pain all around him. He felt weak, starved of something he needed, needed more than anything else in the world. And as he felt his canines grow longer and longer, felt his black get silkier and shinier, and watched his skin pale, even more than it had already been, he knew what he was missing.<br />
<br />
Blood.<br />
<br />
Entering into the Bat marked door had turned him into a vampire, obviously, but even more obvious was his desire for human blood. With a speed he had never before known, he flew through the forest, tracking on a scent he knew far too well--humans.<br />
<br />
As he burst through the forest onto the small town, he noticed how quiet and dead the town was. Perfect for making his move. He leapt up to a second story window nearby, and then pried it off of its hinges with no regard for subtlety. He pounced upon the small girl lying in bed, without making a sound, and began to drink her blood. Her felt her struggle against him at first, but she slowly grew more and more fatigued until all of the life had been drained out of her.<br />
<br />
But she was small. He needed more. He went to the bedroom of the girl's parents, and thrust open the door. He rushed forward to the bed and plunged his teeth into that of the mother lying in the bed before him. She screamed, which woke up her oaf of a husband. Jeremy didn't care. He needed the blood, and so he drank.<br />
<br />
The husband raced out of the room, down the stairs, and out into the town. Soon, an obnoxious clanging filled the silent air, almost distracting Jeremy from the prey at hand. But he drained her of her life, as well. Looking down, he saw that the entire village had gathered. More food, he thought.<br />
<br />
But as he descended, he felt a searing pain all over. Many of the villagers were wielding crosses, stars of David, and other religious tokens, which seared him to see. Others carried garlic, and many carried stakes made of wood. This was not looking good for Jeremy.<br />
<br />
As the villagers stood before him, stakes, pitchforks, and everything else they could wield descending upon him, he suddenly realized something.<br />
<br />
He was not a killer. He wouldn't do any of this. He wasn't a god-damn, blood sucking, child killing vampire! He didn't deserve to be killed like this! He was Jeremy, a high school senior with too much in front of him. He didn't even know how this had all happened, it had happened to him so fast. <br />
<br />
And he collapsed onto the ground, his body wrought with pain and utter confusion.<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Jeremy woke again on a cold, wooden floor. He was alive!<br />
<br />
But he soon wondered whether it had all been some sort of dream. Some weird, fucked up dream. He looked down and saw his clothes in tatters below him. What the hell had--<br />
<br />
And then suddenly, pain again. This time, he felt a pressure in his chest, and felt like his heart was racing, racing, racing. With each quickened beat his pectorals swelled outward, leaving him with a nicely defined chest. Not huge, and not a bodybuilders, but nicely defined. He felt a sharp pang in his stomach next, and watched as his stomach folded into a nice 2, 4, no, 6 pack, rock hard and shredded. His arms and legs followed, becoming more and more defined, not overly large but nice. <br />
<br />
Next, he felt a pang in his mouth. His canines grew out again, just as large as before. Shit. Was he still a vampire? Oh god no. He looked down, expecting to see pale skin, but instead saw tan skin, nicely bronzed. What the hell? Was he a vampire or not?<br />
<br />
&quot;You are indeed a vampire, Jeremy, though not in the typical sense of one. You are more attractive than the average vampire, though some swooning teenage girls may find that Edward Cullen character attractive. You also do not need to fear sunlight as a normal vampire would, though you may find yourself a little pained if you stay out too long. You can also hold a faith and eat garlic mashed potatoes without any fear. Most importantly of all, you do not drink blood. You drink fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fat? FAT? That's disgusting! Who the hell are you anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
A solemn, translucent figure appeared before him. <br />
&quot;I am Fredrick, the butler of this Mansion. And so you know, you can drink fat without causing much harm to anyone. Well, in moderation of course. Think of it as free liposuction. You have been freed from the curse of my old master, be thankful for that, Jeremy. By remembering yourself, you have freed yourself from eternity as a slave like I. Now, Jeremy, you should get your friend Mike and escape from this place, before any of you are trapped here forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GO JEREMY! GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
What does Jeremy do?</p>
