<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric yawned, trying his best to keep his eyes open. He was exhausted, but he&#39;d had a surprisingly good day, considering. Tag and Bix had spent the evening regaling him of everything he&#39;d been missing at Practice. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Eino, the smug reindeer from tryouts, had been pulled from Team Three to cover his spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s nowhere near as good as you, veli,&quot; Tag spoke with his mouth full of carrot. &quot;Though I can&#39;t wait to see his face when Rudy tells him to go back to Team Three.&quot; He snorted impolitely as Bix gave him a look, though looked amused despite of himself.<br />
<br />
They laughed together as the lights in the house suddenly blinked out, leaving them in the dark. Eric could still see decently well, as he saw Bix&#39;s and Tag&#39;s eyes glowing faintly back at him, their expressions looking confused. Just as suddenly, the lights returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; He asked to shrugs.<br />
<br />
The familial bond was strong, and Eric felt a newfound sense of safety and belonging that left his chest full and warm. Still, he couldn&#39;t help but keep looking towards the door.<br />
<br />
<i>Where was Clyde?</i> He hadn&#39;t seen him since the accident.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
He lay in bed after Tag and Bix had gone to sleep. They had practice again in the morning, after all, and needed to be up early. He rubbed slowly at his broken antler with a sigh, feeling the cracks and rough patches where the bone had been wrenched away. (Tag and Bix had both gone out of their ways to convince him that he still looked fine and that he&#39;d shed them soon anyway, and yes: they&#39;d regrow back next year as a full set of antlers. When he&#39;d asked to see the broken piece, however, he was informed that Clyde still had it.)<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t remember the actual crash. Just bits and pieces from before and afterwards, in a strange montage mostly filled with dizzy black.<br />
<br />
Despite his best efforts, he lost himself to sleep, hoping that he&#39;d see his reindeer tomorrow.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
He woke to soft, loving petting on his forehead as he blinked his eyes into focus, quickly realizing that Clyde sat next to him in the dim light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clyde! Owww...&quot; He had moved too quickly in his excitement. Ouch. Ok still very sore.<br />
<br />
Clyde looked concerned, but amused and relieved as he grinned over at him, leaning onto the bed to rest his arm as he continued tracing his fingers through the fur. &quot;Careful, Söpö. You&#39;re still injured.&quot; He leaned forward to oh so carefully put their heads together, though as their antlers rested together awkwardly, Eric felt self conscious again.<br />
<br />
Clyde sensed his worry and gave him a look that put him immediately at ease. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Aarre, you&#39;re still the sexiest Reindeer in the North Pole.&quot; He found himself blushing weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been, Clyde? I was starting to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reindeer looked a bit sheepish and shrugged. &quot;Rudy ordered me to go home at lunch today. Apparently I was a <i>&#39;danger to the team&#39;</i> if I <i>&#39;didn&#39;t get proper rest&#39;</i>&quot; he grimaced, &quot;I would have come over, but my Isä basically put me under house arrest until he was certain I&#39;d actually gotten some sleep. I&#39;m being forced to take tomorrow off as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric wanted to chastise his mate for not taking proper care of himself, but he couldn&#39;t summon the strength as they lightly ran their fingers against each other. He was happy to hear that his extended family was helping to look out while he was indisposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s worked in our favor, though,&quot; Clyde continued, &quot;Because Otso has given the OK for me to sleep here tonight. It might have to do with Michael spending more time at his place, but I&#39;m not going to look a gift elf in the eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric laughed lightly, feeling his heart flutter as he rested his head back on the pillow. For how tired he was, he was amazed his sheath found the energy to start to plump, but Clyde gave him a look as his nostrils flared. He reached out gently to trace the bump in the blanket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look who&#39;s also awake,&quot; He chuckled softly as Eric flexed his dick against the hooved finger before he crept forward carefully. &quot;I don&#39;t think Otso&#39;s cleared this, but what he doesn&#39;t know won&#39;t hurt him.&quot; He grinned as he pulled back the blanket, making sure he didn&#39;t disturb any of Eric&#39;s bandages.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have the stamina to take care of you properly,&quot; Eric protested as Clyde put up a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;All you need to do is just lay there, Sielunkumppani. I&#39;ll do the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde positioned himself between Eric&#39;s hooves at the foot of the bed and crawled forward, careful not to put any undue pressure on Eric&#39;s limbs as he leaned forward to brush his muzzle against Eric&#39;s balls and sheath, grunting low and closing his eyes as his ear flicked. He pressed his nose and breathed in deeply as Eric blushed, feeling self conscious about not being able to do much about his personal hygiene in his current situation.<br />
<br />
Clyde, however, seemed satisfied as he grinned up at Eric and moved forward to drag his tongue slowly up his length, which elicited a soft moan. He chuckled to himself, obviously pleased, and got to work as Eric watched, trying not to move too much.<br />
<br />
Using only his mouth, Eric was surprised at how thoroughly he was blown. He started to thrust into Clyde&#39;s muzzle, but stopped when he felt a hoof on his inner leg--a warning to stay still. With a quick glance, Clyde continued his ministrations, alternating between a quick bob and agonizingly slow. Eric sighed, dizzy from loss of breath, certain all of his blood was in his dick.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after that he was tensing, his side and shoulder protesting, as he shot into Clyde&#39;s throat with a grunt. The reindeer took the entire load, licking up any stray drips to ensure any of the incriminating evidence was gone. Then, acting as though nothing had just happened, a massive grin on his face, he tucked Eric back in, though he sported a very clear and prominent erection.<br />
<br />
Eric did his best to scoot over in the bed, or as much as he could, before patting the bed next to him. Clyde hesitated for a moment, but judging there to be enough room, climbed in next to him to lay on his side before petting Eric&#39;s chest fur and looking over at him protectively. He noticed the golden glint of the engagement bracelet through the fur on his reindeer&#39;s wrist.<br />
<br />
Eric fell back to sleep with a big smile on his face.</p>
