<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An hour later Tommy went back into his room to look what the three were doing.<br />
At first he noticed the chaos in the shoe. It looked like they had tryed to use the furniture to break out of the shoe. But there where only small cracks in the glass. That was when the trio noticed him. Promptly they started to plead for him to change him back, but Tommy just smiled and went back to his laptop. He needed to change something. <br />
Before the trio could do anything, the furnoture went back to their original places while the cracks repaired itself. Tommy had made the glass shoe unbreakable, so even if he just smashed it into the wall it would not get any new cracks. He also made the furniture stay in place, similar to the clothes the trio wore. <br />
But because he know that his brother wasn´t someone who read a lot, he gave them a special boardgame and cardgame that could change to what they wanted to play. The books could also change to what they wanted to read, meaning it wouldn´t be to boring for them.<br />
He then went back, but stayed out of sight from them to hear what they would talk about.<br />
They had noticed the newly appeared games in the shelf next to the books, but had instead tryed to use the furniture again to smash through the glass, with no luck. &quot;He has glued them down, just like that itchy clothes. He doesn´t want that we get out of here.&quot; They started swearing and calling Tommy names he didn´t know they would know about. When he decided to walk back into their line of sight, the instantly started to plead again.<br />
&quot;They think I´m an idiot.&quot; So he just ignored them for the rest of the day. They tryed to get the attention of Tommy´s and George´s mother when she came home, but like Tommy had said before she didn´t hear them. <br />
<br />
For the next days Tommy mostly ignored them. Everytime they saw him they started pleading again, stopping whatever they were doing before he entered. He had looked with the laptop what they did while he was away a few times, but they were either playing something out of boredom, were trying to sleep, cursing Tommy for their situation or trying to smash the glass with parts of the books or games. He hadn´t told them that they wouldn´t get the glass to break.<br />
Since there wasn´t any change in their behavior after a week, Tommy decided to change something else. While they were asleep he changed the glass from the inside, making it untransparent to them while at the same time changed it to look like it was bright outside, meaning they wouldn´t have a change in the light for now. To them it would be like the days never ended.<br />
<br />
When they woke up the next time, Tommy noticed their shocked faces about not seeing anything outside their prison beside the light. He heard them talking about the never ending light, asking themselves if Tommy had but some kind of lamp next to their prison to keep them up at all times. <br />
Over the next days they lost any sense of telling the time because of it. But that didn´t change anything about how the behave.<br />
<br />
After having waited for a month, Tommy decided to make one test with them. <br />
He let them be ported outside their prison and grow back to normal, keeping them in their sock-clothes while they were all asleep. When they woke up shortly later, they happily notice their changed surroundings and their normal size. But when they saw Tommy leave his room, they tryed to get to his laptop. They hoped to help themselves to get an advantage against Tommy. But Tommy had made it so that they froze all midstep when they were all inside his room. The test he had set up would make them freeze when the tryed to attack Tommy in any way or would try to go inside his room while he was away.<br />
When Tommy came back about half an hour later he laughed at their faces. &quot;Seems like you didn´t past my test. I wanted to know if you have changed your behavior, but it looks like you wanted to get to the laptop to change something. So I will just send you back.&quot; With that, Tommy ignored their horrified faces when he walked over to his laptop and started the chronivac. &quot;Now then, goodbye&quot; he said smiling while hitting enter. The trio just shrunk back to antsize with their clothes before being ported back into the shoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe they won´t change their behavior any time soon. It´s a pity.&quot; With that, he started to type another change into the chronivac for them. He changed their memory drastically by taking away any knowledge of living in the outside world, meaning that they would think they have ever lifed inside their glassprison. They would never know that there was an outside they could live in because he made them believe that the outside world was destroyed before they where born and as long as he didn´t change anything about it they would believe the three of them were the last life forms in their small save world. And with their glued clothes they would never have any sexual orientation because they don´t even know what is down there underneath the clothes. They would just life for eternity in the body of twenty year olds after they had reached this age. <br />
To the trio it was horrified to be back in their shoe but only for a couple of minutes before the new changes take place. With the memories sucked out they slowly started to change from looking horrified to smiling at each other before starting to live their life again as if nothing had happened. All their life was now divided in playing, reading, talking and sleping.<br />
Tommy watched their changing faces and how they happily start to play a game with a smile. They wouldn´t bother him ever again as long as he, the only person who know about them, would not change them back. And for now, he didn´t plan to anytime soon.</p>
