<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was curious and decided to test the amulet with the clothes of a missing child Matt Greew.  Matt was only 12 years old and had been missing for over three months.  Rick touched the amulet to the clothes and then to his body and watch the change occur.  <br />
<br />
Rick shrank down to 4’ and 6” tall his muscles wasted away and his clothes were hanging loose on his small frame.  Rick’s hair changed to blonde and his body was becoming hairless.  He was shocked when he saw his boy cock, it was a little longer than his old one at about 7” erect.  Rick was surprised that the young boy had such an amazing unit.  It was thin like a dry erase marker and had two baseball nuts underneath.  Rick took in the 12 year olds naked body before putting the clothes on and calling the police to report himself.<br />
<br />
Matt stood there naked as the cops pulled up.  He told a story about a dark room and being touched on his penis and butt.  He demonstrated as he told the officers.  He could tell the men were in awe of his long cock.  They eventually made him cover up.  Matt was hard, he could see every one stealing glance of his penis.  It didn’t take long before his father and mother arrived with his older brothers (16) and sister (17) and her boyfriend (18).  <br />
<br />
“Son” Matt’s dad Ian said as he walked to his boy and hugged him tight. Matt’s towel dropped off and again he was naked and eventually stiff “where were you?”  Matt looked at his family and said “they did bad things to me and my body” he looked down “they were so mean and hurt my penis”. At the word, everyone looked down at the boys boner. It was not intentional.  The older boys looked surprised and couldn’t take their eyes off it.  Matt’s dad talked to the police and then put Matt in the car and took him home.  <br />
<br />
Once home, still wrapped in the blanket, Matt’s father said “let’s clean you up.”  He took Matt to the bathroom and started the shower.  He moved Matt’s naked body into the water.  Matt stood at attention as his father began to rub soap on his back down to his lower back.  Then his phone went off “hold on” he said and then he walked away.  Matt was standing in the water half soaped up as he felt a hand on his butt.  He looked back and saw his sister’s boyfriend Mike.  “Hey” Mike said “thought you could use some help” he smirked before pulling his pants down to expose his massive manhood.<br />
<br />
Mike was over 10” long and as thick as a baseball batt.  He had two smaller balls but they were still the size of golf balls.  He put Matt’s little boyhood to shame .  Mike reached around and gave Matt’s boner a squeeze “bet you thought you were a big man? Nah I’m the big man in your house.”  Mike took Matt’s balls in his hand and squeezed them until Matt dropped down in pain.  Mike’s massive meat was now at eye level, Matt was staring at it as his father walked back in “what the fuck!” He exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Just showing your boy who the real man of this house is!” Mike said “unless you’re going to show me up.”  Mike was cocky.  He pushed his hips forward and his tip made contact with Matt’s lips “this little fag is going to learn his place.”  Matt looked at his dad as he felt Mike grab the back of his head and push his cock into his mouth.  Ian was silent.  Mike was not “drop them” he ordered as Matt began to suck the big meat.  Ian was resistant before Mike smacked Matt’s head “now!” He ordered as the boy winced.<br />
<br />
Ian was 5” hard and thinner than a market.  He had large peach sized balls that were too big for his size.  “I’m bigger” Mike gloated “call in your other boys.”  Ian resisted before Mike called out to Ryan and Rich. The twin brothers were both shocked as they entered the room.  “Get naked cucks” Mike said with authority.  The two boys were at a loss for what to do so they obeyed.  Mike laughed at the sight.<br />
<br />
Ryan and Rich had muscular body’s, thick legs and arms and six packs.  They were both very little in the penis department though.  The twins were both short and thin at only 2” long with only marble size balls tucked tight around their shafts.  “Fuck that’s is sad” Mike moaned pushing Matt’s head off his big manhood “looks like I’m the man of this house” he sneered as he shook his glistening cock.  “I’m going to make you watch me rail your sister” he added and called out to Becca.<br />
<br />
Becca walked in to the bathroom and was sleachless.  Her younger brothers were all there naked and they had the smallest baby cocks.  Even her dad was small compared to her boyfriend.  “I’m going to breed you” Matt said and Becca was shocked as her father was not doing anything to stop, his own small cock rock hard.  <br />
<br />
Matt laid Becca down in front of the men in her family and he made them watch as he pushed the big rod between his legs in her pussy.  Becca moaned out in pleasure as he went deeper into her, stretching her cunt out.  “I’m the fucking man of this house” Matt moaned as he pumped his big cock in and out “you know you can’t resist my cock impailing your cunt”. Matt was pumping fast now all of the boys were rock hard watching their sister get turned out.  Matt began to cum. His ass clenched and be blew a few ropes inside bride pulling out and shooting on the used vagina his load was massive.  Matt looked at Becca’s brothers and father and said “you cucks lick off my cum”. He smiled as the twins moved into position and began to eat up the hot load.  Ian was next and Matt pushed him to the girls cunt “lick my sauce out.”   Next he looked at Rick “lick my manhood clean” he stood and pushed his still big cock towards Rick who began to lick it.  “That’s right bitches” Matt sneared as he watched the men humiliate themselves.</p>
