<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was tired of going by her mortal designation it stood for Tyler who is almost dead and gone she thought for a few minutes and decided on Whoriana which at a effortlessly focused god thought she became the gender fluid, coveted and desired ethereal embodiment of carnal lust, procreation, human humility, charity, fear, love, war, and occasionally fire to most of the humans wanted to leave room for heritics she could punish when she is bored by the worship sex and the sacrifice of family members for her sexiness (holiness) to warp, alter, morph, fuse, and control as she pleased. Whoriana liked everything on that list but shooting flames at your enemies instead of something creative like painfully transforming them into say hermaphroditic hillbilly anthro pig skanks seemed prosaic to her and a waste of good boundless god power.<br />
<br />
She teleported to the venue and found that was once big enough no longer satiated her goddess tastes. She blinked and the venue became twice the size of and design of the Roman colosseum except with etchings of your heroic god status and busts transmuted from air molecules into ageless indestructible busts in honor of your also ageless unifying beauty.<br />
<br />
Whoriana inspected her effortless architecture work  on the gold and platnum collisseum to teach the annoying little kids you had to tolerate for an hour, prisoners, thieves, and the blastphemous the lesson of &quot;Humility&quot; Whoriana knows she is a bad deity but she absorbed the power of the rest and she is now unparalleled in all the universe she ate all the deity energies from the gods, Titans, Oni, and demons in her endless lust for power she will teleport the mortal remains from the remnant gods that became naughty mortals.<br />
<br />
She was looking at her dainty, perfectly manicured and painted with melted platinum fingernails svelte nimble soft feminine fingers and remembered when she couldn&#39;t contain or control her power that was bouncing around inside of her and it made the fearless goddess shutter the monsterous wolf musk that made people gag and throw up unlike her fluids that makes them salivate and beg. Now her penis ejaculates a powerful glowing white ocean of her nymphomania inducing, corrupting and physically altering godly nectar that may make you bisexual or turn you into a psychopath regardless of the outcome you always become a sex obsessed nymphomaniac from two small condensed god testicles that acted like pocket dimensions for her vast guysered blessing in front of people chanting praying, and predominantly and most importantly fornicating with each other which is how you properly show Whoriana your devotion. <br />
<br />
She inspected her body from the outside she thought she needed something sexier she snapped her dainty perfectly god infused fingers and her signature thong bottoms and micro bikini top altered becoming a little thicker and laced with strips of fur, leather, jewelry, precious metals, and rare Gems she looked outside and decided to go up a few cup sizes extend her smooth powerful penis to twelve inches and thickened to the girth of a massive magical coveted god kielbasa she entered third perspective out of body and while she has a god&#39;s digestive system she has been turning too many heritics into cheese burgers and fries which she will binge on because her demonic side thrives off of devouring souls  leaving her paunchy since she&#39;s a young goddess she&#39;ll slim down for the plebians she willed her midsection down to a chiseled six pack, and bigger hips and a bigger softer yet firm and taught booty that will seamlessly meld into her bigger and more powerful thighs. A snap of her feminine platnum encased nails and everything felt orgasmic as her chest swelled up to big, soft, unaturally natural,perfectly perky and symetrical Z cups and Whoriana liked how light giant breasts are when your a god. Her penis felt tingly, warm and sweet as it finished off at a foot even and gained the girth of a Polish sausage, then her divine thighs ached with pleasure and the feeling traveled up to her butt where her butt cheeks grew larger while retaining it&#39;s firmness and shape she scrunched her cute nose and willed her clothes bigger. She looked at herself out of body and loved what she saw but didn&#39;t like how her massive breasts blocked her firm battle goddess six pack instead of reducing her love god  giant cleavage she simply willed herself taller shooting up to 8 feet even upon self inspection she was drooling over her own tall,curvy, busy divine form she exclaimed &quot;I look good!&quot; In her soft, angelic, sweet, hypnotizing, powerful voice  the arousal of seeing herself and looking at her now foot long penis bulge triumphant towering at attention almost exposing the entire shaft as it rests massively in front of her curvy,thick, powerful,blemish/imperfection/cellulite free legs made her vagina moist which works in tandem with the penis to both get aroused at the same time but her sex organs orgasm in shifts she only produces 2,000,000 gallons of transformative trans goddess semen a day which is more than the average person needs but Whoriana&#39;s semen causes vivid visions, euphoria, and some batches can cause random transformations and physical reincarnations of the devoured if she eats too many souls the following night and gets demon goddess indigestion which are sought after and considered as a rarity and what is considered a way to get closer to the all goddess mother Whoriana and protector of the universe. Her other juices from her areolas and vaginal juices are revered and lauded by a secretive cult. The cultists believe that the juices Grant you powerful visions, euphoria, and connectivity to the almighty Whoriana at the side effect of becoming sluttier and fatter on repeat use until your a morbidly obese hermaphrodite bimbo and a nymphomaniac nudist that either gets selected to be a high priestess of Whoriana during processing, eventually the user becomes a disembodied crazed spirit that aimlessly floats around or more likely gets abducted by black market profiteers to be crushed and squeezed into a hyper reactive byproduct that makes you an obese nympho after the ingestion of a single bottle and to emulate her curves and bust are common since their goddess made most of them love her.<br />
<br />
Whoriana has changed the zeitgeist of earth society where fat promiscuous people are valued over the fit and prudish. People are stuffing themselves and acting skanky to fit in hoping someone would mistake them for a &quot;juicer&quot; and thus popular. The goddess had a show for her devotees tonight. She was fondling her massive weightless breasts and altering her gem and ore encrusted micro bikini by will to snug tightly against her massive perfect lactating breasts that are extremely supple yet perky Z cups that she is in love with big boobs are fun as a powerful goddess that can make them act like they are in zero gravity. <br />
<br />
She stalled enough to the point where she was somehow boring herself she clapped her hands loudly and suddenly everyone she willed frozen were summoned from the space time pocket appeared in the collisseum the kindergarten kids began freaking out and crying. This annoyed Whoriana very much she willed them to shut up and be still eyes glowing wildly and flashing vivid colors. They did what was asked but at this point she was expecting the crowd to be bigger instead of destroying a city with a sneeze she realized that the auditorium was small, she was a teenager loser boy then not a goddess, and lastly not all the punished were present she wanted to flush most of the turds in one go. She took her dainty arm and snapped her platnum adorned fingers making a million other spectators fill seats and all the people who pissed her off and people that were on the list before her god status were lined up awaiting her creatively evil retribution. <br />
<br />
It was weird some people were confused and freaked out like your former foster family members, even the powerless old gods were panicked making it all the more funny that every adult and teenager were flipping out while the kindergarten kids were standing at attention calm as Hindu cows awaiting something horrible to befall them.</p>
