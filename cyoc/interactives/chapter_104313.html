<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About fifteen minutes later, Ryan pulled up at the edge of the town at the side of the road. Switching off the car engine, he looked meaningfully at Claire, wanting to drink in the image of her young, captivating face before he introduced her into the werewolf race. Before she saw what he had to show her.<br />
<br />
“Come on,” he urged. “We’ve just got a short walk before we reach a special place. I hope you’ll like it.”<br />
<br />
Puzzled, but keen to see what Ryan had in store for her (and that was besides the physical activity she know was nearly upon them, she told herself), Claire gave a quizzical smile, and got out of the car – sticking close to Ryan as he led her into the tree line alongside the road. Besides the moon shining down on them, there were only a few streetlights close by to guide them as she followed her…boyfriend… Yes, she had no hesitation in calling Ryan that now – despite only knowing him for a few days. And soon, he would be her lover. Her…mate. Her werewolf mate. <br />
<br />
The thought made her shiver with tingly excitement, and Claire paused to dab her handkerchief against her flushed face. She was really going to go this! She was going to become like Ryan and Barbara – a half-human, half-animal hybrid, like something out of a horror novel. But she was not going to become a monster. No. She would still retain her mind, still be able to talk as a human. She would still be herself. Claire’s mind flashed back to the previous Friday night, when she had inadvertently stumbled across the werewolf lovers, Eric and Cassie, in the woods. She had fled then, fearing for her life in her shock and terror. Now she knew that the werewolves and the other law-abiding were-creatures of the town would not hurt her. Instead, she would also become a beautiful lupine huntress herself. The local woods and forests would be her natural habitat, and she looked forward to sharing those nights with Ryan, Barbara, and in the company of the other werewolf friends she hoped to make. She looked forward to getting to know Eric, Cassie, and their circle, as a friendly equal…<br />
<br />
Stop pounding so fast, heart! Claire told herself as she tried to take another deep breath and calm herself. Right now, you’re being more of a jittery mouse than a would-be wolfess!<br />
<br />
“Stick close to me, Claire,” Ryan advised her as they followed the trail through the wood. He paused and pulled out a torch, switching it on. “Once we’re both furred, neither of us will have problems seeing in the dark – especially with the moon being out. But we need to make sure we don’t step outside of the town limits here. We sometimes have ferals who might attack anyone they come across. But they know well enough not to come into the town itself.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Claire snuck closer to Ryan and entwined her arm with his. “Close enough?” she teased him. <br />
<br />
“We’ll be needing to be even closer than that, soon enough.” He grinned back.<br />
<br />
“Whoa. Down boy! You’re starting to make me feel hot again, already.”<br />
<br />
The feeling’s mutual… Ryan silently told himself. <br />
<br />
They walked on, following the trail until they turned a bend and reached the bank of a stream. Claire’s eyes widened as she took in the sight and roar of a three-meter high waterfall, almost hidden in the dark of the night, underneath the green lushness of the tall trees on either side of the gully. A pair of owls hooted nearby. Claire drank in the sight of the rushing water downstream from the fall in the clearing - and the freshness in the air. All underneath the enchanting moon that she hoped to sing out her joy to, along with Ryan, before the night was out.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my! It’s lovely,” she exclaimed. She turned to face Ryan. “So…, is this where you intend to…”<br />
<br />
“…make you a were, yes.”<br />
<br />
“Aware of what?” Claire smirked, cocking her head.<br />
<br />
“Ha ha. Make you aware of the joys of being a werewolf, Claire,” Ryan grasped her hands and kissed her on the forehead. “I come here sometimes when I’m troubled and need to relax. It’s also where I first changed when my wolf stirred himself into life. I was just four at the time. I’m glad you like it. The cool air should help you when the fever of your change kicks in.” He paused. “Have you had any…experience of…?”<br />
<br />
“This will...this will be my first time – with a man. I…I experimented with another girl, once – but that made me realise it wasn’t for me. I’m…I’m still technically a virgin,” she admitted.<br />
<br />
“I will be gentle as you want me to be, Claire,” Ryan promised her. “Now, there are some things you need to know. After we’ve made love, there will be some time before you change – the amount varies between people. Also, the change will leave you hungry. One reason I’ve brought you here is so that we can hunt for squirrels, mice, or rabbits. We do have a breeding programme in place here, to ensure that the carnivore were-creatures never go short of small game. Are you okay with that?”<br />
<br />
Claire nodded. “Sure am. I’d rather snack on animals than humans…”<br />
<br />
“You won’t feel the urge to slaughter people, trust me. We only have a few rogues – and that’s mainly because they were people who weren’t suitable for the ‘gift’,” Ryan informed her. “Now – in becoming a werewolf, do you swear to me Claire Robertson, that you will keep the secrets of this town safe from normal humans, unless authorised to tell them by a town elder?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Ryan. I do.” Still holding to Ryan’s hand with her left, Claire placed her right hand over her pounding heart.<br />
<br />
“Do you swear to avoid hurting or even killing anyone – regardless of their species – unless it is in the defense of yourself or your loved ones?”<br />
<br />
“I do solemnly swear this,” Claire promised.<br />
<br />
“And do you swear that you will not force a normal human being to become a were-creature against their will?”<br />
<br />
Claire nodded. “I do.”<br />
<br />
“These are the laws that have helped to long provide a sanctuary for the various were-creature species that happily co-exist in this town, Claire. Breaking them will result in imprisonment and other punishments, as decided by the town elders. And it will be my duty as part of the local police force, to help to enforce the laws. Even against you, if I had too…,” declared Ryan. <br />
<br />
“I know, and I understand. I’m under no illusions at all about what I’m letting myself in for, Ryan. It’s just…”<br />
<br />
“Go on,” he urged her. “You don’t have to hold anything back now.”<br />
<br />
“It’s silly, really,” Claire giggled nervously. “All of the were-creature women seem to be well-endowed. Well, the ones that I’ve seen…”<br />
<br />
“Not all of them are. You probably just saw the bustier ones, or the vain types who seek out breast implants to further inflate themselves...,” Ryan muttered. “Barbara’s shape is natural – but I know some were-creature ladies who have an average human female bust.” He stopped, and thought about Claire’s undeveloped chest. “Are you worried how you will look, after…?”<br />
<br />
She nodded. “I would like to grow a bit, but I don’t want to have overlarge breasts! Furry or not. But I don’t know how you would feel about that, given that Barbara’s pretty big…”<br />
<br />
“Come here, silly,” Ryan sighed, hugging Claire to him. “Not all men prefer their ladies with exaggerated curves. I love Barbara for who she is, as well as being as being a loyal werewolf friend. What people are like on the inside is more important – although naturally for me, them being furry is a bonus!” He winked, and then turned serious. “However you turn out physically as a wolf-woman, I will love you for being you, Claire!” <br />
<br />
“Thanks, Ryan.” Claire smiled as he brushed away her tears of anxiety. “I’m not a natural with being naked – but… I’m ready now.”<br />
<br />
He nodded. “Time to undress, then.”<br />
<br />
They got to work, dropping their jackets and taking off their shoes – before the couple decided to start unbuckling each other’s belts and unbuttoning their upper clothing. Two pairs of hands roamed, caressing blonde hair and black hair, and rubbing skin exposed to the cool night air of the woods as the nearby waterfall continued its never-ending gush over the small rocks and flowed swiftly onwards along the stream. Before flying off, one owl saw the pants and jeans being kicked upon the grass below – to be joined soon afterwards by Ryan’s boxer shorts and Claire’s dark knickers. Stretching themselves out on the grass, the young couple kissed each other’s necks, and Ryan – feeling his libido increasing – licked his tongue slowly around Claire’s flat stomach, before he teasingly crawled up and did the same to her slim breasts. Next he carefully nipped her nipples.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Claire gasped in pleasure. “Don’t stop, Ryan. I won’t mind…I won’t mind if you even bite my neck when your fangs kick in. It seems right that you should.”<br />
<br />
“Okay. But I’ve got somewhere else to go first, before that happens,” Ryan declared, giving the sideways grin that Claire and Barbara adored - before he bent down and slowly stroked his hands in small circles on Claire’s inner thighs, gradually moving closer to her privates. Seeing her face glowing with mounting excitement as she kneaded his own nipples and firm abs, Ryan then lightly ran his fingers around Claire’s folds and stretched his head down to kiss her there. As he licked gently at her clitoris he was rewarded by Claire’s sharp intake of breath and her wetness - and the smell of her made his wolf surge to the surface of his own being. His skin prickled as his fur erupted from his pores.<br />
<br />
Not yet! He growled to himself. But Claire grinned and kissed him on the lips, hard. Nuzzling his jaw, she gave a playful growl herself, before nipping his ear – which made Ryan instinctively respond in kind to her. Next, she grabbed hold of his lengthening erection – then moved her hand to stroke the grey and white fur that was sweeping outwards from Ryan’s groin in a wave, cloaking him more and more with each passing second. He felt the other part of his transformation kicking in – the familiar ache of his shifting bones and internal organs, the straightening of his coccyx and the sudden emergence of his tail bone from the surrounding, now-hairy, flesh. His hands, feet and limbs crunching – shortening in some places, whilst lengthening elsewhere. His height and mass had increased only slightly from his human form. <br />
<br />
Before his claws could penetrate his lover’s flesh, Ryan recovered his breath, and shifted his transforming body so that his malehood was poised to enter Claire’s vagina. “Ready?” he asked her, his voice already a little deeper.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely. I’m not backing out,” Claire gasped, feeling herself drowning in a wave of passions that was already exceeding those she experienced outside the hospital. <br />
<br />
Acting as one without further words, Ryan hugged Claire as he turned onto his furred back, taking her with him. Next, Claire carefully lowered herself on Ryan’s erect, throbbing malehood, until she felt the pressure against her hymen. She thought of her dream, where she had seen herself as a proud, strong wolf-woman. The image filled her with even more excitement and desire.<br />
<br />
This is it! She told herself. My last moment as a normal human being. Without any further pause, she pressed herself down and completed the locking of their bodies. Claire gave a cry of pain – but the agony was soon swept aside by her ever-increasing joy as Ryan’s head and face shifted into his wolfman form. Her human cry joined in and blended with his howl. The tips of his fangs then gently broke the skin near to her collarbone, and he licked at the trickle of blood until the wound began to heal.<br />
<br />
Now they concentrated on finding their joint rhythm as they rocked their hips against each other. Moaning, Claire and Ryan flopped to one side upon the grass – and it wasn’t long before they managed to simultaneously climax, their ecstatic voices carrying above the constant roar of the waterfall…<br />
<br />
