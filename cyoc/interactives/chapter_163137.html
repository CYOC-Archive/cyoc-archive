<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, we have a whole week to try other ages, might as well both stick to thirty.&quot; Marc tapped away at the tablet and tossed it onto the bed. &quot;So how long before.. oh..&quot; Mark was suddenly stretching out, putting on a bit more height and growing a bit broader, one last growth spurt from puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty quick.&quot; Edwin responded with a deep laugh.<br />
<br />
Mark was a swimmer. Tallish, he had a lean build and that seemed to be carrying on into adulthood as his body continued to grow. His shorts were riding a bit high up his thighs and there was a gap of a couple of inches between his shirt and his waistband. The other thing about Mark being a swimmer is he kept himself shaved down. Edwin had no idea how hairy or not his friend was, but that exposed bit of flat stomach had a wide line of dark blond hair going down the middle.<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s shaggy hair in opposite to what happened to Edwin&#39;s grey longer, now brushing his shoulders in blond waves. Without even thinking about it, he tucked it behind his ears. It seemed Mark also kept fit as he got older, as his t-shirt was straining against larger pectorals, hugging the flat planes of muscle tightly, the fabric stretched out to near breaking, but Mark was more concerned about getting off his suddenly too tight shorts. Dark blond hair had grown in along his shins and up to his thighs, which were still thickly muscled like a swimmer&#39;s. Mark finally got the shorts off and tossed them to the floor.<br />
<br />
A thick, but trimmed, almost brownish-red pubic bush had grown in around Mark&#39;s just somewhat above average cock. A cock which was standing at a rigid seven inches. Edwin couldn&#39;t blame his friend, he knew how good the transformation felt, especially the feeling of muscles building with strength.<br />
<br />
Finally the fabric stretched over Mark&#39;s chest gave way, exposing a pair of pectorals dusted in blond hair. Mark tore the rest of the shirt down, exposing a tight six pack with a wide treasure trail connecting his chest hair to his crotch. Without even thinking he had an audience, Mark grabbed on to his cock and began to stroke.<br />
<br />
He had to struggle a little to get the rest of his shirt off his thicker arms, especially with one hand somewhat occupied, breathing a sigh of relief once it was completely off. His other hand ran through the curly blond hair covering his chest, tweaking one of his nipples with a moan.  A beard started growing in on his face as well, at first neatly trimmed like Edwin&#39;s, but soon growing a bit fuller and scruffier. With the long hair he had a sort of rugged, hipster viking thing going on that Edwin had to admit looked good on his friend.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the changes came to a halt. Mark was taller than Edwin, but not as heavily muscled, he was leaner, and with some annoyance on Edwin&#39;s part had only size twelve feet. He also wasn&#39;t as hairy, he wasn&#39;t smooth by any stretch, but Edwin was definitely furrier, and Edwin&#39;s darker hair only made that more obvious. Falling back on the bed, Mark shot his load, cum splattering into his newly grown chest hair as he came down from the high of the transformation. &quot;Fuck.. did I just.. Oh god, dude I&#39;m..&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin just grabbed a towel from nearby and lofted it at Mark with a laugh. &quot;I did the same thing. Might want to shower though. It sucks when that dries in body hair. I learned that this morning. Not like we haven&#39;t seen each other naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark blushed a little as he grabbed the towel and covered himself. &quot;Locker rooms are different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the guy that wants to hit the nude beach.&quot; Edwin gestured at the tablet. &quot;I&#39;d order some clothes, too, especially if we&#39;re going to the bar tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark picked up the tablet and quickly made a few selections as Edwin watched him, seemingly lost in thought. Finished, he got up and headed to the bathroom, only stopping for a moment as he caught his reflection in the mirror, stroking his beard and turning this way and that. &quot;Damn, if I new I looked this good hairy I would have given up the shave routine a while ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin picked up a pillow and threw it at Mark, beaning him in the head. &quot;Go shower, I want to hit the damn beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark slipped inside the bathroom to take that shower, though by the way the water was splashing and the soft moans that the door didn&#39;t quite stop, Edwin figured Mark was enjoying his manhood again. It was taking long enough that the clothing delivery arrived before Mark was out of the shower, and the new selection of clothing was waiting for him on the bed. He selected a pair of floral print shorts and a black tanktop that showed off his arms, the neck cut low enough to expose the top of his furry pectorals.<br />
<br />
Edwin already had some beach towels and things ready to go, having made up his mind that would be their next stop. &quot;So... adult beach?&quot; Edwin asked, holding up a pair of swim trunks. &quot;Or nude beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark just grinned. &quot;With bodies like this.. nude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin dropped the swim trunks and picked up the towels. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get going, sun&#39;s high and there&#39;s a bar on the beach.&quot;</p>
