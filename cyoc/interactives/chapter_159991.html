<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I wasn&#39;t planning on continuing this since I thought it was a literary dead end, but thinking back on the mind alteration inspired me to write this. In the middle of it all, I surprised myself by coming up with the idea about the horses, which opened the story back up to progression! (as well as a really, really weird way of thinking that I hope I was able to explain successfully) <br/>
</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The insincerity of her own reply caught Jen by surprise. Her animalistic pride was one thing, but to hear herself speaking like that to her mother was another. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry, mother. I didn&#39;t mean to be so rude. What I meant to say was that I shall endeavor to produce more milk and semen as rightfully befitting a true stallion mare.&quot;<br />
<br />
There, she thought. That was the correct response, nodding to herself with satisfaction. <br />
<br />
Her mother replied, &quot;Thank you, honey. I know you will. I&#39;m proud just knowing you&#39;re always doing your best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen knickered happily, still not quite aware of how her mind had been altered. <br />
<br />
Before, the many animals that composed her body lay beyond the threshold of her mind, waiting to enter. When Jen’s own body began to fuck itself of its own accord, it was not so much Jen losing control of her own body as it was the animals within her sensing opportunity. They banged at the door, demanding to be let in, the fervor of each animal joining and multiplying upon another. <br />
<br />
Their mismatched traits intermixed to create unique sensations that no living being, much less Jen, could have ever prepared for. Soon the banging had turned to battering and with one last push, and a series of seemingly endless mind shattering orgasms later, they had blown the doors of Jen’s mind wide open, where they now resided. <br />
<br />
Now, they were more than parts of Jennifer in body; Jennifer was also the animals in mind. The lived memories of each animal filled her mind, as real and vivid as her human memories, altering her perception and reasoning in ways her former self wouldn’t have recognized. <br />
<br />
She remembered life as a normal teenage girl and being cursed by Kyle into a freak. But she also remembered life as a frail calf and growing into a prize-winning milk cow. She remembered her life as an elephant at the local zoo, and eventually growing discontent and breaking free. To a certain extent, she even remembered her lives as snakes and insects, though those were mostly instinct and learned behaviors which resided quietly in the background. <br />
<br />
Above all, she remembered her lives as wild horses, running free across the plains. As a stallion, he had been the dominant male, impregnating all the mares in the herd with his potent seed. The mare she now shared memories with had, in fact, belonged to his herd, where she was the lead mare. She remembered being captured by humans, while simultaneously remembering breaking off from the herd to search for her. They were reunited now, sharing the same body, and she – they – were happy. <br />
<br />
Jen recalled being mated by the lead stallion as the lead mare. At the same time, she remembered mating the lead mare as the lead stallion. Having memories of both was surreal. Or at least it was supposed to be. It felt natural more than anything. It was why her horse parts were so compatible, and why the scent of one aroused the other. She could feel herself growing simultaneously wet and hard just from the memories alone. <br />
<br />
Her reverie was interrupted by her mother – her human mother. This person was now one mother amongst others responsible for the lives within her, which reality had been quick to adjust to.<br />
<br />
“I got a fresh batch of Honeycrisp apples that I think your herd would love, especially your horse mother-in-life. Do you mind bringing it to them?” asked her human mother. <br />
<br />
Jen couldn’t wait to see the rest of her herd again. “I’d love to!” she replied. She had been away from her herd and mother – her horse mother – for far too long. <br />
<br />
But wouldn’t that mean she would end up absorbing them too? Actually, that didn’t sound too bad. It&#39;d be like one big homecoming! She smiled at the thought. <br />
<br />
They proceeded outdoors to where the apples waited. The morning sunlight aroused her snakelike horsecocks. The warmth felt amazing, but they knew an even better, warmer place to relax. One slipped into her horse cunt, followed shortly by another, filling it to capacity. Having nowhere else to go, the last one pressed up against the thick fleshy ring of her asshole. It spread the tight, sensitive doughnut apart slowly but forcefully, before burying itself deep inside and cumming a few times.<br />
<br />
Jen huffed from the brief pleasure. Despite it being her first self-anal penetration, it didn’t faze her in the least. Her reptilian parts were content with the comforting warmth of her inner depths, and her horse parts were together, just as they were supposed to be, and in more ways than one. It just felt right. <br />
<br />
Besides, the human part of her mind rationalized, this was better than having them wave around while travelling across several miles. Plus, anal sex turned out to be way better than the videos online suggested. She giggled, squeezing her back legs together. Her reptilian brain grew annoyed by the sudden disturbance, but it was overruled by her equine brain. The sensations were delicious, and no doubt she would fill herself with plenty of horse cum on the journey. <br />
<br />
Soon Jennifer was ready. With saddlebags on her flanks, hydration pack on her back, elephant cocks wrapped around her horse chest, and horsecocks tucked away inside herself, Jen set off to find her herd.</p>
