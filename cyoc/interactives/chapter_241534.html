<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer groaned and yawned loudly when she woke up. The room felt colder than it did yesterday. Jennifer had to tug her blanket even tighter around her body to make herself warm. The room look emptier than yesterday. Jennifer raised her blanket and saw that she wasn’t wearing anything anymore. The T-shirt she used as her pajama had vanished.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be good. I hope Kyle would… would… Kyle… Woah… Kyle… Mhmmm… What about Kyle...” Jennifer said as she felt her body suddenly melting in a funny way.<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn’t describe the feeling by any other way as it felt as if she was surrounded by sugary honey syrup that was spread all over her body. A perfume like scent was coming out of Jennifer that made her experience something she hadn’t ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
Jennifer giggled to herself as she laid on top of the bed and enjoyed the small moment her body was providing to her.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s that nice smell and where&#39;s it coming from… Ugh… Huh? Wait a minute… That’s… It&#39;s...? It&#39;s ME!?” Jennifer gasped and returned back to her normal self as her mind adjusted to the changes. “Why do I smell so sweet and where is it coming from? My arm pit? Maybe. Tummy? I guess. Crotch..? Uhmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; Jennifer realized that her crotch was producing some kind of strong perfume-like aphrodisiac. &quot;If I go to school like this I’m sure that It’ll attract all the boys for sure.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer wanted to jump out of her bed but the chilly air was forcing her to stay inside her bed. Jennifer touched her forehead and felt that her head was warm. Did she have a fever or was it something else. Jennifer ran her hand all over her body and felt something sticky coming out of her crotch. Jennifer lifted her hand to her face and realized what it was.<br />
<br />
“Double oh no… This can’t be good at all. If this stuff is coming out of me like this and it produces that kind of a strong scent. I&#39;m sure that I won’t survive today&#39;s school day. I need to call Kyle and tell him… that... I... Call Kyle…? Oh my… If only I was able to see him and his big… NO! Jennifer, no!” Jennifer gasped as she was sure that any type of sexual encounter would toast her brain and melt her mind like a butter.<br />
<br />
Jennifer lowered her hand back on her crotch and felt how warm her raccoon pussy felt. Jennifer had to control her urges and abstain herself from masturbating. She wanted to flick her red raccoon bean and give it a swirl but she couldn’t. Jennifer was denying herself which made the awkward situation even more embarrassing for her. If only she didn’t have the curse. Jennifer’s arms were trembling, she was breathing rapidly and her head warming up as her teenager brain tried to process what was happening with her body. Jennifer could only assume that she had to have grown older by one year. <br />
<br />
“Maybe it&#39;s normal for an eighteen year old teenager, like the one named Jennifer, to masturbate all by herself in the bed, right? There’s nothing wrong if I… No... I can’t…” Jennifer huffed.<br />
<br />
Jennifer clenched her teeth and she felt how her eyes were getting watery from the constant denying. She had to ease her horny cravings and without thinking, she had begun to rub her vagina lips with her middle and ring finger. Jennifer felt more relaxed and less anxious as she let her hand do it’s thing.<br />
<br />
“Jeez... I think it’s okay if I do it for a while… while… while I close my eyes… and think about Kyle… and his… ahhh…. Kyle’s rabbit to-mmhhmm...” Jennifer said to herself as she continued rubbing her vagina and took a solid grip from her breast with her other hand.<br />
<br />
Jennifer breathed heavily as she imagined herself getting licked by Kyle’s rabbit tongue. Jennifer let her mind to think how satisfying it must have felt to have Kyle to bang her pussy and let her be her submissive bitch rabbit who did everything she asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Kyle. Lick it. Just right that. Please Kyle. Don’t stop. Keep licking it. Use your tongue on that red spot. Please Kyle. My short and sweet bunny-rabbit.” Jennifer murmured on her bed as she inserted her fingers inside her pussy lips and begun to rub her hole while pressing her red bean with her thumb.<br />
<br />
Jennifer pinched her nipple with her other arm’s thumb and pointer finger to send sparks inside her head as she was really getting into the mood. The rubbing and gentle twisting was turning made Jennifer forget the passage of the time until she remembered what she was doing. It was an abrupt end without an orgasm made Jennifer’s body in a state of shock. Jennifer knew that she couldn’t continue further as she had promised for Kyle to him and her back to humans.<br />
<br />
Jennifer forced herself out of the bed and tried to search for clothes which she couldn’t find anywhere. First it was her panties and now rest of her clothes. A thought popped in Jennifer mind that she didn’t want to accept. She would had to go downstairs and tip-toe to her mother’s room to confirm her sneaking suspicion. Maybe Jennifer’s clothes were all dirty and they needed a quick wash. Jennifer opened her room’s door and heard her mother’s loud snoring coming from the master bedroom. There was a small chance that she could mess her situation even worse. What if it was only her who had no clothes and others still wore their normal shirts and skirts. For Jennifer one wrong decision would mean that she was going to wake up year younger the next morning. She wasn&#39;t sure anymore if she wanted to become younger as she was so close from graduating and ending the curse.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the clock on the wall and saw that bus could be at their front yard at any minute. She didn’t have much time to think. Jennifer had to make a decision and improvise the rest.</p>
