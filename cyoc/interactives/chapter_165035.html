<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon got a funny feeling go through him as soon as the genie said, &quot;Alakazam!&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t exactly place what this feeling was, but he could tell something wasn&#39;t right. He was anxious to see if the genie had actually changed anything, but this wasn&#39;t that. He was physically uncomfortable somehow. It felt like things were hanging off of him that weren&#39;t natural--things he didn&#39;t need and didn&#39;t really want. Oh yeah! His clothes. Maybe he should get rid of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... genie? This is a really awkward question, but... is it wrong if you see me naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you ask? Do you want me to be your girlfriend instead of Monica?&quot; she giggled, knowing the answer already. Damon blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s hard to explain. I just got this weird feeling that I don&#39;t belong in all these clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie giggled again. &quot;Damon, you&#39;re obviously going to need to be okay with taking your clothes off if you want Monica to love you.&quot; So he did it. He took them all off, folded them up, and laid them on the table. This made him feel so much better! He was free in the open air, and he realized him felt so much more energetic than usual. He jumped around a few times, feeling as though he could run in circles, jump on the furniture, walk for miles, and do it all again after a short chance to cool off. And he could do it all without his clothes.<br />
<br />
That was the really weird part, he knew. Here he was bouncing around with his dick hanging out in front of the genie, feeling as though this was almost expected. His human sense of modesty had already been ripped out of him, but Damon didn&#39;t understand that he had lost any part of his humanity yet. He was only thinking of Monica. He thought of her soft voice and sweet smell, and the vision of her on the beach. The found himself imagining of her coming up to him, calling his name, bringing him food and gently patting him on his head or on his bare back. Happiness bubbled up inside him, and he felt a little something twitching in the top of his butt crack. Hmmm... what could that be? His imagination moved on to the thought Monica rubbing his tummy, and the wiggle turned into a bendy, swaying feeling behind him.<br />
<br />
Now Damon was really curious, and the bending stopped. He turned around and found a sturdy length of bony flesh sticking out of his butt. It was totally covered in solid white fur, and he noticed that it tapered to a thin point and was thickest where came out of his butt. Was this what he felt moving around back there? The genie giggled. Damon grabbed the thing and held it, trying to figure out where it came from and why it was attached to him. He looked up at the genie and held it off to his side as if to show it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; he asked with his head cocked to one side.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your new tail, of course,&quot; she said matter-of-factly. &quot;So you can wag it whenever it&#39;s time to greet Monica.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of greeting Monica did cause Damon&#39;s tail to try to wag. But he was trying to understand how it would make Monica choose him over Travis. Weren&#39;t animals supposed to have tails? Was this some weird sex thing that even he didn&#39;t know about?<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Damon felt a funny feeling in his penis which he was so casually exposing. It was getting hardier, bonier even, and new fuzzy skin was growing around it and linking it up to his crotch. There were black and white regions of fuzz all over this new skin and on his scrotum. How was he going to make love to Monica without a normal penis? Then again, Damon realized that he didn&#39;t really want to have sex with her anymore. When he imagined spending with Monica, he imagined playing tug-of-war with her or walking on the beach with her or curling up beside her on the floor. He knew he should want to have sex with her... but... he didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t put two and two together until he felt his ears bend all the way down, right near where where they attached to his head. Apparently, they had grown too long and just flopped over. Reaching up, they were flat and veiny triangles with soothingly soft fuzz on top. Even though he couldn&#39;t see them since he didn&#39;t have a mirror, there was no denying what kind of ears these were. Now it all made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna be a dog now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did say that Monica loved them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how will I be her boyfriend? Is she gonna to be a dog, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t give her boyfriend! I&#39;ve been saying that since I came out of the lamp! You&#39;re well aware that she has to choose that on her own. I can easily give her a pet, though, so that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to be. I can change your body even though I cannot change her heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon wasn&#39;t sure what to think of what the genie was saying. He wanted Monica to fall in love with him as a human! Still, if she&#39;s already chosen Thomas, maybe it won&#39;t be so bad to end up this way. Being a pet sounds so much more fun than being a human anyway. *Wait a minute, what am I thinking?! I&#39;m a human not some butt-sniffing animal!* thought Damon. All of this conflicted thinking, combined with the growth of claws on his fingernails, made him let out a doggish whine and look pitifully at the genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you&#39;d give anything to be in her life. Surely your humanity is a rather small price, all things considered?&quot;<br />
<br />
He used his new claws to scratch at his torso which was growing copious short fur. It was white! No, no, it was black! It was both! He had lots of white fur but lots of black spots throughout it. *I&#39;m a ... dalmatian?*<br />
<br />
&quot;The pet she always wanted,&quot; the genie commented, as though reading his mind.<br />
<br />
His shoulders changed, and Damon was could only hold his arms straight out in front of him as his upper arms shortened and his forearms lengthened. His hands lengthened, too, but his thumbs shortened into dewclaws while his fingers became padded toes. He figured he&#39;d be on all fours soon, so he&#39;d better get down before he was forced down. It wasn&#39;t long before his legs shortened and his lengthening feet got paws at the end like his hands.<br />
<br />
Sitting with his forepaws on the ground like a dog, Damon&#39;s final surprise was the change of his face. His tongue flopped out, and it sure was longer than it had been before! His face pushed forward and his nose turned wet. He could smell things now... things he shouldn&#39;t be able to smell. Things that weren&#39;t even in the house! Things that were in the trash (things that made him hungry). He wanted to smell Monica. Everything dissolved around him as the genie teleported them both. When the world came back, he could smell other things, and see them too if he tried. He was somewhere else now. He was at Monica&#39;s house!</p>
