<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting around my dorm room was getting old real fast.  Lately I’d been feeling a mixture of stress and boredom, both broken only by my frequent visits with my girlfriend Penny and my best bud Brandon.  It was my first year in college and the sudden change of workload was really wearing me down, though I always managed to get my work done on time.  But here I was in college, and I knew I was missing something.  Like those big wild college parties you hear about all the time.  Nope, haven’t been to a one.  Sure there are a few of them on campus, but usually only with the frats and I wasn’t in one.<br />
<br />
My name is Adam Quinn and I’m almost 19 years old.  I have dirty brown hair and am an inch short of 6 feet.  Though I’m no hunk, I’m certainly not ugly either.  So far college life has been all right, but I had to admit that it wasn’t quite what I expected.  The best thing that’s happened so far was that I had met Penny in my algebra class and we hit it right off.  She’s about 5 foot 7, has dark blonde hair and a lively personality.<br />
<br />
Looking at my watch, I knew that Penny wouldn’t  be done with her last class for at least another hour and I was bored.  Sure I had a few exams I could study for, but I was kind of burnt out on studying for the moment.  And Brandon wasn’t around at the moment either, leaving me bored and without any worthwhile distractions.  Sighing I figured that maybe I needed some fresh air.  “Maybe the mall?” I mused to myself, taking one final glance at my history book before taking off.<br />
I walked around the mall without having any particular destination in mind, mostly just being there to kill some time.  <br />
<br />
Walking past the book store, I almost went in but figured that I’d had enough books in my classes that I didn’t really need any more at the moment.  Instead I just kept walking, stopping several minutes later when I saw a store that I don’t remember having seen before.<br />
<br />
What caught my attention about the store was that unlike the other stores in the mall, this one actually had a front.  And a real door.  Not something you see every day in a mall.  Since the place had caught my attention I looked it over a little more closely, seeing a sign above the door that read Spells R Us.  Not recognizing the name, I just shrugged, wondering just what they sold.  Probably some sort of D&D type stuff I guessed.  Or maybe some of those Magic the Gathering cards.  I knew a couple guys that played that game though I never had.  Neither of those ideas really appealed to me, but I was curious and the only way to find out for sure was to actually go in.<br />
<br />
A bell above the door tinkled as I went in though I didn’t pay it too much attention.  Instead I glanced around, wondering just what kind of shop this was.  There didn’t seem to be any kind of order to the junk covering all the shelves.  Then an old guy behind the counter, dressed up in some kind of wizards robe asks me, “Can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“No thanks,” I told him, wondering if I should bother to even look around some more.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure Adam?” he asked again, making me suddenly freeze.  How the hell did he know my name?  The old guy chuckled, saying, “Before you ask, I’m a wizard.  It facilities dealing with my customers to know who they are and just what they need.”<br />
<br />
Snorting I said, “Yeah, sure,” and noticed that he looked rather disappointed.  Still, he did know my name and that was an interesting trick.  “How did you really know my name?” I asked.<br />
<br />
He just shook his head and said, “I already told you Adam.  I am a wizard.  And you are here because you need something that I can provide.”<br />
<br />
I don’t really know why, but something about him made me start to take him more seriously.  “And what do I need?” I asked him curiously.<br />
<br />
The old guy smiled and calmly replied, “A few changes in your life would be nice wouldn’t they?” I nodded, not really knowing what changes he meant.  “I have something that you might be interested in,” he said, reaching behind the counter.<br />
<br />
Moments later, he set a small bundle of cloth onto the counter and started to unwrap the cloth.  When he was finished, sitting in the middle of the while rag was a fairly plain looking ring that looked like it was made of gold.  And next to it was some kind of necklace or amulet that also looked sort of like gold, though I suspected that it wasn’t.<br />
<br />
“And what are these?” I asked feeling genuine curiosity.  The ring looked rather plain, but the necklace looked somewhat interesting.  The whole thing seemed to have a snake wrapped all around the outside, as if looping around several times, and with its own tail in its mouth.  Definitely weird.<br />
<br />
Chuckling, the old guy picked up both of them and held them in his hands for a second before setting them back on the counter.  “These,” he said finally, “are very special.  The wearer of the ring is subject to change, while the necklace controls the changes.”  <br />
<br />
When the old guy saw that I didn’t understand, he explained that whoever had the necklace could change the body of whomever wore the ring.  It certainly did sound interesting at least.  He finally added with a faint smile, “Think of what you could do with Penny wearing the ring.”  <br />
<br />
I grinned back thinking about it in anticipation.  If this actually worked, it could certainly be interesting.<br />
<br />
However I still wasn’t sure that it was real and told the salesman so. He just sighed and said, “So many skeptics.” Shaking his head slightly, he told me “ If it isn’t really magic, you can bring it back here for a full refund.  Deal?”<br />
<br />
“All right,” I agreed, eyeing the ring and necklace skeptically.  “But how much do they cost?”<br />
<br />
“Ah,” he said grinning broadly, “the subject of money.  Together they come to sixty dollars.”  <br />
<br />
I groaned loudly knowing that this was going to drain me.  Fortunately he promised me that I’d get my money back if it didn’t work.  If they didn’t though, I knew I was going to feel real stupid anyway.  After handing over the money, the old guy gave me the ring and necklace, wrapped up again in the cloth and stuffed into a plastic bag.  <br />
<br />
“I hope you enjoy your purchase Adam,” he told me.  <br />
<br />
Thanking him, I turned and left, eager to get home and show what I got to Penny.<br />
<br />
Later that night in Penny’s apartment (her parents didn’t want her living in the dorms), I told her what had happened to me at the mall.  She laughed, saying, “Common.  Magic?  You can’t be serious.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” I told her with a grin, “you never know until you try it.”  I held out the ring adding, “Wanna try it on?”<br />
<br />
She chuckled saying, “You first.”<br />
<br />
I shrugged and grinned back at her, sliding the ring on my own finger.  A strange tingling sensation ran through me for a second, catching me by surprise.  <br />
<br />
“Whoa,” I said, staring at the ring in amazement.  Maybe this was real after all.  “Here goes nothing,” I said holding the necklace in my hand, thinking about the changes I wanted to make.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately I felt the changes starting to happen, and I looked at Penny grinning as she gasped in surprise.  “What do you think?” I asked, flexing my now larger muscles.<br />
<br />
“My God,” she muttered, staring at me in awe.  “I can’t believe it.  It worked.”<br />
<br />
“Told you so,” I teased her, not admitting that I’d had serious doubts but it myself until just then.  But with me now looking almost like a body builder, I certainly couldn’t deny that it was real.  I only wished that my clothes had grown too.  They were definitely too tight.  So with a quick use of the necklace, I was back to normal, with my clothes once again fitting me comfortably.<br />
<br />
“Let me try it,” Penny pleaded.<br />
<br />
Still grinning, I handed Penny the necklace and started to pull the ring from my finger.  Gasping, I struggled with it, finding that it wouldn’t budge.  It had slid onto my finger with absolutely no problem, but now it was refusing to come off.  <br />
<br />
“Damn,” I swore, getting rather frustrated with it, and perhaps a little nervous.<br />
<br />
Penny chuckled, holding the necklace tightly with a look of concentration on her face.  I didn’t like that at all.  Suddenly I could feel myself changing again and gasped in surprise.  Quickly I pulled down my pants and found that my cock had grown bigger.  <br />
<br />
“Looking good,” Penny said smirking, walking over to me and touching it.  Almost immediately I started to get hard.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” I said in awe, staring at my fully erect member.  It looked to be about 10 inches.<br />
<br />
Winking at me, Penny backed up and set the necklace down on a small table, then said, “Common big boy, let’s try that thing out.”  <br />
<br />
Without needing any further invitation, I quickly followed Penny into her bedroom.</p>
