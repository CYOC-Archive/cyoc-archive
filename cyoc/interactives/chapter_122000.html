<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle got to thinking about everything. She really wore out About fighting with Jennifer.  They fought the way to school. Trying to put hope in her. But.... Maybe She is right. But She feels bad that Jennifer is now just her pussy. Michelle thinks of a plan. As she got dress. She didn&#39;t put panties on as she was putting her pants on.   <br />
Jennifer notice that there was no panties in the pants with her. That is werid Jennifer thought but she just sighs giving up hope. Michelle is always known to not make it to class on time. So what she got planned Class wouldn&#39;t get in her way. She looks for Kyle as she walks into the hallway of the school. She see him at his locker. She gonna have to get him under her spell which wont be hard. Because Kyle had a huge crush on Michelle. So it&#39;s time for Michelle to use her Whore-ish ways. She walk up behind Kyle. She rest her head on his shoulder. <br />
&quot;Hello there&quot; She whisper in his ear. Kyle jump for a second as he turn around to face her. &quot;Oh Hey Michelle! How is Jennifer?&quot; He said as he put his hands up in his face. He opens his hands in the peeka- boo matter but he makes a fish face mocking Jennifer. &quot;Hehe That&#39;s cute Kyle, you been working on that in the mirror?&quot; Michelle said as she giggle. &quot;Yeah I have. Thank you.&quot; Kyle said as he chuckles. Michelle leans up into Kyle&#39;s face. She breathe into his glasses making them foggy as she said &quot; You know Kyle, You looking cute today. I&#39;m feeling horny do you want to help me with this wet problem I have between my legs?&quot; Kyle blush as he takes off his glasses to clear the fog off them. &quot;Umm.. Yes, I would love to help you.&quot; He said putting his glasses back on. &quot;Good boy. Meet you in the girl&#39;s bathroom.&quot; Michelle said as lick his cheek. She walk pass him heading to the bathroom. Kyle stood there a minute shock as a girl like that wanted him. He feels himself starting to get hard.<br />
Michelle walk into the bathroom as she think to herself &quot;Virgins, they are so easy.&quot; &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jennifer said to Michelle. &quot; Oh you don&#39;t worry about a thing. You just keep being cute and wet for me. I got everything under control.&quot; Michelle said as she reach down into her pants. She rubs Jennifer&#39;s lips as she thinks about her crush Jeff thrusting into her again to make Jennifer get wet. Jennifer started getting hot as she thinks about Jeff&#39;s cock again. She gets lost in her thoughts as she getting wet. Michelle smirks, sliding her finger into Jennifer&#39;s mouth as she started thrusting her finger up into Jennifer. Jennifer gets more wetter as some pussy juice leak out of her lips. Jennifer is lost in all the pleasure as she moans against Michelle&#39;s finger. Kyle enter into the Girl&#39;s bathroom and the first thing he see is Michelle pleasing herself. He stops and watches. He think about the time at his house as he see Michelle is enjoying herself this time. <br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t just stand there. Get undress Big boy.&quot; Michelle said as she winks at him. Kyle nods as he fight with his shirt. He pulls it off as his glasses hit the ground. He goes to pick them up. He looks over as Michelle. She is already turn around showing him her ass. She unzips her pants as she pulls them down, bending over showing him all her goodies. Kyle puts on his glasses and he blush as he takes off his pants. He than takes off his boxers. Michelle looks over her shoulder at him and give Jennifer some more finger thrusting. Kyle blush more as he feels his heart pretty much in his ears pounding away. He got a boner right away watching Michelle. Michelle stands up right as she walks over to Kyle. She thrust her finger into his mouth, the one she was using for Jennifer. &quot;She taste good don&#39;t she?&quot; Michelle said looking at him. Kyle close his eyes as he suck Michelle&#39;s finger. He nods as she pulls her finger out. &quot; You want some more?&quot; Michelle said smirking. Kyle nod his head. &quot;Get on the floor.&quot; Michelle said pointing down. <br />
Kyle gets on the floor on his shirt and pants. Michelle smirks as she sits on his face. &quot;Go ahead and lick away. She is numb right now.&quot; Michelle said. &quot;The spirit really mess her up huh?&quot; Kyle said as he takes off his glasses. He lean his head up and licks Jennifer&#39;s lips. Jennifer is still lost in her thoughts but she feels that she getting licked by someone. It makes her get more lost in her thoughts as she moans more. &quot; Yeah the old lady did... Come on Kyle, I didn&#39;t ask a puppy dog to the job. Get up in there!&quot; Michelle shout at him so she can block out the sound of the bell ringing. Kyle close his eyes as he slide his tongue into Jennifer. Michelle moans as she bites his lip and grind against Kyle&#39;s face. &quot;That&#39;s a good boy.&quot; She moans. Kyle wiggles his tongue around in Jennifer. Jennifer moans as she is still lost in her thoughts but she knows there is something pleasing her inside walls of her mouth. &quot;Hey Kyle, Transform or Dare?&quot; She whispers. Kyle didn&#39;t hear her as he is still licking the insides of Jennifer loving the taste. <br />
Michelle smirks as she said &quot;Woops Time is up.&quot; She gets off of Kyle. &quot;Wait what?&quot; Kyle said as he looks at her with a confuse look on his face. &quot;Wait... Did you just?...&quot; Kyle said as he gets up and glare at her. &quot; I did. And your time is up. Sooo... I been thinking about how lonely poor Jennifer is down there. She needs a friend.&quot; Michelle said. &quot;What?! Noo!&quot; Kyle said with widen eyes. &quot;Yes now, Your Transform is that you will be my panties for a month. So you can feel what it&#39;s like to be in Jennifer&#39;s shoes! Your Dare is I dare you to kiss Jennifer for the spell to kick in.&quot; Michelle said as she makes a kissy face. She put her leg up on the sink so he can have a good view of Jennifer. Kyle felt himself wanting to kiss Jennifer. He can&#39;t stop looking at her. Before he knew it he was at her bent over. He kisses her gently and Michelle smirks. Than Kyle felt a tingling feeling in his body as smoke come outs of his body. Then he poofs as he turns into hot pink panties. &quot; Well aint you cute!&quot; Michelle said as she picks him up. Kyle blush as he was scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m late for class. So enjoy your day with Jennifer. By the way, She enjoy chewing on my panties.&quot; Michelle said smirking as she puts him down at her kneels. She steps in the holes and slides him up onto her. She put her pants on, hide his clothes in the trash can,  Put his glasses on her head, and walk her way to her class.</p>
