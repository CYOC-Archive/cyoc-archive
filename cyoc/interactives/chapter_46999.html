<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
My heart sank in my chest.  I looked at the clock in the room.  It was 4 o’clock.  I just remembered that I had invited over my girlfriend Sara and her friends Christine and Allison to watch a movie.  This…could get interesting.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my god, look at us!” said Mrs. Flemington frantically.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Mom, gotta work fast,” I explained.  Before she could question what I meant, I wished that we were all fully dressed again and that no one would question why it happened so suddenly.  In an instant all ten of us were clothed again.<br />
<br />
“Joe,” my mother said, “what’s going on?”  She looked a little confused.<br />
<br />
“I forgot to tell you that I invited Sara and two of her friends over,” I said.  <br />
<br />
“Oh,” she said.  She looked at the rest of the women who appeared a little confused as well.  “Maybe you should send them away.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t do that,” I said.  “That would be too weird.”<br />
<br />
“Who’s Sara?” Mrs. Gabrielli asked.<br />
<br />
“My girlfriend,” I said quickly as I walked to the door.  <br />
<br />
“Oh,” Mrs. Gabrielli said.  Her voice sounded disappointed.<br />
<br />
I turned back to the group.  “Just act like you’re having a normal meeting,” I said.  My mother took her seat again and encouraged the woman to start chatting.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang again.  Once I was satisfied that they were engaged in a normal meeting, or at least gave the appearance of it, I opened the door.<br />
<br />
I was greeted with a snooty voice that said “What took you so long?”<br />
<br />
“Nice to see you too, Allison,” I answered.  “Come in.”  I opened the door and the three girls walked in.  They were all 17, just like me.  They were also three of the prettier girls in school, which was enhanced by the fact that they were all cheerleaders.  The pretty ones always were, right?<br />
<br />
Sara was the leader of this little group.  We had been together for a few months.  It had not yet become too serious.  We made out a few times but nothing further.  She was about 5’6” and had blonde hair that extended just beyond her shoulder blades.  Christine had shorter brown hair that only went as far as her the top of her shoulders.  Allison had very long, wavy black hair.  Christine and Allison were a bit stuck up, but Christine still had a generally pleasant demeanor.  Allison, on the other hand, did not.  She was a typical snob who would find life after high school very difficult since she was not rich.  Christine and Allison were a bit of an odd pair.  Any guy at the high school would love to have them.  But they were either highly selective or not into guys, because they never seemed to have boyfriends.  The possibility of whether or not they were dating each other was a juicy rumor.  It was only that, however, since there was no evidence supporting it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, are we interrupting something?” Sara asked as her eyes scanned the room.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no,” my mother said as she stood up and walked over to say “hello.”  “We’re just having our meeting.  Joe forgot to tell me you were coming over today, dear.”  Sara and my mother had met a few times.  They seemed to like each other.  My mother had never met Christine and Allison.  “Hi, I’m Joe’s mother,” she greeted them.  They introduced themselves as well.<br />
<br />
“It’s ok, we’re just going to watch in the spare room upstairs,” I said.  Fortunately we did have a spare room that did have a television and DVD player.  It would have been awkward to try and wish for one so quickly.  I did wish that the room was clean and that there was a couch in the room that could seat four people easily without being too big for the room.  I also quickly wished that my mother knew I made that wish and that she was OK with it.<br />
<br />
I hurried the girls upstairs as quick as I could.  There was no need to linger.  We went upstairs and found the room in the condition I wished it to be.  “So what are we going to watch?” asked Allison.  <br />
<br />
“Whatever you want,” I said.  I had a storage rack with about 100 DVD’s.  Allison looked at them.  “You like some weird movies, Joe,” she said dismissively.  I wished that there would be something she’d pick so as not to drag this out.  “Ooh, Halloween,” she said as she took the original version of the horror movie out of the rack.  “I’ve never seen all of this.”  She handed it to me and I dutifully put it into the DVD player.  <br />
<br />
We sat down on the couch and started to watch the movie.  About 20 minutes into the running time I began to feel bored.  It was at this time that I noticed something a bit strange about our positions on the couch.  I was on end and Sara was next to me.  We were close to each other, but our bodies did not touch each other.  There was a definite gap in between Sara and the other girls, however.  Christine and Allison could not have been closer to each other.  Christine was on the other end of the couch and Allison practically sat in her lap.  Allison’s head also leaned against Christine’s shoulder.  This was something I did not expect.  Whatever my suspicions were, I did not expect them to act like this.<br />
<br />
I just had to know.  I wished to know whether or not Christine and Allison were lesbians.  Sara leaned over to me and whispered, “You know they’re with each other, right?”  I was surprised by how my wish was granted, but decided to play along again.  I nodded as I resisted the urge to look at them.  Sara whispered again, “They think you know and that I made you promise not to tell, so don’t let on that I lied.”  I nodded again.  Sara returned to her original position.  I glanced very briefly at the other two.  They did not notice.  Well, good for them, I thought.  If that’s what they wanted and knew it, then maybe they were a bit more mature than I would have guessed.  <br />
<br />
A few more minutes passed.  My thoughts concentrated on the information I learned.  I felt there had to be something I could do with this knowledge.  Then I had an idea.  I stood up and asked the girls, “You gals want anything to drink?”  Allison and Christine asked for water and Sara said she was fine.  “Be back in a couple minutes,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Do you want us to pause the movie?” Christine asked.<br />
<br />
“Nah, that’s ok,” I said.  “Be right back.”<br />
<br />
On my way out of the room I closed the door so that it was only slightly ajar.  I rushed down the stairs back to the living room.  The meeting was still in progress.  The ladies realized that I returned.  Once I knew they were looking at me I said, “I have a question for all of you.”</p>
