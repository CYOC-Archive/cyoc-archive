<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle watched her body excitedly as she felt the tingling of the magic pass through her. She couldn&#39;t wait to find out just what parts of her were so horribly flawed that they were keeping her away from the man of her dreams - and see them disappear in favor of total perfection. She glanced back at Nick&#39;s confused face long enough to notice that he seemed to be getting slightly shorter. Was that it? She needed to be a few inches taller than him to be his ideal woman? Michelle shrugged, not caring that much about the minor height difference...<br />
<br />
Before she could wonder any further, her clothes vanished into thin air, and she found herself completely exposed to the man of her dreams.  She saw his mouth drop open in surprise and shock, then she was distracted by the sudden, intense burning sensation that inflamed every part of her body. It was like her skin was covered in fire ants that were crawling and poking all over. Then she saw something growing out slightly in her crotch – her vagina filled in and extended slightly into the tiny beginnings of a penis and balls. Oh my God, she thought to herself – he’s gay!  It all made sense now, she hadn’t even considered Nick was into other guys!<br />
<br />
Sure enough, her penis and balls were only the size of a newborn’s, but she was sure that would quickly change.  Her body was developing a decidedly masculine appearance, strong lean muscles that reminded her of the kind of guys she saw at the beach.  She noticed her hair curling down into her eyes, shaggy and sun-kissed.  She was going to be a surfer, it was happening so quickly she didn’t even know how to feel about this, she felt her body getting harder and stronger, estrogen replaced with testosterone, her feminine body going from hourglass to v-shaped muscled torso, atop strong, lean muscled legs.  She cried out in surprise with a new deeper and definitely masculine voice as her Adam’s apple grew out like a man’s.<br />
<br />
Then she became confused as she saw her pecs weren’t reshaping into the typical male pecs, but instead expanding into two double-D breasts jutting out proud and large.  “Oh my God” she said in a soft dude voice, even as her mind felt like it was suddenly filled by a thousand bees. She grabbed her head in her hands, crying out in pain, unaware of the shaggy armpit hair filling in as her surfer hair spilled onto her shoulders, and hair prickled out of her arms, legs, across her chest, and a treasure trail down her cobblestone abs.  Five-o-clock shadow spread across her more masculine, cute face, her eyes pressed shut in pain.  Then a moment later, the pain cleared, and she opened her eyes, head completely cleared of thought, her eyes striking blue and devoid of any thought.<br />
<br />
She opened her mouth and spoke, her voice the soft surfer voice from a thousand dude movies.  “Ho fuck, what happened?”  She looked down at her crotch and realized her proper pronoun was “he” now.  He held his cock and balls in one hand.  They were so tiny, they hadn’t grown any bigger after all, the size of a newborn’s.  But they still felt good when he touched them, and realized they felt super good like he could cum if he tugged just once.  So he did, and he moaned as he had his first male orgasm – it was more intense than anything he had experienced in his life, a tiny dewdrop of cum appeared on  the tip of his tiny baby cock.<br />
<br />
Then he looked at his new breasts.  They were huge, and he immediately started bouncing them up and down playfully, laughing.  “Ha ha, I got big boobs!”<br />
<br />
He was quite a sight, the epitome of a healthy young beach dude with slim muscular body that guys would die to have, bouncing a couple of double-D boobs that those same men would die to play with (minus the hair, of course), up and down on his own chest.<br />
<br />
She hadn’t turned into the ideal woman at all – she had turned into a dumb, tiny cocked, big breasted she-male surfer!<br />
<br />
How could this have happened? He had been staring at Nick through most of the transformation – so he indeed must be gay – it was the only explanation.  Yet it seemed he had a thing for dumb she-males with big racks and genitals that were barely there.  Michelle remembered what the bearded old shopkeeper had said to her, that any changes would be permanent. PERMANENT...  The remains of the small glass vial laid, crushed, on the pavement near one of his newly-formed big manly feet. He looked at his boobs, mesmerized, and started playing with them as Nick watched awestruck and completely at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Nick watched it all happen in disbelief. Michelle, he had thought to himself, was a rather good-looking woman - it was too bad he could never force himself to have any attraction to her, but one can’t help who or what one is attracted to. Then came something he would never have even thought to wish for. Watching her transform into part one of his fantasy right before his very eyes - that was now the hottest thing he&#39;d ever seen in his life, real or fictional. And it wasn&#39;t lost on him that she looked just like the hot she-male surfer victim in all of those private comics he drew growing up – the ones he destroyed after drawing them for years because he was so scared that someone would find them and his perversion would be discovered by his siblings or parents.<br />
<br />
He knew that his private fantasies could only ever remain that, because such transformations were impossible.  People simply couldn’t transform the way he drew them transforming in his comics.  Nevertheless, that was his deepest secret fantasy.  He shook himself out of those thoughts quickly. They were giving him a powerful erection, and he was still in a public place. Plus, more importantly, something fantastically impossible had just happened right in front of him, and he needed to know what was going on. And, he couldn’t help but wonder, does that mean the rest of his secret fantasy would come true as well?<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Michelle? Is that you?&quot; he asked the she-male surfer standing next to him playing with his own large boobs, tiny cock and balls forgotten and looking as comically out of place on the hot surfer body as the large DD honkers he was currently juggling up and down.<br />
<br />
“Boobs,” Michael smiled dreamily, still bouncing them up and down, as if he was a kid who just discovered the best toy in the world.<br />
<br />
Nick put his hand on one of Michael’s arms to get his attention. &quot;How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
“I think my name is Michael,” the fit she-male said, looking up at Nick for the first time.  &quot;Holy fuck… you’re tho handthome,&quot; Michael lisped, suddenly feeling self-conscious and very gay.  He looked with wide eyes at Nick, clearly smitten to the core.<br />
<br />
“Michael,” Nick echoed, quickly taking him by the arm and retreated with him to Nick’s car before they were noticed. He was incredulous.  “What happened?” he asked with such disbelief that it cut through Michael’s love-sick haze.<br />
<br />
“Oh dude,” Michael followed Nick obediently,  “I like got this little potion at this shop I found that turned out to be magic.”<br />
<br />
A magic shop? Definitely not the run-of-the-mill kind for magicians! Judging by what he just witnessed, Nick wished he&#39;d been the one to discover something like that. All the impossible fantasies of his that could finally be fulfilled if he got his hands on potions like these - hopefully more deliberately than this. He would definitely have to ask where to find that shop, once whatever this was got straightened out. He opened his passenger side door for Michael, ushering him in as someone came into view. &quot;What was the potion supposed to do?”<br />
<br />
&quot;It was... dude...&quot; Michael hesitated. &quot;This is totally embarrassing... The dude at the shop said it was a &#39;Dream Partner Potion&#39;! You drink it while making eye contact with somebody, it turns you into the ideal partner for that person. I guess I, uh, should have just told you, but I had the biggest crush on you for like forever dude, and I thought it would get you to finally notice me. But I didn’t expect all this radicalness, dude - get totally turned into... this!&quot; he grabbed his boobs in the front seat for emphasis, and started bouncing them up and down laughing, his teeny weeny fully erect at a quarter of an inch – if that!<br />
<br />
Nick closed the door after Michael, and quickly got in the driver’s side, his face, already pale from the shock, went a ghostly white. He knew he was fucked up, but he&#39;d never thought about it so bluntly before – if only his ideal sexual partner was just a she-male, then he could have been with someone years ago. But if what he suspected was coming next, he had to get home quickly.  He didn’t know if it would unfold like in the comics he drew, of if the change would just magically continue to the next state – but regardless he didn’t want the attention it would draw if it happened publicly.  He didn’t care to make national headlines. To think that this magic had found him out and exposed his darkest secret, when he wouldn&#39;t have even admitted to himself that he was that perverted...<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprise, I like she-males,&quot; Nick stammered, trying to act casual, and wishing that was the extent of it. &quot;So I guess that’s a bit of a shock for you.” Nick drove the speed limit, only a couple minutes from home.  “Say, that guy didn&#39;t happen to, uh, give you any pointers on how to undo the magic from that thing, did he?&quot; He had to force himself to blink, his eyes were so wide, as he stared at the incredibly, distractingly beautiful she-male next to him… and the anticipation of what was coming next had him raging hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;He told me the potion was permanent,&quot; Michael answered. &quot;But dude, I don’t mind… this is so much fun and you’re so hot! Besides, the shop disappeared when I left.”<br />
<br />
Nick felt Michael’s hand rubbing his hard-on through his skinny jeans, and the next thing he knew Michael’s head was in his lap, mouth enveloping his bulge through the fabric.  “Oh fuck no!” Nick cried out as he pulled into his driveway, feeling so very exposed in this suburban neighborhood, no trees, bushes or fences to hide anything.<br />
<br />
Nick was so hard now he could barely think. “We have to get inside,” He told Michael, trying to pull the hot she-male of his fantasies off his crotch half-heartedly, as the engine quieted and he fumbled with his keys.  He opened his car door, his erection strained against the damp material of his jeans and Michael’s hot, wet mouth; he knew the reality that was coming any second now would be so much worse than the fantasy. As much as he wanted to play with those potions himself, maybe it was for the best if they never found that magic shop. He got out of the car, Michael stumbling out after him onto the ground, in all of his naked she-male glory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick!” Michael cried desperately.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asked, surprised and scared of what might already be happening, eyes darting around the neighborhood in panic hoping there were no onlookers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you inside me – oh God I need it so bad – I never needed anything so bad before in my life!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Nick relented, “But can we just get inside first?”<br />
<br />
Michael made a noise that made Nick realize it was already too late.  Nick panicked and practically came all at once, trying not to lose his mind as he was about to live out his own life-long deepest, darkest fantasy right in his own front yard where the whole neighborhood could watch.</p>
