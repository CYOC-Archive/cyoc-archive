<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy tried to quietly sneak out of the barn.  Maybe if she could make it to the store, she could make another wish and fix all this mess. Mandy spotted her and directed John to trap her under his large front claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t kill me, &quot; begged Amy.<br />
<br />
Mandy cackled, a truly evil laugh.  &quot;Now why would I do that?  It is so much more fun to see you suffer, watching me enjoy the pet dragon you so desperately wanted.  But I do have a few questions.  And if you don&#39;t give me some answers, I will hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy gulped and shivered a little.  &quot;Okay, okay.  What do you want to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, what is this thing&#39;s name?  I feel kind of silly calling it Dragon, &quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
It seemed liked a harmless question to Amy.  Maybe she could get out of this in one piece.  &quot;Jana, her name is Jana,&quot; said Amy quickly.<br />
<br />
Mandy looked confused.  &quot;I could have sworn I saw its penis when it was coming over here.  Oh, well.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me.  Male or female it&#39;s a dragon and its mine.  Now tell me how you got it.  And tell the truth, or I will hurt you.  I know the magic store had something to do with it because I saw both of you coming out of there.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a little gentle persuasion, Amy spilled the beans and told Mandy everything.  Mandy scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have had anything, and you wished for this? A pet dragon?  You are really pathetic!  C&#39;mon girls.  That&#39;s all I need to know, &quot; said Mandy. She directed Jana out of the barn.  Mandy was pleased to see that Jana would follow her commands even if she just thought them. The leash must have created some kind of telepathic link between them.<br />
Mandy happily marched out of the barn, heading towards the magic shop. Her friends followed closely behind as she walked through the forest.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Mandy, can we ride up there with you, &quot; said one of the girls as they walked through the forest with Mandy while she rode Jana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, if you are brave enough, &quot; said Mandy.  Jana lowered her head, breathing heavily in front of the frightened girl.  She took one look at the large cold reptilian eyes and sharp fangs and changed her mind.  &quot;Um, I think I&#39;d rather walk.  In fact, I think I hear my mother calling.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took off running away in a different direction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me, too, &quot; said the other girl.  &quot;It&#39;s getting late, and I think I better get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t you want to make a wish? &quot; asked Mandy.<br />
<br />
The girl shook her head.  &quot;Uh, uh. This is just too weird for me.  See you at school tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy just rolled her eyes, and directed Jana to keep walking.  The other girl quickly disappeared behind them.  <br />
What fools!  She didn&#39;t need those girls anyway. Not now that she had Jana.  She patted the dragon gently on its neck.  Those simple girls were just a hindrance to slow her down.  They didn&#39;t deserve a wish.  They would probably have wished for something stupid anyway.  Just like that dork Amy.  But Mandy had other ideas.  More ambitious ideas.  And soon a simple wish would make all her dreams come true.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
After a short flight, Mandy landed in front of the store.  People fled in terror at the sight of the dragon, but Mandy acted nonplussed and  entered the store like the Queen she believed she would soon become.  The store owner, an old man with a long white beard,  looked unperturbed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you miss?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am looking for your wish machine, &quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
The old man rubbed his beard in thought.  &quot;I don&#39;t know if you want to mess with that.  It&#39;s powerful magic.  And wishes never seem to work out the way you had planned.  Best to leave it alone, and try something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.  I know what I&#39;m doing.  I&#39;ll just find it myself, &quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
The old man just shrugged his shoulders and continued to work on his inventory.<br />
<br />
Mandy found the machine in a corner.  It was exactly as Amy had described it.  She placed a quarter in the machine and cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem.  Machine, I wish to be the most powerful person on the planet,&quot; said Mandy.<br />
<br />
The screen flashed, and gave her an error message.<br />
<br />
&quot;WARNING: VAGUE WISH. CLARIFY OR IT WILL GO TO THE WISH INTERPRETER.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mandy scoffed.  Her wish was simple.  What was so difficult for the machine to understand?<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen carefully, you stupid bag of bolts.  I wish to be a big important person. I want to be a powerful Queen, a ruler to be feared and admired by all those little people who are beneath me. &quot;<br />
<br />
The message flashed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;WARNING: VAGUE WISH. CLARIFY OR IT WILL GO TO THE WISH INTERPRETER.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mandy groaned in frustration and shook the machine violently.  &quot;Listen.  I paid my money, now give me my wish or I will rip you apart.  I wish to be big and powerful.  I can&#39;t make it any simpler than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy looked at her dragon resting outside.  She imagined herself as a powerful Queen, controlling an army of dragons. Kind of like that blonde girl from Game of Thrones.  &quot;Make me powerful enough to control a whole legion of dragons like that.  Oh, and make me prettier and more magnificent, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The machine whirred loudly.  Suddenly, it spat out a message.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wish granted! Would you like another wish? Please insert a coin!&quot;<br />
<br />
No that&#39;s more like it, thought Mandy.  See, you just have to be tough and flex a little muscle to get what you want.  She didn&#39;t mind doing that as the future ruler of the world.  In fact, the thought kind of appealed to her.  It would be fun to push all  the little people around. Just like she did at school, but better. There would be no adults that could punish her or stop her. <br />
<br />
Her excitement was stunted by the strange feelings coming from her body.  Her entire body tingled, and her clothes suddenly felt very tight.  She looked down at her hands and saw dark black scales spreading down  her hands and up her arms.  She clenched her hands as they changed into thick claws.  Her legs suddenly swelled tearing through her jeans. She saw that they were covered in dark black scales with small spikes protruding randomly from her body.   Her belly swelled, ripping apart her shirt.  <br />
<br />
Something was wrong.  The machine had tricked her somehow. This isn&#39;t what she wished for.  She stomped over to the store manager.  A large tail erupted from her spine, growing larger and thick as she dragged it down the aisle.  Sharp spines grew from her tail up her back, ripping off what little remained of her shirt.  She stretched her neck as it grew longer.  She hunched as her back as it cracked and extended longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what gives?  Your machine didn&#39;t give me my wish, &quot; said Mandy in a deep gravely baritone.<br />
<br />
The old man looked her up and down.  &quot;Why my dear it gave you exactly what you asked for.  You are becoming quite big and very powerful.  Strong enough to lead an army of dragons.  And you are becoming much prettier and more magnificent than the little one outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy roared in frustration.  The old man was teasing her.  Tricking her, just like that stupid machine.  She slammed her hands down in frustration, denting his counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  Take it back, and give me what I really want or I will tear this place apart.  Starting with you!&quot; growled Mandy.<br />
<br />
The old man glared at her.  He did not look scared, just a little annoyed.  &quot;Young lady, we do not take threats lightly in this store.  You are no longer welcome here.  I don&#39;t think you will fit here much longer anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man snapped his fingers, and Mandy disappeared.  Suddenly, a young girl in brown pigtails ran into the store.  She was out of breath, and could barely speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister, please.  You have to help me.  I&#39;ve made a terrible mistake, and I&#39;m afraid someone is going to get hurt.  Can you help please?&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
The old man lowered his glasses and looked at the young girl.  &quot;I can certainly try, but I can&#39;t make any promises.  Now, what seems to be the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mandy appeared in a large field outside of town.  She raged as her body continued to grow and become more monstrous.  <br />
They had tricked her.  All of them!  The old man, Amy, her stupid dragon Jana, even her own so called friends.  If they had just stuck around she wouldn&#39;t have been in this mess.  As she doubled in height, dwarfing even Jana, she began to tear apart the trees below her.  She spat flames at the surrounding trees, instantly incinerating them.  Her blood boiled and demanded vengeance.  They would all pay, starting with that old man and his shop.  <br />
<br />
As she finished her transformation she remembered she still had one ace up her sleeve.  Her pet, Jana.  She still should be loyal to her.  Together, they would create a path of destruction no one in town would ever forget.  Hell, they would make the whole world tremble in fear.  She mentally called out to her pet, willing her to join Mandy at her side.<br />
<br />
This is going to be so much fun, thought Mandy, as she smiled wickedly.</p>
