<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They then heard a cheery tune as a white truck with brightly colored ice cream designs drove by near the playground. A bunch of people who were playing before then toddled towards the ice cream truck. Jeff then toddled towards the truck as he was excited. “Jeff, wait up.” Tiffany said as they followed him. They waited in line for about several minutes, until it was their turn to get the ice cream from the vendor. “So what could I get you today?” asked the regressed vendor who was wearing a shirt and a diaper. <br />
<br />
“I’ll have a chocolate and vanilla swirl.” Said Jeff. “I’ll have strawberry with a cherry on top.” Said Tiffany. “I’ll have one of those cherry fudge popsicles.” Said Dustin. Within a few moments, they got their ice cream on cups while Dustin got a wrapped popsicle. “I’ll pay for them.” Tiffany said as she brings out her phone and uses an app that acts as a digital paying service, where the vendor scans her phone and it says “Transaction completed”. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Jeff said kindly as they walked away with their ice cream. They later sat at a nearby bench where they happily eat their ice cream, all while making their shirts a bit messy. “So what should we do next?” asked Dustin. “Let’s play some hide and seek.” Tiffany suggested. “You both will hide and I’ll try to find you.” “So where are we going to hide?” asked Jeff. “Near the woods.” She pointed at the nearby area where it had a ton of trees.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Jeff said as both him and Dustin ran to the nearby trees as Tiffany started counting. As they went there, they hid near the bushes where Dustin put one of his pacifiers in his mouth. “You want one?” Dustin asked his friend. “Which ones do you have?” “Well, I have light red, turquoise, purple, white, orange, and light green.” Dustin responded. <br />
<br />
“I’ll take the light red one.” Dustin then gave Jeff where he sucked on it and was delighted with how it tasted like apple juice. “You can keep that one if you like.” Dustin said. “Okay thanks.” Jeff was delighted to hear that. Suddenly, a girl ran towards their side of the woods and waddled at a nearby bush. “Umm.. we’re playing around here.” Jeff told her. “Sorry, I just need to find a place where I can go potty.” Dustin then pointed at another spot nearby. “Maybe right there would be nice, especially since we’re playing hide and seek right now.”<br />
<br />
“Oooh, I wanna play hide and seek with you guys. I know a great hiding place.” She said cheerfully. “Really?” Jeff wondered. “Yeah. I played hide and seek earlier and some of my friends couldn’t find me for a while.” “You sure about this?” Dustin asked. “Yeah, follow me if you wanna see it.” She then rushed towards another section of the forest as Jeff and Dustin were catching up on her. <br />
<br />
As the girl stopped, she squatted down as she clenched her fists and began to push. Within seconds, she was pooping out a long turd into the seat of her diaper as it bulged. All while she relieved her bladder by wetting herself, as her now full diaper was sagging between her knees when she was done. “Ah…. That feels so nice.” She patted the back of her diaper, feeling the bulge that came from it beneath her light blue skirt.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that looked like you’ve been holding it in for a while.” Jeff said to her as he admired her sloshy diaper. “Nah, I’ve had my diapee changed before. I’ve ate some snacks with my lunch before I had gotten here.” She told Jeff as they saw Tiffany waddling towards where they were in the woods. “Wow, you guys sure do know how to hide. I couldn’t find you after a while.” She said as she then looked at the girl that just met her friends.<br />
<br />
“Who’s stinking up the place?” Tiffany covered her nose. “Sorry. I went potty before you got here.” Said the girl. “I’m Melanie.” She introduced herself as her life like robot that looks like a purple sheep arrived with a diaper bag. “There you are, Melanie. I’ve been looking everywhere for you.” Her robot said with a cutesy voice. “That’s your robot?” Jeff said with an amazed look on his face.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. My mommy’s the CEO for TransDem Labs and they gave out cool robots like this since some changing incident happened.” Melanie explained. “I wish I had a robot like that. Mine just looks like a standard robot but with a humanoid body.” Jeff pouted. “Don’t worry. You can come to my house one day and I’ll give you one of my robots to keep.”<br />
<br />
Her robot caretaker then looked down at Melanie and saw her droopy diaper. “Good heavens, Melly. You need a diapee change.” She then pouted and crossed her arms. “But I’m not that stinky.” “Well, your diaper looks like you stuffed a tennis ball inside it. A stinky one if I may say so myself.” The robot teased to her. <br />
<br />
“Stop it. I’m not stinky.” She still pouted from her robot’s teasing. “Aah, it’s okay sweetie. I was just having a little fun. Now let’s get you changed.” The robot tickled Melanie a little bit before they went towards the public restroom. Jeff, being that he admired Melanie with how cute she was to him, waddled towards her to get her attention again. “Waaait.” He shouted.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” Melanie wondered. “Can I have your number?” He asked shyly. “Um.. sure. You seem very cute. And not just because you’re a little baby.” She responded before Jeff brought up his phone and gave it to Melanie before she texted out her number to him. Her text reading with a sweetiepie emoji to him. “Thank you so much.” He said happily. “You’re welcome.” She said before the robot walked with her to the public restroom.<br />
<br />
Jeff then received a text message from her mother. “Jeffy, sweetie. Dinner’s going to be ready in about half an hour, so I suggest you come back home soon.” He later responded to his mom, saying that he’ll get there as soon as possible before going back to where his friends were in the woods. “So, how was it?” Dustin asked. “From what?” Jeff wondered what he meant by that.<br />
<br />
“Being with your girlfriend.” Dustin teased him. “She’s not my girlfriend.” Jeff pouted. “Jeffy and Melly, sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in the baby carriage.” Dustin and Tiffany shouted before Jeff became annoyed. “Shut uupp.” “Relax Jeff, we’re just joking with you.” Tiffany said.<br />
<br />
“Look, I just wanted to talk to her.” Jeff had his arms crossed. “Yeah, you do.” Dustin smirked at him before Jeff pounced and tackled at him. “I said stop it!! She’s not my girlfriend!” He shouted at Dustin before Tiffany broke it up. “Jeff, it was just a tease. We didn’t really mean to make you upset.” Tiffany tried to calm him down. “But I just like her. She seemed pretty, but I don’t like her that way.” Jeff said. “Okay, but I don’t think it’s worth hitting someone about it. I think you need to have a place to cool off.” Tiffany added.<br />
<br />
“Look, I’m sorry for hitting you. I just seem to do that when people make fun of me. I’m tired of being humiliated all the time for being the weird kid where I go for the most part.” Jeff started to cry. “Yeah, we get you. But that wasn’t cool of what you did to Justin. We forgive you, but next time you shouldn’t do that to anybody.” Tiffany comforted him. <br />
<br />
“Okay. I’m just gonna leave then. My mom already told me that she’s making dinner soon, so I better get home.” Jeff told them. “Okay then. We’ll see you soon.” Tiffany said before Jeff walked his way out to the woods and went back to the park. By the time he got out, he noticed that it was starting to get dark. Jeff then thought to...</p>
