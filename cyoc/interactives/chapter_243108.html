<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>With regard to &quot;Animalia&#39;s&quot; narrative, Marcella&#39;s punishment would fit well before Easter. As there are earlier chapters that hint that it was only in a day or two... and they were also well before Easter as well. So, I suppose this could count as a &quot;backtracking&quot; chapter...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcella Walker was a bit nervous as she was strapped into a fairly large metal chair inside one of the jail cells at the Animalia Police Department station. It was a familiar place and was very spartan, which she could understand. Jail cells were not made for the comfort of the prisoners, at least not comfort when one thought of things like hotels. The chair wasn&#39;t a normal part of the cell, Marcella knew that much, but it was large and sturdy, and in fact it was borderline too big for even her, which gave her some idea that it had been used in Heather Green&#39;s punishments, years ago. As she was strapped in, she looked to where Alexandria &quot;Sandy&quot; Lynx was standing with the same male Human that had been there for her first punishment. To her surprise, the man actually looked a bit surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t this against what you do with the whole four punishments thing?&quot; the man asked curiously as Marcella looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;If being restrained in a metal chair were the limit of the punishment, I&#39;d agree,&quot; Alexandria Lynx answered with a small smile, &quot;but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s merely a component of the punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandria left one hand inside her suit pocket where she rolled a foiled wrapper for the specialized jawbreaker that was to be a component part of the punishment. Lucy Greenwall&#39;s &quot;Passion Fruit&quot; powder still sold quite well as readymade aphrodisiac that was legal and fairly popular among Animalian partners, though generally among younger or newly converted/uplifted partners who were really looking to test the sexual endurance that came with being an Animalian. There were some requirements that assured that anyone buying it had to know what it was for and its effects and also had to provide anyone that it would be given to would also be aware of their taking said aphrodisiac. It also remained one of the key parts of the four punishments, often because many of those who were selected for the four punishments often had some measure of &quot;desire&quot; contributing to part of the crime that was committed.<br />
<br />
Marcella got some hint of this when some other officers came into the cell with sets of metal easels. They were carefully clanged into place so that they could be stood before her. Then Sherry and Wanda approached caring a large metal slab, though there were slats and holes in the slab in places. Wanda then undid the restraints holding Macella&#39;s arms onto the arm rests of the metal chair she was in and then lifted both of Marcella&#39;s arms up, along with her trunk. She wanted to protest and that she didn&#39;t want THIS, but she also knew that this was also likely part of the punishment and not taking it would only make things worse. She let the two officers do what they needed to do. While Wanda held Marcella&#39;s arms and trunk up, Sherry came in and affixed the metal slab to the arm rests of the seat, and with the heavy-duty restraints fitting through the slots in the metal slab. Sherry and Wanda then went about redoing the restraints on Marcella&#39;s arms and with her trunk resting on top of the slab.<br />
<br />
The metal was cool and smooth to Marcella&#39;s trunk, but she also rapidly found there were other points to note. The biggest of this was that the improvised table was set so close to her that she couldn&#39;t lay her trunk down over her chest and toward her lap. The appendage had to lay over the top of the table, and while Marcella had gotten a lot better at using her trunk, it was not long enough to go over the table and then reach back and down toward her lap. As she figured this out, she also noted the other officers putting up a pair of photos that were scaled up to fit the large metal easels that were before her. One showed Steve Herrons with the still Human Chrissy. The other showed Steve with the Elephant Animalian Chrissy. The first was an older photo from at least a year ago and likely had been obtained through direct contact with the Moore family. The second might have been taken by Dean or Nzinga, since they were helping Chrissy adjust to being an Elephant Animalian and helping with all the travel arrangements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... Ms. Walker,&quot; Alexandria Lynx spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sure you are aware that the actions that prompted the New Years Eve incident related to your own infatuation with this young man and finding that Ms. Moore had also taken interest in him, and he accepted her advances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marcella said slowly, &quot;that was part of the whole jealousy thing... and... I suppose this punishment is going to provide a... jaw breaking reminder that he is one I cannot touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was enough for Alexandria Lynx to pull the jawbreaker from her pocket. This had been part of the four-punishment system and was one that had been quite effective. For Animalians were already known to have high libidos and it didn&#39;t necessarily take much to get an Animalian interested in sexual activity. The aphrodisiac used in the punishment was so strong that not acting on that drive could well drive an Animalian crazy, and the restraints used further assured they wouldn&#39;t be able to act on it. That was the purpose to drive Marcella&#39;s lust through the roof while rendering her unable to physically address that drive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely,&quot; Alexandria nodded and began to undo the wrapper on the jawbreaker, &quot;the candy is healthy for you, so you needn&#39;t worry on poisoning. Lucy Greenwall is quite good in making sure that all candies made are suitable for carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores of all kinds. So, you can suck on the hard shell and prepare yourself for when the main dose of the Passion Fruit is reached, or you can chew through the hard-shell and take that dose quickly. Though... it will mean a more immediate absorption of that dose. It will drive your libido sky high, and you won&#39;t be able to... scratch that proverbial itch. And for the course of that hour, you cannot mention any desire for young Mr. Steven Herrons. Any such mention... and we&#39;ll do this again at another date.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Marcella and slowly nodded and accepted the candy with her trunk. From there she curled her trunk back to her mouth and flicked the jawbreaker in. She let it rest on her tongue for a moment before softly moving it around. She knew on how potent the Passion Fruit powder that was used was, and between study sessions for her coursework, she looked over what Horizon and Animalia had put on the coverage of previous candidates who had gone through the four-punishment system. She then noted the Human man&#39;s odd look about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Marcella asked, &quot;this is my punishment, and I am complying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you... you&#39;re supposed to use your hands,&quot; the man said slowly, &quot;suppose you have a cold?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not sick, so that&#39;s not a risk,&quot; Marcella answered, &quot;and for the moment, my hands are restrained to make sure I can&#39;t reach... well... between my legs. So, I had to use my trunk to take the pill on my own. It may be embarrassing... but it&#39;s actually how elephants of all kinds use their trunks. You can follow documentaries where they drink by putting their trunk in the water and then pulling it up to their mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m human,&quot; the man shivered.<br />
<br />
Marcella didn&#39;t respond to it. Much like Chrissy, she found controlling her trunk to be a new and at times odd sensation, and the fact that she hadn&#39;t wanted to be an Animalian had meant that at times her control of the limb wasn&#39;t perfect when she started out. However, as time went on, she found that she&#39;d have to adapt to it, regardless of how embarrassing it was to have it now. She did know, however, that Chrissy wasn&#39;t having to deal the present circumstance that she was having to endure. The Passion Fruit powder was a strong aphrodisiac that Animalians in romantic relationships use to spice up their already active sex lives, and the developer of it, Lucy Greenwall, had even managed to find that with Humans, it actually served as an organic and &quot;natural&quot; alternative to things like Viagra. In the jawbreaker, a small dose of the powder was in the hard shell and would serve to excite anyone sucking on it, but once through, the more &quot;liquid&quot; gel in the middle of it would deliver the main dose. Once Marcella got to that point, she knew the effects would kick in fairly quick and would likely last for at least an hour.<br />
<br />
She sat there for a few moments as she worked on sucking on the jawbreaker. She could feel some of the preliminary effects, though for the moment that still only felt like some of the sorts of feelings she&#39;d found herself having more and more frequently as she adjusted to being an Elephant Animalian. Some of it also came from her shifts at the Meat Market to pay off her part of the damage she and Chrissy caused at Rocky&#39;s club. She did occasionally find herself looking to the male dancers there, even if they weren&#39;t Elephant Animalians and at times, she found those glances also stirring some sense of desire for them. It was embarrassing in a way, but it gave Marcella some understanding of an Animalian&#39;s libido and how easy it could be triggered. That was also why, when informed on the nature of this particular punishment among the four, that she selected the set of underwear that didn&#39;t ride up and she could afford to lose. She simply sat there and worked on the jawbreaker while Alexandria went and retrieved a pair of chairs for her and the man to sit in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this necessary?&quot; the man asked as he looked to the Bobcat Animalian prosecutor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be easier to sit,&quot; Alexandria answered, &quot;or would you rather stand for more than an hour?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken,&quot; the man grumbled, &quot;though... I fail to see how this will work. All the stories say that Animalians are horny all the time, regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a high libido, and it isn&#39;t necessarily too hard to trigger it,&quot; Alexandria answered, &quot;but we do have control over it... and it&#39;s not something that is naturally uncontrolled. Which in turn allows an Animalian to keep control over themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the reports from some of those ones that used to be older?&quot; the man asked, while watching Marcella suck on the jawbreaker, though by now the Elephant Animalian was starting to blink a little bit faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regressive Hypersexuality is more a case of where the Animalia Virus rejuvenates the body... but certain mental traumas still manifest,&quot; Alexandria answered, &quot;Most of those that suffer from Regressive Hypersexuality have generally had some issue or incident in their past that has caused high levels of mental stress... be it something as intensive as war related activities for those that were once in World War 2 as spies or foot soldiers. Some could be as minor as stresses induced by bad or pained marriages and the like. From what I know... the thought on this is in relation to the Animalian&#39;s mind looking for something that could alleviate that stress. Once they have gotten over those mental hurdles, while they might still be &quot;friskier&quot; than the average Animalian, they are in control of themselves. This is different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can&#39;t fight it?&quot; the man wondered and watched Marcella flex her hands a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alexandria answered, &quot;and the potency of the aphrodisiac will excite her to a point where she&#39;d can&#39;t resist and will WANT sexual attention... and desperately. But because of the restraints and the table, she won&#39;t be able to do anything about it. And she won&#39;t regain control until the aphrodisiac wears out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And being horny is a punishment?&quot; the man raised an eyebrow as Marcella began tapping on the table with her trunk and trying to reach over the front of it with her trunk.<br />
<br />
Alexandria didn&#39;t get to immediately answer as Marcella gave a heavy moan that temporarily cut them off. After that first moan finished, Alexandria did answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is when it&#39;s an itch that drives you made and CAN&#39;T scratch,&quot; Alexandria answered.<br />
<br />
The man looked to Marcella as she seemed to be squirming in the chair, and felt grateful that this was all being done before Easter.</p>
