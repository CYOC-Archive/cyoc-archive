<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnny closed his eyes for a second as he tried blocking out the world for a second as he tried to imagine the scene. The chatter of the restaurant was silenced and replaced with a gentle breeze with the scent of salt in the air, and the crash that comes when waves hit the beach and the friction that comes when the waves retract back into the sea. The sun in the sky was setting painting the sky a great orangish red, but still illuminating everything well enough. The two of them were alone at the table with all sorts of his favorite foods there along with a bunch of &quot;tropical&quot; feeling cocktails coming in whenever they finished their last. Having set the scene Johnny opened his eyes and found that... it seemed like everything had changed to the new setting though. It was just him and her out there on the beachfront with a restaurant a nearby, but the staff weren&#39;t really out and about... was this all his imagination?<br />
He heard Christine giggle and looked up as she said &quot;Today was a good day. I can&#39;t believe you were able to get us here all alone.&quot; Her face looked a bit red. As a romantic Johnny thought it was a blush of love, but it may have been more from drinking quite a bit as she did look a little bit like she was swaying. <br />
Johnny said &quot;Yes... I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re here...&quot; wondering how powerful his imagination was... or at this point should he say delusion? He reached out and took a buffalo wing in front of him and felt it and then took a bite. He could feel his teeth sinking into the firm flesh as juices from the meat coated his mouth along with the spicy sauce which was just the right amount of spicy for him. &quot;...I don&#39;t think I can imagine this...&quot; Johnny just stated in disbelief<br />
&quot;I know the food here is so good!&quot; Christine said eating a bite of lobster flesh. *SMACK* Christine stared at Johnny who just slapped himself seemingly pretty hard on his cheek and it started to swell a bit &quot;Johnny? Are you alright?&quot; Christine asked concerned at this random bit of self harm. <br />
&quot;Chris, we&#39;re back in the bar right?!?&quot; Christine seemed to mentally sober up a little as she saw her boyfriend panicked for some reason<br />
&quot;No... We&#39;re at this great restaurant in an island nation of... umm.... where is this?...&quot; Christine wondered, she was a little upset Johnny used her birth name instead of her preferred name but she could let that go since he was upset by something. However what was making her more concerned was the fact that as well as Johnny had set up the scene it was paper thin. Johnny&#39;s power may be able to smooth over certain things, but since both the beach and the restaurant didn&#39;t actually exist before Johnny had essentially created a small beach island with a restaurant on it and teleported the two of them there. Nothing had a name which was something you&#39;d expect from both an island and a restaurant in this day and age. Johnny couldn&#39;t believe he couldn&#39;t stop imagining this. Then again in reality he wasn&#39;t as this really was reality. Johnny got out of his seat and walked a few feat towards the sea. If this was really all in his mind something would force him back as he would walk into another table... and yet nothing stopped him as he walked towards the waves a few feat... then dropped onto the silky soft sand in disbelief. The sand was so fine and so warm he felt like he could just fall asleep there if he wanted to and yet... <br />
&quot;Johnny... is there something you want to talk about?&quot; asked a Christine who had walked after Johnny. Johnny turned to see Christine, the top a cute and pretty lady and the bottom was the jeans Chris had been wearing and an unwomanly physique. <br />
&quot;Christine... I started this evening off talking to my best friend Chris about how all the women in my life are just friends and family but not a girlfriend. He said to imagine an ideal girlfriend and I think I turned his top half into you.&quot; Johnny admitted leaving Christine speechless. &quot;Then when you were asking where I&#39;d take us on a dream date I imagined this type of scene and... Well here we are! and you&#39;re nice and all but I think I want my best friend here right now...&quot;  <br />
Christine not getting most of this said &quot;Maybe imagine that he&#39;s here then?&quot; Johnny was conflicted as he was thinking of Christine as Chris but different... now that he thought about it he essentially blanked Chris out of existence and replaced his personality with Christine. He could get Chris back but he wanted Christine to stay since she was very nice and cute... Johnny imagined a line dividing Chris&#39; lower half from Christine&#39;s upper half and divided the two cleanly. Then he imagined that Chris would grow out of his half, and Christine would grow a lower half fitting of her body... Although at this point is was less imagination and more willing. <br />
<br />
Chris just had a weird moment He was starting to guide his buddy at the bar in a mental exercise and now he was shirtless on his back on the beach. He saw Johnny above him lending a hand which he took and asked &quot;What just happened?&quot; <br />
Johnny said &quot;Apparently I can just make things happen by imagining them.&quot; Then Johnny looked behind Chris and blushed a bit which made Chris wonder what he was looking at. So Chris turned and saw a lovely red head with a nice rack and... Was she not wearing any pants... or underwear?<br />
Christine was blushing quite hard as she had dropped to the ground and covered her crotch with her hands. The thing she had always kind of hated was gone and now... She really felt like a woman fully. Of course that didn&#39;t stop her from blushing at the new dickless sensation and being bottomless in front of both her boyfriend and... his best friend she supposed. <br />
Johnny quickly imagined Christine in some form fitting jeans and said &quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t think that through far enough Christine.&quot; Christine was just blushing on the ground a bit, meanwhile Chris was still rather confused. Johnny quickly caught Chris up. <br />
Chris asked &quot;So does that make Christine and I twins or something?&quot; <br />
Johnny said &quot;Maybe? I don&#39;t know... I find out I can change reality with my thoughts and... I just wanted a friendly face during this massive change to my life.&quot; <br />
Chris looked around and saw Christine and the restaurant and said &quot;Well... Think you could give me some drinks and food on the other side of the restaurant? If what you were saying is true... My spontaneous re-existence interrupted your dream date with the ideal girl in the best place you could think to bring her for a date. May be a little awkward, but wouldn&#39;t want to stop my best friend during a... at least interesting date so far.&quot; <br />
Johnny thought for a second and then Chris seemed to vanish from the area. In reality he was teleported to the other side of the restaurant where he was going to gorge himself on delicious food and alcohol while watching something he downloaded on his phone. Johnny then walked over to Christine on the beach sand and held his hand out. &quot;Shall we continue this date?&quot;</p>
