<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily turned to the enormous board, now glowing with new results. The audience waited in breathless anticipation. As the results flashed up, a cartoonish rendering of two college guys in their mid twenties with the title below it.  It says...<br />
<br />
(Twin Brothers: Diffusion)<br />
<br />
Lesily looked to that and was intrigued by it.  &quot;Huh...  That&#39;s quite the choice.  But I can understand why.  Good old Dave here would still be alone after I separated them and it would be fitting if he has someone with him.  Let&#39;s give this one a go, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Approaching Dave on stage, she held the crystal in front of his face and told him, &quot;Dave?  Can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave remained in a trance and responded with, &quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell the audience how old you are?  We need to know since it will be part of the show.&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forty-Eight...&quot; was all he answered.<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Lesily knew that splitting them up into two would mean that they would both be 24, the perfect age for a pair of college brotehrs.  &quot;Excellent.  Now Dave, when I snap my fingers, you will diffuse into two people.  Any traits, characteristics, and physics will be divided into those two people.  You will have two new identities, but you will be twin brothers who takes different paths in college, but are bonded by blood.  Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave simply nodded as he said, &quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s all she needed to hear as she stepped away and got her fingers ready to snap.  &quot;Great!  Now...let the diffusion commence.&quot;<br />
<br />
-snap-<br />
<br />
The moment she snapped her fingers, Dave&#39;s body started to tingle.  She and the audience watched as they could see something happening to him.  Dave’s body began to glow brighter and brighter, his adult frame was swearing before to melt away like ice cream under a heat lamp.  All muscles and fat deteriorated away as arms and legs became jelly before absorbing into the increasing mass.  Body hair, nipples, and belly button started to assimilate into the melting body as his penis and balls start to suck right.  His head was loosing its facial features and hairline as the head itself merged with the mass.  What was Dave was now a fleshy blob on stage, but that&#39;s just the start of the changes.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the blob rippled before splitting into two smaller blobs as they both started to grow and take shape.  Slowly, stumps of both arms and legs grew as hands, fingers, feet, and toes formed at the ends.  Heads popped up like huge zits and took shape as facial features grew in.  Lesily and the audience could see that two people half Dave&#39;s age were being created, however, both took on different looks.<br />
<br />
For the person on the left, muscles grew and are becoming more detailed as he looked like a college body builder with a chiseled chest and eight pack abs forming.  He soon gained a bit of a tan as a tribal tattoo was etched into his arm.  Brown hair started to grow and came down his shoulders, making him look like he was more of a laid back guy.  And his rod slithered down between his thighs while his balls inflated like a pair of oranges.  Lesily looked at this one and could tell that this was Dave&#39;s athletic side.<br />
<br />
As for the person on the right, he too gain some muscles, but not as much as the other one.  He was more thinner with a much less hardened pecs and a tone stomach.  Sandy brown hair grew at the top of his head and restyled into some kind of boy cut as he gained a mustache and goatee appearance with a ring around it.  And his package was much smaller then the other person with a dick and balls that was half its size.  Lesily noticed it and thought that this was Dave&#39;s well reserved side that has more of the brains then brawn and took college lift seriously.<br />
<br />
Once the changes are done, Dave was split into twin brothers of 24 with different sets of traits.  Yet, they are both remained in a trance as their eyes are glazed over.  Lesily wondered what the brothers are and approached the one on the left and asked, &quot;Tell me, what is your name and what do you do for a living?&quot;<br />
<br />
The first brother on the left said in a machismo like voice and attitude.  &quot;My name is Dan and I&#39;m the hottest guy within the campus.  I spend time at my frat and pump muscles to get the ladies.  I don&#39;t care of studying, as long as you have a muscular body like mine with a package to boot, the whole world will be yours for the taking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily could tell that this one was a complete lunkhead and would only care about his body then his mind.  And with privates as huge as his, he likes to get laid almost every night.  Brushing off that thought, he soon asked, &quot;And do you know who is the other guy next is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan, without even looking, answered in a disgusted tone.  &quot;Oh...  That&#39;s my dorky twin brother.  He always studies all day and night without taking a break.  Just look how scrawny he is.  At this rate, he won&#39;t get a babe before graduating.   Might as well be a single guy for the rest of his sad and pathetic life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you care for your brother?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I care.  We are twins after all and we look out for each other.  I even have him do my homework from those boring classes. so it&#39;s double the work for me while I pump some serious iron.  That&#39;s how close we are.&quot; was Dan&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
Lesily sighed and knew that his bonding with his brother is all about help and would prefer hitting the gym then the books.  Guess that&#39;s why the other brother looks the way he is.  Approaching the second brother, she asked, &quot;And what of you?  What&#39;s your name and what do you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other brother was in the same trance as Dan and responded with, &quot;I&#39;m Dex.  Top graduate in college.  I spend my day going to calls and study for multiple exams and essays.  I spend my time in the library reading and when I&#39;m in my dorm, I do research and write reports.  You could say I am quite the genius.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily heard Dex&#39;s side and could tell he has Dave&#39;s intellect and maturity, unlike Dan.  She soon asked, &quot;And do you know who this...gentleman is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without looking, Dex answered, &quot;That&#39;s my idiotic brother, Dan.  He is such a tool.  Cares more for lifting weights then studying.  That lunk won&#39;t go anywhere without even reading the alphabet, let alone saying his first words.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily chuckled as his reaction to her question and soon asked, &quot;But do you care for your brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dex sighed in a hypnotic state and said, &quot;Unfortunately, yes.  I mean he is a bit of a brute and force me to do his homework to get a good grade, but he always look out for me when some bullies try to beat me down and always have my back.  Guess you could say that I have a guardian angel in the form of Dan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once she got all the information, she approached the audience and told them.  &quot;And there you have it folks, Dave has split into twin brothers, Dan and Dex.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd applaud as they were amazed at how one guy diffused into two.  Even Gloria was turned on by the Dan and his physic.  Makes her wish she was younger and back in college to hang out with such a stud.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked to the family on the other end and said, &quot;Now, we could get back to the rest of the family and see what we do with all of them.  But...&quot; she soon peered her eyes to nude brothers on stage, &quot;We might have some more fun with these two.  After all, there are other possibilities in changing them in more ways then one.  So I want you all the place your votes again.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you want to age or regress either of them, change either gender, or diffuse them once more.  The power is still in your hands.  So...  What&#39;s it going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd soon started to tally their votes as Lesily waited patiently for the results.  She wondered what the fates of the now twin brothers will be.</p>
