<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s computer flashed repeatedly, the screen alternating between his homescreen and the Chronivac program. He was scared, and debating what to do. Should he try to fix it, or would that just make things worse? Soon though, the screen stopped flashing, and Jeff breathed a sigh of relief as he saw the Chronivac&#39;s menu staring back at him. Maybe it would fix itself? His calmness was short-lived however, as a new message appeared:<br />
<br />
~MLUTIPLE ERRROR$ DTECKTED, CRORRCETING~<br />
SUBCHECKED NMAE: Jeff Richards<br />
AEG: 16<br />
GENDRE: Male<br />
TRASNFROMTAION YTPE: Full Body<br />
DRURATION: Undefined<br />
~RSEETING TO DFEAULT~<br />
<br />
&quot;Reseting to default? But nothing changed!&quot; Jeff said, before quickly checking himself over to make sure he was still normal. He didn&#39;t feel any different, but maybe it was something internal. As he patted himself down however, Jeff felt a mounting pressure in his chest. He tore his shirt off to see what was happening, and watched in horror as his chest ballooned out. Meanwhile, he suddenly fell off his chair, landing on the ground with a thud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Am I-am I growing tits?!&quot; Jeff shouted. On his chest was a pair of rounded orbs, with his nipples sitting in the middle of each one. He stared at them in shock, but something was off. They were covered with hair, seemed muscular, and why did he have a weird feeling in his butt? Jeff felt his ass, and was shocked. He didn&#39;t have buttcheeks anymore! That&#39;s when he figured it out. Jeff&#39;s bottom was just his asshole, without anything surrounding it, and his cheeks were now sitting on his chest. He heaved, trying to breath properly with the new weight on his chest.<br />
<br />
His troubles weren&#39;t over, however. Jeff felt a tug on his crotch, and watched as his cock slowly moved upwards! It was like his body was made of play-doh or something, as his dick and balls slid up to his stomach. At the same time, his belly button moved up, and his genitals comfortably took its place. Jeff barely had time to process his new belly-dick as his vision began to change. He grew nauseous as he felt his eyes move in the same way his cock did, but going downwards. His whole face moved down, and when it got to his neck, his nose wrapped around his back. He could still feel it, and soon smelled the musty scent of his pants as his nose took his asshole&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes settled on his asscheeks, giving him a massive blindspot. Down below, he could see his dick on his bellybutton, and could just barely see his mouth nestled between his legs. He writhed on the ground, in a state of pure shock. Meanwhile, his hands shifted, his fingers growing short and stubby as his palms lengthened, eventually turning into his feet. At his ankles, his hands took the place of his feet, his fists clenched as Jeff shook with terror. <br />
<br />
A loud &quot;Ding!&quot; came from Jeff&#39;s computer, drawing his attention to it. The screen read &quot;CHANGE COMPLETE-ALL ERRORS CORRECTED.&quot; Jeff turned toward his full-length mirror, and felt like vomiting. On his face, his nipples had taken the place of his eyes, with his asshole sitting where his mouth once was. His asscheeks hung from his chest, as his eyes darted around frantically. In between them, he could see his naval. His dick sat in its place, while his mouth rested in his crotch. He took heavy breaths from his nose, which sat on his ass. Jeff&#39;s feet were now on his wrists, and his hands were on his ankles, which would surely make standing up impossible. Still, he crawled back to his computer, and wrapped his right foot-hand around his chair. Leaning against it, he read the screen, his chest pressed forward and his mutated face leaning back.<br />
<br />
SUBJECT NAME: Fejf Irschrad<br />
AGE: @^<br />
GENDER: &#12414;<br />
TRANSFORMATION TYPE: None<br />
DURATION: N/A<br />
SUBJECT HAS BEEN RESTORED TO NORMAL.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!!!&quot; Jeff shouted, his voice somewhat muffled from inside his pants. Scanning the screen, he saw a &quot;Reset to Default&quot; button. He quickly pressed it...and nothing happened. He pressed it again, and again, nothing changed. Jeff pressed over and over again, before a pop-up appeared, saying &quot;Subject is already in its default state.&quot; In frustration, Jeff slammed his feet-hands against the keyboard, causing the program to close. He slowly sunk to the floor, his ass-eyes welling with tears.</p>
