<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We spend some time checking every nook and cranny of each other&#39;s bodies. Fingers, hair, ears, butt, waist, back, chest, armpit, vagina, and more. We entered a trance as we explored and showcased our bodies, by the end of our session I could say that I knew Hana’s body as well as mine and she probably could say the same about my body.<br />
<br />
When our voracious curiosity was finally sated, we both laid on the bed hugging, I had my hands on Hana&#39;s waits and she had hers on my back. As we looked straight at each other&#39;s faces I noticed Hana moistening her lips with her small tongue while making a horny expression I have never seen before on her face.  Our nipples were long, rock hard, we were hugging, so we both were aware, and my overeager pussy was producing so much love juice that I was getting concerned that I might get Hana’s bed wet. Hana then quietly intertwined her legs with mine and was and I was sure she was feeling my wetness, but curiously, she didn’t retreat; it seems that getting slathered on my juices was not a concern for her.<br />
<br />
Alas, it was getting late and we both knew that her parents would arrive home in a little while. No matter how much we wanted to keep going, this was the time to stop. <br />
<br />
“Do you want to take a bath together?” Hana suggested<br />
<br />
“Sure, ah, but I didn’t bring spare clothes with me.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I can lend you some of mine” Hana reassured me<br />
<br />
and with that I stood up, or tried to do so, but Hana told me to just stay on the bed while she prepared the bath. It seemed that she didn’t just mean a shower, but really a bath with bathing salts and everything.  <br />
<br />
Hana quickly took a pink bathrobe and went to the storage closet to get some bathing salts, it seemed that she wasn’t one to just run around the house naked like me… although lately, with my newfound discomfort of people seeing my developing chest, I haven&#39;t done that anymore. Anyways, after returning to the room she disrobed and went to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Hana’s bath was connected to her room, so I could hear her moving around and the water quickly filling the bathtub, after just five minutes she returned to the bedroom. However, it seemed that she still wasn’t satisfied with the amount of skinship we previously experienced because she tried to carry me to the bathroom in a princess carry. I thought it would feel pretty good being carried by her so I put my hands around her neck and let our bodies stay as close as possible so she wouldn’t lose balance. Being carried around felt so comfortable and… nostalgic that I considered asking my parents,  Mariah or John for a ride later, before I grew up again, but that is for another occasion. Hana could lift me and carry me to the bathtub, albeit with difficulty; my only concern was that the rubbing between our naked skins was making my previously calmed heart start beating wildly again.<br />
<br />
After entering the bathtub we shared a brief few minutes of relaxation and then playfully helped one another to wash ourselves. Something important that I had to do now, was to apply conditioner to my hair. When sporting long hair, the oils of the scalp cannot easily reach from the roots to the points; therefore, using conditioner is important to maintain my hair in good condition.<br />
<br />
After completely washing ourselves and draining the water I thought that it would be time to go out but Hana had a last surprise for me. Because she heard me about shaving my armpits before, she decided to grab a disposable razor, new of course, and be done with it.   <br />
<br />
It felt a little scratchy ,but since I had just a little hair, I quickly shaved one armpit while Hana requested to do the other for me. Later I would realize that using gel would make the process more smooth and comfortable, but fortunately my first time shaving was not too bad.<br />
<br />
After a moment we dried our bodies and took an even longer moment to dry our hairs with a blowdryer. We returned to the room and Hana presented me with the clothes she was going to lend me. A tank top and a skirt. It seems that there was a good reason to shave myself since the tank top would expose my armpits.<br />
<br />
When I took  Hana’s panties to wear, my first reaction was not shame like the first time I wore someone else’s panties (aka the last owner of my body’s panties), but a sense of closeness and excitement. Closeness because you only would share your underwear with someone very close to you, and excitement… because it felt like our pussies were sharing an indirect kiss. Perhaps, since I already considered Hana as a peer in age and gender, I could readily accept her clothes without discomfort.<br />
<br />
Feeling the fabric fitting snugly between my legs and around my ass has become something common by this point; nonetheless,  sometimes I cannot help but pass my hand around my secret parts and wonder at the fact that I have no balls dangling from my crotch.<br />
<br />
For the bra, Hana was looking for one of her old ones, but I convinced her to first try one of her new ones to better check the difference between us, and as expected, after wearing it  I could feel the void between my chest and the cups of the bra.<br />
<br />
After thinking for a moment, Hana decided to fill the cups of the bra with socks and then passed me the clothes to wear. Looking in the mirror, I could see a young woman with small breasts and wearing very feminine clothing. A tight fitting tank top that showed the contours of my body and exposed my shoulders and small skirt reaching to my tights. It was my first time wearing a skirt. It felt comfortable and gave a sense of liberation, but at the same time it felt a bit unreliable, just a gust of wind would expose my panties for everyone to see, and just the thought of it made my face flush with embarrassment.  <br />
<br />
Hana wanted me to return to my home just like that, but it was impossible for me to do that. The tank top and skirt I could accept, but if my family saw me sporting fake breasts, I would need to crawl under my bed and die of shame. <br />
<br />
After a moment we replaced the A cup bra for one of her training ones, but unexpectedly, it felt a bit too tight, she then passed me an AA cup size bra and although I could not completely fill the cups, it was almost the right size. As expected, probably in a month or so I would have to change my bras. The thought of that made me feel weird, a bit giddy and a bit embarrassed.<br />
<br />
We could hear Hana’s mom returning home, and with that as my cue, I took my leave. Since it was not dark outside yet, I could easily walk home on my own and I didn’t like to bother Hana’s mom for a ride too many times; besides this neighborhood was pretty safe.<br />
<br />
After returning home, Mom and Mariah complimented my new attire and made me do a few spins and try some different poses to appreciate my clothes better. I in turn, asked each of them to carry me in their arms around the house for a bit. I figured that soon I would start to grow again, so I better enjoy the experience of being small and light enough to be lifted while I can.</p>
