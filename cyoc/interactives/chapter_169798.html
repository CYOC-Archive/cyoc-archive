<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jaymee just shrugged and tried to take off the nose. No tricks, no funny business, just simply taking off the clown nose. Simply was not the way that it went out though. It didn&#39;t want to come off. It stuck like glue. It did make honking noises which made Jaymee giggle, but Jamie only responded with an annoyed pout. Jaymee was really confused. If she felt like people had enough fun, she would remove a nose with ease. There shouldn&#39;t have been a problem here, so she didn&#39;t know why it wasn&#39;t working. Of course, her idea of shrugging it off would not be wise considering the very annoyed and possibly aggressive Jamie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... I have a idea *hyuck*&quot;<br />
<br />
She placed one shoe on Jamie&#39;s leg and managed to stand upright... horizontally. Jamie was weirded out. This wasn&#39;t normal, but then again, what has been in the last few hours? Jaymee rubbed her gloves together, and forcefully pulled on the nose, lifting it away, trying to pry it off. For Jamie, it felt like her skin was pure elastic. Her stance was mainly the same, with a slight pull, but she still had two clown feet firmly placed on the ground of her subconscious. Jaymee continued to pull and pull, trying her hardest to remove this clown nose from her, but nothing to get it loose. Jaymee ended up tripping over herself, letting go and watching the nose snap back into place like nothing had happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! Careful! I just want this stupid clown nose removed, and not get a trunk as well!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jaymee giggled at the idea, stood up and dusted herself off. &quot;It won&#39;t budge. It&#39;th like it&#39;th attached to you, like a pet! Awww! Widdle cute clown nothe... I would take you home with me if you weren&#39;t tho attached to the other me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get. It. Off&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t get the nothe off ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
A mix of shock, embarrassment and pure anger went through her mind. &quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thorry, Jay-Jay, I can&#39;t get it off ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Firmly pointing directly at Jaymee, she poked and prodded at her dress, and nose, which made Jaymee giggle more than anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T Jay-Jay me, you... you... you freak!&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Nerd Jamie was clutching her head, experiencing some sort of strong migraine that made her feel ill to her stomach. She clutched at the head, and her stomach, as she felt they twisted to the mere strain that was going on. She couldn&#39;t take it. She just couldn&#39;t. Was it... the mirror... was it... doing... this...<br />
<br />
The sound of a door opening, and a few footsteps, weren&#39;t enough to get her out of this pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie? Are you home? The gang invited us to a chess club reunion. I know reunion parties are not something that we are into, but I feel like the chess club will be incredibly sensible with the party. Plus Nat&#39;s Mum does those lemon tarts that I know you love so mu-&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of a body collapsing took Dexter out of his conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie? JAMIE?!&quot; He ran to her bedroom, finding her on the floor, holding her stomach. His immediate response was to hold her hand. &quot;Jamie, Jamie, can you hear me? Let me know if you can hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Dethter...&quot;<br />
<br />
He grasped her hand, holding it to him gently. &quot;Jamie, what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...they&#39;re in my head...&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know what she meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what do you mean? Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jamie saw a bright light within Nerd Jamie&#39;s mind. She didn&#39;t understand what it meant... but she could hear the voice of Nerd Jamie getting stronger. She was walking inside, into the subconscious, meaning... she can finally get help! She could take control, talk to Dexter and explain what is happening! Her appearance didn&#39;t matter, all that matters is that someone helps and helps now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Nerd Jamie... I need Dexter to understand this... for all of us&quot;<br />
<br />
She ran, running into the white light, blinding her vision, until she found herself on the floor of the bedroom. The same place as Nerd Jamie. Perfect!<br />
<br />
&quot;IT WORKED! I can&#39;t believe it! It actually worked. Okay, I don&#39;t know how much time I have left&quot; She didn&#39;t look up as she tried to see if she was completely there. No new additions to her body apart from the already clownified look thanks to her worse third, but that didn&#39;t matter. &quot;Okay, I know that this looks weird, and I&#39;m sure that you are wondering what happened to your Jamie, Dexter, or how I know you in anyway, or why I&#39;m dressed up like a clown, I can explain it. I&#39;m a different Jamie. I&#39;m a Jamie from another... world, I guess, and if you can please just help me understand what&#39;s happ-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie wasn&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
She was back in her room. <br />
<br />
She was still back in her room, things still awry with the unpacking. No awards on shelves. No posters of anime shows or clowns. No personalized jacket. No trophies for intellect or best performances. No supportive boyfriend. <br />
<br />
She was back. <br />
<br />
Sure, back dressed as a Clown, but... she was back. This was what she wanted. To be back in her own room. Back to be herself.<br />
<br />
This is what she wanted... wasn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
The room was spacious now. It felt empty. And she didn&#39;t feel like unpacking would help things out much. She looked at the bags of clothes that she washed and dried recently. All of them were bland. None of them were formal. None of them looked colourful enough. It felt... grey. Lifeless. Dull. She sat down, on her bed, looking down on the carpet below. <br />
<br />
This is what she wanted. To be back? Why did this feel... worse than being the others? ...Oh god, the others, Jaymee can&#39;t change Nerd Jamie! ...but she didn&#39;t feel that. She didn&#39;t feel the strangeness of Nerd Jamie becoming what old Jamie now looked like.<br />
<br />
Old Jamie...<br />
<br />
She felt within herself that the only thing that Jaymee was doing was making Nerd Jamie laugh. It wasn&#39;t like how she laughed. She basically broke down into tears of laughter. Nerd Jamie was... stable. She was fine. She was just enjoying the company. No changes or noses to be added. Coming back fresh and happy. Just... fun.<br />
<br />
Why didn&#39;t she feel good about returning? Why couldn&#39;t she explain it? They were happy, enjoying their own company made from each other... and... yet she felt worse. Maybe it was better that she was Nerd Jamie. Nerd Jamie had the intellect. The brains, the achievements, the groups of friends that didn&#39;t try to stab themselves in the back within a moments notice. <br />
<br />
Hell, even Jaymee had something. Both had their own style, Nerd Jamie was formal, and had polite attire, and Jaymee could walk through a rainbow and still have the most colourful clothes out there. They weren&#39;t even that bad, and they were incredibly comfortable. So, what did she have? A couple of t-shirts. Few sweatpants maybe. <br />
<br />
They all achieved something, and from what Jamie saw around her was... nothing. She was technically wearing the achievements of another version of her, not the Jamie that she is. She had nothing to prove. Nothing to show for. Her own self was just... she didn&#39;t feel like anything. She just sat there, wondering who she was. And who really deserved this life.<br />
<br />
Why did this even happen? Why did the mirror show her and let her become this? What was there to prove? Was it just to make herself miserable? She had to find answers. And she needed them now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it&quot;<br />
<br />
The mirror, unlike in Nerd Jamie&#39;s room, wasn&#39;t covered up. She took what could be her final glance at her life for all she knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... Jamie... Jaymee... I need answers... I don&#39;t care if I get one or two or eighty-three new personalities... I need to know why this is happening...&quot;<br />
<br />
She breathed in... and she looked at the mirror... maybe it&#39;s best to let this Jamie go...<br />
<br />
...but not before she knew why...</p>
