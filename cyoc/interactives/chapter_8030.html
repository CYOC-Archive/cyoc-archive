<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All seemed to easy as his dear wife believed the crazy story he told. Now feeling at ease he slipped out of his clothes and into a pair of pajamas. It was then the sight of his bestial parts a nervous fear began to take hold.<br />
<br />
The orgy he had taken willing part in left it's mark. He'd have to live the rest of his life with goat genitals and shaggy thighs, butt, and groin. No longer could he swim at the W.M.C.A.! No longer could he sun bathe at their cottage along Lake Michigan. No more wearing shorts in simmer as the goat hairs thinned out halfway down his shins.<br />
The worst was his love for the wife could not be shown until she had somehow been told of his physical change. Told she must be, but as yet how could he ever explain the magic of the Medallion and expect to live in a college town.<br />
<br />
As Myron snuggled into his bed a caring wife came upstairs and offered him a hot cup of Grey tea and a graham cracker or two. The shades drawn and his head aching from the fall in the garage he slipped into a rest filled sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; yelled Myron as he jolted awake and looked around.<br />
<br />
He was alone and a dream so real had scared ten years off his life. He sat on the edge of the bed huffing and breathing heavy as the slight memory of the dream came around for an instant replay.<br />
<br />
There he saw himself again with Miss Winter and her looking like something out of wet sex dream or an xxxx girlie movie. How he could remember her large succulent breasts, her slender form and tight butt. She was as if made or being rebuilt by the Medallion's curse to be one of the most compelling sex objects ever placed before a man.<br />
<br />
Sitting and still sweating as if he'd run a long mile on a summer's day he felt drawn and weak. Looking to the clock he saw if was after 8 p.m. and his wife and children were not to be heard about the house.<br />
<br />
Myron got up slowly and picked up his robe he twisted the belt tight to hold the front closed. Into the hallway he walked his head still pounding and down the grand staircase to the foyer. A peering look to the driveway and there he saw the garage door open, one car gone and all the backyard lights burning kilowatts.<br />
<br />
Down the hall into the kitchen he went and there hung on the fridge was a note from his wife.<br />
<br />
Myron, I left a sandwich in the fridge, chips in the cupboard. I'm so upset about your fall! Those people not even calling me, I'm driving down to have a few words with them and how angry I am. Be home late,<br />
The Home-front Boss!<br />
<br />
Placing his hands to cover his face Myron let out a most animal scream. Anger and fear welled up inside him at the possible thought of his dear wife' being led or shoved through the doorway to the barn and ending up worse off than himself.<br />
<br />
A quick dash had Myron in his study and frantic to find the phone number of the Winter's Farm. At last he found the note and punched the numbers into his phone.<br />
<br />
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, Hello Winter's Farm and petting Zoo! said Miss Winter in her sweet and soft voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Myro...................!&quot; Myron started to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Myron you have the nicest wife I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Oh but she was so angry about your falling and had to see the spot herself. I told AJ. to stay out of sight till i could tell her in some kind way about him. I know that most people don't take too well when approached by a satyr! Anyway she walked about and when I suggested we go back to the house, that's when she slipped just like you did last Friday.&quot; explained Miss Winter.<br />
<br />
&quot;She slipped, or was pushed? I don't care, let me talk to her, is she alright?&quot; asked Myron getting a good bit of panic going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myron, I didn't push her she tripped and slid down the slight rise of a hill. She was as clumsy as you till her feet and legs slipped past the barn's open door. I called to her to push her hands on the door case and then stand up. Your wife was a stubborn woman with her own way of doing things!&quot; said Miss Winter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes true she is stubborn, but what do you mean she was clumsy?&quot; asked Myron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said Myron, she was stubborn and instead of standing up once she was outside the door and crate she stood up in the doorway. She soon felt a sincere desire to meet AJ the two of them have been upstairs now a good two hours!&quot; she said with a chuckle and a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's bad enough that I look like this and you don't have to make my wife look like me too!&quot; pleaded Myron.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Myron she wouldn't have changed a bit had she pushed herself back out the doorway and then stood up, she's stubborn and wanted to do it her way. She's not like you, oh no!&quot; said Miss Winter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank....she's not like me! You mean she's the same as when she got there right!&quot; said an angry sounding Myron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.....no! When she stood up it was in the doorway to the barn and when she turned around to walk out is when she stepped into the rim of the crate. She did changed, she's very much like AJ now as her form is a satyress form. She's so mature looking and yet gained renewed youth. I think her face looks so neat crowned with the six inch long black horns that sprouted quickly after we got to the house. It was her idea to shed the clothing and then hand in hand she and AJ went upstairs. Her brunette hair has darkened to almost jet black. As I her hair is shaggy goat wool falling down from her head, to her back as a ridge like tuft covers her spine. The wool flares out so neatly at her thighs. Her butt which was plump is much tighter and actually reminds me of my own. The thighs changed and legs with feet look like AJ's, total goat in shape. She can stare right through you with her bright yellow pupils, AJ loves them I know! The two of them are in the midest of another round just listen!&quot; says Miss Winter as she holds the phone receiver toward the door leading to the upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, huh, huh, ahhh AJ, more, deeper, more, fuck me like you meant to hurt me! Oh AJ, oh, I want more, Myron just doesn't have anything that compares to you, huh, huh!&quot; said Myron's wife now satyress and whoring.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO DAMN IT NO, what of my kids?&quot; asked a frantic Myron fuller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh their fine, after the Misses came out of the barn so excited the two teenagers flew through the open door and ran out the other side of the crate into the pasture. I'd say that neither one of them remember's their Mother or Father and are the kids as kids they now will love to remain.&quot; explained Miss Winters as a thud was heard at Myron's end of the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missy, please come up here and show Misses Fuller those new stretching moves that make me so very hard!&quot; asked AJ in between some heavy breathing.<br />
<br />
Who can say how long Myron lay fainted dead out on the kitchen floor. Yet when he awoke the one thing on his mind was to drive down state to the Winter's farm and talk with the Misses.<br />
<br />
Out to the garage he ran, jumping into his sports car and off down the highway. A record time I'm sure it was as Myron drove toward what was left of his world. Spitting and throwing stones from his tires he sped up the farm's driveway.<br />
<br />
Upstairs on the king sized bed lay Misses Fuller enjoying her new and sensual body. AJ on top humping away and in full sweat of that rich moment. Miss Winter looking out the window and spraying some perfume over her goat wool hair, ready to meet one angry and maybe extra horny male.</p>
