<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff leans back in his armchair and waits for Darren to start explaining, “I hope this will make sense,” the teen says, “because… I just can’t believe my dad being a Secret Agent. It’s just to… weird.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Darren says, “all I can do is tell you the truth, it is up to you if you believe it or not.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugs, “okay, Darren,” he says, “let’s hear it.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” he says, “before your dad met your mother, who, by the way, is really attractive, anyway… before your dad met her, he already was working for the NSA as a spy.”<br />
<br />
“Okay… hold it right there,” Jeff says, “you are telling me, that my dad is a freaking spy?”<br />
<br />
“He sure is,” Darren says, “he actually met your mother on one of his missions.”<br />
<br />
“Dad told me he met my mom in Spain at an event,” Jeff says, he then tilts his head, “come to think of it, when I asked him what kind of event, he kinda acted weird. He looked around, as if afraid that someone might listen, he then said it was some kind of business dinner with one of his contractors.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “and you had a weird feeling, that your dad was not fully truthful, right?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I think I was six or seven,” he says, “I did find it kinda weird, the way he acted, I kinda could tell that he wanted to say more but somehow way unable to.”<br />
<br />
Again Darren nods, “that’s because the “meeting” was actually a meeting between two criminal groups, the “Vipers” and the “Scorpions”, both are very dangerous groups. Your dad was undercover as one of the bodyguards of the Viper leader.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Darren says, “one question, Jeff: have you ever noticed a tattoo on your dad? Like just above his wrist?”<br />
<br />
“I… I actually did,” Jeff says, “when I was 12, I kinda surprised him by barging into his room. He was getting ready for work and only had pants and a tank top on. When I barged in I saw him get a shock and grab a button up shirt with long sleeves. He yeld at me for barging in, I was kinda surprised, but I remember noticing a weird snake like tattoo on his, I think, right wrist.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “members of the “family” all need to have that tattoo, and it is always on the right wrist,” he says, “let me get something real quick.” Jeff watches as Darren gets up and walk over to a file cabinet. He watches as the man opens a drawer and pulls out a file, he then walks back to Jeff and sits down, he then holds out the file to the boy and says, “take a look, and tell me if you notice something.”<br />
<br />
Jeff takes the folder and opens it, the folder is filled with pictures of different men, all dressed in black suits and seem to be armed to the teeth. “Damn, these pictures are scary, the look on these people’s faces is just… evil,” he says, he flips through the pictures, then he lets out a gasp, “it… can’t be!” He looks up at Darren, “holy f… hell,” he says.<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “yep,” he says, “your dad has the symbol of the “Viper” family.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks back at the picture, he then closes the folder and hands it back to Darren, “I… I don’t understand,” he says, “dad still has the tattoo… d-does that mean he is still a “member” of the f-family?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Darren says.<br />
<br />
“B-but then why does he still have the tattoo? Why not… you know get rid of it,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Darren shrugs, “there are a number of reasons,” he says, “some spies decide to keep the “branding” as a reminder of dark times. Some might decide they prefer the “branding” than a scar, who knows… your dad has his reasons why he decided to keep the tattoo.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Jeff says, he looks up at Darren, “please tell me, how did my dad get out?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Darren says, “as you know, your parents met at this “meeting”. Your mother is actually the daughter of the boss of the “Vipers”.”<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Jeff shouts.<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “here, take a look at this picture,” he says and hands Jeff a picture from the folder.<br />
<br />
Jeff takes it with a shaky hand, his eyes widen in horror, there on the picture were his parents, surrounded by heavy armed men. “Th-this can’t be real,” Jeff breaths, “b-but there is no denying the photo,” he hands it back to Darren, “I can’t believe I am related to… to… to a criminal family.” <br />
<br />
Darren takes the picture, “I understand, that this information must be a shock for you, Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at Darren, “wh-what happened after my parents met?”<br />
<br />
“Well, your parents fell in love,” Darren continues, “they started seeing each other in secret. It is a rule of the “Vipers” that no one of the own “family” is permitted to marry the daughter or son of the family leader. The punishment is death, so they had to meet in secret,” he pauses to let the information sink in.<br />
<br />
Jeff shakes his head, “this is so… unreal,” he says, “please… what happened next?”<br />
<br />
“Well, your parents were dating in secret for two years,” Darren continues, “your mother found out that she was pregnant. She and your dad decided to run away, your mother knew your dad was a spy, but she kept it a secret and did not blow your dad’s cover, out of love.”<br />
<br />
“So… they decided to run away,” Jeff says, “to… prevent me from being taken away and my father killed? They did it to protect me.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “correct,” he says, “but, your granddad, the father of your mother, found out, he put a hit on your entire family,” he looks at Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “that is why we moved so much,” he says, “every time my parents felt that mom’s family is closing in… they’d… .”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “you are pretty smart, Jeff,” he says, “that is exactly the reason why you moved so much.”<br />
<br />
“Wow…,” Jeff says, “man, my head is buzzing with all this information,” he says, rubbing his temples.<br />
<br />
“I can imagine,” Darren says, “do you hate your parents? Now that you know the truth?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks at Darren for a while, “no,” he says, “I don’t hate them, I actually am thankful to them, for keeping me and my little brother safe. I can’t imagine how hard it must be, especially for mom: always on the run from her own family.” He looks at Darren, “so, how come you know all of this,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Your dad and I, we both worked for the NSA,” he says, “while your dad chose to continue to work for the agency, I chose to quit and become a “One-Man-Spy”.”<br />
<br />
“So… you decided to become a bad guy,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Yes and no,” Darren says, “I decided to be a so called “Mechanic”, a ex-spy who takes on tasks from normal citizens, government agencies, criminals, terrorists, gangs, “families”…, it depends on my client. I don’t ask questions, I just do what is asked of me.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” Jeff says, “that actually sounds like an exciting life. I guess that is why you have no… family of your own.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “I prefer it that way,” he says, “a part of me would love to have a wife and kids, but… I know I’d put them in danger. So, I decided to stay alone.”<br />
<br />
“Jesus,” Jeff says, “that must be hard.”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “it is, but I am used to it,” he says with a sad smile.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at the portrait, “if you don’t mind me asking,” he says, “who’s that?”<br />
<br />
Darren looks at the portrait, “that… is me with my parents,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “whoa,” he says, “you really look as if you were born into a rich family.”<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “yes, my family is rich,” he says, “since I am the only child, I inherited everything, including this Ranch and the whole area the Ranch is located at.”<br />
<br />
“Man,” Jeff says, “I am kinda curious to see more of this place. To be honest, I kinda like it here,” he looks at Darren, “and you seem to be a nice guy. I honestly do not feel I am in danger, I kinda sense that you could never harm any one.”<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “you are really good at reading people,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I got that from my dad,” he says.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “so, how are you feeling after all this?”<br />
<br />
“I feel kinda confused,” Jeff admits, “but also kinda relieved, because I always felt that my family had some dark secret. Now that I know the truth, I do feel glad and happy,” he looks at Darren with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Glad to hear that,” Darren says, smiling back, “anything else you want to know?”<br />
<br />
“Um… just one more thing,” Jeff says, “wh-what are you going to do to me? Will I ever see my parents again?”<br />
<br />
“I won’t harm or do anything to hurt you,” Darren says, “you will return to your family, but for now, I need you to stay here for a while. It does get kinda lonely and I could do with some company.”<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, he then shrugs, “I guess I’m fine with staying,” he says, “I kinda like the idea to be away from my family for a while. This’ll also give me time to get my mind sorted and calm down before returning to my family.”<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “let me show you to your room then,” he says, “I guess you are pretty drained from this weird day.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “hell yeah,” he says.<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “by the way, Jeff,” he says, “why didn’t you ask about the file I took from your house?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “even though a part of me would like to know,” he says, “I think it would be best NOT to know. It is none of my business, I just hope my family, especially my dad and mom won’t be in any danger.”<br />
<br />
“I promise, Jeff,” Darren says, “they are in no danger. I actually keep an eye and tabs on you and your family, I still consider your dad a friend. I have been protecting your family from the shadows, I’ll never let anything or anyone harm you, your dad, your mom and your brother.”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “good to know that we have such a guardian angel,” he chuckles.<br />
<br />
Darren snorts, “a guardian devil would be more fitting for me,” he says, then laughs, “I am not really an “angle”. Let me show you to your room, it is time we both get our rest, I’ll show you the rest of the house and Ranch tomorrow, if you like.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Jeff says, “looking forward to it,” he adds with a smile.</p>
