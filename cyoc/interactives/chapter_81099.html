<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But you said,&quot; but Madame was on him, finger at his lips, before he could mouth a protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said they wouldn't choose.  Semantics, Dougy.&quot;  And her hands were at his pants, unbottoning and zipping them until they were around his feet.  &quot;I work quickly folks,&quot; she announced.  &quot;When I want too that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
His boxers joined his pants on the ground and a breeze, from nowhere, struck him oddly across his crotch.  Before Doug could look down her hand was at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't say the Madame doesn't give the people what they want.&quot;  She stepped away but traced her fingers along the lips of Doug's newly made slit as she did.  He shuddered and immediately blushed.  The crowd beheld  the puffed lips and inviting look of a nubile pussy with just a bit of hair and a trail to brighten up the otherwise manly vestiges.<br />
<br />
There was then a scratching noise from behind and one of the stagehands had a folding chair setup behind Doug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to sit for this, Doug.&quot;  Madame suggested but pushed him down into the chair while walking up behind.<br />
<br />
She leaned in again, at his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;  Doug asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I saw what you had in mind and I happen to agree.&quot;  Doug's heart felt a bit better then, though some part of him was still worried.  &quot;But as I said before, enjoy this.  For your own good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Madame stood up and reached down in front of Doug and began to spread his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Doug, have you ever fingered a girl before?&quot;  She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;  Doug responded, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is a lot like that only,&quot;-and she took his hand once his legs were spread, pussy showing to the entire crowd, and placed it just above the clit- &quot;you'll know when you do it right this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wink only he could see, Madame pushed his hand down onto the clit and helped the first rub.  Doug gasped as a the pleasure hit him like nothing he had known from his cock having days.  Once she assisted with the initial motion, she left Doug's hand which didn't lose to the rhythm.  The Madame stepped away for a moment then leaned over his face; his mouth was open, small groans escaping it, and his eyes were fluttering shut.  She made sure his glasses were safety set on his face before stepping back towards the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll probably still need those later so don't need them coming off.&quot;  Unlike most other times, no one paid her much attention as their gaze was affixed on the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't he gonna turn into something?&quot;  One man shouted.<br />
<br />
Madame nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;His change is brought on by his, arousal.  The more he goes the more he changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another man fixed his own glasses then turned to the Madame, &quot;So if he stopped he would stop changin'?&quot;  He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, yes, but,&quot;-and she glanced back at Doug who had slid lower in the chair, spread his legs further apart, and added his other hand to the mix; plunging it into himself slowly-&quot;do you really think he'll stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man saw the look on Terry's face, one of pure bliss, and understood what the Madame meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, definitely ain't gonna stop,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Madame looked down at him from the stage and noted his look.  Older, probably forties, with just strands of hair left, a weak jaw, misshapen body, and his pants down around his feet and hands struggling to find his own manhood in his briefs.  An idea popped into her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you help Doug out?&quot;  She asked but it was more of an offer.  He looked at her, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on up and help him into his new life.&quot;  Her voice was sweet and his mind was drunk with lust.  To decline was just as likely as Doug was to stop.<br />
<br />
He crawled up onto the stage, rather unceremoniously, and began to tug down his briefs when a soft hand at his shoulder stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh uh uh,&quot; Madame said, wagging her finger before pointed to her own mouth, &quot;Just use this, hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a few seconds to register it but when it did hit him, he nodded hearty and rushed over.  Getting down on hands and knees, he got up right into Doug's slit, pushed his hands out of the way and dug in.  For his own part, Doug was going to protest but soon found himself unable, especially when he caught sight of the darkening of his nose.<br />
<br />
Some men, seeing this, protested; feeling that their view had been spoiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not worry, guys.&quot;  Madame calmed them.  &quot;You'll still get quite a nice sight so gather close and watch.&quot;  <br />
<br />
And no sooner had they grouped directly behind where the man was kneeling over then they saw his butt begin to swell, straining his briefs. <br />
<br />
&quot;You see,&quot; Madame began, kneeling down near the man's behind, &quot;once a person is infected with my magic they become something of a plague or a curse.  Their,&quot; Madame searched for the right word, &quot;juices, if you will, can have a very,&quot; the man's brief's tore a bit more, &quot;very,&quot; and a bit more, tufts of black fur poking threw, &quot;very strong effect on people.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tighty-whities burst into a shower of fabric that, once cleared, revealed a rotund, lady-like, rump covered with fine black hairs that led down the back of the thighs.  As the man dug into Doug's pussy further, completely unaware of himself, his legs spread a bit revealing a slit of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now his changes are happening much faster than Doug's,&quot; Madame stepped back and pointed at Doug who did not appear so far along.  Mostly it was his face which had pushed out into a muzzle, his hair had gone jet black and gotten longer, and his ears had gone higher on his head.  His features were definitely more feminine though his glasses remained on his face still- not his his eyes were open.  Aside from that, from as much as most in the audience could tell, he was the same.<br />
<br />
The man, on the other hand, was quickly revealing the species once his tail grew in long, black, and flared with a white stripe.<br />
<br />
&quot;A skunk...&quot; went the whispers amongst those watching and the Madame could only watch and wait.<br />
<br />
His hips got wider and the rest of his legs went black with fur.  Stomach flattened and men leaned low to the stage to see his breasts, heavy and heaving, grow in to dangle under his shirt rather obviously.  His arms went from the ground to up around Doug's thighs just in time for them to slim and fur out.  When he needed a breath of air, his lifted head revealed a face that look much akin to Doug's if maybe a bit fuller and muzzle wet with juices.  This last part was quickly enhanced when the man's new, longer tongue licked around the mouth before plunging back in.<br />
<br />
Doug was now changing more, as he grasped wildly at his shirt as flesh gathered behind a quickly swelling pair of breasts whose nipples, dark black, were clear for everyone to see.  Doug even took a moment to look down at them, and at the man, but didn't seem to care about either when he threw his head back and continued moaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta get me some of that!&quot;  Screamed a man in the front row who was already up on the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't do that if I were you,&quot; Madame noted as he undid his fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, bitch,&quot; he snapped.  The Madame could only smile as he approached the man's somewhat presented butt.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the tail, which had been flicking out, and readied himself to enter when there was a sudden spray across his face followed by a horrid stench.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you,&quot; Madame tisked.  &quot;You frightened her and now,&quot; but the man was already clutching at his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happenin,&quot; his voice was already softer, sweeter than it had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you the juices are contagious.  Doug changes slow, this man went faster and you,&quot; he had dropped to his knees as the fur sprouted up from under his shirt and all down his legs.  &quot;You will set a new record I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Within ten seconds he went from horny male to buxon, confused skunk-fem in the tatters of his old shirt.  A stagehand came up behind him with a towel and hauled him off, even as he tried to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming up on stage when not invited is never a wise decision.  You all know that now but he'll sadly never learn from that as he'll soon be a normal ol' skunk we'll release into the wild.  Oh well.&quot;  And just like that she returned to the other two.<br />
<br />
The man was completely changed by now and Doug was just getting into the final stages;  his nails went black and his legs got slimmer and with a cheer from the crowd both he and his little helper orgasmed to a close.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a lovely display, wouldn't you say?&quot;  Madame lapped up the applause while the two men, now female anthro skunks, adjusted their glasses and took stock of their new bodies.<br />
<br />
While the crowd clapped, whistled, and finished jerking off, Madame signaled for two more stagehands to come up and escort them off.  The man went easy enough, still not quite grasping what happened, buy Doug had enough senses left to lean over to the Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's gonna happen to,&quot; but he stopped once he heard his soft, feminine voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your friend will be released into the wild, sadly, as a full skunk once the rest of the magic kicks in.  As for you, Doug,&quot; she looked him up and down.  &quot;They'll take you to my cabin and we'll discuss your future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug hardly found this appealing but the option was better than becoming a total skunk so he let himself be led off by the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what shall we do next?&quot; she put to the still frothing audience.</p>
