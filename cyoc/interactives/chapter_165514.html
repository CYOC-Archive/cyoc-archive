<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Lorenzo woke from the effects of the gas, his trepidation at the thought of what his body might now be like made his breath catch in his throat.  He knew he felt different, and couldn&#39;t yet bring himself to open his eyes.  When he did, would he see a girl&#39;s body?<br />
<br />
He forced his eyes open, and looked down to behold himself.  Wait, this wasn&#39;t right.  He was smaller, yes, but he didn&#39;t exactly look like a female given that he had no breasts or figure at all.  But, his dick...  Reaching down his pants he probed for information, until his hand found flatness, and then...lips, a vagina.  He was a girl?<br />
<br />
The thought made his head spin.  He was a girl?  It was so...so...exciting!  I mean it was terrifying, to be sure, and no he wasn&#39;t trans, as far as he could determine, but he had dabbled in private cross-dressing a few times, and more and more he&#39;d begun to feel a sort of envy of femininity, and to have a fetish for possessing female sexuality.  There was just something so special about their beauty, their grace, even their fragility, and something so erotic about being vulnerable.  There was no denying now that he was vulnerable.  There was an open hole in his body, a hole that could be invaded, and in a pleasurable way that would allow his invader power not only over his body but also over his inner self.  He&#39;d lost the physical capacity to invade, to impress himself upon a willing female with power, and had become that which, at least on a physical level, was fundamentally less powerful.  There were many strong women, certainly, but there was no denying the plain truth of the vulnerable nature of their bodies, and now that described his body.  The thought should have terrified him.  God, he could be raped.  And it did terrify him, but he found himself more aroused than terrified.  Even outside of arousal there was strangely something nice about being less powerful in and of itself.  Somehow the very absence of his cock and balls, while in some sense humiliating, was actually totally liberating, not to mention exhilarating in its danger.  It made him feel like he didn&#39;t HAVE to be powerful anymore.  Males had a responsibility to be manly, but females were free of that responsibility since it was an impossibility for them, and by embracing that they achieved grace and softer wisdom that was beautiful. He knew it was illogical to attribute all that to a simple sexual organ, a small lump of flesh between his legs, but whether the instinct to do so was biological or culturally ingrained, there was no denying that it was powerful, pervasive, and unavoidable, and he&#39;d never have been fully free of it while he had a dick.  <br />
<br />
Females had their shackles too, of course, their expectations put on them by society, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel as he pulled his pants forward to look at his new pussy that those expectations now began to apply to him.<br />
<br />
He decided he wanted it.  He wanted all of it, everything it meant to be female, at least long enough to experience it.  They&#39;d change back at the end of the year, right?  Then so be it, he&#39;d be female.  He&#39;d go the full distance, embrace every social expectation and stereotype, get the full experience of being a girl, good and bad, and at least return to manhood at the end of the year with a greater understanding.<br />
<br />
Then principal Kellers began his evil speech and performance, and Lorenzo was as terrified as anyone.  This person was crazy, and wasn&#39;t going to ever let him turn back, and furthermore would enslave him, but it didn&#39;t seem there was anything they could do against his power.  Then Kellers explained that their transformations were not complete, but would be completed when they gave in to sexual pleasure.<br />
<br />
The thing is, terror and arousal are not at all mutually exclusive, and sometimes very much go hand in hand.  Lorenzo knew about himself that he was aroused by losing control.  He&#39;d always liked the idea of dominant women, bondage, rape roleplay, etc..  Now that sexual loss of control was threatening, promising to become real, and that wasn&#39;t a joke, it was terrifying, but that didn&#39;t stop it from being hot.<br />
<br />
Given that resistance was futile anyway, he steeled himself and pulled down his pants to get a good look at his...his pussy.  He knew that one way or another his relationship with her was about to become a lot more intense.  His breathing grew ragged just looking at her, and at the thought of what he was about to do.  Cautious but desiring, he reached a single finger down and lightly caressed the surface.<br />
<br />
A jolt of pleasure surged through him, charged from this new womanhood all the way up to his brain and then out to his fingertips, not forgetting to stop by his heart and soul on the way for a quick rattling of his world.  How?  How could it feel so good, a single touch?  Well, Kellers had said something about their pleasure capacity being magically magnified.<br />
<br />
There was something else, though.  Something had changed in his psyche.  There was a new energy inside of him.  What was it?  He didn&#39;t know...but he knew it wanted more.  He touched her again, and the pleasure coursed through him again...and then he knew what this energy was.  It was femininity.  His mind was changing, becoming more girlish, and this new growing girly side of him wanted her pussy tended to, wanted to grow and flourish.  <br />
<br />
It was terrifying, and it ought to have cooled his ardor, but it only increased it.  The idea of having his mind itself altered, well, that was like something out of a hypnotism erotica, which also appealed to him.  But could he do this?  Could he change himself completely, change who he was, for mere pleasure?  It was insane.  Totally insane...and totally, completely, the hottest thing that could ever happen.<br />
<br />
Then he noticed self animated tendrils of magical energy approaching him, summoned by Kellers.  He watched them chase down and capture other girls, and force them orgasmicly into girlhood, but when they approached him, they stopped, as if watching.  They wanted him to do it to himself.  He knew they&#39;d do him if he didn&#39;t, though, so they were taking the choice away from him.<br />
<br />
Yes, that was it.  That was why his hand returned to between his legs, and this time slipped a finger inside. It wasn&#39;t that he really wanted to...to jill himself to a girly oblivion, to let this pleasure take him, transform him, he just had no choice...<br />
<br />
That was what he told himself as he moaned, a sound he&#39;d never been capable of before, his voice rising in pitch.  That was what he told himself as he watched his new tits begin to blossom, what he told himself as he slipped a second finger inside, as he reached up with his other hand to caress the soft expanding tit flesh, to tease a nipple and watch with fascination as it grew larger, as the aereola expanded wide around it and as it grew erect in a way it never could before.  His chest was now a scandalous, erotic sight, which it had never been before.  If he went to the beach, decency would from now on demand that he cover this...this prominent display of his increasingly feminine sexual nature.  Even covered, it would evoke lust in men.<br />
<br />
That last thought affected him in a way he didn&#39;t expect.  The thought of how men would react, how they would hunger to possess him, how his soft curves would cause their cocks to stiffen and grow, so...so big and...and so powerful, throbbing with need and pulsing with veins, eager to dump their loads inside of him...god, his mind was shifting so fast he could scarcely complete a thought before it became radically lustful in a feminine way.  Despite his penchant for submission, he&#39;d never had a gay thought before and had found dicks gross, but now the conjured image of a big uncut dick in his head was absolutely beautiful.  He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it!  There it was in his head, a vision all-consuming of an angry pulsing rod, aching to take him, and despite all previous programming all he could think of was how badly he wanted to feel it inside of him.<br />
<br />
One of the watching tendrils approached, holding...a dildo?  It must have conjured it up somehow, but it didn&#39;t force it upon him, simply offering it to his hand delicately, as if to say &quot;Here, my lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
He should have stopped long ago, if he wanted to keep his male identity, but there was no turning back now.  He wanted this too much. His efforts at self deception suggesting that he didn&#39;t were growing increasingly fragile. So he reached a shaking hand out and grabbed the penis-shaped instrument, and before he could doubt himself he&#39;d plunged it inside.  Frightening though the prospect may be, he didn&#39;t hesitate to imagine that it was a real cock, that he was losing his virginity to a man.  The thought created a new level of pleasure, and with it a new wave of changes.  He watched his waist cave in and his hips expand until he had a seductive hourglass shape, watched his thighs expand.  Oh my.  He was going to be &quot;thicc&quot;, it seemed, and as he felt a stunning amount of cushioning develop underneath him, he realized he&#39;d just acquired an ass that would make men howl with lust.  He imagined himself sashaying down the street in tight jeans, drawing the eye of everyone he passed. To his own shock he didn&#39;t hesitate to imagine himself bending over to show that ass off, and then before he knew it that fantasy had shifted to include a man lifting up his dress and pulling down his panties to get a better view, and he knew the view was stunning.  As his he began to work up a frantic pace with the dildo, the fantasy shifted again without his conscious will, and in it the man suddenly slapped a huge dick on the ass that had been offered to it. He was helpless before his lust now, and as the man in the fantasy rubbed his cock back and forth between Lorenzo&#39;s ass cheeks, making him feel so sexy and desirable and gorgeous, his wail of need was the loudest in the auditorium.  &quot;What a dirty girl you are.&quot; Said his fantasy lover, and Lorenzo knew that it was true.  Somehow this fantasy of letting a man get himself off with his ass, this submissive position he imagined himself in, felt even more confirming of his, nay, her new identity than the vaginal fantasy had been.  She knew she couldn&#39;t call herself a man anymore, not when she wanted something like this.  Not when she was imagining him working his cock back and forth between her ass cheeks, and the idea of his pleasure excited her more than her own, and certainly not when she imagined him roar as he splurted his come all over her ass and back, marking her as his, and that fantasy catapulted her to her own world-changing orgasm.  She let it take her, and cried out her womanhood to the world as it did.<br />
<br />
When she&#39;d caught her breath, the tendrils lifted her to her feet, and one of them gestured to the lewd scene before her, new males taking new females, whether they wanted it or not, and as she watched she saw them come to want it more.  As the first couple finished she saw the new adoration as the conquered looked at her conqueror, and Lorenzo realized that the new girl had become his slave.<br />
<br />
So she wasn&#39;t done yet.  She still had more to lose.  Perhaps if she&#39;d been in a better state of mind, she would have fought against it now, but the sexual charge that vibrated through her entire being now was too much, and of course it was all inevitable anyway.  So she knew she was going to march right up to a male and let him have her.  The only difference between her and the rest of the girls would be that she could choose her master.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she let out an &quot;Eep!&quot; as she felt a slap on her perfect ass.  It was a tendril, as if it say &quot;Get to it, girl.&quot;  So she stepped forward, but who to choose?</p>
