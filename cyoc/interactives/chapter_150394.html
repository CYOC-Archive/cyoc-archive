<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terrence only had a week before he changed, so he had to make sure he was acted quickly. As he had ordered Anne, the doctors and scientists he had hired were already at work for a cure. However her none of them knew of his condition save for one, a Doctor Cylain, a woman he had once dated and shared his disdain of the virus. She would essentially be his bedside doctor.<br />
<br />
At Anne bequest, he had re worded a video of himself as he was explaining the situation, just in case the worst happened. However Terrence was determined to not let that happen.<br />
<br />
Wednesday<br />
<br />
No progress had been made on the cure.<br />
<br />
However Terrence was changing. Cylain had informed that his ears had moved up slightly from their normal position on his head, and he had a small stub just above his ass. He was obviously growing a tail.<br />
<br />
However, what was more distressing was when he informed her that his nipples felt sensitive under the shirt he was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do?&quot; she asked, with a frown.<br />
<br />
Terrence nodded. &quot;Is that bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
She did her best to hide her worry. &quot;It could be nothing,&quot; she muttered, sounding as if she was trying to convince herself as much as him.<br />
<br />
Thursday<br />
<br />
Still no progress towards a cure.<br />
<br />
He woke up that day to find that most of his body hair had fallen out, leaving his white skin smooth. Stranger yet, his hair had turned into a pure white color and had seemingly grown a little longer, reaching up to his shoulder.<br />
<br />
When he asked Cylain about this, she did her best not to meet his gaze and quickly left his house.<br />
<br />
It was worrying, but not as worrying as when he found out, later that night, that his penis had grown smaller.<br />
<br />
Friday<br />
<br />
Still no progress on a cure.<br />
<br />
That day confirmed his worst fears.<br />
<br />
Terrence was turning into a girl.<br />
<br />
His dick was now half the size it used to be and small breast buds had formed on his chest. His entire body looked the slightest bit curvier and he lost a bit of the muscle he had worked hard for. He had worked on them for 40+ years. <br />
<br />
Terrence&#39;s ears were closer to the top of his forehead and seemingly growing a little pointier and some of his white hair was now growing into them. The small flesh stub on his back had grown longer and split off into nine different points. His hair had grown longer, now reaching down halfway across his back. <br />
<br />
Cylain couldn&#39;t figure out what he was turning into. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should I cut my hair?&quot; he asked, reaching for the scissors. <br />
<br />
Cylain stopped him. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; she warned. &quot;We don&#39;t know what you&#39;re turning into. There was a time when doctors cut the hair off of a transformee and they felt the pain of it being cut off like it was an arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrence stayed away from scissors after that.<br />
<br />
Friday<br />
<br />
Still no progress on a cure.<br />
<br />
His breasts had grown larger and his dick smaller. In fact he strangely looked about 20 years younger than he used to be. He had just turned 45 that year, but now he felt as though he could pass as someone as young as Anne, who was 25. <br />
<br />
His ears had full migrated to the top of his head and now looked a little goofy, but they were still changing. They were frowning pointier and hair was growing over them, though this hair was a light orange color. He could still hear just fine thankfully. His nose also seemed to be turning smaller, and a couple of hairs poked out from either side of it.<br />
<br />
His tail or tails had grown longer making it hard for him to sleep on his back. They were also growing that light orange hair or fur, as Cylain called.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re turning in not some sort of half animal,&quot; she muttered. &quot;And a female, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me the cure&#39;s or any process to reverse this has been discovered,&quot; he begged, as his voice cracked slightly going an octave higher.<br />
<br />
Cylain winced. &quot;We&#39;re still working.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saturday<br />
<br />
Still no progress on the cure.<br />
<br />
There weren&#39;t a whole lot of changes. Though Cylain did confirm what he was turning into. &quot;A kitsune,&quot; she told him. &quot;It&#39;s a sort of Japanese mythical monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrence gritted his teeth. &quot;That doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; he said, his voice now a full octave higher. &quot;Tell me we&#39;ve found a way to fix this.&quot; His body was now unrecognizable to him. His face was changing so now he looked like he was of Asian descent. He was growing whiskers and his nose had turned into a small snout, reminding him of a fox. Which made sense.<br />
<br />
Cylain looked. &quot;Just give us some time,&quot; she insisted.<br />
<br />
Sunday<br />
<br />
Still no progress.<br />
<br />
His ears were growing larger and more tipped. He found that if he concentrated he could manipulate them slightly. His tails were also frowning longer and the same colored fur was spreading alongside them.<br />
<br />
His breasts had grown a little larger and his dick a little smaller, resembling the size a mere child would have. He could see that his fingernails and toenails were growing a little longer.<br />
<br />
Cylain didn&#39;t even bother coming that day.<br />
<br />
Monday<br />
<br />
No progress.<br />
<br />
Anne informed Terrence that Cylain had quit, but she was currently tracking her down to file a lawsuit. She then hesitatingly asked how he was doing, but he hung up at that point.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror. His ears had turned into full fox ears. They were large with a little bit of white fur pointing out from inside. Surprisingly, he found that he could hear a lot better. If he concentrated he could hear some of the cars driving down the closest street, when he normally couldn&#39;t. His nine tails had also grown larger, about the size of his arms and didn&#39;t seem to be done growing. <br />
<br />
His dick was now nothing more than a stub. The last holdout from his manhood and humanity. <br />
<br />
Tuesday<br />
<br />
It was over. <br />
<br />
He asked Anne to fire the scientists and doctors they had hired through an email. Thankfully she didn&#39;t ask how he was feeling only promising to come by later. He was now staring at his naked body through the mirror.<br />
<br />
He had googled pictures of kitsune online and found that he looked similar to artistic interpretations, if a little more foxlike in the face. <br />
<br />
It looked like his ethnicity had changed to that of Japanese, which made sense given this was  a Japanese monster. His nose had turned smaller and looked more like the end of a fox&#39;s snout with three whiskers flanking both sides of his nose. His hair had turned a silvery white and was now hanging about three quarters down his back. Strangely the shape of his eyebrows had changed, turning a lot more rounded and matching his hair color. His breasts were huge and everytime he walked he could feel them bounce. Terrence estimated that he was a size of DD but he wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
His form had gotten a lot curvier making him look like quite the bombshell. He had also grown a little taller. He had a flat stomach, a rounder ass, and an hourglass shape that would make some of his past dates a little jealous. His fingernails and toenails had grown into points to make them look like claws. <br />
<br />
The ears on the top of his head were about twice the size of his old one and he found that he could manipulate them through thought alone. Of course those were nothing compared to his nine tails, which all had light orange fur with white fur at the tips. They were long. From the point they started from just above his butt, they could reach all the way to a point a little higher than his head. Of course now, they were dropping, the points of them pointed to the floor as he gazed at the final change he had been dreading.<br />
<br />
His penis was now gone, leaving only a small slit in its place. A small patch of silver public hair was positioned right above.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, a whole bunch of emotions welled up inside Terrence and he hugged himself, falling to his knees. He was heard slightly sobbing. <br />
<br />
He had failed.</p>
