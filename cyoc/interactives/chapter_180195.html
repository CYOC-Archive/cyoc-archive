<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan felt a sense of conflict inside of himself that he had not felt since the initial time it seemed Ross left their friend group. He wanted to find Wes and figure out what was going on with him, maybe more, but he stumbled into a bathroom to just &quot;clear things up&quot; and &quot;get his head in gear.&quot; Bryan saw his somewhat tanned up body, standing there, his hair seeming to be slightly curled at the edges, and he groaned. He didn&#39;t even know what he wanted any more. If he thought that the wish was going to make everything easier, this definitely put the kibosh to that.<br />
<br />
He gripped the edges of the sink, looking at himself. He had gotten this wish done in order to get girlfriends for him and Wes. But now things seemed so different from how they were before. More changes than he anticipated. He breathed - thinking back to that gay hook-up he just had. He had indulged with Ross and Diego like...like he had really wanted that. And honestly? He had. He couldn&#39;t even deny that it had felt good, and now he was suddenly so tempted, so curious, to see about doing that again.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Why the fuck didn&#39;t I go back to the festival?&quot; Bryan murmured to himself, and suddenly slapped himself over the head, &quot;I&#39;m straight! I&#39;m straight! C&#39;mon, Bryan, you&#39;re not...you&#39;re...you&#39;re...&quot; He tried to tell himself he had just moved in because his &quot;jock libido&quot; was acting up. Maybe...maybe he needed to get it outta his system more. Or maybe that was an excuse he was telling himself. But at any rate, he wasn&#39;t going to allow the wish to totally shape how he was gonna be.<br />
<br />
Even if he was gonna try for Wes as his renewed curiosity and desire wanted, Bryan decided he was gonna try for those women again. He was still basically Bryan deep down, and he wasn&#39;t gonna be anything but. Maybe he could still use this. Somehow. But Bryan still knew as he looked around he was going to need to find Wes.<br />
<br />
For one reason or another.<br />
<br />
Wes was likely going through the same things he was. And honestly, he wondered how his best friend was going to take it all. Wes was more mellow, less aggressive. He was chill, and Bryan didn&#39;t know how that might be interacting with all of this. &quot;Gotta find my bro Wes...&quot; <br />
<br />
Wes...Bryan had to make sure that Wes wasn&#39;t going through something like that. Maybe they could find their way back to the festival. Take care of this. Just...enjoy their time together in a total het way. Bryan had gotten an orgasm out of his system. He could handle himself now. Just like yesterday. Right?<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Wes meanwhile was doing his own third period task - whereas Bryan had study hall, Wes had something of a job he had to do. He was a front office assistant, running all over the campus delivering referrals, notices, and other sorts of things. Wes dabbed at his forehead with his shirt, noting how tight the fabric was getting to be against his body. He grinned a little at himself and minded his reflection in a nearby window. He could see a powerfully muscled, thick bodied stud. He had really taken in Bryan&#39;s &quot;plan&quot;, and while Bryan hadn&#39;t really noticed, Wes had been the recipient of quite a lot of notice during class.<br />
<br />
He remembered grinning a little bit to himself as he noted some girls chatting about whether or not Bryan and Wes were gay or not, and how much that delighted him when they said how hot it&#39;d be to watch Bryan and Wes go at it. Or even join in. Wes had never really been noticed like that before, so even with such a fetishistic lens to it, he was pretty delighted by the attention.<br />
<br />
As Wes made a referral delivery across the campus, he found himself passing by some restrooms out by the now not in use soccer field. He folded his referral under his arm when he saw a young woman standing out by the woman&#39;s locker room. She was somewhat cold looking, tall and athletic, seeming to be standing out there waiting. Her hair was light blond and she had a slight tan to her, her eyes cold and light blue. She had been one of the women who hadn&#39;t so easily aired her opinions about the Wes and Bryan potential affair. In fact, despite being easily as attractive as the cheerleaders, she seemed more content to loiter and fuck around at parties.<br />
<br />
Wes found himself walking over, curious to see what was going on here.<br />
<br />
By now, she was noticing his approach, and openly addressed him, chuckling a little, &quot;Just between us, I agreed to watch out while my friend was in there lighting up. I think she might be just laying in there a smoked up mess.&quot; She bitterly chuckled, and then looked at Wes, &quot;Front desk man, eh? Where&#39;s your boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not my boyfriend.&quot; Wes responded pretty quickly, still adhering to the plan - or at least telling himself he did. &quot;We&#39;re just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In that phase of the friendship where you touch each others&#39; arms like that. Face it. You two were about to make out.&quot; She remarked. She seemed to realize something, &quot;By the by, my name&#39;s Cheryl. How about you, big boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Wes. And what makes you think we were gonna make out. I&#39;m straight, he&#39;s straight.&quot; Wes stated, crossing his arms. As much as she was inciting him to argue, he did admit that she was smoking hot. The kind of hot that delinquent girls like her frequently ended up being. Tough, sexy and roguish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Sure.&quot; Cheryl said with a chuckle, and then looked at Wes&#39; body, &quot;Well, whatever game you two are playing, you&#39;ve got a lot of the girls here pretty stoked about potentially joining in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how about you?&quot; Wes answered, grinning a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Well, honestly, I think you&#39;re a hot jock fucker, and honestly, pretty much exactly my type.&quot; Cheryl answered in a very forward manner. She looked at Wes from heel to face, &quot;Puppy-eyed, trying to be confident, buff as fuck, but pretty innocent...&quot; She leaned forward and teased Wes a little bit with a slight look at her bosom, &quot;Am I wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes looked around to check if there were any teachers around there. He saw none. So he felt much more keenly ready to react to Cheryl&#39;s heavy flirtation. &quot;You think I&#39;m innocent? Me, being this huge? Playing it this way?&quot; Wes promptly groped his own groin with his left arm and flexed his right.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we deal with a bit of that innocence then. Or you just show me you&#39;re not so puppy-eyed.&quot; Cheryl moved forward and grabbed Wes&#39; collar, pulling him over. She was pretty strong for a girl, and Wes was pretty surprised...but not too surprised to forget to make his own move.<br />
<br />
Suddenly switching their position with a grab at her shoulder and hip, Wes grinded her back against the wall of the bathroom area. So far away, and so few people came out here this time of day... &quot;Maybe I&#39;m a big, tough jock now. I mean, I got the muscles for it. Maybe I&#39;m down to finally start sexually asserting myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was evidently very into that, and Cheryl promptly roughly kissed Wes right on the lips, their wrestling / make out session promptly turning full on into a make out. Wes grinded his hips against her groin, feeling his manhood stirring into action...<br />
<br />
Then he felt her grab and pinch at his butt. Wes suppressed a surprisingly sexed up moan at the feeling, not wanting to come off badly in front of Cheryl like that. But the fact he quivered and thrust his hips did not go unnoticed by her. Cheryl grinned and kept kneading his ass, finally winning out and getting a succession of gasps and moans from Wes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, does the big man have a big, sensitive ass?&quot; Cheryl really seemed to enjoy teasing at his hole, pushing his shorts down and pressing her finger against the seat of his boxers, hitting his asshole and making Wes&#39; cock pulse.<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK! You&#39;re turning me on way too much...let&#39;s...let&#39;s fuckin&#39; do this!&quot; Before long Wes picked her up and carried her in his big strong arms past the bathroom area, to the side. She moaned and kissed at his neck as he did this, transparently enjoying it despite digging her fingers into him and even roughly pinching his nipple through his shirt - which just made Wes let out a loud gasp of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Cheryl pulled her own pants and panties down and opened the way. &quot;Take me rough, you buff fucker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wes obliged her, and pinned her up against the building. Slipping his cock into her - noting as he did that it was curiously a little more brown than usual - he started thrusting away. Pistoning his hips into her, feeling her tight inner muscles - and feeling her really try to tighten up and make this either more difficult or more satisfying for Wes. &quot;Fuck babe you&#39;re tight!&quot; Wes kept thrusting anyway, and felt his cock was just about as hard as it could get.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it to me, fucker!&quot; Cheryl moaned in his ear, pressing her nails against his shoulders with one hand and using the other to roughly grip one globe of his ass in the other. Fuck he was so wide. Cheryl could barely believe it. She felt him starting to pulse, &quot;You gonna cum!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah I&#39;m gonna...gonna cum!&quot; Wes tried to pull out...only for Cheryl to move her hand and grip his ass with both hands, pressing two of her fingers into his needy hole. Where Bryan had already---!! <br />
<br />
&quot;FUUUUUUUUCK!! You made me fucking cum inside!&quot; Wes came thunderously - and Cheryl outright let out almost a scream of pleasure as she responded to his orgasm with her own. Wes stood there for a moment after it was all over, covered in sweat as he stood there on two uneasy feet. His manhood quivering as he backed up out of Cheryl. She let her hands fall on to the sides of the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...was something else, big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big man, you mean.&quot; Wes said with a smile in between heavy breaths. Cheryl promptly punched his left shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have got to do that again.&quot; She said, and Wes was left wondering if she was gonna get that opportunity. He got dressed again shortly after, and watched her do the same, going back to where she had stood, watching out for her by now probably high as a kite friend.<br />
<br />
Wes started to look around, hopefully no teachers had seen what he just got up to...but what he did end up seeing was significantly more awkward. Standing by the side of the building, having went over and seen the last bits of that, was none other than Bryan. He had a rock hard erection in his jeans, and he was trying evidently to avoid taking it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Wes asked uneasily in a hushed tone, &quot;How much of that did you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...the last bits. I didn&#39;t know what I was looking at. I walked over and---&quot; Bryan whispered.<br />
<br />
Before long, the two of them walked off from the area once the bell rang. The fourth period was one they had together, and both Wes and Bryan looked at one another with an uneasy expression. Wes knew Bryan had seen that, yet the guy didn&#39;t seem nearly as envious as before, when Wes had gotten all that attention earlier. <br />
<br />
Bryan on the other hand had been utterly stoked he got to see that side of Wes. Seeing him fuck like that was like something out of his newly formed fantasies. It was beyond his expectations. He didn&#39;t even know right now if he wanted to be the one fucking Wes next time, or if he wanted to join in for menage a trois. Bryan gulped, not knowing what they were gonna do next.</p>
