<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny snuggled closer to John as they laid in the hammock. John smiled as she gently laid her head across his orc chest, directly over his heart. “I am so glad to be out of that dungeon,” she said quietly.<br />
<br />
“Me too,” he whispered, kissing her. “But I have to ask, if you can do magic, how come you couldn’t get out of that cell?”<br />
<br />
Jenny chuckled. “I’ve barely got any skill for magic. Truth be told, I could only do that augmentation spell because Daniels had conjured that rope and it had latent magic I was able to work with.”<br />
<br />
“Is that right. Wait, ‘Daniels?’ That’s the satyr’s name?”<br />
<br />
“Er,” Jenny paused. “Yes,” she said reluctantly. The satyr had a human name. Was he originally born human?<br />
<br />
Jenny quickly changed the subject. “Yes, we, the Royal Elves of Eleanoris, have varying abilities of magic. I’m most definitely a novice. But what about you? You were a dragon when I first met you!” Jenny paused, as John tried to find some words. “You’re not really an orc, are you,” she deduced.<br />
<br />
The phrase “not really an orc” bounced around in John’s mind for a while. Not sure what to say, he was silent for a few seconds. “Before I answer that, can you do me a favor?” he finally asked, quietly.<br />
<br />
“Name it,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Can you use whatever magic you have to make these pants a bit bigger? Because…” Jenny glanced down at John’s torso. She quickly looked away after a glimpse of John’s orchood poking out of the crude loincloth he was wearing. The close contact with Jenny was making it stand at attention. “I mean, I know you’ve seen it already, but I don’t want anyone else to. This show ain’t free.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll...I’ll see what I can do,” Jenny said, embarrassed. “I seem to have the best luck with natural things like this cloth.” She took hold of John’s garment and closed her eyes. After a few seconds, it began to glow.<br />
<br />
“Ooh! Hey, it tickles!” John said, squirming. The cloth John was wearing stretched down his body, inching towards his knees, then his ankles. It then stretched at its top, contouring to John’s rear end and waist. Jenny let go and relaxed. John felt the new pair of pants he was now wearing. Tight, but not so John couldn’t get them off. They were like a comfy pair of sweatpants; they even did a nice job covering his bulge and his thick ass. “You’re too modest, princess. This is fantastic.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” she said, panting. “Really takes a lot out of a girl.”<br />
<br />
John decided to come clean, at least partially. He would be giving Jenny a heavily sanitized version. “You’re right, your highness. I am not an orc, I was trapped in this form by the satyr we’re so familiar with.”<br />
<br />
“That’s terrible. How long ago did this happen?”<br />
<br />
“A few days ago. Last night I fell asleep and woke up in the dungeon we were trapped in.”<br />
<br />
“How did you become the dragon?”<br />
<br />
John blushed. Well, princess, I became a dragon when a dwarf sucked me off and I blew my load into his stomach, he thought. He decided against giving the true reason. “Um, somehow I was able to use the satyr’s curse on me to reshape my form. But then I guess it wore off and went back to this orc form.”<br />
<br />
Jenny snuggled in and felt John’s muscles once again. “I guess it’s not so bad. Especially considering what you have down here,” she said seductively, moving her hand down towards John’s crotch.<br />
<br />
John shivered and placed one of his thick arms around Jenny. “I don’t suppose you have any magic to help yourself accommodate that?”<br />
<br />
“Not on your life.”<br />
<br />
“Dang.”<br />
<br />
Jenny giggled. “I’m as disappointed as you are. John, I’ve only known you a short time, but you are more kind, thoughtful, and eloquent than any elf I’ve ever known, nevermind orc.”<br />
<br />
“What can I say? I have the best of both worlds. I kill satyrs by day, I’m a sensitive beast by night.” John paused. A whole bunch of gushy words were about to spill out, and he was hopeless to stop them. “One that is in love with you and doesn’t want to lose you.”<br />
<br />
Jenny was quiet for some time. “If only you weren’t in the form of an orc, it could work.” she said with a yawn.<br />
<br />
“There must be some magic that can break this curse on me.” The two were quiet as John thought hard. “Do you know of any way that can happen? Is there a wizard nearby? One that’s orc-friendly?”<br />
<br />
Jenny didn’t respond. Shortly later she started snoring. John frowned, but he soon nodded off as well.<br />
<br />
The orc and princess stirred as the rising sun hit their eyelids. John gave Jenny a gentle squeeze. “Good morning,” he muttered.<br />
<br />
“Good morning, orc breath,” she said with a grimace.<br />
<br />
“Sorry. I guess you have to get going, the sun’s coming up.” John said sadly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m sure Kaecinus will want to go soon. I’ll miss you. Listen, you saved my life. I will make sure the right people know that. I will do whatever I can to see you again. My father is the king, I’ll have him suspend the orc decree.”<br />
<br />
“You think he would do that?”<br />
<br />
Jenny paused. “Maybe.” John sighed dejectedly when she said that word. “Maybe is the best I can do. My father’s strong-willed. I suppose all kings are.” Jenny kissed John’s side. “Do you have a goodbye present for me?”<br />
<br />
John smirked and slowly moved his green arm over the top of Jenny and reached for her breasts. Jenny swatted his hand away. “Guess again,” she said.<br />
<br />
John was still falling in love with Jenny, but man, was she a tease. “What did you want, then?”<br />
<br />
“A love poem.”<br />
<br />
“A wha--?”<br />
<br />
“You said you were a sophisticated man. The male elves of my father’s kingdom regularly profess their love to their lovers through poetry. I said you were more eloquent than any elf I knew, so I want to hear what you have for me.”<br />
<br />
“I...I don’t…” With a scantily-clad beautiful woman in front of him, at the time, John couldn’t even come up with a knock-knock joke, let alone a poem.<br />
<br />
“Come on. If you’re really in love with me, the words will come.” Jenny goaded him.<br />
<br />
John frowned. “You’re serious?”<br />
<br />
“Quite.”<br />
<br />
The orc shook his massive head. “All right,” he said. He slowly formed an idea. Clearing his throat, he began.<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s a lady who&#39;s sure all that glitters is gold<br />
And she&#39;s buying a stairway to heaven<br />
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed<br />
With a word she can get what she came for<br />
And she&#39;s buying a stairway to heaven.”<br />
<br />
Jenny’s eyes went wide as John recited. He smirked, thinking she must have been impressed, and continued with his performance. It was, of course, completely plagiarized from Stairway to Heaven, but John didn’t think he had to worry about being caught.<br />
<br />
John went through a few bars and “That was...lovely, John.” Her voice was strangely flat.<br />
<br />
The orc planted a kiss on Jenny. “You liked it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she said. “But I do prefer Led Zeppelin’s earlier work. Stairway is so overdone.”<br />
<br />
John bolted upright in shock, shifting the balance of the hammock and causing it to flip, sending the pair to the dusty earth.</p>
