<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Toby pulled his shirt off, quickly kicked off his shoes, and dropped his jeans. He pulled off his socks and stood in his boxers. At first he told himself he was just going to change to lift, but the loincloth kept calling out to him. He had to try it on.<br />
<br />
He dropped his boxers, got completely naked, and set his clothing into his locker. The beckoning was stronger than ever now, and as he pulled out the loincloth he could almost feel it talking to him, &quot;yes Toby,&quot; he said, &quot;put it on, you need it, we need each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was just then that he heard the locker door open. A few of his old bros were heading back in from lifting. &quot;Nice lift, dude&quot; one said, he sounded like Chris, a running back. &quot;Yeah bro, it was good.&quot; The other said, it sounded like Brett.<br />
<br />
Toby dropped the loincloth by accident, but before he could pick it up he noticed it take off like a life of its own! It moved a foot or two away from him before heading back to Toby, wrapping itself around his feet and ankles, untying itself to grasp around his feet before tying itself back together and working its way up his shins. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; Toby exclaimed!<br />
<br />
The other guys could hear him. &quot;Toby is that you?&quot; Brett asked, &quot;what is he doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need me, Toby&quot; the cloth said, speaking directly into his mind. &quot;We must merge.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the cloth worked its way up Toby&#39;s naked thighs, Toby knew he was helpless ot its power. It was a vessel and it needed a host, Toby was about to become it. As it inched closer to his crotch Toby could feel the powers it held, the abilities he was to gain. His excitement and aggression started to build again as it creeped up his body. He turned around to see Brett and Chris staring at him in bewilderment. &quot;Guys what the fuck is happening to me?!&quot; he said just as the loincloth settled over his skinny butt-cheeks and folded over his crotch, his dick growing with excitement. The cloth clamped over his erected penis and tightened against his body, molding itself to fit perfectly over its new host.<br />
<br />
It was then that Toby began to understand. This was the loincloth of an ancient and all-powerful god. It was waiting in hibernation for a human to bond with. This god was going to give him its powers, and he in turn would share his consciousness with it. The excitement was unbearable. He could feel its powers pushing outward from the cloth, into his loins, through is dick and ass, and upward and into his body.<br />
<br />
With it came an explosion of muscle. His ass pushed outward into an athletic butt and as his dick and balls grew with sheer force, pushing its contours through the loincloth. Then the muscle spread down to his quads, his legs bulking stronger than even the most fit athletes on the team. His knees expanded outward as his shins grew upward and the muscles locked in. He could feel his feet elongating as well as a new masculine wave of hair grew upward from his legs back up toward his pubes, then over his belly button and toward his chest. As it was doing so, the powers grew his abs outward into a thick, well-defined six pack, his pecs grew outward and flattened as his neck and shoulders broadened and thickened. With a new level of assertion and control, Toby flexed his arms as hair grew outward from his pits, down his forearms and toward his hands. his biceps curled outward as new, thick lines of sinew emerged.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Toby shouted with aggression. &quot;This power, it&#39;s mine! HAHA&quot; he shouted as he felt his face chisel out and more muscle grow over him. His dick regrew his foreskin like a classic god as he felt his seed change from his own sperm to that of an all-powerful god. <br />
<br />
It was then that he felt the wave of pure, unbridled powers emerge from his body. He was losing his flesh, his humanity, all that made him an immortal. The powers were shifting his body into pure vessels of an immortal god, one of pure and relinquished power. &quot;YES YES!&quot; he shouted again. &quot;How do you like me now, boys?!&quot; he shouted as he felt the confidence and personality of the ancient god wrap into his mind, becoming one with him. <br />
<br />
It was then that the loincloth literally snapped and folded itself into Toby&#39;s body, truly becoming one with the now-transformed god. The gods were either naked or in their loincloths, Toby felt it necessary to expose himself in all his godly glory. <br />
<br />
Streaks of lightening and power enveloped Toby as his transformation ended, a new god full of unbridled powers. He looked to his teammates, his dick and balls locked and horny. What was he to do now?</p>
