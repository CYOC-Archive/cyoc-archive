<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[Hey Lucy, what&#39;s up?] Mantis called with newfound enthusiasm<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[We ain&#39;t got time to fuck around talking Mantis, were on the clock with this one, while gang&#39;s mobilizing, we just picked up our biggest pay day yet]<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[How so, who&#39;s the target?] Antonio was interested now, the crews biggest score?, after his last payout he could only imagine who they were after, looking over at Mantis as they waited for the elevator doors to open, he had to help her however he could<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Not a who this time pretty boy, a what and where] this made both Mantis and Antonio a bit surprised, especially since as far as he knew, Lucy&#39;s crew had only taken targets from a person<br />
[Going down road C112-D now, target is a Kovastov smugglers truck, Military grade]<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Lucy you can&#39;t be fucking serious, you don&#39;t mess with Kovastov, he don&#39;t take shit from anyone, how the fuck are we gonna pull this off?!] Antonio watched as she began to panic slightly, her fists clenching until the elevator doors opened on the sub level garage<br />
[Lucy why the fuck are we tangling with Kovastov, we stay on our side of the tracks and he stays on his, makes good business all around, just what the fuck is in that truck?]<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care, all I know is that I&#39;ve got a buyer in the top lanes that&#39;s got deep pockets to get whatever shit is in that truck] Lucy sure had a way of putting things bluntly<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[We&#39;ll be there in 5 minutes] Mantis said with a hint of frustration as they both got into her car, the engine roaring to life and the screen coming alive to display the outside world<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[You got 4] was all the reply Lucy gave before cutting the call<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK!&quot; Mantis smashed her hands against the wheel before flooring the gas and came rocketing up the ramp to the carpark and onto the street, the tyres screeching in protest as they slid against the tarmac before gaining traction and began accelerating down the stretch of road at high speed<br />
&quot;God fucking dam it, it&#39;s one thing to go after people, but an armoured truck?!, she&#39;s lost her fucking mind&quot;<br />
<br />
Antonio looked at her confused, all conference from the day before seemed to melt away now, replaced by fear and anger, hesitantly he placed his hand on her shoulder, feeling her cyber muscles tense for a moment before relaxing<br />
&quot;Hey, c&#39;mon if anyone can pull it off it&#39;s us right?&quot; He said with enthusiasm, he had to try something to get her out of this headspace.<br />
She just looked at him and sighed<br />
&quot;I honestly have no idea, you don&#39;t understand your not familiar with the city like I am, no one and I mean NO ONE, messes with Kovastov&#39;s business, the ritch snob is the real deal, you get in his way and he flattens you on the spot&quot;<br />
Her grip clenched around the wheel before turning sharply again, her eyes now focused on the road seeing signs fly buy, the car barely missing other vehicles as they weaved through traffic.<br />
<br />
Before Antonio could press her for more information the heavy roar of other cars rumbled, looking behind them in the dashboards camera he saw several other cars barrel towards them, three small rally looking cars, all encased with roll cages and winches, all mat black with no windows at all, one large flat bed truck, it&#39;s suspension keeping it high off the ground, one motorcycle with a very familiar rider on the red two wheeler, it was Mia, recognizing her red jacket and the traces of purple hair under the red helmet, and finally a sleek and low looking sports car, silver with a neon green and purple stripe on its left side, running hood to fender on the bodywork.<br />
<br />
[Hey nice of you to join us] came Mia&#39;s voice, still as chipper as ever<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[It&#39;s about fucking time, targets on the move we got one shot at this let&#39;s go]<br />
<br />
Mantis and Antonio didn&#39;t even have time to respond before the line cut again, her hand clenching into a fist before shifting gears and sped up to keep pace with the crew, the silence was torture, everyone was on edge, no one knew what to expect.<br />
At long last the truck came into view, just leaving the city limits, without saying a word the three black cars sped up towards the truck, each ones engine being put to the test, this truck was fast, until at long last they appeared to be in position.<br />
Without warning a loud bang was heard, three harpoons connected by wires now anchoring the cars to the back end of the truck, then in perfect synchronisation all three hit the brakes, all stopping dead.<br />
<br />
The ear splitting sound of metal being torn from metal rang out before a massive bang, Mantis and Antonio watching in horrified awe as the trucks back doors came flying off, tumbling into the dirt by the roads wayside, Mantis frantically trying to avoid the cars and any debri as the truck accelerated, the now open back end pulling away with haste.<br />
<br />
[Ok echo your up, slow this fucker down] Lucy demanded, Antonio watching as the large flat bed began to take the lead on them before it sped up to race In Front of the truck<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[On it Lucy] came an unfamiliar male voice, his toan gruff and serious<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Ok ladies looks like our big score is gonna be easier than I-] <br />
<br />
&quot;OH SHIT!&quot; Antonio yelled as either side of the truck opened up to reveal it lined with what looked to be military grade weaponry, rapid fire weaponry, not waisting a moment the left side opened fire, the same side that echo had driven up to slow the truck was now getting pepper dashed with bullets<br />
<br />
[Hold on Echo I&#39;m on the way] came Mia&#39;s voice as the red motorcycle raced past<br />
<br />
Antonio didn&#39;t even have time to warn her before the trucks tyres blew out sending the flatbed turned on its side in a flash before rolling smack into Mia, the gas compartment of the truck instantly combusting sending the wreck up in flames like a tinderbox.<br />
<br />
Mantis and Antonio couldn&#39;t speak, the communication system was silent, only static, the car began to loose speed as the shock set in, one moment everything was going great, then the next, complete and utter disaster<br />
&quot;N-no, no fucking way&quot; Mantis whispered, her eyes glassy and wide as she held the wheel, before looking over at Antonio, staring into his eyes as if searching for something, until finally her eyes whent back to the road<br />
&quot;We&#39;re finding out what&#39;s in that truck, and we&#39;re taking it for ourselves&quot; she said, newfound determination in her voice<br />
&quot;What the fuck happened to no one messes with Kovastov?&quot; Antonio breathed, now looking at her with shock in his eyes, then he watched as her eyes narrowed<br />
&quot;That was before his business just took the lives of my friends&quot; she said in an angry flat voice<br />
&quot;You with me?&quot; She said, now looking Antonio dead in the eye, looking for his answer<br />
He nodded in agreement<br />
&quot;After this, we&#39;re done with this crew, together, we do things by our own rules from now on&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah&quot; Mantis grinned, leaning across to kiss him before punching the gas pedal, gunning straight for the back end of the truck, Antonio then got an idea, a crazy but altogether good idea, rolling down his window he slid so he was sitting on the door, grabbing hold of the roofs bars to keep stable<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; Mantis said, genuinely seeming worried about him.<br />
Antonio grinned at her &quot;awww you do care, just thought I&#39;d get some fresh air, be back in a sec&quot; giving her a salute before letting himself to the mercy of gravity and the road.<br />
<br />
[SYSTEM: Bioplastic blood vessels]<br />
[ENGAGED]<br />
[SUBSYSTEM: Kerensikov MK3]<br />
<br />
In an instant time crawled to a slow, to keep pace with the truck now all Antonio needed to do was lightly jog, hopping up into the back of the armored truck, Antonio was surprised to see it empty, apart from one crate, chained down tight at the center.<br />
&quot;Hmmmm all this trouble and defense for a box, let&#39;s just take a peak&quot;<br />
Effortlessly snapping the lock Antonio yanked the lid free and stoped dead at what he saw.<br />
It was a girl, a young girl, more CYBERNETIC implant than human, the entire bottom half of her face missing, her nose and mouth replaced by mechanical workings inside the metallic indent, her closed eyes moved as if in a dream like state,, her body was white as paper, no trace of skin apart from her left hand, and left leg, her entire body replaced with cybernetic implants, she had a small amount of hair in her left side, golden blonde, cut in a perfect line at the top of her head, swep to one side covering one side of her head and face<br />

<br />
Antonio was in disbelief, this girl was a living weapon, and a child to boot!, locked away in a box like a piece of equipment, like she wasn&#39;t even alive, and Lucy would have sold her to whoever payed her more, not as long as Antonio had a say,picking her up from the box he set her down against it, planning how he was going to get her out, the strain of using  his Kerensikov was already running him down, turning back around to pick up the girl Antonio was shocked to see her standing behind him, her eyes wide and curious, as if trying to make sense of who or what he was, but the more important thing that surprised him was the fact that she was moving, even going as far as to assume she was moving faster than himself.<br />
&quot;Hey there, what&#39;s your name?&quot; He asked in a gentle voice, there was no reply, she just continued to stare at him in wonder and curiosity<br />
&quot;Ok that&#39;s not working, where are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl took her eyes away from Antonio and pointed at the box, as if stating that&#39;s where she came from.<br />
&quot;Fuck I wasn&#39;t prepared for this, look I&#39;m gonna get you out of here ok?&quot; He asked, putting a hand on her shoulder and scooping her into his arms, however in a flash she was back at his side<br />
&quot;Ok that&#39;s a no as well, ummm, do you want to get out of here?&quot; The girl cocked her head to the side before she began walking out the back of the truck, hopping down and walking around, her head all over the place as if taking everything in<br />
&quot;Yeah not exactly pretty out here huh, but tell ya what, how about we make it so you never have to back in that box again how about that?&quot; Antonio said, hopping down from the truck as it slowly moved away.<br />
<br />
The girl turned with blazing speed to face him, her eyes still wide, but now seeming excited, as if offering her to never go back in the box was the best news of her life<br />
&quot;Ok then, no more box, you come with me and my partner there and we&#39;ll get you somewhere safe&quot; Antonio got onto one knee to get eye level with the girl, who shocked and panicked him by simply going limp, almost like she just shut off, her head going slack on her neck and now aimed straight at the floor, standing there motionless.<br />
&quot;Ok, not freaky at all&quot; he murmured before picking her up once again and getting back into Mantis&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
As soon as the car door shut behind them Antonios Cyberware finally gave out, time resuming to normal, the sounds and chaos of their situation crashing back into his senses in an instant<br />
&quot;Holy shit that was fa-&quot; Mantis stopped dead as she saw the girl, looking at Antonio then at the truck, then back to him, almost connecting the dots in her head, not asking any questions she grasped the wheel firm and spun the car around, the tyres crying out on the tarmac once more before gripping the rough road and raced away from the truck, passing Lucy and the remains of her crew in a flash as they raced back towards the city<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got alot to talk about when we get back&quot; was all she said as they raced back, before a massive explosion rattled them from behind, slamming on the breaks they both looked back to see the truck had self detonated, and the crews cars had smashed headlong into the inferno, they couldn&#39;t move, they couldn&#39;t speak, in one swoop the whole crew was gone, they were on their own now, what the fuck do they do from here.</p>
