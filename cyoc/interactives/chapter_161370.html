<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;He&#39;s waking up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, is he ever gonna love this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya think?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, who wouldn&#39;t want to look like that? He&#39;s gonna live every kid&#39;s dream. My son would kill to look like that going to school.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whaaaat,&quot; Andy grunted. His head. It felt so heavy. The fog was starting to wear off. He blinked. He was in a hospital room, a fairly nice one, with many flower arrangements surrounding his bed. &quot;Ugh. Am I in the hospital?&quot; he asked. His voice sounded like his throat had been scraping gravel, only it didn&#39;t hurt. His own voice RUMBLED in his ears when he talked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure are, kid. And you made out like a bandit, if you ask me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What...is that my voice? It sounds so weird.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It will take a while to get used to. Hi, I&#39;m Dr. Marcus. You&#39;re Andy Galar. Allow me to apologize. We were under a contract not to reveal to you the man who was chosen for your body swap. The reason for this is that the man whose body you are taking was working for your lawyer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My lawyer? What&#39;s that guy&#39;s name again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Still a little foggy, eh? Your lawyer is Steve Devia, and he&#39;s one of the best in the business. We had to hide who was going to swap with you so the press didn&#39;t harass him before he came to the clinic and the press still doesn&#39;t know your current identity. We wanted to give you a little time getting used to your new big body before going to a press conference and making the identity announcement.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right. I think Steve said something about that.&quot; Andy felt his head and in a panic realized that there was nothing there. He clasped both his hands to his head. &quot;My hair. My hair! It&#39;s gone!&quot; His voice was deep and rumbling. His voice sounded way deeper than his Dad&#39;s! <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he shaves his head because he started balding several years ago. But I assure you, this body is top grade quality, and it is difficult to find any body that is rated AAA above the 35 mark. Now your body is 35 and 3 months and it is in top peak physical condition. This man has built his body up with more muscle than 98% of the male population.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andy marveled as he was able to sit up at his new chest. His old chest was just a flat, lithe little boy&#39;s chest. Now he had heaving mounds that looked like they must be fake riding on top of him. His arms were inflated like balloons filled with sand or something. Heavy. He slowly raised his arm up. He started flexing it slowly. His arm was bigger than a baseball! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wooooooooow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you try and stand, please? Let&#39;s have you walk across the room...&quot; <br />
<br />
Andy did so, and it felt so strangely good. His legs were so much bigger and he could feel so much more of him existed now! It was like walking around in some kind of clay that had been attached to his body, or like people had glued rocks to his back, his thighs, his shoulders. It was like having rocks anywhere but his body pulsed in thick, meaty, living tissue and he got to feel every inch of it! <br />
<br />
He made it to the bathroom and did a double take. The 35 year old man in front of him was extremely masculine looking. He looked like he could be a cop. Thick stubble coated his new, chiseled face. The face of a Greek general or Roman king stared back at him. Shaved head with a few wrinkled in his forehead. A strong face looked back at him. A squarish face, very handsome and fatherly stared back at him. Strong, more deeply etched laugh lines. His face had been so smooth before and now he looked burly and very authoritarian! He frowned. The man frowned. He felt wonder as his hand explored his face and the man in the mirror mimicked him. He blinked his new deep set eyes and his eyebrows, the only hair left on his face, were a soft light graying brown. There was just the shadow of hair, like five o clock shadow, on either side of his head. He felt the fuzz where his luminous, shining star-making hair once had been. Nix that. This body never had that hair! <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you...think I look good?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The attractiveness of your donor was weighed heavily in the process of determining your ability to land leading roles, Andy. You are going to be a hit in Hollywood as an adult male movie star?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Andy gaped at his new frame and cockily flexed his new 20 inch arms happily, flexing in the mirror and making faces like a wrestler, trying to emulate looking scary and then silly, sticking his tongue out in the mirror. He noticed just now how his thin T-shirt clung to his meaty pecs. His chest now filled out his frame to a ridiculous degree, not to mention his back wings. Andy gingerly felt both, staring at himself in wonder and awe. <br />
<br />
Part of him was reeling in disgust that he wasn&#39;t a young, cute boy anymore but it was quickly being replaced with a pride in his newfound manhood! <br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that you&#39;re satisfied?&quot; Dr. Marcus prompted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s a super duper surprise but yeah, this rocks! I&#39;m so big! And tall!&quot; Andy was adult sized now. He could look the doctor in the eye now! An adult! He was tall as an adult! Wait...he was an adult now! His heart started beating with excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your lawyer is outside. He&#39;s going to take you home to his place until you can buy a house of your own. He will also be looking after your old body there. The two of you will be living together for a little while, at least, so he can fill you in on anything you need to know about fitness, keeping trim, proper nutrition etc. That&#39;s probably gonna be the toughest thing for you. As a grown up you can&#39;t really eat sweets like you used to and the fact is your career will depend on keeping in shape. I mention this as a doctor, listen to them both about the care for your new body. Many kids your age get fat when they get a new adult body. It happens all the time. Don&#39;t be one of those men. You are a man now. There are a few forms I just need you to sign...&quot; <br />
<br />
Andy signed the formalities one by one with his little kid signature. He was still learning how to write cursive. Did he still have to go to school? He really didn&#39;t want to. He hated school, even getting tutored on set. And he hated the other kids he had to be around when his parents did force him to go to school. They were so uninteresting and he was way cooler than they were. <br />
<br />
Soon his attorney, Steve Devia, came in to greet him, smiling from ear to ear, shaking his hands, and looking UP into his eyes. He asked how tall he was now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you must be about 6 foot 1, pal. I&#39;m 5&#39;9&quot; and you&#39;re several inches taller than me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Andy grabbed his new, bald and shaved head. &quot;So now I&#39;m supposed to be a grownup?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, big guy!&quot; Steve was as slick a lawyer as they came. Steve was handsome, his suit was expensive, and his hair was impeccably coiffed. He looked like a model who got paid to look as good as other men dream. &quot;So, let me fill you in on what&#39;s going on. This guy, this dumb motherfucker,&quot; he continued to a very shocked looking Andy inside a man&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said the emm effer word!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, kid, if you&#39;re gonna pass as a MAN you&#39;re gonna have to learn that men curse around each other. It&#39;s how we do things. So yes, you&#39;re gonna hear that word in the adult world. A lot. You understand?&quot; Steve asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Andy said, overreacting with a gaping mouth and too-wide grin and suppressing an ecstatic glee.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Moving right along. This dumbfuck whose body you took, his name is Bob Brewster.  And he embezzled a LOT of money at my firm. And since I am a partner in that firm, I had some things to say about it. Now. The two other partners and I decided that this dummy could either do one of two things. Go to prison for a number of years, or body swap...with you. The reason for this decision was that Bob Brewster has an incredible body. We did focus groups on his profile. All your agents were there, don&#39;t worry. They&#39;re all in on it. Bob was actually was an actor in several movies before he did some stunt acting and that&#39;s how he paid to get through law school. But he&#39;s got a classic face. We are already getting offers after extending our feelers. We are getting offers for cop dramas where you could play a police officer, family sitcoms where you play the Dad and not the kid, action movies where you blow the bad guys away with guns, military roles, you name it. You are gonna have a whole new career ahead of you for the next five years and what&#39;s more...is that the Academy is really starting to warm up to body swapped actors. Because it&#39;s more of a challenge for them to play roles convincingly they often get nominated for Oscars these days. It&#39;s an intersectional thing and the Academy loves that shit. So you play your cards right and we are gonna take you straight to the top!&quot; Steve finished his speech, looking very proud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! You really think I could get roles like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it. And a benefit of being a fucking musclestud in Hollywood is that you command respect. Your body is gonna command respect for you wherever you go. We&#39;ll put you with the right trainers, the right dieticians, and we might even be talking superhero franchise within a few years once you show what kind of acting chops you got. And that&#39;s where the real big money is. I have another client who got into that field and he&#39;s making 10 million a film now. I want that for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So my agent thinks all this could happen, too?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re gonna get you out of here. And get dressed first. Your new clothes are in the closet here. We have a leather jacket and some pants for godsakes. You&#39;re really gonna enjoy that new body once you start to jerk off in it. Have you ever been able to jerk off before? You know, masturbate?&quot; Steve asked him, carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I think so,&quot; the 35 year old gruff musclestud replied. &quot;That&#39;s where you rub your penis and it feels good, right?&quot; He sounded so unsure that it was almost comical. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and then you cum and you feel even better. Have you been able to make cum before cause you sure as hell can now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andy shook his head no and started to get upset. <br />
<br />
&quot;No no. Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll uh..you&#39;ll figure it out. Believe me. You&#39;re gonna do just great. Judging by the size of that dick you&#39;re packing you&#39;re gonna be the toast of the town pretty soon,&quot; Steve told him, noting the giant bulge trying to escape the boxer briefs they had placed on Andy while he was asleep. <br />
<br />
Andy put his new jeans on. They were huge adult sized jeans and they almost as tall as he used to be just a day before. He mouthed a &quot;woooow&quot; and put them on, his leg muscles bulging against the fabric and filling out the pants in a way most men could only dream about. It felt good being so muscular, more so than he ever could have dreamed. <br />
<br />
Andy followed his lawyer Steve out and emerged from the hospital a new man...literally. He marveled at how he was just as tall if not taller than all the grown up men he walked past. <br />
<br />
He had a feeling he was actually going to enjoy being a grown up man.</p>
