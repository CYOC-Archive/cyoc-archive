<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I began changing and I noticed red scales covering my body at an alarming rate. The scales rapidly covered your hands, torso, and legs and my body felt like it was burning. I screamed in complete agony, and then out of the corner of my eye I saw the dragon walk up to me. The dragon seemed alarmed to say the least, and I looked up at him as I clutched the mattress in excruciating pain.<br />
<br />
The dragon then looked away for a moment then he said,&quot;I&#39;m sorry, for your pain and for this.&quot; I didn’t know what this dragon meant until he snapped his fingers and suddenly I passed out for no reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
I then woke up in a black space, and it felt as if I was in a dream. I was naked, and moments later a tall, red and orange scaled dragon woman with a pregnant gut, who was also naked, appeared in front of me. I paused looking up at her in awe for a few moments before she slumped down onto her rear with a large thud, and she looked at me. <br />
<br />
&quot;So this is what my soul has become...&quot; She said and looked up at me, and I paused then took a step back unsure how to feel about this. The dragon then smiled and said,&quot;Greetings human, I am...well was Madasa, Queen of the dragon race and brood mother to a vast portion of it. I will not harm you, because I only wish to speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused then I nodded and slowly made my way closer towards her and I wearily asked,&quot;Wh...what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madasa let out a sigh then she nodded and said,&quot;One of my nobles have found you. You used to be me, but my body grew weak and my soul reincarnated. Right now, I can only speak to you this one time to explain what going to happen.&quot; I paused then nodded and muttered,&quot;Uh...Okay then...&quot;<br />
<br />
Madasa then closed her eyes and nodded smiling then she began,&quot;As I said, I was queen until I fell very ill at an elderly age. My last orders were to my noblest knights and all who loyally served under me. They were to find my soul, and transform bless the host with a younger version of my body. I also granted whoever found and performed this transformation my highest blessing that I am able to grant, the pleasure to be my mate and king of our species.&quot;<br />
<br />
I listened in then I paused and I asked her,&quot;Wait, OUR species?!&quot; Madasa nodded and said,&quot;Silly human, you are my soul&#39;s host, so you have the pleasure to continue in my place. My sons and daughters were informed of this too, and they shall return to you to help serve. You should feel honored human, for you will experience the privilege, longevity, and true experience of how it feels to rule over a race and help it expand firstclaw.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then motioned to open my mouth but suddenly a sparkling light engulfed my body and when it disappeared I looked down and screamed. My body had changed to look like a younger version of Madasa. I was covered in red scales, except for the large thick orange scales on my stomach and slightly softer ones on two DD cup breasts. I had two large wings, a tail, and my hands and feet were no longer human, they were giant reptilian claws. I couldn’t see much of my face but I could feel the many sharp and jagged teeth in my mouth, which had extended into a muzzle. Finally, between my legs was a soft set of lips that were scaled and sensitive to the touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!&quot; I roared in the voice of an 18 year old girl, and I paused to cover my mouth on reaction. Madasa smiled at this then she said,&quot;Perfect, and though you may not have any eggs in you now, you shall soon experience the miracle of motherhood soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! I don’t want this!&quot; I cried, but Madasa shook her head and said,&quot;I apologize, but this is a blessing, not a curse. Come here now dear, before we part ways for eternity.&quot; I paused, and with nothing else much to do I walked up to her and she wrapped her arms around me like a hug. Madasa then kissed me on my forehead and her body suddenly disappeared into glimmering dust that disappeared into my body. I felt like that I should feel sad for a moment, but then the area on my forehead felt like it was burning, and I was soon being pulled back into reality by this pain.<br />
<br />
________<br />
<br />
When I woke up I sat up immediately and saw that I was still within the almost regal looking bedroom. I was breathing heavily and in a cold sweat, and my forehead still felt like it was burned and it hurt. I touched it and growled, but I could feel something there like some sort of brand.<br />
<br />
I then looked down at my body and at the first sight of orange scaled breasts, I knew that what happened in that dream was too real for comfort. It was then I looked up and saw him, the dragon from before, and his jaw was dropped then he smiled and said,&quot;You’re awake, thank goodness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still clutching my head, I nodded to the dragon and said,&quot;Y...yeah, and between that, my body, my burning forehead and that unforgettable dream, I think I need an explanation.&quot; The dragon paused and gave me a puzzled look then he said,&quot;Wait dream? I didn’t know the spell did that. That burning though is just your royal mark my queen. It was applied by...uh....your son of sorts. Garl was his name, and he seemed to know more about this than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...? Ugh! Look...just tell me how to make it stop.&quot; I snarled still grasping my head and he winced at first and then he nodded and he walked up to me. He held up the tip of his claw then he touched the brand and it felt like a wave of energy passed through my body.<br />
<br />
The burning didn’t stop, but it subsided to the point where it was bearable. I then dropped my arms to the side, and I looked at the dragon. I panting from the experience then I asked,&quot;Okay, I&#39;m fine now, thanks...I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon let out a sigh of relief too then he said,&quot;No need to thank me Queen Madasa. I would have done it no matter what, so...I know you wanted an explanation but you said you had a dream? Apologies for changing the subject, but Garl wanted to know if you did have one, and he wanted to know what it was.&quot; I was finally able to catch my breath and then I let out a sigh and said,&quot;Let’s just say some things happened, and they were...well, a bit private. I spoke to someone and they gave me an explanation in my mind, so I wanted to hear your excuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon paused then stuttered,&quot;Uh...erm...excuse?&quot; He looked nervous for a moment in his cyan scales then he took a deep breath and said,&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll explain everything to you, and tell you what I know. Long ago you were sick, fallen ill with an incurable disease at the time. You knew you were going to die considering your elderly condition, so you gathered your most loyal subjects and told them to find the body your soul was in after you died. You said to use a certain spell in order o change this body into your own again, and you could rule your kingdom again. The one who found and transformed you would ultimately become your mate, and king by extension. A...and well....I was the one who...erm found you and transformed you. Honestly I’m just a bit fearful right now in your presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
I paused and my eyes widened for a moment as I heard the almost exact information from him as I did from my dream. The dragon then walked closer to me and he said,&quot;I uh...my name is Onyx, and before you ask, my father was your noble back then and he grew colorblind, so he thought my scales were darker.&quot; I then cocked my head to the side and I stared at Onyx, and I kind of pictured his personality a bit differently at first. <br />
<br />
It was the Onyx cleared his throat and he said,&quot;Sorry, about the awkwardness, I know I must be confusing you. I am told that your mind is completely different from what you were in your previous life, and at the time I had only seen you once....as a hatchling.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A hatchling...&quot; I said to myself then I realized how he must feel now,&quot;Oooooh, I think I know how you feel. I don’t think I was there, or...me now was there. This whole thing is fucked up.&quot; I said then I looked at my claw and moved each of my four claw tipped fingers. <br />
<br />
Onyx watched me for a few moments, and then he said,&quot;So, would you like me to leave?&quot; I looked over at him then said,&quot;Oh no, not at all actually. This is just very awkward for me...and you...I guess. I don’t know how to be a dragon much less the queen. That and uh...I’m female...&quot; I blushed and I looked down at my breasts curiously and I lifted the blankets of the bed up for a brief moment too and saw my vagina.<br />
<br />
A few moments later I felt a claw on my shoulder and I looked up to see Onyx and he lifted the covers for a moment. I blushed then I watched Onyx turn back towards my face and he said,&quot;You’re beautiful, you’re the queen, you do what everyone else can&#39;t and all of this,&quot; Onyx gestured around the room as he spoke,&quot;this is yours. This is your reward, and when I first saw you...the other you, I was afraid then too. Who wouldn’t be afraid when alone in your presence? You’re our queen, and you should feel happy to be our queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blushed and I felt my heart skip a beat as I stared into his eyes. I then smiled at him and said,&quot;I&#39;m not a queen, and never your queen.&quot; I noticed Onyx&#39;s expression and he looked like his heart dropped. But before he could say anything I reached over and took the claw that he used to lift the blankets and I said,&quot;I&#39;m not a queen Onyx, not yet anyways. A queen needs a king to be a queen, and I can never be your queen, because you haven’t accepted your place by my side as king. And even then, I won’t be your queen but rather, your soulmate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Onyx then blushed and he looked down at me and asked,&quot;Do you really mean that?&quot; I paused then nodded and replied,&quot;Of course I do, and as long as you can help me get used to things like my body and my life then this will be much easier to deal with together.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then turned around to face Onyx in my bed then I tried to stand up on my two digitigrade claws and fell forwards. Onyx caught in his arms and he hugged me closely then said,&quot;I think we can do that, and your sons and daughters wish to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I leaned against Onyx for a moment then blushed again then said,&quot;Oh god!&quot; Onyx then helped me back onto the bed and he sat down next to me and asked,&quot;What is it?&quot; I looked over at Onyx worried then I said,&quot;If I&#39;ve been dead for...how many years now? Anyways, do you know how many? Oh dear lord some might have been infants when I died!&quot;<br />
<br />
Onyx placed his hand on my shoulder then he said,&quot;Woah now, calm down and breathe. You were elderly or the other you was, and she couldn’t lay any more eggs. Physically most are probably older than you now, and on top of that there was one egg, but that daughter of yours is healthy, here and she’s thrilled knowing that she can meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up at Onyx then asked,&quot;Wait, how old is she?&quot; Onyx shrugged and he said,&quot;I&#39;d say 160, maybe more or less, but still a cute adolescent child nonetheless. Her egg hatched late but she was full of energy when I met her not too long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then looked at Onyx, eyes wide again, and I asked,&quot;D...did you say 160? How old are you? How old am I? How long do dragons live?&quot; Onyx smiled awkwardly for a moment then he laughed and said,&quot;Don’t worry, we’re within a decade of each other, I can tell that much. I’m 1,712 years old, and last I checked our soecies&#39;s life expectancy is roughly 127,986 years, but I&#39;m not quite sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
My jaw dropped and I replied to him,&quot;That sounds really young, are you sure?&quot; Onyx nodded and said,&quot;Maturity for us is fast, but once we reach our prime it’s nice and long until we get near 100,000 years. Technically though, I’m not in my prime yet though, I’m an adult by all means but I’m about a few more thousand years from it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded then looked around the room and back to him then I asked,&quot;Okay, so what should we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Onyx then turned to me and replied,</p>
