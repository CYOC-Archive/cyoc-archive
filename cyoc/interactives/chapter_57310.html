<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>We had spent the first couple of hours figuring out what weapons were best suited 
to each of us. I shouldn't have been surprised when we found out that Semele's 
weapon was the bow and mine and Nausikaa's was the sword. Dike's weapon turned 
out to be a dagger. We were separated to train with our weapons.</p>
<p>Since both Nausikaa and I had swords we were training together and I quickly 
learned that I was more comfortable with using a sword and shield. It didn't give me 
the power that I would have if I used both hands but it gave me some more options. 
Nausikaa said that she wasn't comfortable with a shield so she would just use a sword. 
Our training began with learning how to draw our swords from sheaths either on our 
backs or on our waists. We then learned how to sheath them and for me learning how 
to draw and sheath my sword while wearing a shield. I have to say that with a sword it 
was easier drawing my sword from my back instead of my side. We then learned 
different moves with our swords then moved on to actually practicing.</p>
<p>I had been doing pretty good sparring with the merman that was teaching me. That 
was I was doing good until I let my attention wonder for a second. I saw Nausikaa out 
of the corner of my eye sparring and being pretty ferocious pressing the merman who 
was teaching her back. In that second of inattention my merman ran his sword through 
my stomach. I guess I was shocked because I hardly felt it and when I looked up into 
his face he was smiling showing his pointed teeth like he was looking forward to eating 
me. Did I forget to mention that the merpeople I've seen are not the <i>Disney</i> 
version? Well the only thing they had in common was the bottom half was a fish tail 
and the top half was humanoid. They had scales covering almost all of their body with 
webbed hands. On their necks you could see their gills working. They had sharp teeth 
like shark teeth. Where you would expect ears they had fins and they had no hair. 
They came in different colors and patterns. The one I had been sparring with was blue 
with black stripes like a tiger. Before we had started he introduced himself as Kyros. 
Now he leaned in and said, "You were distracted which in a real battle would almost 
guarantee you're death. Fortunately for you these blades are magic and don't actually 
harm you but it does hurt when something like this happens." To emphasize his point 
he wrenched his sword a bit and I felt pain shoot through my stomach. He then pulled 
his sword free and I doubled over in pain sinking to my knees. "The pain will pass in a 
moment," he said with a suppressed laugh in his voice.</p>
<p>The pain did subside after a moment or two and I stood up again. I looked at 
Kyros and said, "You won't be able to do that again."</p>
<p>"Then prepare to defend yourself," Kyros said laughing.</p>
<p>Before we could begin though a hippocampus came up to us and said, <i>"Forgive 
me Lady Anthea but Lord Poseidon wishes to see you and your sisters in the throne 
room."</i> He didn't actually speak it out loud but it was in my mind.</p>
<p>I looked at Kyros and said, "This hippocampus just told me that my father wants to 
see me and my sisters in the throne room."</p>
<p>"Then you should go," Kyros said taking my word for it.</p>
<p>We entered the throne room to see Poseidon sitting on his throne with a hand on 
his head. He looked at us and said, "Well you get to know what's going on now 
instead of a few days." We waited in silence for a couple of minutes before he 
continued. "I was hoping that it would be sorted before I told you but a couple weeks 
ago someone was able to sneak onto Olympus and leave a message saying that they 
would be back. Then a few days later we find a slaughtered mortal in the throne room. 
I don't think I've ever seen my brother as angry as he was upon seeing the body."</p>
<p>"How can someone sneak onto Olympus without Heracles or one of the gods 
knowing?" I asked not liking this bit of news.</p>
<p>Poseidon kind of smiled and said, "You're one of the few who called him by his 
Greek name instead of his Roman name."</p>
<p>"Who are you talking about?" Nausikaa asked looking bewildered.</p>
<p>"You probably know him better as Hercules," I said and seeing the blank looks on 
their faces I continued, "or maybe not. Heracles is the son of Zeus and he was made 
immortal and now protects Olympus." I turned to Poseidon and said, "So Father how 
could someone sneak onto Olympus?"</p>
<p>Poseidon sighed and said, "The are only two ways we can think that it can be 
done. The first is if someone is using Hade's Helm of Darkness but he still has it. 
Which leaves the second possibility."</p>
<p>"That someone is using power you're not familiar with or that's on the same level 
as your powers or maybe both," I said shuddering at the thought of someone 
possessing that kind of power. "Perhaps it's the same person that brought us 
here."</p>
<p>"That would be a logical assumption," Poseidon said sighing. "That's why Zeus 
wants the four of you to explore the mortal world for clues and to seek out those that 
came into our world with you."</p>
<p>"I think I see the reason behind that," I said nodding. "If it is the same person or 
the same power you may be able to track them if you can get enough of us 
together."</p>
<p>"That's what we hope to be able to do," Poseidon said nodding. "You know that 
you'll be on your own during this quest. However I can give you a bit of help with a 
gift." He stood up and shrank down to human size then he picked up a tray with four 
necklaces on it. They were just a chain with a pearl clasped in a lobster claw. "These 
pearls will protect you from most of the transformations you may encounter," he 
explained. "They will only protect you if you wear them so be sure to always wear 
them. If you lose them or they're stolen they will reappear around your necks after a 
few minutes. They can also reverse a transformation but all four of them need to be 
used and they can only do that once a day. Just take them out of the setting and place 
them on the ground around the transformed person. They can also detect if someone 
has been transformed. I want you girls to be careful though since I don't know if they'll 
protect you from being transformed by whatever power brought you here. Now go get 
ready for your trip back to the mortal world."</p>
<p>"What about our hair Father?" I asked. "Blue hair isn't exactly a natural hair color 
in the mortal world."</p>
<p>Poseidon laughed but it sounded forced and said, "Your hair will change back to 
the color it was before I transformed you. One more thing before you go. The pearls 
won't induce any pain when you transform yourselves or someone else. However 
some transformations may be painful. Now go."</p>
<p>We went back to our room to prepare. I knew that we would probably be 
journeying through all types of climates so I made sure that we packed clothes that 
would be suitable for just about any climate. Semele and I packed skirts and dresses 
as well as shirts and pants into our bags but Dike and Nausikaa refused to pack skirts 
and dresses into their bags. Nausikaa didn't want to pack or wear any bras but I 
pointed out that mortal girls did wear bras and if she didn't wear one she would stand 
out and be the target of some unwelcome stares. She finally relented and packed 
some bras. Once we were ready we went to the hippocampi stables where we were 
given our weapons along with nags of mortal money and gold drachmas. I strapped 
my sword to my back and mounting the hippocampi we waved to Poseidon and 
Amphitrite as we sped off on our quest.</p>
<p>It was about an hour before be were standing on the shore of the lake where we 
were transformed. It made sense that our quest would start here. I looked up into the 
sky to see the moon hanging above us. There was something about the moon and 
forest that seemed odd to me. Of course this was CYOC so that shouldn't have 
seemed odd but it was. I looked at my sisters and saw that their hair had returned to 
the color it was before. Nausikaa was nervously fingering her necklace like she 
expected to be attacked any moment. I didn't blame her since we could be attacked at 
any moment. I looked up at the sky again and said, "We should go into the forest a bit 
away from the water and set up camp."</p>
<p>"But I feel safer near the water," Dike said looking uneasy.</p>
<p>"Well animals probably come down here to drink the water and it could be 
dangerous to be in a tent close to it," I said. "However if all of you agree to make 
camp here we will. So what will we do?"</p></p>
