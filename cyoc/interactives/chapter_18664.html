<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“He wet himself!” Ric laughed as the now baby sized Mr. Mendes soaked his over sized briefs.<br />
<br />
“Oh I have a great idea!” Josh said and ran back to the bed room for the book.  He was flipping through it as he came back.  Finding what he was looking for he began to read an enchantment out loud.  There was a sudden “POP!” and all the hair on Francisco’s body except for his head fell off his body.  Not only that his short hair suddenly grew longer down to his little shoulders.  He was now as hairless as a baby, with hair any mother would want for their baby girl.  Rolling around on the floor giggling to himself, he could easily pass as a little baby girl those not looking hard enough.  His now hairless body made him look years and years younger.<br />
<br />
“Whats going on!” screamed Francisco’s adult mind as he looked up at the two boys. He tried to call out for help, but all that came out was gibberish.  He also could not control his body.  It was working on auto pilot and was acting like a baby.<br />
<br />
Ric picked up Mr. Mendes with easy and carried him over to the table, “Josh go get me a wash cloth so I can use it on Franky here as a diaper.  Soon Josh had returned and they used the cloth to make a diaper for the shrunken adult.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mendes was mortified.  He felt so humiliated, here he was an adult being treated like a baby by kids.  What was worse was his body was betraying him and acting like a baby too!  With out any control by him, he began to giggle and laugh as the kids picked him up and cradled him in their arms around the house.<br />
<br />
“We need to go shopping for the baby!” Josh said to his brother who quickly agreed.  They ran up to Mr. Mendes room and found some cash and shoved it into their pockets and ran back downstairs.  Ric grabbed the new Franky and carried him out with him, locking the door behind him.  “We’re going to have so much fun aren’t we little Franky?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should call HER Franny instead,” laughed Josh.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mendes just made cooing noises, though inside his head he was screaming for them to turn him back.  But that wasn’t in the cards for him today.<br />
<br />
_____What Happens Now?_____<br />
<br />
<br />
The two boys walked to the near by Megastore where they planned on buying the new baby Franny some nice girly clothes.  Ric held the baby sized Mr. Mendes in his arms as they walked to the store, the small body giggling and wooing as they walked.  To those watching it just looked like two brothers taking their little sister out for a walk.<br />
<br />
“Take me home! Stop this!” screamed Francisco’s mind, but his body betrayed him.  On the outside it looked as though he was enjoying himself emensly.  Though the shop was close, the swaying in Ric’s arms began to have an effect on Francisco, who began to nod off to sleep.  Soon the baby sized adult was asleep in Ric’s arms, and stayed that way as they entered the store.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get Mr. Mendes some diapers,” Josh said as they walked around the store.<br />
<br />
“Francisco, I mean Franny needs some little dresses and shirts too, as girly as possibly.  He, er, she should be as cute as possible,” Ric answered back.<br />
<br />
The two boys continued talking about what Mr. Mendes needed, diapers, pink dresses, frilly socks, baby food, and such as they shopped.  The whole time they continued to mix up Mr. Mendes name, some time calling him Franny, some times Francisco, some times Mr. Mendes.  It didn’t seem to be noticed by anyone around them as they shopped, a few ladies even stopped them and told them they had a lovely little sister.<br />
<br />
There was one person however who did notice the mix ups.  Hank Thomson, an eighteen year old from the local high school had first seen the boys as they entered and was planning on harassing them, as he had done before in the neighborhood.  But when he saw the baby, he had quickly turned down a different aisle, but continued to listen.  His original plans on just bugging some kids had turned into a fantasy come true.  Was it true, was Mr. Mendes, really that little baby?  He had gotten to see it a few times as he followed the boys around the store, and besides the size and long hair, it did look like the teacher.<br />
<br />
He had a score to settle with the teacher.  Not only did Mr. Mendes teach at the elementary school, he also taught at the high school for the remedial students trying to catch up.  He had failed Hank, who now was going to have to take summer school if he hoped to graduate.  Hank had become a joke to his friends because he was the oldest of his friends, 18, and adult, and the only one not to graduate.  Yes, he had a score to settle with Francisco Mendes.  <br />
<br />
He followed the boys around the store as they picked things up for Franny.  They were picking up a pink bonnet when Francisco woke up, “I hadda scary dweam.”<br />
<br />
He put his little hands to his mouth, “Its weal!”<br />
<br />
“Looks like little Franny can talk again,” Josh said, “and if she knows what’s good for her, she’s be a good little girl, wont she?”<br />
<br />
Ric pinched Mr. Mendes on the leg, which hurt him more than he had expected, so he only nodded.  He was afraid of what would happen if he acted out in public, who would realized who he really was, and what if they did and the boys spanked him!?<br />
<br />
“I be good,” he pouted, he could talk again, but he couldn’t talk well.  He at least had full control of his body again.<br />
<br />
“I guess what ever spell he read was only temporary,” Josh said a little disappointed, he was hoping to have a lot of fun humiliating the adult.  Than he got an idea, with the right spell, when they got home, they could keep him a baby indefinetly.  “I think we should get little Franny home Ric.”<br />
<br />
They boys headed to the cashier and paid for the bundle of things they had gotten to dress Mr. Mendes in.  Before leaving, however, Ric got the idea of changing Franny into her new diapers and clothes in the restroom.  So they took the little adult into the restroom and laid him down on the pull out table.<br />
<br />
Josh pulled the make shift diaper off of the tiny adult who now laid naked for all to see in the Megastore restroom.  Francisco turned a beet red in his embarrassment, which he thought couldn’t get any worse.  He was wrong.  To his horror he started to get an erection. <br />
<br />
“Oh looky, she likes getting attention, don’t worry baby we’ll make sure you’ll get all the attention you deserve,” Josh said, putting the new diaper on Francisco’s hard on.  Then he slipped a little pink shirt with a picture of a bunny over his head.  Lastly he slipped a pair of pink frilly socks on the small adults feet. <br />
<br />
“There, she looks adorable now,” Ric said, picking up Mr. Mendes, Josh holding the rest of the packages, “let’s get her home.”<br />
<br />
They left the store and were heading across the parking lot when Hank jumped out from behind a car.  He startled the boys who jumped back.<br />
<br />
“If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn’t have believed it.  I don’t know how you too freaks did it, but you did.  He grabbed at Ric and pulled the tiny Mr. Mendes out of his arms.  Ric tried to grab him back, but Hank easily pushed him to the ground.  Josh ran up but he too was pushed easily to the ground.  <br />
<br />
“Weeve me awonen,” Mr. Mendes yelled, embarrassed as he said it, he sounded like a baby.  He pounded his little fist on Hank’s chest but did no good, he was to strong for him now.<br />
<br />
“It really is true, you are Mr. Mendes,” Hank picked up the fallen bag of merchandise, and laughed as he turned to leave, “I’m going to have so much fun with you…”</p>
