<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Owen walked alone by the side of the road, only having his thoughts and regrets to keep him company. As far as anyone could see, he was still seething, still bitter and hateful as far as what he showed. Inside? <i>Every time. Every fucking time, it seems like you&#39;re about to get somewhere better, shithead. Have better friends. Keep better company. You just talk - and show you&#39;re only suited for the old gang. I&#39;ll die a member of Evropa Brotherhood, it seems.</i> And that wasn&#39;t anything to celebrate, as far as he was concerned.<br />
<br />
A swift kick at some pebbles along the side of the road into a nearby river, and Owen thought back to his last relationship. <i>Thought that Emily was going to make me a better man. That I&#39;d have to shape up. But no. Soon as I fucking could I showed her who I really was. That she was just a white girl to have a trad family with - and of course she doesn&#39;t want that. Who fucking wants that? I don&#39;t fucking want that, but I have to want that.</i> He took out his phone, and looked at her number on the list of numbers he could text.<br />
<br />
Amazing she hadn&#39;t blocked him. She broke up with him as fast as could be once he made an ass of himself, and he didn&#39;t blame her for that. &quot;Danke Schoen, darling...Danke Schoen...&quot; Fuck, no matter what it seemed fighting was the only thing he was good for. Couldn&#39;t carry a tune, either. He didn&#39;t have anyone else to tell him so, but only his constant negative reflection.<br />
<br />
Of course he couldn&#39;t be happy that Lucky had achieved that through the device. Of course. No small part of the anger and rage Owen felt was down to simple jealousy of how open those guys were - intertwined with his feelings about the device. Was he really the only one to feel the slightest bit apprehensive? And the fact that it let those guys do openly what Owen concealed in shame and public displays of bravado...it just pissed him off.<br />
<br />
<i>That device just...there&#39;s something about it I cannot like. It&#39;s like, I&#39;m looking at it and I see something the others don&#39;t see. Why would it be down there? Why would it be past so many layers of bunker and in such an esoteric chamber? Nothing good comes of it. It&#39;s an abomination---</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Owen!&quot; The young skinhead&#39;s ruminations, thoughts and self loathing were interrupted by the shout from the back from Martin - who had for some reason came to try and catch up with him after his meltdown. Stepping up toward him, overcoming his inclination to disregard the young man due to how much of a disobedient show he made, Martin sighed, &quot;I know - I know - that whatever is going on with the device, it&#39;s far outside your comfort zone. It seems scary, the way it seems to change people&#39;s bodies - hell, people&#39;s minds even. I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;m managing it well, but I won&#39;t lie - there&#39;s a natural inclination in several areas that I&#39;m unfamiliar with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I---I just---I&#39;m not used to----&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That said.&quot; Martin cut him off, &quot;I can&#39;t be having you talking and acting like that, understood?&quot; Crossing his arms, the Roman made his way over to the 20 year old punk and stated in a low tone, &quot;I don&#39;t want you calling Lucky or Scottie names like that any more. I know you wouldn&#39;t get so upset if you <i>didn&#39;t</i> care. So if you actually want to stay around...act like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen felt at once like he was getting boxed in, spoken to like a misbehaving teen by a teacher who caught him with a can of booze and a cigarette. He&#39;d never known Martin to talk like this, even when Martin was upset with him - making it clearer things were changing around their group, and that there was a realignment happening. Owen flinched in a certain familiar way when Martin drew up even closer to him, impressing on the young man that for all of his own size and strength, Martin had ended up with a slight albeit impressive lead over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep all that in mind. Your status here is no longer as ironclad as it once was.&quot; Martin spoke like a commander, and Owen had never been so conscious of the fact that out of the four guys, he was the youngest at 20. <br />
<br />
Martin glanced down at Owen, though the way he did so seemed different somehow, &quot;I am willing to...sweeten the deal, if you&#39;re willing to behave yourself, fascista.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sweeten the deal? Like---Like how? Money---is it mon---&quot; Owen bit his lip as he started to talk, sweat beads running down his forehead. This kind of intimate contact with the kind of man he&#39;d long admired was overwhelming. He&#39;d seen Martin before as his ideal aryan man, with a distinct sexual undertone to it...and now this...this was happening. Actually happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think we both know what it is,&quot; Martin said, again cutting off Owen as he suddenly pressed up against the younger man. One arm wrapping around the broad shoulders of the skinhead and holding tight to him. Near instantly, Owen&#39;s early 20s hormones had him erect, even though he didn&#39;t act it - a blush settling over his face as Martin ran his free hand down Owen&#39;s face, thumb pulling those tight lips open and forcing a harsh breath out.<br />
<br />
Owen let out a series of awkward, aroused moans as Martin continued moving his hand down - tracing the vein along the side of Owen&#39;s neck, moving down to the young man&#39;s chest, and swirling his fingers around his right nipple. &quot;I---I ohh---I&#39;m...&quot; Owen was interrupted by a gasp as Martin quickly moved his hand down and lifted Owen&#39;s shirt, hand sliding up to the man&#39;s pecs and then back down to his abs. His arm around Owen&#39;s shoulders moved, and started feeling up his back, teasing Owen&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a taste of what we&#39;ll get to do tomorrow night. However much you want to do. However much you&#39;re comfortable.&quot; Martin kissed Owen&#39;s smooth cheek, the skinhead quaking with desire he wished he didn&#39;t feel. An involuntary pump of his hips and Owen almost let out a little cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m---I&#39;m not---I&#39;m <i>not fucking gay!</i> I&#39;m not---&quot; He couldn&#39;t help himself but moan though as he felt Martin&#39;s hand at his front grip his rock hard erection and give it a couple pumps. The skinhead responded by awkwardly thrusting into Martin&#39;s hand. Eyes screwed shut and - despite his need for a stony front - Owen grinned widely from the sensation as he lost himself to the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, you have a girlfriend. Had a girlfriend. But whatever the case, you&#39;re obviously interested.&quot; Martin stopped and stepped away. Leaving the clearly aroused, blushing and erect Owen standing there, clothes disheveled, mouth hanging open and hand twitching toward the front of his shorts. &quot;I&#39;m not gay per se myself,&quot; Martin explained, &quot;But I am willing to do what I need to in order to facilitate unity in my m---in my people. If that means satiating the confused sexual impulses of my skinhead street fighter, so be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Owen gulped, &quot;So---so what do I---what do I---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat off.&quot; Martin shrugged and started walking back, &quot;Just remember. If you want things like this to be a regular thing with me, you&#39;ll behave and you&#39;ll behave well. Be a good young guy, don&#39;t use any of those cruel words swirling around in your skull with the guys - and I&#39;ll help you deal with your desires at your speed and however you&#39;re comfortable doing so.&quot; <br />
<br />
Owen promptly nodded intensely, looking down to try and make it less obvious that he was excited for this. In his entire life he&#39;d never really had an opportunity. Sure there were times when he and the other guys in the gang would all watch porn together and jack off, but he had to be careful - really careful - to not let those wandering eyes be too obvious. He couldn&#39;t let them know his eyes watched the buxom, athletic woman on the screen and the well muscled street punks sitting around in their boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll...I uh...I will...&quot; Owen murmured at first, &quot;I will!&quot; He said more loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good man,&quot; Martin walked back over and ran a hand over Owen&#39;s smooth scalp, leaving the younger man shivering...and then left him there with his troubled libido. As he walked away, Martin said, &quot;And one more thing. If the guys want to play around with the Eon Chronicle, let them. It&#39;s their right to use it as they please before we turn it in to Hartmann.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even in the heady mist of arousal that Owen was submerged in, something Martin said as he walked away stuck with him. The thing he called that damn sphere that started this whole mess. Owen wasn&#39;t so completely lost in his need that he forgot what Martin said. He fell on to his ass on the side of the road for a moment. <i>He called it the Eon Chronicle. He called it the Eon Chronicle and we never decided on a name, or learned a name for whatever that thing is.</i><br />
<br />
If anything, Owen&#39;s decision to not use it was made ironclad with this. He wouldn&#39;t be as open as he had been. He wouldn&#39;t say those things. But he had his eye on whatever was going on with those two and the device, this Eon Chronicle - or whatever its real name was. <br />
<br />
But for right now, he could try and figure something out when he got back. For right now, he needed to clear his head. For all that the other guys, in person and on reddit, talked about how NoFap made them more focused and clear-minded, Owen always felt better after a good, hard wank. His thoughts were on that weird encounter with Martin, who he swore was straight - yet here he was fooling around with Owen for---for what? Unity? Well, he&#39;d take it. He&#39;d fucking take it.<br />
<br />
Owen&#39;s fantasies played out through his head as he stepped off the road and behind a tree, furiously beating off as he imagined Martin continuing to feel him, pump his cock, and touch him like that. Owen had vanishingly little idea what constituted a gay sex act, but he knew from experience just observed that he enjoyed whatever it was Martin just did to him.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
While Owen was working off his stresses and realizing something in the process, Scottie and Lucky were in the process of enjoying their newly empowered bodies. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, we at least get some free time away from the idiot, and at most we&#39;re rid of him. However much comes of Martin&#39;s move after him.&quot; Lucky contemplated aloud as he felt up the newly formed body that Scottie had grown into. He was not quite as rippling and large as the others, more having grown into a more muscular build as a necessity - but not entirely one given to size. After all, a ninja had to be more athletic, capable of moving quickly, and able to utilize their surroundings.<br />
<br />
But missions and serving his daimyo were the furthest thing from Scottie&#39;s mind as he enjoyed the feeling of Lucky&#39;s strong, calloused hands rubbing over his skin. Both were nude, and both were intent on enjoying the powerful bodies they&#39;d acquired from this most inexplicable gift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...Kimochi...Kimochi...&quot; Scottie hardly even noticed himself slipping into using Japanese as he let Lucky continue to feel up his body. He&#39;d never been touched, enjoyed in such a way - had his body appreciated in this sort of way. It was new to him, and he was enjoying it entirely - finally getting this kind of reaction to his looks.<br />
<br />
The muscular French Knight grinned as he saw his Japanese compatriot moaning and grunting as their petting got heavier. Already, Scottie&#39;s cock was getting hard again. Seemed like the changes bequeathed a degree more endurance than they had before. Honestly, Lucky was excited for this - and possibly for fooling around more with the device. It could be fun to see how he&#39;d handle changing more. But for now he was very happy with his new, well muscled body.<br />
<br />
Just something to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Eon Chronicle is the fucking best...&quot; Scottie gasped, hardly thinking much about the name. <br />
<br />
&quot;That it is, my friend.&quot; And Lucky didn&#39;t note the suddenness of their &quot;toy&quot; having a name. <br />
<br />
Seeing that Lucky was very obviously in need too, Scottie leaned forward, &quot;Allow me to help you with your burden, sir knight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re---ooh, you&#39;re too kind---!!&quot; Scottie then took Lucky&#39;s cock into his mouth, bobbing up and down on the Frenchman&#39;s organ with an eagerness that compensated for a lack of experience in performing this sex act. Lucky propped himself up in the van against the wall with one hand, eyes glancing upward and face flush with pleasure. He&#39;d never really gotten a good blowjob like this before, even when he cavorted with the peasant girls...<br />
<br />
It&#39;d figure a man knew what a man liked. Lucky wasn&#39;t about to change his sexual habits but he was looking forward to at least trying to bring Scottie along on any trip to go a&#39;wenching to give the ladies a tip or two. Indeed, Lucky didn&#39;t notice in the heat of the moment any preponderance. <br />
<br />
Seeing as he had helped Scottie get off before, and engaged in heavy petting besides, it did not take very long whatsoever for Lucky to grunt and then have to grit his teeth as he felt his orgasm starting to push into his awareness. His eyes squinted, his body slick with sweat. His free hand gripped Scottie&#39;s hair lightly, and he was afraid if he said anything too complicated he might lose all control whatsoever. So instead he just moaned, groaned and tried to let it last as long as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, heavenly...heavenly...&quot; Lucky managed to get out.<br />
<br />
But Scottie kept well on going. He was bent on seeing Lucky brought to finish, and there was little left he hadn&#39;t done. One more flourish with his tongue and he felt that telltale sign through their closeness. Felt the twinge up the cock. Saw the balls clench, the ass cheeks flex, and Lucky&#39;s muscles tensing and flexing. The knight let out a manly roar of arousal as he finally hit orgasm - at first filling Scottie&#39;s mouth and then painting his upper chest and shoulders as he fell backward.<br />
<br />
Lucky almost felt dizzy, but he was glad he went ahead with that. Scottie meanwhile was cleaning himself up - swallowing what he didn&#39;t towel off of himself. &quot;Next time, you go down on me,&quot; Scottie said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, I&#39;ll give it a try. Pretty good for what I&#39;m guessing is your first time.&quot; Lucky wiped off his forehead...<br />
<br />
And then Martin knocked a few times on the van doors. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for the cavorting duo to get a spare pair of boxers on, as poorly as they fit now over swollen glutes, quads and thighs. The doors opened up and Martin glanced at the two next to naked specimens in front of him, detached and uninterested. He crossed his arms and stated, &quot;The issue has been resolved, as far as I&#39;m concerned. Owen Bolton will be on his best behavior going forward. He has incentives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t expect him to tough it out now that we&#39;re able to be so open,&quot; Lucky reclined and glanced over at Scottie, then at Martin again, &quot;You...threaten to dock his pay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite. What we discussed was our own business,&quot; Martin stated in a military manner, all business and taking the issue of order between the three quite seriously, &quot;All that matters is that he&#39;ll behave, he won&#39;t speak out of turn like that again, and---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can run off to bang local babes without needing to worry about him.&quot; Scottie chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Pretty much,&quot; the Roman said with a wry smile. He may have become more military minded and rather conscious of that, but his habits remained his own. &quot;He should be coming back shortly - had to take care of some business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some glances between the others in the group as they heard the sound of steel toed boots against the roadside. Looking down the road, it didn&#39;t take long to see Owen walking along. Calm, no longer showing that cocky sneer, but more looking focused. He looked relaxed to a degree, as if whatever business he took care of had taken something off his shoulders.<br />
<br />
Knowing what he did about the habits of guys like him, Lucky - in the midst of getting a new pair of his all too tight pants back on - asked Owen as he got in, &quot;Did ya have to run off to go jerk off or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nein, nein, I&#39;m---I&#39;m NoFap, like I told you a million times.&quot; But he said it in a tone that was far less committed, far less sure, less sense of believing his own lie. Owen then glanced at the two of them. Not a word though about the sexual stuff going on, even as Scottie didn&#39;t bother getting anything but his boxers on. As the four got back in their seats to continue their trek toward the meeting with Bruno Hartmann, Owen glanced around the van.<br />
<br />
Martin drove with his eyes focused wholly on the road, suffering no interruption to his driving. He announced as he drove, &quot;Our destination is a coastal castle-estate in Germany owned by Mr. Hartmann, called Drosstein. It shouldn&#39;t take too long to get there. But if you guys want, we could take a quick break by the roadside. There&#39;s a pretty nice lake on the way, so I hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scottie was habitually surveying the equipment that came with his new identity as a ninja - and making sure everything was in the &quot;proper&quot; place and order. Remembering a set up he had never learned until now.<br />
<br />
And Lucky looked proud of the sword resting at his feet, &quot;Man I&#39;ve gotta get in some practice with this thing soon...&quot;</p>
