<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mabel looked across the playground and saw her target, a 3 year old named Jeremy. He wasn't normally a part of <br />
the small group of children she normally cared for, but one of the workers called in sick that day and she <br />
ended up with him. He was the troublemaker of the daycare, throwing things around the room, pulling on <br />
people's hair, ripping the heads off soft toys, screeching like a banshee, never taking his nap, and so on. <br />
Even worse, his bad behaviour was starting to rub off on the other kids, ruining the happy demeanour they <br />
tried to show. Her fellow helpers had tried punishing him as much as they possibly could, but he just makes a <br />
game of it. They've even spoken to his parents about his behaviour but they won't believe that their precious <br />
little angel could do such things. It was time he learnt a lesson or two. She saw the perfect opportunity as <br />
well, as Jeremy was currently throwing sand at the other kids in the sandpit. She strolled up to him and <br />
sternly said &quot;Jeremy! What have we told you about throwing sand? I think somebody needs a time-out&quot;. She <br />
picked him up, ignoring his thrashing and his attempts to kick her, and carried him inside the daycare centre. <br />
She passed Elaine and asked her to cover for her kids while she taught him to be more mature. There was nobody <br />
else inside, everyone enjoying one of the few sunny days they got. She carried the squirming boy to the time-<br />
out square and he slumped onto the floor and curled into a ball. She whispered &quot;I wish Jeremy would age 5 <br />
years for every minute I decide to keep him in time-out&quot; and that jolt she previously felt occurred again.<br />
<br />
Jeremy groaned in pain as he started to grow, but he didn't say anything because he knew that Mabel would ask <br />
what was wrong anyway. He liked it when the day care workers paid attention to him. It's the main reason he <br />
acts out whilst there. He doesn't get much attention at home, not since his baby sister was born anyway. There <br />
was a loud rip as he grew out of his clothes and the pain disappeared. Yet he still continued to groan because <br />
Mabel hadn't done anything yet. After a minute, he turned to the woman who was watching him in amusement. &quot;Why <br />
aren't you helping me? I'm dying over here!&quot; he said in a dramatic tone.<br />
<br />
Mabel just smiled at the boy and said &quot;Oh you're certainly doing something, but it's not dying&quot;. Jeremy didn't <br />
understand, so he curled back up into a ball and started moaning again. Mabel wondered how he didn't notice he <br />
was almost 10 years older than before she put him in time-out. He was starting to look like a typical <br />
teenager, only without the clothes which hadn't withstood his growth spurt. <br />
<br />
She listened to him moan in fake pain for another minute before grabbing him by the shoulder. He turned to her <br />
and said &quot;No, you wouldn't pay att... Wow, why is my voice so deep?&quot;. He rubbed his throat, feeling a large <br />
lump where there was normally nothing. Maybe he was sick. He stood up off the floor, where he wobbled and <br />
stumbled on his much larger feet. He gasped, seeing he was now taller than the woman who wouldn't pay <br />
attention to him. Much taller, maybe even a whole foot difference. Having to look down to see her let him <br />
notice just how much he'd changed. His arms and legs were longer and hairer. His torso was toned and there was <br />
a wide line of hair around his bellybutton that led down to a thick patch of hair surrounding his manhood, <br />
which had increased tenfold. Hair was even starting to appear in the middle of his chest. It was all to much <br />
for him and he suddenly broke down in tears. &quot;Miss Andrews! I'm all big and hairy and I don't know why and I'm <br />
scared! What's happening!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mabel laughed at the new man. He had to be close to 20 years old now. &quot;Well as punishment for being such a <br />
brat, I decided to make you grow up. Maybe then you'll learn to be a mature, responsible member of society&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jeremy's mood brightened in an instant. &quot;You mean I'm a grown up now? Wow, this is so cool! I can do whatever <br />
I want&quot;. He rubbed the snot away from his nose, his hand brushing against his newly grown facial hair. He <br />
started rubbing his face with a dumb grin. She thought being a grown up would be punishment. Hah, as if! He <br />
was much bigger than his mum and dad now, possibly even older. He could drive, or stay up past bedtime, or <br />
watch those TV shows his parents wouldn't let him, or eat chocolate cake for breakfast. This was the greatest <br />
thing to ever happen to him.<br />
<br />
Mabel watched as the man explored his body, possibly closing in on 30 now. She could see his youthful face was <br />
starting to harden, and white hairs were popping up in the beard he kept rubbing. &quot;Well you might think it's <br />
cool now, but until you apologize to me, I'm not letting you out of time-out, and you wouldn't like that would <br />
you?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy laughed at the tiny woman. &quot;You can't keep me here. I'm a man now. I have a beard. Nobody stops grown <br />
ups from doing what they want&quot;. He reached a hairy hand out towards his cock, wondering why it was so hard and <br />
pointy, but Mabel slapped it away. She didn't want to see such acts performed in front of her, especially by a <br />
3 year old in a 33 year old body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but I can keep you here. I mean you're not going to stop getting older until you apologize to me, and <br />
according to my calculations, you are older than meeeeee... Now! So you can stop this while you're still sort-<br />
of young and handsome, or you can be stubborn and eventually stop when you're so old that you don't even have <br />
any teeth. It's your choice&quot;. He was definitely showing signs of aging now, a small patch of grey expanding in <br />
the middle of his beard and it looked to her that he was starting to loose his hair. Even his above average <br />
physique was starting to get softer with every passing second. Jeremy seemed to consider what to do before...</p>
