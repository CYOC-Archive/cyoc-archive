<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy fought his most basic urge to grow. As he saw Cray&#39;s massive pecs moving up and down as he breathed. The slight twitching and bouncing, and the vascularity his massive arms had. The bricked, heavy abs, pushing out his muscle gut, as beads of sweat ran down his whole body. Guy was also caught up with other urges that Cray set-off. <br />
&quot;Hey, bud? I think you should sit still here while I try to figure what we can do next, ok? I also have to go to the bathroom real quick. All the excitement had me forget that the beer we had just ran through me&quot;.<br />
&quot;Ok, that&#39;s cool. I&#39;ll just try and clear my head.&quot; Cray responded, while grazing his thighs as he could. <br />
Guy&#39;s attention drifted to that simple act, and he panicked. He now had to keep two urges at bay, and it was wearing him down. As he walked towards the bathroom his cock started twitching, as blood started flowing in, he felt his face warm up as the faint sounds of Cray moaning as he moved proved to arouse him. <br />
As he closed the bathroom door behind him, he saw himself in the mirror and took a deep breath, to then look down and notice the bulge in his pants get uncomfortably big. Just like any other time after the gym, except that now his fantasies were barking at him madly, now he couldn&#39;t escape from them or hide them. He got undressed, noticing his new, bigger physique: symmetrical, balanced, bulging and vascular. He could easily compete now, he thought, as he did a double biceps pose. The mounds of muscle pumped and striated, as roadmap veins went from his fits down to his thick forearms and peaked guns. He started thinking about Cray&#39;s growth, breathing in and flexing his abs. <br />
His cock, now fully hard, throbbing and leaking, distracting him from posing. He posed harder, moving to a frontal lat spread. As he expanded his back he thought about the clothes ripping off from Cray&#39;s body. How he wanted to put his hands on those lats. And thus, Guy&#39;s lats started spreading out, then his shoulders and then his thick, muscular arms. <br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; he muttered, &quot;fuck, i can&#39;t! I can&#39;t hold it off&quot; he stopped posing and started stroking his cock. The primal desire to grow, and his repressed need to feel Cray&#39;s body were too much. As he worked his shaft he wondered about it growing thicker, and longer, so with each stroke, he moaned and felt his body responding, and growing.<br />
His feet started widening and growing, as to lay the ground for more growth. Little by little seams from started ripping apart, and Guy could care less. He enjoyed  the sound of clothes, and every other thing around him shifting to accommodate to his growing size. <br />
He also knew that this time, he would cum fast. It was too much building up. His uncut cock was beet red, and veiny. His balls ached with all the cum he wanted to shoot. A couple more strokes would get him shooting fast. As he breathed in and out, his mind drifted back to Cray, his pecs growing, sweaty and big, and so Guy&#39;s pecs started filling out more. His nipples got hard as he felt his shoulders  push out more as pecs shelved over his cobbled, tight abs. His eyes now focused on how his cock was getting out of view due to his meat pillows shelving out, his nipples getting caressed by growing biceps.<br />
Cray once again entered his thoughts, the way his lips moved while he talked and smiled. How Guy wanted those lips on his, all over his body, doing all sorts of things. The thought persisted on and on, until the pressure of his urges overcame him. He shot his load trying to hold off the loud orgasm as to not disturb Cray. Muffling his moaning as best he could, but all that resistance made it all the more difficult to keep quiet, and he was tired of that too, so the next shot he let it out. <br />
&quot;Guy? Bro, what are you doing there?&quot; - asked Cray.<br />
Guy stood quietly, stroking his cock, knowing that he wasn&#39;t done. He gave in to a more basic side of him and he loved it. He shot again, for one last time, his cum covering parts of the sink and bathroom mirror. This last orgasm left him heaving, almost out of air. His whole body covered in sweat. <br />
He caught a glimpse at a scale in the bathroom. He wondered what the damage was while he grabbed a hand towel to wipe off excess cum from his semi-hard dick. As he got on, the scale took time but it flashed at 372 lbs. He was able to control his growth, despite it being difficult. <br />
&quot;Guy?! Dude!&quot; - demanded, Cray. Having an idea of what may be going on, but not daring to think about it.<br />
<br />
While Guy cleaned up his mess, Cray avoided thinking about what Guy was moaning about. His transformation brought up also his libido, as testosterone levels raised. He wondered though, about Guy. About how big he was down there; and what if Cray was bigger, what if his dick was bigger than Guy&#39;s. How big could his dick grow? And, he kept wondering about him having a foot long cock, and his balls being pretty big too. He kept wondering about that, and eventually the bulge on his shorts started to grow. The soft tissue expanding as he thought about all the guys he&#39;d seen at the gym too. About the glimpses he caught of thick and longer shafts, and how it feel for him to stroke something like that. Thick enough that his hands wouldn&#39;t be able to grab around, long enough to need his two fists. His legs shifted positions as he sat up. The shorts that had withstood all the growth he had endured before had started to meet their match. A slow rip at the side seems started happening, as the bulge began to look more lewd with each second. Cray was machinating how it would feel to be on top of someone with that massive foot long. How much he would shoot when he came. Would the tip be more sensitive, or the shaft? He started thinking also about asses. All the guys that he would see at the gym with their squat earned butts. How thick, and solid those bubble butts looked. And thus, he unconsciously gave himself a thicker, more muscular butt to go with his new hulking physique. <br />
<br />
With some effort, he tried to stand up. Rolling onto his side, and using what he could to hoist himself up he finally did, and his underwear went out with no effort once he stood; what rags were left of it hanging in between his tree-trunk thighs. He felt a heavy slap on his thighs, and he wondered a little scare what that could be, almost knowing what it was. He waddled over to the full size mirror, which could not hold that much of his now wide frame, and there it was: his new foot long cock. Flaccid swinging as he moved. As he admired his new achievement, the bathroom door creaked, as a massive guy made himself out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Guy, was completely naked, and still a little horny. But now his mind was made up about talking with Cray. He knew they had to have a talk, and whatever it was that came after he would deal with as it came - no pun intended. As he entered the living room he instantly got hard: Cray&#39;s massive physique, was standing in front of the mirror. Guy&#39;s eyes darted up and down, trying to capture every bit of what was in front of him.<br />
&quot;Cray, what happened?&quot; - Guy asked, as his cock throbbed a bit due to Cray&#39;s body.<br />
&quot;it&#39;s  a little embarrassing: I managed to get up. But I also got a little distracted...&quot; - Cray responded, while slowly turning to face him.<br />
&quot;What the fuck!? Cray... fuck... That&#39;s so...&quot; - Guy&#39;s mind started racing again. He couldn&#39;t control how much he wanted to feel Cray...<br />
Cray finally was able to turn around, and his foot-long penis was just semi hard. It looked massive, and Guy&#39;s cock responded by just getting as hard as a missile.<br />
&quot;Fuck! I can&#39;t take it. Cray! I want you! I want you now! I can&#39;t deal with this shit anymore! I want to feel your fucking pecs against my face. Make you flex! make you cum!&quot;<br />
As Guy let that out his cock throbbed harder and harder. His 10 inch uncut cock throbbed and leaked. Cray&#39;s body was now responding to all that. His foot long cock hulking in proportions. His pecs bouncing and his tongue licking his lips as his face blushed.<br />
Cray didn&#39;t say a word, he just slowly lumbered over to Guy. His cock getting harder as he felt his massive body moving and pushing things out of the way involuntarily.<br />
They stared at each other, and stood there. Their bodies were now closer together as they have always wanted. Muscles pushing against muscles. Sweat drenched bodies, heating up the whole place. One waiting for the other to make a move. Not one more willing than the other to kiss.</p>
