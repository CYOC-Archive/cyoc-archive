<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your heart jumped as you heard her offer. Could it be real? Could this beauty truly be yours to share? Was this all even really happening? As you considered her words, and evaluated how much you could trust your own senses, your thoughts were interrupted by the keen moaning of the amorous mermaids across the cove from you. You witnessed as the scarlet mermaid’s lips caressed the newest mermaid’s flesh lower and lower, one brush at a time until her flaming red hair vanished beneath the waves, and her amethyst partner dipped out of sight from behind her. You imagination quickly began to fill in the blanks as the topaz mermaid began clutching her and squeezing her bosom, cycling between tender caresses and harsh pinches of the hardened nubs atop her soft hills of flesh. You couldn’t deny, the more you saw, the more you desperately wanted to watch the action happening beneath the waves. Even more than that, you wanted to *be* the woman in the middle right now.<br />
<br />
“They do look pretty happy right now…” you admitted to the mermaid who currently had your full attention.<br />
<br />
“Oh. You don’t know the half of it, not yet anyway.” The mermaid tsked and reclined back, letting the waves lapping the shore. Her back arched and displayed more of her goddess like features above the water. Her slender digits festooned with translucent membranes, the fluttering fins on the sides of her head that took the place of human ears. “Swimming, singing, and sex. Those are the three ‘S’es of mermaid life. You’ll have many, many blissful days to enjoy all of them.”<br />
<br />
 You felt a cool rush stain your warm, begging lips below your clothes, the dampness slowly seeping into your undergarments. An image; a wonderful, wonderful image of the mermaid you were talking to wound body to body with you, a large single limb below your waist that felt foreign and yet so *right*. And of course, a moment of deepest passion about to transpire between the two of you… or maybe three. You shook yourself out of the daydream to get out a question. “Will I ever be able to go back if I say yes?”<br />
<br />
“Alas… no. The shift is permanent and the chance only comes once. If there’s someone you care for, though, we may sing for them to find us. Then it’s possible for the sea to bring you back together.”<br />
<br />
Another question sears through your waking mind, even as the need to go in the water became more and more primal. “Will it hurt?” You ask, not failing to notice the lightly suggestive tenor you delivered the question in. She leans forward, pulling more of her human half out of the surf. “Not in the slightest… this is a tender act, a gentle and sensual gift.” She offered her hand once more. “Have you any more questions? This is not a step to be taken lightly.”<br />
<br />
“What’s your name?” Was all you could think of.<br />
<br />
“Call me Miranda. And you?” The mermaid rose up on her tailfin to meet you at eye level, as you by now began to bend over to meet hers.<br />
<br />
“Camilla…” and as your name escaped your mouth, your hand grasped hers, and she pulled. For a slim looking woman, she was strong, she reeled you in as the cold ocean soaked your clothes and chilled your flesh to the bone. All was dark, you were lost underwater, and the only warmth was Miranda’s heat from her nude body which she now pressed into yours. <br />
<br />
You felt the crushing black of the ocean at night, the seeping chill of the depths, the lack of breath as you’re pulled below. For a moment, you dread to think you’ve been deceived, that these mermaids were vile flesh eaters, not the loving creatures they pretended to be. All those doubts were dispelled when Miranda’s soft lips collided with yours, and the lights all seemed to turn on again. Your eyes were rapidly repurposed to seeing underwater,  your lungs evolved in the space of a moment to suck in salt water and filter out perfectly breathable oxygen, and the frigid cold of the waves swept out with the tide, leaving the water warm, and unmistakably soft and silken. The waves themselves seemed to be pulling you into a motherly embrace, the ocean herself welcoming her newest daughter.<br />
<br />
Much less motherly and far more carnal, however, was the other creature embracing you. Miranda’s divine face was crowned in a halo of her own cyan locks, one webbed hand caressed your cheek, her thumb gently stroking your lower lip. Her other hand grabbed tight onto the hem of your cardigan, and lifted the shirt over your shoulders before tossing it down to the bottom of the sea. As she let more water grace your flesh, it made you crave it even more. Taking the initiative, you grabbed onto your skirt with both hands, and pulled it down with the panties in tow, losing the flip flops with them as they sank into the water. Allowing the water direct access to your flushed and excitable womanhood pushed you closer and closer to the tipping point. You curled your toes as bubbles bellowed from your mouth. <br />
<br />
Miranda’s voice, soft but commanding, reached your ears. “It feels good I realize, you no doubt wish to relieve yourself but you must listen to me… do not touch yourself at all. It is imperative that you not reach climax until the proper moment of your transformation.” She locked cyan eyes with your brown ones, a soft smile on her lips. “Can you promise me that?” <br />
<br />
You nod your head compliantly.<br />
<br />
“Good.” She kissed you once more. “Then sit back, allow me to do what must be done.” As her lips met yours for the third time, you felt a hum rumble from her mouth into yours, a powerful spell, delivered by sound directly into your body. It began to work immediately, you could tell your lips were rippling and molding like clay, shaping into a natural pout and a cute  Cupid’s bow. When they were done, you noticed how you could feel every curve and contour of Miranda’s luscious lips, as their use as receivers of touching sensation were magnified tenfold. Your cheeks flushed bright red as their bones rose high to frame a regal and refined looking visage. Your nose sloped into a petite curve, and your chin was shaped by the spell into a small curve, the mermaid used it to hold your head in place while spurring your change onward. <br />
<br />
Your eyes began to shine brightly, as your naturally brown irises glowed brightly, the hue changing to a lush shade of pink, foreshadowing the hair and tail that were to come. “Oh… that color will look good on you. See for yourself.” Cooed Miranda, breaking the kiss as her hand traveler from your chin to the back of your head, twirling a strand of your hair around one of her fingers and bringing it into your view. It was already the very same shade. You then noticed her words carried no distortion through the water, as you felt the sensitive fins that used to be your ears poking out of your wild new hairdo. The receptive organs flittered giddily in the water as you heard the full choir of the sea with a clarity you’d never known before. The fact that this soundscape included the other mermaids merrily fucking a few short yards away from you made it all the better. <br />
<br />
You sighed in bliss as you felt the wavy locks of your colorful mane now brushing past your shoulders and down your back. The hair coiled down your back like serpents, carrying the transformation down your body with them. The hair brushing your back activated the magic in your skin, from the along your spine first and spreading outward. The changing burnt away any trace of exéma or other skin irritation, leaving only soft, supple, well tended pale skin. And it was glorious, so very breathtaking. Your skin tingled and trembled softly with even the slightest touch. The mermaid’s warm body against yours felt good already, now it was downright orgasmic. The scales on her tail each felt hard to the touch, but no less warm and soothing as her human skin and silky hair were. You began exploring the scales along her slender waist, and pulled back as you watch your touch briefly interrupted her ritual. The sleight touch making the mermaid moan sensually this time. <br />
<br />
“Touching your scales felt good?” You questioned as the transformation advanced, judging by where the magic was about to march through your body, you were looking forward to it. <br />
<br />
“You’ll find out yourself soon enough Camilla.” She asserted as her lips kissed the nape of your slender neck, one now full of erogenous little secret spots. Down she went to your breasts, where the spell set its sights next. Your bosom began to shiver and strain under the bras you were still stuck in. It felt all the more constricting as your chest began to grow under duress from the garment. Miranda came to your rescue as she unhooked the bras, bearing your large, pink nipples to the cool water. Both her webbed hands cupped your breasts as they expanded to fill her palms. You arched your back in unprecedented pleasure as your hardened nipples were rolled and tugged and brushed by the webbing. Once they’d expanded to their full, heaving new size, the mermaid released them to let your chest touch hers. You sighed in relief as her chest nuzzled into hers, finding you fit each other’s bodies magnificently. Then you squeaked in surprise as you felt something unfamiliar, something pleasurable, like several more nipples lining the underside of your breast where it ran against Miranda’s skin.<br />
<br />
You looked down. It was scales, dozens of glittering pearly pink scales lining under your chest. They were spreading down your waist and arms, spreading out from your knuckles and bridging into a newly developing set of webbing. “Ah!” You gasped. “My scales?! Are they all?”<br />
<br />
“All of them.” She confirmed. “Tail and all.”<br />
<br />
“Wow…” you panted in amazement. “You were right… why would I ever want to go back?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly… but alas… you won’t have much choice if you can’t hold out for the final stretch of the change.” She pulled back, hold your webbed hands with hers. “You’ve been introduced to the pleasures of a mermaid’s body. Now you must give as well as receive. Take me, however you wish, and I will do the same. We must engender our passions to the point of climax, and by cumming as one, you will earn your tail.” She squeezes your hand. “Are you ready?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” You answered confidently. “But… you’re my first woman, let alone mermaid. How can I be sure I won’t be good enough?” <br />
<br />
She kissed you tenderly, making eye contact with you. “Just do what comes naturally. You already have the skills within you from the spell to give pleasure like an expert, you need only bring it out…” As she finished her sentence, you saw a cleft in her tail just where her scales and flesh met, revealing a wet and inviting slit that proffered out to the forefront, waiting for your touch…</p>
