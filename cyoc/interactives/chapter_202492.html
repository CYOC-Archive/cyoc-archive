<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The former Russian idiot in chief, now the handsome looking Russian wolfhound, laid at the edge of what had once been his Olympic sized pool. As a human, he had been a paranoid man, and after the Great Change, an even more paranoid woman. Incredibly stupid in some ways, incredibly shrewd in others. <br />
<br />
He had naturally planned contingencies for what would happen in the event that someone in the R.O.S.S tried to overthrow him. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Savannah and Katerina were in a hotel room in Norway, Katerina on top of Savannah, riding her. She groped Savannah&#39;s gigantic pillowy breasts, fingered her vagina, tickled her tummy(Savannah was extremely ticklish, one of her only weaknesses), and squeezed her ass, causing the radiant redhead to squeal out loud in a fit of giggles.<br />
<br />
All of her life, Savannah had always been the aggressive, manly partner in bed. When the Great Change happened, she had been forced to adapt her role, generally acting as the more submissive and traditionally feminine partner. She was still very tough and the best hand to hand fighter in the Occ-Ops, but her role more often than not when undercover was the flirty, mysterious ingenue, preying upon the prejudices of new women who had never completely gave up their masculinity, and the arrogance of born women who had become emboldened by the Great Change.<br />
<br />
She also enjoyed being more submissive when around Katerina. It was freeing, in a way to not always have to be the alpha.  <br />
<br />
That was why Katerina was briefly caught off guard when Savannah had very forcefully pinned her down to the bed. <br />
<br />
A split second later, sniper fire erupted through the window. If she hadn&#39;t reacted when she did, Katerina would have be shot several times in the spine. <br />
<br />
Savannah knew the vantage point where the sniper very likely was, but she didn&#39;t try to teleport there and turn the sniper into a toad. This was obviously a trap to seperate her and Katerina and capture either one or both of them. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Logan and Allison hadn&#39;t paid any attention to the news of Roe v Wade being overturned, nor any other news for the past week. They were simply having too much fun as young newlyweds on their (much delayed) honeymoon. <br />
<br />
They had decided to go on a road trip, playing things entirely by ear. Maybe they&#39;d try and visit every state, but they&#39;d probably just stick to the East Coast for now. <br />
<br />
Allison suggested maybe finding different landmarks in each city they visit to make love in.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Like maybe when we&#39;re in Connecticut, we could have sex behind the Mark Twain museum, and in Vermont, we can fuck behind a Ben & Jerry&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan cackled. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so silly, babe. I love that idea. Mark Twain?&quot; she asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
Allison shrugged her shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who doesn&#39;t love Huckleberry Finn?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t&quot; Logan croaked. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever read it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison blew a raspberry at her wife. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess it&#39;s a good time to put my Audible subscription to good use then.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned on the audiobook of Huck Finn on her phone, and the story began to play. <br />
<br />
They had just passed by their hometown in New Jersey, at headed towards New York. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Aziza and Kylie hadn&#39;t heard of the Roe v Wade Supreme Court decision either, but it didn&#39;t affect either of them anyway since Aziza was from Saudi Arabia and Kylie was an undocumented immigrant from another dimension. And the fact that if anyone tried to stop either of them from doing what they wanted with their bodies, Aziza would turn that person into a ladybug. <br />
<br />
Right now, the two girls were relaxing on a quiet beach together in their bikinis after a highly emotional afternoon. Aziza had shown Kylie a vision of their first meeting in the dilapidated remains of Glendale High. <br />
<br />
Not the entire encounter, Kylie wasn&#39;t ready to handle that, but just enough so she understood what was going on. Aziza had decided that the best strategy to help Kylie heal was reveal things to her slowly.<br />
<br />
 Kylie watched as she saw an emaciated, filthy, slightly younger version of herself stare at Aziza with a deranged look in her eyes. She screamed in primal rage and tried to blast Aziza with a wave of demonic magic.<br />
<br />
Kylie cried throughout the entire vision. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember ANY of this!&quot; she screamed. &quot;Stop it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;K&quot; said Aziza, and she snapped her fingers, sending them to the sandy beach where they now laid, hand in hand. <br />
<br />
That had been over two hours ago. Since then, the two had just sat together and made small talk. Anytime Kylie began to wallow in self pity, Aziza would change the subject to something else, like video games.<br />
<br />
Aziza secretly worried if she was helping things at all or just making things worse. <br />
<br />
Impulsively, Kylie grabbed Aziza and kissed her deeply. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would *never* hurt you&quot; she said as she pulled Aziza&#39;s bikini top off. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;See why I said that we should wait and see if we really want a baby?&quot; Regina said to Barry as they laid in bed together stroking each other&#39;s hair.  <br />
<br />
&quot;By law, if one of us miscarried through no fault of our own, and we were in say Oklahoma, we&#39;d end up in jail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barry nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s OK. Hopefully someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two talked about the news, and Barry wondered about the feasibility of the President packing the Supreme Court with progressive judges. <br />
<br />
&quot;Probably won&#39;t happen&quot; Regina said. &quot;The Democrats in Congress suck almost as much as the Republicans do, and they&#39;d sabotage any attempt at court packing because they are slaves to their donors. So much of this world is better now, but one thing that never went away is that politicians don&#39;t care about the little guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Waves and waves of women protested the decision in front of the Supreme Court in Washington DC.<br />
<br />
On the other side, police women watched in riot gear. <br />
<br />
One of the protesters, Hannah Buckworth, angrily threw a milkshake at a cop as Cat cowered behind her. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Elizabeth and Maria had a spirited argument on the way to church. Elizabeth was strongly pro choice, Maria strongly pro life. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth bit her tongue, not wanting to yell at the woman who had been so nice to her and was an object of stability in this rapidly changing world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you have aborted your beautiful children?&quot; Maria asked her. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I love Billie and Megan so much and I&#39;d die for them&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;But it was mine and Robbie&#39;s *choice* to have them. Women should never be forced to have children against their will. Can&#39;t you see that?&quot;</p>
