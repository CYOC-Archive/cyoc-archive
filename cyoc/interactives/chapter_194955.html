<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eleanor ultimately left school and walking home with her friends much differently than how she entered it; her perfectly straightened red hair and in its place was a curly mess tied up by two spiral pigtails. Her current wardrobe now consisted of dark brown wide leg and high rise Khaki pants with loose hanging suspenders on either side of her hips and a belt holding her pants up, exposing enough of her legs to reveal she was now wearing mathematic themed socks and a pair of velcro-sneakers, her friends said it was the best way to avoid the meathead jocks, airhead cheerleaders and just bullies overall from using her shoelaces as a weapon and to finish off the ensemble she was wearing a simple white and black striped t-shirt that was messily half-tucked into her pants<br />
<br />
Walking along side her new friends she carried two bags worth of a new wardrobe containing everything from new shirts, shorts, pants, socks and even underwear of different varieties, the underwear she bought in bulk for reasons she knew were awaiting her the next day at school and even when she got home, see although Elanor had told her new friends everything that she came from well off parents and even of the life she left behind coming to this new town and school, the one thing she kept hidden from them: She had an older sister: Rachel, who&#39;s relationship was rocky to put it best, they fought like cats and dogs but she was the one who was always blamed by their parents for starting the fights mainly cause they were under the misconception and belief that Rachel was the reason Elanor was an underachiever even though they both shared that problem it still ultimately led to animosity between the two and led them down two different lifestyle paths: Elanor still tried her best but Rachel adopted a more thuggish/punk attitude and style thinking if her parents saw her as a failure she may as well look the part and now that Elanor  was a helpless, weak little nerd she would be at her sisters mercy and she didn&#39;t want to get her new friends wrapped up in that<br />
<br />
As she and her friends made it to the front gate of her house Elanor turned to them &quot;Thank you for the assistance ladies I believe I can take it from here on&quot; was all Elanor said with a weak smile <br />
<br />
&quot;Ellie are you okay you have been silent the entire journey to our destination?&quot; Nerma asked concerned<br />
<br />
Elanor simply smiled &quot;I&#39;m fine Nerma just...contemplating how my decision will have an overarching consequence on my life now&quot; she said pausing for a moment &quot;How about we all gather together during our lunch time study session and I&#39;ll relay everything then?&quot; Elanor said<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that sounds like a plan&quot; Jeanette said in a sympathetic tone as she gathered up the other two to leave<br />
<br />
Elanor simply stood in front of her house waiting a little bit more time before walking into her house and making her way directly upstairs as she ascended the stairs more and more she could feel the rumbling  of music until she finally made it to the top of the stairs and could hear it in full glory: an unholy mix of rock, punk and metal blaring from her sister&#39;s bedroom, she slowly made her way over to the doorway where she was greeted by a sight that had become all too common for her; Rachel laying face up on her bed, reading a music magazine and her iphone, the source of the music resting comfortably on blaring that unholy musical mix Elanor talked about, adorning her sister&#39;s room was various rock and metal band posters typical of someone going through a phase as their parents chalked it up as, her comforter and pillows now a dark pink color with a black paint splotch line design running across the dark pink with a feminine skull marking in the center of said black paint splotch line, the final unmistakable part of her sister&#39;s room was the dirty clothes strewn about<br />
<br />
Rachel herself was in typical punk attire; ripped jeans, band t-shirt and a leather jacket hung up on a hanger she was the full stereotypical package. Elanor in this moment considered announcing her presence and asking where their parents were but considered it fruitless with the volume of the music and simply walked a little further down the hall to her own room to put away her clothes<br />
<br />
Of course unbeknownst to her Rachel did notice Elanor and looked up briefly to get a brief glimpse of her sister just as she walked out of view of the door frame &quot;Was that...Ellie?&quot; was all Rachel could say as she paused her music and quickly got up off her bed and walked out to the hallway seeing her now nerdified sister fiddle with her bedroom door before opening it. A malicious Smirk creeped across Rachel&#39;s face before licking her lips &quot;I&#39;m not sure what happened but our little rivalry just got deliciously more fun&quot; Rachel said nonchalantly walking to her sister&#39;s room<br />
<br />
As Elanor was busy multitasking between categorizing and organizing her old clothes while simultaneously swapping them out for her new ones in her dresser drawers, she was so engrossed in what she was doing she failed to notice her sister leaning against her bedroom doorframe with her arms crossed. Rachel for her part was trying her hardest to hold back from revealing her presence as she clasped an open palm over her mouth trying to stifle her laughter and taking in the sight her sister in the manner of a single day became one of the biggest nerds she&#39;d ever seen even more than the ones that she picked on in college<br />
<br />
Eventually Rachel gave in and the unmistakable bellowing laughter of &quot;HAHAHAHAHAHAHA&quot; was released startling Elanor who practically jumped out of her skin before turning to see her sister practically keeling over in laughter &quot;Holy shit Sis&quot; Rachel got out between wheezes of laughter &quot;What happened? Ya lose a bet? You trying out fir America&#39;s Next Top Nerd?&quot; she asked all at once<br />
<br />
It might&#39;ve only been some light teasing but Elanor already felt her whole body growing red from embarrassment &quot;NO!&quot; she yelled out in a loud childish tone before retreating into herself, rubbing her arm nervously &quot;Not that it is even any of your concern or interest as I wouldn&#39;t even expect you to understand but I just thought I&#39;d reinvent myself: New School, new life so I thought it was time for a new change and also...&quot; she stopped herself facing her sister with a more determined look &quot;Unlike you I actually wanna try this time to get good grades and not just settle for average, ones mom and dad can be proud of&quot; Elanor said  with her chest puffed out<br />
<br />
That struck a nerve with  Rachel who simply walked over to her sister with a malicious smile  on her face &quot;I Don&#39;t know if the bullies at your school have done this yet but I think it&#39;s time to break you in loser!&quot; Rachel said practically pouncing on Elanor <br />
<br />
&quot;EEP, NO! Leave me Alone!&quot; Elanor shouted ducking under her Sister&#39;s arms but quickly felt herself being dragged back <br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think your going Ellie Smelly!&quot; Rachel said as she had grasped onto Ellie&#39;s loose suspender straps, Ellie Smelly being the nickname every time Rachel did something extra disgusting to her sister<br />
<br />
Eventually finding herself pulled back into her sister&#39;s embrace Rachel repositioned Elanor into a headlock and began giving her a noogie &quot;AAGH Let me go Sister!&quot; was all Elanor could say as she struggled under her sisters grasp<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so our sisterly bonding time has only just begun but since I am kind enough not to ruin the neatly job you&#39;ve done in organizing your room lets continue this in my room&quot; Rachel said dragging Elanor headlock style into her room, Elanor struggling every bit along the way<br />
<br />
Upon entering her room Rachel quickly picked up a dirty sock from the floor before tossing Elanor onto her bed and getting on top of her &quot;Now shall we begin?&quot; Rachel asked maliciously holding the sock abover her sisters face<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Sis before we do this, before you completely subject me to the life of nerdom can I please make one request?&quot; Elanor asked pleadingly <br />
<br />
Rachel simply looking at her sister with a raised eyebrow &quot;Sure why not if nothing else I can keep a promise but make it quick&quot; she said sincerely <br />
<br />
Elanor simply gulped loudly before speaking &quot;From now until the end of time you can do whatever you desire to me but please leave my friends out of it, they already are gonna get hounded as it is by the bullies, jocks and cheer bitches at our school&quot; Elanor got out<br />
<br />
Rachel simply smirked &quot;Sure this El I can keep that promise&quot; she said stuffing the sock in Elanor&#39;s mouth gaffing her &quot;Now just where to begin?&quot; Rachel said out loud in a contemplative tone, tapping her chin &quot;Oh I know&quot; she said looking over Elanor</p>
