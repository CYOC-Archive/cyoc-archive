<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…that there was nothing underneath her coat!  other than the boots, which came to just below the knees, there <br />
was no article of clothing to speak of!  Needless to say, it did catch me off-guard, as I took a jerked step <br />
back from the shock of it.  Kasey’s only response, was to giggle slightly, with a smile on her face, as she <br />
strolled towards me, hands holding the coat open for me to see her body.  I could clearly tell that her body <br />
was as I remembered it, while the inside of her coat was lined with some soft, silky material, which I guessed <br />
would make it very easy on the skin.  <br />
<br />
“Truth is, I did want to tell you this for some time now.”  She began as the reached me, pressing herself <br />
against my body, so she must have felt my hardening cock against her.  “I’ve been something of a Home Nudist <br />
for a while now.  Hope you don‘t mind”  <br />
<br />
Any chance to reply, was cut off, as her lips met mine, with her arms around mine, and mine around hers, after <br />
a moment.  One arm over the coat, which was still on, the other under it, running over her otherwise bare <br />
back.  After some time passed, the lips parted, as I took in her face.  Once another moment had passed, she <br />
spoke again.  <br />
<br />
“Listen, I need to get a few things sorted.  Mind making us a hot drink each?  You know what I’ll have.”  <br />
<br />
“Not at all.”  I replied.  With that, she headed over where the sofa was, getting her coat off completely and <br />
leaving it on the armrest.  After which she headed back to the entry door, while I went into the kitchen area <br />
to make the drinks.  Knowing what she liked, I took the largest mugs that there were, and put in the drinking <br />
chocolate power, milk, and a whole lot of sugar.  Her personal preference for around this time in the day, <br />
well, night.  The Sun was almost down, and I could see that the snowfall was getting heavy.  That gave me an <br />
idea, just as Kasey came back around.  <br />
<br />
“Two minutes, gotta use bathroom.”  She told me, heading into the bathroom, granting me a great view of her <br />
splendid ass as it swayed ever so slightly with her every step.  <br />
<br />
Setting both mugs into the microwave to heat them, I made for the balcony windows to view the snowfall, before <br />
enacting on my idea.  <br />
<br />
“I wish that the snowfall would increase in intensity fivefold within the next ten minutes, and remain that <br />
way until the next sunrise, with the next day remaining overcast.”  I whispered, making the wish I’d formed in <br />
my mind.  Almost immediately, I thought I could see an increase in the rate of snowfall.  Something that would <br />
have to wait as I needed to check the drinks.  While warmed good, I gave them some more time to get them nice <br />
and hot.  Another minute being enough for them.  <br />
<br />
In fact, just as they finished, Kasey had made it out of the bathroom, while I gave the drinks a good <br />
stirring.  She strolled over to me, and set a finger to the side of one of the mugs.  <br />
<br />
“Mmm.  Just the way I like it.  So.  Wanna have it on the balcony?”  She queried.  <br />
<br />
“Uh, wouldn’t it rather cold out there, I mean the snow’s getting heavy now.”  Indicating to her that the <br />
snowfall was picking up its pace.  And the fact that she still only had her boots on, and nothing else.  <br />
<br />
“Ah, don’t worry about that.  It’s gonna take a while for the heaters to do their thing in here.  And besides, <br />
that’s why I left the coat out.”  Truth is, I’d forgotten that she’d left it by the chair.  “So give me a <br />
moment, and then get the mugs.”  <br />
<br />
She quickly made her way back around to where the front door was, but was back in seconds, with  a fresh set <br />
of gloves.  Made of thinner material, but as they went on, they came to her elbows.  I took that as a cue to <br />
get the drinks, as Kasey began to get her coat back on.  Once the arms were through the sleeves, she buttoned <br />
the inner three buttons on the right, well the design meant the buttons went through loops set out of it.  <br />
This as followed by the outer four on the left hand side.  <br />
<br />
Now that she was ready, we headed outside, where the snowfall was now intensifying.  Something that seemed to <br />
surprise Kasey.  <br />
<br />
“Whoa.  It’s getting heavy now.”  She stated as she pulled out a chair by the balcony table, which only had a <br />
pair of ashtrays on it, before sitting down.  I set her mug next to her as got another chair for myself as she <br />
took out a cigarette and lit it.  Inhaling the blueish smoke before letting it out in a strong stream.  <br />
<br />
Truth be told.  I had wondered whether or not to tell Kasey about the Ring and what it could do.  While there <br />
was certainly no need to alert her to what I accidentally did with the first wish, I could let her know about <br />
the weather.  On the other hand, there was no need to tell her, though that did feel a little dirty.  <br />
<br />
Should I?  Shouldn’t I?  That was the question…</p>
