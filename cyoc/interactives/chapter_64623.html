<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four friends laughed and giggled as young women tended to when they had nothing better to occupy their time. For these four friends the day didn't just mark the beginning of the weekend, but the beginning of a new, strange chapter of their lives. They had all graduated from high school and were now faced with their whole future spreading out before them. <br />
<br />
April was the only one looking into colleges, and only then because her family had money and expected her to go. Chastity already had a job lined up at the hair salon where her aunt worked. Bets had no clue what she was going to do, but she was going to have as much fun as she could, and Diane, well, she had no idea.<br />
<br />
At the moment all Diane could think about was the strange feeling that come over her at the mall, just for an instant it had been like an electric current had run through her. At the time it had happened so suddenly and passed so quickly that she had thought nothing of it, but now the feeling had returned, or at least partially returned. There was a strange feeling in her stomach, not entirely unlike cramps and an intense tingle had started between her legs similar to the pins and needles feeling she got when one of her feet fell asleep. She wasn't sure why she connected those sensations with the feeling that had come over her at the mall, but she did.<br />
<br />
Her friends noticed her silence and asked what was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, just thinking,&quot; she said, not wanting to make an issue of things since she was clearly the only one getting the feeling, the only one who had noticed the ominous way the fat man had stared at them.<br />
<br />
She tried to keep up with the conversation her friends were having, but it was difficult, even when the tingling began to fade.<br />
<br />
It came as a relief when the bus finally reached her stop and she got off quickly, saying her goodbyes and promising her friends that they would get together again the next day.<br />
<br />
Walking seemed to help and by the time she had gotten halfway to her house the tingling and not-quite cramps were mostly gone, the cramps faint enough to be easily ignorable and the tingling replaced by an odd pressure, that soon became uncomfortable, especially across her pussy and clit. It almost felt like her panties had become too tight. Looking in all directions to make sure that no one was watching, she slipped a hand down the front of her jeans to adjust her panties and it the process brushed her fingers against her clit, which sent a pleasurable shudder running through her.<br />
<br />
Despite her best efforts her adjustment attempt only served to increase the feeling of pressure, especially at her clit, which she could now feel rubbing against the silky fabric with every step she took. Intense pleasure soon replaced the discomfort she felt as her clit was stimulated by the very act of walking.<br />
<br />
By the time she got home she was flushed with arousal. Luckily neither of her parents had gotten home from work yet so she was able to rush up to her room to deal with her problem. As soon as she had the door shut behind her she was unbuttoning her fly and pulling down the zipper of her jeans. Looking down she expected to see that her panties would be soaking wet with her feminine juices, which they were, but she could also see the outline of her clit where it was pressed against her panties.<br />
<br />
Hurrying to her room she made sure to lock the door just in case her parents got home earlier than expected, and then pulled off her jeans and panties letting out a gasp at what she saw.<br />
<br />
Her little pink button was proud and erect, the tip visible sticking out from the little hood of skin that normally covered it which made it look bigger than normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; she gasped as she reached down to caress it with her fingers and was rewarded by a jolt of pleasure. Whatever was going on, it had her more horny than she had ever felt before.<br />
<br />
Letting her fingers move a little farther back she let them slide between pussy lips and into her plush slit, prompting a gush of pussy juice to flow out of her.<br />
<br />
Dropping to her hands and knees she fingered herself, using some of the lubrication from her pussy to moisten her clit for added stimulation when she teased it, her perky breasts heaving with every gasp of pleasure she let out. By alternating between attending to her pussy and clit she soon found a rhythm that worked to drive her to greater and greater heights of pleasure, especially when she played with her clit. It didn't take long for her to reach climax, the orgasm that wracked her body seemingly centered around her clit.<br />
<br />
Spent, she collapsed to the floor in a state of bliss from the best orgasm she had ever experienced. Not even sex with her boyfriend could compare to what she had just felt.<br />
<br />
Still basking in the afterglow she got to her feet and went to the bathroom to clean off the juices that were rapidly drying on her thighs. As she blotted herself dry she noted that her clit, despite once again being covered by its hood, still looked unusually large and perky. Then again, she had never really paid much attention to her clit or looked that closely at it, so it might have been her imagination. Either way, she saw no reason to worry, the orgasm she had just experienced proving that everything was in proper working order.<br />
<br />
After she was clean and dry she put on a fresh pair of panties, and she blamed the pressure she felt on the fact that her clit was still sensitive from her orgasm.<br />
<br />
Not thinking any further on the matter she put on her pants and went to the living room to watch TV.<br />
<br />
There was nothing on but reruns, but she was looking to kill time until dinner more than she was looking to watch anything interesting. Since there was nothing good on she went to her room to get her ipod to listen to music while she flicked through the channels. None of the shows caught her interest and none of her music seemed all that great.<br />
<br />
&quot;So boring,&quot; she complained to the empty house, &quot;School's over for good now and I can't go to the beach. Stupid Bets getting in trouble like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of the girls, Bets was the only one with a car, or at least she had been until her parents caught wind of the fact that she had been skipping school to drive to the mall or the beach or to go and catch a movie with her friends. Her parents had taken away her keys and told her that she wouldn't be getting them back until the school year was over. The only reason they had all gone to the mall that day was because Bets wouldn't get her car back until her parents got home that night. They had all agreed that the instant Bets got her keys back they were all going to the movies to celebrate, even if there wasn't anything good playing.<br />
<br />
Diane glanced at the clock and let out a disgusted sigh, it was barely four o'clock, meaning that Bets' parents wouldn't be getting home for another hour, at least and after that she would have to eat dinner with her family, meaning that the four friends wouldn't be getting back together for at least two hours, maybe more. Afterward though they'd probably go to Chastity's house since her mom was cool and never complained if they stayed up all night and made noise, hell, Chastity's mom would even get them beer as long as they promised not to get too drunk. Bets' parents could have learned a lot from Chastity's mom. Sometimes Diane wished that her own parents could be more like that.<br />
<br />
Bored and frustrated she continued to skim through the channels on TV, hoping that something would catch her eye, shifting uncomfortably as she did so in an unconscious effort to alleviate the growing pressure at her groin.<br />
<br />
Eventually she settled into a pattern of flicking back and forth between a rerun of Jersey Shore, wishing that her life could be more like the world of nonstop shopping, beach trips and parties that the people on the show lived in, and a documentary about wild horses on the nature channel. When she had been little she had always wanted a horse, a fantasy she had outgrown quickly enough, gaining more mature interests like shopping, parties and boys. Watching them on TV she could easily recall why she had liked them so much, with their sleek muscular bodies, flowing manes and tails, and their amazing strength and beauty when they ran.<br />
<br />
Soon she had settled on watching the horse documentary, which if nothing else, helped pass the time.<br />
<br />
When her mom came home half an hour later she was still watching the show about horses, sitting on the couch with her legs spread open.<br />
<br />
Tired and short tempered from work her mom rolled her eyes, &quot;Diane don't sit like that, it's not lady like!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see you too mom,&quot; she snapped back, but did as told, wiggling slightly at the discomfort that came with the action of crossing her legs. <br />
<br />
No longer distracted by the TV she realized that the cramps she had been feeling had gotten worse, settling lower down in her stomach. Pulling out the earbuds of her ipod she called out to her mom, &quot;What's for dinner anyway? I'm hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're that hungry fix something for yourself,&quot; her mom replied sharply, &quot; You're old enough to take care of yourself and I've had a long day at work. Just for once it would be nice if you fixed dinner for a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, whatever,&quot; Diane muttered, getting up from the sofa and stomping into the kitchen to search through the freezer for a TV dinner to heat up. Cooking wasn't something she'd ever been interested in, she hadn't done it before and she had no intention of starting now.<br />
<br />
She sat in the kitchen, brooding and rubbing her aching stomach as the seconds counted down on the microwave.<br />
<br />
The instant the dinner was done she grabbed it and a fork and stormed into her room, locking the door behind her. If her mom was just going to get on her case like that then she was going to ignore her and wait for a call from Bets.<br />
<br />
As she ate she fidgeted, the discomfort of her cramps matched by the way it felt like her clit was being crushed by her panties. Even her pussy hurt, if such a thing was possibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid mom,&quot; she hissed, tossing her fork aside and standing to to try and adjust herself, &quot;When she did the wast she screwed up and shrank my underwear and my nice ones too. Why does she have to screw everything up?&quot;<br />
<br />
She unzipped her jeans, intending to take her panties off and find a pair that hadn't been ruined, but the instant she was able to see her panties she froze. Even without taking her panties off it was obvious that her clit was bigger, she could see it clearly outlined against the stretchy pink fabric. There was even a bit of a bulge below it where her pussy lips were.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; she gasped, poking at the lump of her clit and shuddering. It was just as sensitive as before and responded to the touch. Diane could actually see it growing and straining against the fabric of her panties.<br />
<br />
Her growing fear doing nothing to kill the arousal she felt, she stripped off her panties and looked down at herself. Her pleasure button, normally small and pink and grown and changed in color, becoming longer, thicker and slightly darker in places. The hood that normally covered it had also grown and acquired dark patches, the soft wrinkled flesh having smoothed out slightly. More than that, its orientation had changed so that it pointed upwards toward her rather than down. Below it she could see her pussy lips hanging down, also darker in color. With a shaking hand she touched them and found that they had fused together into a sort of fleshy sack, leaving her with no opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she whimpered, &quot;I'm a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say something honey?&quot; her mom called out from her own room.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Diane shouted back, trying to keep her voice even. The last thing she wanted was for her mom to come barging in and see that she had turned into some sort of freak with a huge clit and no pussy.<br />
<br />
She continued to grope her pussy lips, feeling the leathery flesh and searching for an opening that was no longer there, all the while the strange cramps she had been feeling dropping lower and lower until with an odd straining sensation and an intense buildup of pressure that nearly brought tears to her eyes there was a popping sensation and the feeling of something dropping, rapidly followed by an identical feeling and she could feel something in the sack between her legs. The pressure was gone, as were the cramps, leaving nothing more than the memory of discomfort. When she took her hand away she could see that the sack now contained two objects hanging side by side, each no larger than a grape. It looked just like she had grown a pair of balls which prompted her to take a closer look at her clit.<br />
<br />
Fear had finally managed to kill her arousal, causing her clit to retreat into its hood, but she was able to pull the skin back with her fingers and see that there was a small slit on the top of her clit, making it look like a miniature penis, but it's orientation was all wrong, laying along her belly rather than flopping down. It looked more like something that she would have expected to see on a person than on an animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No! No!&quot; she cried, throwing herself across her bed and burying her face in her pillow. Laying as she was, she could feel her new penis pressing against her sheets. Disgusted she rolled over onto her back, shaking wildly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can't be happening!&quot; Diane moaned, trying not to make so much noise that her mom would hear her.</p>
