<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mathew stopped and heaved a deep breath. A quick glance back and he watched his younger brother, Tobias, slip on something. A grinned crossed his face and he thought bitterly, &quot;Would serve him right after what he did,&quot; and looking away, he gazed about the forest, searching for a clue as to whether they were near the edge.<br />
<br />
It had been Tobias&#39; idea that they go hiking and camping in Aokigahara over spring break. And, at first, Mathew wasn&#39;t so sure, as the name, The Suicide Forest, just sounded too creepy. But, as the time approached, and he didn&#39;t have any other plans, Mathew finally relented and began preparing for a week in Japan, demanding from his brother that if they were to do this, it would only be for three days tops. Tobias agreeing, the two brothers, each feeling a excited about what they might see and take away from what they perceived as their adventure, got what they needed in record time to travel, with most already in their possession, as each had already planned study abroad at some time.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving in Japan, they decided to visit Aokigahara first and set about preparing, buying the necessary camping equipment, obtaining any permits they might need, making sure they had the appropriate amount of food and water, then, after taking a bullet train, they set out. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one big fiasco. The first day had rained and they were confined to the tent for most of the time. This led them to discover that the majority of the food they packed, all vacuum-sealed, had somehow spoiled, which reduced the amount of time to could spend camping. Then, to cap things off, sometime in the night, someone stole nearly everything they had brought with, leaving them with a tent, barely any food, two sleeping bags and the clothes on their back.<br />
<br />
Curious to know how it had been possible for someone to enter their tent whilst they slept, Mathew adjusted his pack and started to gaze back at Tobias. But, still not wanting to speak to his younger brother, he instead changed tactics and pretend to continue peering about. As the 23-year-old young man drew within a couple steps of his older brother, Tobias stopped and scowled at the 25 year-old and thought angrily how it was all Mathew&#39;s fault.<br />
<br />
Secretly, he knew that hiking and camping in the Aokigahara forest had been his idea. But, at the same time, he blamed Mathew for everything, believing it was all his older brother&#39;s fault that they were lost, as he was supposed to protect and look out for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;After all,&quot; Tobias reasoned to himself. &quot;It was Mathew who helped me decided to go to the same University as he planned to attend. It was Mathew who hooked me up my girlfriend, Bria. It was Mathew who was there to assist me when I had trouble with something. And now, it is Mathew who has gotten us lost and is responsible for most of out stuff getting stolen,&quot; and glaring at his brother and the one pack, Tobias thought how much he despised him.<br />
<br />
After a moment, trying hard to ignore the look his brother was giving him, Mathew turned away and began walking. Following close behind, but at the same time allowing himself to fall a bit further back, Tobias was tempted to ask how much further. But, deciding against, he kept his peace and instead started looking about, searching for something familiar that would tell him they were almost of.<br />
<br />
Everything about the forest looking the same, Tobias soon gave up and resigned himself to walking with his head down and only glancing up to make sure he was still following his brother. In front of him, listening to his brother&#39;s footsteps, Mathew found himself wanting to tell Tobias to walk quieter or, if he had to make so much noise, he should start doing something else. &quot;Something to help draw attention of some people,&quot; he thought bitterly. Looking up, he thought he saw what looked like a cabin off some ways, but didn&#39;t think it was right. Drawing closer, he soon saw that it was in fact a cabin and stopping, he wondered if there was somebody living in the forest.<br />
<br />
Tobias, his vision still averted downward, did not realise Mathew had stopped. Upon abruptly running into him, he looked up and was about to snap, &quot;Why don&#39;t you look where you&#39;re going,&quot; but lost his confidence when he saw not only his brother glaring back at him, but also the cabin.<br />
<br />
Curious, certain that it meant they were saved, Tobias almost asked about the building. But, before he could, Mathew turned away from him and started toward the building. Following a couple steps behind, Tobias watched as his brother approached the building, which Tobias thought looked out of place in the Aokigahara forest and that it looked more like something you&#39;d find in an American or European setting. His brother starting to knock, then hammer on the door, Tobias shivered as he thought something was off.<br />
<br />
About to comment, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; he was taken by surprise when Mathew reached out and opened the door.<br />
<br />
Never before had Tobias thought his brother would do something as entering somebody else&#39;s house without permission. Yet, here he was, pushing open the door of someone&#39;s cabin, calling out, &quot;Hello? Is anyone home?&quot; then entering, calling out the same thing again as he stepped over the threshold.<br />
<br />
Unsure, the willies he was feeling about the cabin growing, Tobias crept forward and peered in. Staring at a nicely furnished living room, he again felt like something was off. Glancing over at his brother, he whispered, &quot;I don&#39;t we should be doing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
His already frayed temper finally snapping, Mathew glared back at his brother. Shooting daggers, he huffed, &quot;Yeah? Well I think you act like nothing more then a teenage girl a lot of the time. A teenage girl who needs her big brother to always look out for her,&quot; and dropping the pack to the floor, he crossed his arms and glared defiantly at his brother, silently daring the 23 year-old to say or do something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Tobias finally belted out and starting breath heavily, he considered marching into the cabin and decking Mathew. Instead, he spat out, &quot;You&#39;re nothing more than a bitch,&quot; before turning around and storming away.<br />
<br />
Mathew, watching his brother stomp back the way they&#39;d come, considered going after him. Instead, he shouted, &quot;Good riddance. I don&#39;t need to be burdened with someone like you. I&#39;ll find a phone here, call for help, then, if they ask, I&#39;ll not tell then anything about my sister wandering around,&quot; before stalking toward the door and slamming it as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
Outside, Tobias barely heard what his brother shouted before slamming the door. As felt he sting of tears coming to his eyes, he considered turning around and going back to apologise. Instead, angrily brushing the tears away, he muttered, &quot;Bitch,&quot; before continuing on. Figuring that he would find a way out, but wouldn&#39;t tell anyone about Mathew, he looked up, got his bearings and choosing a new direction, one he thought would take him in a southeast direction, he started walking.</p>
