<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You spent the rest of the day on your bed. After getting so close to finally getting an orgasm and being denied it, you felt awful. It felt like all the motivation needed to carry out the day was gone. Especially so since Clia wasn&#39;t by your side this time.<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and hoped that this whole merman thing would end.<br />
<br />
The next time you opened your eyes, you could feel scales gently wrapping your tail and a soft set of terms embracing you. You turned to see Clia right by your side again. <br />
<br />
You couldn’t help but smile as you saw her again. You still couldn’t believe that you managed to form a relationship with a girl that last beyond a couple late night stands, let alone a mythological creature with a fish tail instead of legs. <br />
<br />
But as you looked at her tantalizing body, you realized something felt… off. Not with Clia, of course, but it felt like you were missing a reaction that your mind used to do when you looked at her body. It took a few minutes of pondering, but the realization eventually sit in.<br />
<br />
Your brain wasn’t on fire with the memory of a raging hard-on anymore. <br />
<br />
It seemed impossible. It felt like just moments ago you were trying to masturbate so your half-fish body would finally respond with your brain on getting an orgasm. Now it seemed even your brain wasn’t working right for some reason.<br />
<br />
 You wondered how long you were out for. It looked like it was it was night time with how dark the sea looked. But you could still hear noises coming from the kitchen where you and Clia’s family would eat fish. You swam out of your seabed to find one of Clia’s sisters cleaning the kitchen. She smiled warmly as you approached her.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s so good to see you! I haven’t seen you up in a while. I thought you were seriously ill.” She said in a soothing voice.<br />
<br />
“Hey. Umm… Could you tell me how long I was out for?” You asked weakly.<br />
<br />
The eyes of Clia’s sister showed a sense of sympathy. “You were out for two days. You must’ve been worried sick about Clia.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened. Two days? Christ. You couldn’t believe it at first, but then you look down at your tail to remember that you were a human turned merman because of a starfish. Nothing was too impossible at this point.<br />
<br />
But then it still leaves the question of why your brain isn’t currently releasing those powerful and intense signals that signaled you that you were living with naked mermaids at this moment.<br />
<br />
It was then that you remembered something.<br />
<br />
It was almost a year ago, back when you were trying to do something about your sex and porn addiction as a human and browsed these “NoFap” boards on your computer late at night.<br />
<br />
Of course, those boards would eventually be useless for you as you continued making love to all kinds of women and consuming porn like candy, but you could remember browsing through a thread regarding NoFap streaks.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, once you go over two days of habitual masturbaitng, your brain’s desire for finding porn and releasing an orgasm would decrease, and the desire would only go down further as the days go on.<br />
<br />
It was also discussed on the board that the first 48 of porn abstinence was always the hardest period - and you just went through it by sleeping for over two days straight. <br />
<br />
Clia’s sister saw the puzzled look on your face and spoke. “You’re probably wondering where Clia went.”<br />
<br />
The mermaid showed you all kinds of seafood that were contained in a huge net. “Clia was hunting food for the kids you two would have. Mermaids lay quite a decent number of eggs, so it’s a good call for her to be thinking ahead like this.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened again. The mating. It’s tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow, you were finally going to get an orgasm!<br />
<br />
That thought excited you, both emotionally and sexually. You could feel some of your horniness coming back as you thought of finally jizzing for the first time in what felt like forever.<br />
<br />
Of course, you would be orgasming on eggs, which still sounded strange to you. But who knows? It would definitely beat aimlessly touching your groin for a failed orgasm.<br />
<br />
Clia&#39;s sister could see the hope in your eyes and quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you were trying to masturbate a couple days ago. I could smell the pheromones that were coming from your room while my sister was gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
You blushed hard upon hearing that, but you could still see the mermaid&#39;s smile still remaining with no hidden malice to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s OK. I actually saw Eric trying to do the same thing not too long ago. Unlike you, he doesn&#39;t know that merfolk mating starts tomorrow. He&#39;s going to be missing out.&quot; She said with a giggle.<br />
<br />
Immediately, you felt a wave of vindication crashed over you.<br />
<br />
After almost a week of suffering, it would all be worth it to see to see Eric&#39;s  face when he sees you as a merman father. <br />
<br />
You thanked Clia&#39;s sister for the emotional help and excitedly swam back to your seabed with your mermaid.<br />
<br />
You gently joined her sleepy embrace and started to fall asleep with her.<br />
<br />
Before you fell asleep, however, a thought hits you.<br />
<br />
Once you mate with Clia and she lays her eggs - You&#39;ll be a father and there would be no turning back. <br />
<br />
Even if you somehow found a way to be human again and escape, you would not only be leaving a mermaid behind, but also merchildren - Your children.<br />
<br />
You might&#39;ve been a sex explorer as a human, but you weren&#39;t ignorant to the pain people face with no father in their lives, especially with some of the women you met on your sexcapades.<br />
<br />
Parental abandonment is bad enough on land, the thought of you doing it at sea was frankly disturbing.<br />
<br />
You embraced Clia more tightly. <br />
<br />
Whatever happens. Tomorrow was going to be a big day.</p>
