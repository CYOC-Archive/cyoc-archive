<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Graxellia pondered her situation, leaning towards removing the church and cutting into the Goddess power, with her whole nation heaping praise, Graxellia felt in influx of power from the worship. Even still, she was at best a planetary deity short of a full planet, the goddess of this world was a universal one, ruling this whole reality as the god of your old world was for it. While the Goddess seemed strangely limited in her world, her power could be the brood goddesses greatest threat. With this in mind, Graxellia was about to issue the commands, when a strong presence made manifest in her mind,<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to me,&quot; <br />
<br />
Eyes widening, Graxellia turned in the direction <br />
of the demonlord, somethingwas  calling her there, something  beyond ancient and powerful.  Graxellia stood and lead her armies as she strutted off towardsthe  continent of demons. Arriving  at the shores of her kingdom, Graxellia simply walked atop thewaterr, every step the waves behind her becoming a multi-colored monster filled ocean. Her army following behind, her power keeping them all able to walk across the water. <br />
<br />
Reaching the  other shore, the demon armies tried to fight back, but were easily swept up in the changes. Most did not change much, becoming more monsterous, a few swapping genders, but each in the slut Goddesses presence became eternally loyal. Not too long, Graxellia hadarrived  at the demon kings palace, however, when she arrived, the demon king was not as she expected. The large demon monster seemed listless, he barely looked up from his throne before limply accepting his fate. As the golden light passed, he experienced the most change, becoming a brain dead bimbo demon bunny girl morph with massive tits, broodmother impregnation rate, and strapped to a ornate free use harness that use to be his throne. It was as if whatever powered this being simply abandoned it, leaving and empty husk. Graxellia pondered what could have happened, until she felt that pull, deep within her, coming from the wasteland behind the demon kings castle. <br />
<br />
Compelled, Graxellia order her people to stay behind, having a feeling that she need to go alone, even temporarily willing herself not to give constant birth, as uncomfortable as that felt for her to do. Strutting, she made her way into the demon waistes, with barely any life within, even that life shifted to her realm as she walked. However, she eventually reached a deep chasm, with a single massive stone  path leading down into a dark abyss. She walked the path down, but noticed as she did, her storm did not follow, as if her power was suppressed her. With trepidation she pressed on, walking through the darkness, her godly nature allowing her to still see.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she passed a strange stone threshold, and came into another place entirely, but it was no simple room. All around her was the black void of space, stretching on for eternity, with only a stone platform leading from the threshold. But the void did not concern Graxellia, no, she was to focused on the litteral eldritch being before her. It was monolithic, easily surpassing the size of a sun, and currled into a ball. It was an amalgamation of chitin, fur, fin, feather, spike and wing, forming a massive celestial monster, with the torso of a woman of such beauty to equal if not surpass Graxellia. That torso looked to be asleep, as the whole body was wrapped in a massive spell circle of incalculable complexity, Graxellia knowing it as godly magic. This thing was ancient, massive, and more powerful than Graxellia could hope to match, she was a planetary goddess, the goddess of this world was closer to universal, but this thing was easily multiversal, Graxellia, for all her new forund power was but an ant to a giant in comparison. As she looked, the female torso opened its eyes and stared at Graxellia , their shared divity allowing her to understand who and what this creature was. <br />
<br />
In the beginning, at the birth of the first deities, there were twin goddesses, lovers who helped shapped the cosmos. But, as time started to move, the two became devided in purposes and power. One focused her essence through order and light and became the goddess of this world. The other, embraced intrinsic chaos, molding and shapping her form in pervese ways as chaos power flowed through her. The goddess of this world brought order and made humans, while the Goddess of chaos traveled the multiverse, devouring and fornicating with whatever powers she could find, and seeded the multiverse with monsters. In time, she became too powerful and the deities as a whole couldn&#39;t  contend with her, thus they set a trap. They ordered her sister to help bind her, the goddess of chaos may have been more powerful, but her sister held an intrinsic link to her sisters essence, with that they bond her into this void. The goddess of this world was tasked with maintaining he sisters prison, which is why she kept her universal power n locked onto this world. Over time, a tiny fraction of the chaos goddesses  power leaked from her prison, allowing her to empower one specific monster, the demon lord, to stike back at her sister, and free herself. But countless demon lords have risen and fallen, and she lost hope, her one thought being finding freedom, no matter what that ment. Then came Graxellia, or alec as she once was, there was a reason the goddess of this world abandoned all her duties to head to earth, to the only being who could  remove the power of possession, for with it came her potential freedom. <br />
<br />
Initially, she had tried to reach out to him, but he was too weak to hear her call, so she waited till he go more powerful, she would lead him to her prison and trick him into using possession, then overpower his spirit a3nd free herself. However, alec moved to fast, and as the deity Graxellia, her being was far too powerful  for that, Graxellia may be an ant in comparison to her power, but she was still a goddess, that came with some benefits. With that, there was only one choice, if she coukd not take, she would give, reversing her will and allowing Graxellia to subsum her completely. In a way, this ment death, but at least her essence would be free. <br />
<br />
Graxellia, after taking this all in, bowed to this primordial goddess of monsters, in honor of what she was, and respect for what she wanted, then looked her in the eyes and said, <br />
<br />
&quot;Possession,&quot; <br />
<br />
A massive Cracking noise filled the multiverse, somewhere, in thr heaven of earth&#39;s reality, a gorgeous, but but visibly pissed of goddess was beating the shjt out of earths god, before feeling the very multiverse shutter, and trembling in terror. In the grand celestial council of deities, all debate halted as dread filoed silence filled the room, as a voice rang out into the cosmos <br />
<br />
&quot;Once, a small mortal, now I surpass the gods,&quot; <br />
<br />
In the black emptiness of the void, outside all existence, floated an cosmic colored egg, dwarfing all of creation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once an impotent male, now the essence of decadent perversion,&quot;<br />
<br />
A crack grew along the side of the egg, as multicolored light shined out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once, a small solitary soul, now the mother of all creatures,&quot; <br />
<br />
The cracks grew as from the bottom shot out tendrils, from the crack on side came one eye, looking into the multiverse with one solitary eye, befor countless opened around it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I am the mother brood, sex in form, the all and one,&quot; <br />
<br />
The egg shattered as a light filled creation, <br />
<br />
&quot;I AM CHAOS!!&#39; <br />
<br />
The being that emerged held 4 long ruby colllored tails, tipped in ornate, golden metal like bone platings that shapped into 4 ornwte organic bells. The each slithered up and merge into a long serpent like body, literally thicker than the diameter of the multiverse and so large and long to twist and shift around the vast eternal void. The skin of the serpent was an ornate, Mastercraft menagerie or golden plasma like fur and feathers, ruby metallic scales and skin, chiten, and decorated in all kinds of  fins fur and spikes. One central feature were four massive fin like wings that tappered down each tail and lead across the masive body, golden fur and feathers lined the inner webbing Across the length of the body where largr dragon like arms, as well as a menagerie of other monsters limbs that orderly lined its body. At the head was a cobra like hood, trimmed in massive ornate spikes and covered in the back with a large mane of fur and feathers. And in the middle of the hood was a the most sinfully beautiful woman in creation. She was connected to the hood from her back, from her tailbone, acros the back of her shoulders and neck, and up the back of her head, the top of the furred hood acting like her hair. The inner lining of the hood was also fured, acting and looking like a vertical cushion for her to lay on. Her torso was slightly elongated, but her  was still inhumanly beautifully shapped, with massive curves and a tiny waist, giving the image of a soft, enticing form. Her skin was a deep chocolate brown, lined in bright glowing golden tattoo like markings that looked like their were made of liquid starlight, shapped in primal, tribal, and slutty designs. Her ass and hips where mind boggling big on her frame, yet blended perfectly with her shape, and tiny waist. Her face was beautiful, shapped like a masterfully crafted mask, colored in ornate markings that pooked cermonial, as her lips where the same glowing color, showing of the perfect, super inflated, pouty shape. <br />
<br />
Those where the only really recognizeible humanoid traits she had, as the rest portrayed  her monsterous essence. From both sides of her head and down to her shoulders where multiple identical faces  that blended into the hood. On the central forhead was an ornate series of bonynplates that matched her skintone, covered her eyes and connected across other faces, looking like a large complex mask for her upper faces. In the area of her eye lides were countless beautiful, crystal like eyes and naturally shifted colors in a unique, ordered pattern and each with ornate, beastial irises. They lined the bone plates like ornate decorations across on her faces, making a sea of ordered, jem like eyes. Her teeth were each ivory glowing white spikes, as each of her mouths had long serpant like tounges. Across her shoulder line  where an asortment of gilded gills that acted like a regal necklace. <br />
<br />
Her hands and feet where long but danty, ten digit claws, covered in and asortment of ornate ruby scales and chitin, trimmed in tufts of golden fur at the elbows and knees, looking like drecrated long gloves and socks. From her shoulders came many more arms, as they fanned out, lining the area on the hood near her shoulders, looking like a Hindu goddess, with each clawed hand growing biger and more dangerous looking as they went out. Her legs had gargantuan thighs, blending in perfect squence hith her colossal ass, with an vast assortment  of similarly patterned legs, fanning in out in vast numbers before converging in a line of pairs down to the end of the hood. Her enlargerd torso was there to look natural with her 5 rows of breasts, decending by size, with even the lowest row being bigger than the multiverse. From the perfect oval of her stomach area came a massive bulge of a stomach a half the size of the humanoid figure, loozing like it could hold two multiverses at once, as a few of the vast number of arms tenderly rubbed it like an expecting mother. <br />
<br />
From below, her crotch was something to behold, a vast network or massive, gapping vaginas, grouped in a dimond shap in her nethers, each type the size of a galaxy. This wasn&#39;t the only place with these kind of orifices, each breast had its own dimond array of countless snatches, as did the area where her belly button should have been. Above her massive number of pussys was an endless sea of massive, thick tendril cocks, each with a multi-headed cock head, lined with retractable barbs and spikes. Some of these simply floated, several traveled over her body, fucking as many of her open orifices as they could find, from vigina to her many mouths. <br />
<br />
From her many pussys cane a constant stream of birth, but not simple beings, but of planets, soler systems and galaxies, each filled with the same monster life and environment she created on the goddesses world, making a new, monster filled multiver. Some worlds were Arabian themed, some with vast diverse biomes and cults, albeit savage looking, with furs, acient looking warmachines, thriving in a hunter-gather tribal society. That wasn&#39;t to say that there wasn&#39;t technology, some worlds held labs and academies dedicated to hyper advanced scientific and magical studies. But they were conducted  in and around vast tribal communities, with all varieties of perverse monster varieties. One lab was testing a new form of warp engine in an adjacent, torch filled room in a central ziggerot,  the lab decorated with just as many hunting furs and weapons as advanced machinery. It was filled with drop dead gorgeous futa monsters wareing revealing furs, working on the advanced calculations as they fucked one another. Along with them were galactic to plantary sized kaiju both to maintained order in her birthings, as well as fucking her as best they could. The endless birth of creation began to swirl around the naked goddess, forming the new multiverse into clothing, a divine robe covering her. It wasn&#39;t too big, intentionally looking slutty and hardly covering everything, but its size easily matched if not exceeded the current multiverse. As it ebbed and flowed around chaos, the cosmic robe actually drifted in one vagina and out another, this way the robe did not grow indefinitely, maintaining its shap inns series of constant birth and unbirth. Within chaos&#39;s womb, there was constant creation of new planets and galaxies, forming whole new universes, all held with the isolated pocket expanse of her womb. Finally, from her mouth, her many snatchs, from her dicks, and even from her every pour came her golden clouds, now a grand cosmic, nebula that rushed outward and filled all of the non existing void. Looking afar, her massive tail ebbed an weaved between the clouds as a central pillar of cloud around choas&#39;s upper humanoid body was surrounded by a pillar of cloud like a grand perch.  <br />
<br />
Chaos gave a mighty  moan of pleasure coming from her rebirth, feeling drunk on power and bliss. She couldn&#39;t help but reflect, in a way, she was still alec, her being might have changed but her soul remained intact, there was just so much more. Wishing to see the full breath of her, she conjured a screen of info on her new form. Her guild card was destroyed in her transformation, not that it could even comprehend what she was, and given her new nature, she wouldn&#39;t even need it to read it. But call it nostalgia, she wished to read it from a screen. Said screen was a tablet sized (to her) plate of chitinous black and red metal, black screen with white lettering and written in her monster language, <br />

<br />
Chaos read with glee, as she was now, she had no need for other skills, her being and will defined what can or will be. One thing only thing that left her slightly sad was her possession skill, the consumption of a primordial goddess like that was too much strain, and it was broken beyond repair. Perhaps she could fix it, but with her power, she could use similar powers without the skill, if not with greater results. Sensually, she rested her cosmicly vast ass on here fury hood, and beheld the original multiverse, now small enough that she could wrap around it with the smallest pair of her hands. Resting her left sided chins on her left sided hands, she pondered what to do first with this little bobble.<br />
<br />
She could deal with the deities first, they were no threat to l her now, all their power meaningless against her. But she supposed that the original goddess of chaos was due some revenge, it would be nice to warp her orderly sister into a sex fiend of monster god. That and she certainly would like to return to her home world, if nothing else than to have a ... chat with the God of her original reality.<br />
<br />
Then again, she could simply take her time and slowly shape this small, fragile reality into her image, watch as the gods of this reality see their creation and worlds be warped into monster havens with no power to stop it, then one by one be brought into the fold. Besides, she already spread her inflance on one world, she might as well finish what she started there.<br />
<br />
Or maybe she would simply focus on expanding her own multiverse, bask in her power and expanded her being even greater, let the gods stew in their urine soaked sandels a little while longer.<br />
<br />
Thinking as several of her hands went to to play with her numerous sexpots, chaos decided...</p>
