<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan got out of the shower after thoroughly enjoying his new body. He explored every inch of it with his new fingers, his firm muscular arms and legs, his lean core, his big sensitive cock, even his tight new ass. Ryan couldn’t ever remember feeling as confident or powerful in his whole life. Ryan had always been bookish and anxious as a child. He had been too afraid to play sports or workout. He thought he’d be teased for not knowing how to do it right, not to mention his fear of others seeing his little penis. So instead he immersed himself in academics. After a while Ryan almost prided himself on being a beta male. He was sensitive and caring and his wife liked that about him, or at least he thought she did. <br />
<br />
Ryan thought about all of this as he dried off and exited his bathroom. There on his bed, someone had laid out football gear. What was he suppose to do with this, Ryan thought to himself. “Umm Mom?” he called down figuring that was how Jake would do it, “Why is football stuff out?” Ryan heard Jake’s mother yelled back from down the hall, “because you have practice tonight and your father thinks you should still go.” Ryan weighed his options.  He didn’t know how to play football and even if Jake’s body was built for performance Ryan didn’t know how to use it.  “Mom, I don’t think I can go,” Ryan said, “not with everything that’s happened.”  Jake’s mother headed down the hallway to her son’s room and opened the door.  Ryan stood there in his towel, she gave him a stern look that softened as she saw something that was rare on her son’s face, it was more than worry it was devastation.  She acquiesced to his request and left the room.  Ryan found some gym shorts and a shirt and started to explore Jake’s life.  <br />
<br />
He started on Jake’s phone.  Luckily Jake had a nicer phone than he did, the fingerprint scanner got him right in.  If he had to go through all the different number code combinations it could have taken him weeks and that’s if the phone didn’t delete itself after a handful of failures.  Jake’s text messages, his emails, his photos, his internet browser history was all there.  Surprise, surprise on that last one Jake liked pornography. Ryan jumped back to the text messages.  Jake had a number of people he seemed to text regularly. Some of them Ryan recognized as other boys from the football team. There were a number of girls that Jake had been texting, in many of the chains explicit photos had been exchanged.  The girls were quite flattering of Jake’s manhood. <br />
<br />
 This research helped flush out the details of what Ryan already knew, Jake was a cocky little asshole. He considered himself an alpha male who got what he wanted because he took it, and no one could stand in his way.  Some of the text groups contained the details of vandalism and pranks that had gone unsolved at the school.  People who’d annoyed Jake or just existed in his world were the recipients of his justice.  What seemed worse is that Jake’s parents seemed to reward him for his actions.  Jake had a large room filled with nice furniture and new electronics; the kid had his own bathroom.  Ryan had attempted to deal with Jake through his parents before through emails, phone calls, and teacher conferences.  There son was perfect, it was Ryan who was wrong.  It didn’t help that the football coach, Mr. Johnson was always on his star running backs side.  There would be no punishment for Jake as long as he was doing well on the football field, Mr. Morris was just a sad pervert or hadn’t you heard.  The old clerks words rolled around in Ryan’s head, “switch forms at will.”  If Ryan could figure out how to do what happened again, he could trash Jake’s life, tear Ryan’s image and reputation apart exposing him for the little monster that he was.  <br />
<br />
Ryan would have to go back and talk to the old clerk again and find out more.  Ryan’s next moves depended on the old clerk and what lessons could be learned.</p>
