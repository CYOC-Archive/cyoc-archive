<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">whether or not Kyle had planned it the cheerleaders were now heading to the local zoo. of course by the time Jen got on the bus everyone had vaginas again. all 6 of the girls were excited about it because they get to out of school. although if they knew what was going to happen they probably would have stayed. their coach then told them this was a team exercise which annoyed Jen causing her C-cup breast with their coach&#39;s b cups.<br />
<br />
they arrived at the zoo and explored as a group. they arrived at the African section first and looked at a rhino while the zoo guide talked, Jen of course wasn&#39;t listening. instead, she saw the rhino laze about in its habitat, she was annoyed that it wasn&#39;t exciting and said &quot;wow that rhino is so cute sleeping, soon her entire torso slowly barreled out and the rhino&#39;s cock slowly became her own. &quot;come on Jen it&#39;s a majestic creature don&#39;t you think.&quot; Ashley said. &quot;yeah I guess&quot; Jen said lying sarcastically. Jen&#39;s body started to shirk as she gained Ashley&#39;s b-cup breasts and pussy. meanwhile, Ashley excused herself saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well, and went to the bathroom, her clothes starting to rip due to her new cock and torso.<br />
<br />
the next animal they saw was an elephant in the pool of its habitat. the elephant was clearly in a rut, its cock was constantly out. Jen, of course, was angry that they would let the creature out while its penis showed. &quot;guess your handlers are real perverts&quot; Jen said knowing it was a lie. her torso started to expand and a growth was starting to peek out of her skirt. &quot;hey Jen where is Ashley I can&#39;t find her.&quot; Katie said. &quot;I don&#39;t know maybe she&#39;s back on the bus,&quot; Jen said annoyed that Ashley had gone to the bathroom and abandoned them. Katie soon said she wasn&#39;t feeling well and told the coach that she was going to call her mom, as she left her height seemed to increase showing a grey cock hanging out of the top of her skirt.<br />
<br />
next was a group of lions resting on rocks. at this point, Jen was annoyed that the other cheerleaders were leaving Jen and she was forced to look at the dumb animals. &quot;your lionesses much be pretty stupid to love you hairball&quot; Jen said. her torso growing golden fur while her privates became a feline cock and balls. &quot;hey Jen show some respect, he&#39;s called the king of the jungle for a reason.&quot; Susan said. &quot;yeah what was I thinking you are such a lion expert,&quot; Jen said sarcastically, that lie swapped Jen&#39;s furry torso with Susan&#39;s c-cup breast and her lion cock with her pussy. she was wearing a turtle neck and long skirt so she didn&#39;t realize that she now had a lion torso and crotch. <br />
<br />
they soon left the African area and went to the artic exhibit. where a polar bear was swimming in the water. Jen wasn&#39;t impressed and said &quot;wow that&#39;s impressive&quot; as she rolled her eyes. her torso was expanding while her pussy was swapped with the 9-inch penis of the bear. &quot;hey Jen look how amazing that bear is.&quot; Mary said. &quot;yeah Mary he&#39;s great.&quot; Jen replied sarcastically. her chest shifting in both size and color as it became African American with double d-cup breasts, her pussy now matched. Mary, on the other hand, felt ill and just like Katie she went to the front and called her mom. <br />
<br />
at this point, Jen was getting upset that her fellow cheerleaders were leaving, and even Susan was acting off for some reason. by the time they had gotten to the jungle portion, she was furious. she went to the ape enclosure and vented to the first ape she saw. &quot; oh your so happy being a stupid beast while I&#39;m happy as well, can&#39;t you see&quot; Jen said as her breast started shrinking and she grew the ape&#39;s 12 inch hairy balls and impressive 8-inch cock. &quot;Jen show some respect, now what&#39;s the problem?&quot; her coach asked. &quot;what the problem, oh I don&#39;t know maybe all the other girls are leaving but I&#39;m not bitter,&quot; Jen said as she now had perky c-cup breasts again and a vagina. &quot;well since your so unhappy how about we see one last animal then we&#39;ll leave.&quot; her coach said as hair poked out of the collar of her shirt.<br />
<br />
the last stop was the tiger exhibit, however, at this point, Jen couldn&#39;t care less about the trip. &quot;oh wow you&#39;re a tiger so impressive.&quot; Jen said as striped fur appeared on her torso and a feline cock and balls pushed against her skirt. &quot;hey Jen does the coach and Susan look off to you. I mean you would know all about things being off.&quot; Julie asked while mocking Jen. &quot;I don&#39;t know maybe they think you have the plague or something,&quot; Jen said her chest now bare of fur and she now had Kyle&#39;s small cock once again. Julie on the other hand now had tiger fur poking out of her low v-neck and an 11-inch cock  hanging under her skirt.<br />
<br />
by the time they got back to the bus, Jen refused to talk to anyone, in her anger, she didn&#39;t notice the changes to the cheer group. Ashley left because she soon found herself with an 8-foot-long torso of a rhino as well as the rhino dick poking out of her pants. Katie left next as she now had the 18-foot torso of an elephant which for some reason she could move despite its massive size and cock to match. Susan sat in the back fidgeting while trying to keep her clothes from ripping and show the 6-foot tall torso and her new cock for everyone to see. Mary left once she noticed her shirt ripped off revealing a 9-foot-tall furry white torso and 9-inch bear cock on her body. the coach was almost completely oblivious that she now had the hairy 5-foot torso and ape cock as her height barely changed. Julie like Susan was trying (and failing) to hide her 7-foot tiger torso from showing as well as her feline cock.</p>
