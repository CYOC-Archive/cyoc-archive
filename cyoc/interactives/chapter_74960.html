<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake glanced over at a row of different styles of flip-flops stacked against each other in a complete mess. He did need a new pair after all, his <br />
old ones had been falling apart, he did ponder for a moment as to why they were in a sex shop's 'Fetish Section' though, but it didn't bother <br />
him why. Jake quickly became quite enthralled by all the different kinds he had to pick from, shopping had never been this entertaining before! <br />
He picked a few different pairs out holding them in his arms as he continued to browse with his hands. He remembered that he was only <br />
allowed one item for free, so begrudgingly he put all the pairs back into the messy mountain of rubber in front of him. Quickly he tried to <br />
decide which style he preferred the most. He glanced around and spotted the ends of a pair that seemed to be a unique, one-of-a-kind style <br />
amongst the other pairs. He could only make out part of the rubber soles in the pile but he could tell that the particular style was special, the <br />
black and white patterned stripes stood out brightly amongst the other pairs, so without any further deliberation he snatched the pair out of <br />
the mound and hurried to the Change Room.<br />
<br />
He kicked off his shoes and socks and removed the connecting hanger from the flip-flops and placed them on the floor; that's when he noticed <br />
the size 19 sticker on the top of the patterned rubber. &quot;Aw crap...&quot; He thought perhaps he could go back and search again, but he was quite <br />
certain these were the only ones in that style left. &quot;No point going back, might as well try these on to see how they look and see if the assistant <br />
can get me a pair in my size&quot; he thought to himself, shrugging his shoulders subconsciously.<br />
<br />
He slipped the flip-flops onto his feet, the enormous slabs still had over an inches gap at the front and another inch at the back, his standard <br />
size 9.5's clearly unable to fill the gargantuan flip-flops. He looked into the long mirror pinned to the wall next to him. &quot;They look good! Just <br />
need em in my size...&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
As he stood and thought about where he might find the shop assistant he felt a slight tingle run up from his toes, it interrupted his thought, he <br />
thought it was probably just a floor vent somewhere making a draught. But the tingling continued and intensified within only a few seconds. <br />
&quot;What the...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake tilted his head down to look at his strange-feeling feet. He watched for a few seconds, squinting with a frown, he couldn't be seeing what <br />
he was seeing, did his toes just... grow? &quot;Huh?! Probably just the stripe pattern playing tricks with my eyes...&quot; he thought, slightly worried. He <br />
continued to watch, and surely, slowly his toes pushed every so slightly further up the rubber sole, beginning to cover the next stripe up from <br />
where his toes lay originally. Well at least he thought that's what he saw, but that was impossible, surely? <br />
<br />
Jake mumbled to himself, surely this wasn't happening. He bent over to look closer, but it appeared that whatever was happening had stopped, <br />
his feet didn't really appear to be any different, but he could almost be certain that his toes now reached the next stripe ahead on the sole.<br />
<br />
He straightened back up and prepared to take the huge flip-flops off when his feet suddenly became awash with a powerful heat. &quot;Ah, fuck, <br />
what is that?!&quot; He looked down at his feet again, his feet were... growing! Slowly, but fast enough that he could see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! What the fuck! Damn they're getting hot!&quot; he yelled out. He quickly kicked off the enormous rubber mats, but his feet continued to be <br />
subjected to a strange internal heat. He fell back onto the seat behind him grabbing his left foot into his lap. He could see and feel his feet <br />
slowly expanding, his soles growing longer and wider, his toes lengthening and thickening.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is happening! Stop!&quot; he yelled out, trying to resist the changes slowly occurring. Suddenly his feet were awash with tingling and a <br />
stronger heat. &quot;Ahh, please, what's happening!&quot; he spoke out loudly, wondering why no-one could hear him. The changes began to accelerate, <br />
rapidly. <br />
<br />
He watched helplessly as his soles expanded across the floor. He felt the tops of his feet stretching as tendons and muscles grew strong and <br />
thick. His sole continued to push out longer, his heel lengthening, the ball of his foot doing the same. Bit by bit his foot lengthened, only <br />
widening slightly. &quot;No, someone stop it please!&quot; he yelled out, his feet now already looking long, lean and strong now. His feet had grown over <br />
an inch longer, his toes now looking disproportionately small. But then they began their own expansion. He could feel his toes beginning to <br />
push through the carpet on the floor. But not only were they growing, they were reshaping. His watched his toes begin to change their very <br />
shape, pushing out longer, the ends becoming wider, his nails reshaping accordingly, looking well trimmed and looked after. His big toes <br />
pushed out widening and lengthening to sizes Jake had never seen on anyone, surely almost 3 inches long he thought to himself. His other <br />
toes were swelling accordingly, becoming long, thick and strong. Jake could feel them twitch slightly as they grew longer and longer. He'd <br />
never seen toes so long, let alone felt what it was like to have them. The hair on his feet darkened and grew out slightly, the patches on his <br />
toes and the tops of his feet becoming thicker.<br />
<br />
The heat subsided, his feet were now big enough to fit the size 19 flip-flops. Perfectly. No longer did he have typical size 9.5's, these feet were <br />
narrow, long and powerful, his toes looking unusually long and strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, size 19's on someone only 6 feet tall?! I'm a freak! Change back damn it!&quot; Jake slumped into the seat with his hands over his face, <br />
his long, powerful, veiny feet sitting on the floor in front of him. At that moment he felt a slight tingle enter his head. &quot;Oh shit, please, no, no <br />
more!&quot; he moaned sounding depressed. He stopped sulking for a moment as he felt his mind become foggy, something changing, he rubbed <br />
his temple as the white noise in his mind continued, he felt new thoughts entering his mind, his personality being changed, a new awareness of <br />
what had happened to him. &quot;I... Uh.... Ahh... I guess... this isn't so bad...&quot; he mumbled as regained control of his now modified mind, &quot;Yeah... <br />
actually... it's pretty cool!&quot; he chuckled to himself, wiggling his enormous toes. &quot;Yeah in fact it's pretty sexy! Hmm, yeah, I... I've never felt like <br />
this before, but fuck, I love big feet! Yeah, big, strong, manly feet!&quot; Part of his mind told him that his new feet and flip-flops both had the <br />
power to give other people huge feet like his own, whether willing or unwilling. &quot;Haha, mmm, who wouldn't want to worship these bad boys <br />
and get a set of their own!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a new love for feet, and a new confidence and power of his own, Jake slipped on his new flip-flops and left the store, deciding to...</p>
