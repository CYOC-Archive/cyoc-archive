<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria looked to who to choose on the beach and came up with a good decision.  Looking right to the older woman with the son, she figured that she was looking for a hot guy to be the husband.  But looking at the son’s face, he doesn’t feel like having a dad he doesn’t know.  It’s almost like he is overprotected of his mom.  Just the thought of it gave her an idea and pointed to the two.  “Hey!  What about those two over there.”<br />
<br />
Jackie and Sasha turned to see the mother and son and figured that its what she choose.  “Those two?” Jackie asked, “The mother and son?  Doesn’t look like much to work with?”<br />
<br />
“I agree.” Sasha responded, “I don’t see what you want to do with those two?  To me, it looks like just a normal mother looking for a husband and the son just not interested.”<br />
<br />
“That’s the point!” Gloria said, “The son looks over protected with the mother and didn’t like the idea of a father he doesn’t know about.  But if I turn him into the husband, he would love the mother and protect him more.”<br />
<br />
They both thought of the plan and could tell that it was a good enough plan.  “Well…  What are you waiting for?” Jackie said, “Get started with it.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  I want to see what happens to him.” Sasha responded.<br />
<br />
Gloria heard that and decided to do something different.  “Oh, I will.  But let me do it my way.” she said as she hold on to the ring and made her with in thought.<br />
<br />
‘I wish that the son over there will slowly grow into a muscle bound man.  He will age physically and mentally to help match the mother’s and that he will be the husband for her.  As an added bonus, he will be aware of the changes as he slowly grow and watch himself aging.’<br />
<br />
The ring on her finger started to glow, accepting the wish and using its magic on the son.  When it was done, Gloria told the others to look on.  “Now all we need to do is to sit back and watch.” She said as the three looked on to see what happens.<br />
<br />
Not far from them, June was getting a little frustrated.  She had wanted to spend a nice day at the beach, let Tommy have some fun while she scoped out any potential men who she could bring back home.  But as soon as any man started talking with her, Tommy kicked up such a fuss.  “Tommy, if you don&#39;t keep your voice down, we&#39;re going back home,&quot; said June sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like those men,&quot; pouted Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy, Mommy just wants to make friends.  Don&#39;t you want to have a daddy some day?&quot; asked June.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I want a daddy?  You&#39;re all I ever want,&quot; said Tommy.<br />
<br />
June sighed in exasperation.  Tommy was just a little too attached to her.  It wasn&#39;t his fault.  He never knew his father.  She hadn&#39;t even seen that jerk after that one-night stand.  But while she was trying her best to raise Tommy on her own, she still felt a woman&#39;s needs.  And it would be better for Tommy if he had a father to look after him.  If only he&#39;d let other men come near her.<br />
<br />
But for Tommy, it was a whole different story.  He always looked up to his mom since growing up in a world without a father.  So much so that he doesn’t feel like having an adopted dad.  Every time his mother looks at a random guy that she finds appeasing, Tommy gets overprotected and forces a wedge between them.  Not that he can blame himself.  Even at the age of eight, Tommy knew how beautiful his mother is.<br />
<br />
Even at thirty, June was quite a looker and kept her body in shape to become a magnet to the men.  She’s sporting a pair of large D cup breasts that hang tightly around her dark blue latex bikini that shows some cleavage.  Her stomach was tight and curvy and shows off slight dusting of abs.  Her rear of big and round to help accommodate her curvy hourglass body with a bit of cellulite to form a much more mature fit, getting snuggly over the dark blue swimsuit panties that are beyond the imagination.  Her arms and legs were long and shows some feminine muscle tone after years of yoga and aerobics.  And her face is completely awestrucking with high cheekbones, a petite thin nose, lustful brown eyes, plushy lips, and long flowing sandy brown hair that goes down the middle of her back.  With the exception of small faint lines around her mouth and eyes, she has the body of a supermodel.<br />
<br />
And that’s something Tommy is worried about.  As her look and body can make every guy in the beach turn to her.  If he can try to stop them and have her all to himself, maybe that would do the trick.  But what can he do with a bunch of buffed men.  He wasn’t anywhere near their physic.<br />
<br />
Looking at himself, he could tell that he has a long ways to go.  At the age of eight, he was just a small child with a lot of growing up to do.  He was short and pudgy with a gut around the straps of his bright red swimsuit.  His arms and legs were small and showed signs of a late baby weight.  And his face was really chubby with the cheeks sticking out along with a mop of shaggy brown hair.  So he’s definitely doesn’t have the body necessary to compete and protect his own mother.  If only he would grow up and protect her from these strange men and be the only one who will look after her.<br />
<br />
As he was thinking about it, he felt a warm from that spread up his body from his head to his toes.  The feeling soon disappeared, as he rubbed his arms, wondering what happened.  “Whoa!  What was that?  I almost felt warm for a second.” he said, confused by what happened.  What he didn’t know is that Gloria made her wish on the age ring.  Because of that, the changes were beginning without Tommy noticing it.<br />
<br />
Tommy soon started to play in the sand, not noticing what was going to happen.  But as he was playing, something didn’t feel right.  In his view, it felt like the sand is pulling further away from him.  “What the…?” he asked in confusion.  He soon starred at his hand and saw something very peculiar.  Looking on, each of his fingers were steadily lengthening and the little baby gat he has started to melt away.  “No way!”  Getting up, he noticed that he was taller, and thinner.  Tommy starred in disbelief as he realized he aged two years, centering the double digits.<br />
<br />
Looking to himself, he was shocked over the fact that he had grown significantly and slowly aging at an alarming rate.  “Wow!  This is incredible!  How did I grow up that fast?” he asked himself, not realizing that his voice was cracking and getting deeper.  Course, Gloria and her friends are the cause of it, but he doesn’t know it yet.  He soon turned to his mother and showed what’s happening to him.<br />
<br />
“Mom!  Mom!  Look at me!  Do you see this?”<br />
<br />
June heard her son and turned to him to see something different and didn’t know what was going on.  “What are you talking about, Tommy?”<br />
<br />
Tommy could tell that she’s not believing him and showed him.  “What I’m talking about?  Look!  I have grown up!  I could be eleven now!”<br />
<br />
June looked at him and thought that he was crazy.  “Of course you are Tommy, dear.  You are eleven.  You’re a grown boy and grown boys are always that rambunctious at that age.  Can only imagine what you would grow up to.  And to think that I gave birth to you eleven years ago.”<br />
<br />
Tommy heard that and realized that something wasn’t right.  She said that she gave birth to him eleven years ago when in reality it was eight.  So technically, he was born in the year 2008, not 2011.  Is it possible that as he was aging, the reality was altering to match his age?<br />
<br />
“Mom…  What are you-?  Ow!” he said ultimately feeling a tingly feeling in his body.<br />
<br />
June looked to him and asked what happened.<br />
<br />
“Tommy?  Are you okay?” she asked with worry.<br />
<br />
Tommy felt it pass as he answered, “I don’t know…  I felt something painful.”  What he didn’t know is that his body was going through his first growth spurt.  His height increased by five inches and was up to five feet.  Not only that, his muscles were tensing up a little bit and was gaining some early teen build.  Not only that, but his face was loosing it’s cuteness and childish look.  The cheekbones were flattening and his eyes look smaller.  His hair was even shaggier and it grew and curls.<br />
<br />
June look to her now twelve year old son and was a little in a daze until she responded kindly.  “Of course you are feeling pain.  You’re growing.  It’s normal for a twelve year old.”<br />
<br />
Now Tommy was feeling scared.  His own mother was behaving normally, not realizing that he’s aging.<br />
<br />
“But mom!”<br />
<br />
“No buts, Thomas!  Now behave yourself, or we’ll leave the beach no questions asked.”<br />
<br />
Thomas was shocked as he heard his full first name, and not his nickname.  What exactly is happening with him and around him?  He soon doubled over in pain and felt queasy in the stomach.<br />
<br />
“Argh…  I don’t feel so good…  I need to use the bathroom!”<br />
<br />
He soon ran away from his mom and made a mad dash to the restroom.  June look to her son running and sighed to herself.  “Oh, that kid.  He’s becoming a man now.  Already thirteen and he’s growing up too much.  Wish he was born earlier, so he wouldn’t be too much of a problem.”<br />
<br />
Gloria, Jackie, and Sasha saw Tommy running towards the restroom and were already surprised by his slow growth.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!  Look at that!  That kid was growing up!” Jackie said with complete surprise.<br />
<br />
“Tell me about.  He almost looks like he’s in his preteen.  That’s dope!” she said as she turned to Gloria asking about something.  “So…  How hold is he going to be?  I mean, you wished to make him older right.  So at what age you are planning?”<br />
<br />
Gloria heard the two and knew that they wanted some answers.  With a smirk, she answered with, “Oh…  You’ll see when he comes back out.  You two are in for a surprise.”<br />
<br />
In the rest room, Tommy was in the stall and started to throw up.  He was completely bewildered about what’s been going on as of late.  One minute, he was getting jealous of her mother picking up guys.  The next minute, he started to grow older and mom is behaving like he is older.  And older he is becoming.  He’s already fourteen and slowly growing and expanding.  He already past the five foot mark and was going through another growth spurt.  His muscle slowly expanding and was showing and lean teen build.  After throwing up chunks, he got out up and was trying to debate what is happening.<br />
<br />
“What is going on?  Seriously?  I’m growing up and mom is acting like I’m older.  It doesn’t make any sense.  How am I changing like this and mom behaving like I am that old?  It DOEsn’t mAKe anY SENce!”<br />
<br />
He soon stops talking as he heard his voice cracking.  Rubbing his throat, he could feel a small bump growing.  It was no doubt that his Adams apple was beginning to form as he was going through his awkward teenage phase.  Rubbing it, he decided to try his voice again, wondering if he’s hearing this right.<br />
<br />
“HELlo.  My nAMe IS TomMY And I’m EIGht yEArs OLd.  I LIve wITh mY MOMmy AND wE live very happy together.”<br />
<br />
He could finally hear his voice normalizing, but it sounded deeper and more mature, yet attain a form of childish tone.<br />
<br />
“Finally, it’s over.  Though my voice sounds far different then before.”<br />
<br />
Slowly getting up, he left the stall to see if any damage was done.  He soon notices that his height was higher then normal and looked to be in the middle of five feet.<br />
<br />
“Freaky…  I look taller and everything looks small.  I wonder what else has changed?”<br />
<br />
He soon approached the full-length mirror that is a part of the locker room.  What he saw was completely shocking.  Standing before him was not an eight year old kid, but instead a young teenage boy of fifteen.  Despite his height, he could tell that he was gaining girth as well.  His shoulders have broadened and his chest started to puff out.  His stomach was thin with no sign of his flabbiness anywhere. His arms and legs, while long, have gained some muscles with his biceps bulging and gluts increasing.  Even his swimming trunks have changed as well, as the color darkened and started to get tighter.  Looking to himself, he marveled at the sight of himself.<br />
<br />
“Wow!  Look at me.  I look more like a teenage then a kid.  I bet I can even pass as a high schooler.” He said with amazement.<br />
<br />
As he said that, he felt something coming out of his mouth and landed on the floor.  Looking down, he wondered what it was.  Bending with his growing height, he saw multiple white pieces on the floor.  It was then that he realized that it was his baby teeth that was coming out.<br />
<br />
“Are all those my baby teeth?  Gross!” he saw in a lower teen tone.<br />
<br />
Getting up he looked to himself in the mirror and saw his face aging as well.  Most of his childish look was almost gone as his face was oval and his cheeks were flat.  His nose started to grow big and long and his lips was gaining carteledge to give him a manly kiss.  His eyes looked smaller, yet at the same time, completely mature as tiny hairs started to poke through his chin, forming an awkward need like faze.  The same can be said with his skin as pimples started to appear on his face.  Even his hair was shaggier then before as it looked like he wasn’t groomed in his teens.<br />
<br />
Starring at his new look, he was conflicted on what he’s witnessing.  “What am I going to do?  I can’t just go back to aunt like this.  She’ll freak out!”  Just then, the thought that   “Wait…  Did I just say aunt?  She’s not my aunt, she’s my mom, right?”<br />
<br />
What was happening is that Tommy memories were altering and aging to match his growing body.  Now he’s thinking June is more of an aunt then a mother.  He rubbed the back of his head and was really starting to get confused.<br />
<br />
“This is so surreal…” he said with his vocabulary increasing.  “Why is this happening to me?  How is it possible that I’m growing and thinking differently.”  Rubbing his chin, he decided to test something.  “I have to see if what is happening is to me.”  With a sigh, he decided to return to his now aunt and see what is going on.  “Looks like I have no choice but to speak to my aunt.  Or is it my mom?  Damn it!  Can’t think straight anymore.”<br />
<br />
So he walks out of the locker room and returned to June, not realizing that he’s continuing to grow.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Tommy continued to walk back to his now Aunt.  He rubbed his hands and don’t know how June would react to his body.  <br />
<br />
“Okay, Tommy…  You can do this.  This is your aunt now; she is still your mother too.  If I talk to her, she’ll respond at best.  If  she freaks out, I’ll do my best in explaining to her.  I just hope she doesn’t call the cops on me.”<br />
<br />
As he was walking, his body was slowly starting to age up through his teens.  His body continued to stretch and was closing in at six feet.  At the same time, his teenage muscles continued to expand and was gaining a light body build look.  His chest puffed and harden into some hot looking pecks.  His stomach was flat and was toning up with a dusting of abs starting to show.  His gluts, knees, and biceps pumped hard and was gaining strength after each step.  There was also tiny hairs starting to grow on his chest, arms, and legs, making him more mature then before.  Even his face was leaving his awkward teen phase and reaching young adulthood.  His jaw started to look squared and his nose was big and stout.  His eyes were more mature looking and his hair was starting to shorten and restyled into a young adult look.  At the same time, the tiny hairs on his chin started to multiply and grow, forming a short and simple goatee and more hair came out of his upper lip to form a mustache.  In hindsight, Tommy started to look more mature at his age of eighteen.<br />
<br />
As he slowly started to see his mother, or aunt, resting easily on the beach chair, checking on the men and all.  Tommy sighed as he slowly approached her, wondering if she could remember him.<br />
<br />
As he was walking towards her, Gloria, Jackie, and Sasha watched from afar and saw Tommy returning from his bathroom break.  And the reactions they have with him were priceless.<br />
<br />
“Whoa!  Is that the kid from before?” Jackie asked in shock.<br />
<br />
Sasha saw this as well and couldn’t help but to smirk and had lustful thoughts in her head.  “Mmm…  Sure looks like it.  Just took at the bod.  It looks so hot.  I feel like I come over to him and give him a kiss.  Who needs that woman when she can have me instead.”<br />
<br />
Gloria turned to her and told her, “Now Sasha, we don’t want to interfere.  I made the wish so that the kid can get the mom.  We just need to watch and see how it will play out.  Watch…”<br />
<br />
Sasha turned to her and was a little jealous over that.  But she just shrugged it off and turned to see how the changes will play out.<br />
<br />
As they watched on, Tommy look down to the woman who was use to be his mom and cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me…  M…  Aunt June.”<br />
<br />
June heard that voice and turned to see Tommy standing there, now a young adult man.  Looking at him, she smirked and said, “My Thomas, you certainly quite a look.  Back from the bathroom?”<br />
<br />
Tommy, or Thomas, blinked and was surprised that she was unscathed his growing body.  Not only that, but she’s referring to him by his real grown up name, since Tommy is more childish.  Blinking, he cleared his throat and said, “Um…  Yeah…  Had a bit of a bathroom break.  Drank too much soda and all.”<br />
<br />
June sighed and figured that he was doing his own business.  “Oh Thomas, I know you’re my nephew and all, but you can’t simply hide the truth.  Let me guess, you’ve been fapping in the toilet stalls, were you?”<br />
<br />
Thomas heard that and flushed red, hearing that word.  “What?  Aunt June!  I wasn’t doing that!”<br />
<br />
June smirked a little and gave a bit of a chuckle.  “It’s all right, Thomas.  It’s not embarrassing to do your own business.  It’s natural for a growing boy of your own.  Though I think that you should do it back home and not in a public area.  Don’t want you to get into too much trouble now, can I?”<br />
<br />
Thomas was still red hot and was trying to process what he heard.  Was his former mother was telling him about the birds and the bees, in a much more deeper sense?  That is super strange for him.  Trying to calm down, he shrugged it off and said, “Sure…  Whatever you say, Aunt June.”<br />
<br />
“Perfect.  Now come sit by me.  Enjoy the warm summer day.  Who knows, you might find some hot chicks around here.  I know I’m looking for my own personal favorite.” She said as she was scooping a body builder that was lifting some weights.<br />
<br />
Thomas saw that and has a bit of jealousy toward the men who is around June.  But this jealousy was much different then back when he saw just a kid.  This was completely different.  Thinking that it was nothing, he approached the beach chair next to her and lay there.  Soon enough, the two were resting on the beach, soaking on the rays and relaxing, with June looking at a few guys along the way.<br />
<br />
Minutes have passed as the two were laying on the chairs and nothing more.  But for Tommy, he was conflicted with what was going on. Minutes ago, he was just a young kid who was being over protected on his mom when she looks at the men around them.  Now he grew into a young adult and his mother is now his niece.  Didn’t seem the make sense in his own altering mind.  Yet, it was becoming normal for him.  He just hope that he was just dreaming and nothing more.  But to him, it was feeling rather real.  Turning to his side, he could see his aunt and noticed how hot she looked.  From those huge breasts, to her curvy waist, the shapely legs, and beautiful face, she was becoming quite the looker.  Just the way he thought of her made him turned on more.  It was then that he felt a stir in his swimming shorts and something started to poke out.  What was going on is that his boner was sexually active as he was thinking about how hot his former mother was.  During that thought, his body begins to grow a little more.<br />
<br />
His body started to slide on the chair as he grew over six feet, stopping at that height.  But that didn’t mean that the rest of the growth was going to happen.  His muscles were beginning to bulk up and creating a body build look to him.  His shoulder expanded further and led to his chest to flatten and tightened into manly pecks.  His stomach was getting toner and his abs were more defined then before.  His arms and legs have increased in mass and there were veins spewing out of the skin.  The hairs on his chest, arms, and legs were growing longer and more defined.  Even his erected penis was extending longer and poking out of his swimming shorts, with darkened into a black like color and it’s texture was turning more latex.  Plus his face kept on maturing and there was no sign of his child like look.  His jaw line was squared and rugged, his lips mature and wide, nose was big and thin, and his eyes were small and mature.  The hair on his head was arranging into a more adult like look as it was parting front one end to another.  As the same time, his mustache and goatee grew and went around his lips, forming a short beard.  Pretty soon, Thomas was a full-grown man of twenty one and is still changing the more he thinks of his former mother.<br />
<br />
The girls watched it all go down and was in awe by the site of the growing man.<br />
<br />
“Wow…  Is it me, or is he getting even hotter.” Sasha said with a bit of lust in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jackie chuckled and could agree with her friend.  “Sure looks that way.  And look at that boner.  He’s got quite the length.  Wonder how deep I can go with that.” She licked her lips, thinking about banging on him.<br />
<br />
Gloria heard the two and told them that he’s already taken.  “Now girls, let’s not get a little ahead of ourselves.  That man will soon be taken by his mom.  Well…former mom.  Don’t even think about making out with him.”<br />
<br />
The two heard her as Sasha started to sigh.  Sure, they want to make love with this stud, but they know that Thomas is supposed to be with his former mother.  So all they can do is sit back and enjoy the show.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the show, Thomas was laying next to his now Aunt and was still thinking of what’s been going on as of late.  He was just a little kid who is over protected of his mom checking out all the guys on the beach as a potential future husband.  Now he’s just college boy who’s starting to take a keen interest of his former mother.  And who could blame him.  Looking to June, she was quite the hot one.  Those big breasts, those curvy hips, that mature and beautiful face.  She was every guys dream.  And to Thomas, he is started to feel the effects at how sexy she looked compared to the insecure child that he was.<br />
<br />
Not only the effects, but also the bossy was starting to age up as well.  As the years kept on piling up, his body didn’t shot up anymore as he was at the exceeding height.  However, his muscles slowly started to bulk up and veins were appearing on his arms and legs.  His chest became to wide as two washboards as his 6-pack has upgraded into an 8-pack.  His face kept on maturing, turning him into quite a stud with his cheeks pronounced, lips manly, nose big and bulbous, and eyes small and mature like.  While his hair hasn’t changed, his beard started to extend along his face until it connects to his sideburns.  But the only thing that is starting to get some attention is Thomas penis.  It started to grow and tent more underneath his swimming trunks with his balls expanding even more.  Even his trunks were changing and was growing smaller.  It darkened to a black like color while white stripes started to appear.  The texture soon changed into latex and tightened around his wait, turning into short like Speedos.  Thomas could feel the tightness in his front area, especially his junk as he could see his erected dick in full view.  He wanted to cover himself, hoping that no one will see it, and try to calm himself down.  But it’s not going to be easy calming down when you voluptuous crush is next to you.  He then blinked and realized what he thought about.  June?  A crush?  He thought she was his mother, or an aunt, not a crush.  Is it possible that his mind is altering to think these strange new sensations?  As he thought about it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Tommy…”<br />
<br />
He heard his name coming from his now crush and turned to see her looking at him.  Gulping, he said to her, “Yes…June Bug?”  He soon heard himself calling her by a nickname.  Something is definitely wrong.<br />
<br />
June soon got her arm into her bag and told him, “Tommy…  I think I feel a little burnt.  Think you can apply some bathing lotion on me?”<br />
<br />
She soon got the sun tan lotion out and shook it in front of his face.  Thomas was flustering red and was a little surprised that she wants him to apply lotion on her.  Normally when they are on the beach, she would ask a random hunk to do that.  But this time, it looks like that now he’s older, he would be the one to do it.  A part of him wanted to say no and get out of the awkwardness.  But his body was thinking differently as he smiled and said, “Sure thing, June.  I’ll do it for you.”<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, he got up from the beach chair and took the lotion from her.  Squirting a good enough batch, he rubbed his hands and asked, “So…  Where do you want me to start?”<br />
<br />
June smiled seductively and said to him, “Well…  Why not start with the back, it is getting a little pale as of late.”  She soon rolled over and showed him her back.  “Here.  Allow me to remove the bra.  Don’t want to have tan lines there.”  She soon proceeded to unhook the bra and it falls off her upper back.  “There…  Now you can proceed.”<br />
<br />
Thomas saw this and was even more aroused.  So much so that his erection was tenting more, showing the bump on his latex Speedo.  His mind was screaming see her behave like that.  But his adult persona was slowly taking over and licked his lips a little.  “Whatever you say, June Bug.”<br />
<br />
Rubbing his hands together, he went to the beach chair and got on top of his crush.  He soon started to rub her back up and down, making sure he doesn’t miss a single spot.  At the same type, his covered crotch rubbed her lower back up and down with each motion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, with the three girls, Sasha and Jackie starred gawkily at the sight and were completely amazed at the show.<br />
<br />
“OMG!  Look at that!” Sasha said to the two girls.  That hunk is giving that woman a sun tan massage, that that use to be the son.  I’m so jealous of her.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah!  Why don’t we have sun tan massages like her.  I want to get a piece of the action.” Jackie said in annoyance.<br />
<br />
Gloria could tell that they were getting a little anxious and assured them that they will get some.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, girls.  Let’s not ruin the moment.” She said to them, “We need to let the ring’s magic run its course.  And by the looks of it, it’s almost finished.  Besides, when it’s over, we’ll find some hot guys to get massages.”<br />
<br />
The two heard her and knew that she does have a point.  That boy wants to be with his mom in a whole different way.  And judging by the changes so far, it would seem like it is slowing down.  So they decided to watch the conclusion of the show and responded to Gloria’s proposal.<br />
<br />
“Kay, Gloria.  You wan.” Sasha first said, “We’ll finish watching, and then we’ll find some cute guys to get tan messages.”<br />
<br />
But Jackie turned to her and said in a harsh tone, “But you better be sure that they would be smoking hot like him.  I don’t like to see a blubber bod.”<br />
<br />
Gloria heard that and chuckled, know that’s what Jackie wanted.  “I won’t make any promises.  But I’ll try.”<br />
<br />
So the three went back to watching the show, ready to see the end results.<br />
<br />
Back to Thomas, he was living his dream as he was putting sun tan lotion on June’s back, massaging it with both his hands and, oddly enough, his crotch.  It was strange to him, since June used to be his mother, but now as he kept on growing, he became more of a lover then a son.  The younger side was screaming, pleading to stop, but the adult side was taking full control and was enjoying himself, completely.  It was like a blissful experience for him.<br />
<br />
But as he was enjoying himself, his body continued to age one last time.  But as he age, the changes are beginning differently.  His stomach started to round out into a bit of a beer gut, but still has the abs present.  His muscles all across his body proceeded to soften up, but still remain physically tone and fit.  His face started to get a bit more rugged with faint lines on his around his mouth and eyes while gray streaks appeared on his bread and a ring of gray around his head.  There was also thinning in the front of his head as his hair line receded back to form an arrow in the center and a small bald spot appeared in the back of his head.  Pretty soon, Thomas became a thirty year old man, the same age as his former mother.  And while he slightly aged, he still look stacked.<br />
<br />
Once he finished with messaging and tanning her, Thomas bend down to her and whispered to her ear, “You are enjoying yourself, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
June chuckled a little and said back, “What gave that away?”<br />
<br />
Thomas soon stood up by the knees on the chair while June turned back, using her hands to keep her bra on her huge breasts and was smiling to him.<br />
<br />
“You know…” she started to say, “I always wanted a hot guy with a hotter bod to come and keep me company.  But you?  You are something I’ve ever dreamed of.  I’m so glad that I married you, Tommy Boy.”<br />
<br />
Thomas heard that and new memories started to emerge, turns out, June was not longer a mother he was overprotected of.  Instead, he was becoming the husband June wanted.  His childish mind was starting to fade away as the adult side was fully awaken.  He now can be with her in a different light, and loving light.  To be with her forever and never letting go.  That is something he wanted since he was a boy minutes before.  With a smile, he starred at her with loving eyes and said to her, “And I am happy to be your sweet husband.”<br />
<br />
With that, the two started to get close to each other with Thomas bending back down.  The moment their faces got close to each other, they soon patted each other on the lips and begin kissing.  It was slow at first, but that soon changed as they mooch their faces to each other.  Thomas has his chest pressing on June’s breast as she has her hands rubbing his back.  During their make out, the final changes happen as a wedding ring appeared on Thomas’s finger and shines brightly.  Now the two went from being a mother and son, to a husband and wife.<br />
<br />
Gloria, Sasha, and Jackie saw it all go down and were impressed.<br />
<br />
“Ah…  Look at that.  It would seem that they two are meant to be together forever.”  Gloria said with passion.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…  I guess that the kid really wanted to be with her and now he got his wish.” Sasha went on.<br />
<br />
Jackie crossed her arms and pouted a little bit.  “Yeah…  Well…  Too bad that we don’t have someone like him with us.  We should have hot guys like him.”<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed and knew Jackie was a little annoyed.  “In time, Jackie, in time.  For now, let’s enjoy our little beach vacation.”<br />
<br />
The three soon went back to their vacation and wondered what to do next.</p>
