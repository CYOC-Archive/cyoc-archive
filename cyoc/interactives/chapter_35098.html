<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I don't know why I'm writing this down, I really don't know who I would ever tell about all <br />
of this, and it's not like I'd ever forget.<br />
<br />
Still, I feel the need to write it down anyways.  My name is Joanna Franklin, but everyone <br />
calls me Jo.  Right around the time I had my first period, I started shooting up like a weed, <br />
and by the time I was 14 I was 6' tall.  At 19 I'm 6' 2&quot;, and I hate it.  I'm taller than my <br />
boyfriend, Mark, and even though he says he doesn't mind, I really wish I was shorter.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that my best friend, Naomi, is exactly the kind of girl I wish I was.  She's <br />
positively tiny, at an inch under 5', and she's very cute, with a nice figure, where I'm, well, <br />
to be nice, a stick.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that I've been a tomboy since I could walk.  Dad was a mechanic, and I <br />
practically grew up in the garage.  Still, I guess I never could be a girly-girl like Naomi; I <br />
like fixing things too much.  I've always had a talent for it, my Dad used to grin real wide <br />
and say I could fix anything.<br />
<br />
When Dad died, I got the house, and I spend a lot of time in his garage; the smell of oil <br />
and metal reminds me of him a lot.  I really should get a job, or go back to college, but it's <br />
been hard.  Mom died when I was little, so I barely remember her, but it feels like Dad is <br />
still here.<br />
<br />
To keep myself busy, I've been fixing things around the house, tuning up Dad's 69' <br />
Camaro, and doing odd jobs around the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
It was just such a job that introduced me to Jenny Carter.  I had just finished doing an oil <br />
change for a kid across the street, Mike, who'd just got his license, along with a beat-up <br />
Chrysler that I didn't think would last two years.  <br />
<br />
He didn't know a thing about cars, but I could tell he loved that beater.  I smiled, thinking <br />
of my first car, the Charger.<br />
<br />
I wasn't feeling very girly at the moment, wearing my old coveralls, covered in oil and <br />
grease, and my brown hair under a hat, and all I was thinking about was a long shower <br />
and the fact that Mark would be by for the weekend, when I realized I wasn't alone.<br />
<br />
There was a girl of about six watching me.  She had a pink Huffy bike, and the chain was <br />
dragging on the ground.  She was, no doubt, the prettiest girl I'd ever seen.  Long blonde <br />
hair, so blonde it looked almost white, sapphire blue eyes, and skin the color of cream.  <br />
She smiled at me, revealing a full mouth of baby teeth in perfect condition.  <br />
<br />
By now, she's started losing them, but at that moment, her smile was beautiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot;  She beamed at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...hi...can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom says you fix things, could you fix my bike?  I can pay you two dollars for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn't take long, no need to pay me.&quot;  I grinned.<br />
<br />
She shook her head and replied, her voice all serious.  &quot;If you fix it, I have to pay you, it's <br />
the right thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to admit, Jenny is the most mature little girl I ever met.  I was pretty impressed so I <br />
nodded.  &quot;Ok, no problem.  By the way, I'm Jo.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wrinkled her little nose.  &quot;That name doesn't sound pretty enough for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before I could say a word, the smile was back.  &quot;I'm Jenny Carter.&quot;  She held out her hand, <br />
and didn't seem bothered when I shook it, getting engine grease on her hand.   I tried to <br />
be careful, she was wearing this adorable pink blouse and a denim skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to meet you, Jenny.&quot;  It took about a minute to fix the chain, and she immediately <br />
presented me with two bucks in quarters, with another one of those heart melting smiles.<br />
<br />
And then she was gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Later that night, my doorbell rang, and I answered it to find a vaguely familiar young <br />
woman outside.  She smiled, and I realized at once that this was Jenny's mom, Melissa, <br />
who lived down the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear you fixed Jenny's bike, Miss Franklin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, call me Jo...did you want the money back?  I didn't want to take it, but she insisted...&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt myself blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, nothing like that.  I just wanted to thank you, you made quite an impression on <br />
her.  She says she wants to fix things when she grows up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I didn't get her dress dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa grinned.  &quot;Don't worry about it.  She's very careful.  Not at all like I was at her age, I <br />
was a real tomboy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sheepishly raised a hand.  &quot;I still am.&quot;<br />
<br />
We both laughed, and that's how I got to be friends with the Carters.<br />
<br />
Ethan Carter had died in an accident a few years back, leaving Melissa to raise a little girl <br />
by herself; I was surprised to find out she was only 24.  At their insistence, I started going <br />
over to the Carter house for dinner every night, and Jenny became the little sister I never <br />
had.<br />
<br />
I was glad to help Melissa out, babysitting and such, although I hated to take any money <br />
for it; Jenny could take care of herself just fine.<br />
<br />
Melissa had quite a bit of insurance money, but with my help, she was able to go back to <br />
school.  And I had to admit, she was a better cook than I was; my idea of cuisine was <br />
ordering out for pizza.<br />
<br />
Mike seemed amused at my new family, but he seemed to understand how badly I needed <br />
to be with supportive people.  Naomi, on the other hand, absolutely adored Jenny, and <br />
would often drag us both out shopping.<br />
<br />
So far, I guess my story sounds pretty tame.  But my friendship with little Jenny Carter was <br />
about to change my life completely around.</p>
