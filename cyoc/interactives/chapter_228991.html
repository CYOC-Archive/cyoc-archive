<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lauren looked into the full-body mirror his aunt got for him, and was thoroughly disappointed in his body still being so effeminate. It wasn&#39;t like he had a problem looking like a girl, especially with how much he honest-to-God did. His fluttering eyelashes perfectly covered his round eyes, and his heart-shaped lips were big enough to look like he was ready to kiss at all times. His torso was a bit chubby, with big enough breasts to look like boobs, although his body as a whole was a nice lite 130 lbs. The lack of hair below his eyelashes (minus the neck-length mess of a bob) made his body silky soft to touch and feel, especially his thighs. They were plump and smooth, like if they were made of a crossbreed between silk and cotton, and worked through the pipeline that was his form-fitting leggings. Men wish they could lie down on these bad boys. And his ass-<br />
OH his ass. Lauren&#39;s waist was small to the point that everything below it would have inevitably looked big, but even by Average Jane standards, he had a butt that people could suffocate in. Each cheek was the size of an actual cake, and perfectly rounded like the ones at retail bakeries. Ironic, given that it was all natural and not paid to be lifted with the fat he had (he had gotten ultrasounds in the past because it was so big and his parents were worried it was ass cancer that just happened to look sexy). Compared to his thighs, His hips were wide as fuck, like he was destined to give birth at some point, but given that he was a boy- a cis one at that -that would be impossible.<br />
Speaking of which, Lauren&#39;s genitals; you&#39;d think with how girly the rest of his body is, his boy parts would be small technicalities. Except no, these things were <b>ginormous.</b> The dick was a foot long with a 5 inch girth when flaccid. When completely erect, he was an added 8 inches in length and 3 inches in width. And then there were his pouches, or more accurately, shopping bags. His nuts pulled his sack down past his knees, and would have been constantly kneed if his hips didn&#39;t spread his legs out. The weapon-sized cock and balls were too big for pants or underwear, so he always had to wear skirts or dresses while going commando. This posed other problems, such as his cock occasionally leaking on the floor or it pushing and pulling the skirt forward, but years of intuitive thinking, specialty-made condoms, and belts kept anyone outside of him and his parents from finding out the embarassing truth. At least as a girl, he didn&#39;t have to justify his ass pulling the back of his clothes, and he got some cool gifts from horny men like mirrors and hair products.<br />
<br />
...So yeah, Lauren was basically an extremely cute babe in just about everyway, minus his extremely big balls and baton. Growing up was troublesome and angsty, but he got the chance to fuel his into something productive, and now he&#39;s got a steady living off of digital art. There was a sense of relief and acceptance with himself when he completed a work, even if they have never correlated with his specific issues. He&#39;d made some friends with people who were men (or at the very least said they were), which was a rare treat outside of family and the boyfriends of his girl friends. He could casually talk about being a man and always being a man without it getting weird or uncomfortable.<br />
That said, Lauren always wanted to be more normal. He still wanted to be sexy and hung, but something more manageable that doesn&#39;t require a XXL belt around his thigh. Sadly, it looks like he was still a closeted weeb&#39;s wet dream.<br />
Between the 5 short hours of commissions he had and the 10 long minutes of disappointment, Lauren decided to call it a night and plopped his bodacious booty back on his bed. He tossed &quot;The Controller of Remote&quot; onto his bookshelf; maybe tomorrow he&#39;ll see if the rest of the device is worth keeping and not selling off. The old t-shirts he wore were the only pajamas he had, and he hadn&#39;t cum on this freshly dried Golden Animatronic Rabbit one so it was good enough to sleep in. Even if it was . After making sure his Night Condom was holding his dick tightly to prevent a wet bed, Lauren gave a heavy sigh before shutting his eyes.<br />
<br />
The remote, having had its random button pushed while facing a book that was now a tie-in to a horror game franchise, throbbed slowly with every passing minute. It sounded to it that its current body might be thrown away, so it had to find another electronic to stay usable. It used its inaudible wavelengths to communicate its existence to Lauren&#39;s computer, phone, & TV. Its powers were wired to them and then in between them, behind a layer of reality that makes it unsensible to any blind man. If Lauren gets rid of the remote, it can transfer all it is to the systems in her room, and can offer its capabilities to Lauren until he sees its worth.</p>
