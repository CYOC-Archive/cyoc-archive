<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want you to choose for me.  Make me into whatever you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Liam and Tye were surprised by that, though Brian only saw Liam&#39;s reaction.  The stable boy grinned.  &quot;Are you serious?  I need to match up a Belgian gelding for a nobleman&#39;s team.  Would you let me do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike nodded.  &quot;Can I see what you are making me into first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  Liam directed him to a stall in the back where a magnificent golden tan horse with cream-colored mane and tail stood calmly.  &quot;He&#39;s five, well trained, and gets the best care.  His owner wants a matched team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike admired the horse and nodded again.  &quot;OK!  What do you want me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm.&quot; The stable boy seemed a little flustered.  &quot;I&#39;ve never had anyone willing before.  If we go into his stall and I groom you, it will be easier for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike grinned.  &quot;No problem!&quot;  <br />
<br />
The boy opened the stall gate, and Mike found there was room for both him and his soon-to-be twin to stand comfortably.  The horse snuffled at him, and then rubbed his head against Mike&#39;s side.  &quot;Good!  He likes you.&quot;  Liam shut the gate and puled out some fancy-looking brushes with gold handles.  <br />
<br />
Tye watched invisibly, fascinated even though he was also a little annoyed.  Mike obviously did not take any of this seriously, and the party was going to be minus a centaur fighter before they even got started.  On the other hand, Tye was curious about seeing Mike transformed into a normal animal, something the centaur probably thought was just a temporary adventure. <br />
<br />
The stable boy started brushing Mike&#39;s side, the glowing bristles rapidly changing the hide to match the Belgian&#39;s.  Mike twisted around to watch, enjoying the odd sensations of transformation. He&#39;d be a horse for a while, and then try something else.  Maybe a minotaur, or a satyr.  This was all just a game anyway.  Might as well make the most of it.<br />
<br />
It took very little time to convert Mike&#39;s equine portion into a match for the Belgian beside him.  Contact with the horse appeared to help a lot, and the animal nuzzled and snuffled more as Mike&#39;s scent started to match his own.  Tye expected Mike to have second thoughts when Liam moved behind him with a glowing silver knife.  The centaur did frown, but only asked &quot;Is this going to hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam shook his head.  &quot;Not a bit.  This gelding knife is special - it heals instantly.  And you won&#39;t even remember what sex felt like.: He hefted Mike&#39;s swollen ballsack.  &quot;I have a friend who wants these.  And your cock.  So it won&#39;t be wasted.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mike strained to see, but could not see past his own body.  &quot;When are you going to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam stepped back into view, hoisting the severed black orbs in his hand.  &quot;Done!&quot;  He placed them in the corner and then moved beside Mike.  &quot;Just one more cut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike shivered in anticipation, even though he had felt nothing and had no sensation of anything missing.  His cock began the push out under the attentions of Liam&#39;s hand, and he was fully erect in short order.  This time Mike could see the massive mottled pink and black shaft hanging down, and felt Liam&#39;s hand support the lower portion.  The knife flicked underneath, and then Mike no longer felt the hand.  or the rest of his cock, which now hung over Liam&#39;s hand like a massive sausage.  Mike shook his hindquarters, but nothing felt unusual.  His short penis wiggled, providing the same sensation it always had.  Liam chuckled as he lay the thick shaft next to the testicles. &quot;This is usually the hard part.  I never had a guy give up sex forever willingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike shrugged.  &quot;It&#39;s just as long as I am the horse, right?&quot;  Liam gave him a curious look.  &quot;Uh, right.  But that&#39;s pretty much what you will be from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Belgian lipped at Mike&#39;s side, his lips creating a swatch of horsehide in their wake.  The gelding had attuned Mike so much that just contact with the animal was finishing him up.  However, Liam moved to the front and started brushing Mike&#39;s chest.  Mike watched the hide spread over his human parts as they changed shape.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How long will I be a Belgian?&quot;  Mike was feeling content now, curiously connected to the huge gelding beside him.  Tye knew the former human&#39;s mind was beginning to change, linking with and altering to match the animal&#39;s.  <br />
<br />
Liam looked puzzled as he groomed Mike&#39;s human chest into an equine neck, the arms shrinking into sticks that drew into Mike&#39;s body.  The transformation was very fast now, and the centaur would be a true beast in minutes.  &quot;Your master uses magic to keep his animals healthy and strong.  You&#39;ll live a good 20 years, maybe longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tye was tempted to enlighten Mike while he could still comprehend what he had done.  The change to a horse was permanent, and more importantly, the matching would include the Belgian&#39;s mind.  Wen Liam was done, there would be two identical geldings with the same body and thoughts.  Mike&#39;s awareness, but as a well trained young Belgian Gelding with no comprehension of anything else.<br />
<br />
Mike seemed to finally be catching on, now that the end was near.  &quot;Huh?&quot;  His voice was rough, and his face was beginning to push outward.  &quot;I&#39;ll be a horse for 20 years, but what about after?&quot;  There was a hint of concern, not yet fear.<br />
<br />
Liam stepped back.  He no longer had to use the brush.  Mike was finishing up just form contact with his twin, the powerful transformation magic drawing on the animal for the final pattern that would be Mike.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Maybe there&#39;s an animal afterlife?  Whatever happens, it will be the same as any born horse faces.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confusion flickered again in eyes that enlarged and spread as Mike&#39;s skull thickened into that of a Belgian.  His face was a muzzle, and as Liam watched in satisfaction. Mike&#39;s head, and the rest of him, completed the change.  The only difference was in the eyes, which held a brightness of intelligence that also faded after another minute.<br />
<br />
Mike could not work up fear, feeling too calm and content.  Something had changed, but as his nostrils filled with the identical scent of his brother and his mind slowed and simplified, the Belgian gelding that had been a centaur, and a human before that, forgot everything that wasn&#39;t part of being a horse.</p>
