<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yeah.. mmmph.. if you don&#39;t mind, Ketill.&quot; Lars spoke into the phone, the man on the other end with his vaguely Icelandic accent, though that was his tribe. He and his brother had agreed to come to the resort to help with the aquatics program. &quot;I told him..&quot; Lars&#39; toes curled as he let out a little shuddering sigh, trying not to do it right into the phone. &quot;He could use the pool after hours. You just...&quot; The fox squirmed. &quot;Need to be there for insurance reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lars bit his lip and moved the phone away from his muzzle as Ketill asked a question. &quot;Yeah, the VIP treatment. Trust me, you&#39;ll like this one. I&#39;m the best ma..ahh..ahh..&quot; Yip. &quot;Bet matchmaker in the resort. Gotta go!&quot; Lars hung up the phone and kicked at Tom&#39;s shoulder with his foot.<br />
<br />
Tom just smiled up at Lars, the smaller fox&#39;s cock in front of him, licking it like his favorite flavor of popsicle. &quot;While I was on the phone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Payback for the tail pulling. Who were you talking to anyway?&quot; Tom said with no apology in his tone, giving Lars&#39; swollen cock another thorough lick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just Ketill, down at the pool. Chase wanted to so swimming when it wasn&#39;t so crowded.&quot; Lars peered at Tom, then grinned. &quot;Fine! We can make up with another werefox ritual, how about.. the Ritual of the Eternal Circle?&quot; Lars said brightly as he crawled forward on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re making things up again.&quot; Tom said with a bright smile, then frowned. &quot;Chase? What did you?&quot; He swatted at Lars&#39; ear when the fox got his muzzle down to Tom&#39;s cock and startle lapping at it. &quot;Stop trying to distract me. What did you tell him to do to Chase?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Lars had a look of such beatific innocence on his face Tom almost burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, so this ritual.&quot; Tom sighed, Lars could be as stubborn as a mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you keep doing what you were doing so expertly. And I do the same down here.&quot; Lars murmured as he took another lick of Tom&#39;s cock making the taller fox shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love. I think this is just sixty-nineing.&quot; Tom said with a smile, though he did take Lars into his muzzle, enjoying making his mate squirm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s the..&quot; Lars sucked in a gasp of air, &quot;Ritual of the Eternal Circle, best werefox apology ritual there is.&quot; Lars let out a little squeak as Tom&#39;s tongue danced along his swelling knot. It was not fair how good Tom was with that tongue.<br />
<br />
------- <br />
<br />
Chase stepped into the blessedly empty pool. It was an indoor pool, and well heated, but the ceiling was mostly glass to give a view of the arctic sky and it&#39;s famous lights. He had taken up swimming a few months ago in an effort to get fit. His last boyfriend had dumped him for some meat head with muscle and it had hit Chase where it hurt. He new he was a nerd, but people didn&#39;t have to rub it in. he problem was he was still a little self-conscious of being at the pool and liked to go n the very early morning or late evening when it was mostly empty.<br />
<br />
He figured if he was doing a favor for the resort owners, he could get one in return. He couldn&#39;t complain much about them insisting at least one life guard was there. But he came up short when he saw the lifeguard in question. Lifeguards in general were hunky, but something about the man that was sitting on the reception desk just before the locker rooms had his heart beating loud in his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Chase!&quot; The man said brightly, his English good, but his accent slightly different than most he had heard up here. &quot;I&#39;m Ketill. Lars told me to give you the full VIP treatment.&quot; Ketill had a definite swimmers build, broad shoulders and chest, strong arms and legs, and just a sleekness to his form that all natural swimmers seemed to have. Strangely his muscles while obvious seemed to be lacking some tone, as if he had a very thin layer of fat between his muscles and skin, softening the harsh lines of muscle definition into something smoother and more naturally sleek. He was dressed as Chase expected from a lifeguard, in red trunks and a white tank, his only hair a messy mop of brown on the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, thanks for coming down, I&#39;ve been busy during the day and couldn&#39;t come down for my usual swim time.&quot; Chase felt the lie didn&#39;t hurt, and he didn&#39;t want to appear silly in front of this hunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it, I come down here, too, after hours. I just have a key.&quot;  Ketill hopped off the counter and Chase was surprised to see he wasn&#39;t actually all that tall, maybe 5&#39;8&quot;, he did have oddly large hands and feet though. Probably part of him being a good swimmer. &quot;Chase said full VIP treatment, so first.&quot; He dug behind the counter and pulled out a large brown towel, neatly folded. &quot;Plushest microfiber towel you&#39;ll ever find!&quot; He shoved it into Chase&#39;s hands. &quot;Compliments of the resort.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase ran his fingers on the towel. It felt more like a fleecy blanket than a towel, and was indeed surprisingly soft. Ketill motioned him to follow, so he did as he took him through the locker rooms and into the pool. There was something peaceful about empty pools at night and this one was no different. Ketill sat on the edge of the pool with his feet in the water, smiling a strange little smile as he watched Chase.<br />
<br />
Chase muttered under his breath as he dropped his stuff on one of the pool chairs. He had wanted to come afterhours to not be self conscious. No he had to flail around in the water with the hunky, Nordic lifeguard of the year award winner staring at him. Taking off his glasses to turn most of the world into an indistinct blur helped.<br />
<br />
Chase swam his laps in quiet, the only other sound being the occasional splash of water as Ketill kicked his feet. Chase finally started wearing out, part of his plan with swimming was to build his stamina up, too, and pulled himself out of the water dripping wet. He grabbed his new towel and wrapped it around himself. It was so warm, even if it did seem to cling to him. He tried to move it to start drying off, but couldn&#39;t. It was like it had become stuck to him where he wrapped it around his shoulders.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t move it, but it felt like it was sliding over him. The brown fuzzy towel moving down his arms and legs, he could even feel it sliding over his head like a hood. He started breathing heavily. Why wasn&#39;t Ketill doing anything? What was happening. Suddenly the world snapped into focus without his glasses. He could see!<br />
<br />
He looked down at his arms. It wasn&#39;t the towel stretching over him, he was growing a thick, short pelt of brown fur. It reached his hands and they twitched, growing a bit larger as webbing grew in between the digits, small black claws forming at the tips of his fingers. Down at the bottom of his legs his feet were repeating the trick, toes elongating with webbing and sprouting little claws. He stumbled backwards in shock and landed in the water with a splash.<br />
<br />
He felt his nostrils shut as if by reflex and felt at his face. His nose and mouth had pushed ot into a short muzzle, and he could feel his teeth changing to sharp points with his tongue. He opened his eyes, expecting just darkness and bubbles, but he could see under he water. It wasn&#39;t bright, but even the dim light was enough to make out he pool and his own body. Brown fur sprouted along his chest which was growing thicker and broader with the change, not as fit as the hunky lifeguard above, but more than he had a moment ago.<br />
<br />
Calming down, he found it strangely easy to just float in the water. What had happened to him. He held his webbed hands up in front of his face. It was like seeing when Tom.. They didn&#39;t. Not to him! He surfaced and grabbed the edge of the pool, his head popped free of the water and he came face to face with the grinning visage of a seal. Well, mostly seal, he had his chin resting in a webbed hand as he watched with an amused smile. &quot;You like it?&quot; He asked, the seal&#39;s voice having a slight barking quality to it, but the accent was unmistakable, as was the white and red lifeguard outfit that lay discarded next to his nude form. Ketill.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do? What was that?&quot; Chase growled as he confronted the seal, who just laughed softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Selkie skin. We keep a few spares on hand if ours goes missing. I lent you one of mine. Lars said full VIP treatment.&quot; He chuckled again. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can take it off whenever. I&#39;ll show you how. But wouldn&#39;t you like to enjoy it a bit, first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Chase asked, running a webbed hand over the damp fur on his chest. It did feel oddly good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lars said you needed to experience something magic for yourself.&quot; Ketill pushed off the edge of the pool, over the tile and right into the water with barely a splash. He surfaced behind Chase, his chest coming to press against the newly transformed man&#39;s back. &quot;Besides, you are very cute like this. I&#39;m glad Lars called me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase could feel his cheeks heating. Cute? This hunk had just called him cute? Arms slipped around him from behind and one teased at a spot below his stomach where the head of his cock was peeking from a slit almost flush with the rest of his body. &quot;You seem to be enjoying it.&quot; Ketill whispered to him.<br />
<br />
Chase slipped away, diving down into the water and slipped through Ketill&#39;s arms. He resurfaced a short distance off, grinning wildly at the selkie. The water felt so natural swirling around him, like he belonged in it, it was a part of him.<br />
<br />
Ketill looked at him quizzically. &quot;Catch me.&quot; He said. He didn&#39;t know why those words came to mind but they did, and it made Ketill burst into a wide smile. Chase shot off, using his new muscles and webbed digits to go shooting through the water. He was sure Ketill could catch him with ease, his experience being what it was, but the seal seemed happy to play with him. Almost getting a hold of him and then letting him slip away.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Chase thought he might have actually lost his play partner for the evening, until arms wrapped around his waist and a muzzle buried itself in his fur. He felt a warmth around his cock, which had been throbbing and eager during their whole game. A tongue lapped along the underside of his shaft and some bubbles escaped him in a silent moan. <br />
<br />
He wrapped his own arms around Ketill, and saw before him that the seal was just as pleased with their game as he was. The throbbing red shaft almost seeming to glow in the water as it bobbed in front of his face. He opened his muzzle and carefully wrapped his lips around it, careful of his newly sharpened teeth.<br />
<br />
The pair of them floated like that for what seemed like a small eternity, each pleasuring the other as they slowly spun below the surface of the water. Soon though, Chase couldn&#39;t keep himself back anymore, and came inside Ketill&#39;s muzzle, soon he was rewarded with Keti&#39;ll seed in his mouth, of which he eagerly lapped up as much as he could. Didn&#39;t want to get the pool dirty after all.<br />
<br />
They both broke the surface a few moments later, Ketill swimming in close to lock muzzles with Chase. It was such an unfamiliar feeling but it felt so good at the same time, like he had been missing out on something until now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are here through New Year&#39;s, ja?&quot; Ketill asked with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it seems.&quot; Chase replied as he drifted over to the side of the pool, crossing his arms on the edge to float there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you keep that skin till then. We can go for more midnight swims.&quot; Ketill grabbed on to the edge of the pool next to Chase, whiskers twitching as he waited for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might like that.&quot;</p>
