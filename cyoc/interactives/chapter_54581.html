<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You sleep in there with the pups?&quot; Gillian II gasped as they followed Martha and Whitney, who had taken over the duties of seeing the group to bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, our room adjoins the pup's room,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;as the Pack's nannies, we need to be as close to them as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then turned and gave Giselle and Gretchen a lick with each head. The two gold pups licked their mother back.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it does give us some advantages that the pack's other mothers at present do not have,&quot; Martha finished, &quot;We are always close to our children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight, mommy,&quot; Giselle and Gretchen chorused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight dears, remember not to wake Alpha Jensen's pups, both by Alpha Kaylee and the Betas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giselle and Gretchen nodded. Giselle lead the way in, but before disappearing Gretchen turned...<br />
<br />
&quot;Com'on Nane! It'll be a sleepover!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nane trotted in, dragging her sisters behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not worry,&quot; Whitney spoke to Mother Glen as she watched the pups begin to file in, &quot;the beds in there are more then big enough to house them all. Jensen and Kaylee's pups sleep together, and the Beta's daughters sleep in the reflection of the same bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until when they reach puberty and you move them to the rooms assigned to the teen wolves,&quot; Mother Glen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you wish a room for yourself, or do you wish to stay with Mr. P?&quot; Ryan asked, he wasn't in front, but he was still present.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will go with Gill,&quot; Mother Glen told him, &quot;keep him company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma, I don't need to hear that,&quot; Penny protested, finding it hard to get the image of her grandmother mating out of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm too tired to do anything of THAT nature,&quot; Gillian II told Penny, &quot;where will you be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought to take her to the room that I normally share with Yamato and my sister wives,&quot; Umeko spoke, &quot;Eri will have the night shift tonight, but Akane should be heading to bed soon. That way we can look after Penny-san should she need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd suppose that'd work,&quot; Penny shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Although for warning,&quot; Umeko spoke again, &quot;despite her temper, Akane likes to cuddle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny gulped at being cuddled by someone in their sleep, and the other one not knowing who she was cuddling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will sleep between me and her,&quot; Penny instructed, &quot;I wouldn't want to do anything that might spread rumors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
One night in early 1676...<br />
<br />
Goldwyn found the dream-scape somewhat different from before. Buildings seemed older, and the church in the praying town looked like it had a life sized cross with a wooden figure that looked like her foster father nailed to it. Looking down at herself, she saw that she looked older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goldwyn, is that you?&quot; a voice asked.<br />
<br />
She turned to see Gita and Griselle standing there... both as adult women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters what happened to you!?&quot; Goldwyn gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a future you see,&quot; Herodias spoke from the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;A future?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The future is always in motion,&quot; Herodias explained, &quot;and it changes with every action taken in the present... proving these Christians that believe in Predestination to be absolute idiots.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're idiots for all their rules,&quot; Goldwyn spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this place... Hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned to see a lone blond woman wearing what appeared to be dark clothing. Under her arm was the raven mask they had seen before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such darkness, such evil,&quot; the woman gasped as she walked down the street. She walked toward the church and seemingly recognized the statue of of the crucified man, &quot;such sacrilege in front of a house of God!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They brought it on themselves!&quot; Goldwyn told the woman, coming close, &quot;Oppressing people with their rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it is right murder people? To steal from them? To covet that which is not yours?&quot; the woman, Marie retorted, &quot;that is the right way that will make everything better? Humanity would vanish completely as people murder each other indiscriminately. That is why we have rules. To protect that which is good from that which is evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You lie!&quot; Goldwyn screamed, &quot;rules killed Joella. If that wolf had let me do as I pleased, then there wouldn't have been a problem. I wasn't hurting anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lupman are protective of their territories and their perception of their territories,&quot; Marie answered, remembering learning from Lobo why he was with the church, &quot;if you were trespassing, which is a crime, it doesn't matter what you were doing. To the lupman, you could have been plotting to kill his pups or drive off his food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He had no right to know the truth,&quot; Gita spoke taking a flanking position beside Goldwyn while Griselle moved to the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you'll defend the evil laws, then we're afraid you're just as evil as they are!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Marie noticed the eyes of a crow, a large red boa, and a black cat glow, she screamed.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Marie shot up in her bed as she shook her head. This dream was much more like a nightmare. A town cloaked in darkness, its church desecrated with what looked like the carving of a native american human nailed to a cross. And the same three girls she had dreamed of before as adults and withes saying that rules were bad. Some were bad, in Marie's opinion... but she also had to admit that they were important and necessary. <br />
<br />
Without them, there would be bigger troubles. And as her godfather had taught her, even the ones she didn't like were there to test how fair she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was them, the same three,&quot; Marie gasped as she gripped herself, &quot;but how?  It was probably only a nightmare, but why was I seeing the same three... or was that the future?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;She's starting to recognize her second sight,&quot; Lawrence spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Marie nodded, &quot;Father Gabriel had no experience with it, and so Marie Cruz had to train herself. But for Marie, as she began to recognize it, she began to see what come in her future... though much of that would come later. The witches, however, quickly associated Marie Cruz with the &quot;evil laws&quot; they were seeking to stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
In the medical area, the &quot;night shift&quot; was reduced as several wolves could finally take no more and went to bed. Penny and Kirk's parents proved to be very diligent as they followed Ingrid, Joy, Darla, and Julie's instructions. The wounded largely did their best to sleep.<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen lay quietly with Fran on one side and Kaylee on the other. He hugged both of them in his sleep. They were both precious to him, and was glad to have both of them along with Darla and Julie.<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
In the pup's room, Mr. P gave Bart, Jenny, Kevin, and Marcy each a loving lick before licking the mirror that Alice and Abbey were sleeping in. He then glanced around the room to see that all the other pups and cubs were sound asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleep well, young ones,&quot; Mr. P whispered as he curled up in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
Giselle meanwhile wondered why her sister had brought Nane into their bed. The cubs all had their own...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Penny slept peacefully on, while Umeko and Akane cuddled. Dreams of herself raising three cubs of her own with Kirk ran through her mind.</p>
