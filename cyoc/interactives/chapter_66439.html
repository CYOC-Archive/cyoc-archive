<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You enter your last class for the day, math, just in time before the teacher arrives. Everyone in the room immediately looks at you strangely, <br />
noticing the clothes you are wearing, they'd never paid attention to you before at all but the change in clothing was pretty obvious, but you didn't <br />
have much choice, that other kid stole your clothes. You look down noticing that thankfully the patch of cum in the underwear isn't showing <br />
through. You ignore them and take a seat at a free desk in the second row.<br />
<br />
Class continues on for a while, then you notice you've started to shuffle your legs at the desk slightly, feeling the warm cream in the pants <br />
moving over your cock and legs. Then you realise that you're actually enjoying it. This instantly startles you; &quot;Don't look so surprised, it was just <br />
the bell.&quot; says the teacher, noticing the startled look on your face. The bell had gone and you remembered the post-it note left by the guy who <br />
stole your clothes. You begin walking to the gym, people moving in opposite direction in the hallway to leave the school as quickly as they can. <br />
You notice a bunch of people looking at you strangely for going the other way, after all, who would want to stay in school longer than needed; <br />
but this was urgent, something was wrong, you notice a guy in the hallway, you feel something in your stomach, something you've only felt for <br />
girls before. You walk faster, and enter the gym.<br />
<br />
It's quieter inside the gym, the shoes you are wearing squeak on the basketball court's flooring. You see the guy who stole your clothes earlier <br />
standing by the change room door, you walk slower towards him, &quot;What's going o......on?!&quot; you stutter as you realise you find this guy <br />
increasingly attractive as the seconds tick. &quot;Follow me.&quot; he says, you notice that he has quite a deep voice, not something you'd expected.<br />
<br />
You follow him into the empty change rooms and he pats the spot next to him on the seats between the showers and lockers. You sit down and <br />
look at his face, he has deep brown eyes and the cutest face you'd ever laid eyes on, his smallish face and his short dark hair all attract your <br />
attention, even the few day old barely visible, patchy, teenage stubble on his face was noticeable to you. Your eyes move down, you notice that <br />
this guy is pretty tall, thin; about 6'3&quot;, explains the poor-fitting clothes you think.<br />
<br />
He looks you right in the eyes, you feel something for him you've never felt before, but you shake it off in your head. &quot;Who are you?&quot; you ask. He <br />
gives a polite grin, &quot;I'm Zach,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm in the 12th grade, same as you, but we have different classes... I'd noticed you around place... I saw <br />
Greg bullying you the other day and I thought you might like some company. Have you noticed... IT?&quot; he asks.<br />
&quot;If you mean this weird thing I keep feeling, then yeah&quot; you say, gulping. &quot;I want to help you.&quot; he says, you feel his long hand rub over yours and <br />
you shudder slightly, your cock springs to attention.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you feel something strange in the underwear you're wearing, you can feel the cum in them moving, soaking. Then you feel it, it's <br />
soaking into you. You feel it all absorb quickly into your half-hard member and your balls. It feels so odd. Zach puts a hand on your back as you <br />
both stand up. You feel an energy moving inside you and it hits your chest where you feel a heat radiating. You rub at the white shirt you are <br />
wearing, you begin to moan as you feel your pecs push out slightly and your flat stomach begins to feel slightly more defined, you lift up your <br />
shirt panting to see a lean body. The energy moves down into your arms and legs. Zach holds you lightly with his arm around your back as you <br />
feel your legs becoming leaner, better fitting the skinny jeans, you hear small popping sounds as your legs grow longer, you arch backwards <br />
slightly as your back lengthens, you notice now that you're eye level with Zach. &quot;Those eyes...&quot; you think as you feel your arms grow longer, you <br />
feel your biceps pulsate as they become lean and toned, your forearms begin to follow, becoming slightly more well defined and stronger. <br />
<br />
You flex your hands a few times as you feel your palms and fingers growing slightly longer and wider to better fit your new height. The same <br />
feeling appears in your feet, you feel them begin to extend outwards, your feet and toes lengthening as they fill the huge size 13 high-tops you <br />
are wearing. The hair on your legs turns slightly darker and a fine coating of hair pushes its way out of your arms.<br />
<br />
Then your neck and head begins to tingle, your neck thins out slightly to better suit your leaner but well-built body, you feel your hair turn a <br />
chestnut brown and become styled as if by invisible hands into a short fauxhawx, much lighter than Zach's jet black, unstyled bed hair. You don't <br />
feel your face change, while you are still moaning from the feelings inside you you feel a little disappointed about your face staying the same, but <br />
you weren't exactly bad looking in the first place, however you do feel your teeth straighten up slightly, strangely unpainfully and you blink as <br />
your eyes turn a deeper blue.<br />
<br />
Then you feel as if you've had an orgasam as you yell while you feel your average cock begin to pulse and thicken and lengthen with each <br />
breathe, snaking its way down your leg to a thick, long, hard 7 inches. You want to come so badly but it wont happen just yet you know in your <br />
head.<br />
<br />
You feel your brain fuzz for a moment, and you realise, that you like guys, you're gay, but you're perfectly fine with it.<br />
<br />
You stand there panting, sweating slightly, you look at your larger hands and you turn to Zach who is still holding you. &quot;Do you like it? I did it just <br />
for you, I wanted you to feel better about yourself.&quot; he says.<br />
You look into his brown eyes and you suddenly lock lips with him, your first kiss. He runs his fingers up your new body and you run yours up his, <br />
you notice he isn't as defined as you are but it doesn't matter, you rub up the light treasure trail on his stomach and you begin to strip. You looks <br />
into each others eyes, the lust you feel is intense, Zach's cute, sexy face lowers down as he gets onto his knees and he begins to suck on your <br />
new large cock. You can somehow tell he's never done this before, but he's a natural, he swallows it whole as you begin to thrust into him, yelling <br />
as you unload your cum into him. The best orgasm you've ever had.<br />
<br />
Sitting next to each other afterwards you ask &quot;Am I only one that this has worked on? Can it work on someone else?&quot;. &quot;Sure can&quot;, Zach says, <br />
&quot;Pretty sure you're contagious now.&quot; he adorably chuckles to himself.<br />
<br />
You open one of the lockers marked 'Brett', you remember him as another one of Greg's bullied victims, a geeky, lanky 11th grader who was <br />
more pathetic than you ever were. You find a pair of underwear inside, and you smear some of the cum on your cock into the underwear. &quot;What <br />
are you doing?&quot; Zach asks. &quot;Maybe we can help someone else.&quot; you reply. &quot;Okay... but we're not getting involved&quot; Zach says, unsure. &quot;Fine with <br />
me!&quot; you reply, throwing the underwear back into the locker and closing it. You both leave, and you know that Brett will appreciate the <br />
anonymous gesture awaiting him in his locker.</p>
