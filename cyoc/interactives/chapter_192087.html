<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being that Hank had grown so much - and in fact aged quite a bit - he was no longer quite fitted into the clothes he used to wear. Eric himself knew they were going to also need new clothes for him pretty soon too. These ones were not suited for a big, bulky jock. He felt his gut rubbing the front of the shirt, competing for room due to how tight it was with his sweltering pectorals. Hank for his part however was enjoying the outing, and looking around for something that might fit him now. He was after all bigger, and older.<br />
<br />
Eric groaned as he checked out some clothes, wondering where Kyle ran off to. Guy was probably off screwing around or something. He did need new clothes too, but his were even bigger it seemed than what Hank might require.<br />
<br />
Whereas Eric had become a tall and bulky, brawny young man, thick in muscle but also in gut and girth, Hank had become more lean and muscular, growing into a powerfully built countenance that nonetheless maintained an appealing aesthetic. If Eric could describe it as anything, it was a slightly younger version of Kyle&#39;s body. Slightly - due to the fact it seemed that one possible effect of the jacket was that people tended to grow older when they wore it.<br />
<br />
An interesting proposition - and a potentially intriguing trade off. He started to wonder how long Hank would be able to keep going before something happened to sort him off into high school. &quot;Hey dude!&quot; Hank shouted as he looked at some clothes. Eric guessed Hank was probably about 17 or so, and seemed very eager about the changes. Whereas most kids might be at least a little worried about losing youth like that, it seemed Hank loved it.<br />
<br />
Eric tilted his head, &quot;Yeah? What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I like the clothes in this one!&quot; Hank gestured toward the store.<br />
<br />
Eric crossed his arms in front of his chest - that was Arborwell&#39;s, a pretty sporty local brand of clothes. Lots of tank tops and stringer shirts, as well as other fitness items. He wasn&#39;t exactly surprised that Hank was drawn toward it - after all, it seemed another additional effect was that the individual in question certainly got more enthused about their fitness or sports availability. &quot;Let&#39;s check it out then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think Kyle might let me have the jacket again soon?&quot; Hank said with a smirk, &quot;I&#39;m thinking I need some more size to grow into some of these shirts!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve grown enough,&quot; Eric responded somewhat brusquely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, what a killjoy, man!&quot; Hank shrugged but then figured he could just workout hard so he could get up to the level he&#39;d need to be for some of these shirts.<br />
<br />
As the two of them entered, they would see that the colors and items included were very, very athletically inclined and some even directed toward the bodybuilding subculture...and the colors were vibrant - some even outright flamboyant, the messages plenty inclusive as well. That was when the pair were approached by the counter manager, an athletic young man with the good looks of a model. His hair was golden blond and gelled back, eyes light gray, and his body was very well muscled indeed - owing to his fitness shorts and revealing stringer shirt, the two jocks would see that the young man probably did manscape his body hair away.<br />
<br />
He smoothly smiled, &quot;Welcome to Arborwell&#39;s, the premier local store for fitness and bodybuilding equipment. My name&#39;s Chase Holman, and I&#39;ll be up for helping you find any goods you guys might want.&quot; Seeing the two of them seemed to be older teen jocks, Chase smirked, &quot;You boys aiming to impress a guy or a girl with your purchases today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Hank was, despite his newfound maturity, still rather shy about that sort of thing, &quot;There&#39;s...a girl I like, I think. And there&#39;s lots of girls at high school who I&#39;d like to impress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric admitted he was starting to find some of this stuff pretty appealing too, and he asked, &quot;Do you have anything for a guy my size?&quot; He gestured at his belly and then at the heavily built muscled lining the rest of his frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, we got stuff fit for linebackers. Lemme show you. You good to look around uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hank.&quot; Hank answered, blushing a little. He knew he liked girls. He knew that from experience. But even still, he couldn&#39;t help but think to himself that Chase was a very attractive guy. Was---was Chase also impressed by his muscles? That strange thought rippled through the young man settling between his finished state and his old one.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Eric was looking at some clothes - some heavy cargo pants, a big old tank top that readily admitted room for his gut as well as his muscles, a new hat that he loved, and a brand letter jacket. All of which ACTUALLY fit him! They were as of now away from the entrance, and toward the fitting rooms. Chase was looking at some more items and accessories, and he said, &quot;Feel free to try it on, dude. Don&#39;t worry about like, weirding me out here. I&#39;ve seen it before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Eric murmured, checking to make sure nobody else was coming inside the store before stripping down to his boxers. He gulped when he registered Chase whistling at the sight of him, but then he went ahead and tried all the clothes on then and there. So much for fitting rooms, he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was...?&quot; Eric asked, just in time for Chase to playfully move over and rub Eric&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a nice ass on you, bro,&quot; Chase whispered, &quot;Girlfriends probably like all the thrust action this and your big-ass legs give.&quot; He seemed to be...into Eric?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what&#39;re you...?&quot; Eric asked, a little bit confused. And somehow, a little excited. There was something distinctly unusual about this that was also kind of exciting. Eric distinctly remembered fooling around mostly with women. But Chase seemed...what was he even trying to say or do with this? There was an element of unsure sexuality to this. A sort of &quot;is it all leading to a jock style no homo brah moment? Or is it something more&quot;?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem, right?&quot; Chase smiled broadly, &quot;We&#39;re two buff dudes, we can appreciate each others&#39; bodies. And I can really see the work that goes into your physique.&quot; Another pat, this time on Eric&#39;s belly. He saw how Eric was responding to him, awkwardly shifting in place and dealing with arousal from the touching and strangely intimate nature of this.<br />
<br />
Chase whispered, &quot;Oh...somebody&#39;s looking excited. How about we just...appreciate each other in the fitting room. Today seems slow. I think it&#39;d be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I---I uhh...&quot; Eric murmured, it seemed Hank was distracted by the sheer variety of stuff to try on here...and Eric was not sure what to do with this. <i>I&#39;m...I&#39;m straight...right?</i><br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile as Eric dealt with his sexuality and Hank tried to find a way to look more mature, Kyle was just as well having quite an experience at the big and tall section. The woman at the front was a wavy haired, buxom blond woman named Clara whose brother it seemed managed another store there. But as far as she was concerned, as soon as she saw Kyle it seemed she had fallen for him. He had not known it seemed how good it felt to have someone literally swooning over you. And now, Kyle was eager to try for something.<br />
<br />
Clara looked at the pile of clothes that Kyle brought over, and remarked, &quot;Damn...you really are quite a fine hunk of a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle chuckled, &quot;I get that a lot, admittedly. You&#39;re not too bad looking yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, looking outward, &quot;...My brother would probably <i>adore</i> you. His name&#39;s Chase. He&#39;s kind of a funny story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaning against the desk, Kyle smiled at her flirtatiously, thinking he was getting closer moment by moment to this, &quot;Really? Why not tell it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Clara explained, readily imagining Kyle without all these clothes - or really any clothes at all - on, &quot;He&#39;s bisexual. He&#39;d never admit it. But he&#39;s really into buff guys like you...might just run in the family. Because hot DAMN...&quot; she looked at how tall he was, and asked, &quot;How...big are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt his cock give an interested pulse at the question, &quot;I&#39;m...it seems I&#39;m about six foot ten inches tall. Easily one of the biggest guys on the team bar none. Unless you meant how big THESE are...&quot; He promptly flexed his biceps, delighting in how Clara immediately reached out and touched one of them just from him flexing like that. Yeah, it seemed she liked his body quite a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have anywhere private?&quot; Kyle asked with a licentious grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a private fitting room in the back. I was thinking about it, but you really made my decision for me, big man.&quot; Clara started heading back toward there, and Kyle followed, eagerly taking everything with him. Chances were he would indeed need those new clothes after this. Because hot damn was he feeling the arousal kick in.<br />
<br />
But as the two of them entered the room, he pondered the jock jacket. He wondered if he might be able...no, no. Going any further might not be wise. Wasn&#39;t he big enough as he was already? But Clara was hot, and she was into him, and a very kinky idea was playing out in Kyle&#39;s mind. He was thinking of fucking her while wearing JUST the jacket. It made him feel a hot pulse of arousal through his dick, and made him waver on his feet...</p>
