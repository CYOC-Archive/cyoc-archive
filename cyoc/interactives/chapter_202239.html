<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marlene Rollins felt like she&#39;d won the fucking lottery as she marched up the pathway to her first day at Morgan Chemical. She&#39;d been skeptical of her chances when she applied for this internship - yeah, sure, the plain-looking brunette had some excellent grades and ambitions to match, but there were so many other people applying for this same position. Yet she&#39;d thrown her hat into the ring anyway, and somehow, the slim odds had worked out - she was about to start a tenure learning and working under one of the best chemists in the entire country, and her resume was going to be a killer once she&#39;d finished up her degree.<br />
<br />
Granted, the woman herself was... eccentric. Quite frankly, some of the information that Dr. Morgan had asked her for had been utterly bizarre, to the point Marlene still couldn&#39;t figure out what the hell those questions had to do with an internship. But hey, the most brilliant people tended to be a bit odd in their own ways, right? Sam Morgan was still a globally-respected scientist, and what&#39;s more, she&#39;d taken a shine to the eager young grad student - maybe seeing a bit of herself in Marlene? It was egotistical, sure, but quite possible regardless.<br />
<br />
As soon as she stepped through the doors, she found the doctor waiting for her, greeting her with a warm smile and quickly guiding her new protege through the facility, showing off some of the manufacturing rooms and the laboratories where her staff worked to develop and refine new products. Nothing really lingering, though - Dr. Morgan seemed eager to hurry the student through the halls and off to an area with pretty clear &#39;Restricted Access&#39; signs posted. For a moment, Marlene thought about asking if she ought to sign an NDA or something, but quickly shut her mouth<br />
<br />
On the other side of the keypad-locked doors was another laboratory space, this one far more lavish and loaded with top of the line equipment than what she&#39;d seen the staff using. Aside of the expected array of lockers, electronics, and various tools, at the center of the room was a well-padded chair with a futuristic design, looking awfully comfortable. Dr. Morgan quickly ushered Marlene over to sit down in it, and the young woman, not wanting to screw up and disobey her boss on her first day, complied without a word, the doctor nodding and smiling as she began to offer an explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t quite disclosed the full reality behind this position, Miss Rollins,&quot; she began as she picked up a pair of latex gloves and slipped them on, &quot;So allow me to elucidate. I chose you for this internship based on your academic excellence and ambition, this much is true... but there was another reason. I also selected you for your looks.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was... a strange thing, given how plain and unimpressive Marlene was, but Dr. Morgan put up a hand to catch any objections or questions right out the gate. &quot;Please, hold your inquiries. I am aware that you are no supermodel, and this factor, in combination with your intelligence, made you a perfect candidate.&quot; She stepped over to a table and unclasped a small metal case, revealing a syringe filled with some strange pink liquid. &quot;I have been perfecting a solution that will tremendously enhance the sexual appeal of whoever it is administered too - and I would like for you to be my test subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marlene&#39;s brown eyes got a bit wider. &quot;Your... ah....&quot; She blinked rapidly. &quot;I...&quot; She was stammering. Fuck, fuck, fuck. She thought she was getting a job, not being thrust into a human trial for some sort of... what, a libido enhancer, or something? Some kind of aphrodisiac? She wanted to protest, but... as soon as Dr. Morgan turned around and glared at her, all resistance collapsed. If she said no, it seemed inevitable that Morgan would send her away - and what then? She got to be the girl who rejected an opportunity any chemistry student would kill for? She got her name blacklisted forever? This woman could quash her career dreams as easily as she could fulfill them. Marlene didn&#39;t have any real choice here.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds... exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Morgan nodded appreciatively. &quot;Good. Please, roll up your sleeve.&quot; Reluctantly, Marlene complied, the doctor hurrying to prepare the injection site. &quot;You&#39;ll feel a slight sting,&quot; she went on, &quot;But no pain or discomfort afterwards. If anything, you&#39;ll probably feel quiite nice in short order.&quot; She was right about the first part, at least - there was a stinging sensation as she plunged the needle through Marlene&#39;s skin and pushed down on the plunger, sending a flood of the odd magenta solution into the girl&#39;s veins.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should begin to see effects within moments.&quot; As she removed her gloves and grabbed a pen and pencil, she sighed. &quot;There may be... one other side effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marlene was having trouble hiding her concern at this point. &quot;What... kind of side effect, doctor?&quot; She tugged at her shirt&#39;s collar - was the AC not functioning well in this room?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental side effects, Miss Rollins. You may not walk away from this experiment with the same... voracious appeite for learning.&quot; Spotting the fear growing in the girl&#39;s eyes, she reached out and patted her shoulder. &quot;But don&#39;t worry about that. Whatever happens... just enjoy what comes next.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was struggling to puzzle out just how this could be enjoyable as the heat spread over her whole body, leaving her flushed with cheeks a bright shade of red. It wasn&#39;t entirely uncomfortable, though - in fact, she would privately admit to finding the sensation of warmth to be quite nice as it circled around her chest. She dared to dart her eyes down at that part of her body - and then after looking back up, she looked down again, mouth going agape in shock. They felt warm, and... heavier... because they <i>were</i> heavier. Only a little bit, but with the warmth increasing, she swore she could feel the mass increasing as well.<br />
<br />
Dr. Morgan quickly copped onto this, and without a word, she guiding the trembling hands of the student to cup her own breasts through her shirt. Put into that position, she couldn&#39;t hold back the urge to squeeze, and with that groping came a wave of pleasure that reverberated up and down her spine. It was like she could feel her own growing tits right through the shirt - maybe that was because they were so large now, the material of her top was stretching. Biting down on her lip, she waited until a button was dangerously close to popping before she undid it, quickly followed by the rest of the top getting unbuttoned, and hands reaching behind to unclasp her bra.<br />
<br />
They still kept going, and they weren&#39;t the only thing. As a luciously large pair of tits spilled freely, she could feel that same warmth pushing at her back end. A quick glance to her ass affirmed that it was indeed swelling up with fatty tissue just like her breasts, straining her skirt and quickly leaving her a bit stuck inside the confines of the padded chair. She couldn&#39;t claim to be against this at all - illogical as it was, the sheer physical pleasure was kind of thrilling. Far, far beyond anything she had achieved playing with herself, that much was certain.<br />
<br />
It all just felt... wonderful, really, the sensation of her sexual characteristics increasing at this alarmingly fast pace. Her hands squeezed again, fingers pinching her nipples, a moan escaping past lips that were puffing out to become full and delightfully kissable. Her eyes, shifting to a shade of bright blue, were now looking over her increasing mass with excitement, an extra thrill coming as strands of long blonde hair fell into her field of view. It felt fucking great - she adored what was happening, and more and more, she felt the urge to be touched. To feel the pleasure of another, any man or woman, playing with her enormous assets, partaking in the delights of her greatly increased flesh.<br />
<br />
Through it all, Dr. Morgan took careful notes, monitoring as the transformation neared its climax. The arousal and spurt of cum from her folds that signaled completion came once she had been left with two enormous melons, each as big around as a basketball, with a super-wide back end to match. A smile was on her volumnious lips as she looked up at the doctor, and Sam posed the shaky question that would confirm whether or not this whole endeavor had been worthwhile. &quot;Your transformation is complete, Miss Rollins. Tell me... how do you feel about science?&quot; She would know one or two sentences into any response whether or not the intelligence-preserving formula had worked...</p>
