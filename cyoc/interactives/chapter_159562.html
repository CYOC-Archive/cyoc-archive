<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Finally continuing with this story. This chapter was written with The 1&#39;s help. We&#39;ve been mostly stuck on the chapter after this one, but hopefully it won&#39;t take as long to get to.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Try practicing your magic or reading your map,” The titan replied. “That should take your mind off of her.” <br />
 <br />
His posture showed no hesitation as he turned around and walked away.<br />
 <br />
For some reason, the tone of his voice really bugged Nat. It sounded uncaring, almost dismissive. <br />
 <br />
But with nothing better to do, Nat did as she was told. <br />
 <br />
As if her body moved automatically, she sat down under a shady tree, took off her backpack, and pulled out her map of the kingdom and a pen. She might as well take notes of what’s real and what’s on the map while she is here.<br />
 <br />
A part of her doesn’t know why she is doing what Isaac told her. Respect? Hope that he will remember his promise? Fear? Well, whatever it is, Nat couldn’t help but feel her frustration grow with every slow step her mentor took. For some reason, his attitude just pisses her off!<br />
 <br />
She had been patiently and anxiously waiting for lessons from Nathan’s childhood friend. Yet, ever since they left the mansion, Isaac hadn’t once acknowledged that he accepted being her teacher. She figured that he was just waiting for the right time, but he didn’t even mention sword fighting and magic lessons when they took breaks while climbing up the mountain! Rest breaks were the perfect time to train! But even then, they hadn’t ever started their first lesson. <br />
 <br />
To her, it felt as if Isaac was simply procrastinating in being her makeshift instructor. <br />
 <br />
Did he forget?<br />
 <br />
As Nat listened to her would-be mentor’s footsteps getting more and more distance, her patience finally snapped. <br />
 <br />
“Wait.”<br />
 <br />
She didn’t even bother facing him. Ignoring her would just be further confirmation that his promise was empty. <br />
 <br />
While it wasn&#39;t loud, her calm, yet borderline furious tone demanded attention.<br />
 <br />
Fortunately, her voice was heard amidst the forest’s bristling wildlife moving against the mountain wind.<br />
 <br />
At his name, the titan stopped in within earshot of her, but didn&#39;t bother to turn around.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What?&quot; He asked as he clenched his fists in annoyance.<br />
 <br />
But before Nat could say more, she heard a weird sound.<br />
 <br />
*CHIRP! SLURP!*<br />
 <br />
Her brow wrinkled in confusion as she heard some kind of animal from Isaac&#39;s direction. Despite this, she refuses to turn around to see it&#39;s source.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Did I hear a chirp?&quot; Nat asked in a manner her mother used to use when she once tried to take in a kitten.<br />
 <br />
Completely unfazed by Nat&#39;s attempt at sounding strict, he simply chuckled to himself. &quot;Chirp... That&#39;s probably where he got the name from...,&quot; He muttered cryptically.<br />
 <br />
Without waiting for Nat to continue speaking, Isaac resumed his retreat.<br />
 <br />
Nat tried to calmly call out to him again, but this time, she failed to hide the desperation in her voice. &quot;Stop!&quot;<br />
 <br />
The titan&#39;s form slowly spun around, armored face as expressionless as ever. He didn’t say anything. His lack of response only served to intensify Nat’s anger. This only further confirms the possibility of him forgetting his promise. <br />
 <br />
“You said you wanted to teach me magic,” Nat stated as she tried to look like she was examining the map. Not once, did she raise her voice.<br />
 <br />
“You promised me.” She added just in case her reminder wasn’t clear enough.<br />
 <br />
“Perhaps… But, you&#39;re going to have to wait a <em>bit</em> longer, Nat. I have priorities.” He hollered back, voice drenched in exasperation. <br />
 <br />
And with that, Isaac disappeared into the woods without further comment. He didn’t even try to look like he cared.<br />
 <br />
Nat simply stared at the general direction her “mentor” disappeared to, her frown deepening by each passing second.<br />
 <br />
He didn&#39;t even notice her obvious irritation...<br />
 <br />
To say that she was frustrated would be an understatement. <br />
 <br />
That’s it!!! He truly had no intentions of teaching her anything.<br />
 <br />
The map in her hands crinkled in outcry as she forcibly shoved it back into her backpack. <br />
 <br />
How could she possibly think she could rely on him! She should have just experimented with her magic just like usual!<br />
 <br />
But instead of doing that, she just sat there, fuming.<br />
 <br />
Why did she even come here?<br />
 <br />
Mary’s prone form drifted into Nat’s worried gaze.<br />
 <br />
That’s right. <br />
 <br />
She’s mainly doing this to protect Mary. For years, she desperately wanted to leave town with her friends, but she never had the courage too. She didn’t want to worry her family. Now… Well… A part of her wanted to make sure her parents were okay. But another part of her also knew that this might be her last chance to travel with Mary and discover what her life outside of town is really like. <br />
 <br />
Nat calmly sat back against the tree.<br />
 <br />
There is another reason why she wanted to tag along.<br />
 <br />
When she first met Isaac, she didn’t trust him. Scratch that, she still thinks he is a pervert! She began to fear for Mary’s safety. Why would she hang around such a freak?! But once she found out that Mary was friends with him, she decided to give him another chance. If he’s friends with Mary, then surely, he’s not that bad. <br />
 <br />
But then she learned a little more about Isaac and found out that he is that childhood friend Nathan kept talking about. Once she made that connection, she began to have mixed thoughts about him. Is he really as great as Nathan said he is? So far, his personality fits the bill. Him protecting her from the bandit hostage situation further confirmed what Nathan has been talking about. But He also failed to mention Isaac’s absentmindedness. And she still has misgiving over Isaac’s intentions to absorb pegasus. Doesn’t that mean killing them? If that’s the case, she’ll have to keep a close eye on him and make sure that doesn’t happen.<br />
 <br />
She once again glanced worriedly at the sleeping Mary. Why would she make herself faint like that? Didn’t she know what would happen? Or was Isaac tricking her into going unconscious? Hope she wakes up soon. As soon as she matures, she’ll be in bigger danger.<br />
 <br />
Nat’s slowly got closer to Mary’s body. It looks like she was getting very close to maturing now.<br />
 <br />
Her figure was becoming increasingly womanly lately. Her breasts were getting rounder and bigger, even if they have not gained nipples yet. And her hips and ass were expanding into a pleasing childbearing shape. Before long, her womanhood would awaken and alert the Sky King to where she was.<br />
 <br />
As her eyes studied Mary&#39;s form, Nat felt a stab of unidentifiable emotion. <br />
 <br />
Anger? She certainly <i>felt</i> frustration with the impediment, but she didn’t think she was actually mad at Mary. Even then, she felt another feeling towards Mary.<br />
 <br />
Envy? Well, there was reason to be envious. Mary was blossoming into womanhood while Nat still had the figure of a girl half her age. And yet Nat had never been in a rush to mature before. <br />
 <br />
Why did she feel like this now? <br />
 <br />
Was the sight of Mary’s changing body causing her to feel like this?<br />
 <br />
Nat shook her head. She didn’t have time to go over her feelings. She had to do something... But what? Keep watch? She&#39;s already doing that... Study her map?... Nah.... She can&#39;t concentrate right now.<br />
 <br />
Despite her greatest efforts, a sigh escaped from her lips.<br />
 <br />
There&#39;s only one thing to do in this kind of situation. <br />
 <br />
“I suppose I could channel my frustration into my magic experiments,” she mused to herself, “That would at least give me something to vent with.” Nat then walked around a tree so she would disturb Mary’s rest and started working on her fire spells. They did seem to flare up more, but she was having a little trouble concentrating with her mixed emotions. She then thought back to her battle with the air dragon... That&#39;s right... She could have tried that.<br />
 <br />
And thus, she began alternating between fire magic, ice magic and water magic. She noticed how well these spells worked together when she fought the air dragon. Maybe she can discover a new relationship between water, fire and ice?<br />
<br />
==========<br />
 <br />
Little did Nat know, Mary’s head wasn’t as empty as it currently seemed. <br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Mary’s body quietly stirred amidst the loud noises of trees evaporating.  Her eyes opened, but they were not Mary’s eyes. Instead, they were all black asides from a pair of purple slits for pupils. The whispered voice that came her mouth was not Mary’s either. <br />
 <br />
“Finally, I thought I’d never be able to use this body.”<br />
 <br />
==========<br />
 <br />
Back during the second fight with Slar...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
 <br />
‘Hello? You still listening to us?’ Rieletta asked.<br />
 <br />
But Isaac’s thoughts were far from Rieletta at the moment.<br />
 <br />
Isaac steeled himself for what he was about to do.<br />
 <br />
Rieletta and Sera were left standing on the Well of Souls watching Isaac’s fight with Slar and his magic Vacuum.<br />
 <br />
‘Looks like he’s distracted.’ Sera surmised.<br />
 <br />
‘Indeed...’ Rieletta said with a smile.<br />
 <br />
Sera was visibly relieved. ‘Hopefully, he’ll just forget about us. The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more likely my teacher will notice us.’<br />
 <br />
Rieletta didn’t stop smiling. ‘Actually… This is perfect.’<br />
 <br />
Sera blinked in confusion.<br />
 <br />
‘How so? We got nothing to do in here. All we can do is talk and watch.’<br />
 <br />
A glint appeared in Rieletta’s eye.<br />
 <br />
‘Now that everyone is distracted, this is the perfect opportunity to use Mary’s bond to the Paladin to jump over to her body.’<br />
 <br />
Sera’s eyes widened with surprise. ‘That…. That’s actually perfect! We have better chances at hiding from Alice if we hide in the girl’s body!’<br />
 <br />
Rieletta licked her lips in excitement. ‘Exactly….’<br />
 <br />
Rieletta proceeds to open up the connection between Mary’s and Isaac’s souls.  To the two souls, the connection appeared in the form of an open gate.<br />
 <br />
Rieletta grabbed Sera’s hand. ‘Let’s go.’<br />
 <br />
But Sera stayed still.<br />
 <br />
Rieletta glanced at Sera with concern. ‘What’s wrong?’<br />
 <br />
‘Shouldn’t we get Landerust and Xadrion?’<br />
 <br />
Rieletta waved her hand in dismissal. ‘Nah. They can eventually find a way out themselves. It’s more important for you to hide from that old hag.’<br />
 <br />
Sera still didn’t budge. <br />
 <br />
Rieletta rolled her eyes. ‘What now?’<br />
 <br />
Sera’s eyes raced with thought. ‘Something just occurred to me. She can detect souls. We can only hope that she didn’t bother checking this halo for souls yet, but she will definitely check the bodies of intruders. She rarely misses any details. Going in Mary’s body will only increase the chances of being seen.’<br />
 <br />
Rieletta put her hands on her hips in a frustrated manner. ‘Then what do you suppose we do? Wait for her to check the halo for souls?’<br />
 <br />
Sera looked Rieletta in the eyes. ‘I will stay here, and you go into Mary’s body. Alice will surely see three souls in Mary’s body. But if it’s just you, she might miss you if you suppress your soul. Try going to sleep or something. That should increase your chances at avoiding detection. And even if she does notice you, she might not care enough to do anything about you. If it was between you or me, she would most definitely go for me. If one of us is gonna escape, it’s better if it is you. I’ll cover for you.’<br />
 <br />
Rieletta shrugged her shoulders.It’s a stupid self-sacrificing plan, but she’s not one to complain. ‘Sounds like a plan. The four of us will get back together someday. See ya later.’ <br />
 <br />
She waved to Sera in gratitude.<br />
 <br />
Sera waved back. ‘Don’t get yourself killed.’<br />
 <br />
‘Right back at you. Try not to let that bitch change you beyond recognition!’ Rieletta shouted back.<br />
 <br />
Without hesitation, Rieletta jumped into the gate.<br />
 <br />
==========<br />
<br />
 Rieletta watched the chaos in the lab unfold through Mary’s eyes.<br />
<br />
Rieletta had never been the patient sort. She hates herself for forcing herself to wait. But she also knows the value of waiting for the right opportunity. Though admittedly… she does pass up good opportunities from time to time.<br />
 <br />
When Landerust and Xadrion had first dibs on Isaac, it took all of Rieletta’s willpower to keep herself from tearing the two males away and taking Isaac for herself. Then she got locked up in the prison that was Isaac&#39;s body, which wasn&#39;t really all that fun. That time, she shouldn’t have waited for the boys to get their turns. She should have stopped the cornered human from fighting back. That was a mistake she rather not repeat.<br />
 <br />
So when Isaac got himself bound to a woman, Rieletta saw her opportunity to escape and took it. Convincing Mary to accept her would have been tricky, but it would have allowed for an easy soul absorption. Jumping ships without Mary&#39;s approval or knowledge meant that Rieletta would have to bide her time until she could find the perfect opportunity to exert her influence over the former cloud woman.<br />
 <br />
This time, Rieletta&#39;s patience was really paying off this time. Mary was so overwhelmed during the chaos caused by Slar&#39;s vacuum attack, she didn&#39;t even notice when the succubus&#39;s soul entered her body. And even better for Rieletta, Mary&#39;s body was now human, which suited her desires rather nicely. Being the impatient, lusty type, the succubus didn&#39;t care a lot for the cloud people. They were too insubstantial, too free-spirited, they didn&#39;t even have their sexual organs until they reached their maturity. It would have been frustrating agony for Rieletta to be dwelling for so long in Mary&#39;s body and not have a pussy to play with. She couldn&#39;t fathom how Nat hadn&#39;t gone mad from not reaching maturity.<br />
 <br />
Thankfully as a human woman, Mary&#39;s flesh no longer hindered Rieletta&#39;s desires. Though it was going to take a while to really exert her power. But she could definitely make a start. Mary was soon going to know what arousal and lust felt like for a woman. And once she&#39;s had a taste, she&#39;d only crave more. And as she fed more on Mary&#39;s pleasure, Rieletta would grow stronger, strong enough to start physically molding Mary&#39;s body to her own design. The potions that Mary was exposed to offered Rieletta a lot of possibilities. She could start working on what Mary absorbed, manifesting the ones that&#39;ll give Mary a sexier body.<br />
 <br />
And yet for sharing Mary&#39;s body, her mind was closed to Rieletta. Well, she could open it, but that would immediately alert Mary to her presence. That could lead to some complications, like having her exorcised. No, she wanted Mary open to her lusty desires and seduction of power. Then, Mary would let the succubus in. <br />
 <br />
Right now, all Rieletta could do was influence Mary&#39;s body slightly.<br />
 <br />
Still, it was better than being in Isaac. Sera should have made the jump while she had the chance. The one downside was that Isaac&#39;s body was not controlled by Isaac himself now. Which was a bit of a shame because Rieletta saw Isaac&#39;s cocks through Mary&#39;s eyes. She definitely wanted a piece of that sexy beast. But Mary&#39;s body would need more changes before she&#39;d be able to handle Isaac. Rieletta was already working on Mary&#39;s pussy, making it needier and more substantial. But most importantly, Rieletta was going to make it last. If Mary turned back into a cloud woman, she was <i>not</i> going to be without a pussy again. <br />
 <br />
Rieletta was going to make sure of that.<br />
 <br />
But first, she’s gonna take Sera’s advice and put herself into a sleep-like state. Doing so will cut her awareness of the outside world. She won&#39;t be completely unaware of course.... Just enough to avoid Alicia’s attention.  <br />
 <br />
She’ll just wait for the right opportunity to make a move…<br />
 <br />
==========<br />
<br />
Present time<br />
<br />
==========<br />
&#8232;<br />
That opportunity is now.<br />
 <br />
Rieletta sat up and stretched. She looked down at her host body and frowned. Mary’s body was no longer human, having returned to cloud person. Pulling up Mary’s shirt confirmed it. While her breasts had grown bigger and rounder, they only a pair of blank orbs. Rieletta rubbed the fronts of them. She felt a very mild pleasure, but nothing substantial, nothing to get her off. “Well, this is annoying,” remarked Rieletta, “I finally have control of the body and I can’t do anything with it yet.” She was going to have to work more on getting Mary’s body fully mature and useful to her.<br />
 <br />
Looking around, Rieletta saw she was in a forest clearing. She didn’t see anyone, but she was pretty sure she wasn’t completely alone. They wouldn’t have left Mary’s body unguarded. And since she couldn’t smell the enticing aroma of lust and corruption, Isaac wasn’t around. That left that other cloud girl. What was her name? Ah, yes, Nat. Strange name for a girl.<br />
 <br />
Rieletta soon picked up where Nat was. There was a rather tantalizing set of emotions behind one tree. Rieletta stalked towards the location, peering around the tree. <br />
 <br />
Much to her amusement, the little cloud girl was practicing magic, aura ripe with frustration. There was also a good portion of green envy in it as well. But there was an undercurrent beneath the emotions on the surface. It was something Rieletta knew well, but seemed out of place here. What would prompt sexual attraction from a girl like Nat?<br />
 <br />
On the whole, Nat was quite an enigma for Rieletta. She was as old as Mary and yet her body hadn’t progressed past the start of puberty. And if Rieletta was recalling her gleaming of Mary’s memories right, Nat has shown very little interest in boys. <br />
 <br />
For a succubus, that was very puzzling, yet undeniably intriguing.<br />
 <br />
<i>”Such a strange girl. If only I could see inside her head.”</i> Rieletta paused a moment as she realized something. <i>”Wait a minute, I’m a succubus. This is something we specialize in. Huh, I haven’t done this in years. Of course, she’ll need to be asleep first.”</i><br />
 <br />
Rieletta&#39;s plans of waiting for Nat to sleep after exerting enough energy quickly went sour. The cloud girl seemed determined to practice while had stopped on their journey. And with all things that required waiting, Rieletta soon found her patience wearing thin.<br />
 <br />
Fortunately, there was an easy way to speed this up. She took a deep breath before blowing in Nat’s direction, her succubus breath being sweet and soothing. <br />
 <br />
Nat paused as the perfume-like scent reached her proximity, the cloud girl suddenly yawning. For some reason, that smell was making her feel sleepy. But she shouldn’t sleep, not when Mary…<br />
 <br />
The thought trailed off as Nat nodded off. She teetered backwards on her feet. Rietta rushed forwards and caught her before she fell, gently laying Nat down against the ground. After that, she crouched down on top of her. <br />
 <br />
This was the traditional power of succubi; to sit upon mortals and enter their dreams, which allowed them to feed off of their sexual energy. Though normally, Rieletta would have the man’s dick between her legs so she could get off him more directly. She had done it with women in the past, but usually there was at least something for her to bump her breasts into instead of the blank slab that Rieletta had currently leaned into. <br />
 <br />
“Now, let’s see what will turn you on,” Rieletta crooned in Nat’s ear before she started projecting herself into Nat’s dreams...</p>
