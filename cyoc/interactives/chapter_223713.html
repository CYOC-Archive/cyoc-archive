<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;W-what!? No. No way! I can&#39;t do that!&quot; You stammer out in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I want to try. I have a hunch even if I don&#39;t have a body painted in here for me, I&#39;ll be okay. Go ahead and erase me, then you can paint the canvas into any scene you want it to be.&quot; Dave replies smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what will happen to you?! If you get erased won&#39;t you cease to be!?&quot; You protest scared for Dave&#39;s well being.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, I don&#39;t think this canvas will let me die as long as I&#39;m in here. I think it will turn me into whatever is painted on here if I am erased. So go ahead and try it, then... paint into the canvas anything you want me to be.&quot; Dave says reassuringly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what, like a dog or another person?&quot; You ask not so sure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything really... Could be a landscape painting or a forest scene or something like that. I want know what will happen if you repaint me as a scene instead of a portrait. I promise, I&#39;ll be okay.&quot; Dave replies.<br />
<br />
You take a breath and realize what Dave is trying to say. &quot;Okay, I get it... You want to see if you get erased, if you&#39;ll possess something other than a living thing if the canvas is painted that way and your still trapped inside...&quot; You say. &quot;Exactly. If this works, Erin, this means we can turn ourselves into anything we want to experience and be as a painting. The possibilities are endless!&quot; Dave replies. &quot;Dave, if this works out, I&#39;m coming in there with you, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever want to leave.&quot; You say, feeling a bit excited by the possibilities. &quot;Then let&#39;s hope this works then. I&#39;m ready to get started whenever your ready. Go ahead, erase me.&quot; Dave says before he spreads himself out smiling.<br />
<br />
You then nod your head and let go of the painting. You then take up the paint brush and give it one last thought before continuing, after all, you are about to try to erase your best friend but then again, when you were inside there you felt like you were just a painting. Maybe he will be alright in the end and your just worrying about nothing. Now made up your mind, you but the brush up to the picture of Dave on the canvas, and start wiping it away.<br />
<br />
Dave feels the brush make contact with his image and freezes in place, unable to move as his image is slowly wiped away, brushstroke by brushstroke. Every time more of him is erased, he feels like he naturally never had those features to begin with and a pulse of ecstasy radiates through what remains of the rest of his 2D body. After you have erased his entire left arm, his right hand, and started to erase one his legs, Dave feels something else radiating besides his body, at first he can&#39;t put his finger on it, but he feels like he&#39;s expanding, rather than shrinking... With you now having erased his right leg, the feeling of radiating sexual energy is even stronger and Dave gets more of a grasp to what he&#39;s feeling... You begin to erase his left leg and his right arm and Dave&#39;s excitement pushes even higher as he feels the pulses of sexual ecstasy from every brush stroke radiate through him and into the canvas itself. With both of Dave&#39;s arms and legs no longer painted into existence. You pause for a moment and put your hand to the painting to speak with Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, you doing okay in there?&quot; You ask concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! I&#39;m doing great! I feel strange though, but this feels completely different...&quot; Dave replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;How so, is it like when I erased your hand?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, its like... I don&#39;t know... it&#39;s kind of like I feel embedded into this canvas really... I almost kind of feel like, I&#39;m still here and all, but... the more of me you erase the more I feel like this blank canvas is becoming me... or I&#39;m becoming it... It&#39;s making me stupidly horny too...&quot; the still image of Dave&#39;s head and torso states.<br />
<br />
You seem more concerned but Dave seems to be okay. &quot;So if I touch the canvas somewhere else, can you tell me if you can feel it?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, yeah good idea. Let&#39;s try that...&quot; Dave replies. You then take your other hand and touch somewhere on the canvas no image is drawn. &quot;Do you feel that?&quot; You ask. &quot;No. I don&#39;t feel anything... but... I get the sense that something is happening to me somewhere I can&#39;t feel or see... Your touching the top right corner right?&quot; Dave replies. You nod. &quot;Okay, so I can sense something... Huh... Erin... keep erasing me... please. Don&#39;t stop this time either, just keep going until I disappear completely... Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ll be okay...&quot; Dave states plainly. You nod and let go of the painting, and then get back to work erasing the painting.<br />
<br />
You decide to start with Dave&#39;s hair and face next, erasing it from the canvas. Dave&#39;s vision continues to view the entire scene he&#39;s in in 3rd person, even though he no longer has any eyes. His mind however feels like it is stuck inside the scene now completely. He&#39;s still mentally there but quickly realizing forming thoughts is getting harder and harder, defaulting to just what his painted senses are sensing. Just a torso painted onto a canvas now, Dave&#39;s sexual euphoria skyrockets as he practically has an orgasm now with every new brush stroke you make to his image, erasing his chest bit by bit. Now nothing more than a painted waist, Dave&#39;s essence and mentality is going crazy with ecstasy as he feels you slowly erase his mid section, leaving nothing but his crotch left in the painting, showing a sporting bulge... Dave feels like he&#39;s about to explode from the overwhelming sexual energy pulsing through what remains of his painted body, but as the final strokes come in to erase the painting of his crotch, relaxation and orgasm finally come to Dave as his crotch is finally erased.<br />
<br />
You then step back and look at the now completely blank canvas. There is no trace left of Dave, or that he was ever even sucked into the canvas and turned into a painting. You put your hand up to the canvas&#39;s edge and feel no resistance. If you push your hand against it any harder, it feels like it will sink in. Is Dave really gone? The magic canvas is acting like it&#39;s completely empty... You could go right in now if you wanted to and there would be no one to tell you no, but you are worried about Dave now that he&#39;s been completely erased from the scene. You can&#39;t hear him speak anymore no matter how many times you call his name while touching the canvas.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Dave can hear your faded echo&#39;s in the blank canvas as you repeatedly call his name. Dave himself feels completely formless, his mind is still there, he is still himself, but he feels like he is well... a blank canvas... literally... He&#39;s completely blissful inside the blankness of the canvas too... Dave takes a moment to think about what he&#39;s feeling. Is this what existence is like before someone is born? I feel like a blank canvas... No... I am a blank canvas... I feel like I have infinite potential... I could become anything... Anything someone paints me to be... Anything put onto the canvas would be me... Dave&#39;s mind then realizes that if you were to get sucked into the painting right now, there&#39;s a very real possibility he would become you! How would that even work? Would you be you and he would also be you? Would Dave forget he&#39;s Dave and become you or would he be still himself but in your body? But if you paint him as something on the canvas and then you step inside, would he be the thing you painted, or would he be you, or would he be both? Dave&#39;s mind rattled on and on about the possibilities and the implications of being a blank canvas and what exactly that means. Well, there&#39;s no way for him to contact you in this state... All Dave can do is wait for you to make your next move and decide what he will be painted as and be...</p>
