<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hillary waltzed home, feeling like she was on cloud nine. She couldn’t believe she’d done that, not simply the seemingly magical act but the audacity of the whole thing. She was oddly proud of herself.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Walking in, she realized she hadn’t seen Andrew for quite a while. She looked and saw that his light was on; she didn’t want him spoiling her night tonight, that little—-<br />
<br />
“Wait a second. That’s not true. It would be horrible for him to walk in, but for him, not me.” She thought to herself, taking a deep breath. These past few weeks had really put their relationship into perspective, and she felt guilty for how she’d acted.<br />
<br />
So while she’d normally barge in and kick him out, she decided to knock gently.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Andrew was on his laptop, looking over the Chronivac. The changes were far more  intense than he’d thought, and it had added a new person to the list. He wondered who Dakota Simmons was. That name sounds familiar, he thought. Clicking on her profile, he looked at her information. “20 years old, works out, goes to…” Andrew’s face lost some of its color. He recognized Dakota because they went to the same campus. They’d had classes together. This was so strange.<br />
<br />
While he didn’t necessarily regret it, he was a little shocked at just how much it had changed things. He even noticed his house morphing and warping day by day.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he heard a knock on his door. <br />
<br />
“Um… just a second!” He said.<br />
<br />
“Sure, sweetie. Take your time, I just need to talk to you about something. I’ll be in the living room.”<br />
<br />
“Sweetie?” “Take your time?” Knocking on the door? That didn’t sound like his mom at all. Even her voice was different, and Andrew noted with disgust, more seductive. He locked his laptop, leaving the Chronivac running (something he’d done for a few days because he was terrified of locking it) and walked out to the living room.<br />
<br />
Andrew’s jaw dropped a bit when he saw his mother in the living room, sitting in her pink tracksuit. He’d adjusted reality to make his mother oblivious to the fact that he’d be shocked, and he’d seen a model of the new her on the computer, but he couldn’t believe the big breasted MILF sitting right in front of him. He felt a slight stirring in his penis-<br />
<br />
“No! That’s your mom!” He thought to himself, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
“Hey mom.” He said, trying to act casual.<br />
<br />
Hillary looked at him. “Oh, hey sweetie!”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Hillary was sitting on the couch, waiting for her son. She’d tried to do the same thing to him that she’d done to Dakota, to “convince” him to leave, but it hadn’t worked at all - she couldn’t even hear his thoughts. “Maybe it doesn’t work on guys. Oh well, it’ll work out.” She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
“Hey mom.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
Hillary was a bit surprised. Even her own son didn’t recognize her changes. He was so casual about it. “I guess if no one else could tell, it makes sense he wouldn’t.” She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
“Hey sweetie.” She said aloud. “Listen, do you think… well.” She reached into her purse, and found far more money than she would’ve had a couple days ago. Her eyes about to pop out of her head, she quickly claimed herself down and pulled out a fifty.<br />
<br />
“Listen, I could bullshit you and say I want you to go find a girlfriend or something, but that doesn’t seem fair. Do you think you could go out tonight so I could have the house? And if you need a hotel…” she put the money back and grabbed a credit card she didn’t remember having. Somehow, though, she knew she didn’t have to worry about the limit or her financials. “Here. Take this, and if you don’t mind, give me the house until tomorrow. I’ve… I’ve got a date coming over.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Sure mom! Thanks for being honest and not just kicking me out.” Andrew said. He took the card and went back to his room.<br />
<br />
“Oh thank god. That went way more smoothly than it should’ve.” Hillary said to herself when she noticed Andrew had left.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Okay, so she’s definitely… nicer. And I don’t think she noticed anything. Maybe this wasn’t an… ethical thing to do. I’ll take my computer with me and try to work things out.” Andrew thought to himself. She’d changed a lot more than he’d expected, and apparently was only around halfway finished.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his backpack, a change of clothes (clothes that were much nicer than his old ones, he noted,) and his laptop, carefully looking over the program before realizing he could leave it running while it was in sleep mode. He closed his laptop, grabbed that and his charger, and put them in his backpack before leaving the house and walking to the local entertainment district. He and Hillary lived in a smaller city, but a city nonetheless, which helped a lot because Andrew couldn’t afford a car and Hillary hated driving.<br />
<br />
After about 20 minutes, he reached his destination, a medium grade hotel. “Hi, can I get a room please?” He said, awkwardly, to the concierge before sliding over his mom’s credit card.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing, sir! We have one available with a king sized bed. I’ll set you right up.” She said back.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, and Andrew had plugged his laptop charger into an outlet at the included desk.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Hillary had been given another “thought” that would help her with Dakota. She’d changed out of her pink workout suit, taken a quick shower, avoiding once again putting the shower head directly on her wet pussy, and out some lingerie she found in her wardrobe - a see through black bra and panties set, a garter belt, and stockings. And to her surprise - she actually liked how her body looked for once. Really liked it.<br />
<br />
She turned down the lights and lit some candles. Part of her was tempted to put some porn on, but she thought that might be too much. Suddenly, she heard the doorbell ring.<br />
<br />
Standing outside was Dakota, wearing a pair of yoga pants, a crop top that was just a bit too big, a pair of sneakers and holding a shopping bag from the store she’d met Hillary in. Hillary opened the door.<br />
<br />
“Come on in!” She said happily.<br />
<br />
Dakota looked a bit shell shocked.<br />
<br />
“Um… uh, sure.” She said, looking around.<br />
<br />
Hillary tried to manipulate Dakota’s thoughts again, but found it much harder this time.<br />
<br />
“Damn, must’ve moved too quickly. Oh well, it’ll all work out.” She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
Dakota closed the door behind her.<br />
<br />
“Um… Hillary, why are you dressed like that?” She asked, cautiously.<br />
<br />
An opening; the fact that she hadn’t just left was a good sign. Hillary responded: “Well, how am I supposed to model for you and teach you how to dress with my clothes on?”<br />
<br />
Dakota looked unsure.<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t sound right… maybe I should leave?” Hillary heard her think.<br />
<br />
Hillary focused as hard as she could. It felt as if the letters were made of metal and she had to bend them by hand. Quickly, though, she was able to make it more favorable towards herself.<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t sound right… but Hillary wouldn’t lie.” Dakota was thinking instead.<br />
<br />
As Dakota came in to the house, she set her bags down.<br />
<br />
“So… um… why the candles?” Dakota asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, you wanted to know how to style the clothes, right? You’re gonna wanna look good everywhere! On the street, in the club, in the bedroom…” Hillary said with a wink.<br />
<br />
Dakota got a bit nervous again.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m not sure… something seems off.” She thought to herself. <br />
<br />
This uncertainty, though, worked in Hillary’s favor. She focused again. This time, the words and letters moved like soft clay, and Hillary was able to craft a new sentence easily.<br />
<br />
“Hillary’s so right! If I don’t look good in this lighting, none of it will matter.” Dakota thought.<br />
<br />
Dakota smiled and said “You’re right. I shouldn’t doubt you so much, Hillary. I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“That’s okay, Dakota! I know it can be scary. Let’s start with something easy. I’m going to show you some outfits and then we can look at what you’ve brought, okay?” Hillary said.<br />
<br />
Dakota nodded and sat on the couch.<br />
<br />
Hillary started with a skirt and tube top. Once she came out, she posed a bit, focusing on Dakota’s thoughts a bit.<br />
<br />
“Wow, she looks good in that. It really accentuates her figure.” Dakota thought. There was no sexual desire in that thought at all. Hillary decided to tweak that.<br />
<br />
Again, the thoughts were a bit harder to move around, but the more Hillary did it, the easier it was getting.<br />
<br />
“Wow, her butt looks great in that skirt! I wish mine looked that good. And her boobs are… really nice. I don’t like girls, do I?” Dakota’s new thought read.<br />
<br />
Shaking her head a bit, she tried to focus on the impromptu fashion show.<br />
<br />
Hillary kept going, changing outfits and slowly but surely showing more skin. She had been making Dakota’s thoughts had slowly more perverted, until she was confident that Dakota wanted to sleep with her.<br />
<br />
After about the tenth outfit, Hillary walked out just in her lingerie. She felt Dakota’s gaze on her and decided to read her mind again.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god… I can’t believe I’m thinking this, but her tits are fucking huge. And her ass! I want her so bad. But… it’s wrong, isn’t it?” Dakota’s thoughts were a bit scrambled, but Hillary could fix that. <br />
<br />
“Her tits are so big! I wish I had big, sexy tits like that! And her ass! I thought mine was good, but Hillary’s… mmm, I just wanna grab it and shove my face between her cheeks! I can’t believe I’m thinking this, but she’s so sexy!” Dakota was panting now, her face red.<br />
<br />
“Dakota…” Hillary started, almost cooing it.<br />
<br />
She jumped a bit. Hillary swooped in and out her arm around Dakota’s shoulder. She put her face right next to Dakota’s ear and started whispering.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, sweetie. I’ve seen the way you’ve been looking at my body, even at the clothing store when I went up to you. The truth is, I’ve wanted you. And I know you want me too. So let’s stop pretending and get this going.” Hillary finished the whispering with a soft kiss on Dakota’s ear before starting to kiss her neck. Dakota didn’t resist at all, instead moving her hands up and down Hillary’s back.<br />
<br />
Hillary pulled Dakota’s top off and unhooked her bra. Dakota moaned as Hillary pulled her bra away. Hillary started kissing lower and lower on Dakota’s neck before eventually reaching her mosquito bite breasts. She sensually licked her nipples, biting one gently as her other hand had gone into Dakota’s pants, rubbing her finger over Dakota’s pussy through her panties. Dakota moaned louder and louder, becoming more aroused and easier to bend to Hillary’s will.<br />
<br />
Hillary kissed Dakota, and Dakota happily reciprocated. Dakota had never been this turned on in her life, and honestly, Hillary hadn’t either.<br />
<br />
The two of them made out for a while longer, Hillary eventually getting her lingerie off and Dakota pulling her own pants and underwear down.<br />
<br />
Hillary got on top and started scissoring, hearing Dakota moan, if not shout, as she adjusted their position. Finally, the two climaxed, both sharing the strongest orgasms of their lives thus far.<br />
<br />
Hillary, for the first time since her first transformation, felt… satisfied. No longer a slave to her lust filled thoughts… and yet, no regret, no bad after feeling. In fact, she wanted to keep embracing those thoughts.<br />
<br />
As both girls panted and tried to recover, Hillary felt her already large breasts begin to grow again, savoring the warmth she was once afraid of. The natural breast fat grew yet another cup size, and her implants really pushed the limit this time - growing three more sizes, making her obvious fake tits even more obvious. She knew she’d turn heads when she was walking now, she was so close to being just like that hot slut she’d seen when she first saw Dakota. Her hair finally became a pure blonde, and while it wasn’t quite platinum, she’d never be mistaken for a brunette again. Her hips widened - she could feel the bones shift a bit. She felt her ass implants grow again as her natural butt grew from exercising. She was getting fitter - she now had abs on her taut stomach, and her arms and legs were slightly more toned, though not extremely so.<br />
<br />
All of Hillary’s body hair was gone, now, except for a small, perfectly cut patch of public hair near her vagina.<br />
<br />
Her face changed next. Her lips that could’ve almost been mistaken for natural on a good day were now so thick everyone would know she’d gotten lip fillers. Her lipgloss was a nice sparkling pink. The rest of her makeup became even heavier, looking more professional than before.<br />
<br />
Hillary felt like she’d broken through to something. No longer just “attractive.” She felt as though she’d gone above average. Bigger than normal tits. Fatter than normal ass. Tighter than normal waist. Sluttier than normal makeup. She was improving, and she needed to keep going. <br />
<br />
Hillary looked down at Dakota, who was panting and still recovering. The mosquito bite tits were gone, replaced with B cups. Hillary knew, though, that Dakota’s tit growth was completely fake, no natural growth at all, and that turned her on.<br />
<br />
Dakota’s already nice ass looked only slightly bigger, but rounded and more firm that it had been. Dakota’s hair seemed longer too, and fuller. <br />
<br />
Hillary knew that this was only the beginning. Soon, Dakota would match her own assets. She’d created another one, another one just like her - only this one wasn’t aware of her changes.<br />
<br />
Hillary manipulated Dakota’s thoughts once again. She knew that Dakota had potential, she just had to unlock it.<br />
<br />
“I wish I could feel like this forever.” Dakota was thinking.<br />
<br />
Hillary changed it to “I’m so horny I need to get home and masturbate to lesbian porn right now!”<br />
<br />
Hillary noted Dakota jumping a bit.<br />
<br />
“Sweetie, are you alright?” Hillary said, playing dumb.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! I mean, um. Yes! That was wonderful. I need to get going, though. Can I call you?” Dakota said.<br />
<br />
“Of course, sweetie. I’ll see you soon.” Hillary said, blowing a kiss.<br />
<br />
Dakota smiled back and quickly dressed, her bra and panties having adjusted for her new assets. Her crop top looked a lot more fitting now, her yoga pants further accentuating her nice ass.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll call you! Thanks for everything, Hillary.” She said, leaving the house.<br />
<br />
“That went perfectly.” Hillary said, licking her lips. She wondered how long this cooldown period would last - not that she cared, anymore. She was much more confident in her lust filled thoughts, and the thought of returning to her old life now sounded unappealing instead of warm and comforting.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Dakota couldn’t believe how turned on she was. She was shocked, but grateful, that Hillary knew how much she’d wanted her, and even more grateful that Hillary felt the same way.<br />
<br />
“What a MILF…” she thought, as she boarded the bus. She needed to get home and masturbate. She’d never been with a woman before but she’d always been curious, and now she knew that it was incredible. Finally, her stop arrived. She just about ran up to her apartment, slamming the door behind her.<br />
<br />
She pulled up some lesbian porn - something she’d been watching for a while, not quite sure how she felt about it. She realized now she’d been in denial. This one was a good one, too. Slutty stepmother fucks clueless stepdaughter. She pulled out a dildo and started masturbating, imagining the stepmother as Hillary and herself as the stepdaughter.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Dakota came, hard and quick, Hillary filling her mind again. As Dakota recovered from her orgasm, she didn’t notice her tits growing another cup size, subtle makeup appearing on her face, her lips getting just a bit fuller. Her rear expanded a bit, too, staying all natural but looking even better than before. Her body hair lightened, just like Hillary’s, and the hair on her head became less plain and straight looking, getting wavier and longer. <br />
<br />
What Dakota did notice, however, was that she was finally satisfied. She couldn’t believe it took such a strong orgasm from a MILF and masturbating to do it, but she finally felt okay. She got up, pulling her pants back up as she did, and walked into the bathroom to wash her face.<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, she found something odd. “My boobs are still fake. Not like I was growing anything before!” She said with a laugh. She definitely didn’t find it odd that her makeup hadn’t come off, either. Or that her hair was now shoulder length instead of cropped. No, nothing felt odd to her other than an overall feeling of being out of place.<br />
<br />
“Must be that after sex glow.” She said, shrugging it off, going into her living room, and turning the TV off.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Hillary realized something; she’d felt when Dakota changed the first time, and now, miles away, she knew Dakota had changed again.<br />
<br />
“Oh my. Seems the thought change worked.” She noticed something else. If she focused really really hard, she could just about see Dakota’s thoughts. These, though, felt like they were made of concrete and titanium, welded together with bedrock. She couldn’t change them at all. She knew, though, that she and Dakota were linked now, and the more Dakota changed, the easier it would be to manipulate her thoughts at a distance.<br />
<br />
Hillary sighed, proud of her work today, and kicked back on the couch, ready to rest.</p>
