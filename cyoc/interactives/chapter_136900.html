The tingling feeling shifted to his butt.<br />
<br />
then, the tingling feeling became a sharp pain. that pain got stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger.<br />
<br />
then a sharp long worm grew from his butt.<br />
<br />
When the changes finally stopped, he saw that he now had got a huge long rat tail!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Stan exclaimed. &quot;the tf site works! I have a tail!&quot; <br />
<br />
He sat down, wondering what would be next for his chimera tf. would it be wings, feet, or something else entirely?<br />

<br />
Stan wriggled the toes of his new lion feet.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt quite... hot.<br />
Hot, and itchy.<br />
<br />
What gives? he wondered, scratching the back of his neck and discovering that he was in need of a haircut, but then he felt something scratch it. He lowered his hand and saw that his fingernails were now much longer, and all ended in sharp points.<br />
That ain&#39;t right. Maybe I&#39;m hallucinating, Stan erroneously surmised, but as he went to absentmindedly bite a nail, he discovered that it wasn&#39;t just his fingernails that were growing. Some of his teeth were now much longer and sharper too.<br />
<br />
He laughed, wriggling his toes.<br />
<br />
Stan liked his new self.<br />
He noticed his hair looked more frizzier and bigger, and he even noticed he&#39;d gained a beard. Not the small stubble he&#39;d had when he was 18, but like a bushy beard that went around his head. <br />
<br />
it was like he was part man, part lion. &quot;Wow!&quot; he said. then, he coughed, his voice beginning to catch in his throat, a little raspy, as if he was getting a cold or something.<br />
<br />
he was the first human/lion hybrid in the world.<br />

<br />
Stan pulled on his tail. it hurt when he pulled it.<br />
<br />
then, he felt a different pain, this time from his lion clawed human hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; he said. &quot;What is this?&quot; <br />
<br />
He watched incredulously as his bare hands swelled up, like a balloon. then, there was a sudden pop! and webbing grew in between his fingers; also, his hands increased in length.<br />
<br />
on his hands, his fingers had webbing in between. <br />
and his lion claws were nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
Stan felt his hands, and he giggled. &quot;This is amazing! What next for my chimera tf?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
what came next?<br />
<br />
was it wings? was it an extra head. was it something else.<br />

<br />
Stan Simply stood there like an idiot, waiting for his next transformation. He probably should be scared of being turned into some kind of mismatched creature. After all, Stan read enough about shady sites like this to know this tf is probably irreversible. Thats how it works on the tf story he read on the internet anyways. But he doesn&#39;t really care. Since he was a kid, he dreamed of becoming a shapeshifter. For some reason, he always been curious of what a different animal body felt compared to an human body. He even went as far as drawing different chimera combinations in his journal since childhood. When he was alone he pretended to have a wolf&#39;s paw and try to figure out what it feels to have one, or something like that. Point being, Stan always wanted to shape shift at will and experience different body parts and have the changes be reversible. And since this is the first real experience he had all his life, Stan won&#39;t live it down. Even so, Stan would have preferred to have the option to reverse his transformations at will and try an different combinations but just incase this tf is irreversible, he&#39;ll be satisfied to try out different animal past as a chimera. At least he get to feel what it be like to transform. With that said, Stan wished he could chose what parts he want. Oh well, hopely this app won&#39;t give him unoriginal tf&#39;s like a horse cock or bull&#39;s testicles. He saw that sinario enough times on CYOC to be tired of it. Stan hope the pain was worth it. Maybe he&#39;ll get something like plant roots for feet. Of course, weed feet aren&#39;t really animal feet. Or are they?<br />
<br />
On that note, Stan&#39;s thoughts were interrupted when he found it too painful to stand on his lion paws. It doesn&#39;t look like paws were made to carry a whole person for a long period of time. Instinctively, Stan fell PAINFULY on his worm of a tail and got a good view of his still changing hands. Stan painfully felt his hands slowly grow thicker. Through his cringed his eyes he could see his hands grow more rounder and... yellower? That&#39;s when Stan realized just what his hands are changing into. His theory was confirmed after about an half an hour later as his hands thicken. As a finishing touch, his new duck feet bent at a 90% angle forcing him to hold them in a forward position like a actual duck. He can&#39;t straighten them out anymore. It&#39;s like his wrists disappeared. Well, not exactly. His &#39;hands&#39; now moves slightly up and down like actual feet. When the changes finally ended, it took a few moments for the pain to subside. <br />
<br />
Soon afterwards, Stan awkwardly stood up to examined his fully changed hands. Yep, those are definitely duck feet. Either way, he was ecstatic over these new sensations. The first obvious thing is how sensitive his sense of touch became to the air around him. That sticks him as odd since they are big, thick, flat feet. But what really surprised him was how he can really feel the lukewarm temperature with his slick feet. He guess duck feet is just more sensitive to the air/temperature... huh? Stan was not sure this is what duck feet really feel like or this is just something the weird app cooked up, but if the transformation of his rat tail, duck feet and previous changes was this dramatic then it&#39;s probably a good idea to be prepared for the the next TF.<br />
<br />
Now that he has feet for hands, Stand decided to go on all fours. see what it is like. So he bent down and went on all fours. Upon touching the ground, Stan was startled by how COLD the floor was to his new duck feet. Another thing he noticed was how awkward it was to BE in all fours. He may have lion paws now but that only applies to his feet. His knees aches with how LONG his legs were. It doesn&#39;t help that his back wasn&#39;t designed to be in a downward position for a long period of time. Even his hips are starting to act right now. It was a little awkward, he is not used to the traction of duck feet or the balance of his constantly flailing rat tail. His sense of balance is just OFF.  He wasn&#39;t should it was just his rat tail or if it was how his body was structured right now. His hands and feet may be animal feet now but it&#39;s obvious that his body is still not built to be on all fours. Give it a few more transformations and then he&#39;ll try it again. With that decided, Stan stood back up again.<br />
<br />
Speaking of transformations, Stan still has his clothes on. Stan looked down at his new duck feet and the lack of wrists. His flat hands already makes handling things diced. Man, it&#39;s going to be a pain He just realized this if he keeps transforming like this, his cloths will be ripped to shreds. He read plenty of stories were the transformed person doesn&#39;t care about his or her cloths because they won&#39;t be needing them for the rest of their lives. After all, animal don&#39;t need the unnecessary baggage. Well, this is the real world (hopefully) and Stan thinks it&#39;s a real waste for his personal cloths to be ruined forever. Especially if these changes are reversible. He was just luck that his rat tail managed to grow above his jeans and underwear instead of ripping through them. The first piece of clothing he tried to remove wis his shirt. Now that his hands are big and lacking the proper wrists to monomer them, needless to say, the shirt was the most difficult to remove. Luckily, it was down hill from there. It was a little hard to unbutton his pants but the rest was easy. Pulling down his pants and underpants was the easy part. His shoes was already removed thanks to his Feline paws. Once he was fully nude, he trotted over to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Luckily, the bathroom was spacious enough to watch his reflection even when he is transforming. His bathroom mirror covers the whole wall so he can get a full body view of himself.<br />
<br />
 With nothing else to do but wait, Stan stared at his reflection and fantasied good chimera parts he might have. After all, his transformation is random, and he might as well be hopeful and optimistic.<br />
<br />
He wondered what it would be like to have the hearing of bat ears, the weird eyesight chameleon eyes, the HUGE raccoon dog testicles, a maneuverability of a elephant trunk, the even more weird eyesight of housefly eyes, the giganticness whale cock, the speed of chetah legs, the amount of spider legs, The odd movements of crock-crouch legs, the interesting position of chicken legs, vice versa. Stan would have appreciated if he became a chimera with the best and weirdest animal parts in the world. That&#39;s what he wants, to have the fastest running legs, the best ears any any animal could have, and to just have the weirdest face. among other things.<br />
<br />
Just then, Stan felt a sharp pain come from somewhere on his body, and from the intensity of it, he knew it was going to be a BIG TF. &#39;Please let it be a Crocadile Jaw or maybe an Alligator muzzle.&#39; Stan thought exitely. <br />
<br />
<br />
Then IT happened.<br />

Stan felt the pain on his face; for this was coming next:<br />
<br />
CROCODILE JAWS!!!<br />
<br />
Stan felt his jaws & mouth grow longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer and longer, till they were as long as the average crocodile&#39;s jaws.<br />
<br />
Then it gained scales, covering the whole jaw. Then he gained over 9000 teeth in it.<br />
<br />
Stan opened his new jaw. it opened at a 90 degree angle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coool!&quot; Stan said excitedly. &quot;I&#39;m gonna look sssssssssssssso cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
the snake hiss was somewhat of a side effect, but all the same, Stan was impressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else is to come for my tf?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
With nothing else to do but wait, Stan stared up at his roof to think up of good chimera parts he might have. After all, his transformation is random, and he might as well be optimistic.<br />
<br />
Then... this happened:<br />

<br />
The POV shifted to the person in charge of Stan&#39;s Transformations. Alright, let&#39;s rewind a bit. When loading the TFme website, instead of clicking on it&#39;s &#39;Transform Me&#39; option which is what Stan did, you&#39; can click on the &#39;sign in&#39; button to look at all the unoccupied profiles, ready to be changed. All the available profiles are of everyone who click the &#39;Transform Me&quot; option. When you&#39;re on someone&#39;s profile, it will show a full scale view of the person&#39;s body with a list of body parts and statistic that can be modified. Of corse, how much the user can edit depends on what kind of transformations the person chooses. The rarest chosen category is the chimera category.  <br />
<br />
The more you transform people, the more points you gain and the more transformation options you unlock. For example, for the chimera category, you can unlock the ability to add non animal parts. This includes, but not limited to, inanimate body parts, like having a cook book for a muzzle or having fictional features like vampire fangs or medusa eyes or dragon wings. With enough points, you can even unlock the ability to read the subject&#39;s mind. That brings us to the person currently in charge of Stan&#39;s Transformation, Tracy Sanders. <br />
<br />
Tracy was fortunate enough to stumble upon TFme when she was twelve years old, and ever since then, she been transforming people as much as she could on her free time. Just like Stan, she had a thing for chimeras, and has always been jumping at the opportunity to create new chimeras as well as gaining points for more transformation options. Ironicly enough, Tracy never clicked on the &#39;Transform Me&#39; herself. Maybe a part of her is too shy to let someone else transform her. Or maybe she still wants to believe that this site doesn&#39;t actually transform people in real life. After all, it&#39;s a big world out there and she has yet to see a real chimera with her own eyes. But then again, she doesn&#39;t get out much.For all she knows, there may be a real chimera next door. Either way, she got really inspired from reading Stan&#39;s thoughts on the computer screen. Just think, someone else who wondered what it was to be like to be a chimera. It really encourages her to be creative with Stan&#39;s transformations. If this site is right, then she will give Stan the most interesting experience he could possibly dream of!... After she goes to the bathroom that is. With that thought, Tracy ran toward the household bathroom. Ironically, Stan and Tracy are next door neighbors and they never met. Which is amazing saying you can practically step out and see all the buildings in the growing town known as Harmony. Meanwhile..... Stan was brimming with imagination whiling patiently waiting for his next transformation.  Tracy came back from the bathroom and read Stan&#39;s plight. Even though these two are in different houses, Tracy Willy Anderson understood what Stan was feeling and quickly made some modifications. The kiddie gloves are off, now it&#39;s time to get creative. Now it&#39;s PERSONAL!<br />

<br />
Stan waited for the next bit of his chimera tf.<br />
<br />
After all, his transformation is random, and he might as well be optimistic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he got struck with a pain in his back.<br />
<br />
Within seconds he saw 2 huge green scaly dragon wings a-growin from his back. the wings were as long as his arms.<br />
<br />
Stan flapped his new wings, then he slowly began to fly.<br />
<br />
Stan flew around his house excitedly. He had never felt happier in his life. <br />
<br />
He should have been horrified at what he&#39;d become, but he somewhat liked his new form.<br />
<br />
He wondered what else was to come for his transformation.<br />
<br />
and this came next:<br />

<br />
Everything else is human<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Stan felt a jabbing pain in his upper back, and he involuntarily hunched over a little bit. His back felt heavier as a growing mass worked its way out between his shoulder blades. At first, he thought it might be a dorsal fin, but it was much too wide. Then he thought it was a camel&#39;s hump, but started feeling very muscular, so that he could move it back and forth, just like his tail. The hump stretched out and became longer until it was a pole-like appendage several feet long. He moved the bulge to the right and, looking over at it, he noticed it was furry with big dark brown splotches.<br />
<br />
Instead of tapering to a point, the far end of the growth started to widen into what was clearly recognizable as a muzzle. It started to dawn on him that his &quot;hump&quot; was actually a very long furry neck. New nostrils opened, and he was suddenly assaulted by a range of new smells coming from behind him! Then he noticed the mouth and focused his concentration on it. He watched, wide-eyed as the jaw dropped open and a long purple tongue flopped out. It was a bizarre feeling--he could feel his human tongue in his human mouth, but he also felt his animal tongue sticking out of this new mouth. After some more careful concentration, he managed to lift the tongue back into his muzzle, which he then carefully closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird...&quot; said his human mouth.<br />
<br />
Horns covered in soft fuzz sprouted from above the muzzle, and so did to long triangular ears. His hearing suddenly became more acute as his new pair of ears started moving around, scanning for sounds around him.<br />
<br />
At last he recognized clearly what grew out of him. It was now very obviously a giraffe&#39;s head and neck, with two new eyelids tightly closed. Building up his courage, he opened up the giraffe head&#39;s eyelids and was marveled at what he saw.<br />
<br />
He now had two distinct fields of view. The old one remained fixed over his right shoulder gazing at the giraffe head. The second was stationed on the giraffe head itself. Giraffes have eyes on either side their head, instead of the front, so Stan had a very wide field view up there. The giraffe head was still facing to his right, so that meant the &quot;right&quot; eye was pointing almost directly behind him while the &quot;left&quot; eye was facing ahead. Thus, with his four eyes, Stan was able to see almost anything in front of him, behind him, or to his right.<br />
<br />
Stan took several minutes just standing there getting acclimated to this before he finally began to experiment some more. He moved his big giraffe neck from the right side of his body to stretch straight out of his back. He now had two heads facing in directly opposite directions. He could see forward, left, and right. His ears twitched. His rat tail swished back and forth.<br />
<br />
Stan lifted both of his heads up and bumped his muzzle against the ceiling. Ouch, that hurt! Better tilt the giraffe head down...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I can see the ceiling and the floor at the same time!&quot; he exclaimed, his giraffe ears tilting back toward the sound of his human voice.<br />
<br />
Stan wonder what would happen next to his body.<br />
<br />

<br />
...<br />
<br />
While Stan was moving his new giraffe head around, a new head began growing<br />
<br />
With his old head on the right shoulder and the Giraffe head on the middle, a third one began growing on his left shoulder. The new head started out as a human one, but that soon began to change.<br />
<br />
First, his ears stretched and started to flap back and forth. He maneuvered his long giraffe neck around to get a better view of what might be happening and saw two big elephant ears attached to the new head!<br />
<br />
Then two big tusks grew out from his upper lip. He reached up a hand to touch them. He traced them down to their tips, which got further away from his face as he produced more and more ivory.<br />
<br />
When that subsided, his nose stretched out and it started to wave around involuntarily. Soon he gained some control over it, lifted it up, and trumpeted loudly. He now just had two animal heads: a giraffe&#39;s and an elephant&#39;s. However, the goat horns remained unchanged on the elephant head.<br />
<br />
Stan should have been a confused mess by now, with so many new sensory organs flooding him with impressions. Perhaps he couldn&#39;t have managed it all, except he now had two brains. He hadn&#39;t really thought much of that before, since they were apparently linked through his nervous system so flawlessly that he still just experienced himself as a single united mind. Yet, he kind of found himself wondering which thoughts were in which brain. His elephant head didn&#39;t feel more &quot;original&quot; than the other one anymore, his giraffe head was beginning to feel just as natural to him and his old head started feeling more original then the others with its reptilian muzzle and goat horns.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, he was struck by just how different from being human was the experience of being a chimera. He found himself taking stock of all the new moveable appendages he was coordinating: his long skinny tail, that towering giraffe neck, four twitching ears, and that ever-curious trunk! Not to mention his other changes thus far. All in addition to his arms, legs, torso and other appendages. And since the latter were still human, there was no way this transformation was over.<br />
