<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Name!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee Ryan Fowler!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Date of birth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;September 30, 1986 !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap your 17 years old, you signed the form as being 19!&quot; the man hollared at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Johnson, JOHNSON ! &quot;  screamed the man.<br />
<br />
In rushed another man thin, tall, and looking like he was scared about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what I've got for test subject, a 17 year old with nine injections. He's all ready into the first stages of the test and he's underage! What are you going to do about this little screw up?&quot; the Lab man demanded.<br />
<br />
I stood naked as the day I was born in my cage just looking at the tall man. He looked at the Lab Tech and then stepped over to peer at me. Walking to a desk he pulled out a book and paged well into it's pages. &quot;Yes, here you are a scenerio just as now!&quot; he pointed to the book.<br />
<br />
The Lab Tech walked over and read what was pointed out. A evil grin came over his face and then turning to the tall man he asked, &quot;OK, say it works, what about his guardians or parents won't they ask about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, once the test is in process I can pull his records from the data base and what remains is just a number and the ultimate end to a liar and one foolish boy.&quot; the tall man turns a glaring look at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey can I go home, sorry for the bother but I needed the money. I told nobody I was coming here! I came with Todd Moore he's a friend of my sister, it was him who suggested I register my name and your receptionist called me before even Todd. This is an experiance I won't forget, I'm sorry for lying and signing the application. Please let me go home!&quot; I asked but wasn't too sure as they looked back with cold faces.<br />
<br />
The tall man walked to the desk and paged a clipboard full of papers. With a quick move he tore on page off and handed it to the Lab Tech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really! I'm all for ending this coming problem and let the injections take their course.&quot; replied the Lab Tech.<br />
<br />
I looked from one to the other as suddenly in through the door burst two men struggling to control a huge male hog. As the tall man stood looking and the Lab Tech stepped closer he reached to a small table and quickly injected a seringe into the back of one mean looking hog.<br />
Soon enough the beasts legs crumpled to the ground with a thud.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's ready Sir, this is his four year since the test began. My chart shows he sired 3,911. piglets of which all survived. His next challange was to be tested for mental telepathic communication. He' in my opinion knows what and who he was, so this one should be a perfect choice for more testing.&quot; suggested the head guard or wrangler, whatever.<br />
<br />
The tall man smiles and points to me, &quot;this young one will replace Frank Marshone as we shall take and prepare him for testing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The big man wrangler walks over to peer at me through the bars of my cage. &quot;Bit small and scrauny isn't he!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but he's perfect, a 17 year old liar that snuck his way inside and hasn't told anybody where he went today! He was thinking this was a new learning experiance, he wouldn't lie again, will he?&quot; asked the tall man.<br />
<br />
The wrangler looks at me and then back to the Lab Tech. &quot;OK, say i agree, how long a duration on his test?&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall man looks at the Lab Tech and shruggs his shoulders. The Tech. turns to me and then looks the wrangler in the eye, &quot;Twenty plus!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wrangler looks at me and begins to laugh and laugh. &quot;Well there Test Subect number 02136 I can assure you an experiance which will be a learning time for your first year or so. Oh after that the patterns will become quite basic and your time will be filled with many friendly encounters. Ole' Frank there will be missed and by the time your ready to replace him those sows will be so horny they will have you going and going day and night for several months. Yup once the pretty sows capture a look at the new boar they will go crazy in love. Frank's job is done but it's my bet that your human mental patterns will be swallowed up by those instinctive notions to mount, hump, thrust, and ee'jock!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Frank Marshone, his body must weigh 400 pounds or more. He is covered in mud from the sty and as one looks at him I see nothing at all the even remote like looks human. He is 100% a big boar hog. As he stands now shaking on four legs those ten pound balls hang out behind those meaty hams. He stretches his stance and sniffs the air. I watch quite and the other to se one long, thick, and pinky clean penis strain out stiff and ready for mounting anything available.<br />
<br />
&quot;Him, I'm to be like him?&quot; I asked with a shake in my voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at first but over four or five months of change your body will make a fine looking boar. Oh, and what's more important my young friend, since your so young and still in a growth sputs the reframed body will be quite permanent. This will be the learn experiance of a lifetime! As a boy you were schooled, as a boar you shall be trained by the sting on a prod and the demands of your instincts. I tend to agree with the wrangler, your human thoughts, morals, and learned ways won't last the test of time. Indeed I expect you to be totally boar in about two months. After that we will treat the boar as a boar should be treated, with ropes, chains, and whatever to hold the beast in check.&quot; said the Tall man delighted to be rid of a small problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO, NO, I won't! Todd, Todd Moore my sister's boy friend he'll come back for me!&quot; I pleaded as my heart beat faster and the sight of being a stinking boar was still in my view.<br />
<br />
The Lab Tech walks out of the room as both wrangler and Tall man converse together. Just after a minute in walks the Lab Tech with a clipboard and a smile. He talks with the other men but I can not hear their words. At last the Lab Tech walks up to me and shows me his clipboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;See here on the top line, Test Subject # 02139, Todd Moore. You will be happy to know he signed up for our test #714. I think he'd planned to enjoy a larger penis and pleasure your sister. When you mention his name I made note and had his test number changed to #709. This test will increase that penis to a size your sister might not be to thrilled about. Todd has accepted and signed the forms to enter our special Zoophilia group. As his penis grows so also the special mind bending serums. In just hours he will feel a deep seated need to hump and mount in a more basic animal style. Your sister will not be what he's interested with, but only females with tails and hairy buttocks. He is perfect age and of big bone to make the transition from Homosapien' to that of our Bovine group test. I think about now he's realized the growth of that oversexed penis is passing the desired length and size. In fact his ears, skin, hair, eyes, lips, and other soft tissue will be making the big jump to Bovine rather quickly.&quot; the Lab Tech turns toward the doors he just walked through as both he and I hear Todd's scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sick, this place is evil sick! I think you are plain crazy to do things like this on good people.&quot; I argued as my hatered grew.<br />
<br />
The screams continued from Todd as minutes passed the tone became more deep and gutteral as his voice changed. The wrangler attached a pull bar to the front of my cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;WAIT,&quot; called the Tall man now standing nearest those door to Todd's personal hell.<br />
<br />
The sounds of a scuffle and those doors burst open. Three security men with ropes had a creature in tow. The monster was wrenching his forelegs about trying to release the ropes which held him so tight. As he got more into the light I saw his red fur and white belly fur, huge hind cloven hooves, and his tail whipping about. As he lifted his head and turned my way he stopped his fighting.  He peered over at me and I to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee Ryan Fowler, I'm pleased for you to meet Mr. Todd Moore who you knew as your sister's boyfriend, soon to be a Polled Hereford bull!&quot; said the Tall man in a galant way.<br />
<br />
The bull snorted and then raised his great and growing head to sniff the air for scent. &quot;OH Todd it's me Lee, I'm sorry you are in this mess too!&quot; I exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The bull began to drag deep breaths. He looked first to the Lab Tech and then to the Tall man. A sigh as if calming down he tucked his strange half bull and human faced head to his hairy chest. A minute ticked by as if he was lost in a beastial wilderness.<br />
<br />
Then he bolted for the Tall man knocking him backwards into the rear wall. the man crumpled down into a lump of bleeding flesh. In a split seconfd he swung at the three wranglers and they were knocked to the grond. As they fell the ropes of his control sliped from their grasp. The Lab Tech ran for the door but Frank the boar turned and gave one friendly nudge which sent him to the ground. Frank turned and walking to the Tech man began to lay his weight across as if to crush him.<br />
<br />
Todd bolted for my cage and with one blast it burst open. I gave his hairy head a pat and raced back into the holding area to find my clothes, and then a phone for the police.  Todd and Frank carried on the fight as I heard bellowing, squealing and men yelling in the back area of the building.<br />
<br />
I had to find some clothes, checking room after room they were clean and clear of all personal belongings. At last i came into a room which had a pair of pants, a shirt, and shoes on a chair. As I grabbed for them a hairy hand and arm grabbed me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast there, oh your so nice looking, please may I just touch your little....&quot; the voice said.<br />
<br />
I turned my head and was stunned. There standing as if he had just fallen from a book on myths stood one tall handsome male satyr. Great ringed horns and his anture of being both gay and horny did nothing but make me more scared. I grabbed for his clothes as his mouth and lips wrapped my pretty 17 year old penis. <br />
<br />
Getting into his shirt was a tough time while he was stroking me with hairy hands and sucking me into new worlds of sexual delight. After a couple of tries I found myself just standing there, eyes closed and sucking up his wonderful attentions. It didn't matter, I was in love, he was so great, this could go on forever, I won't mind!<br />
<br />
&quot;I like young and youthful satyr's, they helped me be as i always wanted and now I'm to be placed where others like us live in love.&quot; said the love struck satyr creature.<br />
<br />
That's when I looked down to see my penis not looking like the one I was born with, but for the satyr's desire I now had a full hairy sheath and with little doubt a goat's shaft. The touch and sucking coupled with those injections, now my form and fate was sealed. I was to be a satyr too, maybe better than being a boar hog, but still less than my hope's and wishes.</p>
