<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Cut him some clack, Theresa!” Trixie responded, flying in front of her, “he might not have breasts where he comes from.” She looked at Eric, “maybe there aren’t girls...” she said. She flew towards him, fluttering around his head and body,<br />
“I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s never even seen a girl,” Theresa commented.<br />
<br />
Trixie’s torso was barely the size of Eric’s fist. She was a fairy, flying around using two blue wings. She was wearing a little blue dress that Eric couldn’t help but notice accentuated her bust.<br />
<br />
“I...” Eric blurted out, very confused,<br />
“It speaks!” A voice said, Eric looked down to see a smaller girl. Not small like Trixie, but small like... short. A dwarf!<br />
She was the only one wearing metal armour, aside from the odd metal shoulder pad on a couple of the girls. She was pretty, with very messy blonde hair, covered with dirt. When she opened her mouth, Eric noticed two buck teeth, but it didn’t detract from her. She wasn’t as stocky as Eric would’ve expected a dwarf to be, in fact she was quite lean. If it wasn’t for her wide hips, breasts, and fairly large muscles, Eric could’ve mistook her for a child, “why is he just sitting there?” She asked, looking at Roxie,<br />
“You think I know?” Roxie responded, “I only summoned him. All I know is the key to helping us,”<br />
“You’re telling me... that?” Theresa butted, “that is what’s gonna save this kingdom?”<br />
“N-not necessary,” Claire said, only just looking at Eric, “but he is the key to helping us,” she said, looking deep into his eyes.<br />
Eric had absolutely no idea what was going on, but for some reason, her eyes gave him hope. And enough confidence to finally say something,<br />
“W-what’s going on...” he asked,<br />
“Is that part not obvious!?” Theresa said, but was immediately silenced by Claire, who waved her hand and forced her mouth shut. Theresa gave a grumpy scowl to Claire before walking again into the corner,<br />
“Let us explain what has happened,” Claire started,<br />
<br />
“Two weeks ago,” Claire began, “Marythorn the 13th took over this kingdom. Using her powerful magic, she turned to King and Queen to gold, and took control of the royal guardsmen. Not everyone is under her spell, some may resist it, but to those who do, they will suffer terrible transformations before locking them deep away in the dungeons,”<br />
“S-so... who are you?” Eric asked, looking at everyone,<br />
“These are my friends. Marythorn planned her attack strategically. Once a large festival was taking place, Kings and Queens, Prince’s and Princess’, all from many worlds were invited. Each one of us are Princess’ from another kingdom. Marythorn’s power is too strong to take us elsewhere, but Roxie was able to use her own magic to bring you here. Eric, you are our last hope,” she said, grabbing his hands and holding them. Her pink hair really seemed to shine,<br />
“O-okay. I’ll help...” Eric said, not sure what else to respond with,<br />
“Excellent!” Claire said, relived, “now let me introduce you to our team!” She ordered everyone to line up in a row, they complied,<br />
“You’ve spoken to Trixie, and of course you’ve met Theresa,”<br />
“It’s hard to miss her,” Trixie commented with her high-pitched voice, Theresa scowled at her,<br />
“And this is Nalra,” she said, leaning down to place her hands on Nalra’s shoulders. Nalra appeared to be the blonde dwarf that he’d met beforehand,<br />
“This one here is Roxie,” Claire explained, standing behind a girl with a similar height to Eric. She had dark skin and snow white hair. She wore a long dress-like coat that covered all but her legs. Her legs were covered with a very tight fabric. She had large boots on underneath.<br />
“This one is Faelyn,” she said. Eric’s eyes were immediately drawn to Faelyn’s ears. She seemed to be some kind of wolf-cat-girl-thing... Eric couldn’t quite place his finger on what her animal half was, so he settled knowing the other half was human. She had a thin layer of further spread over her body, it easily blended in as skin. However, there was a lot of fur in some places. For example, her hands- paws... her wrists were covered in fur that lead up to her paw-like hands. She also had paw-like feet, but they looked more like feet than the hands looked like hands, just raises up a little. Her eyes were large and very cute, as was her little button nose. Although her body was covered in hair, she still had her normal hair styled, it was short a dark brown colour, unlike her skin. And her last biggest feature would be her large fluffy tail. Eric wasn’t into the whole ‘furry’ thing, but seeing one in real life was surreal.<br />
“And then finally, there’s me!” Claire said. She was surprisingly the least interesting person there. Aside from her bright pink hair, she seemed fairly normal. She didn’t have many curves, she wasn’t beautiful beyond imagine. She was the closest to a human.<br />
<br />
Eric stood there, looking at the six women, not sure what to do,<br />
“S-so... what do I need to do?” He asked,<br />
“You can join me in locating the Book of Rose,”<br />
“The book of what?” Eric asked,<br />
“Oh my gods,” Theresa said, facepalming herself, “even I know what the Book of Rose is,”<br />
Eric stood there awkwardly,<br />
“The Book of Rose is an ancient book filled with unimaginable power. It is said that whoever reads many alter reality in any way they please, without restrictions,”<br />
“Is that the power Marythorn is using?” Eric asked. Some of the girls also wondered this,<br />
“No. The book is has only ever presented it to 3 separate people over the past 5 millennia passed,”<br />
“What!?” All the girls said in sync,<br />
“And why will it present itself to me?” Eric asked,<br />
“Eric. You are a mortal human from the Milky Way, correct?”<br />
“Uhm... yeah?”<br />
“Why on Sionia would you have been brought here if the book won’t present itself to you,”<br />
Everybody agreed that Claire had a good point.<br />
<br />
“Time is running thin,” Claire said, “we must locate the book and return quickly,”<br />
“O-okay!” Eric said, following what she says,<br />
“Girls. You must stay here, if you can, try and find any reasonable passageway. But you must be safe, and work together,”<br />
“We’ll do our best!” Trixie replied,<br />
“Good luck!” Three of the girls said at once,<br />
“And also with you,” Claire said, “we must go,” she said to Eric, bending over and beginning to go through a small tunnel.<br />
Eric looked back, seeing the remaining girls watching him. He felt a little awkward, but knew the stakes were high, so he just did what she said. This was the first time he’d been the centre of attention with a group of girls before, so he was focussed on making a good impression. He got down to his knees and started crawling behind Claire.<br />
<br />
Little did Eric know, the true evil that awaited him.</p>
