<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His coworkers, almost a dozen of them now animal people, living their lives and none the wiser. It was incredible in a way. <br />
<br />
Whoever had the pen, had reality in their pocket. He could make dictatorships democracies, he could write diseases out of existence, and while there was clearly a butterfly effect, the revisions seemed to be limited to the individual, for now. Still he was hesitant, who knew what gigantic changes would do to the world, or who it would get the attention of. He could just ask the pen, but if it had any awareness, it was clear it wanted to be used, and used to full effect.&#8232;&#8232;On the plus side, he found out that the pen couldn&#39;t kill, hopefully that meant it could NEVER do anything that would accidentally write a person out of existence. &#8232;&#8232;He went to Nicole&#39;s office-slash-playroom. The place was set up for the mundane mindless grunt work that Nick had been doing anyway, except now Nichole seemed to be doing it with a lot more string in her step, and looking to be perfectly happy about it. <br />
<br />
Looking at Nicole, she looked so damn, HAPPY, it felt actually like a crime to age her up, plus she had her whole life ahead of her, it actually felt like he would be STEALING to age her into an adult. Besides, Mikki for her part was perfectly happy as a teenager working for the company, and Nicole looked perfectly happy as a child, so why should he disrupt their happiness?&#8232;&#8232;Dave wondered about child labor laws, but no one seemed to give Nicole being here any thought, and it was clear she wasn&#39;t being used or exploited. &#8232;&#8232;She was having tea and a fish sandwich with her dolls.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Hi Nicole.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Davvey!&quot; She waved cutely.&#8232;&#8232;&quot;How are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I&#39;m feeling okay, uh . . . sorry about that prank this morning.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;Dave shuddered. &quot;It&#39;s okay Nicole, we know you were just playing.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;Dave wrote on a small note pad. &#8232;&#8232;&#39;Nicole will answer these next questions honestly and won&#39;t think them strange.&#39; &#8232;&#8232;&quot;Nicole, do you like being a little girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Oh yes! It&#39;s fun! I get to do important stuff but play at the same time, and all the adults like me! Some of the older kids don&#39;t that adults trust me with so much stuff, but I&#39;m told not to let bullies get to you.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Would you want to be an adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I&#39;ve always been an adult comes in time, and that I shouldn&#39;t rush it.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Is there anything you want more than anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot; . . . I wish I had a playmate at work,&quot; her voice took on a slightly lonely tone.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Thank you Nicole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;You&#39;re welcome!&quot;&#8232;&#8232;He looked at Lucy. Samantha&#39;s assistant in PR. She had always been eager to help, but being more of a muse than an idea woman herself. <br />
<br />
And Dave thought how an innocent and cute face in Public Relationships could do wonders, or simply have a different point of view. &#8232;&#8232;&#39;Lucy will transform into a humanoid gazelle that is around Nicole&#39;s age, they&#39;ll be best of friends, always look out for each other, and can always rely on each other. Lucy will be a boon to the PR department in her own special way. And both Nicole and Lucy will be happy. Mikki will not have trouble looking after both of them at work while still doing her own job.&#39;&#8232;&#8232;Lucy&#39;s clothes faded away, and he could see her extremely hot figure, but didn&#39;t feel as overwhelmingly attracted to her as he thought he would, then again, she was a mammal, he was a reptile. &#8232;&#8232;Her age reversed on her, going past puberty, he breasts shrinking to nothing,and her figure becoming rounder, at the same time, covering everything at a fast pace, was white fur covering the inside of her limbs and her front and neck, black fur that went as a strip down her entire body, and brown fur that covered the outside of her body and backside. Two tiny stubs of horns formed on her head, as her ears grew quite large, and her eyes became large and solid black, while her face became a muzzle. Her limbs became thinner, and more delicate, while her feet became hooves made to balance on two legs, while her hands came four digits each, ending in armored fingers that clicked whenever she tapped them together. A tiny thin tail emerged from her rear. &#8232;&#8232;The office blurred and did some rearranging, and now Lucy&#39;s office was right next to Nicole&#39;s &#39;office&#39; and the two merged together, the wall between them having been taken out ages ago. &#8232;&#8232;Now Nichole and Lucy were chatting up a storm, talking about the little imagery soap opera that had going with their dolls, and how things were going in their respective branches of the company. Lucy was now wearing a set of blue bows that mirrored Nicole&#39;s pink ones, except the last one was around her waist rather than her tiny tail. &#8232;&#8232;And the two looked positively adorable together. It would be a crime to separate them.<br />
<br />
And that now made twelve people he had transformed with the pen. <br />
<br />
Of course this company had more than one or two dozen employees, but Dave had time. He was no rush (hopefully). <br />
<br />
He wrote down, &#39;Jodie will come to my office as soon as it is practical.&#39;<br />
<br />
A minute later, Jodie walked into the room. She had her hair done up in a pun and had glasses on. &quot;Hello Mr. Adamson, I&#39;ve heard that Mike is being transferred, and I&#39;ll be working under you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you friends with Mike?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a good friend. I&#39;m sorry to see him go. But I promise I&#39;ll be you secretary to the best of my ability,&quot; she said calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to hear it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave calmly wrote on a piece of paper,<br />
<br />
&#39;Jodie will turn into a completely naked snake woman with a hood, she will not have legs. She won&#39;t need her glasses. She will be a very loyal secretary and can be trusted with anything I tell her not to repeat it to others.&#39; <br />
<br />
Jodie&#39;s clothes were the first to go, leaving her looking like a piece of performance art with how calm and collected and business like she was. <br />
<br />
Her body was soon covered in a pattern of dark and bright green scales, her legs melted together and tapered into a long thick talk behind her. She look like she could now rise herself taller than even Dave now she wanted or touch the ceiling. She was no longer sitting in the chair but her tail coiled underneath her. Scales now served for modesty. Her bust size of course &#39;level-uped&#39;. Claws formed on her hands, though they were more slenderly and graceful than Dave&#39;s. Though her tail looked like she could crush him if she tried. A large serpent&#39;s hood folded out from the sides of her head and neck. Her eyes lost their eyelids and she stared relentlessly at Dave even if she didn&#39;t notice any of her changes. A forked tongue slipped out of her mouth tasting the air. Her face flatted and lengthened slightly, becoming more reptilian in design.  A unique pattern formed on her backside. <br />
<br />
She hissed through fangs, &quot;Sir, if there is anything you need, tell me, and I shall do as you command.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone told you you are incredibly beautiful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir, Mike said much the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Josie, I&#39;d like to enjoy my last day in my old cubical.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish sir, see you tomorrow.&quot; The serpintine beauty slithered out, Dave actually hypnotized a little by how her large sexy tail swam behind her almost. &#8232;&#8232;Seeing he still had a little time left, he left his office again and went down to the place of damned souls, better known as the telemarketer section.&#8232;&#8232;These were the people without friends, family, and had long since given up all hopes and dreams. They saw none as people, including themselves, only number to call, voices on the other end to make a sales pitch to, in the mindless futile task that maybe one of them will accept the offer. Not to mention how many people considered telemarketing itself criminal. &#8232;&#8232;These men had long since lost their souls, and were doomed to their futile existence forever that was part of the tiny gears that made up the big machine. &#8232;&#8232;Well, if they were going to be machines, they might as well be. &#8232;&#8232;He wrote down.&#8232;&#8232;&#39;Any of the telemarketers in the telemarketing section, who fit my stereotype I&#39;m thinking of: of a soulless drone who has already lost their humanity and with no loved ones or family, will transform into android girls. They will be completely capable of emotions, and free will, and be respected as PEOPLE and individuals with rights and privileged rather than pieces of equipment by the company and everyone else. Any that don&#39;t fit, instead have jobs at the company that make them him happy and fit their skill level and ability.&#39; &#8232;&#8232;Half the tele-marketers in the room vanished, the other half began to change.&#8232;&#8232;Their skin became shinny like plastic, their eyes looked possessed and doll like, and all became became young, innocent, and girlie looking. Some were dressed in fluffy dresses, while a couple were wearing swim suits! One was wearing a tank top and shorts and was bare foot. A thin white dress. Their hair, it was mostly long and platinum blond, but others had it blue, green, neon-red, cut short, boyish, in spiral curls. It made the telemarketer&#39;s section look like an anime convention. Their ears now looked like little plastic cell phones almost the same color as their air. &#8232;&#8232;The SHOCKING part was that they were all smiling!&#8232;&#8232;Cords were jacked into their ears, and they seemed to be doing their job of calling potential clients, and happily chatting the day away with each other at the same time! Seemed their sale pitches didn&#39;t take much brain power. &#8232;&#8232;Some chatted about their hobbies, others about boys, the &#39;younger&#39; ones chatted about colorful ponies, some chatted about the newest action movie others mentioned the latest internet meme. All in all, they acted more alive and more human than when they had been human! &#8232;&#8232;Their relentlessly cheerful demeanor Dave would find had actually increased ever so slightly the number of clients won from the unholy practice of telemarketing. &#8232;&#8232;Dave for a bit feared he might have turned them into slaves, but when Dave looked over the books, if ANYTHING, they now had a BETTER contract with the company than they did before! Apparently now that they were expensive machines rather than expendable grunts who you could replace with the blink of an eye, the company had to treat them with respect least they go to ANOTHER company to serve their chosen function. <br />
<br />
That was twelve people he had transformed at once. Jumping the number to twenty-four!<br />
<br />
He wrote down on the posted note, &#39;Each one will tell me their name, in turn, none will question this or find it strange.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultratron64.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mimime.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thunderfist1600.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apple.&quot; Said the youngest looking one with short blond hair and a white dress.<br />
&quot;Susan.&quot;<br />
&quot;Linxus101.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sakura99.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jannice.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ashley.&quot; Said the tomboy one with short red hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;MegaPowa-1.&quot; Said the biggest busted one there by fair with long purple hair and locks. <br />
&quot;Laura.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sarah.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you ladies, carry on.&quot;</p>
