<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James flinched as the door to the bathroom flew open, letting out a yelp as the sudden movement sent a jolt of pain rocketing up his leg from his ankle. Now that the adrenaline and shock had worn off, the pain in his leg had come on full force. The journey back had been agony, every step a jolt of nauseating pain. He was so exhausted now his head only stayed up a moment to see his mother, hair still dripping from a shower, before falling back down and staring at the sky.<br />
<br />
Jess, had had a different experience during the journey home. In no pain, other than the exertion of carrying the weight of her significantly larger brother, she had nothing to distract her from the closeness to James. The closeness to his new appendage.<br />
<br />
With trembling, lingering hands, Jess had managed to stuff James&#39;s horse cock into his pants and zipped up the straining fabric before they set off. hiding did little to distract her from the thought of it however.<br />
<br />
The Cabin&#39;s thrall had begun to work several times during the journey home, each time only the yelps of pain from James kept her from stopping, throwing him to the ground and having her way with him.<br />
<br />
Something clicked then with Jess. With what was happening here, she was going to have sex soon. It was inevitable.<br />
<br />
It would be her first time. <br />
<br />
Instinctively looked at her Dad.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Joan was not impressed at being interrupted. She had been spending her bathroom time first showering, then working on a mindfulness routine, trying to come to terms with the changes to her body, and how they would likely impact her marriage. Willing to apply the mindfulness principals, she was willing to just see what accepting her body would be like. She had really begun to visualise her interactions with family members, how she would let them know about her cock when she had been snapped out of her seance.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of scanning the room, Joan picked out James lying on the bed. He did look hurt; cuts, bruises, dried blood flaking his neck. A motherly instinct did trigger as she rushed over, beginning to fuss over her boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;He fell from a tree..&quot; Jess volunteered. Joan turned to see her daughter, flushed, sweating, with earnest eyes. <br />
<br />
Joan turned back to see James nodding and with a grimace pointing to his ankle. &quot;I think I might have done some damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan scanned the ankle and leg and <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot; She gasped, eyes bulging. She had noticed the snake in James&#39;s pants. Her cock jumped to attention within two heartbeats. Her eyes flicked up, James had flopped back, staring at the ceiling. Spinning she saw Henry momentarily distracted, picking up a lamp that had been knocked over while carrying James in. Jess...<br />
<br />
Fuck...<br />
<br />
Jess was staring right at her. Except. Lower. Joan looked down at her midriff. Her straining erection was painfully obvious. A tingling feeling oursed through her lower belly. She had to save this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much worse than I thought! I&#39;ll need space to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned, back to Henry and Jess, turning her head slightly. James looked up again with a worried &quot;Huh!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably best if you two leave. I&#39;ll shout if I need help.&quot; Joan bossed in her most business like tone.<br />
<br />
Not a medical professional and with no way of knowing better, Henry, just wanting to help nodded. &quot;We&#39;ll be in the living room honey. Anything at all and we&#39;ll come running.&quot; He turned to leave, took a few steps, then paused.<br />
<br />
Jess was rooted into spot, staring at her mother. It looked like she wanted to stay or say something. &#39;Poor thing just wants to help&#39; Henry thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon you&quot; His hand slipped into hers. Turning her and pulling her towards the door.<br />
<br />
Jess blushed at the feeling of her hand being enveloped by her father&#39;s large strong hand. She turned back and forth a few times, turning between father and mother. The backs of both of their heads. <br />
<br />
Just as she was being pulled through the doorway, her mother turned. Jess could see a smile on her face, and a tent in her dress.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Husband and daughter out of the room Joan quickly padded over to the door. She found herself moving as quietly as she could. Reaching the doorway she peered around the corner. Both Jess and Henry had disappeared. She turned and quietly closed the door, holding her breath as it closed with a soft *click*.<br />
<br />
She paused. Reflecting on what was happening, letting her mindfulness take over, just watching her thoughts as an outside observer. Why was she closing the door? <br />
Privacy.<br />
Why?<br />
Penis?<br />
Yes... but not hers.<br />
James&#39;s. She wanted to see it.<br />
<br />
She shook her head, back in the room. Looking down she saw that she had locked the door. That was surprising.<br />
<br />
She paused again... Tenting erection. Salivating mouth. She knew what her mind was telling her, should she accept it?</p>
