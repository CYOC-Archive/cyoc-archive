<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought for a few moments, before saying, &quot;Is there any other body you can give me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we only have two bodies on file for your location,&quot; said Frank. &quot;I would give you another body, but there&#39;s a whole mess of quantum physics that makes it impossible for us to make targeted changes from a distance. I&#39;d try to explain why, but it&#39;s all really technical. Even I don&#39;t understand some of the details of it, and I have a doctorate in particle physics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Jeff, looking crestfallen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy?&quot; said Jamie. &quot;Who are you talking to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute, Jamie,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our hands are a bit tied, you see,&quot; said Frank. &quot;We can only make changes in that location based on the information we received from your Chronivac. And, well, we only received information on two bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff realized what his options were. He looked at Jamie with her grown up body and shuddered at the thought of what he was about to ask Frank to do. &quot;So, only my body and my sister&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; said Frank.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to his confused looking sister. &quot;Jamie,&quot; he said gently. &quot;Could you leave me alone for a few minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;Fine! But, I want to use your computer later. Can I use it later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;You can use it later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled and kissed his forehead. &quot;Thanks, Jeffy,&quot; she said and walked away.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched her go, examining her body from behind as she left. He took a deep breath and sighed. He couldn&#39;t believe what he was about to say. &quot;Can you swap this body with my sister&#39;s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Frank, looking a bit confused. &quot;Um, let me see if I understand you right. You want me to give you your sister&#39;s body and her yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed and avoided looking the hologram of Frank in the eyes. &quot;I figure it would be better to have a grown up body than a kid&#39;s. I don&#39;t think I could stand waiting for weeks as an 8-year-old, and Jamie&#39;s still got her 10-year-old mind in a 20-year-old&#39;s body, so this would really be a bit more age-appropriate, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Frank. &quot;You do realize that you will be female?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...for at least a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Very well then. At TransDem we&#39;re not in the habit of judging our customers&#39; choices. We do cater to much more...&quot; He searched for a diplomatic word. &quot;...exotic tastes, after all.&quot; Frank keyed in the changes as Jeff anxiously watched his hologram. It took Frank a minute to complete the coding since there were some tricky reality alterations accompanying this body swap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Frank as he finished typing. &quot;Everything looks ready to go. Took a bit of creative coding, but it should all be quite seamless.&quot; Frank paused, feeling proud of his work. He looked at anxious little Jeff. &quot;One last time, are you sure you want to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at his feet. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank pressed a button and Jeff immediately started to grow. Too many things were changing for him to take it all in at once. He felt himself growing taller and simultaneously older. His hair was growing out on his head, tickling the back of his neck as it rapidly lengthened to match Jamie&#39;s long, blonde hair. His face seemed to be reshaping and felt tingly, and he felt a pulling sensation in his groin. His innards were rearranging as his penis shrank, his scrotum pulling up into his body and reforming into a feminine vagina. As his body passed puberty, his hips widened and his butt plumped, while his nipples tingled and quickly inflated with breast tissue. All the while his clothes were reforming themselves into a dress, identical to the one his sister had been wearing. Everything swelled and stretched and grew seemingly out of control until suddenly, it stopped.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt very disorientated. He shook his head to try to refocus his mind and felt his long hair whip around wildly. He looked around himself at his room. His walls were still covered with the same band posters, but there was now a vanity in the corner, makeup strewn across it&#39;s surface. And he could see new clothes stuffed into a bursting closet, fuzzy and gauzy items mixed with skirts and dresses that hadn&#39;t been there moments ago. He took a deep breath and looked down at his body, his gaze immediately caught by the view of his new cleavage. His breasts were huge! This had to be a mistake, he thought - Jamie&#39;s breasts couldn&#39;t have been this big! Without thinking, he brought his hands up to cup them. The sensation of his large breasts in his dainty female hands was incredible. Maybe the next few weeks would be alright after all, he thought. This could be fun! He heard a little moan escape his lips, which shocked him back to reality. He jerked his hands away from his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man,&quot; he said, hearing a strange, more feminine voice emerge from his own mouth. He looked over at the semi-transparent Frank and blushed. Jeff had all but forgotten that he wasn&#39;t alone. &quot;Can we just pretend that that didn&#39;t happen?&quot; said Jeff, still weirded out by his girlish voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t see a thing,&quot; said Frank, playing dumb. &quot;Nothing at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Jeff. He looked behind himself to see his giant ass. No doubt about it. From the neck down, he was every bit as curvy as his sister had looked minutes ago. &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Frank, sounding impatient now. &quot;If you&#39;re satisfied with your customer support here, then I need to get going. I have a few reports to file and a lot of meetings to get to later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed, knowing he should feel more uncomfortable with this last change. Instead he found himself quite excited to experience life as the other gender for a month. Trying to mask his eagerness, he replied, &quot;I guess this is the best we can do for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Frank, who then added as an aside, &quot;Oh, by the way, Jamie can still be &#39;Jamie,&#39; but your new name is Jenny, or Jennifer. It was the closest thing to Jeff I could come up with as far as girls&#39; names go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Jenny?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She rolled the thought of being Jenny for a month around in her head. It felt... right. Probably because Frank had altered reality to make her Jenny, but still... &quot;Alright, I guess I&#39;m good for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, good luck, Jenny,&quot; said Frank as his hologram started to dissolve. &quot;We&#39;ll be in touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
