<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(A/N: Geeze, I hope I didn't tick you off with my previous episode. When I saw Loony <br />
starting to add episodes I was left kinda stunned... mostly cause his character was totally <br />
out of the blue and I felt their introduction was totally illogical (and seemed to be buddy <br />
buddy with a character from just about every faction!) and felt like a character born to be a <br />
plot device to fix everything. And the idea of a new set of antagonists completely ruins the <br />
sense of conclusion the story was reaching before. However, as they saying goes, 'I have <br />
stood all I can stand and I shall stand no more and get back to writing my own episodes.)<br />
<br />
Trevor knew he was dreaming this time, his mind not hand waving the logic of him being <br />
in a bus station with the kittens playing with a ball of yarn larger than Paul while perfectly <br />
normal humans with animal heads went about their daily business going this way and that <br />
politely stepping around the cats.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is one weird dream.&quot; Trevor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me for saying so dear,&quot; Said Queen some space away from him, &quot;But you aren't <br />
fairly messed up in the head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't deny that coming from you.&quot; Trevor said turning to look at the queen tabby, she <br />
had a red collar around her neck connected by a red chain to a red grip that Trevor had his <br />
left paw over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Trevor, you keep waking me up. And that shouldn't be possible for a cat... I <br />
think I've become like that black cat Judas, I'm 'tainted', but it doesn't -feel- like a taint, it <br />
feels like the universe is bigger somehow, that I can ... that I can... I don't know. But I feel <br />
-larger- somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor thought of everything he had done with Madam Serenity, &quot;... join the club... <br />
Queen... what is that thing around your neck?&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen looked at the bus waiting outside the station then back at Trevor, &quot;Your unresolved <br />
feelings for me hold me prisoner here Trevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't be free until you let me and yourself be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen, stop talking in riddles I'm a fellow cat aren't I? What do you mean?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Queen pleaded with tears in her eyes, &quot;Trevor... you need to let me go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I can't!&quot; A another chain appeared this one was black connected from her collar to a <br />
shackle around his left front paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor, animals or people, I was just becoming aware of life's possibilities when the <br />
monster killed me, but I do know this much. Death isn't something to be loved or <br />
admired, but it's not something to be ignored or trivialized either! Animals don't come <br />
back from the dead Trevor not ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Trevor snarled, another red chain, this one a lot thicker and heavier, this one nearly <br />
caused Queen's head to hit the floor, and this one ended up being connected right around <br />
Trevor's own neck, &quot;This game can do anything right-?!  It can make anything happen <br />
right-?! Then I can make it so you come back to life! If Jesus can resurrected Lazarus then <br />
I can bring you back!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor,&quot; Queen shuddered her ears on flattening on the top of her head, &quot;Please stop, <br />
you're not a god, you don't have the right to make that call.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cats were worshiped as sacred by the Egyptians weren't they?!&quot; Another chain, this one <br />
twisted and warped. <br />
<br />
&quot;And were called agents of evil in other places...  Trevor, stop, please stop. ... I'm not <br />
coming back.. but unless you free us both I can never leave! Our kittens were a possibility <br />
Trevor, one that can no longer be. Just stop. Please. Don't you think I'd beg scream whine <br />
and plead to everything and everyone if I thought it could bring us back together? Do you <br />
think I WANT our kittens never to be born?... But they're never going to be born Trevor... &quot;<br />
<br />
Queen moved, the chains binding her to Trevor making the task not an easy one, she <br />
came close and nuzzled him, &quot;You are a most unusual tom, you caused me to become <br />
quite the unusual queen. Because I want something that has nothing to do with continuing <br />
the species as I've produced with many other toms, and thus goes against the rules. I want <br />
you to be -happy-. And you can only find happiness again, is if you let me go... I want <br />
you to move on Trevor, so please, let ME move on! SHOW ME YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor was thunder struck. He opened and closed his mouth several times. He looked at <br />
the litter he would never have. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Trevor... you're not a coward.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... go on, you don't wanna miss your bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
The chains shattered into nothing as the collars and grips fell apart, the kittens vanished, <br />
Queen licked his face once and leapt across the court and onto the bus. The bus driver <br />
gave Trevor a pleasant wave, Trevor gave the dark robed skeleton the single most defiant <br />
look he could.  The bus then drove away Queen giving Trevor one last wave. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Brian apologized to Serenity for his attitude, &quot;Felicity and I were playing <br />
bad cop/good cop with Ashley before the police came trying to get anything out of her but <br />
she was as fanatic as a cultist. And to be frank, the way you've described Jensen so far is <br />
as something that's inhuman, the way those wolves acted was certainly inhuman enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity nodded calmly and cooly, &quot;Then I'm glade we got it settled between us then <br />
before I stereotyped you as blind blood thirsty zealot killers just looking for excuses to <br />
murder someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian and Felicity just nodded, &quot;That would hardly be civilized.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the irony of being civilized, there was a strangely liberating feeling the lions felt at <br />
going around in the fur.<br />
<br />
'Maybe civilized has more to do with how you treat your fellow person?' Felicity thought, <br />
'No one had given us anymore of a look than you would any extra unique person, and <br />
we're in the middle of a police station and no one has once offered us a towel or <br />
threatened to arrest us for public nudity! And I think... I think I LIKE it... ' Felicity looked <br />
down at her own maternal material, finally having a breather to do so, they were fairly <br />
correct given her new size, but still decidedly smaller then she thought they'd be given her <br />
new height 'Then again, it's the lioness that does the hunting, it not biologically logical for <br />
me to carrying around a lot of dead weight if I'm doing that.'<br />
<br />
&quot;DID SHE SAY Jennifer Smith?!&quot; Said a tabby as it burst into the office being carried by a <br />
orangoutang. <br />
<br />
-Everyone- turned to look at them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did the wolf say Jennifer Smith? Was that the name they gave as 'The Master?' &quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe it...&quot; Trevor whispered, &quot;I just don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor what is it?&quot; Mary asked her fellow feline. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer Smith was a hot girl I was on the list for being to date along with a bunch of <br />
other guys... rich family, treated anyone she didn't like as if they were dirt and treated her <br />
friends like they were going to be her commanding officers for her army after she <br />
conquered the world. Or that's how I saw her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wanted to still date her?&quot; the cub Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was rich, she was pretty, she knew how to please a guy, she knew how to take <br />
command of a situation, she knew what she wanted and how to take it, those were traits I <br />
admired at the time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask me again when I figured how what part is my own choices and what part is my brain <br />
chemistry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would someone mind tell me who just burst into MY office?&quot; Gill asked not amused by <br />
this in the least. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gill,&quot; Serenity said, &quot;This is Trevor, a high school student perma-cursed into a cat, and <br />
this is Paul, brother of the priest I mentioned before who gave me the formula for the <br />
cure.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heel-low.&quot; The great ape said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And why are they here?&quot; Gill asked agitated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor is my work partner now, and Paul has insisted on being my body guard until the <br />
pack is no longer a threat.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Surprised you'd let anyone get permanently involved in your work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor is like me, and so is Paul, and pretty much every changed in this room, the curse <br />
can't restore us, so we aren't in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity said, &quot;Ashley I think proved that there is no such thing as the 'truly locked' form.&quot;  <br />
Felicity looked at Chief Gill, &quot;So are you a cursed too sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would make you say that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the only police officer we've met so far whose recognized us being lion people as <br />
being a result of the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU'RE KIDDING!&quot; Bobbi declared. Looking at the lion people in the room, &quot;But I <br />
REMEMBER seeing you people around town.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Also odd that Bobbi in spite of being a changed by the curse didn't recognize them as <br />
being altered.&quot; Serenity said. <br />
<br />
Mary held her head, &quot;This curse makes my head hurt!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Join the club sissy cat!&quot; Trevor snapped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that how you speak to your friends brat?&quot; Gill said to the cat. <br />
<br />
&quot;What friends?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you have any friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I make friends, anything I say or try to communicate with them becomes meaningless <br />
babble, the jerkass who cursed me was a sadistic maniac in my humble opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul was luckier in that regard, his speaking was clumsy, but he could still write well <br />
enough, and his sign language (for those who understood it) was flawless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't recall seeing a missing person report for a 'Trevor' ever... &quot; Gill said, his secret <br />
shame at not facing the curse left him memorizing missing person reports knowing they <br />
were likely a octopus in someone's basement somewhere or someone's new solid gold <br />
figurine. <br />
<br />
Trevor shivered, &quot;My Dare was to fake my suicide....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you contact your family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It all becomes meows to them, weather it's written, typed, or spoke, doesn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill himself shivered, most people weren't this thorough in this sadistic descriptions when <br />
they cursed someone.   Most gave the victim a lope-sided fighting chance for their own <br />
amusement, sounded like whoever had cursed Trevor had made sure there was no way to <br />
win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that Gill had gotten Trevor started he had to say the lot, &quot;And to top it off that I'd die <br />
-within twenty years-... It's a giant russian roulette!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it 'die at the end of twenty years?&quot; Mary asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's WITHIN twenty years, it doesn't matter if it's been two years or nineteen, twenty is <br />
simply when I loose automatically, like a game with a timer, doesn't matter if I have eight <br />
lives left at the end, I suffer a fatal heart attack at a wild card value or get hit by a random <br />
car. This guy made sure that this curse would do me NO FAVORS. He left the ability for me <br />
to speak but never to friends or family to MOCK ME!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Ashley sat in her cell docile, across on the other side of the bars (the mirror removed at <br />
her own request) she was giving in-depth details of the pack's other victims.  The one's <br />
acting the question were two of the cops from the group of twelve who didn't look the <br />
other way from the game. One was a round man with glasses, the other was a fairly well <br />
built man scars around his neck and hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shadows?&quot; The round one (Berry) asked curiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're basically empty shells now that act as Jess and Bart's arms and legs outside of the <br />
estate. They were actually changed by a Dare rather than a Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scarred one (Ben) asked, &quot;Are they sealed like you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So just the wolves have forms that are sealed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the deer can't speak to anyone but other deer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Said another of the twelve officers, this one an African named Gary sticking his <br />
head down the hallway. &quot;How's it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's singing like a bird almost. It seems that transform Bobbi said Mrs. Hardy used on <br />
her really undid nearly any brainwashing she had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley hugged herself at the discussion, 'I, I'm glade I can think clearly again but... I'm <br />
also glade I didn't stop loving Master or stop loving the pack... ' Ashley thought of being <br />
stripped of those emotions and the feeling at the conception was absolutely horrid. Ashley <br />
didn't care if it was part of the brainwashing or not, she didn't care if she used to be <br />
human and male or not. They were her -pack-, she couldn't just leave them. And she <br />
didn't want to lose the emotions she felt for them either.  &quot;Please don't talk like I'm not <br />
here sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cops looked at each other, knowing the girl was ultimately just a victim of the curse <br />
and from the sound of it, so was her Master. People doing each other in by the curse <br />
wasn't really that uncommon, but having the two then WORK TOGETHER was completely <br />
unheard of, most just figured out a way to get the victim to give the curse harmlessly back <br />
to them, having a -partner- someone who the turn holder TRUSTED was completely <br />
unheard of. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Berry said rather unsure of how to deal with this, the girl had been under the <br />
influence of the curse from all accounts, so what she did she didn't do of her own choices, <br />
but of course the police didn't officially 'recognize' the curse's existence... leaving a lot of <br />
people effectively getting away with murder (as the special wing in the Glendale art gallery <br />
would bear witness to). <br />
<br />
&quot;Bobbi says that the Hardys who wanted to speak with us in private this evening are here <br />
at the station with her. Apparently when... their house was attacked... &quot; Gary shifted eyes <br />
at Ashley for a second, who was feeling the feel weight of her own actions, curse or not. <br />
And that of her pack of course, they were pack, what one of them did reflected onto all of <br />
them. She was just glade they hadn't succeeded in killing any of the lions. &quot;They all <br />
decided it was best if we meet here at the station, the rest of our 'club of superstitious <br />
deviants who are freaks of nature immune to Sunnydale Syndrome' are here too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You.. going to be alright?&quot; Asked Berry to Ashley.<br />
<br />
Ashley looked around, no mirror or reflective surface in sight. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry she's not going anywhere.&quot; Ben said calmly. <br />
<br />
The twelve cops including Bobbi were in one of the rooms set aside for visitors or <br />
meetings. Including the one Frank and Daryl were supposed to attend regarding how to <br />
deal with encounters with the curse. <br />
<br />
Mary sat in a corner with Lance her furry rear on a fold out chair her tail swishing behind <br />
her. <br />
<br />
Brian and Felicity stood naked and furry in front of the cops with straight faces with <br />
looked back at them with equally straight faces. Of course Bobbi did the talking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, as ya all know, da curse of Glendale is very real. And we've a good deal of us have <br />
lost some good friends because of it. I have two partners that were very good friends <br />
permanent residence of  the Glendale Art Gallery that I all visit every Saturday.... so far it's <br />
always been some petty teen or old man using the curse to make someone they didn't like <br />
miserable or some horny punk trying to be king of his neighborhood surrounded by living <br />
sex dolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, the game is no longer just a game anymore. We've got a couple of idiots who <br />
turned themselves into the Big Bad Wolf from the fairy tales or werewolves from the horror <br />
movies take your pick which. Who have turned themselves and everyone at the Smith <br />
estate and FRANK and DARYL into wolf women along with Frank's family! Apparently <br />
they've become a cultish commune with a rather unpleasant way of collecting members. <br />
Some of them were given -super-powers- when they were cursed. They're all also blindly <br />
loyal to their new 'master.' However, old Uncle Scotts apparently finally stumbled on a way <br />
to ERASE the turn in someone rather than it just being wasted when someone tried to use <br />
it outside of Glendale like the police department tried to do a week before Black Tuesday <br />
back in the twenties to try and end the curse that way!&quot;<br />
<br />
There were actually a few cheers at this news, some were less optimistic about the cure <br />
actually working. There had been snake oil salesmen who claimed their absurd <br />
concoctions worked before as protection. <br />
<br />
&quot;And everyone says Alchemy is a bunch of baloney!&quot;  Said a lanky officer triumphantly with <br />
black hair named Pen. <br />
<br />
Bobbi said nothing on that subject and moved on, &quot;Sadly, since Chief Gill-head's -official- <br />
stance on the curse is that it -doesn't exist- as handed down by the city hall tourist <br />
bureau, the only thing we can get on any of them is unlawful breaking and entering, <br />
assault and attempted battery, and attempted kidnapping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only?&quot; Berry asked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Smiths we're talking about, weather they're furry or not. They're not likely to <br />
come quietly. And BEING wolves, they'll fight to the death. However, they're still all just <br />
innocent people enslaved by the curse. Even their ring leader.  Human beings simply can't <br />
stand up to them without using lethal force, we don't even know how much tranquilizer <br />
we'd need to subdue one, and if they'd still be able to rip off someone's head while they're <br />
getting drowsy, it's not like in the video games where it's instantaneous after all. And <br />
that's if we DON'T accidently kill them with an overdoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we to do?&quot; Gary asked simply. <br />
<br />
Bobbi said, &quot;You, me, everyone here, if you want you can leave right now, seriously I <br />
would if I wasn't in the position I'm all in, are gonna have to have their DNA screwed over <br />
to become something that can stand up and non-leathally subdue the wolf monsters so <br />
we can use the game to reverse their brainwashing... the buggers used the game to make <br />
themselves permanent wolf people by the way, and gave some of their members the power <br />
to change people instantly WITHOUT the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the police in the room shuddered. <br />
<br />
Bobbi said, &quot;Now believe it or not, the Hardys weren't always lion people, apparently part <br />
of the game they chose to make themselves on the fly able to defend themselves from the <br />
wolves included their pasts changing so they wouldn't have to resize their house or get <br />
their photo IDs redone.... And Mr. Hardy still has his turn.&quot; <br />
<br />
The police present were all surprised to learn that Glendale's family of cats were in fact <br />
victims of the curse. It was rather chilling to remember how much power over reality the <br />
curse -really- had. <br />
<br />
Gary sighed, &quot;Let's do this, to protect and serve and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't so TOO hasty.&quot; Felicity said, &quot;You haven't heard the 'best part.' Lions function in <br />
groups of six females to one male. And with Brian that means there's room for only one <br />
more male ... If not, your new brain chemistry is going to be too busy trying to figure out <br />
way to out pose each other.&quot; <br />
<br />
Berry asked raising his hand, &quot;Weren't you the people in the chief's office talking about <br />
killing someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be silly!&quot; Felicity said laughing, &quot;That was all just for show! We tried to play 'good <br />
cop/bad cop' with Ashley when we first captured here, I guess someone people would <br />
forget about it being a performance and just assume it wasn't a performance.  Our <br />
Transform and Dare said for us to be -civilized- we can't be civilized if we murder <br />
someone in cold blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the cops shouted from the back of the group, &quot;The Romans and Greeks were <br />
civilized! Don't forget that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of being shocked, worried, or angry at the reminder Felicity only nodded, &quot;Don't <br />
worry, we won't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian didn't mind Felicity doing most of the talking while he stood over her in her shadow: <br />
the lioness did the leg work while the male protected her and their pride with his life after <br />
all.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can all guess what happens next,&quot; Bobbi says, &quot;If you want to leave right now, <br />
please go ahead, otherwise, get ready for a sex and species change followed by a mission <br />
to subdue a bunch of brainwashed commune cultists with no way of going back to your <br />
old lives once it's over and afterward the game dies, poof, gone, no more, nada, bye-bye, <br />
NO MORE! EVER! The misery ends. What do you all say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ten of the cops stood up, Gary kicked Berry who then stood up as well. Then they all <br />
stepped foreword. <br />
 <br />
Gary repeated, &quot;To protect and serve, do it quick before the herd mentality wears off and <br />
we all realize how utterly and completely INSANE we're all being turning ourselves into <br />
freaks, uh, sorry kiddo, didn't mean it, I swear.&quot; Said Gary quickly looking at Mary. <br />
<br />
Bobbi said, &quot;Okay then, we do this in group of five since that's the max number of victims <br />
at once. You're all free to chicken out after you see your buddies get warped and what not <br />
before it's your turn. You'll all wait one minute so you'll be effected by both sides of the <br />
curse.&quot; <br />
<br />
The cops all just nodded. <br />
<br />
Bobbi looked at Brian, &quot;Do it and burn your bridge behind you big guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian nodded, and not feeling proud or excited about the size of his pride about to be <br />
increase in the least, he glanced at Mary which steeled him considerably and said to the <br />
first five police men, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
A minute of silence and then, &quot;Your Transform and Dare thus: you shall become civilized <br />
humanoid lions with the gender ratio being what will enable everyone in this room to and <br />
will act as a pride and as a team. You will be able to stand up against Big Bad Wolves in <br />
combat and be able to non-leathal disable them. You will not use the game on unwilling <br />
people unless it's to transform them back from a previous effect of the game or to undo <br />
their brainwashing. You are civilized humanoid, were always humanoid lions, shall always <br />
be humanoid lions, no transformation may change this.  Your pasts will change so to <br />
reflect your new forms so you won't have to readjust your lives from scratch and the law <br />
and the people will treat you fairly.  Any person who -truly- loves you for -you- and who <br />
you -truly- love for themselves, who meets these two conditions will become a civilized <br />
lion person similar but NOT alike to you with their existences adjusting for this, this <br />
chance will occur once you've interacted with them. Basically someone who'd love you <br />
anyway and who'd you'd love anyway but not either/or, it has to be both.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cops never flinched. But then their clothes vanished. In their place was their badge on <br />
a -very- well base piece of cord around their necks and their 'utility belt' hanging around <br />
their waists. This didn't last as blackish gold, yellowish beige, beige/brown, dark gold, and <br />
white with gold highlights fur covered their bodies. Of course all their hair fell out and <br />
vanished. Their toe and finger nails became claws that retracted into their fingers. Their <br />
manhood for a moment became covered in a sheath, then it vanished and inverted <br />
become that of a lioness. Their furry chests expanded. Then the muscles came, and lots of <br />
it as they grew in height, become limber and agile. <br />
<br />
Their heads warped into anything but human, only the look of reason and intellect <br />
separated them from mundane beasts. The round ears and muzzles relocated themselves <br />
as their teeth filled with fangs and their senses jumped several times in sensitivity. <br />
<br />
'Dang.' One lioness thought who had been a straight male a second ago, 'Mr. Hardy's <br />
mane sure is sexy.' <br />
<br />
The tails grew of their spines, becoming just another limb. Their muscles rearranged <br />
themselves as did their legs as the leather padding as good as any shoe grew on their <br />
paws and hands. <br />
<br />
The new lionesses shook their heads and stood at attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the club girls.&quot; Bobbi said simply, &quot;So what do you do that you do?&quot; <br />
<br />
They said together boldly, &quot;We chose to protect the innocent, to serve the public trust, to <br />
uphold the law. As is our duty and choice. We look out for our fellow officers, our friends <br />
and family and our pride mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Berry asked, &quot;Why are you all naked?&quot; <br />
<br />
One put her hand on her hip and turned around on one paw and said simply, &quot;Cause you <br />
try walking around with a built in fur suit in this kinda weather, duh.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Right Penny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone chickening out?&quot;  Bobbi asked. <br />
<br />
No one vacated. &quot;Then let's continue. Penny, you're up next.&quot; <br />
<br />
The process continued, until there was one cub, twelve lionesses, and two male lions in <br />
the room. <br />
<br />
Bobbie smiled and looked down at herself, &quot;Well, what do you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bernie did a quadruple back flip and grabbed into a handle bar behind her with one hand <br />
standing up straight upside down flexing her body. Her body moved with reflexes and <br />
agility that would have made any Olympian envious. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about you sisters! But I don't mind I'm gonna -keep- this body! It's new and <br />
improved over the original and I can't say I'm all that bad looking either!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're looking for a furry or a hot night at the zoo you mean!&quot; Penny taunted playfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be so melodramatic sis', you weren't paying attention much to the wording of the <br />
Transform and Dare and you wanna talk to me about not thinking about things? Pst. If I <br />
find a guy whose in love with me and I love him he get upgraded to family! Well,&quot; She <br />
grinned, &quot;Maybe not -actual- family mind you.&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;You make it sound as if humans were inferior....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NAW! It's not like that, not really.  It's not very civilized to be prejudice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you say 'upgrade?'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seen the size on our 'Lion King' Brian? Ha ha!&quot; She said 'Lion King' in a over the top <br />
manner stressing she was just having fun.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the office door. <br />
<br />
Gill sighed, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary came in with Lance at her side,   &quot;Mommy and daddy wants to know how, when this <br />
is all over, when they can apply to join the police academy and eventually become police <br />
like their pride mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Mary?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still wanna be a vet when I grow up!&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity said changing the subject, &quot;I'll get some of the cure whipped up that kills the <br />
game within the hosts. Yes we found one Gill, we really did.  We should hand it off to the <br />
pride members in case worst comes to worst and use it on the wolves they end up facing -<br />
before- removing their brainwashing. Otherwise we could end up with a bunch of lion <br />
people lawn jockeys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary meanwhile with her parents thinking about their new future Mary wondered about <br />
hers. She had to find out if her friends had been changed with her, or weather she had -<br />
new- friends at her school.... SCHOOL! &quot;Uh-ho... I think mommy forgot to call and say I <br />
wasn't gonna be there today...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Wolves were organizing everything for their departure and as some were seeing, -retreat-<br />
. True, predator retreated all the time in nature, but Big Bad Wolves in the fairytales never <br />
gave up till the end, and this reflected in the smoldering attitude of members of the pack <br />
in particular Nicole. <br />
<br />
Megan had something else on her mind though that had her blood boiling. With Master <br />
out of sight and out of sound she got the attention of some of the nearby she-wolves who <br />
were going through their personal effects that hadn't been sold for the greater good of <br />
the pack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pack-sisters! I have something important we need to do, and I'd like you all to help me do <br />
it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jasmine wondered, &quot;What do you want to do Megan?&quot; The former male movie buff asked <br />
confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Before we leave Glendale and start our new lives,&quot; Megan said calmly and focused,, <br />
&quot;Before we leave the estate and all it's comforts behind. Before we relocate to the island to <br />
preserves our species...&quot; Megan then spoke in a much less pleasant and even tone, &quot;I'm <br />
going to see that mangy cat joins it's partner in kitty heaven and I'm going to rip apart it's <br />
broken body and eat it's still warm body piece by piece!&quot;<br />
<br />
'Little brother, I should have been there, I'll make it all up to you right now.'<br />
<br />
Megan then saw Abbey come into the room holding some blankets that hadn't been sold <br />
off yet. &quot;Abbey... &quot; Megan said sweetly, &quot;There's something very important that we're going <br />
to need your help with doing... it's very special and a surprise for Master... it's gonna <br />
rescue Ashley and stop the bad guys from hurting our family. Think you can help us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey confused and befuddled by the smiling she wolf down at her meekly nodded, &quot;Good <br />
dear.&quot; Megan rubbed her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmine, Margot, Anne, Beatrice, Zack, Terri, Sandi, are you with me? Oh and Zack, that's <br />
a rhetorical question for you, you're to obey all female commands remembers? Good. <br />
We're getting Ashley back -now.-&quot;</p>
