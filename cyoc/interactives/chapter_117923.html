<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Originally, I had your human form having black hair.  Now it's blond.  I'm keeping it blond because of a pretty dumb reason.  I base many characters I make on combinations of my own personal feelings, characters from shows I watch, characters from movies, and many other things.  For some reason, I imagine the human form of Gannoth being similar to Sting Eucliffe from Fairy Tail.  Why?  I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway, your hair is similar to his.  Also, Rowan's actions are somewhat based on Zeref, another character from Fairy Tail.  There's much more than just Fairy Tail influences in this.  There's D&D, Game of Thrones, the current political landscape of America, and more!  I'm a mess!<br/>
<br/>
Also, it might be some time before I write again.  I need time to brainstorm more ideas.  If you'd like to add on, feel free to do so!  I'm open to new ideas for the story!  Thank you for reading! - Llamas2000</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the chapter choice implies, the beginning of this chapter will be from Rowan&#39;s perspective.  &#39;You&#39; will be referring to Rowan until I indicate otherwise.  Aside from that, enjoy this chapter!<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;MASTER!&quot;  You heard shouted directly into your ear.  The next thing you knew, Gannoth dove into you, knocking you to the ground.  You watched in horror as your familiar was stuck by a dark-purple colored bolt of lightning.  Your familiar just saved you from getting hit by that, despite knowing that you would have probably been fine.  You could see that he was in unbearable pain, before being knocked unconscious.  Immediately, you ran to him, trying to see if he was okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth?&quot;  You asked worriedly.  &quot;Are you okay?&quot;  Silence came from your loyal familiar.  &quot;Gannoth?  Please!  Speak to me!&quot;  Still nothing from the limp body of him.  &quot;You can&#39;t die!  It&#39;s the only way both of us can!  YOU CAN&#39;T!&quot;  At this point, you were crying in the middle of the market, with no idea of how to handle yourself.  Lucien and Marcelle were playing crowd control, just pushing people back.  You were sobbing uncontrollably at this point.  &quot;IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO CAN HEAL?&quot;  You yelled into the crowd.  Silence was the only answer you received.  &quot;Healing.  The one magic that has eluded me for so long.&quot;  You cried, holding the nearly lifeless body of your familiar you&#39;d only known for a short time.<br />
<br />
&quot;My King.  We should probably go back to the castle.&quot;  Lucien suggested.  &quot;It might be easier to deal with this there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  You barely mustered through the tears.   You summoned your wings and quickly flew to your castle, making sure Gannoth was held safely in your arms.  When you made it, you set him on your bed, and just cried.  &quot;If only I could heal you.  If only I could save you!&quot;  You cried, overlooking the motionless body of Gannoth.  After a couple of minutes of desperately trying to use any kind of magic you could to heal him, you felt pain in your soul.  You knew that this meant he was dying.  The pain quickly intensified, and spread throughout your whole body.  You collapsed onto the floor, writhing in pain.  Yet, as soon as it spread, it stopped.  You opened your eyes and saw nothing but white.  &quot;Where am I?&quot;  You asked yourself.  Everything was a vast, white nothingness.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are in your bedroom Rowan.&quot;  You heard.  It was your own voice speaking.  A manifestation of your own body appeared in front of you.  However, rather than wearing your usual purple outfit, he was wearing pure white robes.  His hair was long and blond.  He looked almost angelic.  &quot;You may be wondering who I am.  Well, I am you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  You asked.  &quot;Is Falcour taking over my mind again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Rowan.&quot;  He laughed.  &quot;I am part of your soul.  Although you are the reincarnation of Falcour&#39;s soul, with part of it being in you, I am the part of your soul that is you.  When the Angel came to your parents and tried to stop your birth, he unknowingly gave some of his power to you.  This power has been welling inside of you for all of these years.  This is why you are not a psychopath like Falcour was.  This is why you are not the evil that he once was.  This is why you will transcend into Godhood.  This small accident will cause you to be a force for Good and Evil.  Order and Chaos.  Everything and Nothing.  This ordeal that you are going through right now, this tragedy you are facing, is just one part of your ascension into Godhood.  As the Archdemon stated, putting that ring on unlocked more than demonic power in your body and mind.  Your divine power, the power of Gods, Angels, and Good, was also unlocked.  Yet it was beaten by the power of the Demons.  Now, with this tragedy underway, you must find your divine power and heal your familiar.  This is a test of your drive, your power, and your compassion.  Find this power, and you will live on.&quot;  With that final piece, the manifestation disappeared, leaving you alone in the emptiness.  You didn&#39;t know what to do.  You tried magic, but nothing seemed to work.  Everywhere you looked, it looked the same.  Rather than look around, you thought to meditate.  To find yourself, you need to look within yourself.  You sat down, crossed your legs, closed your eyes, and cleared your mind.  In your mind, you saw just one thing.  A small spark of light.  You reached toward it, feeling its power.  It felt comforting and pure.  This was the divine power you sought.  When you opened your eyes again, you saw the familiar sight of your bedroom.  Gannoth was still lying motionless of your bed.  You stood up, put your hands on his head and chest, and tried to tap into this new, pure energy.  Your hands glowed white, and you could feel his temperature rise.  The cold, lifeless body of your familiar was gaining life once again.  You cried as you saw Gannoth&#39;s arms twitching.  You successfully healed your familiar.  You let him rest as you cried tears of joy.  Not only did you save Gannoth&#39;s and your lives, you completed another step towards reaching your ultimate destiny.<br />
<br />
As Gannoth layed on your bed resting, you wanted to wash your face of the tears.  You went to the bathroom, where you magically sprayed some water on your youthful face.  This is when you noticed your hair.  It was the same as the manifestation.  Long, soft blond hair.  You also noticed your demonic fangs and ear points were gone.  You&#39;ve entered a divine form.  You were even surrounded by a faint, white aura.  This made you very happy.  &quot;Very good, Lord Tyrell.&quot;  A familiar voice said.  You turned and noticed Archdemon Zebulon standing next to you.  &quot;I sent that bolt towards you.  I knew one of two things would happen.  Either you&#39;d be hit, or your familiar would.  Both would unlock your power further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;  You stated.  &quot;It caused quite a panic in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  This was the only way to unlock your power.&quot;  Zebulon stated.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had to do this, but it was the only way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;I feel almost angelic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Zebulon agreed.  &quot;This aura you have is making me feel odd.  But, I know one thing.  Just as your familiar, you now have alternate forms.  This one, and your demonic form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot;  You stated, changing back into your demonic form, noticing the fangs and ear points.  &quot;Feel better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  Zebulon laughed.  &quot;Depending on the needs of the time, you have these two forms.  Think of this one as power, and the other as soul.  This is damage, might, death, and power.  The other is healing, good, calm, and peace.  Use both wisely.  Your Godly ascension will come shortly at this rate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can&#39;t thank anyone but you, Your Grace.&quot;  You smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  It&#39;s your familiar who put you on this journey.&quot;  Zebulon laughed.  &quot;He changed you.&quot;  Then, Zebulon disappeared.  You smiled as you sat down on your bed and waited for your familiar to awaken.<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
(Back to Gannoth&#39;s perspective.  AKA, normality)<br />
<br />
Just as soon as you were knocked out, you awoke once again.  Your vision was blurry, but you could see the vague form of your Master.  &quot;Master?  What happened?&quot;  You asked feebly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Archdemon decided to test me.&quot;  Rowan answered, running his hand through your short, spiky blond hair.  &quot;And you had to suffer because of it.  I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Master!  I feel great now!&quot;  You smiled.  You weren&#39;t lying.  Within seconds of your vision coming back, you felt a brief power surge.  &quot;I think I might have transcended into the same kind of immortality as you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I too, have changed.&quot;  Rowan switched to his divine form, and left you in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master?  What happened?&quot;  You asked, confused why Rowan&#39;s hair became blond and a white aura surrounded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;My divine powers have awoken.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;In this form, I can use them.  This is how I healed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then!  That&#39;s good news!&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;How long was I out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Rowan answered.  &quot;It&#39;s morning now though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then pretty long.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;I think I want to finish that shopping trip.  Even if I don&#39;t need to eat, I still want to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s get Marcelle and Lucien and go to the market.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  Even if it was terrifying in the beginning, this ordeal helped you and Rowan grow further.  Godhood never seemed closer.  But for now, food was on the mind.<br />
