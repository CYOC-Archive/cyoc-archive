<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dianna took a short look at Jenny, who was in the middle of flattery, and decided that maybe she could find retribution in her. In any case, it wasn&#39;t too complicated to write around and make Jenny her daughter. If it was really too much hassle, she could just reverse it with a simple sentence - instead of the probably mountains of carefully worded paragraphs required to bring back Alyssa and her daughter - probably not even in an optimal condition. Though it&#39;d just make sense to write &quot;I want my old life&quot; onto the page, it was completely possible that she was last thursday&#39;d into existence and &quot;old life&quot; can mean literally anything within the bounds of the pen. In other words, Dianna had no idea how deep she was into this thing&#39;s technicalities, so it was for the best not to mess with them. Dianna then pondered a more &quot;slash and burn&quot; approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;... don&#39;t you think so?&quot; The teen said something about stock prices.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, sorry. I was taking notes on something else.&quot; Dianna apologetically smiled &quot;You know what? What would you do if you were the head of the company?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I would totally...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny began droning on about what would happen and what kind of changes and blah. It wasn&#39;t very interesting, in fact, this job wasn&#39;t very interesting. As this was happening Jodie, a rather slender blonde whos looks betrayed her intelligence, walked in and smiled - though was caught off guard by the intern in the room. &quot;Oh, am I interrupting...&quot; <br />
<br />
Dianna, on a whim, also wrote Jodie was an eighteen year old intern coming in late for an interview. When Dianna opened her eyes, Jodie was apologizing profusely for being late. Something about her parents...<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Jodie. Take a seat.&quot; Dianna said, noticing how much worse Jodie had it now as an intern.<br />
<br />
There was a time when Dianna didn&#39;t have to worry about this kind of shit. No interviews, no shitty jobs, no living paycheck to paycheck... She looked at the girls in front of her and decided that she wanted to go back to those simpler times. Maybe not university though, that sounded like a pain to go through. Highschool, now that was easy. It was like college minus the expectations, even in the AP classes that Dianna bullshitted through... Dave never got into AP...<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh&quot; Dianna said out loud<br />
<br />
Jenny stopped her rambling &quot;What?&quot; Jenny looked anxious, Jodie looked like she wanted to say something and waited for Jenny to shut up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were kind of rambling, there.&quot; Jodie pointed out<br />
<br />
Dianna, realizing that she just interrupted the perfect diversion, quickly moved to salvage it &quot;Oh, I was just impressed with Jenny&#39;s suggestions. Uh, please, you two just try to impress me with your ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two looked at each other, confused, but Jenny was the first to take the initiative. As for Dianna, she decided she wanted to start over from the age of sixteen and was already set on building a new family.<br />
<br />
&#39;I am a sixteen year old girl of an upper-class family. Jenny and Jodie, the ones in front of me...&#39; for good measure &#39;... are both my older sisters. Our mother owns a majority in Borker...&#39;, Borker was the company Dianna was working for &#39;... and our father is an eccentric billionaire.&#39; The idea of having a father like the Great Phatsby sounded like an awesome gig. &#39;Jenny, Jodie and I are all extremely gifted in four different skills. For genetics, Jenny, Jodie and I will have our phenotypes mixed to create the genetic similarities between us. Our parents will both be randomly generated based on those phenotypes. Our parents will also be extremely interesting. Our names will all change according to our parent&#39;s preferences and cultural backgrounds, and any surprises this pen may have for us during this change must be ultimately positive for all of&#39; us. Our personalities will only change slightly.&#39;<br />
<br />
Dianna blinked and found herself  in a bathroom stall, pants down, defecating. She was no longer holding the pen and she freaked out as she thought she lost her lifeline. She had no idea where she was, or what her name was right now, so having the damn thing would be useful for ironing out the kinks. She then checked her pockets and found a heavy, golden pen in the left back pocket. As soon as she touched the pen, another sixteen years of memories and experiences flooded her head. She was Veronica Avril Travers, a self-conscious girl of French, Italian and Greek descent. She recalled her exact height to be five-foot-seven and her weight to be one-hundred and fifteen pounds with an hourglass figure. thirty two D cup chest that made Veronica feel fat before she was invaded by... Veronica. A twenty-five inch waist and thirty-six inch hips. She had also dyed her black, wavy hair purple and wore contacts to appear to have green eyes. The several life times old Veronica actually quite liked her blue eyes, but there was no point in taking out the contacts now. And despite receiving many a compliment from guys and girls alike, she always thought they were lying to be nice. There was even more detail there, but Veronica felt that it&#39;d probably be best if she didn&#39;t dwell on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Veronica! Come on, Hellen is waiting for us outside.&quot; Her sister, Cecilia - formerly Jenny - called out from behind the stall. Hellen was probably Jodie, she was the only sister left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a minute!&quot; Veronica shouted with her now much lighter voice, followed by a less grateful shitting sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jesus, I&#39;ll be outside&quot; Cecilia said, briskly vacating the bathroom.</p>
