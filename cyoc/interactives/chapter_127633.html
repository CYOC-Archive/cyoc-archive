<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the surreal experience in the bathroom Katie and Kellie found the rest of the day pass in a blur. Shocked that people actually seemed to appreciate their relationship the girls found themselves flushing with embarrassment whenever the passed through the hall. Both girls were now thankful for the free period they now had.<br />
<br />
As the entered the room Katie and Kellie noticed Mika, Claudia, Samantha, and Mary Elise waiting for them towards the back of the classroom. Their friends smiled and waved them over to join them. Taking a seat the girls smiled, finally feeling more at ease.<br />
<br />
“Glad you two finally patched things up,” Claudia said. “This place really sucked last week. You two made everything way too awkward.” Katie and Kellie apologized as Clauida smiled.<br />
<br />
“You know the worst part was I couldn’t even tell you how things are going with my aunt,” Mika whined.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah how are things with Kumiko?”<br />
<br />
Mika smiled as she began to gush about living with her aunt. Katie listened intently, comparing notes with how Mika and her aunt were compared to Katie and Lisa. As it turned out things were very similar.<br />
<br />
Mika found Kumiko to be a very fun and free spirited woman. Kumiko seemed to embrace the fact she was Mika’s guardian now. While she was strict she was fair and treated Mika respectfully. Mika appreciated this the most. Her parents were strict, which caused Mika to rebel against her parents authority. While those rebellious tendencies were nothing crazy it did cause her parents to bristle. Living with Kumiko put Mika more at ease. The girl now found herself happy and made a habit of spending every evening talking with her aunt. Katie suppressed a giggle as she heard how the two of them had even painted each others nails, remembering the experience she had with Lisa over the weekend.<br />
<br />
“That sounds great Mika,” Katie said. “I’m glad everything is working out for you so well.”<br />
<br />
Before the girls could continue they heard the teacher enter the room and close the doors. Turning the girls gaped as Ms. Walters smiled. “Students,” she said with a smile. “This is a free period. You may talk quietly or do schoolwork until the end of the period. If you need to use the restroom please take the pass located on my desk.” Ms. Walters strode over to her desk where she pulled out some papers she was grading.<br />
<br />
Kellie grinned impishly as she looked at Mary Elise. “Mary you should so go talk to Ms. Walters about the costume contest.” Mary Elise turned a little pale as she gaped at Kellie. “That’s nuts,” she hissed. “What would I even say? Hey Ms. Walters congrats on winning the contest you looked super hot.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds about right,” the girls said in unison.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise sighed as she blushed and buried her face in her hands. “Ugh me and my big mouth,” she moaned.  “Fine look I’ll go but I want Katie to come with me.”<br />
<br />
“Wait why me?!?”<br />
<br />
“Because I know your not going to say anything to embarrassing,” Mary Elise said. “Sorry but I have a feeling the rest of you would say either something goofy or stupid or embarrassing.”<br />
<br />
The girls frowned before shrugging. “She does have a point,” Samantha said. “Claudia and Mika probably would say something to embarrass you.” The two girls looked at Samantha now frowning. “Seriously Sammy,” They grumbled. “This coming from the girl that tripped up the stairs last week. How do you trip up stairs?”<br />
<br />
“So why not me,” Kellie asked. Mary Elise blushed slightly before looking at Kellie. “Kel you know your awesome but your even worse at public speaking than I am. Katie at least won’t start stammering and say something stupid.” Kellie frowned before sighing, she had to agree with Mary on this. She really wasn’t very good when it came to talking with people.<br />
<br />
“She’s right Kat,” Kellie said. “Your the least embarrassing option.”<br />
<br />
Katie sighed as she looked at Mary Elise. “Okay lets go talk to her,” she said. “Let’s just be quick though, I really don’t feel like spending the entire period talking about something I didnt even get a chance to go too.”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise and Katie now made their way to the teachers desk where the attractive dark haired woman was busily going over some of her papers. Glancing over her desk Katie could see that Ms. Walters was a closet comic book nerd. The woman had a coffee cup with Wonder Woman on it as well as a small charm bracelet with the Justice League logo on it. Smiling the two girls placed their hands on the desk. “Hey Ms. Walters,” they said.<br />
<br />
Ms. Walters turned and smiled at the the two teens. “Oh hello Mary, hello Katie,” she said warmly. “Is there something I can help you with?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise rubbed her neck as she looked at her teacher, she didn’t quite know what to say now that she was up here. Taking a deep breath Mary decided to compliment her coffee mug. “I didn’t realize you were a comic book fan,”  Mary said. Ms. Walters looked down at her mug before blushing. “Oh this,” she said shyly. “Yeah I’ve been a bit of a fan girl for awhile now.”<br />
<br />
Mary smiled feeling a little more at ease now. “Wow same here,” she said. “Love Marvel comics but I take it your more of  a D.C. fan.” Ms. Walters smiled, raising her mug. “Yep guilty as charged.”<br />
<br />
“So,um...Ms. Walters, I um, wanted to congratulate you on winning the costume contest at Comic Con a couple of weeks ago.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Walters jaw dropped as she her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. “Oh my god you were there,” she whispered. Mary Elise nodded as Ms. Walters buried her face in her hands. “Ugh who else was there ,” she moaned in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Well it was me, Sammy, Mika, Claudia, Mike Davis and Sebastian Kane.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Walters looked to the back of the class where the girls waved giving her timid smiles. Ms. Walters groaned again before smiling and waving back.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know why your embarrassed Ms. Walters,” Katie said. “From what I heard you looked great. Plus I heard first prize was $1500. You probably could do a lot with money like that.”<br />
<br />
Ms. Walters smiled as she patted Katie’s hand. “I appreciate that Katie,” she said. “The thing is it’s a little embarrassing being a grown woman, dressing up in costume. I’m starting to get a bit old for that, especially if my students are going to these things, I don’t know sometimes, well, sometimes I kind wish I could go back in time a little. Back when dressing up like a super hero wouldn’t be seen as being a super nerd.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Mary Elise smiled at their teacher who smiled back. Katie was about to add something when she saw a faint glow. Looking down she gasped, Ms. Walters had accidentally touched the ring when she said that. The ring in turn took that as a wish and now began to work its magic. “Oh shit,” Katie mumbled as she looked at Ms. Walters.</p>
