<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Now do you believe me?&#39; the boy asked<br />
<br />
&#39;You are not Aaron. I know that much. But how did this happen? Magic isn&#39;t real&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I didn&#39;t think so either. I didn&#39;t think the ring would work but it did. It changed me into Aaron&#39;s twin&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So you are really Jessie? It&#39;s hard to believe&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I am. Can I go back to my own room now? I don&#39;t like being a boy&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll just check the coast is clear&#39;<br />
<br />
Angela left the room. She could hear the basketball bouncing outside. &#39;Quick he&#39;s still outside and neither your father or Jacob are home yet&#39; Both Angela and the boy Jessie scrambled down the hall to Jessie&#39;s room, Jessie closing the door as she entered. Angela had reached the room first and had immediately picked up the ring.<br />
<br />
&#39;So how does it work?&#39; She asked the still male Jessie.<br />
<br />
&#39;The instructions essentially said &quot;Wear the ring and then if you put some clothes on it changes your body to fit the clothes&quot; When I first put Aaron&#39;s shirt on I changed to being a 10 year old male version of myself but the more of Aaron&#39;s clothes I put on the more I became Aaron&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Do you still have these instructions?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No they were on a tag. I don&#39;t recall what happened to that tag. I thought it was just a joke. I might have thrown it away&#39;<br />
<br />
Angela had by now slipped the ring onto her own finger. She had been surprised that it had slipped on. It had appeared to be too small. &#39;So if you put your own clothes back on, will you turn back into Jessie?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I assume so. I hadn&#39;t got around to trying that out yet when you caught me. These clothes were the first ones I had tried out. I may have to be wearing the ring though&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe just see if it works when you are not wearing the ring&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I guess.... What happened to my clothes?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I put them in the basket when I sent you to Aaron&#39;s room. When I thought you were Aaron I didn&#39;t want Jessie to discover what Aaron was doing&#39;<br />
<br />
Jessie went to her basket and retrieved the skirt, bra and top she had been wearing earlier in the day. She took off Aaron&#39;s shirt and put her bra back on. It was currently too big for her body. Nothing about her body changed. She looked like a 10 year old boy wearing his older sister&#39;s bra. &#39;Unless you can see a change in me I&#39;d say it doesn&#39;t work unless I am wearing the ring&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Let me try&#39; said Angela. She was wearing the ring. <br />
<br />
Jessie took the bra back off and handed it to her mother. Angela took her own shirt and bra off. She had kept her figure despite being a mother of three. The bra would fit her although the cups would be a size too small. She didn&#39;t mind that Jessie was watching her. By now she believed that this was Jessie and that the ring would work. Knowing it was Jessie in that body made Angela not shy about being naked.<br />
<br />
The bra did fit - perfectly. Angela didn&#39;t feel the change but her breasts were not squished. It wasn&#39;t until she looked in Jessie&#39;s mirror that she noticed her face has changed as well. &#39;I look younger! My wrinkles have diminished!&#39; She also observed her breasts had shrunk somewhat.<br />
<br />
&#39;You look like a younger version of yourself. I&#39;d guess you look to be mid thirties&#39; said the child Jessie &#39;If you want you should put on the rest of my clothes. I think then you would become 16. That will prove to you who I am&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh I believe you already. Seeing is believing&#39; While she was talking Angela had taken off her shoes and quickly stripped off her jeans and panties. She was eager to transform and be young again. This was unbelievable. Quickly she put on a pair of Jessie&#39;s panties, fresh panties Jessie handed to her from her drawer. She looked in the mirror and observed that her hips had narrowed slightly. She still largely had her own face but she now looked even younger - perhaps late 20&#39;s. &#39;Wow!&#39; was all she could say. Jessie had her mother&#39;s pale skin and brown hair so there were no changes there. But now Angela&#39;s eyes had changed colour, from her own brown to Jessie&#39;s hazel colour.<br />
<br />
Jessie was holding out the skirt and top she had been wearing while shopping. Angela took the skirt first and stepped into it. Immediately she looked back into the mirror. She now looked early 20&#39;s and was a hybrid of her own face and Jessie&#39;s she could easily be Jessie&#39;s older sister.<br />
<br />
Eagerly she took the lilac knitted top that Jessie was holding. She put that on and essentially became Jessie &#39;Oh wow! Just wow!&#39; she even sounded like Jessie.<br />
<br />
&#39;I guess if you put my sandals on the change will be complete&#39; Jessie explained.<br />
<br />
Angela did not hesitate. She put on the white flat sandals that Jessie had been wearing &#39;I just can&#39;t believe this! I&#39;m 16 again! This is incredible&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So what do you want to do now? You know the ring works. Would you like to stay as Jessie for the evening. If so, you had better give me the ring so I can become Mom. Let&#39;s see if we can fool the others&#39;<br />
<br />
Angela found herself giving off Jessie&#39;s distinctive giggle as she slipped the ring off her finger and handed it to the apparent Aaron.</p>
