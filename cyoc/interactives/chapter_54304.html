<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the medical wing, with no clue of the history of the witches' past or the story Marie was <br />
telling, Mother Glen asked an obvious question. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any idea what the 'some reason' why that the curse attacked you? The pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie said, &quot;It was just a matter of this being where the curse fully awakened. And we were <br />
all just good nearby converts for it to feed off of,&quot; Said Ashley, &quot;After it fully awakened, it <br />
influenced us to begin to use the game on each other almost at random. Amy was was her <br />
personal shrine at the time and wasn't effected, where that girl picked up Shinto I have no <br />
idea.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to awaken it? Do you have any idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla answered, &quot;After Amy and Zelipe ignorantly turned Yamato, Akane, Umeko, Chiyoye <br />
and Eri back from statues, Megan and Margot chose as an early birthday present to Alpha <br />
Kaylee to replace them as her souled art. They Transformed or Dared each other to become <br />
living art. Alpha Kaylee always loves basking in he presence of art with souls for some <br />
reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was NOT a good thing to say about an Alpha of a pack. If Mother Glen was any other <br />
leoman Julie and Darla would have spaded her where she stood on her four legs. <br />
<br />
The living art in the room felt also offended at the lion Matriarch's words. <br />
<br />
Julie and Darla said matter of fact in defense of their harem-mate, &quot;Yomato and his mates <br />
-willing- became art. And since the gargoyles could tell their spirits were still there, it <br />
could not be called suicide.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mother Glen looked in amazement at the japanese wolves, then at the recovering Megan <br />
and Margot. Finally she asked, &quot;Why did you willing become motionless rocks?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;In our case it was solid gold.&quot; Chiyoye said, &quot;Alpha Kaylee has always had a taste for <br />
Japanese imported entertainment and art she knew was thinking about her too. Given our <br />
heritage, and the 'condition' of myself and my harem-mates, we realized we were perfectly <br />
logical candidates to become a gallery for Alpha Kaylee for her enjoyment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never being able to move? Never being able to speak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those who stand at attention also serve.&quot; Chiyoye quoted from somewhere. <br />
<br />
Yamato spoke, &quot;After I explained in precise terms the error of what Amy-Chan and her <br />
brother had done, forcing us to end our service to Alpha Kaylee, the Alphas realized that <br />
Amy-Chan and Zelipe-chan's power could be used to rescue the wolves whose were forced <br />
by the game unwillingly into being art.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And how did the two of you, or Yamato and his mates,&quot; Mother Glen said looking at <br />
Megan and Margot, &quot;Even -get- turns to the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
The truth was that it had been simple to take the turns the shadows had and have them <br />
given harmlessly to the wolves, who simply used them on each other. However, 'Sorry <br />
Mother Glen,' Megan thought, 'I'm not telling an outsider, even you, about Bart and Jenny if <br />
I don't have to.' &quot;THAT is purely a -Pack- matter. And has nothing to do with your Pride's <br />
health or well being.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mother Glen was astounded at the look in Megan's eyes from where she lay on he medical <br />
bed, she looked ready for Mother Glen to eat her alive before saying anymore more on the <br />
subject.  &quot;I shall do the civilized thing then and not probe what does not directly relate to <br />
my Pride.&quot; She didn't ask how they had gotten to the island, 'Alice's magic trick' was <br />
relatively well known, though almost none outside the pack knew the full extent of her <br />
abilities to use ANY smooth reflective surface rather than just mirrors, her invincibility was <br />
also down played. <br />
<br />
The two leomans, the snow white Maxwell and the light beige Sonia continued to busybody <br />
around Yamato. Just as Yamato had committed a grave dishonor by crippling Penny, <br />
Maxwell and Sonia had gravely broken leoman creed by their uncivilized outburst. <br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone told you your fur looks like just Japan's flag?&quot; Sonia asked trying to come up <br />
with compliments to the man who had disabled her cub's legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Several hundred times.&quot; Yamato said simply, not taking offense or annoyance at the <br />
question, he was proud of his heritage after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you really were just -okay- with just being gold statues just for your Alpha to look at?&quot;  <br />
Maxwell said rather unbelieving. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was an honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm guessing the wolves Little Amy saved with her magic trick didn't think of being in <br />
Glendale's museum as an honor.&quot; Sonia said. <br />
<br />
&quot;None of them were given a choice. Many spent years with none knowing they were even <br />
still alive. Until the gargoyles senses revealed they still had living souls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sonia asked, &quot;Why not just transfer their essence into statues carved by a female gargoyle <br />
then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick was the one who spoke up and answered that one, he had a sister for one after all, <br />
&quot;Gargoyles in general consider using essence transfer on non-gargoyles to be obscene. <br />
Even in the most well intentioned cases. Not to mention there's the psychological side <br />
effects of the essence transfer that leaves the subject wit the base uber-territorial instincts <br />
gargoyles are known for... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That STILL had to be better than just being a prisoner in your own body!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It likely is. But it's like zoophilia to them. And even he ones who are willing won't do it on <br />
a unwilling subject, and since they can't get an answer from the victim, they refuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not from their point of view it isn't!&quot; Nick said frowning, Nicole frowned too, Backdoor was <br />
her friend and sister-in-law after all. &quot;It's like pulling a plug on a coma victim, unless they <br />
left instructions on such a thing, it could be considered -another- violation of their <br />
choices. AND since the original vessel is destroyed during the transfer, that means there <br />
would be no way for them to be what they were before if another way was found... and <br />
many had been statues for so long they didn't have family advocates to speak on their <br />
behalf... those that did... well... most clung to the 'vain' hope a better way would come <br />
around... &quot;<br />
<br />
Zack spoke, &quot;Which came in the form of my son and daughter!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxwell and Sonia looked at each other, then Sonia said to Yamato, &quot;Once upon a time, a <br />
few centuries or more so ago, it was consider unnatural for a leoman to take a Prime Mate, <br />
someone who'd -always- be first, and who would -always- have say on who their partner <br />
was with... You think being lawn jockeys for your Alpha Female to speak to and just hang <br />
around is how you'll best serve the pack, I chose not to argue... you say my cub has to be <br />
the one who has to pass judgement on you? Okay, I chose to accept answer that too.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mary breathed a sigh of relief. Jeff and Gloria were also glade they didn't have to interfere <br />
and get things even more complicated. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the middle of all this, Robyn and Maxine were flanking Millie. The three <br />
teenage wolves huddled around each other. <br />
<br />
'I have no idea why I remember that name, Miles,' Maxine thought, 'I remember, a guy <br />
named Max, a guy named Robin spelled with an 'i' and a guy named Miles. Best of buddies. <br />
I remember them being human. I should just remember how things were after becoming <br />
wolves... everyone else does... I don't have any magic powers... I don't have any magic <br />
tricks. I remember Miles coming late after we were all made female wolves and swearing <br />
our oath of loyal to Alpha Kaylee in that army helmet of hers. I remember playing cat and <br />
mouse with him before finally changing him into cute little Millie... I remember we were all <br />
adults before that... And... I know that these are things I shouldn't know, and I get the gut <br />
feeling, the universe knows I shouldn't know these things too. And without a magic trick, I <br />
have no excuse for knowing things I shouldn't know.' <br />
<br />
Millie looked at Maxine with surprise, then confusion, bewilderment, then alarm and shock. <br />
Robyn covered her orange muzzle before Millie accidently let a yelp of alarm and shock. <br />
&quot;Oh-My-God!&quot; Millie swore as for a brief moment, she remembered her previous existence <br />
as Miles in a reality that no longer existed. And if it never existed how could she even <br />
remember it? The short answer: she couldn't, and that truth hit her mind harm, all she was <br />
hearing were echoing that were fading fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miles? Millie? Maxine? Max? I'm scared.&quot; She whispered. <br />
<br />
Maxine hugged her, this game wasn't going like it was supposed to, she and Robyn were <br />
supposed to tease their packmate about being back at high-school age, none of the <br />
respect of adults and none of the free time of children. Instead, Maxine trick to remember <br />
long enough the previous existence had caused a bug, and reality, did not humor bugs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ed ain't so bad,&quot; Robyn said hugging Millie too, &quot;We're closer dan evah! We're a pack, a <br />
family. We're thicker than water.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And all of our pack mates love us, would you really want to leave them?&quot; Maxine asked.<br />
<br />
Millie thought for a moment, &quot;No, I guess I wouldn't...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dat's da spirit girl!&quot; Robyn cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you think we're gonna turn into sisters?&quot; Millie asked, not wanting any of them to <br />
use their parents or their parents to lose children, but at the same time, the feeling of even <br />
greater closeness enticed her at the back of her mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if we don't, we're sisters at heart and that's where it counts.&quot; Maxine said the two <br />
hugging her injured packmate as much as they dared. 'Hmm, looks like Millie's got a head <br />
start on me, and I'm a late bloomer, then again, I already know I'm gonna have the best <br />
figure out of all three of us when we're done! Tee-hee!!' Maxine thought amused with <br />
herself.  <br />
<br />
Millie shuddered, &quot;I don't think I can take high school again.&quot; Miles life in highschool had <br />
NOT be pleasant, his meek attitude making him a walking doormat, unlike girls who were <br />
supposed to be cute that way. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm all pretty sure we're all home school Sugah.&quot; Said Robyn nuzzling her. &quot;Well, except fer <br />
the Alphas, and those of us with degrees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Millie sighed, &quot;I don't know weather to be relieved or disappointed by that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure old Alpha will let ya go ta public school if ya all ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good, I'm kinda curious to see what it's like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh don't know why ya'd all want ta, isn't learnin' with family better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it's where the Alphas met, so maybe I'll meet my mate there too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxine said, &quot;What do we need mates for when we got each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
Robyn said, &quot;Oooh, you'll change yer tune once ya meet the right Lupman sistah, trust me <br />
on this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, fine sis', I will. What about you little sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mille sighed, &quot;Like I said, it's a good place to meet people and future mates, we aren't the <br />
only Lupmans in the world after all.&quot;   <br />
<br />
Laura and Zulema in light of the short violent react between pack and pride had huddled <br />
close to their mother, and Ingrid had inched them away to the pack mates farther away <br />
from Mother Glen, like Millie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ain't ya the cutest things evah!&quot; Robyn said to the twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Laura said while Zulema just nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything okay Millie?&quot; Ingrid's middle head asked while the other two looked at Robyn <br />
and Maxine. <br />
<br />
Millie thought about it, she could have come home with much much worse, or could have <br />
stayed split in two and there would have been an extra set of twins in the pack... but here <br />
she was with her entire life ahead of her and likely to recover fully unlike some other <br />
members of the her pack mates...  &quot;Everything is fine Ingrid. Everything is just fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is all this?&quot; A male Lupman whose fur was as black as midnight and taller than any of <br />
the others entered the room. Following three steps behind him was a seven foot tall she-<br />
wolf with reddish brown fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;ALPHA-JENSEN! ALPHA-KAYLEE!&quot; Julie and Darla said together at once at once to their <br />
mate and harem-mate. &quot;You should be resting and in bed!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We're fine Julie, Darla,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;We were just curious what the roar was and -<br />
Mother Glen-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello and greeting Alpha-Female Kaylee.&quot; The giant white lioness said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were the one roaring?&quot; Kaylee asked, few things got Mother Glen to roar and it was no <br />
laughing matter when she did. <br />
<br />
&quot;For all practical purposes I was.&quot; Mother Glen said simply. &quot;I was simply gleaning details of <br />
what happened to my pack who serve in Glendale's police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see.&quot; Kaylee said, feeling awkward no one had thought to inform the Pride Matriarch <br />
about her Pride's state. <br />
<br />
On her spot on the table, the statuette Michelle saw the mess this was becoming. 'You <br />
really should get some more sleep, you really should get some more sleep, doctor's orders, <br />
you really should get some more sleep.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should get some more sleep.&quot; Kaylee said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're right maybe we should get some more sleep.&quot; Jensen replied. &quot;But first I want an <br />
update on how my Pack is doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beta-Julie spoke first her hands together her sandy blond hair falling around her shoulders <br />
as she lowed at her mate and Alpha, &quot;Fran managed to stabilize all the pack members so <br />
we're in no danger of losing anyone. But these aren't injuries that'll just heal in the day. <br />
They'll all be looking at recovery and therapy for the foreseeable future. Not everyone heals <br />
as fast you Alpha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergeant Brian quoted holding Mary's hand, &quot;Good that war is such a horrid thing, least we <br />
grow too fond of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone could agree to that. <br />
<br />
Julie stepped close to her mate and harem-mate and gently pushed them back slightly, <br />
&quot;Forgive me my Alpha, but as the pack's doctor this is the one place I outrank you. We're <br />
crowded as is. Mother Glen has already offered the Yorks and the Glens to act as Ingrid and <br />
Joy's helpers and ---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait? Omega-Joy? Omega-Ingrid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are here Alpha!&quot; The three headed six armed wolves said in a chorus of six voices. <br />
Kaylee had always found it amusing that a pair of twins whose fur was white with a red <br />
cross would become nurses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress Amy freed us all.&quot; Said Joy's left head of what had been. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're fully ready to resume our duty and have been helping with the effort.&quot; Said Joy's <br />
middle head of what was happening. <br />
<br />
&quot;And since we're fully rested unlike the majority of the pack we'll be able to pick up the <br />
slack.&quot; And the right head said what was to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;As Jenny and Bart's mother, I would just like to say I'm sorry for what happened to you, <br />
Joy, Mdaddex, Ryan, Whitney, and Abdul. &quot; Kaylee began. <br />
<br />
Ingrid's three heads looked at each other and nodded in consensus and the middle head <br />
said. &quot;Mistress Kaylee. There is nothing to forgive.&quot; Said Ingrid's middle head. <br />
<br />
&quot;We were able to see a lot while we were Jenny's shadow. We saw into her true heart, and <br />
we understand why she did what she did. We are with our daughters again, that is all that <br />
matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And ready to serve the pack of course, and our services are very dearly needed indeed.&quot; <br />
Finished Ingrid's right head.  <br />
<br />
And all six head said on two sets of shoulders, &quot;And seriously our Alphas you should not <br />
up and about!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mother Glen figured this had to do with the 'Pack only' business mentioned before. <br />
<br />
Julie and Darla clapped their hands. Julie spoke, &quot;Please, we're crowded enough as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone who isn't helping or visiting please leave now.&quot; Said Darla. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those who are visiting please take a few more minutes and say your goodbyes for now.&quot; <br />
Julie said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alphas.&quot; The two triplets said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you please take our sister back to bed? She's exhasted. She was up all night and all <br />
morning saving the lives our of pack mates. Fran needs some rest.&quot; Darla and Julie pointed <br />
at the sleeping Fran. <br />
<br />
Kaylee and Jensen sighed and looked at each other and nodded. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It happened on the same day didn't it?&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;Marie and Goldwyn both lost <br />
their eye on the same day didn't they?&quot; <br />
<br />
The black and red dressed Marie said, &quot;Technically for Marie Cruz it was night, for Goldwyn <br />
it was day. But yes, by fate both of them lost half their sight that day and both had their <br />
vision set in stone. Marie now fully understood the true weight of the world her god father <br />
lived in. And Goldwyn, became convinced as white was white and black was black that <br />
rules were ultimately destructive and oppressive and true freedom and happiness could <br />
only be found in their utter annihilation...  When she woke up, she found out what she had <br />
dreamed was no dream... she cried until her eyes were red, she used her magic to FORCE <br />
Joella's half scale stone body body back together and back onto the pillar where she had <br />
sat graphed to it... but Princess came to her and told her... which was not a lie in the <br />
least... that Joella really was dead now... all Goldwyn had restored was an empty shell... All <br />
of this distracted from the alarm and absolute panic of losing her eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said before that Princess was just another cat.&quot; The great twenty something year old <br />
she-wolf said (she had been a statue since her nephew had been a pup after all), &quot;From <br />
how you describe her here, she was aiming to make the girls anarchists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was. But every choice the witchlings made was completely their own. All stereotypes <br />
have their origin, I'll say no more least I bring up things that are best left buried and <br />
forgotten where they belong. ... Goldwyn... still laying there with a complete but now <br />
empty statue... slowly looked Princess in the eyes. And Princess for the first time ever was <br />
for a moment actually scared of the witch she was helping mold. Goldwyn said, &quot;Then I'll <br />
just need to be even -more- powerful to pull her back from the afterlife won't I?&quot; Now <br />
Goldwyn had another person she wanted to be powerful enough to bring back the dead <br />
for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you use magic to bring back the dead?&quot; Ask Lawrence. &quot;It's important.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bring back the dead? Possible. Bring them back to life? Only a god can do that. Goldwyn <br />
figured she'd have it easier since she technically still had Joella's corpse perfectly preserved <br />
for her to inhabit when she called her back... but in that moment also, Goldwyn lost any <br />
respect she had for any law or rule. They were the -enemy-. And Lupmen were just like <br />
adults, the enemy's foot soldiers. Either to be liberated from their oppression or moved <br />
aside. When Grisele and Gita found out they were horrified. They cried too. They huddled <br />
with each other hugging one another for support over the death of their friend. They dared <br />
bring Joella's empty shell to the praying town and hide her in a shack just off the rang of <br />
Joseph's house.   After all, all three of them marched into their home, and Running Bear <br />
asked them at once knowing something was wrong what had happened. None of them said <br />
a word. Eyes red with tears and hair a mess and with black clouds over their heads, they <br />
just went to their rooms. Goldwyn hide her face... but it would only work until morning...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We should have known wolves were all bad.&quot; Said little Grisele.<br />
<br />
Gita said, &quot;Yeah, they're always the bad guys in the stories. The Big Bad Wolf, the Wolf In <br />
The Forest, the Winter Wolf... they're all monsters!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They kill Joella... they killed Joella!  LET'S MAKE'EM PAY FOR THAT!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't!&quot; Princess implored, &quot;Not yet! If you three try it, against an entire pack of Lupmen, <br />
they'll kill you. And remember! They're just slaves to rules! They need to be fixed! Just like <br />
all the adults need to be fixed! And all children need to be kept from being broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three were slightly mollified, but none of them would forget what they had lost that <br />
day. They had lost their grandmother to a thug who had wanted money. And now they had <br />
lost their friend to a wolf just because she wasn't supposed to be there...  They would <br />
remember. <br />
<br />
Betty asked astounded, &quot;She forgave her grandmother's killer who was a criminal, but <br />
couldn't forgive a Lupman who was just doing his duty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emotions are rarely logical. And the girls had begun to become more self righteous by this <br />
point as magic proved again and again to be a much simpler and more direction solution <br />
for things. ... When they saw a pair slaves, a mother and daughter sold off to different <br />
owners they had hugged not wanting to be separated. The three witchlings at once turned <br />
them into a nude obsidian statue with European features, so now they were being bought <br />
by the same owner, and would be together forever, from their point of view, that solved <br />
that problem at once. There are many stories like that. Also that night, all of them <br />
dreamed.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~<br />
<br />
A full moon shined down on the field in a starlit sky. The clearing was large and full of <br />
flowers of every type and many that only existed in fairy tales (the girls would fix that soon <br />
enough with their magic in reality). Fireflies danced about this way and that... <br />
<br />
The black haired Goldwyn had Princess on her shoulder. <br />
<br />
The three split up following the flow of fireflies, Gita and Grisele followed them to the edge <br />
of the clearing. <br />
<br />
Gita heard a hissing at the edge of the clearing and saw two red eyes stare back at her, <br />
they came closer, she heard hissing and saw the slow moving shape of a snake. But she <br />
was unafraid.  She snake slithered up to her and coiled itself up, it looked at her in passing <br />
interest. It was bigger than any snake she had seen, but somehow still looked like a <br />
youngling almost. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, my name is Gita, what's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must name me, and then, after that, you must discover my -true- name. Then you <br />
and I can be connected, and I'll be your sword to wield... I can feel it, you call to me, at the <br />
basement of your mind, I hear you, calling, calling me, so now I answer back. Find me, <br />
name me, find my real name, and I will stay at your side forever...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're... you're my familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond Gita looked sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not your familiar yet. Only once I become the medium and partner for your magic, <br />
will I be your familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond and pig tailed Grisele meanwhile followed the fireflies away from her sister by <br />
blood until they lead her to a large tree in the middle of the clearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Grisele said but she wasn't sure for whom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Said a cawing voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; She replied back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Grisele.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no name you know. And I have no name you have given me either. Tell me what the <br />
name you want to give me is, and figure out what my true name is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I supposed to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is for you to figure out.&quot; Said a mass of black feathers near the top of the tree. <br />
<br />
Grisele didn't think that made much sense. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! Who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
The three girls, and one snake and one cat, turned to see a little girl with black hair in <br />
simplistic but practical clothing. <br />
<br />
The three walked towards her, there was a river in the middle of the clearing with a stone <br />
bridge. On the other side, it seemed to be daytime. <br />
<br />
A youngish hound dog barked next to the girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi. My name is Gita.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Grisele.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Goldwyn.&quot; Said the black haired girl, in her dream she still had both eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Marie.&quot; Said the girl who looked about Goldwyn's age and she curtsied and <br />
bowed. She knelt down and scratched behind the dog's ear, &quot;And this Mutt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that your familiar?&quot; Gita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your magic friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, Mutt is just a friend.&quot;  Marie said having no clue how a friend could be 'magic.' <br />
<br />
Princess hissed at the girl.  <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! And this is Princess! Princess be nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie took one look at the black cat and felt scared... she had seen it before, somewhere <br />
before... only in her memory it was impaled on a poker. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Gita asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's... that's a black cat...those are bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No they're not! See? Princess is nice!&quot; Goldwyn held her up for the girl to look at with her <br />
two eyes. Princess calmed herself down somewhat and Marie took some hesitant steps <br />
onto the bridge and looked closer at the cat. <br />
<br />
&quot;I.. guess she is sort of pretty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see?&quot; <br />
<br />
 Marie nodded smiling. <br />
<br />
There seemed to be a lot of stone paths on Marie's side of the clearing. All put in pretty <br />
patterns of different colored stones instead of lots of flowers, and there were butterflies <br />
instead of fireflies.  There was also a humanoid stone lion with bird wings playing checkers <br />
with a clown, but that's dreams for you. <br />
<br />
Gita reached out her hand, the red snake she had picked up slithered up her leg, around <br />
her waist, and along her arm. &quot;Wanna be friends?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie barely thought of it, as one barely does in dreams, kids her own age, girls, not 'other' <br />
alter boys, friends, &quot;YOU BET!&quot; Marie reached out her hand. <br />
<br />
The little red snake opened it's mouth, and two pairs of fangs came out of it's jaws as it <br />
reared it's head back as it rested on Gita's wrist: neither Marie or Gita saw any of this this. <br />
<br />
The moment before they shook hands, the moment before the snake could bite however, a <br />
raven the size of an elephant appeared behind Marie cawing like thunder and startling the <br />
group. What was really weird was that it seemed to be wearing a mask shaped like it's own <br />
beak and face. <br />
<br />
The three witchlings fell on their rears in surprise and the snake fell off Gita's arm and <br />
Princess wailed in shock and alarm at the sight of the large large raven.  The raven's wings <br />
folded protectively around the surprised Marie and it stared daggers at the three <br />
witchlings. <br />
<br />
On two sides of the planet, three girls in the new, and one in the old, both awoke with a <br />
start.</p>
