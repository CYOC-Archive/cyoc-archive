TW: Rape</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel rubbed his nose and chewed on his lip, doing his best to ignore the smells in the teacher&#39;s break room. He cursed whoever had brought a ham sandwich that day, the smell seemed to fill the room and churn within his stomach. He had finished his classes with his other students, all he had left was an afternoon meeting with Mary Morrison about how best to transition Mina to her care for the next year, as well as finish up his reports on that day&#39;s classes. <br />
<br />
His ears twitched as another teacher opened the door and walked in to pour a cup of coffee, he could smell the teacher&#39;s aftershave, it stank, had the teacher slathered it on? Biting his lip so hard that it drew blood, Daniel rose and gathered his papers, he fired off a quick text to Mary to meet him in his small speech classroom and quickly left the break room. Outside the noises were louder, he could hear kids yelling, shouting, voices coming from all directions, it was becoming irritating! His clothes felt tighter, itchy! <br />
<br />
The bell rang signaling the release of the end of the day and suddenly he was swarmed by children, running past him, pushing past him, bumping into him at all angles. &quot;Watch it.&quot; He growled at a 2nd grader in an uncharacteristic anger before softening. &quot;Sorry, I.. I didn&#39;t mean to get angry at you.&quot; He knelt down and patted the child&#39;s head before quickly moving to his classroom and closing the door, dampening the noise. <br />
<br />
He laid out Mina&#39;s paperwork on the table and took a deep breath, he felt feverish, constricted, maybe afterwork he would go to one of those 24 hour clinics and get checked out. <br />
<br />
For some reason he could smell her before she entered the room, the scent of a woman in her early forties who tried a little to keep up appearances at work against the young perky teachers. When she opened the door Daniel gulped hard, his golden eyes fixated on her, she wore a blouse and simple black slacks, she had some wrinkles from age, but with every breath he could take in, all he could focus on was what was between her legs. &quot;I&#39;m sure glad I don&#39;t have to deal with all that when school lets out.&quot; Mary chuckled as she entered the room and sat down her paperwork. &quot;Worst we have are eight graders making out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s an experience.&quot; Daniel blinked rapidly trying to hang on to any type of thought, his hands moved under the table to his pants, without thinking he unzipped his belt buckle to relieve the pleasure, followed by his fly and stuffed a hand down his pants. His usual limp penis was painfully erect and boiling hot, hits fingers curved around it digging his nails into the soft flesh as he began to jerk his hips at the smell of the woman in the room. &quot;Lets talk about... about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Mary rose from her seat, fear was suddenly filled with disgust as she saw him masturbating with his hand, she could hear pops and groans coming from him as she backed away from the table and toward the door. &quot;T-This is... I&#39;m getting the nurse.&quot; Was all she could say. She turned and fumbled for the door handle only to hear the table flip over and a sudden weight press against her back. Mary screamed as sudden sharp claws ripped down the blouse on her back, snapping her bra. She threw her head back, hitting what she quickly discovered was the snout of the beast that had been Daniel. It was only a short victory as the beast growled in anger and bit her on the neck, using his paws to force her onto all fours.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP!&quot; She sobbed and reached for the door, feeling the beast sniff at her butt and then began to lick and claw at her pants. Deep inside her she knew her pleas were useless, the teachers would be gathering in the break room right now to talk about the work day and destress, and she was trapped in a room across the school. Her hand reached for the door handle, barely touching the metal, only to notice that her fingernails were chipping away to reveal black claws underneath. She had no time to process the shock as a loud rip filled the room and the beast was on her back again, this time something boiling hot was prodding against her panties, she should feel disgusted, horrified, terrified, yet she was beginning to spread her thighs little by little for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel..&quot; She begged, her face crunched and began to push out, blood filled her mouth as she could feel her teeth sharpen, her claws dug into the carpet as she readied for him to penetrate her. &quot;Daniel do it.&quot; She turned to face him, licking his muzzle with her longer tongue. She could feel something new move between her butt and instinctively she raised it for her mate, brushing her new tail up across his stomach. <br />
<br />
Daniel took in a deep breath and pushed inward, feeling the waiting folds of the bitch beneath him welcome his shaft and massage it for all of it&#39;s worth. He bent his head down and bit her on the neck to hold her as he began to thrust, his entire world was centered around the two of them at that moment as he gripped her stomach and plunged in deeper and deeper, any human thought, concern, or frailty was lost in the sexual haze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deeper, Deeper!&quot; Mary moaned, she was somewhat aware they were still in a school, and as such she placed her paw in her muzzle, biting down as her vagina was stretched beyond it&#39;s limit to accommodate the now knot at the end of Daniel&#39;s shaft, locking the two together.  It had been so long since she had been laid, even longer since she had been filled so deeply, now she wanted completion, she wanted to get every ounce of his cum inside of her. She could fill his canine dick tremble inside of her, and she bit down even harder onto her paw, howling into it as he erupted, filling her body with warmth.<br />
<br />
Two hours later the two remained together on the floor, Daniel&#39;s knot had deflated but the changes remained. They could still hear the teachers move about the school, but the sounds were getting more and more distant as more teachers locked their classrooms and went home for the day. &quot;So how did this happen?&quot; Mary asked, a paw running down her large furry breasts to explore the smaller nipples below. &quot;Were you bitten by a strange dog or..&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel rubbed his eyes and then slowly in a human way before bringing his paw down his muzzle. &quot;My student, Mina, she scratched and licked me earlier today.&quot; He paused and then held a paw up. &quot;It&#39;s not what you think! She has attachment issues.&quot; He paused and thought back at how clingy and close Mina had become through the years, and how as she had grown up she had become even more and more attached and jealous of him spending time with other students. <br />
<br />
Mary growled slightly and licked his nose. &quot;So does that mean our Alpha is an eleven year old child? Because screw that.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
Daniel shook his head and with as little grace as a wolf rolled ontop of his bitch and licked her. &quot;Let me deal with her tomorrow.&quot; He whispered, reaching a hand to grope her now firm breasts. &quot;For tonight I want to hear you howl.&quot;</p>
