<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a normal morning on the family farm, the ten-year-old Cody groggily getting out of bed at 5:30, not bothering to take a bath or eat breakfast, instead just donning a windbreaker and heading straight outside. Everyday he’d do the same song-and-dance, grabbing a few bales of hay from the farm, portioning it out between stalls before checking the animal’s water afterwards. The process alone would take two whole hours, the boy traveling to the barn a dozen times and back to fetch more hay and divvy it up between the cows, goats, horses… and… unicorn?<br />
<br />
“Huh?!!”<br />
<br />
Cody stood in utter shock as he caught sight of something in the last stall, usually empty stall. A white horse whose hide glowed with an ethereal splendor, the creature tall and somewhat lanky compared to the other horses, alike to a fantasy elf among humans. Its head peered over the stall unassumingly, but those deep eyes possessed a clear intelligence that the other animals lacked, the horn perched atop its head giving away what it was. It was an honest-to-God unicorn!<br />
<br />
The mythical beast churred amusedly at Cody, its muzzle gracefully dipping down towards the shocked boy to scoop up a mouthful of hay from his trembling arms. As it chewed the wonder-struck boy lifted a shaky hand to stroke along its muzzle, testing if the creature before him was actually real.<br />
<br />
“You are real…” The boy whispered, his hand stroking along its equine cheek. The unicorn’s fur was softer than appaloosa hide, its smell bestial but cleanly so, setting its regal nature apart from the other common farm animals in the barn. The unicorn calmy swallowed the mouthful of hay, nodding and opening her mouth, this time to speak.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I am real.” The mellifluous voice of a young woman giggled through her snout. “Don’t worry, you’re still sane! Aura is the name, human.”<br />
<br />
It was nice to hear from the horse’s mouth that he wasn’t going crazy, but it didn’t leave Cody any less dumb founded at what he was seeing. The unicorn took another bite of hay from the boy’s arms as he tried to wrap his young mind around the magic horse that suddenly appeared overnight in the stall, a question finally stuttering out.<br />
<br />
“W-why…?” Cody asked, as if simultaneously asking why she could be real, why Aura had suddenly show up out-of-the-blue locked inside a stall on his family’s farm of all places.<br />
<br />
“’cause.” She replied shortly as she chewed her hay, falling silent as if she answered his question.<br />
<br />
Left in suspense, Cody asked again. “’c-cause?”<br />
<br />
She nodded her noble head, peering at Cody’s face again as she realized he needed more of an explanation.<br />
<br />
“A holiday.” She elaborated, “A forest guardian needs her rest from time to time. It’s been, gosh, a few thousand years since my last vacation. This is where animals go to get taken care of  - like a spa, am I not mistaken?”<br />
<br />
Cody tilts his head like a confused puppy, replying, “B-but this is a farm-“ He paused, thinking it over again. In a way, she was right. Animals had all their needs taken care of here, allowed to spend their days idle in their little enclosures… but he’d never call it a spa!<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, human boy.” Aura dipped her head down, poking Cody with his nose to get his attention. “Among the many horses here… there are males; stallions?”<br />
<br />
Cody might have been a bit too young to grasp what she was getting at, the boy nodding his head… then shaking it. “I mean… there are boy horses, but they’re all geldings – so not really stallions.”<br />
<br />
The answer made the unicorn heft out a saddened snort. “Oh dear…” she sighed, looking down towards Cody, turning her head so she could get a full view of him with her herbivore eye, regarding him… differently than before. She shook her head again, letting out another frustrated chuff. “No… you won’t do either. Maybe this isn’t the right place after all…”<br />
<br />
“Do what?” Cody asked, viscerally feeling her disappointment as she turned away, walking back into her stall. Now that Aura had magically appeared on the farm, he didn’t want to see her up and leave like nothing ever happened! He stood on his tiptoes calling back to her over the stall door, “I can do lots of things! Are you hungry… hurt, sick? I can… maybe help with that, but… well… there’s a lot of stuff my mom and dad only let my older brother do…”<br />
<br />
Jason. Whatever it was, his seventeen-year-old brother could help. He knew how to drive the tractor and deal with all sorts of stuff about horses. Plus, imagine the look on his face when his little brother showed him a unicorn for the first time in his whole life! Jason had to see Aura, and surely, he’d be able to help her with whatever problem she was having. Cody raced off towards the cow barn to find his older brother, dragging him back to the horse stalls with him.<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong? What’s this about?” Jason sighed, chewing on a stock of wheat as Cody clutched his hand, ferrying him through the stables back towards the stall that held Aura.<br />
<br />
Clearly Cody was excited, but he knew his brother wouldn’t believe a word he said if he flat out claimed the farm suddenly got a unicorn overnight. “Just trust me, it’s something you’re really gonna wanna see!”<br />
<br />
“Mhm.” Jason mumbled skeptically, ready for his little brother to show him something stupid. “Better not waste my time.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t!” Cody guaranteed Jason, the two finally arriving at Aura’s stall as the younger boy banged on the gate, trying to summon the unicorn to them. “Aura! Come her girl, come meet Jason!”<br />
<br />
Jason shot a frustrated scowl towards his younger brother as the regal white unicorn trot up the stall door, lifting her head over the top to get a full view of Jason - appraising him. Of course, this human boy looked much older than Cody, years of farm labor had developed his musculature into that of a chiseled young lad with jet black hair. Much better.<br />
<br />
“Cody, what the fuck are you on about?” Jason cursed at the boy, looking over the stall to check if the horse was hurt or anything. “This is Snowflake, are you actually crazy?”<br />
<br />
“Wait… what?” Cody double-took, checking again to make sure this was the mythical beast he’d just met earlier. Yup – still a unicorn. Jason must be going blind.<br />
<br />
“No, you are! Don’t you see the horn, she’s a unicorn named Aura that just got here today!” Cody started to shake, shouting back at his older brother, trying to defend himself from being called a liar.<br />
<br />
“If this is some sort of prank, it’s weak as fuck.” Jason scoffed, reaching up to the animal’s mane as the mare nuzzling her head against his shoulder. “This is Snowflake, idiot, we’ve had her for years, and look – Wow – no fucking horn. Normal horse. Unicorns aren’t real, dumbass.”<br />
<br />
Cody glared at him as if his eyes were about to pop out of his head. The horn was right where his brother said it wasn’t! It was impossible not to see! “The horn is right there, Jason! Go on! Touch it!”<br />
<br />
Cody reached for Jason’s hand to force it to grip the unicorn’s ebony horn, but as the boy finally got a hold of the other boy’s hand… it felt… different.<br />
<br />
Cody’s exasperation shifted to shock as he felt Jason’s hand in his. Well, it wasn’t exactly a hand. His fingers weren’t exactly there anymore, a huge, mass of keratin seemed to have enveloped his whole fist. Cody ran his finger across the smooth surface as it bulked out, forming a broad, concave edge as the it suddenly expanded, getting too big for the little boy’s hand to hold.<br />
<br />
In a wave of shock, Cody stumbled backwards, watching as a shimmering black hoof hung from where Jason’s hand was supposed to be. “Th-tha… that’s…” Cody stammered, not sure what to say, looking up at Jason to gauge his fear only to see there wasn’t any. He was as oblivious to the hoof as he was the unicorn nuzzling at his cheek, lightly lapping at his neck.<br />
<br />
“I swear, I’m gonna get Mom to force you to get your eyes checked, then your head checked.” Jason scoffed, clacking his hoof-hand against the stall door. “You’re more trouble than you’re worth if you pull me away from important stuff to go on these wild goose chases. Unicorns – is that really what you’re gonna say?”<br />
<br />
Cody didn’t have a response. What could he say as he watched splotches of black fur sprout from his brother’s skin where the horse had nuzzled him? Aura was licking and kissing at his growing horse hide wherever it sprouted, infatuated with Jason like a school girl with her first crush. Every teasing touch from the unicorn seemed to make Cody’s older brother stretch out a little… muscles and ligament roiling under his skin like magma as it expanded out into thicker muscles, his neck getting a little longer… his shoulders a little broader. And through all that, the older boy seemed completely unaware.<br />
<br />
Aura’s thick, rubbery horse lips seemed to have a pull with Jason’s body, the seventeen-year-old’s very shape bending and buckling at her command, those soft unicorn kisses blessing the boy with a body worthy of her affection. The stalls began grow hot as Jason’s sweat glands changed into a horse’s, the humid smell of stallion saturating the air as equine sweat glistened on his black horse hide. Muscle and fat began stretching out Jason’s meager human coverings, his T-shirt bloating out triple its size before finally exploding into polyester threads as a thick equine ponch barreled out his core body. Denim-bursting muscle began to ignite in his legs, quickly reduced Jason’s jeans to shreds of fabric as his underwear held on for dear life against the asinine bulge forming in the crotch of his briefs. His muck boots likewise deformed and melted into a distorted masses of rubber as two giant hooves burst out, crushing the material underneath him.<br />
<br />
The whole barn shook as Jason fell the ground on all fours, his spine snapping loudly assuring him he’d never walk on two legs again. Jason didn’t seem to mind at all though, still berating his younger brother for wasting his time, his speech slurring as his lips started to get fatter, teeth creaking and expanding into grass-gnashers as a muzzle fit for a horse overtook the better portion of his face.<br />
<br />
“*Snort* I can’t believe… you interrupted my work… just to play pretend about unicorns.” Jason managed to say as his neck elongated, pulling his vocal cords taut as his voice became high pitched, every word beginning to trail off into whinnies. “*Neigh*… sush a dork… Codheee…”<br />
<br />
Cody couldn’t tear his eyes away from the horror show in front of him, his brother’s huge, black-fuzzed rear turned towards him as his ass cheeks bloated out, pulsing with strength as they reshaped into two giant equine flanks. His underwear was putting up a heroic effort to keep his brother modest, still concealing Jason’s changing junk even as those giant ass cheeks forced that stretched out fabric deep into his ass crack. Just beneath the thin layer of cotton, Cody could make out a thick, tube-like ring press against those underwear, the moist black equine flesh wetting the white fabric as that thick horse donut tried to rip through Jason’s briefs. They held for now, but they couldn’t keep a fat bulge of elongating spine from busting through the flesh on the top part of Jason’s rear, growing out into a long, regal, black tail. The thing that did the underwear in were Jason’s testicles, his balls starting to bloat from the size of golf balls to softballs, the swelling orbs of stallion pride bashing against the stretched-out underwear, bulging larger and larger until-<br />
<br />
*Rip!*<br />
<br />
The white fabric shred down the middle, Jason’s balls flopping free underneath his hindlegs as that glistening ebony donut of horse anus twitched just below his tail. As the underwear sloughed off Jason’s body, the younger boy caught sight of his brother’s still-human cock getting reeled into an ever-expanding cage of black, fuzzy horse sheath on his belly, disappearing as it slipped inside that big cock-holster meant for an equine.<br />
<br />
Cody felt sick watching his brother’s balls mutate into something bestial, those dangling peach-colored orbs fitfully bulging out fatter inside his still-human sack, only for black leathery skin to corrupt it too. Jason’s balls grew to the size of cantaloups as they transformed into cum factories for his new species. Cody queasily looked on as few strands of viscous jizz splurt of from the tip of Jason’s sheathed cock, the boy surmising that that was his balls expelling the last of Jason’s human cum… the last of his human children clinging helplessly to his horse sheath, dripping onto the barn floor below.<br />
<br />
Then just like that, Jason’s cursing stopped… his eyes shimmering with a magical gleam as something on the inside seemed to change. His eyes… they looked like any other’s horses now.<br />
<br />
“J-Jason?” Cody managed to step towards the huge, black Percheron stallion, the boy quickly managing to slip a halter around the horse’s head, trying to tug him away from Aura… but to his dismay, he couldn’t pull the huge horse away.<br />
<br />
“Jason! Get away from her… she’s changing you…!” Cody cried, only to be thrown off the halter by a shake of the huge horse’s head.<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t know I’m a unicorn,” Aura explained, shooting Cody a mirth-soaked unicorn smile as the stall’s latch opened on its own, letting her step out towards Jason. “Only virgins can see me, and I could tell this one was a real stud.” Cody didn’t really understand, but the new horse read her body language straight away, nibbling and rearing against Aura in an equine mating ritual, the magical horse turning tail towards Jason as her tasseled unicorn tail lifted up, revealing her fat, flesh-colored horse pussy to the horny male.<br />
<br />
“Let’s make sure all the changes stick, shall we?” Aura cooed, backing her rear up in between the Percheron’s legs.<br />
<br />
“Jason, don’t!” Cody warned his older brother to no avail, the new horse plunging his snout deep into those plump pussy lips, nibbling on them with his own, pulling back with his nose covered in stringy strands of mare juice. Before Cody could grab that halter again, Jason hopped up out of reach, clutching the mare’s back, climbing up top her until that sheath was pressed square against her soaking vaginal lips.<br />
<br />
Jason’s cock hadn’t changed yet, the oversized sheath hardly letting his human bell-end out as the huge horse mashed it against the rim of Aura’s giant horse vulva. With all his might and desperation, Cody shoved Jason’s flank, trying to get him off Aura’s back, but it was no use. Soon that human tip had sunk in between those flabby mare lips, Jason’s glans getting soaked in horse cum as he jabbed away at Aura’s winking clit. Aura whined out a lustful whinny in response, her horn gleaming as Jason’s dick seemed to get thicker all of a sudden, muscle bulging out as another inch of cock sank into those sweltering hot mare innards… then another inch… then another…<br />
<br />
Cody’s shaking hands did all they could to shove Jason off, but he could tell it wasn’t working, his brother’s cock getting fleshier and darker as black equine skin wrapped tight around those bulging cock muscles. The horse on top pulled himself in and out of the mare, slamming his need deep inside her, ramming against her cervix with every thrust. The reeking smell of horse sex made Cody feel faint, the little boy sensing flecks of sizzling hot horse juices splatter on his skin as he heard the mating getting sloppier, Jason’s powerful thighs spanking against Aura’s thick rump with meaty slaps.<br />
<br />
Cody pulled away, tears strewing down his face as his brother was lost in his first equine orgasm, the horse that used to be Jason biting down hard on Aura’s neck, letting out an ear-ringing whinny as thick globs of horse cum filled the unicorn’s belly, an over-flow of jizz spewing down her shaking legs.<br />
<br />
The two rocked back and forth for several minutes as the unicorn milked Jason’s cock for every drop of seed, the two relishing the afterglow of bestial bliss until Aura tugged herself away, leaving Jason to clop back down on the ground – completely and utterly a horse.<br />
<br />
Cody shivered as he watched Jason’s flaccid horse dick sway like a pendulum underneath his old brother’s broad equine barrel, his cock almost two and half feet long, but slowly retracting back inside that pudgy horse sheath.<br />
<br />
“Ch-change him back!” Cody turned accusingly towards a very satisfied Aura. “You got what you wanted! Turn him back!”<br />
<br />
“Nope. I want a nice, long, relaxing vacation, you know.” Aura said in a soothing voice, dipping her head down to nuzzle Cody’s cheek.<br />
<br />
The boy wasn’t having any of it, recoiling away from her, repeating his demand. “Change him back, now! Please… he’s a human being!”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t look like it to me!” Aura giggled, her horn sparkling a magical glow as she lifted Cody high in the air and plopped him a top Jason’s back. “I think he’s a big, beautiful stallion.”<br />
<br />
“N-no… he’s not!” Cody tried to deny it, his hands balling into fists around Jason’s mane… but she was right. Years of experience horseback riding as a human had changed his brother into the perfect horse, every errant twitch of horse muscle under Cody’s butt slightly adjusting him, making sure he was safe on Jason’s back even as he started to go faster. His gate was impeccable, each and every step trained at balancing the little rider even, Jason’s legs lifting in the air confidently as he strode along smoothly. He was a sure-fire blue ribbon winner. He’d probably cost as much as a Lamborghini at auction. He really did make a better horse than a human…<br />
<br />
“He’ll be treated nice on your farm, I’m sure.” Aura whinnies towards Cody. “Kept healthy… free to be an animal. It’s just for my stay here mind you, I’ll change him back as soon as I leave.”<br />
<br />
“R-really?” Cody looked over to Aura, hope finally lighting in his eyes. “Back to the normal, human Jason?”<br />
<br />
Aura nods, “I hardly have the time to mate as a forest guardian, so once I return to my post, you can have him back.”<br />
<br />
Cody looks down at Jason as he sits on the horse’s back, his sadness quickly changing into a rush of excitement. What seemed horrible suddenly turned into a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.<br />
<br />
“And you…” Aura nuzzled her snout playfully against Cody’s leg, “Since you’ve been such a good host so far, I’d like to offer you a vacation too.”<br />
<br />
“A vacation…?” Cody asked, a little concerned about what she was insinuating.<br />
<br />
“You’re never once wondered what it would be like to be an animal? To have all your needs taken care of…” Aura stuck her snout up against Cody’s ear, whispering, “… to mate.”<br />
<br />
“Not… until now…” Cody responded, treading softly in the conversation, realizing the unicorn could change him at the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
“Just like your brother, I’ll change you back too once I’m finished with my holiday. You can become any farm animal you want, boy or girl… but mind you, once you lose that virginity of yours, you’re gonna be just like your brother - you’re not gonna be able to see me. That means you’ll stay that animal for the duration of my visit after you mate.”<br />
<br />
“Oh… I guess I just won’t mate then.” Cody stated, being too young to realize that mating urges sometimes get too strong to hold back.<br />
<br />
Aura gave Cody a knowing smirk, waiting to hear Cody’s animal of choice.</p>
