<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the weeks go on and Elli tries to get the Chronivac back from his mom he becomes heavier and rounder by the day.<br />
<br />
Little did Elli know that his mom had taken the Chronivac&#39;s scan of him which now showed that he was pregnant. She upped the number of fetus&#39;s to 6. <br />
<br />
She also adjusted Dan&#39;s and Elli&#39;s profile to show that they were now married.<br />
<br />
She made sure that they were living in a double wide trailer. Dan was a garbage man because as Elli&#39;s mom said &quot;That was all he was good for anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elli&#39;s boobs became enormous as his belly expanded to a gargantuan state. Dan would come home from work stinking to high heaven and Elli would have dinner on the table for him.  Which was no easy feat with the load he was carrying in front of him.<br />
<br />
As the weeks turned into months and the time came close to birth there was one last change that his mother made. <br />
<br />
She turned him back into a boy but left him greatly pregnant. As he and Dan woke the next morning he was laying on his back, because he could no longer sleep any other way. Dan was snuggled up to him, snoring, and his arm cradling his enormous belly.<br />
<br />
When an extreme wave if pain went through Elli&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m in labor he yelled.<br />
<br />
As he woke and Dan woke he stood up and looked in the mirror. He realized that he was now a man.<br />
<br />
How the hell are they going to get out of me he screamed to Dan.<br />
<br />
Call your mother, she&#39;s a midwife.<br />
<br />
Me shouted Elli. I can hardly call her in all this pain. You call her.<br />
<br />
You know she hates me.<br />
<br />
Yea well you get her little boy pregnant she&#39;s going to be pissed now call her.<br />
<br />
Dan called Elli;s mom who was well aware of the events occurring.<br />
<br />
Mom Elli shouted at his mom as she came through the door, turn me back into a girl for the birth please.<br />
<br />
Oh no this will be much more painful as a boy.<br />
<br />
How the hell are they going to get out of me.<br />
<br />
Well we have two options. They could come out the way they come out of a girl. <br />
<br />
This will rip my pee pee to shreds. <br />
<br />
Now you know how a girl feels after she has a baby.<br />
<br />
Or they can come out your ass.<br />
<br />
Same problem mom. Why can&#39;t you do a Cesarean?<br />
<br />
Do I look like a Dr.<br />
<br />
Well call one.<br />
<br />
We don&#39;t have time those babies are coming. I suggest you go with the ass.<br />
<br />
Ok Ok Ok. Elli was panting.<br />
<br />
Ok now bend over the  bed belly down.<br />
<br />
But girls have their legs up. <br />
<br />
Yes but they are giving birth out of their vagina so we are going to have to have you applying some pressure on your stomach and give me access to your ass.<br />
<br />
They huffed and puffed. Dan go get some hot towels.<br />
<br />
As time went by the first was the hardest. It took time to stretch Elli&#39;s asshole but soon the first was born.<br />
<br />
Not long of a wait and the second was coming.<br />
<br />
Why can&#39;t we call a Dr. this is taking forever.<br />
<br />
We are doing fine honey.<br />
<br />
It took a full 6 hours for all the babies to be born and soon daddy and babies were exhausted and laying in bed. Elli felt the wind whipping through his ass gaping open wider than he ever thought it would ever get.<br />
<br />
Mom Elli asked exhausted, when will my ass close up.<br />
<br />
Oh sweety it will never fully close. You are probably going to have to wear adult diapers. Definitely later in life but that is what happens when you are pregnant.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the grand-babies.<br />
<br />
Dan gently lifted one after the other to Elli&#39;s man boobs and they fed for the first time.<br />
<br />
When Elli was able to get around he looked for the marriage licence but when he saw that it was a same sex marriage licence he realized that his mom had thought of everything.<br />
<br />
It was a few months later that Elli also realized one other thing his mother had thought of. <br />
<br />
Elli was pregnant again but this time he would go to term as a man.<br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t completely evil she made sure that he would only have one baby at a time from then on and she made sure that Dan would want to have a baby every year.<br />
<br />
Dan&#39;s career in garbage raised him to truck driver but he never advanced any further than that. Elli&#39;s mom made sure that like every straight pregnancy as the woman gained weight so did the husband and so did Dan. <br />
<br />
Dan was there for the first babies but there on out like other husbands he lost interest. But Elli now had some man boobs to play with as his belly filled out again.</p>
