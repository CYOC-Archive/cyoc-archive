<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think it’s time to pack it up for the day, kiddo.” Kelly said to the nine-year-old boy she was babysitting, Casey, trying to break the bad news to him. “It’s a weekday, so the zoo closes at six, we gotta leave soon or the keepers will try to chase us out, ya know?”<br />
<br />
Casey kept a resolute grasp on his babysitter’s hand, tugging her from exhibit to exhibit trying to make the day last a little longer, watching as the hot summer sun continued to drift from its apex in the sky down towards the tree line. The zoo was practically empty now, save for the odd family or couple making their way to the exits.<br />
<br />
“B-but… we didn’t see everything yet…” the boy huffed, trying to come up with an excuse to not head home just yet… to try to make this outing mean something.<br />
<br />
Kelly had been babysitting Casey for two years during the summer breaks from school, and some things were starting to change between them… or as least, Casey felt that way. He was starting to get to “that age”, the age where he stopped seeing girls as gross and started to see them in a different light… and did Kelly have a lot for Casey to see. She was 18 and had just graduated high school, during which she was a lacrosse player and a track and field runner. She was strong but still soft – but most importantly, her breasts looked really nice, the sort of boobs that jiggled a little as she walked, the sorta boobs that Casey really, really wanted to touch.<br />
<br />
Kelly probably just saw this as a usual summer outing, a standard day at her job as a babysitter, but Casey wanted it to be a date. The younger boy’s hand was sweating in hers, Casey trying to bide his time until he could figure out how he could kiss her or touch her boobs or something…<br />
<br />
“K-Kangaroos!” Casey blurt out, “They’re my favorite animal! I just wanna see them and I promise we can go!”<br />
<br />
They weren’t really his favorite, but he knew the marsupial exhibit was on the other side of the zoo, so that would give him a lot of time to come up with something. Then… an announcement came over the zoo’s loudspeakers:<br />
<br />
“All patrons, the zoo is closing in fifteen minutes. Please make your way to the main entrance. We hope you all had a WILD day!”<br />
<br />
Kelly sighed, peering at the time on her phone as she thought about it “That’s pretty far, huh? You say they’re your favorite animal? Well, we can do it, but we’re gonna need to hustle.”<br />
<br />
She let go of Casey’s hand and started to jog off towards the Australian exhibit, turning around to wave the boy in her direction. “If you want to see them, you’re gonna have to run for it, kiddo!” She smirked, “We gotta get there in five minutes if you wanna get that quick look at the roos!”<br />
<br />
Casey gulped, running after her. He had hoped for a long walk towards the Kangaroo exhibit so he could think, but now that turned into a sweat-induing jog in the hot summer sun. Since Kelly was so much taller than him, Casey practically had to sprint to keep up with the track and field star, the boy panting as the exhibit came into view.<br />
<br />
“Good time!” Kelly pat the exhausted boy on the head as they reached the Kangaroo enclosure, “We’ve got two minutes before we gotta beat it, let’s go an eye-full of ‘em!”<br />
<br />
Casey nodded dejectedly, realizing that no matter how hard he wanted it, the day was coming to an end. It’d have to end without him admitting his feelings to Kelly. He trudged towards the exhibit’s rails, looking down inside to try and find the animals. Like most of the large-animal enclosures at the zoo, it was basically a really wide fifteen-foot deep hole in the ground surrounded by railing that the guests could safely look down at the animals from. But for some reason, the boy just couldn’t see any.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” Kelly huffed, “These are apparently Red Kangaroos, the biggest ones… where could they be…? Ah!”<br />
<br />
Kelly pointed straight down at a mob of Kangaroos, hiding underneath the enclosure’s shadow to cool themselves from the hot sun. “There they are! Right there!” Kelly called out to Casey.<br />
<br />
“Where?” Casey asked, trying to stand on his tip-toes to peer down over the railing. “I’m not -uuff… big enough to see them!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Casey felt hands lift him up underneath his armpits, Kelly hefting him up in the air before resting him between the enclosure’s rails and…<br />
<br />
Her boobs. Casey could feel her soft cleavage envelope his lower back as his babysitter balanced him against the railing. His was speechless, paralyzed, a blush heating up his face as he wiggled around a little to feel her tits’ form against him, her sweat-stained top the only thing between him and those big breasts that he idolized. For the first time in his life, he felt his pants start to stir, his dick getting chubby as blood rushed from his head towards the first erection of his life.<br />
<br />
“See ‘em? Right there.” Kelly leaned over the railing a little more so that Casey could get a better view, squishing the boy right into her cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah.” Casey stammered, unable to say anything else to her, wishing that this moment would never ever end.<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to the two, watching sentry over the zoo, cupid sat on the roof of a nearby pavilion, looking down at Casey and his babysitter while pondering why there were so few Kangaroos in North America.<br />
<br />
“Maybe they’re endangered?” The fairy thought, stroking his quiver and fiddling with a love-at-first-sight arrow. “There really ought to be more…”<br />
<br />
Cupid had bided his time, waiting for the park to empty. For some reason, it usually caused a panic when other people saw the love-arrow take effect, so it was best to only use it when the subject and their new lover were nearby.<br />
<br />
The fae deity of love unfurled his bow, tightening up an arrow in its flaxen string as he aimed towards the girl’s butt.<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess they are pretty cool, huh?” Kelly looked down at the the animals, then back to the boy squished between her breasts. “I think we’ve gotta head out n-“<br />
<br />
Kelly yipped as she felt a stinging pain strike her in butt cheeks. She reflexively jumped, toppling over the railing. Casey’s warm perch against her boobs now turned into a freefall, both the boy and his babysitter spiraling, dropping face-first into the Kangaroo enclosure below.<br />
<br />
For a moment Casey saw himself hugged tight to Kelly’s body… then darkness. He was dead. He knew he was dead. His skull had to have been instantly smashed against the ground. This was the afterlife – nothing but darkness. Warm darkness…?<br />
<br />
He could move his fingers. He still had hands and could feel his limbs and… his surroundings. He felt like he was wrapped up tight, reminiscent of how it felt to have his mom tuck him in way too much in bed, squeezing him between his sheets and his mattress. Fleshy, supple walls jostled around him, soft and membranous, stroking along his little form like a blanket as he struggled to get his bearings. Everything felt slightly moist, sweaty even. At first, he thought he was just exerting himself too much, but it was everywhere, lubricating his little form in this strange fleshy cage he found himself in. He could hear the gentle percussion of a heartbeat coming from all sides. Breathing. Muscles twitching. He was inside someone… Eaten? No - getting eaten would hurt. This felt didn’t hurt at all… in fact, it was sort of nice.<br />
<br />
“Oh… ugh.. ow…” Came the rumbling echo of a voice around him. It was Kelly’s voice, but it was coming from all sides. Her tone sounded dour, worried – like something was wrong. Like she was hurt!<br />
<br />
The boy pried himself away from the cozy walls of sweat-drenched flesh, kicking and grabbing at it to try to reach some sort of opening. The skin stretched and flexed around him as he pulled himself up against those soft curtains of flesh, daylight starting to peak out, an opening nearly in reach.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his head popped free, the boy hefting himself out of the fleshly prison until his shoulders were free, freezing on the spot as he suddenly took stock of where he’d just been.<br />
<br />
The back of Casey’s head rubbed up against Kelly’s lower belly, her soft girly skin stroking his hair. A thick band of her flesh was hugging around him from the front, keeping him pressed tight against her as Casey gripped it. It was…. a pouch?<br />
<br />
Casey looked up from the strange human-skinned pouch to see Kelly. She was panting, leaning against the stone enclosure wall for dear life as held her head like she was having the worst migraine ever. Her clothes were tattered, ripped apart by the fall. She must have taken the brunt of the impact for both of them, and by some miracle her body looked hardly worse for wear. Casey’s eyes widened as he got a glimpse at the shredded T-shirt on her chest, his reptilian brain wresting control of his mind as he caught a glimpse of Kelly without her top on. His first pair of bare boobs ever.<br />
<br />
In the late-day twilight, the sun cast a glow across her sweat-drenched mammaries as they jiggled on her chest with every panting breath. Her skin there looked impossibly soft, a pale peach color accented by a pinkish blush that kept spreading. Fleshy-pink nipples capped the tips of each of her breasts, standing erect as if beckoning the little boy to touch them.<br />
<br />
Casey wanted to… he wanted to so bad, but he could tell Kelly wasn’t right. He instead rubbed her belly, feeling the soft skin under his hand as he tried to get her attention. “Kelly? Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
A silvery strand of drool slipped form her mouth as she sighed out a moan before dipping her head down to look towards Casey. She smiled at him in a weird way, the girl still rubbing her head against the well for some sort of relief. She reached down with both hands, one to stroke Casey’s head and the other to tug inside the fleshy sack of a pouch that held him. “Ohhh…” She huffed, kneading her pouch between her fingers. Casey yelped as he felt himself suddenly sink inside a little deeper, as if that fleshy cage had expanded as Kelly tugged at it.<br />
<br />
“I’m… okay, little guy.” Kelly reassured him in a less than reassuring tone. “I just… feel weird. Just… really warm all of a sudden.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should go! You’re probably hurt, you fell a long ways!” Casey blurted out, gripping onto the rim of Kelly’s pouch as it threatened to swallow him whole again. “Something’s not right! Let me out! You didn’t have this before, did you!?”<br />
<br />
Kelly lazily tugged at her pouch and pet Casey’s head, engrossed at the boy suspended by her tummy as if she couldn’t focus on anything else. “I… didn’t?” Her speech slurred as she idly wriggled her hips, feeling Casey’s weight inside her. She seemed fascinated by it, groaning at the sensation as if she were singularly enamored by it.<br />
<br />
“No!” Casey shouted, trying to keep himself from dipping inside Kelly’s pouch as she swayed. “My mom doesn’t have a pouch, so I know other girls don’t!”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kelly looked down at him with a tilted head as if she were deeply confused, as if she didn’t know what her own body was supposed to look like. “Maybe…” She granted; her words thick as drool as she reached down a hand to heave Casey up by the armpit. Casey felt himself get lifted out for a moment before Kelly let him go and he dropped back inside that pouch once more. Kelly’s hips shivered in pleasure as she felt his weight again.<br />
<br />
“Umm…” Kelly looked down at Casey, a strand of saliva dripping from her lips, “Maybe… you want to stay?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Casey banged against her belly indignantly. “Go! We have to go!”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Kelly said happily, “You stay and we go!”<br />
<br />
The frustrated boy gripped Kelly’s pouch tight as the teenage girl walked alongside the exhibit’s high walls. She seemed happy to leave, so long as the kid she was babysitting stayed inside her pouch. Kelly kept a hand against Casey’s head to keep him from getting out as she searched for some way to scale the fifteen-foot wall of the enclosure. But soon after they started to search, it dawned on them that the other animals might have had something to say about the two intruders.<br />
<br />
One of the enclosure’s occupiers hopped up to them. It was one of the kangaroos - a huge Red Kangaroo. At first the kangaroos seemed content to keep away and watch the pair of humans that fell into their habitat from a distance, but now one of the seven-foot-tall creatures saw fit to get a closer look. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we go.” Kelly lisped at the animal, drool still pooled in her mouth as the giant kangaroo stood high up on its two legs and shoved her back against a wall with its massive forearms.<br />
<br />
Casey was in shock as he heard Kelly’s head slam against the concrete barrier, the girl managing to stand upright and keep a hand on the boy’s head even after that hit. The kangaroo peered down at Casey in the pouch, its grabby paws clutching onto an arm as it threatened to pull Casey up and into… her pouch.<br />
<br />
It was another female, and clearly she was very interested in what she thought was a joey – so interested she was willing to fight for Casey. The girl kangaroo bashed her stomach against Kelly’s, smooshing Casey head against her fur as she forced the arm she grabbed inside her pouch. Casey tried to relent, but it was no use! The animal was way too strong!<br />
<br />
Casey could feel Kelly’s hand slip away from his head, his tiny body forced forward as another hand was made to slip into that warm fleshy sack in the animal’s belly. Inside, he felt something strange.<br />
<br />
Boobs. Soft, nippled mammaries inside the kangaroo’s pouch. He didn’t know kangaroos had those there and he’d never expected his first-time touching boobs to be like this! In his struggles to not get kidnapped by the handsy kangaroo, he felt his fingers squish and tug against those plush, bestial breasts, so soft that his hands were practically sinking into the skin. Casey could feel himself getting lifted up by the rear, about to get forced headfirst against those roo boobs when suddenly-<br />
<br />
“FUCK. OFF!” Kelly heaved, shoving the muscular red away with both hands! Casey toppled back into the girl’s pouch, watching the ornery animal huff steam out of its nostrils and instantly come back for a second go. Kelly quickly delivered a donkey kick to the red using both feet, launching it several feet onto the cold hard ground! … But wait… Both feet?<br />
<br />
Something wasn’t right. How could someone kick with both feet at once? Something… felt different. The boy suspended in Kelly’s pouch peered up, shocked to see that his babysitter had grown the physique of a cage fighter!<br />
<br />
 It didn’t seem possible. Her biceps rippled under her skin as Casey felt a six-pack of muscular abs brush against the back of his head. She’d become as strong as a world class-boxer in a matter of minutes, even growing unreasonably tall, matching the height of the attacking red! But worryingly, Casey realized she was missing something now… something dearly, dearly important to him.<br />
<br />
Her beasts were gone, they’d completely vanished from her chest – there was nothing there but bare skin! When the roo was trying to tug Casey into her pouch, did the animal somehow rip them off?!<br />
<br />
“MINE!” Kelly shrieked as she jumped on top of the opposing kangaroo, ready to beat the other animal into submission for Casey’s sake. But as both of her hands were occupied trying to punch the animal, Casey slipped out, falling to ground and turning tail to run away, hoping to not get crushed by the frenzied females. He ran until he reached the enclosure’s wall, standing against the wall for a moment, huffing and panting, realizing that it wasn’t actually a wall, but a door! A door out!<br />
<br />
The exit had been designed to look indistinguishable to the walls, but this was clearly a door used by zookeepers for maintenance! It was locked, but Casey banged on it, trying to alert and staff to save them. “HELP!” he screamed at the door, “My babysitter’s getting mauled by a kangaroo! Save us now!”<br />
<br />
The brawl was still underway behind him as the two combatants dished out hit after hit on one another. Casey was afraid to look, afraid to see Kelly’s pretty face all bloody and bruised after her boobs get ripped off, but he knew he had to swallow his fear and look. And look he did.<br />
<br />
Two? Two kangaroos!? At first the boy thought so, but that wasn’t the case. One of them was Kelly. She was taller than the female red now, her body was larger too. Her legs had altered into muscular digitigrade kangaroo springs, making her hop with every step as she wrestled the red to the ground. Kelly’s body was indistinguishable from the other kangaroo’s save for the fact that Kelly didn’t have any fur and her head was still human. She had a muscular, bulbous tail and paws now - paws where both her hands and feet were supposed to be. She kneeled down on all fours to charge at her opponent, knocking the animal back down as she hit it with the force of a linebacker, twisting her forearms around the kangaroo’s neck until she caught it in a head lock! Muscles bulged in Kelly’s marsupial arms as the opposing female struggled, eventually going limp, relenting, and admitting defeat.<br />
<br />
Kelly let the losing red kangaroo high tail away before hopping towards Casey on her bouncy legs, her still-human head looking extremely satisfied with herself.<br />
<br />
“Kelly! Oh God!” Casey backed into the enclosure’s wall as Kelly plopped down on her butt right in front of him, sitting like a Kangaroo. “You’re all wrong! Oh… what are we gonna do?!”<br />
<br />
She tilted her head like a confused puppy, answering in her drooly feminine voice, “Wrong..?”<br />
<br />
“Kelly…” Casey hyperventilated, crying as he looked at the deformed body of his first crush. “Don’t you get it!? You’re not supposed to be like this! You’re practically an animal… and worst of all that stupid kangaroo hurt you! It tore off your boobs!”<br />
<br />
Kelly shot the boy another confused look before stepping forward, shoving her belly inches away from his face. “No.” She shook her head, reaching a paw down towards that fleshy skin strap of her pouch, tugging it open and downwards to show Casey the inside.<br />
<br />
Those fleshy pouch walls were slick with sweat worked up from the fight, the insides pink and blushing from all the blood pumping through Kelly’s body. Casey’s eyes widened in complete shock as realized he was wrong about her boobs. She diffidently still had them.<br />
<br />
Inside that pouch were two huge boobs, glazed with a heavy helping of sweat. The skin inside was practically steaming due to exposure to the evening air, Casey feeling Kelly’s body heat swelter against his face as he starred at her monstrously large tits. The flesh was pink, each boob jostling against one another with every breath hefting through Kelly’s lungs. Two swollen looking nipples capped each one at the tip, the ends reminiscent to Casey of nibs he’d seen on a baby bottle. Her tits were way bigger than the red he was almost forced inside of. If she was just becoming a kangaroo, why were the boobs in her pouch so busty?<br />
<br />
“W-why… did this happen?” Casey managed to say, eyes still transfixed on those roo boobs.<br />
<br />
She tilted her head again, playfully sticking out her tongue and pointing at herself with a paw. “Favorite!” She drooled out, scratching her head as if trying to think really hard. “Favorite… animal!”<br />
<br />
Casey looked at her in sheer confusion, not understanding at all. He didn’t understand that the first thing Kelly saw after getting struck by Cupid’s arrow wasn’t a kangaroo, but him. She wanted to become this. She was turning into Casey’s favorite animal just because she loved him, and he’d told her it was a kangaroo. The love magic had also picked up on another feature that Casey adored about Kelly, making sure there was a lot of it for him to enjoy. Soon Casey was about to learn there was more than one type of love that could change lives.<br />
<br />
“Mom!” Kelly pointed to herself, smiling as she kneeled down to nuzzle Casey and give him a kiss on the cheek. The boy was mortified, unsure of what to do as his babysitter seemed to be proposing adoption!<br />
<br />
“You’re not…” Casey trailed off, shivering as he felt that drooly tongue lip against his cheek, “… my mom.”<br />
<br />
Kelly shook her head, straightening her posture again as she reached back down towards her pouch, pointing to Casey, then to it. “Go.” She said with a giddy grin.<br />
<br />
Casey got another glimpse of that steamy roo pouch, the inner walls audibly squelching and shifting against one another as curtains of satiny soft flesh jostled against those huge boobs. Casey couldn’t see the bottom of it – the pouch must have gotten way bigger since Kelly changed… deeper even. Would he even be able to stick his head out if he were inside it? Could he even get out of there?<br />
<br />
Casey shook his head, scrambling away only for Kelly to quickly cover the distance and grab at him with those strong paws of hers. Casey whimpered as those marsupial muscles made quick work of his clothes, tearing his shirt clean off his chest, his shorts no match for a mother kangaroo trying to get to her joey.<br />
<br />
Kelly gave Casey another loving smile as her paws gently caress his hips, dipping one of those animal digits underneath the hem of his undies and tugging down, letting his erect prepubescent penis pop free. “Better.” She said, letting out a saliva-slickened giggle.<br />
<br />
Despite all of Casey’s struggles, he couldn’t stop Kelly from pulling him up with one paw, dangling him over her pouch that she’d tugged open with her other paw. She let go of him, his nude body disappearing into the tight, fleshy confines of her pouch before letting it slap close against her broad animal belly. As soon as Kelly felt the boy’s weight press down inside her, she slouched over and shuddered, her thick kangaroo tail hiking high in the air as a stream of liquid roo sex squirted out of her distinctly marsupial vagina, the new kangaroo enjoying her first animal orgasm before hopping away towards the rest of the reds, ready to relax with her baby safe inside her.<br />
<br />
Inside, Casey was surrounded by lewd, wet bestial flesh lapping against his nude body. His little form settled between the crevice of those two, giant boobs as that soft, yet firm skin jostled and rubbed around him. Ever movement of Kelly’s body forced the walls of the pouch to flex and shift, rubbing all over him and suspending him in the embrace of all the maternal skin. Casey clutched onto those giant marsupial boobs to try to pull himself out, only to find himself slipping all over the almost rubber-like flesh, his head falling back down just to be cradled by Kelly’s cleavage all over again. All he could hear was her breathing, her heartbeat, and the wet sound of slippery skin rubbing against his. The wet roo flesh brushed up against his erect cock, lush and moist marsupial skin nuzzling against his penis as his hands clutched tightly against Kelly’s huge animal breasts. Between those pillowy soft boobs, he didn’t stand a chance, the first orgasm of his life forcing him to spray his seed all over the folds of kangaroo flesh that were massaging his dick. His sperm mixed on with all the moisture locked inside Kelly’s pouch, making the insides of all the slicker and gooier.<br />
<br />
Casey huffed in exhaustion as that sweaty roo flesh brushed against his lips, smearing his adoptive mom’s taste all over his tongue. Casey could taste milk… Kelly was lactating. She wanted to nourish him with her body, to give him a food source while he’s locked away in that warm, cozy prison of her body. Casey tries to push himself away from that milky flavor, but the natural motions of Kelly’s body just force him right back into place – his lips smooshed in front of a tit, the sensitive skin begging to be suckled from.<br />
<br />
Casey didn’t know what to do. He was trapped inside the girl he loved. He wasn’t her boyfriend like he’d wanted earlier that day. He was her child.<br />
<br />
Trying to get rescue from a zookeeper was hopeless. He couldn’t climb out of this deep pouch on his own and his whole body was hidden inside Kelly - confined to this wet cave of marsupial flesh. He couldn’t even shout to the outside world, his voice was always muffled whenever he spoke by the warm, moist kangaroo skin rubbing up against his face.<br />
<br />
Would he change like her? He didn’t know. All he could do is wait for something to happen.</p>
