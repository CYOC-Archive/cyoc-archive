<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Grinning, Kat moved over to where Dan was. &quot;So, it seems like you&#39;ve invited your whole year from school. Heck, you even brought along a few extras.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you did wanted all of my friends over. That said, I&#39;m friends with nearly my whole school year. Even so, where are your friends? I don&#39;t see them anywhere, no at all kat.&quot; Dan replied as kat shortly replied to Dan&#39;s questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. About that, the first of the two I asked could only come over around at eight. With that, I decided to tell the rest of them to come over by then to, even if it was to late to inform you on this. Still, that&#39;s ok for me as you havealready called over many of your friends. Maybe I can get to know a couple of yours better, before any of my friends arrive here shortly.&quot; Kat answered, smiling.<br />
<br />
Everybody was enjoying themselves, including kat as she called this her pre-party. Kat eventually headed over to the kitchen that once there, with a few additional twenty minutes before entering the kitchen, she shortly after castes the spell. she wanted to try and cast this spell out the whole day, now she got her chance on casting it at the right moment.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back at the party, Dan and his friends didn&#39;t notice was really happening at the time with each of their costumes as they had become skintight on them. This also went unnoticed for the pieces had somehow merged together under their belts, with them vanishing into the costumes while becoming seamless. Nobody wore anything underneath then just their socks and underwear, which they shortly after also merged with their costumes.<br />
<br />
It was long when next when their costumes legs slowly crawled further down either connecting or covering to their shoes bit by bit. When all original normal shoes were covered that they even reformed to look like fitting parts to their wearer&#39;s costumes. Wreither it was paws with clawed feet, hooves, or something else that the insides had merged with their socks and became skintight underneath as well for this also went unnoticed by everyone to for everyone wearing mermaids tails were swimming outside of the pool.<br />
<br />
It was shortly after when the same thing happened to their hands, which was definitely the first time some of them noticed anything different. the crawling of the costumesarms covered their hands as it was also starting to reform into new gloves, causing a couple of glasses to drop down and hit the ground. With most of them being unable to hold anything anymore with only animal paws, hooves, fathers, and more of their front-feet were completely unable to do much that some animals in question had no arms or legs, like snake costumes remained as such were just covered in scales.<br />
<br />
With most of the party guests a bit confused now as to what was happening to their arms and hands, not understanding why they were covered that some started to panic. However, Dan quickly knew what was happening as he did his best efforts to keep his school year friends calm and ease them from panicking. It had to be Kat&#39;s doing,  even if he didn&#39;t believe it himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kat? Where is she?&quot; He asked slightly panicked, looking around for her, but his gaze were at his now black hooved fingers every few seconds. Nobody answered him though for they were all more transfixed on to their own costume changes, wondering what was going to happen to them now.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Seeing from the kitchen, Kat rejoined the other party members while having her illusion of the costume changing along with them. however, because her spell had been the reason as she didn&#39;t wore a costume herself that she wasn’t affected by the spell accidentally. She quickly moved over towards her brother as his changes were the most interesting to her, wondering if she wants to decide on changing her brother&#39;scostume later or not.<br />
<br />
Dan was confused as he stood there like he was staring at the head lights when Kat came to him, looking like her costume was changing along side with the rest of theirs that he didn&#39;t bother of asking her. His were fooled by her illusion spell, as by now that the costume started to cover up the last opening parts on each of their faces. with their hands and feet that there was only one side it could move from, but with their hoods above and around them is where it slowly begins to crawl from every side at once for this also  no minute later to reach the tip of their noses to fully and finally sealing them inside into their own personal costumes completely.<br />
<br />
Besides kat as it was for at that moment, everybody who was at the party were now froze in position. no one at the party was able to control their bodies, well, besides kat as she was free to move around them at will.the last outer changes took affect as their faces reformed to resemble their costume like mask, mostly pulling out into a snout muzzle.<br />
<br />
Once infront of Dan as she poke him in the stomach, kat smiled for she then went on to his snout. Taking both his right hand and tail in her control that she was happy that her spell worked, even if it was still mostly a costume. both his hands and snout were already feeling like the real thing to her as he was mentally screaming at her to stop it.<br />
<br />
Dan however tried to do anything to move for he couldn&#39;t even budge, not even a speck of his voice heard as he was unable to speak. Now Dan was scared as kat was poking and grabbing onto his butt that she later was doing this at him, like he was a toy or something to touch. This was so weird because what iritated him was that he felt every bit of it when she touched his snout, his tail, everywhere.<br />
<br />
Dan was in complete shock by all that was happening here, his own sister was freely walking around when his friends of the school year were completely stiff and unable to move or speak while even himself was caught up by all this as he was somehow able to feel what the costume parts of his outfit was feeling for this chilled him down to his spin which reached to even his new white deer tail. &#39;what going on? how could I  feel that? Why sis? Why? This, this doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s just a dumb costume, right?&#39;</p>
