<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janessa knew when the morning sickness returned that she was once again pregnant. She rubbed her belly with anticipation, the first time she was scared but now that she was more experienced she was excited to have a child she could truly have and raise as her own.  Janessa thought Yevgeny was truly a kind and compassionate man, and just thinking of him gave Janessa butterflies in her stomach. It had been two months since that fateful day with Yevgeny and Janessa was worried how the King would react. By now her belly had grown quite large, not as big as it was when she was first pregnant but still considerably large. It appears the fertility charm still held some magical sway over Janessa. Janessa knew not the fertility magic was slowly weakening or was permanent, but she was not concerned, she just hoped Yevgeny would be happy.<br />
<br />
King Antyny had made less and less trips to the royal nursery after the birth of his heirs. He would now only visit once a month as he grew more and more preoccupied with bolstering his power. But today he decided to take a unscheduled visit to see his sons. Upon his entry he was greeted by the sight of an obviously pregnant and half naked Janessa. “I see the castle whore has been busy.” Antyny stated with a cold and condescending tone.<br />
<br />
“Forgive me my lord! I was lonely and my needs were no longer being met.”<br />
<br />
“You do not need to seek favor from me whore. You have proven to be unable to deliver where it matters most, for you can only sire daughters and for that you have fallen out of favor.” Antyny looks at Janessa’s milk enlarged breasts with a smirk, “But this development is most beneficial for my sons...Yes now you can provide even more sustenance so they can grow big and strong.”<br />
<br />
“But my lord what of my unborn?”<br />
<br />
“What of it? My sons come first! Whatever is left may be given to your children.”<br />
<br />
Janessa began to tear up. “How could Antyny be so cruel?” She thought before remembering that he was the rebel leader and was still her enemy. After a few sobs Janessa agreed with Antyny in defeat.<br />
<br />
“I understand my lord. Please forgive my oversight.”<br />
<br />
“See to it that it does not happen again, else you will find yourself on the streets.” Antyny completed his inspection and left the royal nursery without another word. Janessa finished nursing her sons then collapsed onto her bed crying. <br />
<br />
Janessa cried for hours, the thought of her unborn going hungry or being tossed out of the castle really scared her. So distraught was she that she did not notice as two figures entered the wet-nurse’s quarters. The sound of a familiar voice shook Janessa back to reality.<br />
<br />
“What happened? Why are you crying Janessa?” It was Yevgeny, and the sound of his calm voice made Janessa get up and run into his arms. She cried a bit more as she rested her head in his shoulders, she tried to explain but was still too shaken to  properly speak.<br />
<br />
After calming her nerves Janessa noticed that Yevgeny had brought the doctor with him and after explaining her confrontation with Anty she thanked both of them for comforting her. The doctor prepared everyone a cup of tea as they sat together, exchanging gossip and the latest news from around the castle. <br />
<br />
“Apparently one of the Barons is drawing quite a lot of public support and Antyny has his hands tied on this matter. Baron Byjor of house Ravenkroft has strong political and magical clout. Antyny can not simply brush him under the rug without causing massive waves within the royal court.” Yevgeny explained, “And the war with the loyalists has become one of attrition, Antyny has already gone and replaced his head general three times. Public support of the war is falling yet Antyny will not rest until the loyalists are defeated.”<br />
<br />
“Which is why we must be extra careful my lady” the doctor explained, “Now let us take a look at you.” The doctor proceeded to do his usual check up then he prepared many magical ingredients.<br />
<br />
“What are these for doctor?” Is it not to early for such medicines?” Janessa inquired.<br />
<br />
“My lady I have had extensive training in medicine both mundane and magical. I was only delaying Antyny when you were first pregnant, but now that he has what he wants he has no regard for you or your offspring, but we must be safe.” <br />
<br />
The doctor began mixing elixirs and chanting in a magical language. Janessa’s belly began to glow as the doctor performed a very ancient and powerful magic on Janessa and her babies. The ritual lasted all night but once it was complete the doctor explained.<br />
<br />
“My lady the magical charm my old friend Yevgeny provided you still lingers. You are pregnant with septuplets my lady. And while Antyny believes you are incapable of bearing sons you are in fact pregnant with seven sons.”<br />
<br />
Janessa was in tears again, but this time they were tears of joy. She was so happy that she would be able to provide Yevgeny a large family. She felt so content with being a mother to such a decent man as Yevgeny. The two then passionately hugged and kissed over the good news. After they shared that tender moment their attention was brought back to the doctor.<br />
<br />
“Now I cast a very old magic that my former mentor taught me. Your sons are now daughters, to keep Antyny from discovering the truth. They are protected by a powerful magic that even Antyny can not overcome, however, upon their eighteenth birthday they will revert back to their original forms.” The doctor looked over to Yevgeny as he continued, “I hope this rebellion is taken care long before that but as a fail safe we must play the long game. When Antyny least expects it seven strong warrior princes will rise to over throw him and his sons. In fact around that time his sons should also revert back to their original forms.”  The doctor looked to Janessa “Antyny magic is sting but not stable, and his spells will not hold forever. So I made it that when the magic on his sons forms fail so too will the forms of your daughters.”<br />
<br />
Janessa was stupefied by the doctor’s brilliance she was in awe with the foresight of this man and the might of his magic. “Why was this man not seeking to become king himself.” Janessa thought, but as if almost reading her mind the doctor explained “I am here only to help guide and enlighten.”<br />
<br />
At this point Yevgeny stood up. “Janessa once the babies are born we will have to separate them and send them into hiding. While few in number we have loyal friends and supporters all across the land our children will have the best education and training they can get. I know it will be hard but it is the only way to ensure they are safe.”<br />
<br />
Janessa understood what Yevgeny was telling her. It would be hard to say goodbye to her babies but if it meant they would be safe and potentially bring an end to Antyny then she would follow. Janessa really appreciated how sensitive Yevgeny was being with this subject, she could sense his true heartfelt love radiating from within him in his gentle words and kind actions. She was proud to be bearing the fruit of such a noble and kind man. Janessa rubbed her belly, and whispered words or comfort to her seven sons turned daughters before slipping off into a deep and tender sleep. Yevgeny lay Janessa to bed and tucked her in. He gave her a passionate kiss before leaving with the doctor.</p>
