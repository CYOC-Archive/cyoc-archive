<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Late summer was often a pretty busy place around Juliet Renard-Argente&#39;s chateau. Some of it related to the work related to the vineyards that surrounded much of the property, though Violet handled the bulk of that work. The big thing for Juliet was normally getting supplies, materials, and other associated lessons ready for the coming school year. Much of which often was often progressive as she had taught Olympe and the other girls through their younger classes and into their older ones, and after their conversions into Animalians she had to shift to the more standard lines of education. And with the girls reaching adulthood and a point where there really wasn&#39;t that much more that Juliet cold actually teach them, she had planned to repeat that process with the male students like Charles. The class size was small, but it was more hands on, and Juliet saw that as a means of success. <br />
<br />
Though, of course, thanks to earlier attempts by Olympe and the girls to try and set her up with Juan, that had led to a loss of trust in certain respects and only two of the new students were allowed to become Animalians. Juliet could understand her charges wanting her to be happy, and privately, since becoming an Animalian, she did have to admit that not having a romantic partner, and potential children of her own, was something that floated more and more in the back of her mind. Though, as things progressed after Josephine, Eloise, Marie, Olympe, Gigi, Fifi, and Mia attempts at &quot;forcing&quot; romance. Raoul Renee, a representative of the French government and a relatively low-level official had been there and been respectable to her, and as the girls apologized for their actions, it was soon revealed that Raoul had some interest in her. It was a bit of a surprise, but one that Juliet found herself accepting because of who he was and his own dedication.<br />
<br />
And that naturally blooming romance with him was something that sparked a lot of the work that Juliet was presently looking over and drew her gaze down to the engagement ring on her hand. The ring wasn&#39;t much, but it was honest and that mattered more to Juliet than anything else. She&#39;d grown up in wealth and enjoyed the fact that her family had enjoyed a fair amount of inherited wealth that survived the various political upheavals that France had always gone through. She didn&#39;t need a fancy ring, she just needed a good man, who Raoul was. There would then be the work that related to setting things up for the wedding, guests, and related issues. There was also the obvious fact that Juliet would need to have the Animalia Virus in her activated to convert Raoul, which would also come with its own related issues, such as moving arrangements to brings to the chateau. There was a lot to do on those fronts...<br />
<br />
&quot;But that work will be worthy,&quot; Juliet thought as her mind drifted back to Raoul&#39;s proposal.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was a relatively bright and warm day as Juliet walked with Raoul in Mardeuil. Technically, they could walk just about anywhere at Renardville as the French Animalian colony was being referred to. The chateau&#39;s grounds were extensive, and with it being summer, most of the students were largely out with their families or engaged in some other summer activity. About the only one who was really around the chateau was Olympe, and that was more her working with Blancheur and assisting with the work that covered the vineyards, that covered an even greater expanse of land. However, they weren&#39;t far from Mardeuil and at times it made sense to be outside her home and grounds, it would let her interact with others and provide a measure of support to the local businesses and people, something that her family had done and had largely saved them from things like the Terror in days of the First French Republic and as the Revolution began.<br />
<br />
Of course, walking and talking with Raoul was something that took Juliet away from many of those lines of thought that had always been there for her and her family. For he was a strong and dedicated man, even if his service was more in the public sector and one that often took him to many of the places where she had the most criticism. He wasn&#39;t entirely what she had imagined herself dating, both as a little girl, and then as an adult woman, and then immediately after becoming a Fox Animalian. But he was kind and caring. He listened and could be quite reasonable, and a lot of that was there before she and Raoul started dating. She learned more as they did start dating and found more to respect and that while he was involved as a government bureaucrat, his personal stances weren&#39;t too terribly far from where she was and had no personal desire force others into bad decisions. It made Juliet feel comfortable having him on her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I suspect things will be calmer for you, now that all the elections are over?&quot; Juliet asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calmer in that I won&#39;t be needing to be involved for election campaigning for a while,&quot; Raoul answered, &quot;though... while my party is in the coalition elected... it doesn&#39;t lead the coalition. So, some specifics in how your school may be addressed may change. Though, even if that weren&#39;t the case... our time together would have my superiors prefer to send a different representative to your school and I&#39;d be sent to other schools or administrative areas. So as to avoid a conflict of interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never take advantage of you,&quot; Juliet told him.<br />
<br />
Raoul gave a warm smile as they walked along and enjoyed the warm summer son and nodding to some others that were out on the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Raoul answered, &quot;but it is like your concern regarding all &quot;appearances.&quot; You wouldn&#39;t want to be accused of being abusive or improper to your students and I shouldn&#39;t be improper in how regulations are enforced... and thankfully, I&#39;m part of a team that can cover for me if need be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet looked down for a moment as they walked along, though they entered a small park area that wasn&#39;t too far from Mardeuil&#39;s main church. The park wasn&#39;t big, but it had a few shade trees and it wasn&#39;t uncommon for people free time to spend at least time in it when enjoying the outdoors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that feels like I&#39;m holding you from your work and responsibilities,&quot; Juliet said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t feel that way,&quot; Raoul said, &quot;meeting you... has been a pleasure. Even when it was only professional, I could see the strength and passion for your students and could see it as a mirror to my... and my family&#39;s drive to serve the people. It&#39;s brought things I hadn&#39;t felt since Desiree&#39;s mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused while thinking of his daughter&#39;s mother. She had been a fine woman but was sadly no longer there. It was one of those things that had left a hole in Raoul&#39;s heart that in the time they had been dating, Juliet had begun to fill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since she passed,&quot; Raoul continued, &quot;and sure... it may complicate the bureaucrats... but let them. YOU mean that much to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet perked her ears and smiled as they paused under a tree on a walking path that went through the park. Raoul seemed to be wrestling with something in his left front pants pocket, but she assumed it was a tissue or a handkerchief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juliet said politely and then had her eyes widen as Raoul got down onto one knee and produced a small box that he then held out to Juliet with both hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would be my honor to be at your side for the rest of our days,&quot; Raoul spoke as he opened the box to reveal a modest wedding ring.  &quot;Would you accept a common man&#39;s asking for your hand in marriage?&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet stood their silent for a moment, with one hand drifting up to her muzzle. She looked down on his tanned face, likely a result of his family&#39;s history in Algeria before De Gaulle decided fighting to keep that colony was no longer worth it. There were some gray and silver hairs in his hair, but she also knew that if he became an Animalian, he&#39;d have his youth restored. She barely noticed a couple of other people stopping to watch them from a distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will,&quot; Juliet managed after a moment and lifted Raoul up into a hug and then nuzzled his cheek with her nose, &quot;you have made me very happy and have been a good companion. I&#39;m also glad you don&#39;t feel ill of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are stunning beauty, Madam Renard-Argente,&quot; Raoul answered, &quot;I cannot think ill of you. Particularly when you&#39;ve accepted the company of an old fool such as I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would want kits in the future,&quot; Juliet told him, &quot;You would have to become a Red Fox Animalian for that... and you&#39;d regain your youth, just as I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;d be your young fool,&quot; Raoul said to her as he kissed her nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re no one&#39;s fool,&quot; Juliet answered and nuzzled him again.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it may have been cliche,&quot; Juliet thought to herself as she looked at the engagement ring she now wore, &quot;but it was romantic... and it will heal a great many things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those thoughts kept the smile on her face as she continued to go over guest lists, schedules, and everything else. The girls wanted to come and wanted to bring their families as well, though given things, it may not be until the fall that she and Raoul would be able to marry. At least that was when Juliet expected to be able to get things settled and scheduled. That could mean a Saturday wedding and something that might conflict with some of the work that many of the families of her students did. Not to mention that there was also going to be Raoul also being a bit protective of his daughter, who had taken some interest in Juan... who had presently followed her ballet troupe to Bordeaux where they were scheduled to perform.</p>
