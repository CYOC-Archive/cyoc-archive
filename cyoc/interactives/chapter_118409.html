<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Christine were at the Carnival again with your family behind them. All of them had arms full of suitcases and bags for the two of them. All of the Circus Performers were loading up the train for the tour to the next big show. Animals being loaded into their cars, performers climbing into the train, and trailers being moved onto cars for transportation. <br />
<br />
The Circus was an enormous group of trailers for all the performers, instead of giving them beds on car they were given trailers because the Circus usually stayed in one place for a month or so. You would have been bunked with another clown performer or two, but when you called ahead and told them the your girlfriend was coming with you, they gave you and her their own, but smaller trailer. <br />
<br />
Even so, your family and Christina went over to the trailer that had been chosen for the two of you, and your parent loaded up your things while you talked to Christina about how happy you were she was coming with you. <br />
<br />
When everything was loaded up and ready to go, the whistle of the train engine blew. <br />
<br />
Your father came over to you, and gave you a strong hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m proud of you son, you&#39;ve done something that not every clown in the world does. I want you to no only work hard here, but enjoy it. Traveling with my circus was some of the best years of my life. I met your mother there, and you known the rest.&quot; He came in a bit closer for a whisper. &quot;Also, hold onto her forever, I can see she makes you happy and be sure you keep her happy. You to have somethig strong.&quot; The two of you shook hands. <br />
<br />
Next your mother, she was tearing up and you hugged her and chuckling because it was typical her to be emotional at times like this. &quot;Be sure to call every week, otherwise I will call you and we know mothers always call at the worst time.&quot; The two of you chuckled again. &quot;I love you dear, don&#39;t ever forget that and be sure to brush your teeth, sleep, eat well, and enjoy yourself.&quot; You just gave her an eye roll and a smile.<br />
<br />
Your little sister Daisy. You picked her up and put her hugged her tightly. &quot;Enjoy the house while I&#39;m gone. Make sure that you and Bottles enjoy your childhood, and who knows. Maybe you&#39;ll be doing what I am when you become old enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
You put down your little sister, and then go over to bottles to which a few of the performer girls are cooing over as you mother holds him. <br />
<br />
You walked over to him. Honked his nose which made him giggle and gave him a little hug. <br />
<br />
With all of you&#39;re goodbyes finished you and Christina climbed into your trailer, the train blew its whistle, and you departed with Christina into the adventure of a lifetime. <br />
<br />
3 weeks later:<br />
<br />
Christina was sitting in the Dining car of the Circus train. She was eating while reading a good book. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina turned and saw a man dressed in a smart suit, wearing a cape, black on the outside, while red on the inside. He was sitting behind her. Little did she know it was Mesmero, the man who had magically turned her former human boyfriend into a clown. Only Mesmero and the Ringmaster remembered the old human Buttons. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothings wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve picked at you food, you&#39;re not sitting with anybody, and you&#39;ve been on that same page for the past 10 minutes.&quot; Mesmero said with an arched eyebrow smile as he walked around and sat in the same booth in front of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, my boyfriend was hired for the circus, and I was happy to come with him but I feel kind of sad being here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you leave your job behind?&quot; Mesmero asked as he put his fingertips on his wand, ready to help her fit in more at the circus. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was let go the day he was hired. But I just feel...&quot; she trailed off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Out of place and without purpose here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...yes...&quot; Christina said reluctantly. She loved Buttons, but she needed to do something, a project at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how you feel. I can help you fit in more. There are still a few job postings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m no performer, I have two left feet and stage fright.&quot; She said with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who is your boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Buttons the Clown. White skin, blue hair, bald.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! I remember, a great addition to our circus. You said he was your boyfriend?&quot; Mesmero said a little quizzically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Long story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help you fit in more. There are postings to be greeters of the audience at the entrance. It&#39;s how I started, some of the guests even work here now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina pondered for a moment. Then said, &quot;Why not. Work your magic Mr....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mesmero.&quot; He said as he smiled because it literally was magic.<br />
<br />
He took his wand from his suit sleeve and tapped Christina on the forehead and she began to change rapidly. Christina blacked out for a moment. Then when she came too she was still in the booth with Mesmero sitting across from her. But she saw a touch of red below your vision, she then shuffled around because of the uncomfortable position and you found that their was something weighing herself down, and her feet were stuck on the table supports. <br />
<br />
She was a clown now. Christina had become Sunshine the Clown. Her blond hair had turned bright yellow, and it was thick and luscioud as it wove behind her head and cascaded over her shoulders. Her skin had turned completely white and it&#39;s covered her body from head to toe. Her face was now made up of a simple clown. <br />
<br />
Her eyes to begin with were covered in red eyeshadow, and her eyebrows had grown much fuller until they were at least a few inches long and they fluttered every time she blinked. She was often asked if she was wearing fake ones, and while she did once it just made them look more hairy. Her eyebrows had become wavy lines on her face, and her cheeks were roughed with blush that made her face look more cute and scrunched together. Her mouth was something uncommon for a clown, her lower lip was red and curled up slightly in a smile, but her upper lip was not colored in except for the front, making it look like her lips were always a bit puckered. Lastly her nose was a bright red ball that conplemeted her eyeshadow, it was about the size of a golf ball to a peach, and had air holes on the bottom for breathing. <br />
<br />
Next Christina looked down and saw that she wasn&#39;t wearing her previous sweats and shirt, but was now wearing a dress, a dress fit for a clown. It was yellow and red babydoll dress with shoulderpoofs that were red, and the dress itslef was yellow with differently sized polkadots, it was also accented wiht a petticoat, bloomers, and yellow clown shoes that fit her now size 20 feet well, before they were a little less than 9. Her final change was realizing what was wheighing her down was her enourmous butt, before she had a slight bubble butt, and didn&#39;t care much for her figure. But she could now tell each cheek was at least the size of soccer balls giving you an enourmous pear shape.<br />
<br />
You look at Mesmero for a moment, and then all of the memories come in. You remebered growing up as a young clown girl with you family who were also clowns now. You remebered learning how to juggle with her father when you were younger, and learning to bake pies with her mother as well. She could remeber meeting Buttons in school, and when the two of them realized they were both real clowns, the two of them hit off. She were never one to entertain big crowds, for a clown it was odd to have stage fright but  made up for it in her jokes and having an infectious sunny personality. It was true that she had gotten a real job and did her best, but was cut recently just as Buttons was getting hired. So she came along, and had met mesmero in the dining car and he had convinced her to instead of being a performer to greet the guests at the main entrance with some of the other performers. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you so so much for listening Mr. Mesmero, greeting the guests sounds like a great idea.&quot; Sunshine said in her squeaky Minnie Mouse voice. Sunshine says that as she scooted out of the booth, and start walking back to her trailer. With her shoes making slapping sounds and enlarged clownish rear swaying. <br />
<br />
Mesmero couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, he loved transforming people, but he also loved it when that transformed person loves their new selves so much. <br />
<br />
And now Sunshine was back at her trailer, she was...</p>
