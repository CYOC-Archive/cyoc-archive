<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having a strange connection to Ordon for he was very hansom to your eyes that you started to have feelings for him to stay with as the thought of going somewhere a bit more privately, somewhere to be with him at least. you were lucky to remember that Lily also handed you a spare room key for your vacation stay, but you wanted to head over to Ordon&#39;s place to where you would like to stay the nights with him even. Pulling out your room key that Ordon shortly after got the idea when he saw you holding it for you were looking at him lovingly as he did what any lover steps would take for he then pulled out his from the side of his swimming speedo like underwear while teasing where he had it hidden on him to the point where he was now twirling it around his index finger by only it&#39;s strap, this made you blush and wondered where he hid his room keys.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ah...do you usually hide things in there?&quot; You asked, unaware that Lily was looking from afar right now. Gathering up and carrying your things that Ordon shortly answered, saying that it&#39;s only the things he needs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only my essentials items. Why, is there something wrong with the idea that I carry some of my things around while looking like a hansom fur model? He asked that you decided to drop the subject for the way he said it was making you turn on while feeling embarrassed by a question about him carrying his things in his swimming speedo like underwear, even if you wanted Ordon here to be your fur model of a man to be around with.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I think we should just go to your room, for now that is. It&#39;s just that. ...ugh! I just need to be somewhere a bit more private right now, especially since I&#39;m going to be with you to the room that is!&quot; You said as you groaned about it, blushing about it even for you were still embarrassed by the fact that you were still female.<br />
<br />
With this as Ordon was surprised to hear you wanting to be with him in his own room, Ordon paused for he suddenly understand what was going on through your mind and nodded that he then spoke up to you about what to do next for your first night. &quot;Alright. It&#39;s probably for the best that I help you get settled in on your first night anyways, but it&#39;s only if you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, Ordon walks up to you and gently puts his hand on your shoulder as he looks down with a warm smile that you felt comforted by this to the point enough of even cracking up a small smile of your own while you&#39;ve both wagged your tails some. You didn’t know why for you felt so much more comfortable around Ordon right now, rather than being afraid of him that you both began to kiss. Strange, normally if you would encounter a hulking strong guy with a bulging big dick that you would run. so why didn&#39;t you, especially considering your current body you&#39;re now in?<br />
<br />
Not realizing that you were pawing yourself while feeling emotionally charmed by him, Ordon did cared about you as this is what counted at the moment. Seeing what you were doing, he quietly lifted you off your feet as he was now holding you in his arms that he was more like a knight carrying a princess on his noble sted. Lily was seeing the show as Ordon was ready to rush away to the hall and towards the elevators that Lily was enjoying his company at the time. &quot;Well Niixa, good luck. Behave to both you and Ordon, my beloved brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
C&#39;mon now, let’s get going now.&quot; Ordon exclaimed as you nodded to him for he then rushes towards the elevators, after running down the hall that at the time. you were holding his hands while he was really moving, like he was on the run to get somewhere fast that he was unaware of you blushing with both embarrassment and the way he was holding you for when he swiftly took off your feet and into his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you feel? Hmm, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; Ordon asked as you paused to answer that he then looks down on you to see your flustering red-faced as you tilted your head to give him a puzzled look. &quot;Ah...&quot; This somehow turned his face red as he then realized to what he had done that to everyone else&#39;s sight, he was his wife on vacation with him now. &#39;c, crap. I probably could&#39;ve of taken her to my room some other way! Why did I decided to carry her out like a princess?!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... s, sorry about that. I Didn’t think things through.&quot; Ordon said, now feeling embarrassed by this as he slowed down from his wife to a paste.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, you were just trying to be nice. Don’t worry about it, I get it. Uless, you ment something else?&quot; You said, still red in the face.<br />
<br />
Um, well... you looked a little nervous back there and....I was wondering if you felt alright is all. With that....  shall we?&quot; He exclaimed, containing as you paused to look down at your body and sighed as you watched your breasts bounce with each step he took while holding you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just not used to this yet, I don&#39;t think that I&#39;ll even will get usedto this actually.&quot; You exclaimed while Ordon looked down at your body and smiled at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well then, I can see where this is going. once we to the room, how about we talk about this? I&#39;ll even help you adjust.&quot; Ordon said that you look up at him and nodded to him while you hold on to him for comfort as he walked.<br />
<br />
Ordon chuckled abit at this for the two of you continued walking down the hall. Shortly after, other anthros began to notice you being carried around by Ordon. Seeing you being carried around by Ordon caused a chat among the other anthros of the Island, that&#39;s where the rumors started to spread.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Two anthrs asked while they looked, when another beings to ask and take notice of you with Ordon. &quot;Hey, look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of them were now gossiping about you and Ordon, especially to what they was saying about him. Some were good things about how awesome he was at his job, but one caught your raccoon ears for you over heard what one was saying that this made you embrace to hide in his strong furry hyena arms. &quot;Hay, isn&#39;t that our Ordon&#39;s girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ordon, you big bummy!&quot; You yelled at Ordon, feeling more embarrassed by what they were now thinking about the two match makers you are. Ordon did got the message as he payed no attention from them, but how could he for his face was red to when he heard you.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry...I didn’t mean for this to happen. I&#39;m sorry regardless.&quot; He said as he now felt ashamed by all of this.<br />
<br />
As you both reached to the point of the elevators, a furry anthro polar bear stop him for a chat. &quot;Hey, Ordon. I had no idea that you had a girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girlfriend?!&quot; You asked, shocked. he called you his girlfriend, when you haven&#39;t begun to even date with him just yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Sir, What are you talking about?&quot; Ordon asked, trying to clear the air of any misunderstandings.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, rumors about Ordon dating you has already begun to spread. It was then that a red fox, an orange tiger, and a oryx gazelle began talking to him as well. You didn&#39;t get a chance for their names as you went on by what they were for when they each spoke.<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic oryx gazelle : he seemed to be on the right of the three. &quot;wait a minute, your dating?&quot;<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic orange tiger: enjoying the view as he in the middle of the three. &quot;You&#39;ve should&#39;ve told us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ordon, the anthro hyena tried to clear things up with them. However, they weren&#39;t listening to what he was saying. &quot;H, hey...&quot;<br />
<br />
You even tried to say something as well, even if you were being held up in his arms for the misunderstanding look. Being a female anthro raccoon by the name Niixa was one thing, but being in a mistake mess like this was a turn over. &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic red fox: he was basically to the left of the tiger of the three. &quot; I didn&#39;t know that you were so lovey-dovey that you&#39;d would bring her here on this vacational island trip with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ordon was standing to get flustered by this, even if the three were seeing this as his love date with you. &quot;Wait, Wait, Wait, Wait! That&#39;s not it! You&#39;ve got the wrong idea!&quot;<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic red fox: seeing this as Ordon&#39;s denial, he told him that there&#39;s no denying true love feelings for anothers heart. &quot;It’s rude to deny your relationship in front of others! Just go ahead and admit it already.&quot;<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic oryx gazelle: &quot;it&#39;s alright Ordon. Besides, we give you our blessings!&quot;<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic orange tiger: turning to the crowd, as if  to see anyone else agreed to this. &quot;Right, everyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; everybody said that it was ok with them. This was making you feel abit uncomfortable for you shortly decided to do what any body would think of in a situation like this, and that was to pinch him in his left arm tightly.<br />
<br />
This did hurt him to even scream out loud. looking back down to you with a worried sight in his, his asked  you why and about your grip. &quot;Why did you do that?! and what kind of monster grip do you have?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;seriously, I&#39;m sorry already!&quot; Someone of an anthro said in the crowd that you&#39;ve over hear one say. Though, it did sounded happy for the both of you.<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic oryx gazelle: &quot;they&#39;re all flirty with each other!&quot; Seeing to what the two of you in action of a show.<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic orange tiger: &quot;Ordon looks so happy with her.&quot; Almost sounding like he was pleased for him.<br />
<br />
The anthromorphic red fox: &quot;yeah. Yes he does.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a struggle, but some time after is where you and Ordon finally approached his room that he was kindly enough to set you down as he then unlocked it by using his key card on the sender. Once unlocked, he then held the door open for you to go inside first that you smiled at Ordon&#39;skind gesture and walked into his room as you thenbegan looking around at where you were staying in. Ordon soon entered as he shortly joined you, after locking the door while hanging the do not disturb sign out that the first thing he did was walk up to you and holds you from the back.<br />
<br />
Feeling Ordon do this made you smile up at him and nuzzled him closely, while observing your resort suite. First, there were two large lamps placed by two palm trees on one side of the room with an additional two smaller lamps to the sides of a queen sized bed while the bed was neatly made and had ornate looking pillows that there were a few empty shelves to the side with the palm trees were at as a flat screen TV was placed on a shelf in front of the bed and between the two lamps with the trees. The remote was laying on the left side desk top of the bed as there was then a couch placed adjacent to a sliding glass door, which lead out to a balcony that overlooked the resort as a hammock hung just across the couch while overhearing the balcony&#39;s side. This was all to the side of the bed that you didn&#39;t hear to what Ordon said, till he placed his hands on your shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think? is this place perfect for us?&quot; Ordon asked as you paused and walked up to the sliding glass door when you then noticed that there were curtains for it for you simply pulled them in front of the door while flushing out any outside light, and possible attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s perfect. Alright, is this ok for you?&quot; You said as you sat down on the couch, looking down at your body.</p>
