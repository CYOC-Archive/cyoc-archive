<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You read the details on the pork special: a full rack of ribs, pork roll, pineapple glazed ham, smoked bacon, and pork chops. You know that you could never eat all of this, but you might enjoy the leftovers. &quot;I&#39;ll have the Pork Special and a large soda,&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, coming right up,&quot; Your waitress goes to the back and delivers your order. You wait a while, mind drifting off. You think about the succulent meat you&#39;ve ordered. You imagine devouring the bacon and pork roll. You can see the ribs, meat falling off of the bone. You can smell the tangy barbecue sauce. You can... feel drool. <br />
<br />
You snap back to your senses, wiping your face on your sleeve. You look around to see if your food is coming, not yet. You put your head in your hands, resting. You&#39;re glad to be sitting after spending all day at work on your feet and walking through the zoo to get here. Your legs ache. You rub them with your hands. You massage until your arms and hands ache. Overall, you feel worse; your whole body is aching, now. You lean back in your seat, just trying to rest. However, your food is here. You look back at the table and see your waitress unloading plates of food. Steam rises from the bacon, pork roll, ribs, pork chops, and ham. You lick your lips at the sight.  &quot;Enjoy,&quot; and your waitress walks off. You pick up a knife and fork and saw into the juicy ham steak. You place some pineapple on your bite and you bring in your first piece of heaven. The ham and pineapple juices hit your taste buds and explode. Never before in your life have you tasted something so... vibrant! You feel instant relief in your muscles. Your whole body feels as though you could take on the world. Then, the feeling fades. Your aching returns, your mouth becomes plain again, and your smile fades from your face. <br />
<br />
You look at the food with new eyes. This food, it provides relief from your aching and has incredible flavor. You need to keep eating. You cut up more bites and swallow each immediately after cutting it. You fall into a rhythm: cut, chew, swallow, repeat. You keep chugging along until you&#39;ve eaten the entire ham steak. You sit there with juice running on your chin; you wipe it off with your napkinand groan. Your aching muscle bite back at you. Your hunger doubles despite your small food baby. You set the ham plate aside and pull up the pork chops. You eagerly start slicing into the tender meat. You get a bit of extra gravy off of the plate onto your bite. You close your mouth around it and meet the same awe as before. So many people mess up pork and overcook it until it feels like tough shoeleather in your mouth, but the chef has made this pork perfectly. You find no trouble chewing it up and downing it.<br />
<br />
You waste no time cutting larger bites and biting them off of your fork in large portions. You becomw so focused upon eating that you don&#39;t notice your clothes seem to shrink slightly. Gravy streams from the corner of your stuffed mouth. You shirt rides up on your beer belly. Small moobs begin to sag on your gut, and lovehandles start to widen your frame. &quot;Ahh...&quot; You finish your pork and stack the plate on the ham plate. Next is the bacon and pork roll. You feel so euphoric that you pay no mind to your body or manners. You grab handfuls od bacon and shovel them into your widening mouth. Your once angular face becomes broad and soft. Your gut swells until your shirt can only hold in your flabby moobs, but even that will change. Your thick arms start to gain form. Muscle inflates beneath your layers of fat. Your pecs grow and perk up. Your nipples become wide and profound on them. Your gut becomes hard with muscle. Your fingers become like sausages. Your thighs press together, tearing seams on your pants. Your ass becomes hard with muscle before turning round and bulbous with fat. The seat of your pants finally tears, revealing your stressed underwear. By now, you&#39;ve finished the plate of porkroll and bacon, wiping your wet face with your greasy hand. It&#39;s then that you finally notice your changes.<br />
<br />
You bring a hand before your face, looking at the thick appendige. You bring a hand to one of your beefy biceps. Your hand can make it about halfway around, and your hand is very big. You admire the strong look of it. You could easily out-do any strongman on earth. You look down at your naked legs, covered only by tight underwear. You look at your massive bulge, imagining your improvements in that department. You tear your eyes away from yourself and back to your food. Your stomach rumbles for more, despite the fact that you&#39;ve already eaten several meals&#39; worth of food. You drag over the ribs and preemptively chug down half of your drink. The cool liquid slides down your throat. It bubbles in your gut, foretelling major gas. You then take the entire rack of ribs in your hands.<br />
<br />
You tear all of the meat off. You take the tender meat in your hands and stuff it into your mouth. Barbecue sauce coats your hands and face. You rudely lick it off. You down more and more meat. All of it goes to your muscles. Your arms bulge, despite the loss of definition to fat. Your sausage fingers look more like giant hot dogs. After your muscles grow, you feel tingling in many places on your body. The tingling on your face is all across your jaw line and sideburns. From it sprouts thick tufts of dark brown hair. The tufts form together, creating a full, short beard that spans down your sideburns all across your square jaw. The hair on your head turns messy and rugged, but handsome. Your eyebrows become very thick as well. All of it is short, and it suits you very well. You stroke your luscious beard as the tingling on your chest and in your armpits grows. Thick tufts of brown hair sprout under your arms, growing to about two inches long. Your chest hair forms wide atop your moobs and slowly thins down to your belly button, stopping. This hair is like your beard in length. Hair grows all along your arms, turning them into furry beasts. <br />
<br />
Most exciting is just below your belly button. Dark brown hair sprouts and spreads, as long as your chest hair, wide down to your crotch, forming a burly treasure trail. You feel the hair beneath your underwear, turning your crotch into a forest of manliness. Your legs adopt thick hair all the way to the tops of your hairy feet. You look over yourself, licking your lips at your new lumberjack look. Your waitress returns, &quot;Enjoying the food?&quot; You respond in a voice much lower than your own, &quot;It&#39;s great, could I get the soup of the day?&quot; <br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; She delivers your order, and you return to examining yourself. You happily down the rest of your drink, more bubbles growing in your stomach. The bubbles rise in your throat, large and fit to burst. They breach your throat and you burp very loudly. You laugh and smack your gut. A real man&#39;s burp, that was! You rest your hand on your gut and slide it down to your waist. You must be two and a half feet wide. You can&#39;t help but be happy as a big daddy like this. You slide your hand into your pants to fondle your new package. Your hand wraps around something as thick as a beer can. You run a thumb up the shaft until your find the head. Your cock is definitely as long as a beer can (Minus the head). You rub your thumb on your thick head. You stroke the mushroom tip and accidentally cum in your hand. You bring your hand to your face and sniff, breathing deep your spunk. You then lick it up, savoring the salty-sweet taste of it.<br />
<br />
Your waitress comes back with a steaming bowl of something brown. &quot;Today&#39;s special is pig pen, enjoy,&quot; You sniff the bowl. You enjoy the meaty scent wafting into your nose. You enjoy it so much that you don&#39;t bother with a spoon; you just lift the bowl and start chugging. The slop gets on your face and in your beard, falling down your throat. You tilt back your head to get the last drops. You breathe out heavily in satisfaction. You put down the bowl as you feel new changes coming on.<br />
<br />
First to ache are your teeth and nose. Your gums slowly push out large tusks from your lower canines. These grow up around your upturned nose. Your nose pushes forward a bit and starts turning brown. Your tusks grow until they hug your snout high on both sides. After that, your ears become pointed and shift a bit close on either side of your messy hair. With that, your skin starts turning brown from your snout. Coarse hairs follow the color. It travels down your thick neck to your broad, hairy chest. From your moobs to your belly, the brown is darker, but not as dark as your hair. Your nipples becomw the same rich brown as your big belly. This color continues into your crotch. There, it ends under your swollen balls. Your head becomes an even darker brown than your belly, wet and defined. The lighter brown crawls down your tree trunk legs to your feet, where the brown become darker again. This same effect happens to your giant hands. Above your round ass, you feel a pressure. This pressure grows in your tailbone. It builds and builds until an tail pops out. It stretches less than a foot before its end is topped with a big tuft of dark brown hair. Now, after all of your changes, you are a complete boar man. Your waitress returns with a check and hands it to you.  You reach into the tattered remains of your pants to retrieve your wallet. You produce all of the necessary money along with a tip. You get up from your chair, feeling your dramatically increased weight, but it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s slowing you or weakening you much. On the contrary, you feel very big and powerful in your newer -- and taller -- strongman form. You walk over to the exit in your bulging underwear, bathing happily in the stares you get. You get to the exit and notice something you hadn&#39;t seen before: a scale! You instantly get excited seeing it; you want eagerly to know how much this giant body weighs. You step onto it, smiling as it creak under you. You watch the number go up in front of you. 150. 200. 250. 300. 350. 400. 423. Wow! You&#39;re 423 pounds of meat (Pork?)! You chuckle in your baritone voice at your impressive weight. You step off, eliciting creaks of relief from the scale. You walk out of the restaurant, satsified with this new body. You then...</p>
