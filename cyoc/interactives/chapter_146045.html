<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sheafs and reams of paper surrounded Henry. Some crumpled and discarded at his feet. Some spread out over the tamp table at his side. Some he had thrown into the fire that crackled between him and his daughter.<br />
<br />
Jess sat in her armchair across from him, eyes dead-set, serious, unwavering, answering every question he had put to paper.<br />
<br />
This was insane...<br />
<br />
A cursed Cabin, with actual magic, was turning his family into animals. Animals that they inadvertently chosen when they spoke their names out loud. <br />
<br />
His daughter was becoming a cow.<br />
<br />
His son a horse.<br />
<br />
And his wife, Jess wasn&#39;t 100%, but guessed a Goat. <br />
<br />
Oh God his wife... He still hadn&#39;t seen her since, Jess told him she was sleeping and that it would be better explain everything first.<br />
<br />
This entire thing was insane. It couldn&#39;t be. Yet...<br />
<br />
Hours and hours he had trudged through the woods, looking for the road and the path that just last night had been a ten/fifteen minute walk away. There had to be something to that. It couldn&#39;t be normal. He scribbled again.<br />
<br />
&#39;Who lives here then?&#39; The sheet said as he handed it over to his daughter.<br />
<br />
She took it, righting it, eyes flicking across the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;No-one I think. Us. I mean, from what it sounds like this Cabin doesn&#39;t belong to anyone. It just suits itself to whoever is staying in it. Until they...&quot; She trailed off.<br />
<br />
Turn into animals, she didn&#39;t need to say it. Henry&#39;s head sank again. He rubbed his hands on his eyes in frustration. Spots fading when he looked up, meeting Jess&#39;s concerned green eyes. She spoke again. &quot;You&#39;re safe though Dad! As long as you don&#39;t speak an animal&#39;s name, you won&#39;t start turning.&quot; She was doing her best to be helpful and hopeful, Henry could see that. Yet there she sat. His little girl, two humongous perverse breasts straining against a blouse and dungarees. Changed forever. It made him uncomfortable thinking about it. Both the implication of how changes were triggered, and that his little girl was infected with such a vile thing.<br />
<br />
&#39;Does it hurt?&#39; he wrote, turning so she could see. Her breath caught, she looked ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... It doesn&#39;t hurt at all...&quot; She responded in a maudlin tone. Jess&#39;s mind drifted back for a moment. It certainly didn&#39;t hurt. It felt better than anything she had ever felt, and she knew a part of her longed for that feeling, even now. That terrified her more than anything.<br />
<br />
Henry for his part could see that there was more than met the eye from her answer, but he didn&#39;t press. He had already asked about the change. What triggered it, and in a fool rush, had asked Jess what she had done. Red faced his daughter shook her head and didn&#39;t answer. He knew better than to push.<br />
<br />
&#39;What do we do now?&#39; He wrote finally, after a several minute silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Dad. You should keep mum. I&#39;d even advise some sort of gag to make sure you don&#39;t say anything by accident. Then...<br />
Well, you&#39;re the only one unaffected. Maybe there is something you can do. Find a way out? Get help? I don&#39;t know.&quot; Her voice was soft, re-assuring, but frightened. Henry felt for his little girl. She was trying to be so brave. For him. For her family.<br />
<br />
He wanted to comfort her. Tell her everything would be okay. Protect his little girl. He reached over and cupped her face with his hand, thumb rubbing her cheek.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, Jess felt like a little girl again. Comforted. Loved. Taken care of. Sitting on her father&#39;s lap as he told her stories. Watching in wonder at this man who towered over her, telling the most fantastical tales of adventure and romance. Big hands turning page after page, ruffling her hair, drifting...<br />
<br />
Drifting...<br />
<br />
Hands drifting down. To her neckline. Her shoulder. Arms. Chest. Pressing. Dipping further. To her most private place. Tingling<br />
<br />
Back in the room Jess left a tear slide from her eye. The Cabin was debasing most sacred memories to her. Perverting even innocent memories. The heat was rising in her loins. She couldn&#39;t let it win. Gently she placed her hand over her father&#39;s and leaned her face into it more, just for a moment. &quot;Thank you!&quot; she mumbled before pulling it free of her cheek. Tears now streaming down she peeled free and stood up.<br />
<br />
Henry leaned back and watched as the globes of flesh writhed and jiggled as Jess stood, finally falling with gravity and straining against the dungarees, making the straps dig into her slim shoulders. Jess, feeling his eyes roam around her body felt excitement. Excitement and shame. She shouldn&#39;t be feeling this. She had to leave quickly. She turned and muttered. &quot;Goodnight Dad. Love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you too!&quot; She heard him say. Wheeling around eyes wide, she pressed her fingers to her lips. &quot;Careful Dad!&quot; she hissed, &quot;Or are you so eager to get one of these???&quot; Taking her tail in hand, she swung it at him, furry end *whooshing* gently through the air. Henry&#39;s eyes cast down, again watching the tail.<br />
<br />
Jess again felt excitement at her father&#39;s eyes upon her. She felt desired. Even though nothing in his eyes betrayed lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to feel it...&quot; The voice squeaked from her before she could stop it. <br />
<br />
Henry, dumbstruck, nodded. He needed to make this real. To see that this all wasn&#39;t just some elaborate joke. If he could put his hands on it, he could put the disbelief to bed. He watched as his daughter turned and stepped backward toward him. The tail hung limply from a slit in the pants. He could see it close up now, for the first time, flickering firelight casting shadows and dancing colour across it.<br />
<br />
It was pale, and kind of bony looking. The same pale as his daughter&#39;s skin. The end though, that was a bush of auburn hair. A deep reddy brown. It looked strange. Not at all like the hair on her head.<br />
<br />
A trembling hand went out, fingers grazing the hair. It felt softer than it looked, though not near as soft as normal head hair felt. He stroked it next, feeling the hairs run against his fingers. The tail flicked for a moment, snaking above his hand and landing draped over his wrist. It felt warm. Almost hot to the touch.<br />
<br />
Jess, facing away from her father, stood with eyes jammed shut. Every fibre of her being railed and screamed to stay straight and narrow. To not turn this perverse as the cabin would want her to. As her body was screaming at her to. She could feel her womanhood already slick and swelling with blood.<br />
<br />
The tail around Henry&#39;s hand twitched again. Landing higher up his arm and then gently pressing, drawing his arm in. Henry&#39;s hand twisted, now holding the appendage near the base, feeling it running along the length of his arm. Looking up he saw it disappear into the slit in her pants. How did it look, he wondered, where it met skin, where it was attached. His hand drifted up. Rubbing Jess&#39;s lower back and down onto where the tail poked out.<br />
<br />
Jess felt the hand. So strong. So warm and comforting. He needed to see. She needed him to see.<br />
<br />
Excitement rising like never before her hands went up.<br />
<br />
*Click*... *Click*.<br />
<br />
She undid the two buckles for her dungarees straps. Instant relief on the dug in straps on her shoulders. She didn&#39;t try to catch the front as it fell away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jess...&quot; Henry said behind her. He seemed confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sssshh Dad... You need to see. I know. To make this real. It&#39;s okay...&quot;. she coo&#39;d. She would show him. Let him see. Make this real for him. Then he would know the risk.<br />
<br />
Arms at her side she tugged at the dungarees. It didn&#39;t take much for them to loosen and fall to the floor, tail sliding through the cut, Jess didn&#39;t exactly have a curvy bum or anything to catch the fabric.<br />
<br />
Henry gasped. Not at seeing the tail fully now, that was shocking enough, but that his little girl had disrobed in front of him with no underwear underneath. Venus dimples and two tight globes of pale flesh framed the joining of tail and back, of animal and man.<br />
<br />
Jess was on fire.  she exposed herself so readily to her father. Her face burned. Cheeks aflame and ears likely to catch fire. She wanted him to touch her. She wanted to touch herself. <br />
<br />
Right now. To play her fingers, to wiggle her ass and fuck her dad... Maybe she could<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess!&quot; She heard her father call, &quot;Your ears!?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hands flew to her ears. She gasped as she felt the skin taught, growing, bristly hairs underneath, pushing through. What was she doing? She was trying to get off with her dad!? Changing here in front of him already. I a moment of clarity and sanity she knew she had to flee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go Dad!&quot;. She bent and picked up her dungarees, keeping her back to him. Henry for his part turned away, but not before he saw her taut cheeks spread while picking up the pants.<br />
<br />
Image seared unwillingly to his mind he looked down as his daughter retreated from the room. For a moment, he had almost extended his hand to touch his daughters ass. This place made him ill.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Jess rushed up the stairs, naked from the waist down. Entering the bedroom she saw James asleep on his bed, facing away from her. Good, the bathroom was free. Time for a cold, cold shower to get rid of these ears...</p>
