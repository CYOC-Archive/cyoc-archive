<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About 10 seconds later, he started to feel a tingling all over his body.  Jack got up out of the chair and ran over to the mirror on the back of Pat&#39;s bedroom door.  The change began with him shrinking down to 5 feet.  He felt his bones restructuring to fit his new height, an uncomfortable, but not overly painful feeling.  Jack guessed that with huge changes like this, the program dulled the pain of restructuring, which could be debilitating to the subject.  Next, he felt really itchy all over as all the hair on his body retracted into his skin. Even his eyebrows were gone.  Next, his skin turned gray, starting at the crown of his head and spreading from there.  As the color spread out over his body, his features started to change.  He felt a slight headache come on as his head expanded to alien proportions. His eyes turned black and expanded, giving him a much wider field of view and the ability to see both infrared and ultraviolet light.  His ears folded back and melted into his skin, but he could still hear, apparently.  His nose flattened and disappeared, only his nostrils - which were now only two small slits in the middle of his face - left behind.  His lips disappeared, his mouth now a line across the bottom of his face.  He smiled, revealing very sharp teeth, and when he moved his tongue around he felt a second row of them.  Jack&#39;s neck lengthened and became much skinnier, feeling a strange tingling sensation as two more voice boxes grew in.  His arms suffered the same fate as his neck, growing longer and skinnier, and his pinkie finger retracted into his hand.  The rest of his fingers grew skinnier and smaller, and the tips of his fingers became spherical.  He then felt a sucking sensation down in his nether region as his equipment retracted into his body, leaving a smooth surface.  His legs became skinny and his feet shrunk, his toes merging, which left his as one solid mass.  Next, Jack felt something growing out of his head.  He saw that in the mirror that it was the fleshy antenna.  Finally, his clothes and shoes all merged together and changed into a skintight, shiny silver spacesuit.  Memories manifested in his mind as he remembered controlling people with the frequency emitted from his antenna and using the many functions of his computer.<br />
<br />
Pat looked at his friend-turned-alien, his eyes wide.  He just stared at the creature that used to be Jack before he felt a weight drop in his left pocket.  He reached into his pocket and took out something that looked a bit like an iPad, only it didn&#39;t have a button.  He was confused as to what it was until he looked at what Jack had written in the &quot;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION&quot; text box.  &quot;So it&#39;s a translation computer,&quot; he said to himself. He heard Jack say something in a strange language and text popped up on the screen that said, &quot;YES, IT IS.  EARTHLINGS CANNOT UNDERSTAND OUR ADVANCED LANGUAGE, THEREFORE I HAD TO GIVE YOU THIS DEVICE HERE.&quot;  Pat chuckled and said, &quot;you&#39;re having a lot of fun with this, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  The thing that used to be Jack nodded emphatically and spoke again.  The text said &quot;YOU BET YOU&#39;RE ASS I AM.  DUDE, YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA HOW AWESOME THIS IS.&quot;  Pat read the screen and then asked his alien friend, &quot;what can that form of yours do?&quot;  Jack smiled and spoke again.  The screen said, &quot;AS YOU SAID TO ME BEFORE, EARTHLING, LET ME SHOW YOU.&quot;  A strained look came over Jack&#39;s face, as if he was concentrating really hard.  Pat saw that the top of his antenna started to glow with a strange white light and quiver back and forth very fast.  Pat felt his mind grow cloudy...and then it went almost completely blank, the only thing remaining in it an overwhelming desire to obey the creature in front of him.  Pat was now only a drone, designed to follow its master&#39;s every command.  &quot;Grovel at my feet, earthling,&quot; Pat heard a voice say.  Compelled to obey, Pat walked toward the source of the voice, got down on his knees, and lay prostrate in worship.  &quot;play with your tail like a kitten would.&quot;  Pat complied, rolling around on his back with his tail in his hands, his blank expression unchanging.  &quot;Stop,&quot; said the voice.  Pat stopped, his body seemingly frozen in time.  Suddenly, the fog lifted, and Pat could think for himself again.  <br />
<br />
He sat up and looked at Jack.  &quot;What the hell was THAT?!&quot;  Pat heard the alien chuckle and say something.  Pat looked at the screen and saw that it said, &quot;A SPECIAL ABILITY OF MINE.  I CAN MAKE ANY EARTHLING FOLLOW MY EVERY COMMAND WITHOUT QUESTION BY EMITTING A SPECIAL FREQUENCY FROM MY ANTENNA.&quot;  Pat shook his head in wonder.  &quot;Shit, man, remind me not to piss you off when you&#39;re in this form.&quot;  Jack chuckled again and said one word.  Pat saw that the screen said &quot;NOTED.&quot;  Pat put down the computer and asked Jack, &quot;mind if I join you?&quot;  Jack shook his head, smiling and talking.  &quot;I THOUGHT YOU&#39;D NEVER ASK, PAT.&quot;  Pat chuckled at that.  &quot;Do your stuff, bro.  Make me like you.&quot;  Pat saw Jack give a sideways smile and pick up a handheld computer and start typing on it.  After about 20 seconds of Jack&#39;s tapping Pat said, &quot;Hey Jack...&quot; the alien looked up from what he was doing and looked at him questioningly.  &quot;What do you say we go whole hog with this thing, making it permanent and altering reality with it?  Like, the aliens could&#39;ve come in and conquered earth...and aren&#39;t the most benevolent of rulers.  People would hate doing their jobs in service of us and therefore we would have to control them en masse.  Even the lowest alien would be above the highest human.  The two of us could be the twin offspring of the emperor and would be almost inseparable.  You dig?&quot;  Jack mulled it over for a few seconds before smiling and nodding.  Jack went back to typing and before long was finished.  &quot;One more thing, though,&quot; Pat said before his soon-to-be-twin-brother could click &quot;SAVE ALL CHANGES&quot;.  Jack said something that had an upward inflection at the end of it.  Pat&#39;s computer read &quot;WHAT&#39;S UP?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s make our height six-foot-six and the spacesuits jet-black.  Your current appearance isn&#39;t all that intimidating to be honest.&quot;  Jack thought about that then nodded in agreement, making the adjustments as he did so.  When he was finished, he clicked &quot;SAVE ALL CHANGES&quot;</p>
