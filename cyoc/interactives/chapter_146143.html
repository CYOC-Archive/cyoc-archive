<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I honestly have no idea Eileen,” Ty laughed. “I mean what do you do with a pocket sized teenage girl in your shirt pocket?”<br />
<br />
“Well when I was your age,” Eileen stated, placing her hands on her miniature hips. “When a boy like a girl they would introduce you to their family. I’m not some hussy you can just have your way with you know, or is that how you see me?”<br />
<br />
“Of, Of course not,” Ty stammered, blushing fiercely as he gazed a the nude teen in his pocket. “I, um, I just...Well, I didn’t think of us as, well, together.”<br />
<br />
Eileen felt her cheeks burn as she averted her eyes from the giant Ty. The idea of her being the girlfriend of this teenage boy was impossible. Eileen was a 40 year old house wife with a daughter not much older than Ty. If anything Eileen was almost a motherly figure to him. However, things were not normal. Eileen was now 15 years old and maybe 4 inches tall, stuck in the pocket of lonely teenage boy with god like powers. Part of her wanted to be reasonable, adult like, and tell Ty that they had their fun it was over. The other part though, the part that seemed to be getting louder, was telling Eileen she should enjoy this. Ty had given her her youth back. Ty cared greatly for her. Ty treated her kindly and with more love and respect than she had received from grown men who knew better. As much as Eileen did not want to admit it, she liked the idea of being in a relationship with Ty.<br />
<br />
“Ty,” Eileen sighed, her voice barely audible. “As crazy as it sounds, as awkward and insane as it is, yes. I can say that yes, we are together.”<br />
<br />
Ty felt his jaw go slack as he gazed down at Eileen. He had a girlfriend. While true Eileen was usually old enough to be his mom, his powers had allowed him to bring her to his level. They were both teenagers now, meaning it could be possible for them to be together. Turning, he smiled down at Eileen as he saw the girl shift nervously inside his pocket. “Your right,” he smiled. “We are, besides I mean we already...Well...um, you know.”<br />
<br />
Eileen giggled girlishly up at Ty nodding in response. “Yeah we did,” she grinned. “And don’t you forget it. I’m not the kind of girl that just sleeps around. I have to really like you for that to happen.”<br />
<br />
As Ty and Eileen now exited her house, Eileen was astounded by what she saw. The world looked the same, it was just that everything was sized up to gigantic proportions. Houses loomed like mountains to the 4 inch tall teen, while animals like birds, squirrels, and dogs looked like beasts of monstrous legend. Eileen ducked down slightly in Ty’s pocket, somewhat frightened by what she saw. “You okay Eileen,” Ty whispered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Eileen nodded. “It’s just, everything is so big. It’s so strange, and a little scary.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll protect you,” Ty said warmly. Eileen looked up, smiling at the teen as they now entered Ty’s home. As Ty entered his house, he immediately heard his stepmother yell for him. “Where have you been,” June yelled. Ty walked towards his stepmom, a sheepish look on his face as he gazed at the grumpy middle age woman. “Sorry mom,” he said quietly. “I was just going for a walk.”<br />
<br />
June huffed, pushing her dull blond hair behind her ears as she stared at Ty. “There’s still chores to do,” she said. “I need you to finish weeding the garden and then the cars need to be washed. After that I need your help tidying up inside. My book club is coming over later this afternoon and I will not have this house looking like a mess.”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Ty said quietly. “But can I have something to eat first, I’m kind of hungry.”<br />
<br />
June narrowed her eyes as she glared at him. “I made some lunch earlier,” she said coldly. “It’s in the kitchen. It’s probably cold by now but help yourself. Then get to work on those chores, I don’t want to be embarrassed in front of my friends.” Ty nodded quietly as he made his way into the kitchen. June had cooked up some grilled cheese sandwiches earlier, which despite being cold were still quite good. As Ty now ate quietly, Eileen looked out of his pocket, glaring at June before turning up towards Ty.<br />
<br />
“Your mother is certainly a piece of work,” she grumbled. “Foster mom,” Ty said quietly. “June and Mark took me in awhile back. Never knew my real parents.”<br />
<br />
“Do they always work you so hard,” Eileen asked to which Ty nodded. “Yeah I have to do a lot of chores around the house,” he said. “June is obsessed with the place looking neat and clean. She’s always been worried about her appearance, probably goes back to her childhood. She talks about how she was the prettiest, most popular girl in school when she was a kid. She’s mild compared to Mark though, he’s scary.”<br />
<br />
“Has he hit you,” Eileen asked in alarm. Ty winced, nodding slowly as he chewed his grilled cheese. “Yeah couple of times,” He mumbled. “Guess he was the big football star back in high school. Him and June got married shortly after high school. They thought the world was there’s oyster, until they reality hit them in the face. June maybe be grumpy but she treats me way better than Mark. He sees how skinny and unathletic I am and I guess old high school memories flood back. He hits June too though, probably why she’s always wanting things neat and clean and pushing me around. She doesn’t want to feel his wrath either.”<br />
<br />
“That’s awful,” Eileen gasped. “You deserve better than that Ty, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay Eileen really,” Ty said. “I mean I don’t like Mark either and Dustin is a piece of work too. June may not be mother of the year but at least she doesn’t hit. She’s just cold.”<br />
<br />
“What she needs is a taste of her own medicine,” Eileen grumbled. Slowly Eileen’s eyes went wide as an idea began to form in her head. “Hmm, maybe she can.”<br />
<br />
Ty gave Eileen a confused look as Eileen grinned up and Ty, a mischievous look on her face.</p>
