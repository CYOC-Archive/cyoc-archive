<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth retrieved both boxes of vials from her closet and moved them to the table in her bedroom.  She brought her other torso up to the table to look at the vials, but on actually getting there and seeing just how many limbs she had in close proximity, she made eye contact with herself and moved one of her torsos over to the computer instead.<br />
<br />
She carefully took out the vials that interested her the most, given her current form: Gemini, Snake, Dragon, Human, Virgin.  She stopped pulling out vials at that point and pulled out a serving glass and the measuring cup.  Internal debate raged in Elizabeth&#39;s minds.  She hadn&#39;t been completely cognizant of the change as it happened, but as she had been adapting to her current form she had also gotten fairly used to thinking with 4 minds, which let her have 4 opinions.  And at the moment, those 4 opinions didn&#39;t exactly match up.  She recognized it as being the equivalent of indecision from back when she was single minded.  But viewed and experienced through the filter of multiple minds.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the computer, Elizabeth&#39;s other torso had coiled her tail up to make a much comfier and more snake-themed replacement for her old computer chair.  She put on some music, a bit louder than normal to hopefully drown out any sounds that would make Gina investigate.  Then started researching various zodiac signs.  In particular, she was very interested in Gemini, and whatever usefulness should could possibly glean from the internet.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth quickly externalized her internal debate in the hopes of helping her pick faster:<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m all agreed: I want more.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yess&quot; &quot;Yess&quot; &quot;Agreed&quot;<br />
&quot;More human?&quot;<br />
&quot;Another torsso!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not drink the whole vial?  Ssee what happens then&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to sstart with something less drasstic.&quot;<br />
&quot;Having 2 torsoss is amazing.  But I don&#39;t like how I&#39;m sso closely restricted.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah!  I want some more freedom.&quot;<br />
&quot;A large amount of Gemini.  But not the full vial.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yess&quot; &quot;Yess&quot;<br />
&quot;Add ssome ssnake.  Maybe it will make me longer.  More sspace between my torssoss.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oooh yess.&quot; &quot;I like it!&quot; &quot;Perfect!&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth grinned 4 times over.  Her little conversation had been completely pointless - she could have easily reached the decision purely in her minds.  But it was fun.  And fun was the whole point of transforming!<br />
<br />
She picked up the Gemini vial in one hand and carefully poured into the measuring cup.  She stopped filling when there was only 1/16th missing.  It was a small amount, just a couple of drops.  But Elizabeth knew that with magic like this, drops made huge differences.  She put that vial and all the others except the Snake back into their respective boxes and poured the mixture into the serving glass.  The serving glass was big enough to hold several doses of vial.  She picked up the Snake vial and thought about it.  A little measuring and she added 1/3 of the vial to the serving glass.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth&#39;s bedroom was as good a place as any for her next change.  She quickly pulled off both her tube tops and moved her torsos together on her bed.  She licked all 4 sets of lips in anticipation and picked up the cup.  Elizabeth glanced around between her heads, deciding which one should drink it.  She had no idea which was her original head, nor which she had longest.  They all felt the same to her.  She shrugged with her other arms and downed the drink with the head closest to the glass.  4 of her arms were already massaging her breasts in anticipation.<br />
<br />
It had a strong sweet and sour taste with faint hints of other flavors that faded out and in.  Almost instantly a dizzying warm sensation swept over her body.  Arousal followed moments later.  She was both prepared for and eagerly waiting for it.  She had already tightly entwined her torso&#39;s tails together and as the arousal washed over her, she tightly pressed her torsos together.  All 4 heads pressed forward into kisses, a sensation that was quickly becoming familiar to Elizabeth.  2 arms, 1 from each torso, found their way down to her pussies and sensually teased the area around them. <br />
<br />
With her 2 remaining arms Elizabeth reached behind her bed and pulled out her &quot;funtime box&quot;.  Two heads broke off kissing to look into the box, identical grins on their faces.  A couple seconds later, happy that she only needed 1 head to look at the box, the other head started nibbling on the first one&#39;s ear and kissing anywhere she could reach.  She dug through the box, looking for a very specific object while at the same time trying not to go to far with her teasing... But finding it impossible to hold back.<br />
<br />
Triumphantly she pulled it out of the box - a double dildo a friend had given her as a joke gift.  Now more appropriate than ever, its rattlesnake head diamond-shaped ends, banded coloring and rattler in the center were a perfect fit for the form Elizabeth had wrought.  The rattler sparked to life as she temporarily moved her torsos apart and jammed it into one pussy, then squished her torsos back together and guided it into her other pussy.<br />
<br />
She wrapped a midsection of her tail tightly around her waists, constricting them together and trapping the dildo inside her.  Gasps escaped her mouths and she started to gyrate, her torsos moving in near unison, pinned together at the waist by her incredibly strong tail.  A small idea flew into one of her minds and she flailed her tail around, hoping to amplify the pleasure she was generating as she thrust the dildo back and forth in her 2 cunts.  The sensations nearly knocked her out - her enormous snake tail of pure muscle tossed her lithe torsos around like they were made of feathers... And moved the dildo within her in ways she never could have otherwise.  She reached orgasm in a matter of seconds, then orgasm again a couple seconds later.  Then orgasm again several seconds after that, and another after that.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth gradually lost consciousness as the stacking orgasms overtook her minds.  By the time 3 of her minds had already lost consciousness, her 4th mind was too far gone under the waves of pleasure to think to stop thrashing herself around.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Elizabeth came to consciousness suddenly.  She was lying on the floor in the closet.  At least that was where her mind was located, and she was able to see and hear.  She had been woken by a sound - a rattler violently shaking.  She stretched and yawned then felt it.  Exhaustion, complete and total.  Not where her mind was, but in another part of her body.  And in another she felt raw unending waves of pleasure masking pain.  The waves started to overwhelm her mind.<br />
<br />
She remembered what she had done.  Panic rose up as she focused to made her tail stop thrashing.  The impulse to thrash had maintained when her other mind lost consciousness, and she found herself fighting herself.  Suddenly there was sweet relief as the muscles get their much deserved rest and she felt bedsheets against her backs.  But not the back of the torso she had woken up in.  Another torso.  Elizabeth was scared.  The other mind on her torso woke up.  2 more eyes to see the world with, another brain to be scared about what she had done to herself with.  She slowly slithered out of the closet and her jaws dropped.<br />
<br />
Everywhere she looked, she saw snake tail... <i>Her</i> snake tail.  Her tail was much bigger than before - instead of tapering down, it was now all the diameter of her torso, and there was a lot more of it.  She slowly slithered over the new carpet that was formed out of her enhanced body.  Her body had grown to the point that in many places she couldn&#39;t see the carpet because of her tail coiled up. Grins crossed her mouths as she slithered over her coils, both feeling the coils under her tail, and feeling her tail on her coils.<br />
<br />
She slithered over her coils to her bed and was relieved to find two torsos lying on their backs.  The rattler dildo lay between them.  Even just looking at her unconscious torsos Elizabeth could feel the pleasant throbbing of many stacked orgasms.  And the pain of having been unconsciously thrown around by her own tail for who knows how long.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth let out of a pair of sighs at her own stupidity and made a mental note to make sure not to do anything that dumb again in the future.  Or at least have a backup plan if she does.  Then a thought hit and she slithered over to the computer.  The clock said... 3:43 AM.  She&#39;d been flailing herself around all night.  She winced.  It was going to be a painful morning.  The idea of chugging a full human vial suddenly seemed like it wasn&#39;t too bad an idea.  But as she waited for her other minds to regain consciousness, the pain dwindled rapidly.  Far faster than the rate the orgasmic throbbing did.  And even though she wasn&#39;t actually feeling any actual orgasms, the aftershocks she felt coming from her other 2 torsos were more than pleasurable enough.<br />
<br />
She slithered back over to her bed and lay her new torso down between her 2 sleeping torsos.  Elizabeth wanted to explore her changed body, but she wanted to do it properly - fully awake!  As she dozed off, she happily imagined a 3-some between her 3 torsos.  She was happy... she had gotten her more, even if she wasn&#39;t able to fully experience it just yet.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Elizabeth came to consciousness lying face down on the linoleum in the kitchen.  Two pairs of eyes snapped open and two minds greeted the morning.  And Gina&#39;s foot in her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wake up.  What are you doing down there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth rolled over onto her back and Gina recoiled and turned away.  &quot;DAMMIT LIZ!  WEAR SOME DAMN CLOTHES!  Are you trying to become an exhibitionist or something?  If so, congratulations, you&#39;re doing an amazing job.  Why do I keep finding you naked...  I mean... I... You...&quot; <br />
<br />
Elizabeth looked up with 1 head at Gina as she stammered and turned away from Elizabeth.  Her other head looked down her front.  Yep, completely naked - breasts and pussy on fully display.  Oops.  She also saw a long and torso-diameter snake tail going from her waist straight to her bedroom door, which was held cracked open by the tail.  Now that she saw it, she realized she could feel the door pressing against her tail.<br />
<br />
Almost like doing a sit-up, she clenched her abs and rose into a standing pose.  And quickly slithered back towards her bedroom.  &quot;Sorry Gina!  I&#39;ll try to be better&quot; one head called back over her shoulder.  Her other mind wondered exactly what was happening to her.  She remembered waking up in the closet last night, rescuing her 2 original torsos and then going to sleep on the bed...  So how did she get to the kitchen?<br />
<br />
The answer, as it turned out, was very simple: she was in the kitchen all night long.  Elizabeth figured that out as soon as she slithered into her room and saw 3 torsos asleep on the bed.  She made sure she was out of sight of Gina, or at least her torso part was, and turned her heads inward and gave herself a quick celebratory kiss.  Not only had she successfully made more of herself, she had made 2 more torsos AND she was also long enough now to be in the bedroom <i>and</i> in the kitchen at once.  She checked the clock, and seeing it was 7:05 decided it was time she fully wake up and embrace her changed self.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth paused for a moment to collect her thoughts.  She was about to wake herself up.  An odd concept, and definitely one she hoped to explore more at a later date, but also one with plenty of potential.  She clearly remembered the mistake she made last night and gauged from the minor pain signals coming from two of the sleeping torsos that vaginal activities might be better avoided first thing this morning.  So she settled on a different plan of attack.<br />
<br />
She raised her torso up off the ground and then maneuvered her tail so she was being held level above the sleeping torsos, facing down towards the bed.  Elizabeth wouldn&#39;t have thought to try something like this yesterday, but after learning her tail was capable of thrashing 2 humanoid torsos around for 8+ hours on autopilot, she no longer questioned her tail&#39;s strength.  She slowly moved herself lower and lower so that her 2 conscious heads were upside-down and directly above sleeping heads on her thrashed torsos.  She positioned 2 of her arms over the middle (non-thrashed) torso&#39;s breasts, and her other 2 arms groped that torso&#39;s breasts.  Then moved herself just a little bit lower.<br />
<br />
Over the next 30 seconds, Elizabeth woke up in 6 more minds to some very pleasurable sensations.  4 of her heads were making out, and 2 pairs of her boobs were getting expertly groped and massaged.  Once all 8 minds were fully awake she shifted herself around, careful not to hurt her thrashed torsos and paired off her torsos into 2 sets of 2 each.  She proceeded to make out with herself, happily kissing, groping, tweaking nipples, and exploring herself.<br />
<br />
Her makeout session was interrupted when...</p>
