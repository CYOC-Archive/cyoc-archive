<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the night remained a bit of a blur, and I awoke cuddled up to Night from behind and had Terri on the other side of me. I then shivered a little and looked to see that the three of us were in the &quot;meat locker.&quot;  It amounted to a giant freezer and refrigerator, which Gabriel Harris kept most of the food he needed to be kept cold. There were several large cuts of meat hanging from various hooks from the ceiling. I could smell the meat, and it smelled quite tasty, though as I looked around, I soon saw that one of the pieces of meat looked as though something large had been stripping the flesh from the bones with nothing but claws and teeth. It&#39;s then that I remembered being a bit hungry the night before and moving to eat in the meat locker and then turning to other things<br />
<br />
&quot;Orrhhhm,&quot; I gave a groan and moved to gently move Terri&#39;s arm off of me. Doing so work her up and my groan did the same for night.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; Night asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I said weakly, still sounding groggy, &quot;probably shortly after dawn, like it was yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our first day as our own pack,&quot; Terri commented, giving a smile as she sat up and stretched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but we still need to officially divide Fangton between us and Devon&#39;s pack,&quot; Night spoke as she rolled over onto her other side place a hand on my back, &quot;and not to mention that we&#39;re going to need to be training John for the next few months until being a werewolf becomes second nature for him... and when his transformations on the full moon nights begin to lead to his secondary transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
I actually smiled at the mention of that. Terri had gone from being overweight to being extremely athletic and having a perfect hourglass figure that would probably make a good many woman jealous. David and Devon both looked highly muscular and looking like they were the perfect male specimens with equipment that presently left me rather jealous. But it did leave me looking forward to what would happen to me in time. However that daydream was soon replaced with the knowledge of what Devon had done and the responsibilities that I would have to take on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll come with me... to this meeting to divide Fangton?&quot; I asked, aimed to Night, but I wasn&#39;t looking to her and without my mentioning a name, it didn&#39;t make clear who I was talking to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have work today,&quot; Terri commented, &quot;and since my dad came back... I&#39;ll need to get back to my apartment and get things ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For you and Night to move in,&quot; Terri smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can come, though,&quot; Night answered, &quot;Devon will probably only recognize me as the other pack alpha, as that is what Tonya listed as part of her demands...&quot;<br />
<br />
That resulted in a sigh from me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t ask her to come with us,&quot; I said weakly, looking down and hoping that Terri and Night weren&#39;t mad at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Devon threw her out,&quot; Terri said after a moment, &quot;and she won&#39;t be with us all the time. So long as we remain human we can go anywhere in Fangton. Dividing the city is only for our wolf forms. We can&#39;t be in wolf form in Devon&#39;s part of Fangton.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming the police don&#39;t shoot him,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
No one said anything for a moment and Night got to her feet. She then turned and bent over to help me up. Once on my feet I looked back to where we had been laying. There on the floor was the obvious remains of the previous night&#39;s lovemaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to need to do some cleaning,&quot; I stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get ourselves cleaned first,&quot; Terri commented, &quot;I can deal with this before I leave for work... and you can ask dad for a spare set of clothes for today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
What followed was a rotation of showers and getting dressed. Terri apparently had enough spare sets of clean clothes to let Night put on a fresh set of clothes. David had brought a spare set of his own clothes and Gabriel did lend me some clothes to wear. Gabriel&#39;s clothes didn&#39;t fit me perfectly as they also felt a bit tight, but I couldn&#39;t really complain. Fred, Kevin and Tonya wore the same clothes they wore the day before, but they didn&#39;t have too much choice as to what the events that had happened the night before. While I sat at large table with some of the others, Terri was cleaning the mess we had made the night before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have school today?&quot; I asked to Tonya as we waited for Gabriel to return with plates of eggs and sausage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;it&#39;s an in service day. I&#39;ll wait and see on what happens with my folks and the cops first and then I&#39;ll go home and get changed. I expect you&#39;ll do EXACTLY as Night says when she and Devon divide Fangton?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll do what is necessary,&quot; I commented, &quot;though with the size of our Pack... having Alphas would only be a formality. I think we could manage to vote together on what we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s how we in Klawthorn handle things,&quot; David commented.<br />
<br />
Tonya didn&#39;t say anything in response, but I ultimately did hear a grumble. We then sat in quiet for a moment before Fred noticed a small television sitting in a corner on the kitchen counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think any police raid made the morning news?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
It was at this time that Gabriel returned carrying a pair a plates which he served to Night and myself.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might, and I suppose it wouldn&#39;t hurt to look,&quot; Gabriel commented, and while Night and I began eating, walked over to that television and switched it on, &quot;The local news should be starting by now...&quot;<br />
<br />
And it had started and by sheer luck, they were covering the subject that Fred was wondering about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fangton Police are presently looking for Devon and Jenni Lycos in connection with the murder of Francine Jones,&quot; said a field reporter who looked like he was standing outside a mansion, &quot;early this morning the police conducted a raid on their mansion on the south side of Fangton but found it abandoned. Questions and investigations on the location of their daughter Tonya Lycos will likely begin soon but for the moment the focus will be on Devon and Jenni Lycos. Now exact details of what the police are doing in their present manhunt, but if anyone knows where they are, it would be advisable that you contact the police and give them the information that you may have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll make officially dividing Fangton tougher,&quot; Night commented, &quot;If we&#39;re to meet him. They&#39;ll certainly have the Luna Corporation under surveillance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Long term it may be good,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;In these situations, where the law suspects a werewolf of a crime... based on our own rules... mom and dad will have to do something that will force the police to kill them... and while we don&#39;t age quickly... bullets are still VERY lethal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about this council?&quot; I asked, &quot;What if they help him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Alpha&#39;s Council won&#39;t help him survive,&quot; Tonya answered, &quot;They may send someone to double check and make sure that they&#39;re guilty of the crime they&#39;re accused of... but if there is evidence... they will actually help in the &quot;manhunt&quot; and will make sure that the werewolf or werewolves in question are killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still may need to do the division for the short term,&quot; David warned, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me, based on what Sasha and Mary telling Nate and I, that he&#39;s not only behind the murder but other illegal adventures... but if he can avoid capture by the police, the Alpha&#39;s Council will let him reign as Alpha in Fangton.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d let a murdering pig of a man stay free?!&quot; Fred demanded sounding rather angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d let a Pack Alpha who&#39;s kept werewolves secret stay free, particularly when the alternative is a freshly bit male being trained to be a werewolf,&quot; Tonya answered with great irritation, making it fairly clear that she didn&#39;t approve of or like Fred&#39;s involvement, despite the fact that murder of his wife made him very much involved.<br />
<br />
&quot;We try to keep our existence secret,&quot; David explained, giving Tonya a brief glare and sounding far more tactful, &quot;Devon is a jerk and probably deserves to be shot... but he has protected our secrecy. It&#39;s why the Alpha&#39;s Council will investigate the situation. But that will take time, and setting the division of Fangton will be key for the short term.&quot;<br />
<br />
That resulted in a collective sigh. The full moon cycle for the month had ended and a new day dawned, but things still looked rather difficult.</p>
