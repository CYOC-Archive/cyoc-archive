<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I’m lucky to be a student at the local community college. No longer a student in middle school or high school, I didn’t have to deal with cliques or groups. I did feel like I needed to use my new magical ring to help others as much as I can while remaining anonymous. I got my first chance as soon as I walked through the main gate of the campus. <br />
<br />
“Hey man, will you just chill out?” a young guy with glasses and curly hair shouted at a bigger dude who was taller and who had big muscles. “I just knew the girl from high school and all I did was say hi to her!” <br />
<br />
“Look here, man!” the big guy growled. “She’s my girlfriend and I don’t want no wimpy, nerdy twig like you glancing at my chick, you got that?” <br />
<br />
He shoved the nerd against the brick wall, causing him to drop his books on the floor. He had a math book and a physics book along with a book on how to play chess. He must have been a member of the chest club which I had considered joining. I felt the need to help the nerdy guy out, especially since he was clearly being bullied by a bigger guy over something which was silly and stupid. <br />
<br />
I got a good look at the two men. The nerd was short and slender. The big muscle guy was tall and built like a tank. Obviously, he liked to throw his weight around and intimidate the smaller guys. It was time to even the score a little bit. I made a silent wish, for the big man’s muscles to leave his body and for all his muscles to be transferred to the shorter nerd. I just stood back and waited for the change to happen. <br />
<br />
“Look here, man… If I ever catch you looking at Jessica again, I’ll punch you in the—” the big guy began, waving his big fist at the nerd, when he suddenly stopped. He froze when he felt his huge muscles dwindle away! The big man, who looked like a football player, now just looked like a tall, lanky guy without any muscle at all after the transformation was over! His arms became thin, his large chest suddenly flattened out, his abs disappeared, and his thick legs deflated, quickly becoming long twigs. All that muscle which he had worked so hard for in the gym just vanished within a matter of seconds! <br />
<br />
“What the hell just happened to me?” he yelped. <br />
<br />
The nerd, on the other hand, just stared at the big man in complete shock, not knowing what was happening to the man who was standing in front of him. One minute, the big guys was as large as a football linebacker. The next, he suddenly dwindled down to a bean pole. But, what happened next was even more shocking. <br />
<br />
The nerd was suddenly overcome by an intense, tingling sensation everywhere, from his arms to his toes. Then, it happened quickly, and it took just a matter of seconds to complete. His biceps and triceps just inflated with raw muscle like they were hooked up with an air pump. His pectorals just ballooned from his frame into large orbs of solid muscle as well! His torso suddenly saw a pattern of thick and solid bricks come to the surface, which resembled a washboard. His legs doubled in width and depth, filling out into big columns of muscle which were wider than tree trunks. Finally, his calves exploded with muscle as they were covered with a network of veins as well. The nerd morphed into a young bodybuilder who quickly burst out of his plaid shirt and ripped holes in his jeans!<br />
<br />
“Aaaaackkk!” the nerd groaned as he outgrew his clothes due to the large muscles which burst from his chest, arms, and legs. “Holy shit!”<br />
<br />
The former football player noticed what had happened and he now realized that the nerd was now the stronger of the two. He raised up his thin arms arm he took several steps back. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Look man… I’m sorry… I’m sorry if I offended you…” he stuttered as he bent down and picked up the books which the nerd had dropped on the floor. He quickly handed the books to the nerd. “I’ll leave you alone, man. I don’t want any trouble from you!” <br />
<br />
The taller guy then turned around and he quickly walked away, clearly feeling scared and embarrassed. <br />
<br />
That was beautiful! I just smiled as I looked at the nerd, who now had the thick, muscular arms and the huge pecs and wide legs. The poor kid slowly walked towards me as I walked up to him. <br />
<br />
“Hey, man! Are you a member of the Chess Club?” I asked the big guy. Now that I could see my work from up close, he was truly massive. His arms were even covered in veins! Damn!<br />
<br />
“Uhh, yeah… we got our first meeting this afternoon! Do you wanna join?” he asked me. <br />
<br />
“Absolutely!” I replied. “I’m Brandon, by the way.” <br />
<br />
“Jordan. Nice to meet you!” I shook his hand. Wow, he had a firm grip. Must be from all that muscle! “Wow, you’re a pretty strong guy, huh?” <br />
<br />
“Uhh… yeah, I think you can say that.” He just shrugged shyly. <br />
<br />
Then we walked to our first class where he handed me a flying which described the activities of the chess club. Of course, I started to wonder if there were other people in my class and later in the club who could use my help, now that I had figured out what I could do with my cool, magical ring?</p>
