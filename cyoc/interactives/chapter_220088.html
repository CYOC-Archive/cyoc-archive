<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Tiny, tiny bit of male self pleasure, mainly in description of Noah&#39;s body parts and Shannon touching said parts. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shannon let out a cry in shock as she was lifted higher and higher into the air, the ground beginning to grow further and further away beneath her. She buried her muzzle into Noah&#39;s scaly hide as he shifted his tail and adjusted his wings into a glide, turning with the skill of a dragon that had flown a 1000 times and began to glide across the mountain side, the forest stretched out below them. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t drop you.&quot; Noah whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better not, or I will bite you.&quot; She growled, barely opening one golden eye to see trees rushing past them far below. She shut it again, her heart pounding in her ears. She could hear Noah laugh, his forked tongue coming out and licking her pointed ear. It was soothing and slowly she began to open her eyes again, spotting a flock of birds ahead. Instinctively she snapped at them as they flew past, nearly getting a mouthful of feathers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Was that Shannon or the Wolf?&quot; Noah snorted playfully as the forest below gave way to darkened houses. They were approaching the edge of the city limits, at this time of night barely anyone would be awake, still it was risky to fly over a populated city as a weredragon carrying a werewolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a bit of both.&quot; Shannon leaned up and licked his muzzle as Noah made a sharp turn, angling for the forest again. &quot;Higher&quot; She barked, closing her eyes, feeling the wind against her fur. Noah flapped his wings and the two lifted, heading through the cloud layer. For a moment they were surrounded by pure white and gray, Shannon could not even see her own paw through the mist, and then in the moment of a breath they burst through and they were surrounded by a sky of stars, and a sea of clouds. <br />
<br />
Their eyes met, no words needed to be shared, Shannon&#39;s tail thumped between her legs, and thumped against Noah&#39;s tail. She lifted her head back and howled at the moon and stars above them. Noah let out a cry to join her howl and suddenly they were back through the clouds again, guiding back towards the mountain.  &quot;Are clothes are over there.&quot; She pointed with a claw as soon as she began to catch familiar scents again. <br />
<br />
Noah cocked his head and looked down, angling toward the direction she was pointing. &quot;Are you sure? I can&#39;t smell anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Doggy nose beats dragon nose.&quot; She giggled as he touched the ground, with a timid foot, she pulled away from him and settled both feet back on solid Earth. She blushed and looked into his eyes, digging her foot paw into the ground. &quot;Do you like being a weredragon?&quot; She ran a paw over his chest. &quot;Dragon-man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I like it but if I can&#39;t be a part of your pack... if I can&#39;t be your boyfriend then..&quot; He looked down ashamed, his tail drooping. &quot;It&#39;s only for tonight anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon tipped his muzzle up and kissed him on the muzzle, her tongue coming out and exploring the fangs inside his mouth, running the length of it as she opened her maw as wide as she could, fighting with her tongue against his forked tongue. She could feel his hands rise, and reach her chest, cupping her small furry breasts. She had never had a boy touch her before, but she had dreamed of this moment and her body responded with her nipples hardened, a moan leaving her throat. The magic that held back her heat broke and suddenly a flood of tween hormones rushed through her body like a fever. &quot;Don&#39;t stop.&quot; She broke the kiss, feeling his fork tongue slither down her neck.<br />
<br />
She twisted and turned, suddenly feeling something wet and warm push against her stomach. In a haze she looked down and gasped, she had never seen a boy&#39;s privates before except for health class, but what she saw looked nothing like the presentation. There was not just one but two of them, brightly blue boy scaly parts they were long and stiff with small rigids going down them. The top of each had a pointed head that looked more like an arrow. She had expected one, but not TWO! &quot;That&#39;s your thing?&quot; She took a step back, poking the left one with a claw, a clear fluid left the tip attaching itself to the claw as she pulled her hand away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boys call it a penis.&quot; Noah blushed and trembled a bit, using both hands to grip each one as Shannon timidly leaned in to sniff each one of them before pulling away. He stood still, too embarrassed to say anything or do anything, he wanted to stuff his penis... penises back into his pouch and fly away. &quot;I don&#39;t usually have two, I promise!&quot; His voice cracked in embarrassment. <br />
<br />
Shannon covered her muzzle and giggled, accidentally getting a strong whiff of whatever fluid had caught on her claw earlier. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, in my pack you usually see everyone naked alot, so it&#39;s no big deal.&quot; She closed her eyes and she could feel her fur retreat across her body, within moments the werewolf was gone and the young preteen girl was all that was left standing infront of the big were dragon. &quot;This is me.&quot; She said meekly. <br />
<br />
Noah instantly turned, shutting and covering his eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t want to see.&quot; He shook his head as the dawn rays began to peek over the mountain, his own transformation back to boyhood began. &quot;Not until I am officially part of the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shannon smiled and stepped forward, kissing his cheek as scales gave way to skin. &quot;I look forward to that day.&quot;</p>
