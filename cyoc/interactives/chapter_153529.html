<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four boys were on the etch of their seats. They were excited and they just could not hide it. William stroking his scraggly naturaly ginger neck beard, that stod in great contrast to his black colored hair.  Johnathan felt like he hadd butterflies in stomach. Nicholas was tapping his feet annoyed. And Dillon was leanig comfortably back in William&#39;s expensive gameing chair. <br />
<br />
The four guys hadd all hyped up this littel interweb urban legend for months now. &quot;Can you just click the fucking link, Dillon!?&quot; Growled Nicholas at Dillon. &quot;Don&#39;t get your panties in a twist, dude.&quot;  Responded Dillon with cocky grin. And he finally clicked the link.<br />
<br />
William&#39;s desk top PC started flickering for a second or two, befor a blinding flash engulfed the rom, and the group felt like they got shocked by a joy buzzer, It lasted no more then a picosecond. And then the browser they had Yourtruth.now up inn closed it self out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happend to Yourtruth.now?&quot; Velma pondered. &quot;By the way am I the only one who think that Yourtruth.now dounds like it could be a good name for a lifestyle brand.&quot; The blue haired 19 year old readjusted her problem glasses. Velma was the textbook definition of the self righteous killjoy. Engaging in  activism meant that she began to truly belief that she was better than most. Becoming a conspiracy theorist only furthered that belief for her. Thinking that she had an understanding of the world that the general public didn&#39;t gave her an almost unrivalled ego. It was a problem not even her parents could fix.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I could totally see Yourtruth.now be the name lifestyle brand. But do you have any good theories about what happend, cutie?&quot; Joan asked. Being Velma&#39;s childhood BFF and current GF meant that she too had been sucked into the &quot;dismantling of the patriarchy&quot; as they called it. While not as fanatical, she still had a dedication to the cause that could not be quelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, it&#39;s obviously just the usual suspect, sweetie. Russian incels! Who else would know how to kick us of the sight just as we were going to start the quiz?&quot; Velma responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whateverrr, let&#39;s just click on the link igen or, like, give up or whateverrr,&quot; Nicki whinnied. &quot;My editor&#39;s not gonna give a shit about what I write as long as it&#39;s on time. So just like dont wanna, like, waste my time on this if its nothing or whateverrr.&quot; The chestnut haired woman was the same age as Velma and Joan, but had dropped out of college due to her wanting to focus on her mental wellbeing. Nicki had some serious daddy issues. So she totaly didn&#39;t care what her &quot;white nationalist&quot; parents tougth about her quitting school or that she had gotten a job at a &quot;news&quot; network that pedalled all the moral outrage she was an believer in. While a terrible and untrustworthy organization, it mostly made vapid personalety quiz&#39;s and intrusive gossip articles, but it supported her beliefs and that was good enough for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maby we should not click on it igen? I don&#39;t want them hacking my laptop,&quot; Velma reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think it&#39;s best if you take over then, I don&#39;t wanna mess up your PC.&quot; Daisy nervously explained as she moved out of Velma&#39;s seat and began tweak her hijab a little bit. Being an uyghur woman meant she was effectively both the token asian and token muslim in the group. Daisy originally had a hard time believing in the oppression Velma, Joan and Nicki was convinced that she were experiencing as an first generation immigrant woman of color. It took a few months for them to get her to realize how &quot;bigoted&quot; this country  was and what most people &quot;really&quot; thought about &quot;people like her&quot;. It did not help that when thise topics come up in conversation, as they frequently did, Velma would allways remind her that they knew they also were &quot;not good white people&quot;. Daisy really wish Velma would stop saying that. Or whenever Daisy got a crush on a guy, Joan would allways bring up rape statistics and point out a billion red flags about every guy. Before Daisy was just a little shy around guys she liked, now she is down right terrified of men in general. After all the warnigs Daisy&#39;s woke friends have given her, it starded to take a toll on her confidence in addition too give her sosial anxiety. And whenever she tried to talk her friends about how she felt, Nicki would allways shut down the conversation immediately, becuse it &quot;triggered&quot; her. At last Daisy at least had been inspierd by her friends many rants about the dangers of organized religion, too confront her incredibly strict, conservative parents about their old fashioned and deeply rooted cultural beliefs and come out as an atheist and that she wished to stop wearing a hijab. When she hadd told her friends what she pland to do, they supported her the best way they could. By telling her that she did should not give up her beautiful faith just to please please societies expectations and the she should be proud to wear the hijab, becuse it is a &quot;symbol of women&#39;s empowerment&quot; despite what those &quot;sexsist white males&quot; said. The result was that the once passionate, self assured, albeit little bitt shy asian girl that at one point was at the top of her class in their college, was now reduced to an constantly anxious, self conscious, asian girl that was totalty dependent on their littel friend group, and was now at the bottom of her class. Due too her plummeting grades an untrue rumor had started, about how she only got acsepted to the college becuse of her minority status. Daisy doubted her abilitys more and more, like Velma said it was just an &quot;harmfull&quot; stereotype that asians was good with computers, anyway. And she was totally unmotivated, becuse like Joan allways pointer out &quot;no industry is as misogynistic as gaming industry&quot; so it was not like a woman like her ever hadd a chance. All  she want now is just to quit college and focus on her mental healt, like Nicki did. But her awfully strict parents would never let her do that. And at this point Daisy have no courage left to stand up to them, especially with them allready being so mad at her for her bad grades.<br />
<br />
Anyway it didn&#39;t take long after Daisy had left Velma&#39;s cheap desk chair, before the four gals could hear some steps coming up the stairs and then Velma&#39;s bedroom door quickly open. &quot;What the heck, Mom?!&quot; Velma shouted. &quot;We were discussing something important! Can&#39;t you at the very least knock first!?&quot; She explained as he fumbled with her laptop. Velma was quite embarrassed by her 40 year old mother. Becuse she quit college to become an homemaker and never really hadd a real job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry, hon.&quot; Anna Velma&#39;s mother said in an sarcastic tone. Befor she jokently knocked at the open door beside her. &quot;Are we all good now, honey?&quot;  She asked in the same sarcastic voice. Velma was not amused, but it got Joan to start giggling. &quot;I have to hurry down and get dinner ready befor your father gets home.&quot; Anna continued. Velma got red as an tomato in the face. Why did her mother have to talk about how she need to take care of her man in front of bothe of her woke friends and her girlfrend, wile her mom was dressed in a purple dress with flowers spread across it and a fucking lace apron. &quot;Anyhow, I wanted to ask if your friends wanted to stay for dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can&#39;t I need to finish this article or my editor&#39;s gonna kill me.&quot;  Nicki answered. &quot;Sorry, but my parentes have some guests over for dinner to night so I can&#39;t ether.&quot; Daisy  sheepishly said feeling very rude for turning down the invitation. &quot;I would love stay, I mean you make the most excellent risotto! Joan immediately said. &quot;Well then you are in luck, becuse thats what we are haveing.&quot; Anna said with a littel wink. Joan stared at Annas large, juicy booty, with dreamy eyes and lust in her loins. Before she got snapt out of this most lovely trance by her girlfrend shouting &quot;My gawd, mom! Can&#39;t you at least close the door?!&quot; Joan felt a littel guilty. She hadd romantic feelings for Velma. And she found her attractive. A littel on the chubby side maybe, alltho far from obese or anything. But Joan heart hadd allways belong to Anna. Joan have hadd a crush on Anna for as long as she have known her. Since Joan was a littel girl. Since before she even knew she was gay. It was no getting around it, Anna was one sexy milf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s no point in, like, starting somthing new now, or whateverrr&quot; Nicki stated, echoing the thoughts of the other girls. &quot;So ether we try the link one more time now or we, like, just forget about it.&quot;</p>
