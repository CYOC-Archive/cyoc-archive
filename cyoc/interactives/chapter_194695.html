<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam absent-mindedly lifted a hand to his chest and jumped a little where he was sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole... I think it&#39;s working! My chest is feeling a bit different...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam sheepishly lifted his shirt and turned to Cole. &quot;Do you see anything?&quot; he asked, and Cole leaned forward to take a closer look.<br />
<br />
At first glance, it looked like Sam&#39;s body hair there had fallen, leaving only smooth skin. But then Cole noticed that not only his areolas were a bit larger than before, but a small bud seemed to be pushing from under each of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so... doesn&#39;t look like much though&quot;, Cole hesitated, reaching with his fingers to poke one of the bud. Sam immediately jumped under the colder touch, a hard nipple rising in the center of the areola.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Cole apologized quickly, &quot;just needed to check... Yep, looks like they&#39;re growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, I guess... better make sure and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was blushing furiously, but did not recoil from Cole&#39;s touch as his friend investigated the other nascent bud. There was not much to cup at all for now, just enough flesh to break the smooth profile of Sam&#39;s chest and to tug on.<br />
<br />
As Cole prodded and squished carefully, Sam began breathing more heavily, and a tent slowly rose between his legs. One of Cole&#39;s hand brushed against the hard bulge, and Sam whimpered a &quot;Wait!&quot;, scooting back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not... I can&#39;t yet. I don&#39;t know if I want to be touched if I look like a boy, it just feels wrong&quot;, Sam admitted.<br />
<br />
Cole thought of a minute. &quot;Uh, I guess you could... grab some of my sister&#39;s clothes? I don&#39;t have anything else around, sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I would like that better,&quot; Sam answered coyly.<br />
<br />
Cole stood up, readjusting his own swelling bulge, and ran to Melissa&#39;s bedroom, looking through her drawers. There were a ton of discarded clothes she could not wear since her recent growth spurts, so plenty to pick from. Returning with a big pile in his arms, he threw them on the bed for Sam to pick and choose.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks... Could you, like, turn around while I change? This is a little awkward...&quot; Sam asked in an unusually tiny voice.<br />
<br />
Cole turned his back to him and waited, only hearing the shuffling of fabric as well as Sam&#39;s feet on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you can look now!&quot; Sam let out a little more confidently after a couple minutes.<br />
<br />
Cole turned around and almost dropped his jaws. Sam hadn&#39;t picked anything overly complicated - some kind of flowy hippy skirt that swayed with his hips, and a white cropped top that hugged his nascent breasts closely. The fabric was quite sheer through, so Sam&#39;s darker areolas were slightly showing through.<br />
<br />
Even though it wasn&#39;t much, the whole look changed Sam completely, bringing forward his femininity in a way Cole hadn&#39;t expected, and now he was starting to see his friend under a different light.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do I look?&quot; a blushing Sam asked Cole.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... really suits you. Sorry for not taking you much seriously before, Sam. I think you look great in it&quot;, Cole admitted, putting great efforts into his compliment.<br />
<br />
Sam let out a girlish giggle and smiled, turning around to make the skirt sway. Cole took a step forward to catch <i>her</i> and hug her tight, and Sam let out a sigh of contentment as their breasts pressed together.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s scent imprinted on Cole&#39;s brain, exciting his canine senses. Even the smell was different from before, more ambiguous. Without realizing it, Cole drew his lips into Sam&#39;s neck and started kissing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aah... wait,&quot; Sam whimpered again, squirming out of the embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, y-you didn&#39;t like that?&quot; Cole stuttered a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no! It&#39;s fine! I mean... It&#39;s weird because I&#39;m used to seeing you the way you were before too. And it&#39;s my first time doing this and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.&quot; Sam took a breathe. &quot;I guess, maybe it would help if we were doing this together. You don&#39;t have to pretend you&#39;re like me, but if you at least looked more girly, I would feel more comfortable...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole pondered for a moment. The idea did not seem... wrong, to him. In fact there was something exciting in this. He just hoped Sam was seeing him for who he was and not projecting something else on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I can do it,&quot; he finally answered. &quot;Just don&#39;t call me a &#39;she&#39;, it&#39;s not like that for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded eagerly and turned around as Cole started picking through the remaining clothes until he found a crossed cardigan that attached to the front and made his breasts look even bigger, and ditched his pants and underwear for a pleated skirt that barely hid his stirring member; he sat on the bed to make it more inconspicuous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;m good now. Are you?&quot; he asked Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam sat next to him. &quot;I&#39;m ready&quot;, she finally said.<br />
<br />
Cole leaned forward, and Sam did not recoil when he pressed his lips against her&#39;s, and touched her tongue with his. It would have been weird doing that to his friend before, but right now it felt more natural. Cole could not remember if he had kissed someone like that before. Did he do it to Erika? His memory was fuzzy. Anyway, this felt different.<br />
<br />
The two friends laid down on Cole&#39;s bed, repeating the tongue kissing. Cole moved his right hand over her chest, massaging the hard bud through the top, and Sam arched her back slightly and let out a sigh of contentment. Cole felt one of her hands under the fabric of his cardigan cupping one of his breasts, which instantly made him harder. Maybe, a passing thought through his mind, maybe he was the pervert, because he could not explain why those things were turning him on.<br />
<br />
As Sam drew closer to Cole, their hips pressed together and the tents connected, making their excitement very obvious. Sam let out another uncharacteristic whimper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this okay with you?&quot; Cole whispered. &quot;If our... stuff touch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam squirmed against Cole more intently. &quot;Yes... but please call my thing a clit, I don&#39;t want to use masculine words anymore&quot;. The idea was a little strange to Cole at first, but it actually made sense the more he tought about it.<br />
<br />
Rushingly lifting enough of his skirt and Sam&#39;s, Cole then pressed their hips together again. As their met, Cole noticed that Sam had also put on his sister&#39;s panties and not just the skirt. It was a little weird making out in his sister&#39;s clothes but he was trying not to think about that.<br />
<br />
He pulled down on the panties, letting Sam&#39;s erect &#39;clit&#39; out before resuming the frotting. He then lifted enough of the crop top so that he could reach Sam&#39;s puffy nipples and began to suck on them, as Sam&#39;s erection was grinding against his, smearing pre all over themselves and the folds of the two skirts.<br />
<br />
As Sam was begining to moan softly, Cole shuddered as he felt his cock&#39;s knot starting to swell, and his hand flew over the skirt to push his twitching length away from Sam&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sam asked as she was catching on her breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... nothing really&quot;, Cole lied, pushing down on the fabric and his canine dick. &quot;It&#39;s just very sensitive. I guess I&#39;m not like the other guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Sam said, sitting back on the bed, the skirt falling over the oversized &#39;clit&#39; that poked out of her panties. &quot;Why don&#39;t you let me return the favor from earlier?&quot; she asked in a cute voice while turning red as a beet.<br />
<br />
Cole tried sitting, his erection making a huge tent in his lap with the skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just that... it&#39;s...&quot; Cole hesitated. &quot;My dick looks different and I don&#39;t want you to make fun of me. It&#39;s, like, weirdly shaped and big. Very big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I can keep my eyes closed if you prefer.&quot; Sam suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... guess...&quot; Cole answered, unsure. But he was already leaning back, warming up to the idea.<br />
<br />
Sam sat on the floor in front of Cole&#39;s spread legs at the edge of the bed, and she closed her eyes. Cole slowly lifted his skirt, letting the large reddening rocket raise in the air in front of him, and put one hand on Sam&#39;s cheek. &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded, eyes still closed, and Cole pulled her face close to his throbbing member, directing the tip to her lips but keeping one hand over the knot. As soon as she felt him there, she took him in her mouth and began sucking, sending shivers down Cole&#39;s spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow S-sam... not too fast... Is this really your f-first time?&quot; Cole barely articulated as Sam was sucking and licking on his mutant member without answering him.<br />
<br />
The sight of Sam between his legs was a real turn on. His friend was tugging on her own skirt and pressing against the tent of her &#39;clit&#39;, masturbating a little while sucking on his growing cock. He could feel the tip of his glans had become a little pointier, but Sam kept her eyes shut and said nothing, sucking on the copious amount of pre Cole was leaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can touch yourself if you want...&quot; Cole let out between two breath, and Sam happily obliged, pulling her skirt closer to her waist to grab onto her erection and touch herself.<br />
<br />
Cole was trying as best he could to keep his cool but seeing Sam like that was almost enough to tip him over the edge. His furry balls were churning and drew close to his body, which alerted him to the danger.</p>
