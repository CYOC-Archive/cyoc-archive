<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Six months had passed since Kenith—Riley, in his heart—had set his plan into motion. It had started so subtly, like a whisper in the wind. Jeff, his father but also the brother who had stolen his life, began to change in ways no one could have predicted. And the best part? No one knew why. Except Kenith. He had watched it all unfold with a sense of dark satisfaction, enjoying every step of Jeff’s descent into the man Kenith had carefully designed.<br />
<br />
It had started with the hair. One morning, Jeff noticed that his thick, healthy hair was falling out in clumps. At first, he brushed it off—stress, maybe age. But as the weeks went on, his once-full head of hair thinned dramatically, until bald spots became more and more obvious. He tried covering it up with hats, combovers, and eventually resigned to shaving his head, but it was clear he was losing the battle. Kenith watched as his dad’s confidence began to crack. It was just the beginning.<br />
<br />
Next came the weight. It had been gradual at first, just a few pounds here and there, but as the months dragged on, Jeff ballooned. His once-athletic frame grew softer, rounder. Clothes that had fit perfectly became tight and uncomfortable. His gut expanded, his face bloated, and his movements grew slower, more labored. No diet or exercise could stop it—every attempt to regain control of his body ended in failure. He was helpless against the changes happening to him.<br />
<br />
To everyone else, it seemed like Jeff was going through a midlife crisis. His health was spiraling, and with it, so was his appearance. Crooked teeth soon followed, giving him a slovenly look that only worsened his self-esteem. The once charming, confident man who had stolen Riley’s life was now becoming someone no one could recognize—physically and emotionally.<br />
<br />
It was in the little things that Kenith found the most joy. The way Jeff would look at himself in the mirror with disgust, unable to comprehend why his body had betrayed him. The quiet, frustrated sighs as he tried and failed to keep up with his sons during sports or outings. The way his mom—Kenith’s mom—had started to pull away from Jeff, her once-adoring gaze turning into one of pity and discomfort.<br />
<br />
And then, just as Kenith had planned, his mom’s eyes began to wander. Toward Uncle Riley.<br />
<br />
Riley—the clone of Kenith’s former self—was everything Jeff no longer was. He was still young, handsome, athletic, and full of life. He had remained a regular presence in their lives, visiting often, becoming a friend and confidant to both Kenith and Sam. But now, as Jeff’s physical and emotional decline became more pronounced, Riley stepped in, offering a shoulder to lean on. And it was only a matter of time before that shoulder became something more.<br />
<br />
Kenith had seen it coming from the start. It wasn’t long before his mom began to confide in Riley, sharing her worries about Jeff’s health, her growing distance from him. And Riley, ever the supportive and charming figure, was always there, ready to listen, ready to comfort. Kenith watched, quietly thrilled, as their bond grew stronger, closer, until it was obvious to anyone paying attention that there was something more between them.<br />
<br />
By month four, the shift had been clear. His mom had fallen out of love with Jeff, though she wouldn’t admit it. Jeff, now overweight, balding, and self-conscious, had noticed the change too. He tried to win her back with flowers, grand gestures, but it was too late. His physical transformation had only been the surface—inside, he had become a broken man, haunted by his own decline.<br />
<br />
Month five had been when Kenith’s mom finally made the decision. She couldn’t do it anymore. She couldn’t pretend to love the man Jeff had become. The day she told him she wanted a separation, Jeff had been too exhausted to even fight back. His spirit had been crushed by the slow, unstoppable deterioration of his body, and with it, his family life.<br />
<br />
Kenith remembered that night vividly. He had heard Jeff crying in his room, the sound muffled but unmistakable. It had been a moment of triumph for Kenith—a victory that tasted even sweeter because of how long it had taken to come. Jeff had taken everything from him, and now, Kenith had taken it all back. His family, his happiness, his life.<br />
<br />
By month six, they had moved to Spain.<br />
<br />
Kenith’s mom, now free from Jeff, had naturally gravitated toward Riley. The transition had been seamless—almost too perfect. Riley, the man who had once been a clone of Kenith, had become her source of joy, of love. They moved to Spain together, starting a new chapter in their lives. The warm Mediterranean air, the bustling streets, and the golden beaches made the perfect backdrop for their new life.<br />
<br />
And Kenith? He had embraced it all. He was still Kenith, the beloved son, but with the mind of Riley. He had watched as his plans unfolded, savoring every moment of Jeff’s downfall, every step toward the life he had always wanted. Now, in Spain, he was happier than ever. His mom was in Riley’s arms, exactly where he had wanted her to be. Sam was content, though still occasionally confused by how quickly their lives had shifted. But Kenith was careful—he knew he had to manage Sam’s questions, to steer him away from the truth.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the balcony of their villa overlooking the vibrant Spanish coastline, Kenith thought about the last six months. The pieces had all fallen into place, just as he had planned. Jeff—his once-despised brother, now broken and alone—was out of the picture. His mom had found happiness with Riley, her life now intertwined with a man who was, in many ways, the reflection of the greatness Kenith once held. And as for Kenith himself? He had built the life he wanted, the life he deserved.<br />
<br />
As he leaned back, letting the warm breeze wash over him, Kenith allowed a smile to spread across his face. He had won. He had everything he could have asked for. But there was still one more piece to manage: Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam had been noticing things, asking questions about Jeff’s sudden and inexplicable decline. He was starting to wonder why their dad had changed so much, why their family had split apart so quickly. Kenith knew it was only a matter of time before Sam’s curiosity would become a problem. But that, too, could be dealt with. He had the Chronicle, after all. He had the power to shape reality, to bend the world to his will.<br />
<br />
And Sam? Well, Sam wouldn’t stand in his way. Not for long.<br />
<br />
As Kenith snuggled deeper into his chair, watching the sunset over the Spanish hills, he knew that his plan was far from over. But for now, for this moment, he would enjoy the fruits of his labor.<br />
<br />
After all, revenge was a dish best served slowly—and he was savoring every bite.</p>
