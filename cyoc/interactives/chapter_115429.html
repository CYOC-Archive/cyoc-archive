<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took considerably less work for Martin and Josephine Brown to get processed for conversion than either of them had expected. Normally, there was a lot of paperwork to be filled out for someone to get a dose of the Animalian virus, plus more for a double dose. But when Martin and Josephine were handed the paperwork, they found that most of it had been filled out for them. And the extra paperwork for the double dose was severely reduced. What remained to be filled out was mostly their personal information that wasn&#39;t readily available to other people, their signatures, and the signature of their donor.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the Browns were wondering who their donor would be. They had made it very clear they didn&#39;t want it to be Abigail or Samson. But that still left a lot of possibilities. There were several horses on their farm before the outbreak and even more were uplifted when they were rescued from that horse fighting ring. Not to mention the humans that had converted into horses, but that seemed unlikely.<br />
<br />
They had decided to have their conversion over at Lover&#39;s Woods Campgrounds to lessen the chance of Abigail stumbling across them too early. It seemed likely that Shelly, the owner of the place would be providing their dosage. Martin and Josephine just hoped it wouldn&#39;t take too long. They&#39;ve been waiting in their rented room, giving their &#39;last respects&#39; of being human.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll be grateful when we change,&quot; grunted Martin as he tied his bathrobe closed, &quot;Sex is more exhausting than I remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s longer than I remember,&quot; said Josephine as she got her bathrobe&#39;s edges straightened, &quot;Are we really getting that old?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the trouble with living a life of hard work,&quot; said Martin, &quot;It makes you age faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, they heard a knock on the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; called Josephine. The door opened as a mare wearing a similar bathrobe as the Browns walked in. She was carrying a pitcher of milk that she placed on a table that already had plastic cups on it. She was jet black except for a white star on her forehead and the stockings on her feet so Josephine was able to tell who it was. &quot;Delilah?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has been a while,&quot; said Delilah. She hadn&#39;t been by the farm in months, considering she worked at the hospital now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we didn&#39;t know who&#39;d be donating for our conversion, but it&#39;s still a surprise,&quot; said Martin.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of horses volunteered,&quot; said Delilah, &quot;We narrowed it down to the mares because we figured you&#39;d prefer something smoother than being stuck with needles. And I felt like I owed you the most so I was the most persistent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That many horses wanted to donate?&quot; asked Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much everyone did,&quot; said Delilah.<br />
<br />
&quot;What for?&quot; asked Martin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not just the horses, but we feel like we owe you two a lot,&quot; said Delilah, &quot;Animalia wouldn&#39;t have gotten its start if you hadn&#39;t signed up with that government project in the first place. Not only that, but you welcome all the uplifted animals and gave us land to start building. And if you hadn&#39;t accepted your daughter, humans would be facing stigma for wanting to convert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abigail&#39;s the reason you wanted to donate, isn&#39;t she?&quot; asked Josephine. She had heard how the other mares had resented Abby for getting first claim of Samson instead of them. Apparently, Delilah had been the worst of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Delilah, &quot;I was a real nag to her at first and I just want to make it up to her. I feel like I owe her because if she hadn&#39;t claimed Samson, I wouldn&#39;t have met Red Cloud. I know we officially buried the hatchet already, but I think this will actually help settle my debt.&quot; She indicated the pitcher and said, &quot;There, fresh mare&#39;s milk. There&#39;s enough for two doses each at least. Don&#39;t bother trying to keep quiet afterwards. We hear a lot of noise over here. Have fun.&quot; With that, she left the room and closed the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Martin walked over and locked the door. &quot;Well, Josephine, ready to take the plunge?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As ready as I can possibly be,&quot; said Josephine as she filled two cups with milk. She gave one cup to Martin and took one for herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;To a new life,&quot; said Martin before they both drank. It wasn&#39;t like cow&#39;s milk, but it didn&#39;t taste that bad.<br />
<br />
They soon started to feel the changes start. In no time at all, fur had started to spread across their bodies, coal black for Martin and pale brown for Josephine, though darker brown spots were appearing as well. Their fingernails darkened and became thicker as they became more like hooves. Meanwhile, their toenails were covering their shrinking toes as their feet and legs grew much longer. They had to grip the wall as their legs configured to a new form that balanced on their new hooves. Their loose-fitting bathrobes didn&#39;t get in the way of their spines extending out of their bodies and becoming horse tails the same color as their hair. The only real discomfort they felt was when their faces started pushing out. As their ears migrated upwards and became pointed, their mouths started stretched further from their faces, their noses losing shape before they were also swept down their growing muzzles. There was an ache in their jaws as more molars appeared to assist in their new herbivorous diets. In less time, than they had expected, Martin and Josephine had changed into a black stallion and a brown mare respectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...was more of a rush than I expected,&quot; said Josephine slowly as she adjusted her new hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not finished yet,&quot; said Martin as he poured them two more glasses, &quot;In for a penny, in for a pound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine hesitated for a moment. She had already been through a dramatic change already. But then, she was still as old as she was before and the idea of restored health and youth appealed to her. She took the cup that Martin offered and said, &quot;To good health,&quot; before they both drank.<br />
<br />
This time, they could feel a tingling warmth go through their bodies. Martin grunted as his muscles felt more invigorated. He could feel himself bulking up, the muscles he had from years of toil recharging and growing even larger. Josephine moaned as she felt her own muscles harden quite a bit, firmer than they had been before. Their bathrobes started to part as the bodies they originally cloaked became subtly larger. Martin&#39;s exposed chest was becoming broader and more defined than it had been ever before. The real force that was opening Josephine&#39;s robe was her growing breasts. They were quickly regaining the bounce and firmness that time had taken away before expanding even larger. Josephine moaned loudly as she felt her swelling breasts, her brain overloading with the pleasure she was feeling. By the time, they were both finished, their bathrobes were completely open, exposing their bare fronts to each other.<br />
<br />
Martin could have looked like a carbon copy of Samson, except his mane and tail were a very dark brown instead of black and the color of his eyes were still the same. His body was very thickly muscular with defined pecs and abs, though maybe not as big as Samson as he had been working bodybuilding for the IAC competition. Similarly, Josephine looked a lot like Abby now, though her fur coat was a lighter brown with brown spots. She still had blonde hair and a tail. Her body had athletic definition, but not as detailed as their triathlete-in-training daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t felt this good in years,&quot; said Martin as he looked at his thicker arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never felt this good,&quot; sighed Josephine as she stretched her back, which had a lot less aches in it. This, of course, made her breasts jut out more. Martin&#39;s eyes locked onto his wife&#39;s larger rack and he could immediately feel a stir in his loins. He looked down to see that his balls had swollen a lot and were now hanging underneath a sheath. The sheath opened up and a long thick equine dick slid out. Josephine looked back at her husband and immediately noticed his new rod. &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; she said in amazement, &quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d get THAT big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The expression is &#39;hung like a horse&#39; for a reason,&quot; said Martin smugly as he grasped his new dick. It was a handful even for his larger hands. &quot;You wanna give a test run?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Josephine wickered as she felt her libido rising up. Her sex drive had been charged up by their second dose and she need to sate herself now. &quot;Show me what a stud you are,&quot; she purred as she slipped off the robe and laid down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Martin disrobed as well before climbing onto the bed, which was thankfully reinforced to hold the weigh of anthro horses. It took a little positioning to aim his long rod at Josephine&#39;s hole, but then he lowered himself and slid in smoothly. Josephine moaned louder as Martin filled her more than he had before. Sensing his wife&#39;s approval, Martin began to plunge into her, stimulating her more. This was just the beginning of the farmer&#39;s mating frenzy. Of course, they&#39;ll make certain that Abby won&#39;t have any siblings too soon, but the sex they had as humans will be nothing compared to the love-making they&#39;ll do as horses.</p>
