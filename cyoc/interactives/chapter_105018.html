<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Teddy gave a small smile as the Seattle officers collected Ulysses and began to walk him up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be sure to keep him under guard... and WELL guarded,&quot; Teddy instructed to Detective Smith, &quot;we don&#39;t want a guy wanted on various drug related charges in several states and a murderer of a decorated Marine escaping on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Detective Smith did nod in agreement to that and walked with the officers. With that, Teddy turned, intending to talk with Officer Connor on what may or may not need to be done, since Ulysses had apparently changed back at some point. That might give them some good luck with regard to Moon Lake&#39;s secret, but that&#39;d depend on what the body cameras that the other officers from the ambush had recorded, but found Officer Marion approaching with her dog, Trooper, remaining along side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need us for anything more, sir?&quot; Officer Marion asked.<br />
<br />
Teddy glanced around the large single room basement, which was apparently being used as a large storage area for the apartment building. The boxes all did have names written on them to identify who owned what.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did your dog find any additional scent trails down here?&quot; Teddy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not from our perpetrator,&quot; Officer Marion answered, &quot;so if he had anything on him... he threw it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;m sure you can get back to your regular duties,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;we needed you to help track him down and you did a fine job at that. Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Officer Marion answered and then lead Trooper up the stairs leaving Teddy and Officer Connor alone together.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may have caught him, but this won&#39;t be the end,&quot; Officer Connor warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given the fight here and that booby trap bomb,&quot; Teddy spoke, &quot;and the fact that he not only murdered bur burned and desecrated Major Decker&#39;s body, the prosecution will be likely to seek the death penalty. The real question will be to see which federal court he goes to. Either here in Washington where he was caught or in Virginia where the federal charges against him will be... or have been... filed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And both do allow for capital punishment,&quot; Officer Connor answered, &quot;BUT you know even if he gets a court appointed attorney, that they will try to have the punishment talked down... likely to life in prison. Now... in Moon Lake, that wouldn&#39;t be an issue, obviously. But outside it... what do you suppose is going to happen when he lives past the age of the oldest known Normal and still looks rather young?&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy sighed. He knew that could also expose weres as well and that while pushing for the death penalty was an option, that wouldn&#39;t mean that they would get it. It would still mean that Moon Lake would be facing exposure regardless of whether or not Ulysses tail could be explained away.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment that we&#39;ll have to see on how things go,&quot; Teddy slowly, &quot;we won&#39;t be able to get away from avoiding exposure in this case. If we get lucky, he&#39;ll get the death penalty and is executed, likely before his aging becomes an issue. If not... we may be a point where weres cannot hide any more and need to reveal themselves. Surely, Moon Lake has some plan for when something like this happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s something we&#39;re looking forward to,&quot; Officer Connor sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do what I can to help if it comes to exposure,&quot; Teddy promised, &quot;If it can be handled in the BEST possible light... I&#39;m sure we might be able to work out something beneficial to everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Connor nodded and then looked around the basement, &quot;we&#39;d best get going. There&#39;s body camera footage to check and for the moment, you likely still have getting Ulysses to get medical attention for the gunshot wound and likely the bullet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things,&quot; Teddy nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
While her son and his girlfriend had their fun with Jay and Leon, Jen relaxed quietly inside. It wasn&#39;t that she was a bad swimmer or didn&#39;t like water. Far from it, as she had made certain that the home she bought would have a pool, but for the moment, swimming wasn&#39;t on her agenda. She had gotten up a bit later than Tad did, read his note, and simply went about her morning. Normally, she would have preferred that Tad wait for her so that they could have breakfast together as a family on Sunday, but she did want her son get used to Moon Lake and feel like he was part of it and for the moment bonding with others in his new pack made sense. She also did truly feel proud that he was offering to help Amy&#39;s family.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be proud of him, Jeff,&quot; Jen said softly to no one as she watched Tad and Amy carrying Amy&#39;s brothers on their shoulders as they enjoyed their water gun fight, &quot;You&#39;d be proud of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
After her private musings on her pride for her son, Jen sat back down at the dinning table and resumed looking through the Sunday paper. Getting the subscription arranged had been one of the things she&#39;d handled over the phone during the move back to Moon Lake, and it did give her some ability to keep up with the news and to begin looking through the classified section. She couldn&#39;t live off of Jeff&#39;s pension forever and couldn&#39;t spend all her time at home. She&#39;d find some work and move forward. She&#39;d made it through the Seattle paper&#39;s weather section when she heard her cellphone beginning to ring. She sipped her coffee and slowly moved to pick it up. It required her to get up from her chair, but that was no problem for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Jen said in a low voice, &quot;Who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Mrs. Decker,&quot; a male voice said spoke through the phone. Jen recognized the voice as the FBI agent she had spoken with shortly after Jeff&#39;s murder. &quot;This is Agent Green with the FBI. I believe I have good news for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good news?&quot; Jen said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; was the answer, &quot;we&#39;ve recently arrested our prime suspect in Seattle...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You caught him?&quot; Jen asked, &quot;You got Jeff&#39;s killer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice sounded a bit hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got him,&quot; came the assuring answer, &quot;he&#39;s just gone into surgery to remove a bullet that he took during the arrest. Given some other issues on the case, I can&#39;t tell you where the trial will be, but I will do my best to get you a contact number with the Federal Prosecutors that will take over the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I be expected to give a statement?&quot; Jen asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Teddy answered her, &quot;that&#39;ll depend on what the Prosecutor wants to do. My main purpose was to let you know that we&#39;ve caught our man and you will have justice for your husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... thank you,&quot; Jen replied, feeling fairly relieved to hear that. That put an end to her worries for her son. No one would be coming for him, and Jen smiled at that.</p>
