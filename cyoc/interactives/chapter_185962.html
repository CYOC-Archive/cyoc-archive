<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After hearing about how much Eric enjoyed his day dog-sitting for Mr Reyes -- a definite surprise to Ethan given Eric&#39;s initial resistance to the idea -- the brothers went all of Sunday with their original packages. It was coming up to three weeks since the first swap, and Ethan had spent the majority of that time with the much smaller version. It was good to reconnect with the larger cock, and he made sure to show his old friend the masturbatory appreciation it deserved, even being surprised by how much he came during his first teenage orgasm in quite a few days.<br />
<br />
Still, Ethan knew that despite happily sharing equal access to both cocks, he and Eric had new favourites in each other. He knew while he was too scared to give up his original cock, that he also didn&#39;t want to stop being small either, and he was sure Eric felt the same. They were both addicted to the arrangement, and Ethan had never been more thankful that he and Eric could make their lives work around the magic ring in such a perfectly acceptable way. It was why the brothers exchanged knowing grins on Monday morning when Ethan felt his groin pull inwards again right before they parted ways for school, and he found himself actually anticipating another day of little-dick uncertainty with a definite dose of angsty excitement.<br />
<br />
Most of the day was spent as usual, but he was somehow unsurprised when in one of the later study periods, he was once again trapped by Haylee in one of the seldom-used reading rooms. It seemed like she had a sixth sense for finding him when nobody else was around, and she was her usual coy and suggestive self as she kissed his cheek. Closing the door, and pulling the blinds properly closed, she firmly tugged down his pants and made him sit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, you&#39;re king size again!&quot; She crooned as he came into view, her delight obvious as she lowered his underwear to reveal his less-than-stellar crotch.. &quot;Seems like you&#39;re this way a lot recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah, Eric&#39;s really enjoying h- ... uh ... my cock, so, I- ... I, um, let him have it today.&quot; His nervously babbled reply was a dodge around his own preference, while still managing to be truthful about his brother&#39;s fondness for all the extra inches of cock. The air conditioned interior brushed across Ethan&#39;s hairless groin, and he quickly stiffened into his full tiny length.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not disappointed, you know I like your big guy! Just wanted to do a favour again, because you&#39;re always fun, and I love messing around with somebody who&#39;s gorgeous AND open-minded.&quot; Haylee teased, and she licked her lips. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not going to choke on this enormous beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she slid her mouth fully over his erection, balls included, and Ethan groaned from the warm wet smothering sensation. Her pursed lips alone covered nearly half of his shaft, and the rest of it she sucked gently. Her tongue wiggled in his foreskin, sending pleasurable tremours across the sensitive head, and the knowledge that she needed only the tip of her tongue to stimulate his entire cock was exquisitely embarrassing.<br />
<br />
She was looking up at him, not even needing to move to fellate him, her tongue tickling him on all sides, her hands rubbing his thighs. Ethan&#39;s brain was telling him he was a boy who hadn&#39;t even made it to pubescence, too young to be getting this amazing treatment from a beautiful girl on the cusp of full womanhood, too small to really deserve it. She was less blowing him than just kissing his nub! Their eyes met, and she winked knowingly, as if acknowledging his inner turmoil, and that was all it took.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Haylee!&quot; Ethan moaned and gasped, his little cock jerking, and it sprayed its meagre offering onto her tongue. She swallowed once only, before sliding it out of her mouth, and it twitched a couple of times before shriveling against his groin. She pulled his underwear and pants up, fastening them, before she climbed up to sit on the seat next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love how chill you are about being kinky, it&#39;s honestly a huge turnon. A guy so comfortable in his masculinity that he&#39;s happy coming to school with his little brother&#39;s junk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Little brother&#39;s? For a split second he wasn&#39;t sure what she was talking about, and then he remembered -- she didn&#39;t know this actually WAS his!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; he managed, weakly, &quot;me and Eric have always been close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; she switched topic, a thoughtful look appearing, &quot;you&#39;ve met the new guy on the team, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucas?&quot; Ethan nodded. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve met him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d you think?&quot; She asked. &quot;He was really sweet when he chatted to me before the meet last week. Plus, he&#39;s a hunk! I mean, sorry if it makes you uncomfortable or anything, but it&#39;s impossible to NOT notice. I get extra eye candy now, and he&#39;s fiiine as hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, well,&quot; Ethan hesitated, &quot;you&#39;re right. He- ... he IS actually really good-looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second.&quot; Haylee blinked in surprise. &quot;You&#39;re agreeing? Are you bi, or something? I never knew you were, um, curious ... that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither did I, until very recently,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but I think it might be true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! I think it&#39;s more than that. I think you LIKE him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haylee,&quot; he muttered, his face colouring lightly. &quot;Even if I do, maybe kinda like him a bit -- it&#39;s best I don&#39;t do anything about it. We&#39;re on the team together, and he&#39;s new, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s really interested in me beyond being friends. I&#39;d rather not mess anything up by taking that kind of risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside, there was the voice of Ethan&#39;s conscience whispering doubts that he shouldn&#39;t test his feelings on someone like Lucas, who couldn&#39;t possibly be interested in someone as weak as him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really.&quot; She said, deadpan. &quot;You don&#39;t know that. What if he&#39;s actually 100% gay and has a big fat crush on you, and is waiting for the right signals? You&#39;re not gonna know unless you at least try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Ethan shrugged, a little apathetic, but not too downbeat about it. &quot;Being friends is enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, an idea forming in the corner of her mind, &quot;we&#39;ll see about THAT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He asked, not catching the suggestive tone. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. Nothing.&quot; She lied, swift and easy, and then kissed Ethan&#39;s cheek before standing to vacate the reading room. &quot;Just remembered I have something to take care of before the final bell. Great seeing you, stud. Try to keep that behemoth in your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final wink, Haylee was out the door and away.<br />
<br />
If Ethan wasn&#39;t going to pursue Lucas, perhaps a matchmaker was needed.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
It was Tuesday that Ethan&#39;s school was holding a fair for fundraising, and during the day there was buzz around what was going on. The setup had started during the afternoon, and school even finished a half hour earlier to allow extra time for students who were assisting to get everything done before it opened at 4pm. It was only after Ethan got a glimpse of the schedule and roster of those who were helping, that he realised something was up.<br />
<br />
His name was listed to assist with the fun house; finishing the setup, and then running it later into the evening.<br />
<br />
That was strange, Ethan thought to himself. He didn&#39;t remember volunteering to help.<br />
<br />
Then, he saw the other name on the list -- Lucas Sorensen.<br />
<br />
Haylee, that cunning bitch! She&#39;d set this up! Gritting his teeth, he left school early and went to pick up Eric. His little brother was in a good mood -- a common thing these days, because of the ring -- and Ethan felt guilty explaining to him what had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go back early, and stay late to help. I&#39;m really sorry, Eric.&quot; He felt terrible about it. &quot;I know you wanted us to hang out, but I kinda got roped into this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot; Eric frowned, but then brightened. &quot;Well I can still come in with you anyhow, right? Gotta beat staying at home around Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; Ethan ruffled his hair. &quot;Again, I&#39;m sorry we can&#39;t spend it together. Make sure to hold onto your big boy all evening. You&#39;ve earned it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will.&quot; He smiled.<br />
<br />
They stopped off home briefly to drop off school stuff and get changed, before they were back in to Ethan&#39;s school. Meeting up with Lucas, Ethan introduced him to Eric, and the two seemed to get along well. They had personalities that meshed easily, and the new guy didn&#39;t seem to talk down to Eric because he was younger, while Eric seemed to enjoy Lucas&#39; friendly attitude and easy confidence. They chatted like old friends, before the two teenagers had to start arranging the fun house. Eric hung around for a little bit, and then he decided to go explore the fair grounds while it was still closed to the public, and that was when the guys got down to work.<br />
<br />
The house itself was already up, with the exterior looking the part, but it was mostly up to them to put all the props and the rented mechanical pieces in place. Together they shifted the boxes inside and began to unpack and fit everything in place. There was a short slide, moving floors, wobbling stairs, airjets, a ball pit, a mini centrifuge with padded walls, and even a hall of mirrors, plus a few other random additions.<br />
<br />
They got through it all quicker than expected, and the time seemed to pass fast to Ethan. It was definitely due to the company, and he found himself really enjoying Lucas&#39; presence. He had a quick wit and a generous considerate personality that Ethan just thought was SO easy to talk to. Before long, they were laughing and joking together while they worked, and Ethan grudgingly admitted to himself that Haylee was right -- he DID like Lucas! He was just all-round cool and laid-back, but whether it was reciprocal?<br />
<br />
Ethan wasn&#39;t sure. The joking attitude really did come across as flirtatious to him, but he couldn&#39;t tell whether Lucas was like this with everyone, or if there was something more to it. Either way, it didn&#39;t matter, because he was enjoying himself!<br />
<br />
With everything in place, the fair opening time arrived and the public began to flow in.<br />
<br />
The next couple of hours were uneventful, but busy. Eric popped back briefly to see them, and Ethan gave him some spending money to amuse himself with, though he was all smiles anyhow. Clearly he&#39;d been enjoying himself already -- though he wouldn&#39;t say how or why -- but he took the cash, waved happily to Lucas, and was off again to wherever else.<br />
<br />
After a lull in the numbers a little later in the evening, the two were waiting for a group of junior boys to exit, but Lucas noticed that they were one short departing. Calling across, he asked Ethan to go check out that nothing fishy was happening. Making his way through the house, Ethan kept on the lookout and advanced slowly -- the missing boy was one of a couple of troublemakers from that grade, and Ethan was sincerely hoping nothing was vandalised or broken. <br />
<br />
Then he found the problem.<br />
<br />
Reaching the hall of mirrors, Ethan saw a couple of mirrors had been pulled free of their mounts, and were propped sideways and on the floor. Walking over to investigate, he was surprised by a sound from behind, and then hands were tugging at his waistband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha!&quot; The kid jerked them down, pantsing him, and in a gale of laughter was sprinting off through the house to the exit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little shit!&quot; Ethan swore. He was about to reach down to pull up his pants, when he heard another voice, as his friend rounded the corner from the passage to the entry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he pantsed you? What a dweeb!&quot; Lucas chuckled.<br />
<br />
Ethan froze, going red in complete horror. His reflection was fully visible, and in between his legs was clean skin, a soft thin little dick, and a pair of smooth tight balls -- and right as Lucas finished speaking, he casually looked right at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;He can see me! Oh god, he can SEE me!&quot; Ethan&#39;s mind was racing and it felt like his heart was going to explode with panicked embarrassment -- how could this be happening?! They were getting along so well! -- but ... Lucas&#39; expression didn&#39;t change at all.<br />
<br />
Then he snorted in mild amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. These mirrors are funny, everything looks so out of proportion and distorted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snatching his pants back up, Ethan forced out a tortured laugh, trying to sound like he hadn&#39;t just had a heart attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah,&quot; he stammered, &quot;distorted. Totally distorted. Just, um ... a mirage. Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You get those mirrors back into place. I&#39;ll close us down for ten minutes just to be safe.&quot; Lucas pointed with a thumb back to the entrance. &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting out front when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he was gone.<br />
<br />
Head a mess, heart still pounding like mad, Ethan shakily picked up the mirrors and slotted them back into place, taking a minute to make sure they were locked securely in, and not loose enough to be pulled free again. Stepping back, he tried to calm down his racing nerves, when he realised something else -- the mirror Lucas had seen him in was one of the NORMAL mirrors!<br />
<br />
Ethan flushed deep red -- his real cock had been mistaken for an optical illusion.<br />
<br />
Instantly, he stiffened to super hard, and his mind shifted to wondering about something else.<br />
<br />
What would he look like in the other mirrors?<br />
<br />
Eyes darting to the entrance, then back again, Ethan knew he shouldn&#39;t, but he couldn&#39;t help himself. He would be alone for a couple of minutes, so ... why not see? Sliding his pants down to his thighs, he stepped in front of another mirror. His fingers gripped the head of his sensitive immature cock, and he gently stroked it.<br />
<br />
All he could think of was Jared&#39;s secret pic on his phone, how good it was -- but that this was somehow better.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Babycock Ethan. That&#39;s my name.&quot; He whispered it to himself like a new persona, a private alter ego. &quot;I&#39;ve always been this small and smooth. Always.&quot; Ethan slid the skin up and down, breathing heavily from the intense sensations, and he stared at his reflection as he wallowed in the strange fantasy.<br />
<br />
The mirror he stood in front of was more convex in the middle, and the image of his waist, hips, and thighs, was pushed out and exaggerated. His crotch was enlarged along with it, magnified from its diminutive status to appear on the upper side of normal, and Ethan licked his lips, swallowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what it&#39;s like to be a regular guy, to have an average cock.&quot; He continued staring at the masquerade, the pretense that he was larger with the bulging deception of the convex mirror, and the embarrassing knowledge that he really wasn&#39;t. His penis was actually tiny, his growth incredibly stunted, and he could only dream about being larger. &quot;I wish I was like other boys, but I- ... I&#39;m always gonna be Babycock Ethan.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he shuffled across a step, in front of a concave mirror. This was the opposite, and instead of magnifying, the centre of his body was compressed inward. His already reduced junk was pinched down to practically nothing. Less than the size of a nipple, he couldn&#39;t take his eyes off it, and his fingers sped up, reveling in the unparalleled shame of being so much lesser.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;m even smaller!&quot; He whimpered hoarsely, gasping as he jerked at the horrifying sight, his brain filling in the gaps to make it come alive. &quot;What if I&#39;m -- hnnh! -- stuck like this! What if it&#39;s -- hggh! -- permanent?! What if I&#39;m really- ... unnngggh-&quot; he groaned, &quot;-REALLY! ... uuUUUnnngGGGH!! ... Microcock Ethan!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final moan of completion, Ethan let go his mighty ocean, the pathetic squirt of preteen cum spurting and dribbling over his fingers. All the while, the insane pleasure washed through him, and his gaze stayed fixed on the shrunken-beyond-belief blip of his impossibly tiny masculinity.</p>
