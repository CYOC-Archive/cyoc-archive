<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake finally arrived at work, his mind still racing from the intense encounter with the officer. He rushed into the building, his heart pounding as he hurried to his desk. His boss, Mr. Thompson, was already there, his expression stern as he looked up from his computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, you&#39;re late,&quot; Mr. Thompson said, his voice disapproving. &quot;This is the third time this month. I can&#39;t overlook this anymore.&quot;<br />
Jake&#39;s stomach sank as he met his boss&#39;s angry gaze. He knew he was in deep trouble. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Thompson,&quot; Jake stammered, trying to think of an excuse. &quot;I had some car trouble, and then I got pulled over by a cop. It was a mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Thompson&#39;s expression didn&#39;t soften. &quot;Car trouble and a traffic stop? That&#39;s no excuse, Jake. You should have planned better. I expect more from you. I&#39;ve already started the termination process with HR, it might take a few days to complete but consider this your notice that you&#39;re fired. Pack you desk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nodded, feeling a mix of frustration and desperation. He knew he had to do something to fix this situation. As Mr. Thompson walked away, Jake quickly pulled out his phone, opening the mysterious app he had downloaded earlier. He selected himself as the target and generated a sentence that read &quot;You are being fired.&quot; He quickly changed fired to promoted. Mr. Thompson turned on his heels and reapproached Jake. <br />
<br />
He turned back to Jake, his voice now filled with a mix of pride and satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, I need to see you in my office,&quot; Mr. Thompson said, his tone completely different from before. Jake followed him, his mind racing with confusion and hope.<br />
<br />
Once in the office, Mr. Thompson turned to Jake, a smile on his face. &quot;Jake, I&#39;ve been impressed with your work lately. You&#39;ve shown a lot of dedication and hard work. I&#39;ve decided to promote you to a management position. Congratulations. You can take the office over by Steve&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked to his new office, the door slightly ajar, and pushed it open, stepping inside.<br />
<br />
The office was spacious and well-appointed, with a large desk, a comfortable chair, and a window that offered a view of the cubicles outside. Jake took a moment to absorb the change in his surroundings, a sense of pride and accomplishment washing over him. He sat down at the desk, his eyes scanning the papers and documents that were neatly arranged.<br />
<br />
As he looked out the door, he saw four male coworkers seated in their cubicles, engrossed in their work. They were all familiar faces, men he had worked with for years, but now he saw them through a different lens. He was their superior now, and he felt a mix of responsibility and power.<br />
<br />
The first coworker, Tom, was a lanky man in his early thirties, with a mop of curly brown hair and glasses that always seemed to slip down his nose. He was typing away at his keyboard, his fingers flying over the keys with a sense of urgency.<br />
<br />
Next to Tom was Mike, a muscular man with a shaved head and a red thick beard. He was on the phone, his deep voice carrying through the cubicle walls as he discussed a project with a client.<br />
<br />
Across from Mike was Dave, a tall and slender man with a friendly smile and a laid-back attitude. He was flipping through a stack of papers, his eyes scanning the documents with a sense of focus and determination.<br />
<br />
Finally, there was Chris, a stocky blonde man with a round face and a warm smile. He was hunched over his computer, his eyes glued to the screen as he worked on a complex spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
He pulled out his phone and opened the mysterious app, selecting his team as the target and hitting &quot;return description.&quot;<br />
<br />
The app generated a sentence: &quot;Your team consists of four hardworking men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes scanned the sentence, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. He tapped on the word &quot;men&quot; and changed it to &quot;coeds.&quot; He confirmed the change, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and nervousness as he waited for the transformation to take effect.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the world shifted around him. The four men in the cubicles transformed in the blink of an eye. Jake looked at each of them, taking in their new appearances.<br />
<br />
Tom was now a young woman with long, wavy auburn hair that cascaded down her shoulders. Her face was delicate, with high cheekbones and bright green eyes behind her glasses. She was wearing a fitted blouse that accentuated her large, firm breasts. Her skirt was short and tight, showing off her shapely legs. Underneath, she wore a pair of lace pantyhose that hugged her thighs. <br />
<br />
Where Mike had been sitting was now a woman with a slim and athletic figure. Her short, spiky blonde hair framed her face, and her blue eyes sparkled with intensity. She was on the phone, her deep voice now a sultry contralto as she discussed a project with a client. Her blouse was unbuttoned just enough to reveal a hint of cleavage, and her skirt was tight, showing off her hourglass figure. She wore sheer black pantyhose that accentuated her long legs. <br />
<br />
Next he looked to dave. His tall, slender build was now curvaceous, with long, straight brown hair that fell to her waist. Her eyes were a warm brown, and her lips were full and inviting. She was flipping through a stack of papers, her eyes scanning the documents with a sense of focus and determination. Her blouse was loose, but her large breasts were still visible, pushing against the fabric. Her legs were smooth and shapely. <br />
<br />
Finally, instead of Chris he say a young woman with an hourglass figure and a warm smile. His round face was now more angular and striking, with long, curly red hair that fell in waves down her back. Her eyes were a deep blue, and her lips were full and pouty. She was hunched over her computer, her eyes glued to the screen as she worked on a complex spreadsheet. Her blouse was tight, showing off her large, round breasts that threatened to spill out at any moment. , completely unaware of the changes that had taken place. To them, this was just another day at the office.</p>
