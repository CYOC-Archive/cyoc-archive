<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You traveled with Jared to a large medieval looking city that had large walls and watchtowers along the perimeter. &quot;Here it is, but...as glorious as it looks it’s nothing special.&quot; Jared said and you paused then asked,&quot;What do you mean? With walls like that how terrible can it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People are corrupt, the high priestess is about the only pure high official inside there. C&#39;mon, I have a home, you can use it as your home for as long as you want.&quot; Jared said and your eyes widened at this and you held up your claws and said,&quot;No, you don’t have to do that. I truly don’t want to be a burden to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it’s fine, really it’s more of an honor for me personally so I insist that you stay divine liege.&quot; Jared said and you sighed then said,&quot;Two things, first I think it’s really sweet that you want me to stay with you, but mark my words I will repay my debt to you somehow. Second, please don’t call me divine liege or whatever title you give me, if those people are really corrupt then I&#39;ll just feel more like one of them and I don’t like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...what&#39;s your name then?&quot; Jared asked and you paused and blushed,&quot;Uh....I....don’t have one I guess. I mean you know my story, and...well....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, all of that thinking and you didn’t even come up with a name for yourself?&quot; Jared asked and you looked at him and whimpered,&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve been coming to terms with this. I still AM coming to terms with this, so just....let me think.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused for a couple minutes then you looked to Jared and said,&quot;Luna, call me Luna, and well....do you have any spare clothes? I am kind of.....nude.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jared shook his head and said,&quot;Your kind usually walk around and show off their goods. However you angel types usually call those things sacred so....&quot; You looked at Jared and replied,&quot;Sex is sacred, not that I&#39;m opposed to having it. Just that....if I do I want to have sex I want it to be with my soulmate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared nodded to you and asked,&quot;I wouldn’t worry about marriage too much then. Dragons usually mate with any stray female who’s too much in heat to even think about anything else.&quot; You looked at Jared and sighed,&quot;Maybe, I guess it depends on what happens. Let’s just focus on what’s happening right now though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared shrugged then he walked towards the city and you followed right behind him. Despite how Jared seemed sour about the city there were guards stationed at least where you thought they should be. You still couldn’t see much as the only guards you saw were on the watchtowers and the few that were at the gate. You approached the gate and surprisingly weren’t stopped by the guards. You were shocked for a paused for a few moments as you thought about this before Jared grabbed your claw and guided you through the town.<br />
<br />
As you walked you couldn’t help but notice that you attract quite the attention from a few townsfolk. You looked around and saw a few people staring at you, some at your wings, others were perverted guys staring at your rack, and lastly was a couple of male dragons who looked to just be travelers. <br />
<br />
You blushed and tried to take your mind off of things by talking to Jared while you wandered through the crowd. &quot;Hey uh....how’s life here work? I mean, my world has things just....different things.&quot; You exclaimed then Jared replied,&quot;If it’s different then I can show you later. Just follow me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but.....people are staring at me.&quot; You whispered and Jared looked back and said,&quot;It’s okay, don’t worry about them, they’re just not used to seeing a female dragon around here. We’re almost to the area I live in, it’s calm and quiet, I promise.&quot; You nodded to Jared and said,&quot;I...I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Jared soon made it out of the extremely populous area and into a residential area. Jared guided you up to a moderate sized cottage and opened the door for you to enter. You did just that and he followed up just behind you and shut the door behind you both. &quot;Whew, thank you so much. I don’t think I should go out there anymore just as naked as I am.&quot; You exclaimed <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I agree, people are definitely going to be asking about that. Anyways this is the main area, and I paid extra for two private bedrooms. There’s a wine cellar if you need a drink, and your room is on the right.&quot; Jared said and you looked up and saw two doors side by side each other. You nodded to him and bowed,&quot;Thank you, I&#39;ll...find a way to repay your kindness. So....what do we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll send a message to the high priestess, don’t worry, she’s usually very helpful to the common religious people here.&quot; Jared explained and you raised a brow,&quot;And you think she&#39;ll come because you tell her about me, and that’s going to be enough to persuade her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, let’s just say she owes me for a favor that I did for her. Not really a personal favor if you were wondering, but it was more one for her church so....&quot; Jared said and you nodded to him and said,&quot;Okay...well, I need to rest after that so I’ll be in the room that you gave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There’s a bible in there if you want to read through it, and feel free to use it for what it is and sleep.&quot; Jared said and you nodded to him and said,&quot;I can’t thank you enough for your generosity Jared, I will make sure that I repay you for your troubles.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then walked over to the room and entered it, then looked around. The room was completely dark and the only things that could create light were candles. You take a deep breath and sigh, and then see a puff of smoke escape your mouth. You breathe again and smell it to make sure and it was definitely smoke, and you decided to test something. You spotted an oil lamp on the an end table next to a bed made out of animal hides and you carefully blow into it. <br />
<br />
You watched as a white stream of fire comes from your mouth and ignites the oil lamp, and it illuminates the room. However much to your dismay the room wasn’t as roomy as you first imagined it would be. It was narrow and just wide enough to hold a bed with an end table to its side. You already stood at the foot of the bed and you had only just entered the room, and you sighed,&quot;I guess I should’ve expected less as opposed to more.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then lay down on the bed and look at the end table, and notice a drawer on it. You open it up and find a bible inside of it and you take it out to examine it. You stared at the cover and wondered if you should even open it, you don’t even remember caring about reading one of these in your entire life, but now you almost feel passionate about opening it up and reading it. So you did just that, and began reading it and gradually you grew more tired with time. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly you managed to finish about one-fourth of the book before you grew too tired to continue. So you put it back into the drawer and blow out the lamp and decide to get some sleep. You pulled the hide blanket over your body and almost immediately fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next day you woke up and...</p>
