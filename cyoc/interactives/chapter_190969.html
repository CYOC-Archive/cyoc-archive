<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan ate all the food his mom had spilled on the floor, sniffing afterward to make sure he hadn&#39;t left anything behind, before sitting in the floor and looking around as if he&#39;d just woke up in an unfamiliar place. He saw Daniel and Jane (his mother) standing there talking as they watched him.  As a lion Susan had a vague idea of &#8203;&#8203;who the people in front of him were and he knew they were important to him, although he couldn&#39;t remember why nor what he was before his transformation, as he didn&#39;t even remember having changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Are you telling me that lady was a witch and the cookies she gave are cursed? So that&#39;s why I changed before?&quot; Jane said<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. I was trying to figure out what I was going to do after you became a stag, but thankfully it was temporary and you got back to normal.&quot; Daniel said<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only had one cookie and Susan had two. Does this have a different effect? Will it just take longer to get back to normal? Or will the effect be permanent?&quot; Jane said<br />
<br />
&quot;Grrroooooowwww&quot; Susan interrupted the conversation with a roar, lunged at them and leapt at the two of them as if they were prey to his chase.<br />
<br />
Mother and son tried to escape the lion by advancing on them, but only Jane managed to escape while Daniel was pinned to the ground.<br />
<br />
Daniel was afraid of his sister and tried to escape, but Susan was not only much stronger now, he was also heavier and that was gave advantage over him.<br />
<br />
Despite knowing instinctively that they were important people to him, the only thing it did was that Susan didn&#39;t try to hurt them, but it didn&#39;t stop him from using his strength for other things. So he sat on his brother and rubbed his hard cock against him.<br />
<br />
Jane was frightened by the situation, but still she mustered up all her courage and tried to pull her daughter off her son, but she couldn&#39;t do anything against the strength of a lion. &quot;Susan, stop it. Please get off your brother.&quot; she said in her attempts but got a shove that made her fall with a thud to the floor.<br />
<br />
When Jane got up, Daniel saw that, just like before, her muscles started to grow, as well as a bulge in her pants. <br />
<br />
At first Jane kept trying to get Susan off of Daniel, until she realized she was transforming herself. When she realized she was already exhibiting a massive erection straining her pants, and she couldn&#39;t resist thrusting her hips forward and coming, having another one of her pants through her cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan, please stop. I have to help mom.&quot; Daniel said but all he got was a white spurt of cum his sister shot in his face when he came.<br />
<br />
When Susan&#39;s orgasm was over the lion loosened its grip on his brother, which allowed him to get out of there and run to help his mother get rid of her clothes. Daniel helped his mom get her pants off in time before a new ballsack replaced her vagina. Her male genitalia this time was different from when she turned into a stag earlier, and her ass was growing while her anus was getting more bulging. He helped Jane later take off her blouse along with her bra, which was loose thanks to her shrinking breasts.<br />
<br />
Jane found it difficult to concentrate, as her transformation made her extremely horny, so much so that while her son took her shirt off she came again. She felt like she was in heaven as the cum escaped from the heart-shaped tip of her cock, but in that moment she remembered the situation and realized she was turning into an animal again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that cannot be. I don&#39;t want to become an animal again.&quot; Jane said and soon after some cracks were heard as her leg joints were reconfigured and her feet turned to hooves. &quot;Now that I know what&#39;s happening to me I won&#39;t give in, I won&#39;t let that witch&#39;s curse take my humanity from me.&quot; she said and started forcing her entire body in order to try to go against the transformation and, to Daniel&#39;s surprise, it worked and stopped most of the rest of her transformation, except for the tail that grew on her and the fur that covered her body, but this was also a very painful process for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay mom?&quot; Daniel asked Jane not being able to see the pained expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I did it, I defeated the power of the curse, at least partially. Thanks to that I can still think clearly, despite being very horny.&quot; Jane said when the pains passed, thus analyzing the final result of her transformation. Her underside had become the back of a horse, the farther up she was, the more human she looked. Her body was completely covered in short white fur streaked with black, which was a sure sign that she had managed to avoid turning fully into a zebra. In addition to the mixing of species she became mixed between the sexes as well, as underneath she had become fully male, while above she was female. She still had her breasts, but they were much smaller than normal.</p>
