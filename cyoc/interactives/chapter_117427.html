<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Helen looked at her model, looking at what she could change. She felt a little fearful of making big changes. What if she made the mistake she did the first time? One tool in the program gave her the option to select a piece of her body, so she could change only that. So if she were to click on her finger using that tool, it would give it a blue tint, showing her that it was selected on the Chronivac. She selected her ring finger, taking a look at what potential changes were already shown.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac gave her the opportunity to change her finger into a claw, for example. Scrolling down the list of items she saw even more ridiculous options like pencils, or scissors. She didn&#39;t feel inspired that much, so she deselected it. Now that she&#39;d seen that there were options and she could change the finger back into one of hers again, she knew it was safe to say she got it under control.<br />
<br />
She selected her groin to see what options she had over there, and grinned at the sight. If she wanted to, Helen could change her pussy into that of a horse&#39;s, but she got annoyed at the fact that the Chronivac had to show her a horse&#39;s pussy in detail, muttering a small complaint again about censuring certain things. <br />
<br />
With her legs in the way on her 3D-model it was difficult to see how the changes looked like and it annoyed her a bit. She tried getting the legs out of the way, but it was a tall order to do so. She right clicked, giving her a small set of options on the selected object. In the set of options she saw &quot;split&quot;. It would detach her cunt from her body, meaning she had the possibility to get a better view on it.<br />
<br />
Taking her pussy apart, Helen zoomed in. Finally having those legs out of the way, they didn&#39;t block her view anymore. She looked at the list of options of what to change her pussy, seeing the strangest things pass by. She scrolled and scrolled, but looked in disgust what some options were. Helen changed her mind. &quot;Let&#39;s not change that stuff into something else again.&quot; She still had to save, which was odd. This time she didn&#39;t change anything right? To be sure she created a backup for herself, having it take surprisingly short to save, and closed the program behind her.<br />
<br />
It was already 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, Helen noticed. She wanted to quickly drink some coffee again, before preparing dinner, but first needed to go to the toilet.<br />
<br />
Entering her bathroom Helen put on the lights. She stood in front of the bowl, took off her belt and unzipped her pants. Trying to grab for her penis, she failed, but then realized she didn&#39;t have one anymore. Oh well, she knew how to sit down, so why not do that? Closing her zipper, she this time put down her pants and sat down on the cold bowl. It gave her a shudder, she was supposed to be used to it though. Ignoring the feeling of a cold toilet bowl on her new, round ass, Helen did her business.<br />
<br />
She was surprised not to hear any pee dropping into the toilet bowl, usually she aimed right into the pit, making a loud sound, but this was just uncomfortably silent. Helen stood up quickly as all of a sudden, a warm stream ran down her ankles. &quot;What the fuck happened?&quot; Helen asked herself in surprise, quickly stepping out of her now wet pants. Her feet were wet thanks to her accident, she saw in disgust. Still, she was a hundred percent sure she peed right into the toilet bowl, so how did it end up there?<br />
<br />
After stepping on a towel and cleaning her feet dry a bit, Helen noticed a piece of skin inside her now wet boxers. Picking it up with both hands, not noticing the other side of it, she felt as if she was being touched herself. Helen ignored it though. She saw the skin had the same texture as hers, or at least the one of the 3D-model. Comparing it, by putting it on her arm, its tan showed no difference to that of his arm&#39;s. She turned it around quickly and was speechless by what she saw. Holding it in disgust with two fingers, she saw her own cunt in front of her. She absent-mindedly also dried off her arm, as she got a few drips of her pee on it when comparing it with the thing previously thought to only be a piece of skin.<br />
<br />
Helen looked down at her self, but wasn&#39;t really able to see anything. Feeling down there, all she felt was plain skin. It felt just like regular skin on her legs, even when she rubbed it. It brought her to the conclusion her pussy got detached from her body. Holding her cunt in the palm of her hand, she grabbed some toilet paper in the other and dabbed it dry. Laying it down on the counter, skin on the surface, giving her a shiver anyway, she picked up her wet pants and boxer, throwing them in the laundry basket. She&#39;d wash them later she thought.<br />
<br />
Helen carefully took her pussy in between her index finger and her thumb and walked back to her computer again, annoyed a bit, because she already sat behind it for hours within a day. But still, something had gone wrong right? After the computer was finished starting up Helen opened the Chronivac program again. It immediately showed the 3D-model she&#39;d become, just the night before. Looking at her model, she saw absolutely nothing wrong. If something were to show what she changed without noticing, it would be the log files, so she loaded them.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s where Helen saw her mistake. In the log files it read the following: <br />
&quot;5:07, today - Command &#39;split&#39; used on #entity ID:groin&quot;.<br />
<br />
Helen gave herself a face-palm at her mistake, but was relieved it wasn&#39;t a change that needed a lot of time to reverse. What was nice about the change, was that her pussy got detached and that she could just hold it, giving her a closer look to it. Helen realized that she absent-mindedly kept changing the way she held, it as it felt annoying to have herself feel like she&#39;s touched the whole time. That&#39;s where it hit her. She could still feel herself! She experimented with feeling her clit, and felt bliss immediately. She felt her pussy, and held in front of her, she could reach it far better now, and she would as well...</p>
