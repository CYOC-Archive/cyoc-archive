<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim bought a trench coat. She told the clerk, because she was still a bit self conscious about the disparity between her female head on top of her hulking man body underneath the loose clothing she had thrown on, that she was shopping for her father and that he was about her height. <br />
<br />
With her dark blonde hair, she could get away with lying and saying she had Norwegian Viking genes. Greg was still dark haired, so his wig was dark brown to match. <br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly are a tall one. You must get that a lot,&quot; the effeminate male retail clerk remarked to her. &quot;How tall are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Six foot three,&quot; both Kim and Greg responded at the same time. They both knew Greg&#39;s former height, but Greg had momentarily forgotten that he had Kim&#39;s former height of 5&#39;5&quot; and that she now towered over him. Disguised as a woman, he blushed. &quot;I mean, she is, not me,&quot; he said in an attempt at falsetto while he looked meekly at the ground, trying to look non-descript. He felt totally embarrassed. The effeminate gay guy was bigger than he was now! This guy was only 5&#39;7 and even though he was what Greg would have called a weak little fairy before, was now more than a bit stronger than Greg. The man was in his 30s with a receding hairline but his smallish arms contained bulges that said he worked out his ectomorph frame to the full extent he could manage and that made Greg...slightly horny. <br />
<br />
He turned away and pretended to look at items on a rack while his now gargantuan wife tried on a trenchcoat she wound up liking immediately and the clerk rang her up, commenting once again that she should be in the Olympics, that she could easily beat other women at basketball. Kim laughed and thanked him and blushed. <br />
<br />
There was a costume store in the mall they wandered through and Kim told Greg to wait outside, saying she had an idea. When she returned, she told Greg impatiently to follow her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t ask me what I got. I want it to be a surprise,&quot; she told him confidently. <br />
<br />
The parking lot was wide and they had taken a taxi. They had decided to take the bus back to the hotel, since there was a special shuttle. Greg suddenly felt exposed. There weren&#39;t that many people around in the parking lot but the few cars they passed, he suddenly wondered if something...bad happened, if some jerk decided to get out and mug them or rob them...he would be defenseless. He couldn&#39;t in any way fight off a real man with a man&#39;s height and muscular strength. And what if...what if someone, some big huge hulk of a brute, some ogre, some big ape of a man decided to force himself on Greg?? He would need Kim to protect him! <br />
<br />
Scenarios of the reality that he now found himself in assaulted his mind. Kim was walking really fast! He frowned. He kept on having to trot, because she was walking ahead of him without even noticing he was lagging behind her. <br />
<br />
Greg ran up beside her, trying to catch up with Kim. She was focused on getting across the parking lot. She was totally ignoring him. He was so little, after all. A little slip of a thing now. She didn&#39;t realize that with her enormous new man body, her strides were further apart and naturally faster. Greg tried to keep up with her but she kept outpacing him. He wanted to say something but then felt the need to meekly just follow her and not say anything. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s so stupid but I should be the one with the long strides, he thought desperately. Her body is so much better in every way than mine now. Physically stronger, taller, and...<br />
<br />
the word &quot;superior&quot; leapt through his mind. He clutched his new purse and once again, for perhaps the 8th time in a row, tried to keep up with Kim. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, honey! Please! I&#39;m getting out of breath, you&#39;re going so fast!&quot; Greg felt his heart beating and the stress of no longer having his big, large body came crashing all at once into him. Suddenly, he felt depressed. <br />
<br />
He started to cry as he wrung his incredibly feminine arms in the air, his female nails delicately touching the air. He felt ashamed, self-conscious, and felt Kim&#39;s eyes burning down into his. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? What&#39;s wrong with you? Why are you crying? Sweetheart, what is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t know?&quot; he shrugged and wiped his eye as delicately as he could manage and fiddled with his purse strap. &quot;You were going really fast and it&#39;s hard to keep up with you. I used to be that big and with that body and now I&#39;m...tiny. And you&#39;re just...&quot; he began tearing up again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just...dry your tears. Crying won&#39;t help you any, Greg,&quot; Kim admonished him, Greg felt even worse. He started crying harder. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; he screamed dramatically. &quot;It&#39;s just very hard, this is a very sudden change for me! I&#39;ve had to adapt to having boobs and peeing sitting down out of my...vagina,&quot; he whispered, even though no one was around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright. Dry the tears, honey,&quot; Kim said, somewhat swaggeringly. There was a different tone to her voice, Greg noticed. &quot;Look, honey. Sweetie,&quot; Kim grabbed Greg by his womanly shoulders and gave him a tight squeeze. &quot;I know what will make you feel better. You come back to the hotel room with me and you take a nice bath. That body of yours has TOO MUCH tension.&quot; She used her manly hands to squeeze his feminine petit shoulders as she manhandled him from behind. <br />
<br />
She came out in front of him and smiled. &quot;I think I know how to make you happy, sweetie. You just don&#39;t worry about a thing. It&#39;ll all be alright.&quot; <br />
<br />
Greg sniffed and he dried his eyes as Kim held him, towering over him, his head nestled on her manly and muscular chest. <br />
<br />
Greg just remembered leaning into Kim&#39;s body closely on the shuttle. People must think we&#39;re two lesbians with a major height difference, he thought worriedly. <br />
<br />
He barely remembered walking into their hotel room, but he remembered that Kim dropped her shopping bags, and swept him up off his feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kim? Sweetie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right here, baby.&quot; He was suddenly aware of Kim flipping off her shoes while holding her shrunken new husband in her arms. <br />
<br />
No one had carried him around like this since he was a little boy! <br />
<br />
Kim was so powerful she could easily pick him up off the ground and carry him in her arms. <br />
<br />
She gently laid him down on the bed and got her shirt off as soon as she could. She ripped her pants off and stood there, her dick bulging against her boxer briefs, her girthy dick forming an obscene bulge that would certainly identify her to anyone that saw her as a facially convincing trans woman with a larger than average dick of 8 inches. <br />
<br />
She positioned herself on top of her husband and he looked up at the pectorals that were once his, the bulging arms and big hairy hands, the mat of black fur that sprung out from the middle of Kim&#39;s wide and meaty chest, Kim held his arms down gently as she let loose the monster beneath her boxer briefs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, baby. That big dick of mine will make you happy, sweetheart. I know it will!&quot; She seethed with an energy that he had never seen before. Kim had a feral look on her face. She shoved her head down to kiss his.  She laid over him, oogling his boobs and ripped off his dress as if she was angry that there was any fabric between her and his perfect breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, feel that, baby? You feel those sensitive nipples, sweetheart?&quot; Kim felt him up, hungry to paw him like a piece of meat for her to be satiated, She squeezed his tits harder and harder. She manspread her legs out after shucking off the briefs and patted her new muscular leg, tapping it as if to indicate what she wanted, but when Greg didn&#39;t respond, she did it again and commanded him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit on my lap!&quot; she ordered. <br />
<br />
Greg gingerly slid off the bed and walked as if he was a shy schoolgirl going on her first date. <br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, you need to loosen up!&quot; Kim bobbed her new leg up and down, her big dick flopping at well, She situated her husband so he was straddling her giant torpedo of a cock that she had inherited from him only the day before. It felt so right. All of this felt so right in order for them to BOTH be happy. She picked him up and started to stroke her dick with his tiny little ass. <br />
<br />
Greg gasped. She was honestly picking him up and using him as some kind of sex toy to rub one out! He had never thought of being so audacious when he was in his old body!<br />
<br />
What both of them inherently thought was that the hormones were taking over and they were both so in heat that they couldn&#39;t control themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take me! Take me with your big cock, Kim! Take me with that big manly body!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; Kim grunted as she bobbed her bulging new member under him, straddling him in her arms before putting him down, turning him around, and faced him, looked down on him with a satisfied grin. Greg cowered underneath her enormous body overshadowing him. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel to be way down there? You ready to be the girl completely?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kim didn&#39;t wait for an answer. She picked Greg up again and hoisted him up in mid air, and with his dainty legs draped around her man hips, she maneuvered him over to the couch and positioned her cock inside his throbbing pussy. His pussy was already wet when she entered him and soon he felt pleasure flood him as he his wife unceremoniously began fucking him, like some kind of muscular Amazon with the head of a woman and the body of a man combined in a way no surgery could possibly recreate. <br />
<br />
He was in the presence of a new and powerful Kim who was taking matters into her, soon to be his, own hands. <br />
<br />
Her dick was selfishly fucking him. She didn&#39;t care about his comfort at all. She was enraged and engorged and HAD TO FUCK HIM NOW! FUCK HIM! FUCK THAT PUSSY! She fucked him while grunting and looking right at him, frothing at the mouth, challenging him with her glare. No love here, just primal lust that MUST be satiated now that SHE had the BIG DICK in the family. <br />
<br />
She began to overflow with testosterone rush and she rammed her cock into Greg as she again and again, lifted him up in mid air for a while and for Greg it was like a carnival ride where he was on top of a whirling car that went up and down up and down, the room swimming as his vision blurred from the tears or pure orgasm flooding through his new pussy. Kim brought him over to the couch, laid him down and then grabbed both his legs, and holding them up, helped herself to fuck him for one, two, three, four, five minutes. She glared down at him victoriously. She was fucking her husband! <br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YOU, MOTHERFUCKER! I HAVE THE BIG COCK NOW, YOU LITTLE BITCH! YOU&#39;RE MY BITCH NOW, AREN&#39;T YOU! HUH, SLUT?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;YES, I&#39;M YOUR WHORE! FUCK ME, SIR! FUCK ME!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kim took pleasure several times in taking her hands off so she could feel the pleasure of fucking Greg while she did a little muscle victory dance, showing off her muscles as she egotistically posed and took pleasure in how fucking good her body looked now, at how amazingly tall and muscled and strong she had become. She was really beginning to like all this! <br />
<br />
Suddenly, she knew that she had to cum inside him. She wasn&#39;t wearing a condom and she didn&#39;t want to. If Greg got pregnant, SO BE IT! I CAN BE THE FATHER AND HE CAN BE THE MOTHER! WHY NOT FUCKING SWITCH! I&#39;M SO FUCKING BIG NOW! I CAN LIFT THIS BITCH UP IN THE AIR AND FUCK HIM ALL BY MYSELF! I AM A FUCKING MUSCLE STUD NOW!!!<br />
<br />
The denouement came. Kim rammed her rod into her husband and then she fell forward, pinning him down. She lunged over him, her muscular frame trapping him so that he could smell the immense wash of jock pheromones wash over his senses, making all his lady parts tingle with satisfaction over an alpha male body overpowering him. Kim used her muscular arms to support her while she came. <br />
<br />
Kim had never &quot;cum buckets&quot; before. The amount of joy that washed over her as she finally started pumping her seed into her husband&#39;s meek frame made her scream out loud. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I never want to switch back! they both thought as the both reached the best orgasm they had ever felt in their lives. <br />
<br />
Kim slowed down but was still going strong. She lasted, altogether, for fifteen minutes straight as she had multiple male orgasms in a row. It was the best she had ever felt and she couldn&#39;t let go of the desire to do it over and over again for the rest of her life. <br />
<br />
Finally, she slid her cock out, posed naked and dripping man juice as he cock swayed over her husband&#39;s freshly fucked girl frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you like THAT, huh? This fucking muscle body is looking real fucking good on me, doncha think?&quot; She flexed her biceps when she emphasized words. &quot;I think you and me are just getting started on exercising these BIG muscles of mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They look so much bigger on you! I had no idea I had such a great body. I was always afraid I was too lanky!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You were. I&#39;ve seen photos. You don&#39;t do this body enough justice. You&#39;re always doing that.&quot; Kim did a most muscular pose. &quot;Look at that definition! Your body is more incredible than you give it credit for!&quot; Kim did more poses, feeling more and more comfortable with herself and how she carried herself. She felt like she could do anything! <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here. Don&#39;t move,&quot; she instructed Greg. <br />
<br />
She went into the bathroom. He heard her pissing standing up and it made his pussy wet to think of the humiliation that he now had to take a piss out of a clit, and that his wife now got to stand up tall and hard and shoot a mighty jet of piss out. He heard her laugh a deep laugh. She kept laughing as she flexed until it dropped several octaves. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
Greg gasped. His voice was lighter. He heard the noise of his clippers being turned on. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re cutting your hair?&quot; he said, his voice was now much higher, about halfway between a man&#39;s and woman&#39;s voice. He sounded like a trans man might after her voice has dropped a little bit. &quot;Oh my gosh, my voice!&quot; The sound of the clippers mixed with Kim&#39;s indistinct voice. Her voice was muffled but it definitely sounded deeper! &quot;I don&#39;t like this, we have to switch back soon! What will I do? What will I do?&quot; Greg fretted. His voice now sounded more and more like a trans woman who has been taking estrogen for weeks, months and then years. His voice softened and heightened. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this! I have Kim&#39;s voice now!&quot; He looked ata his shrunken frame in the bedroom mirror. He looked at his decidedly male face on a woman&#39;s small body. His head had shrunk to fit the size of his body, he noticed. He had also noticed Kim&#39;s head looked much bigger on his body than it had before when she was fucking him senseless. <br />
<br />
He heard the clippers stop and Kim lumbered into the shower on her big legs. The sound of running water and Kim moaning. Was she...jacking off in the shower??<br />
<br />
She was. She was so horny that she had to cum again and she couldn&#39;t wait for Greg. He gulped. How to deal with this kind of sexual appetite anyway? He had NEVER had this kind of stamina that Kim was displaying with his body. He had always been very gentle with her and she had, having no previous experience with women, not realized that most men are taught to go easy with a woman while lovemaking. But Kim had never had that talk from any of the men in her life. She had simply been overwhelmed with lust and had gotten plenty rough with Greg, using him as a puppet for her own enormous tool&#39;s sensory overload. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH YEAH!&quot; he heard his former voice exclaim. Powerful. She sounded powerful now. He gulped and began to get his clothes back on. <br />
<br />
&quot;GREG!&quot; his former voice belted out from the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; he cried out, in Kim&#39;s flowing, musical voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we&#39;ve swapped voices now, little man!&quot; Kim&#39;s voice grew in volume as she came out of the bathroom to the point where it made Greg jump. Her voice was so loud and authoritative now! Kim felt her naked body enjoy the cool air, her dick hanging and cooling after her shower. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I gotta say, I am starting to look pretty good as a man!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kim had shaved all her hair, cropped it all off. She had the same soft features of a woman, lacking any stubble at all, smooth as a boy. She looked more like a young boy than a woman now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to that voice! I thought we might go out tonight but you wear your wig as the woman and I take my turn to present as a man. Doesn&#39;t that sound like a good idea. Oh and...I also bought a little something special.&quot; Kim, talking in her new man voice, delighted in the deepness of it. She sauntered over to one of the shopping bags and picked out the beard and facial hair disguise kit she bought from the costume store. <br />
<br />
After applying the glue and deciding on sideburns and a mustache, Kim glanced at herself. She was wearing Greg&#39;s clothes along with her trenchcoat. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think? Do you think I&#39;ll fool people into thinking I&#39;m all man?&quot; Kim asked, hopefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look like a man. I wouldn&#39;t guess that you were even trans after you glued those things on. They look real. I till look like the world&#39;s homeliest girl, though,&quot; he said glumly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful and tomorrow you&#39;re going to look even more beautiful. Now get dressed. I&#39;m taking you out on a night on the town as YOUR HUSBAND and you will be MY WIFE.&quot; Kim smirked. <br />
<br />
That night was a blur. Kim took the lead, deciding to take Greg out to dinner, choosing the restaurant and ordering the Ubers. She monopolized almost every conversation, making everything about herself and her job, and lamenting that she never liked it and desperately wanted to quit. She began asking Greg about details of his job and he answered all of them dutifully. He didn&#39;t even question why Kim would want to know such things. Listening to her manly, deep voice just made his pussy throb. He wanted her big dick inside him again. It felt so unbelievably good before! <br />
<br />
She insisted they go to a club where Greg felt self conscious. He was short enough to be a woman but his face gave him away so he hid behind his wig as much as possible, draping the hair in front of his face and wore sunglasses on top of that. <br />
<br />
Kim felt energy pouring into her as she basked in the fact that she was taller than most of the people in the room, certainly taller than ANY of the women by far. <br />
<br />
She grabbed a few drinks and ordered a Shirley Temple for her meager little husband&#39;s girly body, to get him liquored up. She had a Manhattan and a few beers. Her body had a much stronger tolerance for alcohol now and she smirked again as she held Greg against her tall body, massaging his shoulders and tiny deflated arms. Was it pride that she felt for bagging such a prize? <br />
<br />
She imagined how it would feel to always be this tall, this imposing, this full of confidence, size, strength...<br />
<br />
Greg didn&#39;t remember much about getting home. Kim took care of everything. She carried him from the taxi to the hotel room, smirking as she carried him across the lobby and into the elevator and up to their floor, and even held him while she unlocked the hotel door. She just heaved him up with one of her mighty large shoulders and before Greg knew it, he was gazing up adorably at Kim, who took her fake sideburns and mustache off in the bathroom with a special solution. She washed her face thoroughly. She looked so smooth. <br />
<br />
The next thing they knew, they were both yawning and awake. Greg blinked. There he was. Wait. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kim&quot; he cried out in Kim&#39;s voice. He sat up in bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my GOD, it&#39;s actually happened!&quot; Kim got up and ran tot he bathroom. &quot;WHOOHOO!!! OH, THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME! I LOOK FUCKING RUGGED AND MANLY NOW! NO ONE IS EVER GONNA FUCK WITH ME LOOKING LIKE THIS! HELL YEAH!&quot; <br />
<br />
Greg wandered over to a mirror. &quot;We finally totally swapped. I look just like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH yeah, and you are really fucking hot, baby!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kim came over and grabbed Greg&#39;s breasts. &quot;And these babies belong to my hands now! Hahaha! No, I&#39;m only joking, babe. Come on, have a sense of humor. We look just like the couple that came here now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about switching back? We need to find the magician.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kim thought about it. &quot;Why don&#39;t we get dressed and then go get some breakfast. I want a steak. Would you like steak?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think all I&#39;m in the mood for is something light like a salad again,&quot; Greg said, rather self=pityingly. Kim didn&#39;t notice. <br />
<br />
He trailed after his former body, again reminding his former wife and now husband that she had to slow down for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right! Well, you&#39;re all the way down there! I&#39;ll have to get used to that!&quot; Kim exclaimed. Everything about being a man was a solid benefit, she had decided. <br />
<br />
Greg silently listened as his former body with his former voice talked on and on about whatever he wanted. <br />
<br />
He. He&#39;s a real he now! <br />
<br />
&quot;Should we have a conversation about pronouns?&quot; he asked her after they got back to the hotel room. &quot;I mean, until we switch back.&quot; Kim rubbed his new stubble. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Of course. But yes, we should probably figure out names and such. Look, I think I should just go by Greg from now on,&quot; the former Kim told him. &quot;It&#39;s just too weird for me to call you Greg, especially in public. For now, let&#39;s just call each other by our body&#39;s name. And I will go with he/him pronouns. You&#39;ll go with she/her. Okay? Is that enough for a conversation?&quot; Before the former Greg could even answer, his new husband was all over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You up for a noontime fuck, sweetie?&quot; The New Greg ran his hands through his new wife&#39;s hair. &quot;You&#39;re very pretty. I like that. I like pretty girls now. I like to fuck girls now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Girls, he had said, the former Greg noted. Not WOMEN but GIRLS. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a woman now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what a hot woman you&#39;ve become. You need to learn to use makeup a little better, but I&#39;ll help you with that. Just think how hot we&#39;ll look together, publicly, you draped on MY arm, me walking in a suit. A suit! I haven&#39;t worn a SUIT yet! Oh, I&#39;m going to get to wear a man&#39;s suit! This is so exciting!&quot; <br />
<br />
He cockily strutted his stuff around her and spanked her on the ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;You got any problems, I&#39;m going to take care of them. I&#39;m the man now, after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just...had no idea how powerful my body was and...you&#39;re so different in my body. I don&#39;t understand any of this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe I&#39;m just getting comfy, hmm? All that testosterone is flowing through me, right? Now...about that quickie...&quot; <br />
<br />
As the former Greg, now going to have to respond to KIM, was pummeled by his husband&#39;s new unrelenting dick, he thought...what if I get pregnant? I&#39;d love to have his babies. He&#39;s so big and strong, he can take care of me! <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t help having those thoughts as Greg gave her another few rounds. He was taking such pleasure in his new dick. As he walked to the bathroom, he had a spring to his step. <br />
<br />
Finally, I have Greg&#39;s face. She looked at her image. Handsome. 30 years old. Not too old or young. Handsome. Almost painfully so, with enough crags in her face to give her some authority. Deep stubble. I have to shave my face! He blinked. He didn&#39;t know how to shave his face! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey honey. I want to use a few of your ideas about things to enjoy about being a man. Let&#39;s go to the gym. I feel like a really good workout where I lift weights with these puppies.&quot; He posed arrogantly in front of his new wife. <br />
<br />
Something is happening here, the former Greg thought. He got dressed to go to the gym. Why do I just want to do everything he suggests? Kim was never this compliant. She always liked to contribute ideas and make suggestions but now he&#39;s making all of them and making all the decisions and I&#39;m just...going along with it. Something is wrong! <br />
<br />
But then he heard his husband&#39;s voice to hustle it up and moved more quickly so that he didn&#39;t displease Greg....</p>
