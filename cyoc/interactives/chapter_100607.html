<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When little Charlotte woke up the following morning she instantly felt disoriented. Everything looked far larger than it had any right to be and her vision seemed hazy. Charlotte was comfy though, that much she was satisfied with at the moment. She just considered this part of the hangover coming from the horrible nightmare that drugged up was experience last night was. <br />
<br />
Little Charlotte failed to realize that she actually had no idea what any of those words actually meant as she laid herself back down to sleep. The little girl would have peacefully fallen back asleep too if her pull-up hadn&#39;t crinkled as she turned over. <br />
<br />
Reality hit the last remnants of  Charlotte&#39;s adult mind like a brick wall. She pulled off her bed cover and discovered that she had reentered a time in her 25 years of life that she had the barest of memories of ever experiencing: Toddlerhood. <br />
<br />
Little Charlotte was dressed in light blue jammies adorned with the princesses from Frozen. Indeed, little Charlotte&#39;s whole room was Frozen themed, from her toddler bed to the toys carefully placed around the room that the girl could easily reach at her convenience.  In her adult life, Charlotte would have been hard pressed to admit that she liked Frozen; but the woman turned little girl would not have that problem now. But off all the sights that had rocked little Charlotte&#39;s brave new world, it was the one forming at the crouch of jammies. <br />
<br />
Charlotte had wet herself.<br />
<br />
The toddler girl responded the only way that seemed reasonable to her, she cried.<br />
<br />
The cries seemed foreign to her, the kind of noise that would have annoyed the hell out of her when she was working on the streets but she nonetheless continued the onslaught of tears until she could taste them on the edge of her little mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I see that someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.&quot; said a humming voice that swiftly entered the room.<br />
<br />
Charlotte knew this woman, this heavenly angel that rescued her from the pitiable existence that was her adulthood. She had a name just like little Charlotte did but for some reason she was supposed to call her something else, and so she did. &quot;Mommy!&quot; Charlotte cried<br />
<br />
The angel that was mommy looked down on Charlotte with the most caring of eyes, &quot;Oh yes sweetie pie! Mommy is here for you!&quot; <br />
<br />
This woman would make the whole world better for Charlotte, she just knew it. &quot;I wet!&quot; she tired to explain to her new mom. The task was incredibly taxing on her grownup mind. Words and phrases that she swore she knew dissipated in meaning as she tried to utter them to the calming woman looking down on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just look at you honey!&quot; mommy said as he looked at Charlotte&#39;s crouch, &quot;You soil yourself like a princess! Let&#39;s get you changed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Little Charlotte was picked up by mommy and she once again saw the world from the height of a grownup, if felt foreign to her. Yet foreign still was the changing table that mommy laid her down on. Mommy gently undressed her, taking off her jammies before finally pulling her wet pull-up out from under her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Charlotte, you are just the best little baby girl there ever was! I can&#39;t wait for you to see yourself!&quot; mommy sang to her. <br />
<br />
Charlotte was so flushed from the kindness of her mommy&#39;s words that she didn&#39;t know how was was supposed to respond to them. Fortunately for her, mommy didn&#39;t need a response as the woman bent down towards Charlotte&#39;s bellybutton and blew a raspberry. Charlotte was giddy with glee and her laughs filled with the house with a wondrous joy. By the time she finally recovered her mommy had already cleaned and diapered her in another pull-up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you need anything more than your pull-up for the day don&#39;t you think Charlotte? We&#39;re all family here and you just have the most wonderful little tushy that you should show off to your daddy and big brother!&quot; Mommy reasoned as she once again picked up little Charlotte and brought her before a mirror in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like the new look princess?&quot; mommy asked her.<br />
<br />
Charlotte just loved the adorable little toddler that she had become. Her hair was back to its natural golden brown look and she just loved the way it cascaded straight down her neck just like mommy styled her hair. She also couldn&#39;t get enough of her face it was just too cute, it was perfectly soft and round. Her baby fat was perfectly proportioned throughout her body, giving her the visual delight in her toddler body without being unhealthy looking.  Before her was the baby girl she sometimes dreamed of raising herself in her previous grownup life, but now she was that perfect baby girl. Charlotte reveled in the irony of this fulfillment. So much so that she slowly raised her thumb, pressed it into her mouth, and sucked on it. It felt so rewarding, it tasted like paradise, and it reminded her of something she used to suck on silly guys when she was a silly grownup herself.<br />
<br />
None of that really mattered to Charlotte however, she was just enjoying the sensation of her oral fixation. Mommy had other ideas though, before she knew it. Mommy had taken out her thumb and pressed a pacifier into little Charlotte&#39;s mouth. Charlotte was shell-shocked at first, what was this thing? But instinct soon took over and she found herself sucking away on the pacifier just like she gave blowjobs only a couple days ago. She wrapped her tongue around the pacifier, twisted it, licked it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you found your new best friend there sweetheart.&quot; Mommy said. Charlotte couldn&#39;t agree more. <br />
<br />
Soon after, mommy introduced her to her daddy and big brother Jack. She was distracted at first by her pacifier, until she was held and hugged by her daddy and then placed in Jack&#39;s lap. Little Charlotte began to love them just like mommy. Some time later, little Charlotte found herself strapped into a high chair eating away at cereal and apple sauce while her new family ate breakfast. <br />
<br />
Mommy and daddy explained to her that she was 2 years old now but still had her naughty grownup memories. Gosh that seemed shocking to little Charlotte. She had been such a big grownup lady and now she was nearly starting her whole life over again. She loved the idea. Her big brother Jack even told her that he used to be a silly grownup just like she had been and that mommy and daddy were going to raise them properly this time around. On top of it all, they told her her new last name. Charlotte Sunderland liked it, it was very pretty. <br />
<br />
During the family&#39;s talk she couldn&#39;t help but wonder why she even understood her family in the first place. She was just a toddler after all and every time she tried to say some big girl word it just could never come out. Charlotte cut herself some slack, she was only 2 years old after all, still a baby to the world at large. Daddy assured her that she was going to grow up again just like any other baby and that all that money he promised her and more was going to be hers when she grew up again. But all that money just seemed like icing on top of the cake for Charlotte now, she was just proud that her daddy was keeping his end of the deal to her. <br />
<br />
Later in the day, Charlotte was placed in a play pen on the porch as her family enjoyed themselves outside. She experimented with the limits of her new body for a bit before moving on to playing with her new toys but they didn&#39;t hold her interest long. She wanted to play with her new family, but there was time for that and so much more in the future. Little Charlotte had a lot of growing up to do and she had fully committed to taking it one step at a time, allowing her adult awareness and mind to fully enjoy the day to day pleasures that waited in her return to babyhood. <br />
<br />
Charlotte plugged her pacifier into her mouth and sucked away, wondering how many more silly grownups like her were going to join the Sunderland family.</p>
