<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was digging through his dad's wardrobe, seeing if he could find a shirt big enough to fit his new husky <br />
frame but so far, the first shirt he'd found was the biggest. After the 10th shirt he tried on ripped at the <br />
seams, he sat on the bed in frustration. He heard a loud rip and saw that the jeans he thought fit him now had <br />
a huge hole in the back. The same went for the underwear he was wearing. With a gruff sigh, he tore them off <br />
and stood in the nude again, feeling a lot more comfortable. All the clothes felt so constricting, and kept <br />
rubbing his new body hair the wrong way. He gave up trying to get his dad's clothes to fit him, and glanced <br />
down the hallway. His bedroom door was still closed which meant Matt was still in there, waiting for his non-<br />
existent younger self to finish showering. He wouldn't be able to trick him for long before Matt would <br />
inevitably start questioning exactly who he was. He quietly sneaked past the door, then ran down the stairs, <br />
his dick and balls swinging freely. His parents had received some second-hand clothing from distant relatives <br />
a few weeks back. Maybe he'll find something there.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Matthew was starting to get impatient. It had only been about three minutes, which happened to be <br />
the time he set the temporal hand to on the clock, but it felt like forever. His clothes were starting to feel <br />
a bit tight, but he remembered he went through a growth spurt recently. He must of put on the wrong clothes. <br />
His thoughts turned to his friend's uncle, John. He was wearing clothes too small for him as well. He <br />
remembered how his shirt had rid up his body as he moved, exposing more and more of his hairy stomach. The <br />
thought of it gave him a funny feeling in his groin. He wondered how hairy the man was. He recalled there was <br />
a bunch of chest hair that stuck out from John's shirt, so much hair that it looked like it connected to the <br />
man's beard. Matt undid his shorts as they were starting to feel tight on him. He discovered it was because <br />
his penis was erect, now surrounded by a small patch of hair. His older brother had once shown him what to do <br />
about that, but he couldn't do that right now in Jake's room, could he?<br />
<br />
Jake's frustration was growing. Most of the second-hand clothes in the garage were much too small for him. <br />
They would of fit him perfectly when he was ten, but he wouldn't even be able to pull them over his thirty <br />
year old head. Luckily he had found an oversized pair of pants in the bag that must of been placed there by <br />
mistake. He pulled them on, and they were just big enough to fit him, albeit looking baggy around his legs. It <br />
was better than nothing and he could buy some better fitting clothes later in the day, assuming he was able to <br />
get rid of Matthew. Speaking of which, he hadn't heard a peep from his friend since he went upstairs. He was <br />
never normally this patient. Jake found this suspicious. Maybe he'd already discovered he wasn't in the shower <br />
after all and had gone to call the cops? He dug through the bag of clothes again, but couldn't find a <br />
misplaced shirt to match the pants. He rubbed the hair on his chest before deciding he didn't need to wear <br />
one. Matt had already seen some of his stomach, it's not going to scar him to see the rest of his body. He <br />
left the garage to check on his friend.<br />
<br />
Matt was laying on his friend's bed, his clothes had ripped in places where he'd grown too big for them. But <br />
it didn't matter to him, as he masturbated to the thought of the bearded man downstairs. A stray thought <br />
reminded him of when he'd taught his younger brother how to jack off 2 years ago, telling him to keep it a <br />
secret from his parents. He smirked at the thought, he was only 13 at the time. To think how much he'd grown <br />
since then now he was 15. His thoughts got back to his friend's uncle, thinking about the hair coating his <br />
oversized arms and up into the sleeves that were almost starting to tear, when suddenly the bedroom door flew <br />
open. He had no time to cover himself, seeing the man he was fantasizing about entering the room. He was <br />
topless, showcasing his bulging muscles and incredibly hairy torso. The man stood there for a moment with a <br />
look of shock.<br />
<br />
Jake entered his bedroom to check on his friend, only to find a teenager sprawled out on his bed, his former <br />
clothes surrounded him in tatters and his hand wrapped around his cock. He paused for a moment before yelling <br />
&quot;Fuck! you need to get out of here now!&quot;. The teenager couldn't look any more embarrassed, opening his mouth <br />
to say something but nothing came out. He seemed too embarrassed to move. Jake came further into the room and <br />
grabbed him by the arm, dragged him out amid sounds of protest. By the time they'd left the room, Jake had <br />
aged another 4 months, gaining him a few more grey hairs in his beard along with a couple around his temples <br />
and in his chest hair. His hairline had receded back an extra sixth of an inch. He slammed the bedroom door <br />
behind him before turning towards his squirming friend who was now much closer in height to him. He let go of <br />
his arm, and Matt shouted at him.<br />
<br />
Matt was so angry with the man he previously admired for some reason. What gave him the right to do that to <br />
him? He start shouting &quot;What the fuck do you think you're doing? You can't just fucking drag me out of there! <br />
It's not like you haven't ever...&quot; Matt paused, thinking his voice sounded off. He coughed to clear it and <br />
resumed shouting &quot;It's not like you...&quot;. His voice still sounded wrong. It was deeper, cracking at random. He <br />
rubbed his throat, feeling a large lump where there was previously nothing. Then he noticed his arms. They <br />
were a lot longer, with a slight layer of hair, and his hands looked huge compared to how they normally were. <br />
He looked back at the hairy man, now aware they were almost at eye level with each other. He was confused. <br />
What had happened to him? He glanced downwards seeing his mostly naked taller body, his clothing now rags <br />
hanging off his rather gangly frame. His cock was still throbbing from his interrupted session, and he wished <br />
it would turn flacid. Then he realised just how different he was. The guy probably thought he was some pervert <br />
breaking in for a thrill. With those muscles, he could probably beat the crap out of him without breaking a <br />
sweat. He started to plead with the man. &quot;Shit, I can explain! It's going to sound stupid, but I'm really <br />
Matt. That kid you let in earlier. Something made me grow and I don't know what. You gotta believe me!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake couldn't help but laugh at his friend's sudden change in tone. Matt gave him a sad look, thinking he <br />
didn't believe him. After Jake had calmed down, he joked &quot;Oh I totally believe you Matt. I doubt anybody else <br />
would even attempt to do that in my room&quot;. <br />
<br />
Matt was confused. &quot;Your room? So you mean...&quot;. <br />
<br />
A smile broke through Jake's beard and he replied &quot;I'm not Jake's uncle, It's really me.&quot;. He felt so relieved <br />
to finally tell his friend, who was now staring slack-jawed at him. <br />
<br />
Matt couldn't believe the man he'd been jacking off to earlier was really his best friend now 20 years older. <br />
He tried not to believe it, but his own body was proof. Matt asked &quot;You're Jake? But you're so old&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jake laughed some more and replied &quot;hey, I'm only 30 years old. It's only, what, double your age?&quot;. There was <br />
an awkward pause as the statement sunk in. Jake started to scratch the hair on his pecs nervously, waiting for <br />
his friend to answer. <br />
<br />
Eventually, Matt stepped closer to Jake, then violently punched him in the arm. &quot;That's for making me wait at <br />
the cinema for an hour, making us miss the first showing like we said we'd do&quot;. He then punched him in the <br />
other arm. &quot;And that's for making me 5 years older by sticking me in your room!&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I'm sorry but it's not like I wanted to be my parent's age either. I don't even know what made us older <br />
in the first place. It just sort of happened&quot; Jake responded, struggling to alleviate the pain in both his <br />
arms. &quot;At least we know the source is somewhere in my room. That's something right?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake absent-mindedly played with his beard, lightly tugging the end. Matt noticed this and said &quot;Hey, what's <br />
it like having a beard?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake pulled his hand away and put it behind his head. Rubbing the back, he noted that the hair felt less thick <br />
than it normally did, but he'd deal with that later. &quot;Oh, it's cool I guess. I thought it'd be weird when I <br />
first saw it, but it's nice to play with. It's soothing to stroke when thinking too. It's like the rest of my <br />
body. I feel quite natural being so hairy, like I've been this way for longer than I really have&quot;. He <br />
awkwardly grinned at his friend, trying not to look at the teen's cock, which was still sticking out towards <br />
him. &quot;So how do you think we should stop this? We might end up old men if we go in again&quot;.<br />
<br />
They both pondered this. They didn't even know what made them older. Neither of them realised they were aging <br />
when inside the room and only noticed when they left. Something had to be done quick if they wanted things to <br />
get back to normal.</p>
