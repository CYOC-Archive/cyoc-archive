<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well something must have set my dad off,” Frieda speaking to Spencer and Eric as she overheard the commotion coming from downstairs. “He did warn me,” Frieda looking concerned; “but what ever happened…” Frieda letting the thought trial off as she heard a loud crash; not knowing that Benton just threw his coffee cup at the fridge in pure unbridled anger.<br />
“As long as he doesn’t take it out on you,” Spencer speaking; “I’ve seen enough violence today to not want to tolerate anymore.”<br />
<br />
Frieda gave spencer an icey stare at the computer screen; hearing about what happened to Nate a few hours ago. Eric’s older brother getting attacked by two were-panthers. Listening as Eric and Spencer told her how they witnessed Jean chasing the two while in her fursona back to their car. A car that Spencer quickly totaled with her truck ensuring they couldn’t escape.<br />
“Despite his flaws,” Frieda slowly speaking; “my dad wouldn’t harm me.”<br />
“But from what you are overhearing,” Eric speaking up; “it sounds like he was just as livid during the time you scuttled that takeover bid of Tachibana Enterprises.”<br />
“This is different,” Frieda sighing; “I think it has to with Jack Crawford. Dad warned me I was going to hear some rumors regarding him and his wife tomorrow at school.”<br />
“Speaking of school,” Spencer chiming in; “with my truck totaled, we are going to have to rethink the ride situation.”<br />
“I can have my dad or our driver, pick you two up,” Frieda getting up to grab her pet snake; “I’m sure he will be glad to do it. More so if it give my dad peace of mind,” Frieda letting the snake coil around her arm.<br />
<br />
The skype chat continued with the usual gossip; added along with a little show of Eric entertaining Spencer and Frieda with a strip tease that ended in him shifting into his fursona. Both girls purring as they look at Eric; now in his white furred were-panther form. Spencer was the next to shift; black fur erupting all over her body as her face shifted into and amalgamation of a canine and feline muzzle. Spencer was a werewolf/panther/feline hybrid; rare in the were community, rarer still as her mother was a were-panther/feline hybrid. Her vivid green eyes and triangular like ears moving about as she enjoyed the show Frieda gave.<br />
<br />
Frieda was already in a bathrobe when the skype chat began; but when it was her turn to shift into her fursona, Frieda shucked of the enveloping garments just as her body shifted. Grey fur with russet highlights cover her body as her hands and feet morphed to be more paw like. Her face becoming more feline as whiskers sprouted from her muzzle. Frieda’s ears taking on a more rounded appearance as they migrated to the top of her head. Her green eyes flashing as she murred; the sensation of changing into her were-panthress form pleasant and somewhat orgasmic, Frieda was running her paws all over her furry body as Spencer and Eric were busy pleasuring themselves respectively.<br />
“I better not go any farther,” Spencer forcing herself to remove her paw from her breast and snatch; “I don’t want to wake my baby brother with my yowling and howling.”<br />
“Nor your parents I take it,” Frieda also stopping her pleasuring; “they must be exhausted after looking after Evan Jr.”<br />
“My mom is,” Spencer speaking; “but my dad had to rush out the door an hour ago. Something about an emergency meeting at Tachibana’s.”<br />
“I wonder if that has to do with why my dad is currently pissed off,” Frieda wondering.<br />
“I guess we’ll find out tomorrow,” Eric sporting a smile through his muzzle; both Spencer and Frieda see through their computer monitors Eric cleaning up a mess. It didn’t take a genius to know he went all the way with self-pleasuring.<br />
“You feel better now,” Spencer shaking her head.<br />
“A little,” Eric answering; “having to watch you two get in on in the woods earlier today has left me feeling pent up.”<br />
“It’s your fault for making that wager,” Frieda chuckling; “the first of us to orgasm getting your shaft.”<br />
“You should know by now Eric,” Spencer giggling lowly; “use girls know our bodies intimately and where our pleasure spots are. It doesn’t hurt that Frieda’s and mine are nearly identical.”<br />
<br />
Before Eric could come back with a comment; his ear’s swivel and twitch indicating he heard something.<br />
“It’s my parents,” Eric not sounding concerned; “guess they are back from the hospital.”<br />
“Is Nate going to be okay,” Spencer speaking; “last I saw he was pitching a fit from having to take an ambulance ride to get checked out.”<br />
“I’ll let you know tomorrow,” Eric shrugging his furry shoulders; “we’ll talk then okay?”<br />
<br />
Frieda watched as Spencer nodded; nodding as well as Eric and Spencer disconnected from the private skype channel Frieda had set up. Getting up from her computer; Frieda puts Ralph back in his terrarium, the mouse she placed in there earlier still alive. Frieda knew her pet rat snake will eventually eat the tiny critter as she closes the terrarium. Leaving her room to head downstairs to the kitchen to grab a snack before bed; Frieda notices the dent on the fridge door and her father cleaning up broken pieces of ceramic.<br />
“Careful,” Benton speaking; “it’s not broken glass, but ceramic shards can be just as sharp.”<br />
“Bad news,” Frieda looking at her father cleaning up while in his fursona.<br />
“Nothing you need to be worried over,” Benton sighing; “shouldn’t you be going to bed soon?”<br />
“In a bit,” Frieda opening the fridge door; “just wanted a snack first.”<br />
“You were on your skype for an awfully long time,” Benton getting up; “what were you discussing with Eric and Spencer.”<br />
<br />
Grabbing the leftover tuna salad as she licks her lips; the smell of the fish making the were-panthress salivate. Frieda grabs a fork from the drawer as she hopes onto a stool, intent on polishing off the leftovers.<br />
“Eric’s brother was attacked,” Frieda shoveling the tuna salad in her maw.<br />
“Lance told me,” Benton sitting on a stool next to Frieda; “he also told me that Jack Crawford and his wife ran out of town. Ignoring the summons scrolls Tachibana gave them earlier today.”<br />
“Is that why I heard you shouting earlier,” Frieda looking at her father.<br />
“No it was something else your uncle informed me of,” Benton answering; “don’t worry about it. I’ll be dealing with it promptly tomorrow.”<br />
“Speaking of Tomorrow,” Frieda finishing up her snack; “Spencer totaled her truck stopping the men who attacked Nate from fleeing. I’m going to need a ride for school tomorrow. Can you have John stop by at Eric’s and Spencer’s as well?”<br />
“I had an appointment tomorrow morning,” Benton answering; “but that got cancelled, so I can drive you.”<br />
“Can you pick up Eric and Spencer as well,” Frieda looking at her father.<br />
“I suppose,” Benton sighing; “but you need to go to bed.”<br />
<br />
Frieda kissed her father as she got up from the stool. Benton watched as she put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and dashed off upstairs. Despite his calm façade, Benton was roiling with rage on the inside.<br />
‘You went too far Crawford,’ Benton seething as he got up; ‘going after my daughter’s trust fund. Trying to ruin her financially; that I will not forgive.’</p>
