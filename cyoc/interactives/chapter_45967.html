<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Tracy stared at Misty, her eyes now glowing a slight cyan with power and energy just as her sister's were.  The feeling of Gen still inside of her felt good, and she could feel with her muscles as she squeezed his cock deep within him, his seed filling up her form with energy.  It was so strange and new, and such a departure from what she had always know.</p>

<p>Gen leaned forward over Tracy, some of his energy returning to him.  He licked up her thick abs up her stomach and up to her left breast.  Nipped her fur there, and he placed his lips over her nipple, lightly sucking.  She let out a soft moan as he moved his left hand up behind her head and through her hair, and running his right hand over the side of her muzzle lovingly.</p>

<p>Tom had to take a moment to realize he was not this character.  It had been so different, so good, but he had never felt the things like he felt now.  He had liked it, it was true… but what did that mean?  What he gay.  No.  He didn't want to have a man's dick inside him <i>as</i> a man… but as a woman, he'd really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"You didn't answer me," Daniel's voice came through the air from teamspeak as Misty was given more attention by Worg, his hands moving over her breasts, his muzzle nuzzling into her neck.  "Did you enjoy it?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was a tone in his voice that concerned Tom.  If he said yes, then Dan would know that there was something to this.  If he said no, then Dan might claim he was being untruthful.  In the end, Tom said, "I don't know.  It was so strange," which was the truth.</p>

<p>"I can't wait to try out our new powers," Daniel noted as Misty ran her hands behind Worg's head, moving his face over her right breast for him to take a que from Gen.  He lovingly licked around the edges of her nipple before setting his mouth down upon it, slowly sucking.  "Though this is good too," Dan admitted, and Misty smirked at Tracy.</p>

<p>The two laid there for some time, the energy fading into the background of their feelings.  Daniel made a sigh over teamspeak and said, "I think we're going to be stuck this way for a while.  I'm going to check out a different character.  You coming?"</p>

<p>"I dunno… I didn't get my full nap in Studyhall yesterday," Tom began across teamspeak.  "I think I'll just head to bed so I can be more rested for school," he noted, though it was untrue.  He wanted some time to think over what had happened.</p>

<p>"Bah, that guy just wore you out.  But, whatever, I hear ya.  I'm going to go back to the character select screen," Dan said.  "I know you hate playing girls, so I'll make sure not to pick the guy of any of the remaining linked accounts," Dan said.  "Later, bro," he said and put in a command on his end to allow Misty to be on auto-pilot while he was off.  That meant that nothing big or important would happen while he was away and that the relationship of Misty and the NPC would remain the same while he was gone (presuming he returned in one week's time, after which she would merely fade to the background).</p>

<p>As Tom saw Misty's eyes loose that 'live player' look to them (which is hard to notice unless you're looking for it), he quickly tapped Tracy's fingers along Gen's back in a motion that brought up his status and friend's screens over his view.  Once there, he put himself on Global Hide so it would look like he had signed off to his brother.</p>

<p>Tracy reached forward, running her hands over Gen's back and down to his buttocks.  She squeezed his muscular ass, and felt him stiffen inside her.  Such a strange feeling, but it did feel good.  So pleasurable.  She was sure than Tom had creamed his suit back in the real world, but she didn't care.</p>

<p>"Gen," she said softly in his wolfen ear, "Feed from the energy," she said as she called upon experienced that Tom had as a mystic before.  Gen looked up into her eyes, then placed his lips over her other nipple.  It brought another slight gasp from her as he began sucking once again, slowly at first.</p>

<p>Tracy willed some of the energy she'd been granted to renew itself within the warmth of her body.  She focused it into her chest, and began to feel a milky essence leaving her and into Gen's mouth.  He fed on that energy, and his form hardened inside of her, his muscles growing tight with new found physical power.</p>

<p>"Bound as we are, let us keep this bond for longer," Tracy said with a grin, running a hand up under Gen's chin, and turning his face just a bit so she could look into his eyes.  "Take me again," she smiled, and Gen shared that goal just then.</p>

<p>He raised her legs up to either side of him as he knelt in front of her once more, and he slowly began to motion against her, his body pulling and pushing on her as his knot continued to bind them.  Tracy wrapped her legs around him, and wondered if Gen might be able to make it yet again.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was lunch time before Tom knew it.  He was sitting across from Daniel, but staring at an open Algebra II book on the table.  He was doing his best to focus on the page and ignore Daniel as he didn't want the look on his face to reveal him thinking of anything else.</p>

<p>Luckily, this was easy to do.  Charles had come over at sat down next to Daniel, and he was talking with him about Doug being able to join the group.  They were talking at length about the different stories they had heard across Broadcast within the The Kingdom's OOC Chat Channel about the different things people were ending up playing as.</p>

<p>As Tom understood what he heard from them, the situation in Game was creating anger and distrust of the MMO in the media outlets like Fox News who were claiming everything from Rape, Incest, Child Pornography, and more.  People being 'forced' to be things they didn't choose to be.</p>

<p><i>Silly,</i> Tom thought, <i>because no one </i>has<i> to sign-in while PHUK was mal-phuk-tioning.</i>  He smirked, <i>I wonder how many people out there are finding things they would have never tried before,</i> he added inside his head, thinking on the early morning adventure he'd had as Tracy.</p>

<p>PHUK is not a realistic Game, to be sure, but Tom was still surprised that Tracy had had enough energy to power Gen through four total couplings.  The main downside was Lycanis (the name of the Canis Sapien race) mated for children first, power second, and rarely for pleasure… and given how much energy was transmuted back and forth between Tracy and Gen, the likeliness of him playing a pregnant female character in the weeks ahead would be great.</p>

<p>That was, of course, assuming the Game stayed broken that long.  <i>I hope they don't fix The Kingdom before I get home,</i> Tom realized.  <i>I'd love to see Gen again… if only to say goodbye.</i></p>
