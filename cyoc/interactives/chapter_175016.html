<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I woke up, I was in my bed, well, on my bed as I was sleeping on top of my covers. And I was naked too... Someone, likely Diana, had sent us back home for some reason. I move my hand down to hold my cock only to find it gone. &quot;Huh, what the fuck is wrong with me?&quot; I say to myself jokingly. Not finding my cock and balls protruding from my crotch had brought with it a sad feeling of loss. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, did I really enjoy having them that much?&quot; I thought to myself. I already knew the answer to that question though. Yes, I actually really loved having them. And now that they were gone, it was like a part of me was missing. Even though it was only here for several hours, it had already become a core part of me. <br />
<br />
Well, I am sure I will see the others soon enough. And I wonder how things will be between us now? Will kind of took the reigns yesterday and then somehow things lead to an all out orgy. Speaking of which, how will Tom handle all of this. He was turned into a girl too, and then made into Will&#39;s wife. I know that I can&#39;t blame Will for that, but it still doesn&#39;t sit well with me. Whats worse is that I now also want Willa to be my wife. Or rather, I think I already am considered a member of her harem... and I was the one who kicked it all off too. Fuck. Why does she have to be that attractive of a woman, that I can&#39;t help but want to fuck her? No... she likely just charmed us all. Damn it, that&#39;s so annoyingly cool. I wanted to be the succubus and do things like that. But, I guess Sorcerer isn&#39;t too bad either. Speaking of...<br />
<br />
Rachel had a sudden thought. If she was a sorcerer, couldn&#39;t she just return her horsecock and balls? It was worth a try at least. It took a bit of focusing, but after several attempts, she finally managed to do so. Letting out a sigh of relief, Rachel marveled at her handiwork. Her monstrous cock stood erect with the tio now just below her chin. She could feel her balls churning her cum around as she slowly began to get horny. Which then quickened with every step she took as she walked over to her bathtub in order to masturbate. <br />
<br />
Using her magic, Rachel turned her bathroom into a masturbating paradise. Toys and equipment were everywhere, and all custom made to fit her exact size. There was even a dildo with the exact shape and depth of her pussy, which she didn&#39;t hesitate to stuff inside of her. It was kind of interesting how once it was inside her, it created a nearly seamless seal over her pussy, making it look like it didn&#39;t even exist. She ended up spending the rest of the night and most of the early morning inside that room. It was only when she heard a knocking comming from the balcony of her appartment did she leave it. And she didn&#39;t even bother disguising her cock, or even bother putting on clothes for that matter as she had a strong feeling she knew who it was. Diana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, though it seems like I was interrupting something. I don&#39;t mind helping younout though, if that will make up for it&quot; offered Willa, who had apparently flown here all by herself. I will admit that once I heard her offer to help get me off,  I immediately wanted to accept, but I managed to hold myself together enough to push it off for later. &quot;Uhh, maybe later?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If that is what you want, then fine. I came here to settle any new displeasure between you and me afterall. May I come in?&quot; Politely asked Willa.<br />
<br />
I see, this is Royal Princess mode Willa speaking, not Succubus mode Willa. It made me relax a bit knowing that she wasn&#39;t just here to fuck me like I was just some toy for her amusement. &quot;Sure, please make yourself at home. Want a drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I am fine. But thank you though&quot; Willa replied while walking inside. She then collapsed her wings into her hips and took a seat on the couch, while crossing one leg over the other in a very refined and elegant manner. &quot;Well she is royalty, so I guess that it is to be expected that she can act in such a formal and refined manner&quot; I thought to myself, feeling a bit annoyed for some reason. Likely jealousy, as I did envy her beauty a bit, and her tits. Damn those things are huge. Its so not fair, her flaunting those around, all tucked nicely into her cute bra and everything. Damn I kinda want her to titty fuck me with those pillows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first I want to apologize for claiming Tomasa from you. I understand that you both were dating, and now that she is my fiancee, I feel like there has to be some discontent between us. So, here I am to fix that. If I can, I will do whatever you wish of me as compensation.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Really? Anything, as in literally anything? Like if I said I wanr you to return Tom back into a guy and never touch him again, you would do that for me?&quot; I knew it would be a stretch, but I don&#39;t like sharing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t something I can really do. She wishes for it, as well as to also be your wife too. So I can&#39;t upset her just to make you happy.&quot; Willa could see that her answer didn&#39;t sit well with Rachel, so she offered another idea. &quot;I can however make her prefer to be fucked by you over me, and prefer to just simply pleasure me while you fuck her.&quot; That seemed to do the trick as Rachel&#39;s heavy mood lightened instantly and her cock rose up out of its sheath once again. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is a good start&quot; I said to Willa. &quot;However there is something else I want from you too.&quot; Before I could even say what it was, I found myself laying down on my back, with my cock nestled inbetween Willa&#39;s tits. &quot;Inassume you mean this?&quot; She said as she slowly rocked back and forth over me, sliding my cock up and down between her tits. &quot;Yesss, Mistress!&quot; I shouted, unintentionally calling her Mistress out of habit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you can just call me Willa you know. Only Christina calls me Mistress. Even Diana calls me owner or Willa. So you calling me Mistress is not necessary. Plus do you not find it odd for one wife to call the other wife Mistress when not roleplaying?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean wife? Since when are we wives?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since I said so yesterday. I won&#39;t let any of you leave me, so I consider you all my wives now&quot; explained Willa. Honestly, I really couldn&#39;t care anymore what she called me, as most of my mind had gone back down to my focusing on pleasing my cock like yesterday. And my cock focused mind was enjoying every inch of her tits rubbing up and down my shaft. Willa&#39;s eyes were not even glowing and yet I couldn&#39;t bring myself to fight against her advances. Damn it, I guess that means that I do kinda like her too. Using magic, I check my status and find that not only am I not charmed at all, but I actually have a new title which I bet was not there in the beginning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Horsecocked third wife of the Royal Princess&quot;</p>
