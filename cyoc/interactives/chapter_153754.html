<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, Zach, are you ready to take your new body for a test drive?&quot; Rebecca asked, thinking about ways to do exactly that. She was contemplating whether it would be wise to bring Zach into any place, and decided thus that the gym would be a safe bet. Less chance for him to get taken advantage of than in a bar or club. And just as much chance to show him off. Which she figured he&#39;d be into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, yeah, I&#39;m definitely ready for that...how do you mean?&quot; He put his hands behind his head and subtly flexed his arms - he saw that even with these bigger clothes he was definitely making an impression through them. Did she want him to---? Zach&#39;s eyes darted to her and he blushed a little before looking away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I mean, are you ready to hit the gym, with your new, all buffed out body? Because I&#39;d be up to take you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach felt almost as good with that idea as the alternative his mind had cooked up on its own. The new grown hunk nodded intensely, and smiled wide, &quot;This might be the first time I EVER looked forward to exercise! I mean, look at all this I&#39;ve got going on...I&#39;ll be the chat of the gym!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca was very much enjoying Zach&#39;s enthusiasm, and so as they pulled up to the gym, Rebecca handed him a light grey stringer top and some basketball shorts. Zach looked them over, pondering for a moment, &quot;Wonder how these things are gonna fit on me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out, big guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not ten minutes later, within the gym locker room...<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel naked, Rebecca.&quot; Zach said and shrugged his shoulders. The stringer was loose on him but between the tiny strings and thin fabric on the shirt, and the basketball shorts that just barely went down the middle of Zach&#39;s thighs, it was pretty clear why he would feel that way. Already in the locker room Zach turned and looked, feeling watched in part due to his skimpy clothes.<br />
<br />
He did however center himself and lightly flexed his arms in place. He wasn&#39;t the skinny little kid any more. He was a big, tough looking, muscular man in his...his thirties and he had absolutely no reason to be ashamed of his body or shy to wear these kinds of clothes any more. Zach was after all supposed to be a physique bodybuilder now according to that story he told the woman at the sports store. Better start acting like it.<br />
<br />
Rebecca for her part put a hand on his shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, you&#39;ll do great out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that and his own internal resolve, Zach decided he was done being timid.<br />
<br />
Rebecca and her new bodybuilder beau went out on to the floor, with her noting that Zach was watching how people were doing their exercises as they entered the free weights room. Zach had never seen so many rippling guys before, and Rebecca noted he was still reacting a little twitchy even though he was bigger than most of these guys now. Just, she guessed, the result of years of associating bigger guys with social anxiety and upset.<br />
<br />
Approaching an empty bench, Zach looked over at someone else doing a Flat Back Dumbbell Bench Press, and nodded, &quot;I wanna try that out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rebecca said and looked around, assessing, &quot;Get the fifty fives, just to get your bearings.&quot;<br />
<br />
5 Sets of 10 Reps Dumbbell Bench Press; Zach was feeling on top of his game during the first set, and something about it just resonated so incredibly well with him. He had to go and replace the fifty fives with sixty fives and then seventy fives, leaving an increasingly shocked Rebecca watching as Zach&#39;s brow knitted with sweat and exertion. He was by the end pounding out a drop set at 90 pounds, and let out a thunderous shout / scream as he dropped the weights beside him.<br />
<br />
Rebecca watched it happen and almost couldn&#39;t believe it was still Zach. In fact, she approached him and asked, &quot;...Zach? You&#39;re uh...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...yeah...still me. Just...wow! Wow! I never expected that to feel so good!&quot; Zach got up and by reflex did some stretching right in front of Rebecca, resulting in his teacher looking to the side, hot-faced and trying not to show she was incredibly into the new Zach. He was...he was really, smoking hot.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Zach to want to go on to his next exercise...<br />
<br />
6 sets of 12 reps Barbell Bench Press; Rebecca was left watching as Zach piled on weights. 3 45 lbs plates on each side was by far beyond what she was normally going to think ANYONE would go for. But here he was, getting ready for it. Zach grinned, and shouted, &quot;Watch me go, Ms. Clarkson!&quot;<br />
<br />
And watch she did as Zach pounded out his sets astonishingly well, from the top to the bottom with practiced ease. It was like this was not the first time he&#39;d done this at all. Maybe just watching the guys working out here...or maybe it was something to do with the aging effect.<br />
<br />
By the time Zach was done he was sweating even more and he smirked, that new confidence coming off him almost as much as the heady smell of a man&#39;s exertion, &quot;Damn, this is so good...&quot; He looked around to try and figure out what to do next, and saw some other guy just finishing up with deadlifts.<br />
<br />
And so off he went to go to the deadlift area, &quot;I wanna try that next!&quot; Rebecca was left to hurry along and follow Zach to the deadlift area. She rarely did this in here, and so she was not exactly an expert except for some basic tips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...remember to be careful with your back. Don&#39;t bend at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good, I&#39;m good...&quot; He whispered back to her as he set up, obviously very excited. He decided to get in his &quot;warm up set&quot; at 225 lbs, the two 45 lbs weights going right on, and Zach did some stretches to make sure his back and legs were in good form. Rebecca for her part just watched enrapt as his muscled form flexed and showed striations as he stretched.<br />
<br />
That was when someone else showed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, new guy!&quot; The accent was very slightly German, and both Rebecca and Zach saw a well muscled, slightly pale blond haired young man walk over, grinning and showing off his own muscled build in a tight blue stringer and grey sweat pants. Rebecca guessed he was a pretty boy college student athlete, going by his look. &quot;You ah, you think you&#39;re hot stuff, am I right? I saw your big lifts...hot stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach responded with a rumbling chuckle, and stood up by the new guy, &quot;...Are you saying you think I&#39;m hot?&quot;<br />
<br />
The German guy outright laughed at that, &quot;Yeah, Yeah, that I do. And I wanna test how you and I compare. My name&#39;s Stephen Auberk, you and your lovely lady friend...&quot; he said with a wink at Rebecca, &quot;Can call me Stepp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach crossed his arms and asked, &quot;How do you want to test that kinda thing, Stepp?&quot;<br />
<br />
The German responded, &quot;Of course, what you were just settin&#39; out to do. Deadlift Contest! Whoever can do the most weight wins! We go to five reps. Pretty standard stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach seemed to consider it, and he looked back at Rebecca for a moment as if wondering how she&#39;d take it... She promptly went up to him and whispered, &quot;Go for it, big guy.&quot; That was all that Zach needed - he was gonna do this, which he guessed would be a real test.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Zach said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ll do this deadlift contest. May the best man win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca watched the two of them start to set up their lifts, and considered her options. She looked at Zach and then over at the cocky and...ambiguous Stepp. What to do about this? Should she...?</p>
