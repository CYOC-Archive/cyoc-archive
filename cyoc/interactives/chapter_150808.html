<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is where the chapters start to branch for a while. There will be parallel paths going the same direction and will be converging again later.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ilvir wasn’t sure what he should do. He was finally in control of Isaac’s body, something he wanted for a long time. But he had to deal with an unconscious Mary, whose mind was somewhere in the metaphysical bowels of Isaac’s body.<br />
<br />
But the bigger probably was Nat. She had no idea what was going on other than Mary touched the halo and went unconscious. What was Ilvir supposed to tell her? The truth? Easier said than done. Actually, not so easy to say. What was going on inside Isaac was very hard to explain to someone who hasn’t seen inside of him. And Ilvir wasn’t an educated man. He wasn’t sure at all how to describe the current explanation.<br />
<br />
<i>”Besides, how will she react to knowing that I’m the one controlling the body now? After all, the last time she saw me, I was little more than a sex-crazed spawn who sided with a lust demon that tried to corrupt her hometown. Yeah, I’m pretty sure she’d open to trusting Ilvir. Guess I’m going to have to start feeding her little white lies.”</i><br />
<br />
“Isaac? What just happened? Why isn’t Mary waking up?” Nat’s questions cut through to Ilvir’s attention. He had to give her an answer.<br />
<br />
“I just had to check on something real quick. Mary must have got curious and decided to take a peek.” That was the truth so far, a bit. Ilvir didn’t have to correct her that he isn’t Isaac.<br />
<br />
“Then why is she not awake now?” Nat was looking at the unconscious cloud woman in Ilvir’s arms with concern.<br />
<br />
“She’s learning more about how my body works right now. It may be awhile before she’s finished.” Still mostly the truth. Mary will certainly be learning a lot about Isaac’s body.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t she learn enough earlier?” Nat sounded dubious as she walked beside him. Ilvir looked down to Nat&#39;s petite form, cocking an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“She barely scratched the surface.” Ilvir returned his sight to the cloud path he was treading on. There was nothing false about that one at all.<br />
<br />
Nat sighed. “Well, I’m not sure we should proceed into the mountains with her unconscious. If we’re attacked by wild animals, all of us should be on alert. And you won’t be able to do most of the protecting if you have your arms full.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a good point,” agreed Ilvir, “I guess we should head to a shady spot until Mary decides to wake up.”<br />
<br />
“But it’s half a day’s walk to the foot of that first mountain, at least,” protested Nat.<br />
<br />
“The mountain’s not going anywhere. Besides, I don’t think Mary will be that long. I’d give her...an hour. Maybe two.” Ilvir wasn’t exactly sure how long it would take Isaac and Dark Isaac to get Mary out, but it couldn’t be longer than a day, surely.<br />
<br />
Nat gave an annoyed groan. “Of all the times to… Fine. I need to plot out which path we’ll be taking through the mountains anyways.”<br />
<br />
Ilvir inwardly sighed with relief. At least Nat was buying it for the time being. He just hoped Mary would be recovered before Nat loses patience. “Let’s find a quiet place then.”<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Ilvir had thought that walking with Isaac’s body would be a challenge, considering how inhuman it was built not. But he adapted a lot easier than he thought he would. Even carrying Mary’s body was no burden at all with his immense strength.<br />
<br />
But there was one little problem. Ilvir was getting bored and boredom was turning his thoughts towards sex. He was more than just some granite spawn who lived for his master’s cock, so he could control himself. However, he was finding it hard to turn himself off. It didn’t help that the dragonling suckling from him was a constant source of arousement. But then again, Chirp was probably the only reason Isaac didn’t leave a trail wherever he went.<br />
<br />
As he got hornier, his thoughts towards his female companions became dirtier. <i>”Mary’s getting pretty sexy. I mean, for a cloud, she’s pretty good-looking. And I think her curves are getting bigger. Pretty sure she definitely has a bigger bust. Must be part of that cloud puberty. But she won’t have nipples or a slit until then. That’s a stupid design. I can’t wait until Isaac finally plows this girl. That’s something I’d like to be part of.”</i><br />
<br />
Ilvir glanced over at Nat. <i>”But look at her. Skinny as a tree, flat as a plank. When is she going to start blooming already? Such a waste of cloud flesh. Although, she still has her mouth…”</i> Ilvir pulled himself out of his thoughts. They were starting to get a little too creepy. One thing is for sure, this body needed release in a big way.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they came across a small clearing, with large trees in a circle not too far from a stream. Ivlir was mildly surprised to see running water in this cloud world. He wondered if it ran to the edge of the cloud before falling down as rain. “This looks like a good spot as any.” Nat’s words brought Ilvir back to the current location.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Mary can wait right here.” Ilvir gently laid Mary’s body down, her head resting on a root. Probably not as hard as the roots back home. Of course, thinking ‘hard’ brought Ilvir back to his current need. “I’m sure you two will be fine right here.” Ilvir turned to go.<br />
<br />
“Wait, where are you going?” Nat demanded.<br />
<br />
“Scouting, going to make sure none of the animals here will bother us.” That was probably more lying than the rest. Yes, he’d scout, but his main concern was relieving himself.<br />
<br />
“But I thought you couldn’t move far from Mary because of your bond.” Nat sounded a little bit suspicious.<br />
<br />
“Mary and I are bonded mentally, not physically. As long as our minds are linked, we do have to keep close. But since her mind is in here, I can go wherever I want now.” Ilvir tapped his chest as he explained.<br />
<br />
“You won’t go far, will you?” Nat sounded more worried.<br />
<br />
“I won’t go far,” promised Ilvir, “Mary will probably wake up by the time I’m back.”<br />
<br />
“I hope so.” Nat gave her unconscious friend a concerned look.<br />
<br />
“Try practicing your magic or reading your map,” suggested Ilvir, “That should take your mind off of her.” Not waiting any longer, Ilvir made the titan body walk out of the clearing and deeper into the forest. He needed something to deal with this growing arousal. And he wasn’t sure if he’d be picky about who or what he used.</p>
