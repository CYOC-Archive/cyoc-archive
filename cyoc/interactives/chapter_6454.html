<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke was a little unsure about the teating and study of sexual enhancements. He felt his sex life to he for one and one ultimate mate only!<br />
<br />
As he sat on the Doctor's exam table he watched as seringe after seringe was filled with different liquids.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will bother a little!&quot; announced the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Luke watched as two seringes emptied into his right upper arm. Then his eyes widened as the Doctor picked up Luke's penis and shot an injecting into the flared end of his most sensual part.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we're done for today! Now return home and pack your things for returning to the Facility tomorrow. This primary study is only to last for three weeks. The resulting enhancement and it's study will take up much of the Summer.  You room here will be ready to occupy tomorrow! I expect you and Ike will see little of the other till mid Summer.&quot; explained the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Luke dressed and made his way out to the waiting area for meeting Ike. An hour passed and then two but no Ike. Luke began to wonder and worry as he watched the clock. At last he could stand it no more, getting up he walked over to the phone on the corner table and dialed up the operator.<br />
<br />
Luke asked for the Doctor by name and was told no Doctor by that name worked for the Research Lab. Now Luke was worried and angry. The steel door was locked tight and even after his repeated knocking he never recieved an answer.<br />
<br />
Sitting down he sat for hours till a security guard stepped out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I'm waiting for my friend Ike!&quot; said Luke quickly.<br />
<br />
The guard smiled and asked if Ike was a hardy blonde haired lad? &quot;Yes, you must be Luke, I'm told to tell you that Ike was choosen by his muscle bound size for a Stout Study and due to his injections the enhancement was already beginning, does that help you to understand?&quot; asked the Guard.<br />
<br />
Still concerned Luke walked out the front glass door of the Lab as he heard the lock click shut behind him. Returning to the apartment hwe was greeted by Mrs. Eddison, the landlord.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening young Luke, I'm told you and Ike are going to work for the Natas Research Company, how nice!  A man came here this afternoon and paid your apartment rents for six months upfront, how nice!&quot; said Mrs. Eddison with her toothless smile.<br />
<br />
Taking the elevator to the third floor and as he entered the apartment he felt tired and weak. Pulling all his junk from the pockets of his pants he flopped onto the couch.<br />
<br />
Lukes eyes opened slowly and he looked about the room. His head felt like it was spinning and both head and gut was making him feel sick. Sitting up he dropped his head between the knees and tried to breath deeply.<br />
<br />
This not helping he stood up but almost lost his balance, he was hot and sweaty. A warm shower seemed the right thing and he walked toward his bedroom.  Soon naked he peered at himself in the bathroom mirror.<br />
A young face looked back at him but was feathered with a growing four day beard. Luke spread his lips to look at the aching teeth, only to see his gums were bleeding as well.<br />
<br />
Turning he stepped into the shower and let the warm water flow over his tired body. As he relaxed his mind seemed to wander and soon found himself sporting a harder that hard erection. Looking down with water in his eyes he saw his stiff penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;The study!&quot; he thought to himself as his penis now stretched more than double in girth, but seemed a little more in length. As he touched his sensual part a shiver of desire pulsed through his body.<br />
<br />
A dribble of liquid soap in hand and he was off stroking the shaft. Harder and stiffer it got till he felt his balls churn and the semen flow. Spurt after glorious sputt flew out the end of his shaft. He jumped from foot to foot as he felt the best release, ever.<br />
<br />
The shower done he dried off but the erection stayed out hard as a board. Again he gave a close look to his face and then to his normally bare chest. Whatt looked like short white hairs were sprouting everywhere, on chest, shoulders, arms, and thighs.<br />
<br />
Tired was Luke and again he laid down naked on the bed and drift off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Ring, ring, went the phone near the bed as Luke rolled over to grab the reciever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke, this the Doctor at Natas Research, are you coming in to start today? I'll send a car for you in an hour, best get up and get going!&quot; and the Doctor hung up.<br />
<br />
Luke peered at the clock with sleepy eyes. 10:36, wow he'd overslept, he felt still funny and had a tough time hanging up the phone. Tucking knees to his chest he rooled to the bedside and sat there for a moment to collect his thoughts.<br />
<br />
The room seemed full of strange scents. Luke took a deep breathe and then released it only to hear a very strange sound. As sleepy eye blinked out the blurred sights he stood up and suddenly reached for the dresser as his balance was way off.<br />
<br />
Holding on the edge of the dresser Luke peered at himself in the tall mirror. &quot;I look funny!&quot; he said but heard the words as if slurred badly.<br />
<br />
Eyes blinked as blurry vision cleared and Luke stood now struck. Looking back at him was the wooly face of one big sheep. Two silver grayed ram's curling horns sprouted from the top of his head and curled around long floppy ears.<br />
<br />
Cocking his head to the left he saw fingers which looked all too much like small black hooflets. Now he was filled with terror as he tried to yell his dismay only to exclaim a deep throaty BAAAAAAAAAA!<br />
<br />
As Luke held onto the dresser for dear life he lifted his left leg and leaned over to wander what else was so wrong. The sight of a wool covered thigh and belly too made the realization of those white stub hairs the night before. Wool, he was being covered in Sheep wool!<br />
<br />
Stretching his leg out to the side as far as he could it was mostly different. A broad wooled thigh led down to a hunched knee to a true animal hock, foot, and jet black cloven hooves. &quot;That's why it's tough to keep one's balance!&quot; Luke thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Dropping his left leg to again touch the floor he inched his hooves back to stretch his stance. One stretch deserved another and soon he peered into the mirror which gave him the most sensual feeling of desire.<br />
<br />
Like the wiggling of a worm from his woolen belly his damp and oily shaft pushed past the wooled end of his very Sheepish sheath. The coarse wool tickled and sensualized the shaft all the more till it was out straight and stiff. As then the end of his Ram's delight touched the cold wood of the dresser he had a passion build and found himself humping his new cock into the air.<br />
<br />
Semen flew out the end of his cock and with each burst he felt the desire to shoot out more. It was then he heard someone speak and turned to see them standing in the doorway of his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Doctor, Guard 8129, we're at the premises! He's jocked off for his first time, yes, he's almost totally enhanced! OK Doc we'll load him up and be there soon.&quot; said the Guard into his radio.<br />
<br />
As one guard unraveled a burlap sack of one large size the other guard approached Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there fella, we will take you to see the Doc, so be nice!&quot; he said softly as Luke stood erect but calm.<br />
<br />
The Guards slipped the burlap sack over Luke's head and the emotion filled Ram just let things go there merry way.</p>
