<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam Huggevik walked from the camp ground on his directed path. Sam was a good soldier. He followed orders and worked well with his team. It was what he did. He had always followed direction well. He was more of a follower and group member then anything else. Same had recognized that early in life and decided the best path was a career in the military. After a decent, though unremarkable, term in the military he had been approached to enter into the security force for this company. They offered a much larger pay check and full benefits. Not to mention it was much safer doing this kind of work in a company and their was an odd amount of job security as offices were hesitant to fire anyone with military training who worked in security.<br />
    Sam was no fool and he had leaped on the chance. Now two years after, he had regrets. He was doing comfortably well. He wasn’t making a name for himself but he had never really wanted to make a name for himself. What he wanted was to have comfortable job and find a wife and raise a family. So far he had a secure job with good pay but nothing approaching that in his social life. His friends in the team he was assigned to were the closest he got to something like a family and that was tenuous at best.<br />
    Sam moved deeper into the woods his senses at their apex. He was on edge looking about for threats and movement. Then he heard something. It sounded like groaning and moaning. Could it be someone in distress perhaps?<br />
    Sam looked from behind a tree and caught sight of something very strange a wolf man and a wolf woman. They were in a clearing the moon above made them appear like werewolves. For a second he just stared at them. The female, a grey wolf, was moaning and was on the ground in either the deep throes of passion or in pain. The male, a pure white wolf was standing above her with a face of consternation and indecision. He had an obvious erection, but the wolf man didn’t touch it.<br />
    Sam didn’t question this too much he just raised his tracer gun and prepare dot shoot it at them. They would feel a slight pin prick like that of a flea bite and nothing more then he would head back and report finding two anthropomorphic wolves. Just as he was about to fire a hand landed on his shoulder or more precisely a clawed furry paw like hand. Sam turned to see another wolf man this one a deep russet color standing over him. The russet wolf also had an erection. He looked at Sam for a moment. <br />
   “Can you help us?” asked the russet wolf.<br />
   Of all the things Sam was expecting, being asked for help was not one of them. <br />
   “Um, what” said Sam startled. The he heard a rustling and looked to see both the male and female wolves walking towards him.<br />
   “Can you help us” asked the russet male wolf. “We need your help. I think you can help us at least. I mean you don’t smell like prey. You smell sort of like us now, sort of and we really need some help.”<br />
   “With what?” asked Sam now very confused with the situation, but maybe he could think of a way out of it if he kept them talking. Maybe even tag them.<br />
   “I need to be mated” said the female wolf.<br />
   Before Sam could ask what she meant the white wolf began to speak <br />
   “You see our Alpha Male and Female and beta male all went to investigate that odd light that way. Which went away and they haven't come back. But that’s a problem because only the alpha male and female can mate; unless we are given permission. But now she seems in so much need; more then ever before. Because of her need I and my pack mate are in need too. If you fulfill her need though and let us take our need out on you it would solve the problem. You don’t have to, but it’s the only way we can feel better and we need release. We don’t want to break rules after all, especially if your pack mates would forbid it; we respect the rules and those that make them.”<br />
   Sam by now had been very, close to the three wolves physically. His team had not been alerted to the dangers of the creatures’ pheromones which by now Sam had received a heavy dose of. That mixed with his mind’s inner need to follow orders and his deep respect of these three wolves for following orders to such an extreme. Combined it created a chemical cocktail in his brain making the pheromones all the stronger and weakened his resistance to the idea to a minor scratching in the back of his head telling him this was inherently wrong. His resistance was barely a whisper by now. Sam wanted to say yes but he had to wonder if a few more bodies would be useful. Perhaps his good friends in the Recon Group would like to help….</p>
