<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt was down to his last nine inches as he considered his predicament. Even with the giant statues frozen, he could feel the weight of Paul's massive nuts shrinking
<br>
 him smaller and smaller. He walked around to Steve's own monsters which Paul had been licking when everything stopped, his tongue still pressed against the
<br>
 bulging pouch. Matt saw everything slowly continuing to inflate and knew he had to act quickly. &quot;I wish all the other wishes I've said up to now had no further effect
<br>
 on Mr. DeSoto,&quot; Matt said. The world jumped as three more precious inches left Matt, but at that, things finally stopped growing. 
<br>

<br>
 Paul brought his tongue back into his mouth and then was still for a moment, other than his breathing which had suddenly restarted. He blinked and looked at
<br>
 Steve's big genitals right in his face. Just a second ago, this had been his hottest fantasy come true. Now he was suddenly queasy. 
<br>

<br>
 He struggled to get away from the foot-long cock, but realized he was completely pinned. Steve was perfectly motionless -- still frozen, Paul realized -- and heavy.
<br>
 As the fog lifted from Paul's mind, he remembered everything... Matt's first visit, Larry shrinking because of his balls, him shrinking because of Steve's... even being
<br>
 frozen in time by Matt. He struggled against Steve's body again, but it seemed to weigh hundreds of pounds, and the bed was providing no real leverage. &quot;Help,&quot;
<br>
 he managed to squeeze out. None of his kids were home yet, but maybe Matt was still around. 
<br>

<br>
 He felt something tickling his arm, and then small hands and feet crawling through the coarse hair on his front. Turning his neck, he was able to see Matt's tiny form
<br>
 making its way towards his head. &quot;Hey there little fella,&quot; Paul said. He had really mixed feelings about the neighbor kid right this second, but he realized that being
<br>
 nice was a lot more likely to get his height back than trying to act tough. Besides, it was hard to act tough while naked, with Steve's boner in his face, and his own
<br>
 dick just now soft again. &quot;Any chance you can help me up? I'm kinda stuck,&quot; Paul said. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I know what you mean!&quot; Matt shouted. He sat down, his legs lost in Mr. DeSoto's warm fur. &quot;I'm kinda stuck too.&quot; Matt said. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well, let's start by getting me back to normal, and then maybe we can figure this out together,&quot; Paul suggested. 
<br>

<br>
 Matt laughed nervously. &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; he said. &quot;You're already six times my size... once you're un-stuck, you'll probably start by smashing me like a bug.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Paul frowned. He WAS unhappy with having his body and his life hijacked like this. Matt's tiny body shivered against his muscled pecs, whether from fear or cold,
<br>
 Paul wasn't sure. &quot;I understand you're scared,&quot; Paul started. &quot;And I do think you took advantage of me, but I wasn't perfect either when I had the wand. Take a
<br>
 look at this great big penis in my face if you doubt that.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Matt relaxed. &quot;You did seem like you were having a great time,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted you to have fun.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yes,&quot; Paul admitted. &quot;Other than the very beginning, this was loads of fun. But I don't want to be stuck like this, and I doubt you want to be stuck like that. So,
<br>
 wish me back to normal and then I'll wish you back to normal. Then we'll decide what to do with Steve. Deal?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Matt considered his options. &quot;I don't know...&quot; he started. 
<br>

<br>
 Paul rolled his eyes, getting frustrated again. &quot;What else can you do?&quot; he protested. &quot;If we wait much longer, one of my kids will come home. Do you think they'll
<br>
 be any more understanding? I doubt it!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Matt didn't like the way Mr. DeSoto was getting upset again, but he was running out of options. He would just have to take the risk. Instead of replying, he
<br>
 climbed off Mr. DeSoto's body and went over to the wand. &quot;I wish Mr. DeSoto was out from under Steve, and restored to his original size, immediately.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 As soon as Matt had pronounced the last syllable, the room exploded into motion. Mr. DeSoto vanished out from under Steve, and Steve started to fall over, still
<br>
 frozen. Matt saw Mr. DeSoto coming back into focus in the middle of the room, at the correct size. Matt turned to see Steve's enormous body crashing down on
<br>
 him, swelling quickly as Matt's most recent wish sliced his remaining size in half. 
<br>

<br>
 Matt tried to run, but at three inches he couldn't cover much ground. He was bounced into the air as Steve rolled and Matt fell back to the covers, the wind
<br>
 knocked out of him. As Matt struggled to get up, a huge tarp of flesh rolled over his legs. Now, HE was pinned, and beneath one of Steve's balls... as big as a
<br>
 small car. Matt realized he wasn't going anywhere. 
<br>

<br>
 It took a moment for Paul to gather his bearings, but then everything seemed to be in order. His bedroom looked right, and he noticed that Steve had fallen over.
<br>
 He walked over to the bed and knelt down to find the wand. As his hand closed around it, he saw what was left of Matt... less than three inches of him. Half of that
<br>
 was trapped underneath Steve. 
<br>

<br>
 Paul chuckled at the scene. &quot;Seems like a good place for you,&quot; he said to Matt.</p>
