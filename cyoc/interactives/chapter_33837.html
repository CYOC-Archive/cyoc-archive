<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A little later back at home Dylan was getting ready for the sleepover. He heard the doorbell ring and Karren answer it. He heard two familiar voices greet Karen, Anna and Rachael were here. He lugged his pillow and new sleeping bag downstairs.<br />
<br />
When Dylan entered the living room Lisa said &quot;There you are Catherine. Now that you're here we can begin the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven't told us what game we're playing&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a variant of spin the bottle&quot; Lisa said. &quot;In this one you spin the bottle and you can transform the person it points to into anything you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun but Catherine won't be able to play&quot; Karen said. &quot;I broke the medallion and according to what I read no magic can transform her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That only applies to permanent transformations&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The transformations we'll be doing are temporary, lasting only an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I can be transformed?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can become a boy again&quot; Dylan said with a surprised look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only for an hour&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang again and Karen went to answer it. She came back with Jenny and pizza.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now the whole White Witch Club is here&quot; Jenny said. &quot;When Karen called me and invited me to a sleepover I knew I had to come. It's been awhile since we had a sleepover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you brought pizza&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a sleepover without pizza?&quot; Jenny asked rhetorically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad you could come&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you babysitting Karen?&quot; Jenny asked when she saw Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Karen said. &quot;This is Catherine. She used to be Dylan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Jenny said. &quot;How did he change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I used a medallion on him that Lisa had left for him&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always thought that Lisa was kidding about magic being real&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're going to see plenty of magic&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Now as I was saying, this is the magical version of spin the bottle. We'll be using a pointer as the bottle.&quot; She placed a wooden arrow on the the floor. &quot;After I activate it it will spin and point to one of us. It will then be that persons turn to spin it. All you have to do in order to spin it is to say spin. When it stops you get to pick that<br />
person's transformation. The transformations can be animal, age regression, age progression, body modification, inanimate, size, transgender, and mythical. You can only choose one of the transformations at a time. Now, do you want to play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; everyone said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Lisa said, &quot;now take off all clothes and jewelry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Anna asked. &quot;Don't you have spells that will transform our clothes along with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could do that but it's much more fun to watch all the changes&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my ears?&quot; Dylan asked. &quot;They said not to take my earrings out until my ears have healed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Catherine&quot; Lisa said, &quot;I forgot about that. I'm going to teach you a spell that will heal them almost instantly.&quot; Lisa whispered into Dylan's ear. &quot;Do you have that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then give it a try&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Dylan began turning the studs in his ears and muttering some words. When he finished he said &quot;My ears aren't sore anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You did it right and now you can take your earrings out. Now let's get undressed girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa began to undress and everyone else followed her lead. Dylan felt a little self conscious about being naked in front of everyone. He kept his eyes down and covered his pussy with his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to be embarrassed Catherine&quot; Lisa said. &quot;After all, we're all girls here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a boy though&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have anything we haven't seen before&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
Dylan slowly moved his hands to his side and lifted his head. He could feel the heat in his cheeks as he blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get used to being naked in front of us Catherine&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You know, now that Catherine is a girl we could make her a part of the White Witch Club. What does everyone think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's a great idea&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm all for it&quot; Rachael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be nice to have a new member&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Karen. She was taking her time and thinking it over. Finally she said &quot;I guess she could join the club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it's settled&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Welcome to our little club Catherine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you call yourselves the White Witch Club?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a nickname that people started using for us&quot; Lisa said. &quot;They knew that my mother claimed to be a witch and assumed that I would claim it too. Of course they began to refer to my friends as witches too and we all happen to be white. We just adopted it as our official name after awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you want to be my friend after all I did to you?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have learned your lesson&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Besides, you're like us. You didn't have any friends throughout your life and neither did any of us. That is until I made friends with your sister. From there our friends grew. Now we have eight friends in our little club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael is my friend&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael is no one's friend&quot; Lisa said. &quot;He just goes through the motions to get something he wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He never asked me for anything&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because he wants your sister&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be true&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to say that it is&quot; Jenny said. &quot;My brother overheard him bragging about how much of a fool you were to his father. He also bragged that he was about to nail Karen and his father congratulated him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ewww... I would not have sex with him even if he was the last man on Earth&quot; Karen said. &quot;He crept me out whenever he was here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was just pretending to be my friend to get to Karen?&quot; Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid so&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven't you heard the rumors about him?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course I have&quot; Dylan said. &quot;Michael assured me that those were just rumors. He said that they were started by girls who wanted to date him but that he turned down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you believe him?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wanted to believe him&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you though?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really I guess&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was your intuition telling you that he was lying to you&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Listen to it and it won't steer you wrong. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now let's sit down and get started&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Catherine, you sit by me so you can read the spell book. I have one request to make. When you pick the transformations for Catherine and me, please make sure that at least one of us can speak at all times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Jenny asked sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's so we can keep the game going&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Catherine has an innate ability to use this type of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't all magic the same?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; Lisa said. &quot;The type of magic that Catherine and I can do is nearly instantaneous. The type that my mom does isn't. You all can do that type of magic if you want to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would we be able to transform people?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you wouldn't&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You could create the illusion of someone changing but not really, physically change them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does Catherine get to do that?&quot; Karen asked. &quot;She's my sister so I should be able to too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why certain people can use this type of magic&quot; Lisa said. &quot;All I know is that family has nothing to do with it. As far as I know, I'm the only one in my family that can use this instant magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't fair&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life is rarely fair&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Now, if you're ready we'll begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa muttered a spell and the pointer started to spin. It came to rest pointing at Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you're first Karen&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Karen reached out to the pointer and tried to give it a spin but it didn't move. &quot;Why can't I spin it?&quot; she asked. When she had said spin the pointer had started spinning and it came to rest on Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot that you needed to say spin&quot; Lisa said &quot;and you get to pick Catherine's transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen thought about it for a few seconds and then said &quot;I know the perfect transformation for her. Turn her into a mermaid Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A mermaid huh&quot; Lisa said flipping through the book. &quot;Ah here it is. Ready for your transformation Catherine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but go ahead&quot; Dylan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Lisa said then muttered the spell.<br />
<br />
When Lisa was done Dylan felt his body start to tingle from the waist down. He stretched out his legs to see if the tingling would go away. It didn't and when he looked down he could see a thin strip of his skin was green. As he watched that thin strip of green began working it's way down. As it did he noticed that the green had a scale pattern to it. The green skin kept on moving down his body. When it reached his legs they started to fuse together. Dylan stared wide eyed<br />
at what was happening. He knew that he still had his pussy, it just moved forward to the front of what was quickly becoming his tail. He felt the bones in his legs fuse together and change into vertebrae. When the transformation reached his ankles it forced his feet down and then out. His feet flattened out to become fins. The transformation was now complete and it had only took about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was interesting to watch&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is weird&quot; Dylan said flexing his tail up and down. He suddenly felt like he needed to go to the bathroom. &quot;Oh no, I need to pee and something else I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take you to the bathroom&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Try and hold it Catherine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how long I can hold it&quot; Dylan said as Lisa picked him up and carried him to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom Lisa placed him on the toilet laying down. She kept her arms under his chest and tail to help him balance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you can go now&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Dylan couldn't hold it any longer anyways and started peeing. It was different than peeing as either a boy or a girl. After his bladder emptied he started to push his feces out. That was definitely different. Instead of coming out the back it came out the front just below his pussy. When he was finished with that Lisa lifted him off the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to wipe you now&quot; Lisa said as she tore off some toilet paper and ran it under the sink faucet. She then wiped his slit.<br />
<br />
On the way back Dylan said &quot;That was weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's how a mermaid eliminates waste&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It closely resembles a fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa put Dylan on his front and then sat back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens now?&quot; Rachael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Catherine gets to spin&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Dylan said, &quot;spin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pointer started spinning again and when it stopped it was pointing to...</p>
