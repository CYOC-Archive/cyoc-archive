<br />
“Tell me about it” Jon said.  It was surreal, he was looking at the  small right foot, and wiggling his toes he could feel them move in the  boot.  He wiggled his left foot and the small left foot moved to his  command.  <br />
<br />
Dr. Jackson put a firm hand on his shoulder and tried to be reassuring.   “We’ll find a way out of this mess, the sick bastard switched bodies  around between all six members.  Fortunately, preliminary tests are all  positive and so far there are no other physical abnormalities but until  we do complete physicals we can’t give you a clean bill of health and  certainly until psychological tests are complete I cannot release any of  you back to duty.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A woman’s scream shattered the room.  Jon looked to his left and two  beds down agent Jill Skaggs was pounding her legs with her fists.   “Nooo!” she yelled and began crying.  <br />
<br />
“Poor Kid” Dr. Jackson said  “She’s engaged to be married next Saturday.”  <br />
<br />
Jon stopped to think a moment and glanced back down to his lap.  The  fatigues were form fitting and judging by what he was seeing he now had  quite some form.  He chuckled as he thought about his ex wife and how  she would be loving this right now.  She would really be enjoying this  and he hoped she would never find out.  <br />
<br />
He placed his hand flat against the zipper and found himself shocked at  the realization that not only did he now had Joy Peal’s legs and feet  but essentially also everything from the belt line down, including her  hips, butt and genitals.   He could feel his hand against “his” abdomen  and he slid his hand up and under his tee shirt.  The skin about two  inches above the belt was very soft and smooth, it was also very  sensitive to his rough callused palm but a distinct line was felt where  the smooth skin gave way to his normal mildly hairy stomach which felt  rather coarse in direct contrast with Joy’s smooth and soft skin. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
“Protocol says you need to put this on” Dr Jackson said as he handed him  a necklace with an iridescent pendant on it.  Jon recognized it as the  Inca protection jewel that the victims of Von Crucial must wear in order  to remain hidden from his telepathic link.  He grabbed it and put it on  over his head.  <br />
<br />
“So does Joy have…mine?” he asked  <br />
<br />
“Afraid so”   <br />
<br />
“So what now?   Have we contacted HQ?”  “Benson has been contacted, he’s requesting support from a team from  A.G.E.N.T .  Their experience with the paranormal is unmatched.  <br />
<br />
“Well check me out doc.  I’m not going to sit on the sidelines for this.  I can still operate…”  <br />
<br />
“Slow down Jon, you’ve just been through a major transformation and  lived to tell us about it.   Let’s not put the cart before the horse on  this and first thing tomorrow we’ll start a battery of physical and  mental tests.  NSOPS needs bodies, yes, but we cannot afford a  detriment…you understand that.  We’re moving you and your team onto  campus, someone has already on the way with extra uniforms and other  necessities.  <br />
<br />
“I’ve got all of that in my locker, my field bag is packed with 7 days worth of supplies and equipment.”  <br />
<br />
“Jon, look at yourself.”  Dr. Jackson said pointing to his legs.  “Do  you really think your uniforms and boots will fit you now?”  <br />
<br />
Jon paused, and considered the obvious fact that nothing he owned, save for his shirts would fit him now.  <br />
<br />
 “I have work to do”  John said softly and started to stand up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed.  <br />
<br />
“Easy does it Jon, here let me help you.  Nurse, bring that wheelchair over here please.”  <br />
<br />
Bracing against Dr Jackson’s shoulder, Jon slid down off of the gurney.   It took longer than expected for his feet to touch the tile of the  floor, but they eventually made contact and his knees buckled slightly.   His back ached a little and his stomach felt like it had a Charlie  horse but he stood up straight and looked up at Dr. Jackson…and looked  down…and looked up again.  He felt like he was standing in a hole, or  the Dr. was standing on a step or something because being 6’1 and the  Dr. also being close to his height they always looked eye to eye.  Now,  however, he was looking up to make eye contact with his long time  friend.  Looking down, again he remembered he wasn’t the same as before  and the switch with Joy has left him short about 3 inches.  He looked at  he small black boots, marveling at how small they were and rocking  slightly back and forth he noticed too that it was harder to balance on  them and he staggered slightly.  Sticking his arms out he regained his  balance and looking back up to Dr. Jackson he smiled and said “See, just  like riding a bike”  <br />
<br />
“Sit” Dr. Jackson said motioning to the wheel chair.  “Nurse Gable will  take you to your room.  I’ll send a wake up call for you at 0600, get  some rest and for God sake, don’t take that pendant off.”  <br />
<br />
He sat down slowly and marveled at how his butt seemed to take up much  more of the seat than it used to and Nurse Gable pushed him out of the  triage area and down the hall.  “Here we are” she said and stopped outside the doorway of room 108.   Stepping around the front of the chair, she extended her arm.  Jon  grabbed her arm with one hand and with the other pushed off on the arm  rest and stood up shakily.  She opened the door and walked him in  slowly.  <br />
<br />
The mechanics were the same.  Walking no matter who you are is simply  one foot in front of the other.  Doing so day after day for 35 some odd  years becomes second nature but to suddenly have the equipment replaced  does cause some issues.  Nurse Gable said the brain remembers, but the  signals from the brain to the new muscles, tendons and nerve groups have  been re-routed.  The brain remembers yes, but the muscle memory and the  brain need to be in sync otherwise the movements are less fluid and it  is going to take some time before full coordination can be  reestablished, if ever.  <br />
<br />
I was walking, yes but it was slow and my new feet tingled as if there  were waking up from being asleep.  On the kitchen counter was a standard  issue duffel bag.  <br />
<br />
“You can find uniforms and supplied in there.  Here is my pager number,  please call if you need any help.  I’ll be on duty until 0800.” She said  and smiled.  I didn’t realize it but she was also making herself  available for any “Female” questions I may have.  <br />
<br />
“I mean, you know…if you have any questions about stuff…” and she glanced down at my lower half.  <br />
<br />
Jon felt himself blush, “ yeah sure, umm I’ll be sure to call”  trying  to sound confident but was again suddenly hit with the reality of it all  because in honesty what would he know about such things.   <br />
<br />
“If you like, I can speak with Joy and see if there is anything special you need to know about.”  <br />
<br />
“Special?”  <br />
<br />
“Yes. Like STD’s, PMS, or even pregnancy.  You have inherited a whole new way of life Detective.”  <br />
<br />
Jon doubted that STD’s would be a problem.  Peal seemed like a good kid  but the thought of the other things made him wonder what exactly are the  cards he’s been dealt.  <br />
<br />
Jon yawned  <br />
<br />
“Get some rest, the Dr. prescribed a mild sedative.  The bedroom is the  second door on the left.” She said as she turned to walk out the door.  <br />
<br />
The door closed and Jon was left to his own thoughts. The sedative was  starting to kick in so he decided to make way to the bedroom.  <br />
<br />
Standing by the bed, he noticed how the bed seemed higher, probably a  result of his lost 3 inches.  Turning to sit down, the bed didn’t hit  him right at the knees anymore and he found he had to hop slightly to  get his butt up on the mattress.  Joy’s shorter legs were going to take  some time to get used to and sitting on the bed with his feet not  touching the floor was another reminder.  <br />
<br />
Pivoting on this butt, he swung his legs up and started to lie down.  He  winced as it felt like a pubic hair was caught and pulled in the  elastic of his underwear somewhere “down there”.  Up until now he was  blocking from though about the strange sensations he was getting from  the lower regions of his new body parts.  The sharp sting of a hair  being pulled however was not something he could just block out.    <br />
<br />
“I better take these off” he said and sat up to remove the boots from  his feet.  He untied the laces and slid the small boot off.  He was  somewhat relieved that he now only had standard issue white socks where  he was half expecting pink.  <br />
<br />
The foot seemed impossibly small, and taking a breath he reached down  and slid the sock off.  The small bare foot was tipped with red nail  polish. He wiggled the tiny toes and stared shocked at what he was  seeing.  <br />
<br />
He removed the boot and sock from his left foot and lay back on the pillow.  Reaching over to grab the phone, he dialed HQ.  <br />
<br />
“Benson here” a voice answered  <br />
<br />
“Tom, its Jon”  <br />
<br />
“Jon….I heard.  How are you?”  <br />
<br />
“I feel fine, in fact that’s why I’m calling.  I can’t sit on the sideline for this…you know that.”  <br />
<br />
“Yes,  I know but we’re over our head.”  <br />
<br />
“When is the AGENT team arriving?”  <br />
<br />
“I have a meeting at 0900 tomorrow, if Dr. Jackson will sign off, I’ll reinstate you to this case but it’s up to the Dr.”  <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Tom, I’ll be there.”  <br />
<br />
“Get some rest Jon, that’s an order.  We’ll talk more tomorrow.”  Tom Benson said and hung up.</p>
