<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky brought you over to a small outbuilding at the back of the main farmhouse. You cautiously stepped inside and were instantly hit with the strong scent of dog; multiple dogs in fact, as you entered what was apparently some sort of kennel. The building was small, with only a few of the doorless cells actually looking like they were occupied. None of the dogs were currently in, which made you question whether you had seen any wandering around the yard earlier. Everything was all such a blur that the details were hard to recall.<br />
<br />
However, things took a much more alarming turn when you were escorted into a small room at the back of the building. There, lying tied up on the floor, was the struggling form of your best friend Josh!<br />
<br />
You whinnied out in shock as you saw your college friend trying to wriggle free from the ropes wrapped around him. He was clearly both angry and terrified as he struggled to talk with a gag in his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Awww still struggling dear?” Vicky said as she crouched down to stroke Josh’s bound body, “I thought you would be happy to finally find your missing friend.” Josh clearly didn’t grasp what Vicky meant as she motioned to you. “Well it seems that spreading all of those malicious rumours about us and kicking up a fuss online has paid off. And now that the two of you have been reunited you will be staying together for a very, very long time.”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky nodded to her father who gave a loud whistle that echoed through the building and the surrounding yard. Not long after this two dogs, a border collie and a labrador, came bounding into the room. The two distinctly male dogs were obviously excited as they sat panting and looking up at their masters expectantly.<br />
<br />
“Go on boys,” Vicky’s mother Helen said with a nod, “you deserve a reward for your good behaviour.”<br />
<br />
The two dogs needed no further encouragement as they sprang up and went over to Josh as he continued to writhe around helplessly. Strangely, the two dogs seemed to act like they had been in this kind of situation before as both quickly approached and started to investigate him.<br />
<br />
After giving knowing looks to each other, the two highly-intelligent canines got to work. The labrador began methodically biting and tearing at Josh’s clothes, whereas the border collie started to lick the exposed flesh on his arms and legs. Seeing this made you shift around nervously; these two animals must have been formerly human in order to be this intelligent. And more worryingly, if Josh was to be a ‘reward’ for these two male dogs, then you had a pretty good idea of what would soon happen to him.<br />
<br />
These dreadful suspicions were confirmed when you saw patches of black and white hair starting to sprout over the areas of skin where the border collie had licked. You also noticed that Josh’s muscular arms had started to dwindle somewhat, whilst his hands looked stiffer and rougher than before. He had clearly noticed these changes as well as he fought with renewed effort and looked around the room wildly.<br />
<br />
You continued to watch the sick process until you were distracted by the arrival of another dog, though this one was undeniably female. It was a labrador bitch, and a heavily pregnant one at that. She looked like she was ready to give birth this minute as two rows of milk-filled teats sagged down from her swollen belly. However you also noticed that, unlike the other dogs, she seemed to be extremely reluctant to be there. You were just starting to ask yourself why this was the case, when Vicky answered this question for you.<br />
<br />
“Ah there you are,” she said with her usual sinister smile, “I was wondering where you had got to.” The labrador bitch just looked back at her without making a noise. “Awww don’t look at me like that dear, maybe if you hadn’t been such a shitty boyfriend then you wouldn’t be in your current situation.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you feel sick inside as you studied the pained expression on the female labrador’s face. You could only imagine what kind of hell this poor guy was going through. As you thought about this harder though you paused; you were in exactly the same situation as her, just in a different body.<br />
<br />
You continued to watch the female labrador until a loud tearing sound signalled the destruction of Josh’s shirt. You turned to look at him and were stunned to see that he was now looking much more dog-like than he had a minute ago. Already his body had slimmed and shrunk to more canine proportions as more black and white hairs poked through the patches of ripped clothing. In fact most of the ropes had fallen away, allowing Josh to rise onto his hands and knees. However, the two lively dogs and the painful anatomical changes wracking his body worked together to ensure that he couldn’t rise to two feet and instead remained on the ground like an animal.<br />
<br />
You continue to watch in morbid fascination as your friend shifted further. You stared in horror as the border collie licked down the length of Josh’s spine, causing a line of white hairs to follow in his tongue’s wake as his body continued to transform painfully. Then the dog focused on the base of Josh’s spine for a good thirty seconds, after which the distinct nub of a tail started to press out and become covered in more of the same black and white hairs that now covered most of his body.<br />
<br />
You grimaced and looked away from this horrifying process as you instead turned back to the female labrador. Vicky had rolled the dog onto her back and was now kneeling down beside her. “Such an adorable bitch,” you heard her say as she ran her hands over the two rows of swollen teats on the dog’s underside, occasionally pinching one of the nipples as she went.” The female labrador was clearly opposed to this as she whined and shifted around in discomfort. “Awww don’t you like it when I play with your boobs,” Vicky said as she started to rub and pinch the teats much more forcefully, “I seem to remember you saying that playing with mine was the only part of our relationship that you would miss. How ironic...”  <br />
<br />
Vicky’s ex could only whine pathetically as she squirmed under her cruel ministrations. In the meantime, Vicky’s father David was busy tidying up the various ropes and scraps of clothing that lay scattered around Josh’s misshapen body. As for Helen, she was doing her best to comfort you as she sensed the anxiety and disgust that this whole scenario was causing you.<br />
<br />
These feelings soon reached the next level when David forcibly removed Josh’s torn underwear, leaving him naked save for the warm hairy coat that now covered most of his body beneath the head. You were then treated to a view of your best mate’s bare ass with his limp penis hanging beneath him.<br />
<br />
However, things then took a weird turn when the border collie pressed forward and started to lick your friend’s dick over and over. You heard Josh give a muffled cry of protest as an expression of pure shame and humiliation spread across his face.<br />
<br />
In spite of this reaction though, the border collie didn’t stop. As a result of this, and to the surprise of both you and Josh, the penis started to clearly harden in response to the attention. Before long, Josh sported a full hard-on as he struggled to comprehend this strange enjoyment that his body was experiencing.<br />
<br />
However, things only got more gross when Josh came suddenly onto the floor below. As disgusting as this was, you found that you couldn’t look away as you witnessed what must have been the longest ejaculation in history. However, as more of Josh’s semen flowed out of him you soon spotted that his testicles appeared to be steadily deflating. You looked harder and, sure enough, the two balls were starting to shrivel up as they seemed to simply dump their contents onto the floor below.<br />
<br />
This odd process continued until the stream of cum finally started to subside. However, things only got worse as the dog’s frantic lapping now caused your friend’s junk to dwindle and shift closer to his tail. Although you guessed what was coming, you were unable to avert your gaze as the skin of your friend’s scrotum morphed into a pronounced mound between his legs. This then adopted a typical canine spade shape as a tight slit opened up down the centre of the developing folds. After this, you watched in awe as the remnants of Josh’s penis withdrew between his newly-formed pussy lips, leaving him with a sensitive clitoris nestled snugly inside his new doggy cunt. Not only was he losing his humanity, but like you Josh was having his masculinity erased as well.<br />
<br />
You heard Josh whine out in dismay as you stared at the canine sex that now adorned his rear-end. You felt sick as you watched the dark spade swelling with blood as Josh’s first bitch’s heat settled over him. Before long you were able to see moisture glistening off the swollen mound as the Zoo’s curse truly started to take hold.<br />
<br />
You continued to stare at your friend’s new genitalia until a sharp bark from nearby made you turn back to the unfortunate female labrador. Now Vicky had moved one hand away from her ex’s teats so that she could focus her efforts on her canine vagina. Now she currently had two fingers wriggling around inside the dog’s pussy as she continued to grope her swollen chest.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Hon,” Vicky said as she teased the helpless labrador, “soon you will be able to share the title of resident breeding bitch. Having said that though, don’t think that you’ll be let off the hook after this litter. Once this lot of puppies is safely delivered I want another batch inside you within a fortnight. Though I’m sure this won’t be a problem. I’ve seen you sneaking off for a cheeky fuck several times already. Deep down I think you love being a horny bitch; you’re just afraid to show it.” The stunned dog clearly tried to answer but was cut short when Vicky started to rapidly thrust her fingers in and out of her. Soon the dog was left moaning and writhing around on her back as she started to completely give in to the pleasure coursing through her body.<br />
<br />
As Vicky and her ex started to get into it, you turned back to Josh just as his final features were taking shape. You noticed that he now looked almost identical to the male border collie, save for the new vagina and rows of teats that poked out from his hairy body. All that was left was Josh’s face, which looked like it would soon be changing like the rest of him.<br />
<br />
The male border collie was now eagerly lapping over Josh’s face as he tried to pull away from the persistent dog. Sadly, this made little difference as Josh’s face started to stretch out into a canine muzzle. The gag in his mouth finally snapped, but when he tried to speak all that came out were angry barks. This clearly horrified Josh, meaning that he could only whine and shake his head as the last of his human body faded away. Soon, standing in place of your friend was a terrified border collie bitch.<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” David said as he studied your stunned friend carefully, “you should come and have a look at her Vic, she’s quite a magnificent animal.” Vicky huffed in mild annoyance after not quite finishing with her ex. However, she did as her father said and walked over to where Josh was trembling in shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm... I suppose this is… Jasmine now?” Vicky smiled as her parents both seemed to agree with her. “Alright, let’s see what our new bitch has got.” With that, Vicky and her father spent the next few minutes poking and prodding your friend as they inspected his, or rather ‘her,’ new body.<br />
<br />
Seeing all of this desperately made you want to fight back. But you didn’t want to make things worse for you or ‘Jasmine.’ As a result you simply watched and waited until the examination was over.<br />
<br />
Now that she was seemingly happy with her new pet, Vicky moved over to you and looked deep into your eyes. “Now then dear, we shall see whether Jasmine deserves to stay here with us as our newest breeding bitch. If not, well let’s just say that there are far worse fates out there for the both of you. If I were you Princess, I would behave yourself and not give Jasmine here any ideas. After all, you don’t want to be separated after she tried so hard to find you. That would be simply awful…”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, Jasmine looked at you with wide eyes, clearly asking whether you were really her best mate. You could only look back and neigh sadly, which made Jasmine whine in despair as she buried her head in her paws.<br />
<br />
“Awww don’t be so sad,” Vicky said as she walked over to Jasmine and started to stroke the back of her neck, “you’ll make a fine bitch and a wonderful pet to boot. Before that though we need to get you locked into this beautiful body of yours. For that to happen though, I’m afraid we’re going to have to put that new pussy of yours to work…”<br />
<br />
You and Jasmine shared a worried look before a sudden bark caused you both to turn your heads. There, standing behind your friend, was the male border collie; who was now staring intensely at her new canine vagina. Not long after this you saw a flash of red between the dog’s legs as his bright red canine cock got ready for action.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky said with a smile, “let’s see what Jasmine here is made of…”</p>
