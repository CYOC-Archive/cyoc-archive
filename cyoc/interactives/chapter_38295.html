<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That kid...&quot; Ty said while walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Kent asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter.&quot; Ty said looking at the sky wanting to see his cousin. But the young superhero was not there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid!? Have you looked at yourself? You are younger than him!&quot; Kent said to the little boy. It was true. Ty totally forgot that some hours ago he regressed back to a five years old. But he was very worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's still too young for his newly acquired superpowers. I wouldn't care if changes were temporary. But Prince made him a superhero forever, and now he's the only superhero in this world. He is alone. He needs a partner, someone must teach him how to use his superpowers.&quot; Ty said and his body started to get bigger until he was a teenager again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Kent.&quot; Ty smiled to his friend and gave him a hug. &quot;But I can't leave my cousin alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... What are you going to do!?&quot; Kent was getting worried.<br />
<br />
But Ty seemed to ignore him. He was calling Prince with his telekinetik powers. And before he could think anything, Prince was already there in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you going to call me, Tyler?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Ty explained everything to his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm... I see... I understand you.&quot; Prince said. &quot;I can turn you into another superhero, but your transformation will be permanent too. So please think about it, it's a very important decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm ready, master.&quot; a nervous Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... And I must warn you about one more thing.&quot; Prince continued. &quot;If you really want to become a superhero partner for Peter, some changes on your ages will be necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of changes?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter will regress back to a ten years old. And you will turn into an adult. The little superhero needs a good teacher, and I know you can do a good job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty was unsure. If the transformation was permanent he was going to spend the rest of his life as an adult superhero. That meant: no more transformations, no more fun at school, no more human life. On the other hand, he knew that someone had to urgently take care of his cousin Peter. And why not... He loved the idea of being Superman and wearing his tight but comfortable costume. Finally, he decided to accept.<br />
<br />
Prince smiled and the transformation started. Ty expected to enjoy a slow transformation, but Prince was so powerful that his transformation was instantaneous. Ty opened his eyes when he already felt different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready.&quot; Prince said.<br />
<br />
Ty looked at his new body. He was as huge as Peter was when they turned him into Superman. He had the same greek god body, with the same superpowers. Ty felt good, his huge stone muscles tried to rip his costume, but that fabric was indestructible. He knew he was safe wearing those tights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing...&quot; Ty said with a new adult voice. &quot;Simply amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty continued looking at himself rubbing his muscles and touching lightly every part of that muscular body that now was his.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can still change Peter's age, right?&quot; Prince said to Kent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; the boy answered.<br />
<br />
Prince smiled. &quot;You can do your part now.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok!&quot; Kent said. He concentrated on Peter again and tried to make him younger.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the sky, the new Superboy felt a tickle in every part of his body and he started to regress. Peter stopped flying and wondered what was going on. He knew that Ty or Kent were changing him, but why? He was very far from them, but thanks to his supervision he easily spotted them. Kent was there, but Ty wasn't. Instead of his cousin, he saw Prince and a muscular man wearing a costume like the one he was wearing! He flied over there at superspeed, and in less than 30 seconds his feet were already touching the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter!&quot; Kent said when he saw Superboy appearing in front of them.<br />
<br />
The young superhero asked Prince why he changed. And then Kent explained him everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; Peter said almost shedding a tear. &quot;You did this for me. Thank you, cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget about calling me cousin, Peter. From now on we are superheroes: you are the young and mighty Superboy, and I'm Superman, your father.&quot; Ty said. Peter felt weird when Ty called himself his father, but sounded cool after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are still a little boy, and you don't know how to use all your powers. Don't worry about that, now I'll be with you forever, son. I'll teach you everything I know, and in the future you will become the new Superman.&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, dad!&quot; Peter grinned. He called dad to his cousin for the first time, but felt like if Ty was his father since he was born. The little Peter was very happy to know that he wasn't going to be alone on his new life. Then, he approached to Kent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah Kent! You are taller now!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not! You are the one who became smaller!&quot; Kent said and everyone laughed. Peter was now shorter than Kent, but he was still wider, he was the boy with the biggest muscles in the world.<br />
<br />
Now that Kent and Peter were chatting and laughing, Ty seized the opportunity to continue exploring his new body. He still could not believe that that superhuman was himself. His rock-solid pectorals, his bowling ball sized biceps, his superpowers, his adult mind, his tight costume... Everything was real. Even his new son, Superboy. He liked the idea of being a father for that little muscle boy. He looked at him and smiled. Peter was doing some poses and flexing his huge child super biceps, Kent laughed and touched his steel muscles. Superboy loved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care of the kid, Tyler.&quot; Prince said. Ty smiled to his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Superboy, time to go. We should start our patrol.&quot; finally Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right, daddy.&quot; Peter said and stopped playing with Kent. &quot;Sorry Kent, I have to go. I'm not a human anymore. I'm Superboy, and I must do my job. We will meet again someday, I know it. Thanks for all.&quot; he said and hugged his friend.<br />
<br />
Finally, Superboy walked to his father. But when both superheroes were going to jump high and fly...<br />
&quot;Wait!!&quot; the voice of Kent sounded. Superman and Superboy looked again to the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's up, champ?&quot; Ty said.</p>
