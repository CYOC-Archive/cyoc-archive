<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Out of all of Mr. Yuan&#39;s various transformatives, he had succeeded in using one of his most nefarious ones to eliminate the young man who had been a thorn in his side. He thought of it as a &quot;de-humanizing&quot; ointment. It would essentially reduce and/or remove any physically human traits from the user. There were few benign applications for this when it came to human use. However, Mr. Yuan had seen it used a few times before with frightening results. Essentially, this would reduce a normal person to a hairless, virtually featureless biped vaguely resembling a living stick figure or &quot;gray&quot; alien. Soon, his granddaughter&#39;s good-for-nothing boyfriend would be warped into a miserable wretch and be out of the picture for good. Interestingly, Raijin was no longer exactly a &quot;normal human&quot; due to his exposure days ago to various products in Yuan&#39;s shop. The old man didn&#39;t consider this, nor would it have mattered to him. He slept soundly comforted by the fact that the deed was done.<br />
<br />
Raijin, on the other hand, suddenly bolted awake from a dead sleep in excruciating pain. Every bone and muscle in his body was either aching or burning. He felt his skin stretch in places. His ears were filled with the subtle, sickening sounds of joints popping and tendons slipping in and out of place. This felt entirely unlike his previous transformations. Panic began to swell within him. Through the pain, he worked up the determination to find out what was happening to his body. He managed to throw off his covers with unexpected difficulty, and though his limbs didn&#39;t seem to work as expected, he managed to stagger through his dark apartment to the kitchen. With a final force of will, he was able to reach for the light switch, but his legs gave out causing him to fall to the floor and take the full length mirror by the front door off the wall with him. It ended up on the floor opposite Raijin, and he could only lay there and watch as his body continued to contort and reshape itself.<br />
<br />
In his state of shock, he barely registered the grimacing, demi-human face of his reflection as his own. Instead, he focused first on his arms. It seemed his shoulder blades were enlarging and gradually rearranging themselves forward on his torso limiting his arms more to forward movement. His forearms grew longer before him as the bones within them and in his hands became thicker and sturdier. His fingers snapped and reshaped into dexterous paws. The skin of his palms thickened into pads, and his nails rapidly grew and twisted into sharp claws.<br />
<br />
Raijin growled in pain as he bent his lengthening neck to observe similar changes in his legs. His feet had, by now, deformed into broad, digitigrade paws. Unlike his hands, the nails on his feet had grown broad and thick, resembling individual hooves on each of the four prominent toes.<br />
<br />
The changes to his limbs along with the simultaneous deepening and narrowing of his chest pointed to his form becoming quadrupedal. Raijin has little time to consider this as searing pains signaled that his spine was starting to elongate. His neck was forced to straighten as it grew longer. He began to feel an entirely new sensation at the base of his spine. It progressed rapidly into a tingling burn as new sensory nerves came to life in what he reasoned must be a tail. He began to see it reach further and further across the floor as it grew rapidly.<br />
<br />
Raijin realized the anguished sounds coming from his mouth sounded less vocal and more bestial. This prompted him to inspect what was becoming his new face. The gold eyes and striped hair were all that seemed to remain of what he was used to seeing in the mirror. A broad muzzle was growing forward complete with a cleft in his upper lip. His nose had grown into wide, pink snout. It was a bit more bulbous and square and had more prominent nostrils than a typical feline nose. He then noticed two huge lumps bulging out at the corners of his forehead. They gradually grew darker, and the skin atop them slowly fell away to reveal a pair of dark brown horns pushing slowly forward. The pain in his head increased now, and his jaw began to ache. He soon found himself spitting out mouthfuls of his shed teeth not unlike a few days prior. The new ones grew in rapidly this time. He felt them with his now huge, rough-skinned tongue. He now possessed a strange variety of teeth: wide, sturdy molars; wickedly sharp fangs; and strong, chisel-like incisors. He next felt a frantic twitching of his ears. They had shifted slightly upward on his head beneath his burgeoning horns. As he tested his ability to move them, he saw thick hair begin to sprout on them.<br />
<br />
The rest of Raijin&#39;s new body followed suit. As the changes to his body structure were levelling off, he could feel a furry pelt growing all over him. The dominant color was a deep golden brown. Dull brown-black stripes spread across his back and densely adorned his limbs and long tail. The tiger-patterned hair he had come to enjoy grew out into a short but dense mane that began on the top of his head and tapered along the crest of his neck to his shoulders. His tail grew a bushy black tuft at its end as well.<br />
<br />
The beast lay exhausted on the kitchen floor. The changes, seemingly done, had left his joints and muscles utterly depleted, and he could do nothing more than gasp for breath as the shock of the transformation wore off.<br />
<br />
Raijin wondered if dying from exhaustion on the floor after transforming into some unknown beast was to be his fate. It seemed his luck had not yet run out, however. Mr. Yuan&#39;s potent enhancers would bestow mercy on the young soul. Slowly, Raijin began to feel a warmth in his bestial testes. He could feel them begin to pulse as they swelled larger sending hormones rushing through his new body. His pain and weakness faded away, and a building heat gradually replaced them. He soon had strength enough to carefully rise to his feet for the first time. The heat kept coming in waves as his muscles began to fill out. Heaps of muscle piled up on his shoulders and haunches. His limbs grew steadily more powerful. With a final big wave of euphoric fire, he felt his sheathed beast cock swell tremendously, and Raijin felt such power that couldn&#39;t help but belt out a deafening roar.<br />
<br />
As he lowered his head, he gazed into the mirror to admire his new majestic form. At first glance, he resembled a huge tiger, standing well over 4 feet tall at the shoulders and easily carrying at least half a ton of fierce muscle. The powerful definition in his limbs visibly bulged through his thick hide and coat. His tail seemed unusually long at around 5 feet itself. He found he had a great amount of control over it as though it were almost prehensile. The greatest difference was his head. Although it was vaguely feline, the fleshy, square nose and forward-facing horns gave impressions of a bull. As did his unique hoof-nailed rear paws. He imagined they would provide exceptional traction. His front paws had actually kept all five digits. His thumbs had maintained a low level of mobility, and he felt he could probably still grasp things with them. He thought back to his first exposure at the store. He guessed his new beast body blended some traits from all of them: tiger, bull, horse, and... rat? That must have been where the tail and &quot;thumbs&quot; came from. He also became aware of his enhanced predatory senses. He could see clearly into the other darkened rooms and hear and smell things that must have been in other apartments.<br />
<br />
Admiring the fearsome beast he had become, however, made him realize that he couldn&#39;t stay in his apartment anymore. He couldn&#39;t live among humans anymore. He would surely be captured and studied and... Lily! Though his mind was intact, he could no longer speak. How could he ever explain THIS to her? How would he even keep her from running away? His heart heavy, he concluded that he had to leave her behind. He turned to the refrigerator to take one last look at some photos of the two of them. As he turned away, he let loose a painful howl before opening the apartment door with his huge paw and prowling away into the night.</p>
