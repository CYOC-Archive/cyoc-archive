<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Corey led Ethan over to the weights, I took my chance to pull out my notebook. I was wondering just how much I could really get away with. Not that anyone else should assume that this is some all-powerful device capable of changing all of reality, only that I wouldn&#39;t get all kinds of weird stares from people. Though Ethan did look back at me to make sure I wasn&#39;t about to leave him. &quot;I&#39;ll just be a second,&quot; I said. He bared his sharp canines for just a second. &quot;I just got an idea. I&#39;ll be right here. Alright?&quot; I plopped down onto one of the benches. <br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s eyes stayed narrowed. But he followed Corey over to the free weights. I pulled out the notebook and wrote, &#39;Corey Johnson naturally produces the same amount of chemicals that Pro bodybuilders put into their systems. Because it&#39;s natural, he doesn&#39;t have the same negative side effects using those substances at such a young age would have. He&#39;s been working diligently ever since he&#39;d hit puberty to be as big as he possibly can be, yet he never sees himself sees himself as big. Every time he looks in the mirror, he sees himself as though he&#39;s just the same 160ish pound 5&#39;9&quot; guy he is despite being 6&#39;2&quot; and over 240 pounds. His body is still growing, but because the influx of chemicals in his body only happened when he was 18, they haven&#39;t taken their full effect yet. By the time he graduates, he&#39;ll be closing in on 7&#39; and over 400 pounds of pure lean muscle that&#39;s built in proportion with a body builder. Only then will he feel as though he is an average gym bro size.&#39;<br />
<br />
It was a lot to write, but the magic didn&#39;t seem to take any longer than any of my other writings. The ink lit up and then turned back to it&#39;s black color. I looked up to see that Corey was reaching for the sky. His back, legs and arms slowly started to grow longer. He was closing in on Josh&#39;s height, but then it stopped. The lean muscles he had looked so much thinner with the added 5 inches in height, but that rapidly changed as muscle started to pile on. His shoulders quickly grew wider. Then rounded out into thick cannonball shaped masses attached to his sides. The growth rapidly ran down his arms. Thick biceps bulged out of the front of his arm, while perfectly sculpted horseshoe triceps extended from the back. His forearms doubled in size. A lattice of veins running down to his hands. The dexterous and lean fingers quickly bulged with power and strength. Easily being built more for strength than speed.<br />
<br />
Veins bulged out of his skin as blood pumped faster through his system. It flowed faster through his body as his pecs pushed further and further from his chest. Two heavy muscles extended out in front of him, pressing hard against his shirt. The tiny nipples poking out suddenly grew a bit wider. Corey&#39;s sleeveless shirt was starting to have a bit of trouble as his traps around his neck grew upwards and his lats grew outwards. The shirt was suddenly containing nearly twice as much as it had been. Sliding up his stomach and showing off the bottom half of his abs. His waist naturally grew to help support his new size and his abs pressed hard against his shirt.<br />
<br />
All at the same time his legs were filling out. The flexible black shorts with a red strip, were starting to strain against their new confines. Thick defined quads bulged out of his legs. Each muscle was clearly defined and molded the shorts to his legs. His ass ballooned out from behind him, testing both the fabric and the stretchiness of the band that held it up around his waist. His calves turned into hard diamond shaped masses that spread out wide. Somehow, he made it look easy to have massive calves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; my breathing grew haggard as I watched the change in size. His body just seemed to double in size, and no one even noticed. Not even as his toes grew outside of his shoes. The white sock he was wearing looked like they were struggling to hold back his feet, but the shoes didn&#39;t stand a chance as his feet grew at least 3 sizes larger and went from thin to wide, tearing the top of his shoe away from the sole. But maybe no one noticed because his clothes started to repair themselves. Anything that was ripped or torn started to grow back around his body. It shaped itself just like it had been before anything had changed. And not a single one of them missed a beat.<br />
<br />
I stared blankly as another idea popped into my head. &#39;Corey is indescribably knowledgeable of working out and nutrition. He loves training anyone who will listen to him. He never gets frustrated as long as the other person is willing to adapt and work with him.&#39; The already broad smile on his face only turned more genuine as he led Ethan through a couple of the exercises. Each time watching as their biceps bulged at the top of the rep and then relax at the bottom. <br />
<br />
There was one more thing I thought about as I watched them workout. &#39;Corey isn&#39;t able to grow any hair below his neck.&#39; Instantly his skin became baby smooth. His sweat glistened off the bright lights of the gym, making him look even bigger than he had before. Still a bit of curiosity ran through me.</p>
