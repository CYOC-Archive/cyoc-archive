<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two things became apparent to Renee as she finished her first week at Lolita. There was no cure and there was no escape.<br />
<br />
Despite planning, investigating, and doing there best to try and groom the guards, Renee and her friends quickly realized they were stuck. The unit they were in currently only held the four of them. The block itself was like nothing she had ever seen. Composed mostly of plexiglass with vents far too small to fit in.. Renees cell had but one entrance that led to a shower and a day room. As far as interaction with the C.O.s there was none. The officers did not speak, conducting tours before returning to their stations. <br />
<br />
It did not mean that the C.O.s didn&#39;t pay attention though. Renee had tried to get an officers attention, asking for soap and other cosmetics. The officer obliged but when asked about anything bot work related he would not answer. While she thought it rude, Renee quickly learned one of the big rules at Lolita. Don&#39;t rock the boat.<br />
<br />
That rule was made plainly clear by Lt. Patrick. Renee and the others had tried to cause trouble, covering their cell window in order to talk with the brass. This type of behavior usually worked, alllowing inmates the opportunity to see what they could do to make their bid easier. That wasn&#39;t the case in Lolita.<br />
<br />
Much to the three womens surprise instead of talking the C.O.s came in full force, useing pepper spray and a set team to remove the three women from their cells. Renee recalled how much her eyes burned as well as how much her body ached following the cell extraction. What was worse was Patrick&#39;s warning. We go easy the first time, next time wont be so pretty.<br />
<br />
As the week completed all three women were shocked by what they saw. They were definitely younger. Instead of three women in their late 40s, they appeared to be in their late 30s. Renee had noticed the improvements slowly but surely. Her face didn&#39;t have any crows feet around her eyes, her breasts appeared a little perkier, finally the grey in her hair had completely vanished. While being 10 years younger would have been a dream come true for the women, looking at Selena made it sink in what was in store for them.<br />
<br />
Selena was just 22 now. The former hard talking woman reduced to someone barely out of her teens. Selena face had lost that hard edge, having rounded while her body appeared much leaner than that of her former adult self. The Hispanic woman now looked like she belonged at a college frat party instead of running the streets.<br />
<br />
Still Selena tried to maintain her hard edge, which only made Renee fell more downtrodden. Each of Selena actions to cause trouble were immediately met with force. Renee had watched as they would swiftly move in subdue her and then drag her out. What was worse was learning about the consequences of their actions.<br />
<br />
The groups first meeting with Dr. Webber told them of their ultimate fate. In only a few weeks they would find themselves reduced to the age of 4. Renee shuddered at the idea, she would be back in preschool before this was over. Selena obviously didn&#39;t take to kindly to the idea and had lashed out. What resulted was the ultimate deterrent.<br />
<br />
As Dr. Webber explained the girls would start at 4 but they could always end up younger. Selena&#39;s actions meant that she would now be reduced to the age of 2. The Hispanic woman of course screamed in terror as Dr. Webber had the guards hold her down as she injected her with more of the serum. After that things were quiet as the group settled into the daily routine of prison.<br />
<br />
Renee just went about her day, watching t.v., working out, or playing cards with her friends. The only interruption to this was the meetings she had with Dr. Webber.<br />
<br />
Renee hated these meetings. Escorted by three officers to medical, she was changed into a medical gown as they ran a series of tests. Renee&#39;s height was measured, her vitals taken, and she was weighed. Couple that with the blood drawn and she felt more like a lab experiment than a convict. What was even worse was the meetings with Dr. Webber herself.<br />
<br />
Renee hated talking with the woman. The doc talked down to her in the way a mother would talk to a young daughter. Renee had little doubt that the younger she got, the more matronly these conversations would become. After dealing with so many foster mothers over the years the last thing she wanted was a mother figure in her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like you have alot on your mind Renee, is everything okay,&quot; Dr. Webber asked.<br />
<br />
Renee scowled at the doc, she recognized that patronizing look every foster mother she had ever dealt with gave her that look. &quot;Yeah just peachy doc,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Except for the fact I&#39;m heading back to preschool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is for the best Renee,&quot; Webber sighed. &quot;I reviewed your records myself. You havent exactly had the greatest of lives since leaving foster care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it was my life,&quot; Renee countered. &quot;I was my own woman. My own adult! Now, now your just stripping that all away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m offering you a second chance,&quot; Webber replied, a kind smile on her face. &quot;A chance to fix all the mistakes you&#39;ve made. To have the kind of life that makes you a productive member of society.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renee scoffed, narrowing her brow as she glared at Dr. Webber. &quot;Productive member of society what a crock of shit. And if you had ever been In foster care you&#39;d know no one wants to go back to that hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Webber was silent for a moment, taking a deep breath as she now stared at Renee. &quot;But i was in foster care Renee,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;In fact it made me the person I am today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Renee gawked as the doc now told her story. Webber had been abandoned as an infant, raised by the state, until she was adopted by her parents at the age of 4. From there her adopted parents doted on her, the state workers always checking on her to see how she was doing. At graduation she fondly recalled how not only her adoptive parents but the foster care workers applauded her hard work.<br />
<br />
Renee simply scoffed once more, turning her nose up at Dr. Webber story. &quot;So your one of the lucky ones so what,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;I was in the system until I was 18. Unwanted, unloved, no one gave a shit so stop romanticizing the system its fucking broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear you say that Renee,&quot; Dr. Webber replied. &quot;I know all about you. How your parents died when you were 4. How you went from foster home to foster home. I really wish the system worked for you. Maybe, maybe this will give you a chance to get the kind of life you deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doubt it,&quot; Renee grumbled. &quot;Now are we done? I&#39;d like to go back.&quot; Dr. Webber nodded as Renee was now escorted back to the block. As she made the trip she could only sulk, these next few weeks were going to suck.</p>
