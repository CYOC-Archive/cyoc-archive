<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate and Alex worked quietly on their homework in a quiet section of the library and actually made good progress. For much of Nate&#39;s work things were rather easy. His history worksheet amounted to copying words from the textbook to it. It wasn&#39;t that hard to do. The big thing came when Alex got to his science homework and  Nate had found himself helping Alex out there. He wasn&#39;t great at science, Nate knew that Eric was far smarter there than he was, but the days assignment had actually rather easy for Nate and he was giving Alex some clues as to how he got the answers he&#39;d gotten. Nate barely restrained himself from chuckling at Alex&#39;s groans at the science homework.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that went well,&quot; Nate commented as the two of them left the library.<br />
<br />
&quot;Says you,&quot; Alex groaned, &quot;science is going to be the death of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
The class was essentially a basic intro into Chemistry and at times involved a fair bit of math as well as science. It was some of that combination that had given Alex a bit of trouble and demonstrated that he likely wasn&#39;t going to get into a career as a scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get through it,&quot; Nate advised, &quot;we graduate, go to college, graduate there, and get a good job... and you can forget everything about that class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate added a little laugh at the end, just to let Alex know that he was joking. Alex laughed back in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amen to that,&quot; Alex answered as the walked along, &quot;So... all that&#39;s left now is meeting your folks. You&#39;re sure they&#39;ll be okay with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded as they walked along, &quot;It won&#39;t be quite like Ben&#39;s joke earlier... but yeah, they should be fine with you. As I said earlier... the biggest issue and fear that I&#39;d had regarding the things they&#39;d been going through with their marriage and how my being gay would relate to that issue...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said they did respond well when they found out?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded with a smile, &quot;and really surprised me... but in a pleasant way. It was a surprise, but it was a good surprise. And it&#39;s from when they found out that they asked to meet you and set up tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what are they into?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really... teaching,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;Dad is an English Professor at the college... with a focus on literature and literature from the Elizabethan period in particular. And before Eric and I came along my mom taught elementary school... though I can&#39;t remember which grade she said she taught in Minnesota.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder you did so well with the science stuff,&quot; Alex teased, &quot;You&#39;re a teacher&#39;s kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric&#39;s actually the one who&#39;s into science,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;not me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex only laughed as they walked along and playfully punched Nate&#39;s shoulder. Nate laughed in response. The blow did him no harm and he knew that Alex was joking. And in a way it did feel good for Nate. The fun that they were having with regard to things in a way that wasn&#39;t just related their libidos as weres. It did feel a bit more normal and that did feel good. At the same time, Alex enjoyed learning some things about his boyfriend&#39;s family. They continued walking along the way from the library to the Anderson home when Nate noticed something on the other side of the street.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Eric, meanwhile, was enjoying his walk home with Julie from City Hall. The mission for the day had been in achieved and he felt fairly well with things. That Julie followed him was a surprise, as he had hoped that he could surprise her later with what he had learned, but it did work out for him in the end. He had already been leaning towards be a weremer in the sense of being with Julie, and what Martin had told him and only strengthened that. There were some things that still had him curious with some of the other were species, but now more likely to compare with what Martin had told him. Though he would wait for the moment to be right to become a were, and that was something that not even Martin could tell him.<br />
<br />
However, the right time would surely come, especially as he walked with Julie, arm and arm. Her presence made him feel warm and confident in life and secure in Moon Lake. He knew that one day he&#39;d join were society and would be Julie&#39;s merman, and as he looked into her eyes as they walked he actually looked forward to that. It would be magical just to be with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will certainly be interesting,&quot; Eric commented as he said to Julie, &quot;all the things that are ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Julie smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... your dad kinda said that for you love at first sight is a real thing,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;and while it&#39;s very sweet... how does that work? Do you see elements of my personality? Or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t really say HOW it works,&quot; Julie answered with a smile and a blush, &quot;I just saw you and knew that you were the only man I wanted to spend my life with... It&#39;s one of those things that&#39;s like werefoxes and their life/mate bonds that form between loving couples. It&#39;s something that just is, and is the source for some of the more magical/mystical origin theories for were-beasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric held her to him in a brief hug, pausing their walk home as they did so. He gazed into her blue eyes and smiled as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just being with you would actually make me believe in magic,&quot; Eric said to her, &quot;You&#39;ve helped me get used to Moon Lake and have been there for me... I&#39;d love you for that alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie said nothing, but her eyes seemed to twinkle in response. They were about to kiss again when a familiar voice called out to Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric! Hey, man, what&#39;s going on?&quot; came Nate&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
They both paused to see Nate and another teen that looked like he was Nate&#39;s age rushing across the street to meet up with them. Eric looked away and gave a bit of a frustrated growl before responding to his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to run an errand to City Hall,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;and Julie was visiting Mrs. Twist. We&#39;re now walking home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate blinked as he looked to Julie and caught her scent. It smelled something of fish, but she was also wearing a very slight amount of perfume to mask it. Possibly because the smell that fish gave off when out of water had never fully smelled good and the perfume was to mask that. He was soon quick to realize that this had to be the girl that Eric had made friends with and had thrown a pool party for just him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... hello,&quot; Nate said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, this is Julie,&quot; Eric introduced his brother to his girlfriend, &quot;and Julie, this is my brother, Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; Nate said to her, &quot;Eric&#39;s told me that you&#39;ve done a lot to help with all the... &quot;weirdness&quot; that goes along with Moon Lake. For that you have my thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope to do more than just help him adapt,&quot; Julie answered with a smile, &quot;I love him very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt very comfortable saying that. She didn&#39;t want to rush Eric into anything, but some of what he had said to her when their walk home began had given the indication that while some things might be rushing faster than expected between them, it wasn&#39;t something neither of them actually wanted to stop. She took Nate&#39;s hand and shook it in a friendly manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;And congratulations on joining your local werewolf pack,&quot; Julie said to Nate, &quot;I&#39;m sorry though that your family had to put up with so much regarding the rogue&#39;s actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nate smiled. He did look forward to things becoming more &quot;normal,&quot; or at least as normal as Moon Lake could be, but that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t like the thanks, &quot;and everyone is doing well... it&#39;s healed things in our parents marriage... surprisingly fast, I might add, and has let me be what I&#39;ve dreamed of being for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded as Alex came around to stand beside Nate. She knew who the other werewolf was, but as he came out from behind Nate, Eric took notice of his presence. Eric&#39;s raising eyebrows and questioning eyes alerted Nate to the obvious question that was coming next and Nate decided to introduce his brother to his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you ask, this is Alex Ramsey,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;he&#39;s the one who welcomed me into Austin&#39;s pack and is the man I&#39;m bringing home to dinner to introduce to mom and dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt good to say that. In a way it felt good to actually be open with who he was and with his sexuality. He didn&#39;t need to hide or repress anything. He could be there in the open. Julie gave Alex a soft nod and indicated to Nate that she had no problem with Nate being gay.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard a lot about you, little guy,&quot; Alex commented with a friendly smile, &quot;Nate says you&#39;re a real genius.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t quite say that,&quot; Nate pointed out while Eric gave an embarrassed smile and looked down to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say... I enjoy reading,&quot; Eric eventually answered weakly.<br />
<br />
Alex then turned to Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact from what I hear, he might give you a run for your money with regards to the best grades in your class,&quot; Alex commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t a competition,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides... I don&#39;t care if she has better grades or if I have better grades,&quot; Eric answered and then looked to Julie, &quot;the only thing I want to do with her... is grow old together.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twinkle in Julie&#39;s eyes returned, and Nate and Alex both gave a bit of a grin as Julie leaped into Eric&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you do more than just grow old together,&quot; Nate teased to his brother, &quot;I kinda would like to hear &quot;Uncle Nate&quot; in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s let that wait until we&#39;re older,&quot; Julie blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;any way, for the moment we&#39;re on our way home and figured we&#39;d join you. Is that a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Eric answered. The four soon resumed their walk. Walking with Eric and Julie forced Nate and Alex to slow down their pace a little, but it was a pleasant walk. He made sure to warn both Freshman of who they&#39;d get for their Sophomore science class and made them promise not to repeat anything. Both had by the time the Anderson home came into view. From there, Eric and Julie walked on, as Eric still had to walk Julie back to her home, while Nate and Alex stood at path that lead up to the front door. The Anderson car was parked on the driveway giving an indication that William had returned from the college for the evening and that both Anderson parents would be home to meet Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are,&quot; Nate said to his boyfriend and began to lead him up the path.</p>
