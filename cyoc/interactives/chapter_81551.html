<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ric picked up the old leather book that had been left on the floor. He flicked through the pages looking for <br />
spells to change his brother. Various ideas flicked through his mind. Fat, thin, muscular, taller, shorter, <br />
female, animals, mythical creatures.<br />
Before a decision was made, the hulking mass of muscle that was Francisco burst through the door, his penis <br />
was now hard as rocks and his face bore a look of anger.<br />
&quot;What the hell did you do?&quot; His voice was a reflection of his mixed emotions.<br />
Josh looked towards his brother, who was a completely different man in the eyes of Francisco. It took him a <br />
moment to realize that the eighteen year old with a growing erection and the body of a god was the thirteen <br />
year old he was tasked with looking after. The next thing to catch his attention was the old book, he vaguely <br />
remembers to two boys sitting on the sofa reading it prior to his change. It clicked in his mind, what ever <br />
that book was, it was the cause of his transformation.<br />
He looked around to Josh, who remained unchanged and fully clothed. And then the mirror above the boy caught <br />
his attention. He saw his body standing over seven foot off the ground, the cock that he had desired for his <br />
entire life, the muscle that even professionals would trade their soul for. His anger was replaced quickly by <br />
lust.<br />
&quot;Pass me that book,&quot; He looked directly into the eyes of Ric<br />
Both in awe of the amazing man in front of him, and in feel of his strength, he handed over the book. Mr. <br />
Mendez turned to the twelve year old who had an obvious erection growing in his trousers. The page that Ric <br />
had left was intended for him, it was obvious. <br />
&quot;non magis reflexum iocatio&quot; <br />
The spell had no physical resonance on Josh, he just felt a warm spreading through his body, like a toned down <br />
version of the orgasmic wave that rushed over both his brother and teacher.<br />
Upon opening his eyes, he was faced with the monster of a cock presented to him by Mr. Mendez. A strong hand <br />
pushed on the back of him head, forcing him to engulf the prostate in front of him. His arousal from seeing <br />
his brother and teacher change caused him to submit quickly. He bobbed his head up and down the the giant <br />
member, the hand of it's owner forcing it deeper and deeper into his mouth. His then realized the spell's <br />
intention, anybody by this point would be choking and gagging on his dick, but Josh wasn't. He continued to <br />
take Mr. Mendez's cock in his mouth, occasionally coming up for air. Soon the penis started to throb,and a hot <br />
gooey liquid ran down Josh's throat. It was Ric's turn now. His member was much smaller compared to his <br />
predecessor, but it would still be a challenge to anyone else. Josh was somewhat hesitant at first, Ric being <br />
his brother and all, but he was still yet to have any sexual release, so he resumed licking, stroking and <br />
sucking. Soon after, he felt and hand on his ass. Mr. Mendez was preparing him for the massive cock he was <br />
about to be penetrated with. He looked back briefly as a finger entered his anus, probing him. He continued to <br />
suck his brother as wave upon wave of pain and pleasure hit with each finger that entered him.<br />
The large cock entered him suddenly. With gasps and cries of pleasure, the large head was completely in. <br />
Josh's carer didn't intend to ease the boy into it. He very soon caught up speed and was ramming half of the <br />
prostate into the boy. Simultaneously, Ric came in his brother's mouth,hot liquid spilled out of the member. <br />
Francisco then lifted Josh into the air, exposing his erect penis for his brother. It was no more than 5 <br />
inches, thus Ric's decision to pick up the old book which was on the bed behind him.<br />
&quot;Augmentum Verpa&quot;<br />
The words sent a palpable wave of pleasure over the boy. His penis grew with every ram from the man behind <br />
him, 5 inches, 6, 7, 8. Soon the prostate reached 12 inches, at which point the growth stopped and his brother   <br />
returned the favor his brother had previously given him. <br />
His body being so young, he quickly came over the face of his brother. This didn't stop Ric, he continued to <br />
play with his brother, forcing him to tense every muscle in his body. The grip around Mr. Mendez's cock <br />
tightened, and he blew a load into Josh, causing his entire body to reverberate. Josh dismounted the lowering <br />
penis. <br />
&quot;That was fun&quot;</p>
