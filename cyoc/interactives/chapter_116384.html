<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice&#39;s evening was somewhat quiet, particularly after the detective and his helping officer left. That was to a great degree the way she preferred things. Noise and chaos could be distractions that caused trouble and could well mean that she couldn&#39;t focus on things she needed to. Those things often related to her own personal drive and a drive that had been there for a very long time, ever since Archibald Tyree ran off a female werewolf in 1957. She&#39;d truly loved him and wanted the sort of happy ever after that was always in the story books, which her own mother had raised her on, but that jerk of a male wereraccoon ran off with a trashy werewolf and hadn&#39;t even set foot in Moon Lake since. <br />
<br />
The fact that Archibald had been the most popular boy in High School made the overall situation even more painful for Alice. She&#39;d bragged back then to all her friends that she and Archibald would get married, have kits every fifteen to twenty years, and sell sweets to Moon Lake at levels that it&#39;d give even a were diabetes. When Archibald ran off, she&#39;d been utterly humiliated. Her friends didn&#39;t stop being her friends, but she did get teased a bit on the mistake that she&#39;d made and a couple of Moon Lake Normals ultimately at one point even defended Archibald for when she tried to respond to the teasing. Her friends did back down and apologized for the jokes, but by then the damage had been done. No boy had defended her and no boy had volunteered to hunt Archibald down and beat him senseless for wronging her and those Normals even defended him. They would pay for that, she had vowed... they would ALL pay, and nothing would stop her. Not even her own children.<br />
<br />
And so, she&#39;d gone through her adult life knowing she had the body to seduce any Normal male, except for those that were gay, but she supposed they couldn&#39;t hurt women the way she&#39;d been hurt. So, she&#39;d flirt and date and lead many young Normal men to her bedchambers, turn them and carry their children. She deliberately made sure these liaisons occurred at times when she was in heat for that month and that she hadn&#39;t taken her own birth control pill for the specific assurance that she would become pregnant. After that, things happened fairly typically. The men that had no sense of responsibility &quot;dumped&quot; when they found out she was pregnant and she hit them for child support with the knowledge that if she won the lawsuit, they would HAVE to be responsible and she could keep tabs on them, which she hadn&#39;t been able to do with Archibald. Those that were more responsible were a bit tricky, but there she&#39;d actually managed to get them into a position where they agreed to separate and that they&#39;d legally agree to help support the child. With the exception of the two Statute 1A charges that had been leveled against her, Alice had made it through these things without too serious difficulty and that had often augmented her earnings from her sweet-shop, which wasn&#39;t too bad.<br />
<br />
The biggest problems for Alice had ultimately been when her children ultimately found out about how others had viewed Alice for her actions as an adult and getting even for what Archibald had done. Megan had even pressed her on it hard in one argument. Many did keep her family name and she hadn&#39;t lost contact completely with all of them, but that didn&#39;t mean that things went particularly easily with them. Megan had done the most to try and get her to see things differently, even tricking her into going into therapy once, but a lesbian werecat wouldn&#39;t know about the evils that men did and she wasn&#39;t about to back down.<br />
<br />
That had her presently busy in her own kitchen. Her present target had seemed to reject her seemed quite willing to accept being a weretiger, though she also couldn&#39;t be sure as he&#39;d also shown signs of being in heavy mourning for a deceased wife. In this, it was entirely possible that he wasn&#39;t so much eager to be a were as he was coming out of mourning. However, either had resulted in him not showing the obvious interest in her that her previous conquests had, and that was something she couldn&#39;t let stand. <br />
<br />
So her base idea was to take her original idea with the Love Potion Number Nine and apply it with the daughter, Melissa Jenkins. The idea was to get the cookies to Melissa and that she or her father would eat the cookies. A part of Alice even fancied the idea of Harold and Melissa sharing the cookies, which would work out perfectly. Harold as a were, wouldn&#39;t be able really resist Love Potion Number Nine and Melissa would have a hard time saying &quot;no.&quot; Harold would then transform his own daughter and could very well impregnate her as well and that would effectively ruin Harold Jenkins&#39; future in Moon Lake. Even if he could legally prove that neither he nor his daughter wanted to be drugged, the fact that the&#39;d turned and impregnated his own offspring wouldn&#39;t set well. Incest, while it did happen, was not well supported, even in Moon Lake. The embarrassment would hurt and Virginia would never date anyone that would essentially rape their own child.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll accuse me of forcing it, but they&#39;ll find no proof of any of that,&quot; Alice spoke to herself, &quot;nothing I&#39;ve ever planned is committed to paper and neither do I run any recording devices. There are no Nixon Tapes for them to find.&quot;<br />
<br />
And there Alice was confident. She knew the police were suspicious of her actions, but she had things arranged so that true intent could never be proven, at least not with the most serious actions she&#39;d ever undertaken. It&#39;d protected her from Statute 1A and for the moment would likely protect her from the worst they could do with regard to their present investigation. They might lay claim that she hadn&#39;t informed Harold Jenkins that the peanut brittle was laced with Love Potion Number Nine, but she could insist that she thought she had things prepared for that. She might have to pay a fine, but it would&#39;t be as bad as other penalties she might face.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem that Alice had was that she had no real idea on how to get her newly made and laced peanut butter cookies to either Melissa or Harold. She figured that a standard delivery wouldn&#39;t work and that Harold in his decision to reject her wouldn&#39;t accept the peanut brittle just to spite her, not knowing that he&#39;d simply never liked peanut brittle. A part of her pondered having Virginia be the one to give Harold and Melissa the laced peanut butter cookies, but the delivery service might pick out that she was the one who had posted the delivery order, which at the moment would cause some trouble for her. She saw a pickup truck parked on the street when she returned home and not being familiar with license plates figured that Harold had bought an old truck for his daughter and thus didn&#39;t know that the truck belonged to Trevor Tyson. It gave Alice a few ideas on trying to sneak the box into the cab, but for the moment she shot that down herself, as she was certain the police would be keeping tabs on her and that if she essentially broke into someone&#39;s vehicle to leave a box of cookies, that&#39;d only make the police more suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;The perfect revenge,&quot; Alice thought, &quot;foiled by too much attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
She ultimately figured that she&#39;d try to make it seem as though Virginia had ordered a box of peanut butter cookies delivered to Harold and Melissa, but she&#39;d actually wait until the present heat had died down a little. She could toy with officers for the moment, but she also knew that if she pushed things, it&#39;d have the chance that either she would slip up or the police might become so frustrated that they&#39;d take their anger out on her. She&#39;d need to buy her time for the moment, as while she was managing to stay ahead of the investigation, it wasn&#39;t by much and mostly on the grounds that the evidence the police had was circumstantial. Better to wait than rush something that would only get her in trouble, as Yvette Smith had done.</p>
