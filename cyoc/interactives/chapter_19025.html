<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul followed Don out, but made a quick turn towards his own bedroom.  For the first time <br />
in a long time, he just wanted to hide.  There were so many things to feel uncomfortable <br />
about -- his nakedness... Don's sudden assertion of authority... his reduced stature... <br />
having his sensitive balls explored by his son's giant tongue barely even 60 seconds ago.  <br />
The last item on the list was as thrilling as it was alarming, and his dick pulsed warmly in <br />
response to the memory.  Paul quickly ducked in his room and latched the door.<br />
<br />
The sound of muffled voices and kitchen clatter penetrated the door as Paul stepped away <br />
from it.  At least Don was doing his part with the younger boys.  But the sound brought <br />
Paul back to the fact that he had yet to have dinner.  The evening had been filled with one <br />
interruption after another.  Sitting on the bed, he looked across to Matt's house.  It was <br />
dark; the Lairds had obviously gone out someplace.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Paul layed down with the covers open and closed his eyes.  In a few minutes his <br />
other boys would be in their rooms and he could put on his bath robe and sneak down to <br />
the kitchen.  The idea of sneaking around his own house did not appeal to him, but all the <br />
sex had left him tired.  He wasn't going to have another orgasm any time soon, and the <br />
prospect of explaining his missing inches to Brett or Bryan did not appeal to him.  Maybe <br />
he and Don could manage this secret somehow.  He heard the familiar pounding of one of <br />
his boys' feet up the stairs and started to relax.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; it was Brett.  He had stopped in front of Paul's door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Brett,&quot; Paul called back from the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don says you're shrinking.  Is that true?&quot; Brett asked.<br />
<br />
The word had not even fully left Brett's lips before Paul felt forces tugging on his balls.  <br />
They were delicate, though massive.  Paul put his strong hands around them for <br />
protection, but of course it had no effect.  They wriggled and contracted, drawing closer to <br />
Paul's crotch.  Although it was over in a second, the process had taken much longer than <br />
before and left his balls even smaller.  The pulling sensation quickly climbed out to the <br />
end of his dick and started reeling it in.  Paul watched, speechless, as his cock narrowed <br />
and shortened before his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Brett's insistence tried to penetrate Paul's daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Paul mustered as the waves of contraction finally abated on his penis.  He felt his <br />
face flush as the rest of his body raced towards the smaller size that his balls had set.  <br />
&quot;That's nonsense,&quot; Paul called, feeling his head pulled towards his shoulders and the <br />
center of his body as the words left him.  His fingers shortened as he curled them around <br />
what was left of his cock.  It throbbed and swelled, growing sharply with the passing of a <br />
single heartbeat.  Somewhere in the back of Paul's mind, he knew this was a illusion -- his <br />
hands were shrinking to become proportional to his dick's new, reduced size.  But the <br />
feelings in his body were much more like his dick and balls were suddenly enlarging, <br />
becoming heavy and demanding.  His hard-on stiffened in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your voice sounds funny,&quot; Brett replied.  Paul looked back up at the door.  He knew only a <br />
few seconds had passed, but it seemed much longer to him.  The door seemed much <br />
further away now, nine feet instead of its typical six.  Paul didn't know his precise height, <br />
but it had to be in the neighborhood of only four feet.  Naturally that would make his voice <br />
higher, he reasoned, and decided to keep his mouth shut.<br />
<br />
Recovering his normal state of consciousness, Paul suddenly realized that Don had gone <br />
straight to the kitchen and told both of his brothers.  A combination of fury and fear <br />
began to rise -- fury that Don would undermine him so instantly and completely, and fear <br />
that now this house would be impossible to control.  The mixture of emotion and <br />
exhaustion quickly wilted Paul, removing any chance of an easy recovery of his full size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be stupid,&quot; Bryan's voice came through the door as he walked past Brett in the <br />
hallway.  &quot;Don was just playing with you,&quot; he said.  Paul listened intently, wondering if <br />
Bryan held the key to keeping things in check.  &quot;People can't shrink.&quot; Bryan added firmly.<br />
<br />
Despite Bryan's doubt, Paul's balls reacted immediately.</p>
