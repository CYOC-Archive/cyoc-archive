<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This will all be lovely for the future,&quot; Molly commented to me as we began to put away the garbage that accumulated as we opened the few wrapped gifts that we had under our tree.<br />
<br />
We didn't have that many wrapped gifts. Those that we had were mostly from my parents or Molly's Uncle. The gift we had for each other, according to our own plans was hopefully growing in Molly's womb. After more then a week of mating, Molly's mating scent was getting weaker. That was enough to me to believe that we were successful and that Molly was pregnant. We still wanted official confirmation, but that would take some time. Getting confirmation on when that could be done could be answered by two people. <br />
<br />
One was Leon, who knew the most about the Animatrix Serum, and could do the best in terms of theorizing on things. But his wife, Jacki, was probably close to delivering triplets and probably didn't have time to be a nurse to Molly and I. The other option was Mr. Patten's cousin, Clemens. His work in a zoo might allow him to at least confirm when they are able to confirm when animals in the zoo's breeding programs were pregnant. In addition, according to what I had heard from Molly, and she had heard from Joseph Patten at the school, Clemens followed a lot of news reports on things related to the Animatrix Serum rather closely, and as a scientist in his own right, that could be a great help. <br />
<br />
And we had sent that request to Clemens as a &quot;just in case&quot; sort of thing. If it turned out that he couldn't help with answering the question to when Molly could confirm that she was pregnant, we'd wait a month which was the normal length of time that humans that were deliberately trying to have children waited, and when people who had &quot;accidentally&quot; started a family found out that new life was blossoming. It would take time that way, but we could both wait. We had waited over a year to start our family. A month wasn't that long a time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it would be lovely,&quot; I nodded to Molly as I stuffed a paw-full of wrapping paper into a large garbage bag, &quot;the books I'm sure will be loved... at least if we have a male cub... and the camera... that'll give us things to get nostalgic over in the far future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nostalgic?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we're old, our noses have gone black, and the little cubs we had have all grown up and made us grandparents,&quot; I gave a soft smile, &quot;we can watch the films we will make of them when they were little and reminisce over raising them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly only responded with a slight &quot;chuff&quot; and moved over to give me a hug, wresting her head on my shoulder. I'd finished tying up the garbage when there was soft knock at our door. Someone else had come to visit our cabin. Again, neither of us knew who it could be, as we didn't know that Amy, now Amos, and Marcella were going to visit us on Christmas Day. Molly was the one who answered the door. It turned out to Frank Rhoer and Molly's cousins, Nessie and Meredeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Frank!&quot; Molly gave a gasp as she opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merry Christmas, Molly,&quot; Frank Rhoer said to her with a polite smile, &quot;How are things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Molly answered and lifted him into a hug while her cousins came in, shutting the door behind them, &quot;we just finished opening our presents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were very nice,&quot; I spoke up, &quot;Molly and I will need to find an appropriate place for it to stand... or maybe figure out a way to hang it on a wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There should be a spot on them where you can hang the photo on a wall if you want,&quot; Frank Rhoer commented as Molly released him from her hug.<br />
<br />
I nodded as she did so, and as he stepped aside, I noticed he was wearing the jacket we had given him for Christmas.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think of the jacket?&quot; I asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's very nice,&quot; Frank Rhoer gave a nod, &quot;and Molly, it's very kind of you to think of me as the best uncle ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are,&quot; Molly told him, &quot;You really are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'll enjoy your gift for a very long time,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how goes the baby making?&quot; Nessie then asked, the tone of her voice being somewhat teasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe George and I were successful,&quot; Molly answered slowly. <br />
<br />
The pride in her voice was evident, but there was some surprise as well. We'd been busy enough in expecting the mating season to come and handling other matters that I couldn't remember if we'd told Frank Rhoer what was coming for us and what they would likely hear. It appeared though, that Nessie had figured it out anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't disturb you in any way, did we?&quot; I asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;although my daughters and I have had a habit of sleeping like rocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom commented that she'd have to poke us repeatedly with a broom-handle to get us up for school,&quot; Meredeth quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're sorry if we scared you,&quot; Molly told them, &quot;It was mating season... and George and I... we really want to have a family of our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;Your roars were heard... but no one came down to us bloody or anything like that, so it was pretty obvious that the two of you were enjoying yourselves.  And I was young and in love once... both of you are entitled to your own personal happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe your cubs will be ranchers,&quot; Nessie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;but we don't know for sure that Molly is pregnant yet. That will take a while to do, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll let us know when you know for sure?&quot; Frank Rhoer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll let everyone know,&quot; Molly smiled and hugged her Uncle again.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer and his family stayed with us through much of the afternoon. Much of it involved talking about how each other's Christmas went. Molly and I told them about my old children's books being sent to us to read to our own cubs and the video camera to record the things would come in the lives of our children. The report that our gifts to each other earned a few &quot;awws&quot; and half snickers at the apparent &quot;preparation&quot; for the mating season that Molly and I had gone through. Frank Rhoer would remind his daughters that that was our right, but the exchange had been in good spirit and we all had a good time.<br />
<br />
It was close to evening when Frank, Meredeth, and Nessie Rhoer headed back to their home. Molly and I waved goodbye and then moved to get things ready for our own dinner and then to head to bed. I would have to return to work the next morning, and so we couldn't stay out as late as we had before Christmas Day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we ought to check our Email before going to bed, George?&quot; Molly asked as she set our steaks in the oven to cook, &quot;See if Clemens replied?&quot;<br />
<br />
This got back to where my thoughts had been earlier in the day. Clemens could provide considerable help when it came to figuring out what would be the likely timetables that we would face. Whether it would be identical to a human's time period because we had once been human, or identical to a tiger's because we were now tigers ourselves, or whether it would be something different, as we were not mundane tigers. We were tiger-people. And since Clemens did not have three cubs that were due to be born soon, he might have the time to dig up the answers we were looking for, or at least give us a good guess. But with today being Christmas, I didn't entirely think it was entirely the best time to expect any quick answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we ought to give him time to come up with an answer,&quot; I told Molly, &quot;It is Christmas, and you said that Joseph Patten went down to Florida to see his Cousin. I doubt he'd have much time to either check for all the information. Let him enjoy his Christmas. We've waited this long to get started. A few days... or a week or so wouldn't hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was not the answer Molly wanted to hear. She wanted to be a mother badly. I knew this, and there was a good part of me that wanted to be a father just as bad. And to be honest with myself, I sighed, knowing that if asked what I WANTED to do, I wanted to see if he answered to. Molly's question, however, had been over what we SHOULD do, which was something totally different.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I think we should do,&quot; I told her, &quot;we don't want to pester anyone... especially when there is a lot of this that we are fairly ignorant about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know because we've never done this before,&quot; Molly answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've had sex plenty of times,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with the frequency of this past week or so and not with the intention of becoming parents,&quot; Molly countered, &quot;I want to know... I want to know... I want to be a mother... to have little fuzzy cubs to nuzzle. To lay in their beds and keep them snuggled under their blankets. So see them play in the snow.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly moved from the dinning room and gave her a hug, &quot;I know Molly. You know that I want those things too... with the obvious difference that I would be a father, not a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned a small laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what I want,&quot; I told her, &quot;but we must do what is right. We can not expect Clemens Patten to drop everything he's doing and serve as our private pregnancy doctor. We'd probably need to see someone for that. Let us expect him to enjoy his Christmas with his cousin and possibly his girlfriend... after all, everyone is entitled to their own vision of happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, George,&quot; Molly said weakly.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next couple of days went quietly. I did return to the patrol duty with the Columbia Falls Police Department on the twenty sixth. The return to duty included the questions about how successful the mating season with Molly had been. It earned a few &quot;congratulations&quot; when I told Officer Barnes, Officer Jenkins, and Officer Howard that Molly and I thought we were successful. The patrols were fairly quiet with no major incidents beyond what were considered fairly routine calls. The biggest single incident that was had was rescuing a deer that had apparently gone through thin ice on some farmer's stock-pond. It took Officer Barnes and I, a couple of animal control officers, and one game warden to get the deer out of the pond and onto solid ground. Once that was done, the deer took off and was not seen again.<br />
<br />
Even with the continuing of these quiet days, a good portion of my mind dwelt on the potential answer to our second set of questions and whether or not Molly and I would have to wait a month to confirm medically that Molly was pregnant. I knew this was also on Molly's mind as with her mind, her instincts privately certain that our mating season was successful, we found ourselves talking about various subjects related to what would be done for them. What color blankets to buy. What sort of toys were appropriate to buy for newborns. There was a great deal of excitement and anticipation about becoming parents on our part, and when I wasn't working, talking with Molly about those things was a fairly good pastime.<br />
<br />
And then one evening, after returning from another quiet day of patrol, I found Molly waiting for me at the door to our cabin, grinning from one end of her muzzle to the other. Something had happened while I had been at work that made her either extremely happy or had her very excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... anything happen to day?&quot; I asked her, very curious about the grin she had as I came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clemens answered my... our Email,&quot; Molly said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't go looking for it?&quot; I asked, with the implication that she was checking her Email to expect Clemens' answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was just checking it for the day,&quot; Molly answered and then produced a small slip of paper, &quot;I printed it out so you could read it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The paper included all the of the identifier's of Molly's Email and included Clemens' reply. While Molly shut the door, I began reading.<br />
<br />
It read: &quot;Dear Molly and George,<br />
<br />
First thank you for the wishing of a Merry Christmas. Joseph and I had a grand time, and Jenny was very pleased to meet him. As for your comments on our weather, you'd be surprised. Florida doesn't get as consistently cold as Montana does in the winter, but there are the odd and occasional snow and ice storms. Some of them hit Georgia pretty hard a couple of years ago, and Georgia is not that far north from where I am in Florida.<br />
<br />
As for when your pregnancy... congratulations. Hopefully they have arrived when Jennifer and I come to visit Columbia Falls again in the coming summer... As for when you can confirm with a doctor or with any medical equipment, I'm afraid that this is where my zoo knowledge wouldn't entirely be needed.<br />
<br />
Because Animal People and things related to the Animatrix Serum are so new, in many places many local news teams have taken to covering births, pregnancies, marriages, transformations through consensual sex and other related things. Some national &quot;gossip&quot; news stations have even done the same, and major news networks are quick to publish reports on many of the developments related to the Serum. Your friend Leon, won't or can't say much at present outside of official press releases as even with his skill and knowledge there is still so much that he can not be certain on... and many good experimental scientists generally don't publish that much until they know for sure. The fact that the Animatrix Serum has been allowed to be sold to the public, despite technically being in a very &quot;experimental&quot; stage will probably hamper a lot of what Leon can and will tell you.<br />
<br />
Anyway, based on what news has covered on various Animal Person pregnancies, most of the pairings have been with Animal People of the same species such as yourselves, or at least with species that are capable of crossbreeding, such as different breeds of dog, house cat, and even some wild animals, such as a wolf and a domestic dog (though some scientists will tell you that the dog is a subspecies of wolf), or the lion and the tiger, for example. From most of these instances, according to the news the mating was deliberate in the sense that they, like the two of you, were deliberately trying to have children. They've all found that it takes roughly one month to confirm the pregnancy, though the tests needed to be run will need to focus on the animal species' pregnancy hormone... not a human's... so the pregnancy tests bought over the counter wouldn't work. From these cases, it may be the best to wait a month and see... Especially if the two of you instinctively feel successful in your mating. That should be a good sign to the both of you.<br />
<br />
Also, for additional information, the shortening of your pregnancy, Molly, as it has for Jacki Washburn, boils down to the active hunting lifestyle of predatory animals. Tiger cubs are born &quot;premature&quot; in the sense that they are not fully developed to allow the mother to continue hunting to provide for them. This short gestation period has been observed in many zoo tigers as well, though because of a more steady access to food, there have been some occasions where the pregnancy has gone slightly longer, but not by much. And so your pregnancy will probably mirror Jacki Washburn's in many ways. Your cubs will develop at the same rate human babies do in the womb, but once you get close to the sixth month, or perhaps shortly after, your body will be ready to give birth to keep you physically ready to hunt and feed them... and here, the closeness between you and a mundane tiger will be good as your cubs will likely also have the innate strength continue to develop after they are born. So you needn't worry about a pregnancy being completed after six months or so... even though that is three months premature in comparison to a human's nine months. I wouldn't advise you ignore a doctor's advice or prevent doctors from deciding to keep them in the hospital or clinic, as they will be just as concerned about their health as you are. Their work will probably allow them to become even stronger then they would otherwise... and given the strength of large mammalian predators, like the tiger, they would be strong, even at the small size a tiger cub is in comparison to its parents.<br />
<br />
And based off of what I've seen on the news, Molly, your litter size is one thing that could vary heavily. Many animal species give birth to multiples, and the Animatrix Serum has allowed for Animal People to produce more offspring per &quot;litter&quot; then humans normally do. However, it would appear that the Animatrix Serum also limits how many the specific Animal Person female may have. It's a compromise between the human and animal sides. And that seems to be based off of the range that human women have been known to have. Humans normally only have one child per pregnancy, with twins being the most common multiple birth, though a fair number of triplets and even quadruplets have been born. And the Animal People that have had children have been kept in this range. They have had more then one, but so far, none have had more then four... which would be extremely good for those that have become various species of reptiles and amphibians. I make fairly decent money in my job and Jennifer will make very good money in hers... but neither of us make enough to put sixty kids through college... (sixty being the common clutch size of eggs laid by the African Rock Python in the wild). Four might be tough, but much more manageable then sixty.<br />
<br />
Again, congratulations on the new family you've started and I hope see them when Jennifer and I come up in the summer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you've enjoyed the reply?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Molly nodded with a smile, &quot;granted we'll have wait till the end of January to know for sure, but know we know.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;And it's not like that would be too much of a problem. Neither of us have ever smoked... and each of us quit drinking any alcohol after our respective transformations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded, &quot;Now I suppose, all we have to do is find the appropriate doctor in a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
And our first wedding anniversary was spent in the calm confidence that we would have a family. We would have to thank Clemens for all his help, as his response had helped us put an ease to the anxieties that we had had over the issue of whether or not our mating was successful. He deserved that.</p>
