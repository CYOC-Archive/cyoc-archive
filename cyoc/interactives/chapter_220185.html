<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron pushed Lindsey in her wheelchair down the hallway as Kara and Milo followed behind the two people who had walked in on them sleeping in the hot tub as after they had had sex. Lindsey with her legs fused from the knees up had to use a wheelchair while Aaron’s legs where totally covered with green scales and his feet looked like he was wearing flippers now.<br />
<br />
“How long have you two been here?” inquired Kara <br />
<br />
“Three days, but everyone is different.” Explained Lindsey “Most take six to seven days or so to transform into mermaids or merman but I know a guy who just finished becoming a mermaid and that took almost three weeks while others have taken less than three days.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” confirmed Milo<br />
<br />
“Don’t believe what you read in the books; most changes happen while a person sleeps not when a person is awake.” stated Lindsey as they turned a corner and entered a lavish-looking dinning hall. <br />
<br />
The hall was a swimming pool as well. With water that went about waste high up while the tables and the back of the booths were above water. A ramp led down and without missing a beat Aaron pushed Lindsey’s wheelchair down into the water. Once in the water Lindsey began to swim with amazing ease and so did Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Well, we are going to be swimming a lot in the future anyhow.” stated Milo as the two of them followed suit, they where still mostly human so where no where near as fast as the other couple they just meet. However that was nothing to be ashamed of as all around were mermaids and merman, mostly mermaids who were in the process of transformation. Some of them looked almost totally human still while others looked closer to being fully transformed. <br />
<br />
“Have a seat.” Said Lindsey as she sat down, that is when Milo and Kara noticed that below them the water waist high but instead had to be at least 15 feet deep. This confused them both until they noticed that Lindsey’s red mermaid tail stretched at least a third of that distance and others had longer tails than her.<br />
<br />
“The menus are on the tablets.” Explained Aaron as he picked up a tablet from the center of the table. “It’s waterproof so don’t worry.”<br />
All of them looked down and saw a very large menu which everything had almost one would expect to find in a good restaurant. It was heavy on the fish but that was to be expected. <br />
<br />
“What is this?” inquired Kara as she pointed to the drinks.<br />
<br />
“Ah…merpeople don’t drink water, it’s some kind of seaweed with different flavors mixed in.” stated Lindsey “In the second level, it’s all they serve, and more sea food and coral is served. So, if you want some beef or something get it now.”<br />
<br />
“Coral?” inquired Milo <br />
<br />
“Ya.” Confirmed Aaron “Our taste buds change as well as everything else. We can eat coral and seaweed. Think of them as the fruits and vegetables of the under-sea world.”<br />
<br />
“Great.” Said Milo his voice full of sarcasm. <br />
<br />
“Could be worse, the sex is amazing as merpople I have been told ours has improved I will tell you that.” Laughed Lindsey as Aaron blushed a bit as Lindsey’s ran her fingers up his arm. “But that is something we wouldn’t fully know until everything is said and done and we are on level 2.” <br />
<br />
“Level 2, that is the level which is fully underwater?” inquired Milo<br />
<br />
“Yes, that is where they help people learn how to live underwater.” explained Aaron “Everything from how to brush your hair and use the bathroom to sex and the like. They have a crash course on how to handle gender change down there. After that we swim out into the community as a whole.”<br />
<br />
“I hate to ask, but how does one know if you have changed genders before any changes happen elsewhere?” inquired Milo, clearly worried about his own manhood. Currently his balls had gone inside his new partly fused merman upper half. “I mean Lindsey your mostly transformed already are you sure you will not change?”<br />
<br />
“I could, unlikely since I am a woman but once your groin is fully covered and your junk is within you all you have to do is look at the scales.” Stated Lindsey “On a woman the open is a vertical slit on a merman it’s Y shaped. If in the morning you wake up with your manhood within you check the slit, a straight up and down, sorry you’re a woman now a Y shape you’re a man.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sorry if I was rude.” Stated Milo<br />
<br />
“Not a problem.” Stated Lindsey “So let’s eat.”<br />
<br />
That night, Milo and Kara arrived in their room. <br />
<br />
It was rather bare, with most of the room dominated by the bed which was semi sunk into the floor. The bed itself was made of padded foam and lacked even a blanket. The thing which was weird was that the bed actually was wet which should have been off putting but strangely wasn’t.<br />
<br />
Once again, Kara and Milo made love, Kara ridding on top of her boyfriend while he held onto her hips moaning each other’s name. Once again Kara felt Milo’s seed enter her body, praying it wasn’t the last time she would feel him within her and if it was then she prayed they had a child together at least. <br />
<br />
“I love you.” Said Kara as she lied down beside her boyfriend “No matter what.”<br />
<br />
“No matter what…” said Milo as both of them let sleep take them even knowing that caused the transformation into merpeople speed up.</p>
