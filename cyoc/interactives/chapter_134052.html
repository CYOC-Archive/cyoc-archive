<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shortly after Anija healed Karyu completly, the demon dragon slowly got up, &quot;Thank you Anija, you&#39;re my saviour.&quot; said Karyu as he gave a soft smile, Anija smiled back, &quot;Say, how&#39;s your baby doing?&quot; asked Karyu as he looked at Anija&#39;s belly, the angelic dragoness smiled as she placed her scaled hand on her belly, she closed her eyes as she smiled, &quot;I think i will give birth in just a few days.&quot; said Anija, her face quickly shifted into a serious look as she thought about giving birth, Anija made an audible gulp, &quot;You&#39;re scared about giving birth, aren&#39;t you?&quot; asked Karyu as he crossed his forelegs, Anija slowly nodded, &quot;I-I heard it&#39;s really painful.&quot; said Anija, this made Karyu smile, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, i know Vaestro will be there.&quot; said Karyu, attempting to cheer the angelic dragoness up, &quot;By the way, how does it feel being an Anthro?&quot; asked Karyu, &quot;It feels kinda weird, yet pleasant.&quot; said Anija, &quot;It actually feels pretty comfortable being capable to stay on two feet, i think that i will remain as an Anthro for a little more after i give birth.&quot; finished Anija, as she looked at an antique clock, &quot;You should go to Luka, she&#39;s probably worrying about you.&quot; said Anija, &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; said Karyu as he prepared to go back to his rider, &quot;And again, thank you Anija.&quot; finished Karyu as he took flight, returning back to his Rider.<br />
<br />
Karyu slowly sneaked inside the bedroom, he looked at his Rider, who was asleep, Karyu slowly got up and laid near Luka, he ran one of his paw on her soft skin, Luka didn&#39;t react at all, she was still mad with him, even after those several nights, Karyu made a quiet sigh as he fell asleep, attempting to cuddle his Rider.<br />
<br />
It was barely the morning, the sun didn&#39;t even reveal itself, Karyu woke up, unlike other dragons, demonic dragons do not require sleep, but that doesn&#39;t stop them from resting, Karyu carefully got up and left the room, before leaving the room, Karyu looked at Luka, who was still asleep, he decided to use this time to return the books about the &#39;Arts of War&#39;,  Karyu gently picked up the books, which were unharmed, he quickly took flight as he went to one of Elisa&#39;s scholars, giving the scholar the books, who promised to return them to her library, Karyu then quickly returned back to his Rider, who barely woke up.<br />
<br />
Luka was preparing breakfast, the smell of fried eggs and bacon filled his nostrils, it was delicious, Luka held two plates with the food as she placed them near her, one was for her dragon, meanwhile the other was for herself, Karyu and Luka sat near each other, Luka quickly started downing the entire plate, meanwhile her dragon stood there, staring at the innocent eggs and the appetizing bacon, when Luka finished her food, she looked at Karyu, he didn&#39;t look as sick as he was during those nights, she raised one of her to touch Karyu&#39;s forehead, the fever was gone, &quot;Karyu what&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Luka, with a worried voice, this made Karyu smile a little as his Rider started worrying about his health, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; replied Karyu, with a broken voice as if he was about to break down into tears, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Luka please forgive me, i don&#39;t know what made me want to harm people, i don&#39;t know what made me so power hungry, please.. I beg you...  Forgive me.&quot; begged Karyu as he looked down, waiting his Rider&#39;s verdict.<br />
<br />
Luka stood there, a smile formed as she hugged Karyu, &quot;That&#39;s my dragon.&quot; said Luka with a happy voice, as she kissed Karyu&#39;s forehead, the demonic dragon slowly raised his head as he looked at his beautiful Rider, who was smiling at him, Karyu quickly nuzzled Luka, &quot;I promise i will never think about doing such things again.&quot; said Karyu, Luka slowly broke the hug, &quot;Come on, you need to eat, after all, this is gonna be a special day for both of us.&quot; said Luka with a wink, Karyu remembered that today he and Luka will get their children out of the nursery! Joy filled Karyu&#39;s heart as he quickly downed the entire plate, &quot;Come on let&#39;s go!&quot; said Karyu, with an impatient voice, Luka giggled as she mounted her dragon, flying towards the nursery.<br />
<br />
Hours have passed, Luka and Karyu were wandering the kingdom, meanwhile Luka held her two Kinin children, a smile was on her lips as she finally undestood what motherhood felt like, Karyu didn&#39;t fly since he was scared that he was gonna make his children cry, the two of them reached their home again, Luka laid on the couch as she thought of possible names for her children, meanwhile Karyu stood near Luka, purring like a cat as his Rider patted him, also thinking of possible names.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Luka heard someone knock the door, Karyu instinctively looked at the entrance, Luka slowly got up as she went towards the doors, &quot;Who is it?&quot; asked Luka, waiting for an answer, &quot;A brother who wished to visit his little sister?&quot; responded a familiar voice, Luka gasped and without hesitation, she opened the door, being welcomed by her brother, Bartamus, and his dragon Teach, &quot;Bartamus! I missed you so much!&quot; said Luka as she hugged her brother tightly, &quot;I missed you too.&quot; replied Bartamus, &quot;Come on in, i have so many things to tell you!&quot; said Luka as she pulled her brother in the living room, his dragon following him.<br />
<br />
Luka and her brother spoke together, meanwhile Teach and Karyu were in the courtyard talking about their Riders.<br />
&quot;So, you changed your gender, erased most of the traces of your existence and mated your dragon to have children with him?&quot; Asked Bartamus as he looked at his nephews, a smile formed, &quot;Looks like it paid off, didn&#39;t it?&quot; asked Bartamus.<br />
Luka nodded, &quot;It did, i was never so happy.&quot; said Luka, &quot;By the way, Vaestro just recently had a romantic affair with his dragon, so i won&#39;t be the only one bearing children.&quot; said Luka.<br />
Bartamus gave a shocked look, &quot;Speaking of Vaestro,&quot; started Bartamus, &quot;did Anija and Vrack suffer the same &#39;species change&#39; like Karyu?&quot; asked Bartamus.<br />
&quot;They did.&quot; Said Luka, &quot;Anija became some form of angelic dragon, this made her quite emotional yet empathetic. But she also became a great healer.&quot; said Luka, &quot;Meanwhile Vrack, or rather Vrackie, turned into a fae dragon, the transformation made hir into a hermaphrodite.&quot; continued Luka, &quot;And lastly, there&#39;s my sweet Karyu who turned into a demonic dragon.&quot; said Luka, as she looked through the window, watching the two dragons discussing.<br />
Bartamus took small sips from a cup of tea, wondering if he should mate with Teach, he never found a female to suit his needs, he had to admit that his crew was always with him when he needed them, but none of the females were successful to have romantic affairs with him, Teach however, forged a bond so great with Bartamus that was slowly becoming the bond of a couple, he even had to admit that he wondered what it felt like having breasts, he even wondered what it felt like having intercourses as a female.<br />
&quot;Bartamus, are you alright?&quot; Asked Luka as she gave a worried look.<br />
Bartamus quickly shook his head, &quot;Yeah, i&#39;m alright.&quot; said Bartamus, &quot;I was just wondering what it felt like being a female.&quot; confessed Bartamus, as he looked down in embarrassment.<br />
Luka giggled, &quot;So you&#39;re thinking about having children with your dragon, aren&#39;t you, you dirty pirate?&quot; asked Luka teasingly, as she took sips from her cup of tea.<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah.&quot; Admited Bartamus, &quot;Anyways, could you tell me how it felt like?&quot; asked Bartamus as he tilted his head a little.<br />
Luka blushed a little, as she remembered her wild session with Karyu, &quot;It... Felt good.&quot; said Luka, &quot;I have to admit, it did feel painful.&quot; admited Luka, &quot;But slowly as each second passed, the pain went away, being replaced with pleasure.&quot;  said Luka.<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Said Bartamus, &quot;Can you change back into a male or are you forever stuck as a female?&quot; asked Bartamus.<br />
Luka shook her head, &quot;Even if i wanted to, i would never be capable to feel like a man again.&quot; said Luka, she slowly started inspecting Bartamus&#39;s body, trying to figure out how he would look like as a female.<br />
<br />
The two siblings kept speaking together, meanwhile their dragons were in the courtyard.<br />
&quot;Really?! The two newborns near Luka are your children?!&quot; Asked Teach, astounded by Karyu, who nodded, &quot;...And how did it felt like?&quot; asked Teach again, a blush formed on his scaled golden visage.<br />
&quot;It honestly felt much better than mating a drake or dragoness.&quot; Said Karyu, without any shame.<br />
Teach was still astounded, &quot;So, you fucked your Rider and then she gave birth to two Kinins.&quot; said Teach, he never wondered what it felt like mating a female human, infact, he and Bartamus never had intercourses with anyone actually.<br />
Karyu chuckled a little, &quot;Who knows, maybe you will find a hen to make love with.&quot; said Karyu teasingly, &quot;And if not, maybe your Rider might decide to live his life as a she, or you could simple turn into a hen so i could fuck you right here and now.&quot; finished Karyu, with a smirk on his scaled lips, Luka said that she didn&#39;t have any form of problems if Karyu had intercourses as long as the romance isn&#39;t between him and a female human.</p>
