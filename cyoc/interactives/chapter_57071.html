<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before our story begins I would first like to include a little spiritual belief to make this story a little more feasible<br />
<br />
Firstly I would like to tell you about a very real tantric technique called Trong-Jug<br />
<br />
Secondly I would like to explain what Trong-Jug is<br />
<br />
Trong-jug is a spiritual and mystical tantric technique used to:<br />
<br />
   1. animate corpses<br />
   2. travel as an animal<br />
   3. give its practitioners virtual immortality.<br />
   4. switch bodies <br />
<br />
&quot;Because the procedure is real, and lineage holders are active today, its implementation is always veiled under a thick coat of secrecy. Trong-jug is used this way:<br />
Having identified a healthy young victim, the adept transfers his/her Consciousness Principal (CP) to that vicinity. Using erotic projections to loosen the target's own CP, the adept &quot;hooks&quot; it through a lower orifice and removes it, causing (brief) clinical death. The practitioner's CP then enters the victim's body through its crown chakra and stabilizes at the heart chakra. The adept's original body is now dead, but his/her mind functions through its newly stolen body.....<br />
<br />
Trong-jug is usually done when the lineage holder has grown old or diseased. In this way, (s)he can pass from an aged weak body to a young strong one in a (theoretically) never-ending series......<br />
<br />
Lineage holders also like to emphasize the difficulty of the technique, but in fact it is fairly easy for those who have a good foundation in tantric yoga, especially phowa...&quot;<br />
<br />
I found this information on the Internet and was inspired to write a story<br />
<br />
Our story is about a 15 year old boy named Eddie who has just started his freshman year in high school. He doesn’t play sports, He doesn’t make good grades, and is the son of a single mother living in Ohio, U.S.A. He used to build model planes with his dad before he left to fight the war in Iraq. At least thats where he said he was going. In fact he actually ran off to Los Vegas. After Judith(Eddies mother) found out through divorce papers arriving in the mail one day she tried to keep it a secret but Maggie(Eddies older sister) overheard her and Mr.Slensburg talking about it over coffee one morning. as you can probably imagine Eddie isn’t very popular in school.<br />
<br />
due to his lack in popularity Eddie has many enemies in school. He assured his status as school wimp when he was found crying in the gym locker room after finding out the news about his father. Of course everyone assumed he was crying because he had to get naked in front of all the other boys in the gym locker room.<br />
<br />
His biggest problem was Kevin Long. he is the head of the football team, built like a brick shit house and extremely wealthy. Inheriting quite a large amount of cash from his father’s rich uncle. His father decided to go back to school and become a lawyer. While his mother went on to become a doctor still leaving them multi-millionaires. They decided it would be good character building to leave Kevin in a public school. They still find time to attend every PTA meeting and hold annual fundraisers for the school of course the largest donations come directly from the Long family. with their slogan “Two for one! Donate a dollar and we’ll donate two!” so as you can imagine he is virtually unfoulable in the schools eyes. Did I mention his older brother is a cop? but this isn’t the worst part about this school bully. He is also dating Stacy Beckhamm<br />
<br />
Stacy Beckhamm is a 5“2' blond with hair just past her shoulders, D size breast, and a tribal tattoo of a heart at the base of her spine. She has had Eddies heart since third grade and used to be his best friend until high school where she met Kevin. she normally wears short skirts or skin tight jeans and short cut tops and you can bet your bottom dollar that Kevin gets her all the latest designer clothes with daddies credit card. she is every 15 year old boys wet dream but if anyone says that out loud they have to deal with a beating from the highly jealous Long and his goons.<br />
<br />
and there is one last person I would like to describe before I begin my story<br />
<br />
Mr.Slensburg. He is Eddies creepy next door neighbor. he is in his late 60‘s and frequently visits Eddie’s mother. He is always asking questions about Eddie’s medical history but other then that not much else is know about Mr.Slensburg other then the rumors going around that he is a witch.<br />
<br />
Our story begins in Eddies room. The alarm clock is ringing loudly and Eddie still has a headache and a black eye from yesterday when he was beat up by Long and his goons for looking at Stacy from across the hall. <br />
<br />
“Get up Edward or your going to be late for school!” Eddies mother yells from down the stairs<br />
<br />
“Okay mom just a minute” Eddie says as he turns off his alarm and makes his way out of bed in the blue striped pajamas<br />
<br />
“I hate it when she calls me that” Eddie murmurs as he makes his way across his room to his closet to pick out a pair of khaki shorts and a blue shirt.<br />
<br />
he takes his clothes and walks out of his room down the hall to the upstairs bathroom. Eddie then lays his clothes on the laundry hamper and makes his way over to the toilet where he commences to  urinate into it.<br />
<br />
*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*<br />
<br />
a loud knocking sound at the bathroom door startles Eddie and causes him to urinate all over the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Twerp! Hurry up in there I gotta get ready for school” Maggie yells through the bathroom door<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah, wait your turn princess! I have business to take care of too incase you didn’t notice.” replies Eddie<br />
<br />
“Ew! Gross! Just hurry the fuck up or im going to pop that zit between your shoulders!” Maggie threatens<br />
<br />
Eddie finishes his morning ritual and begins to make faces in the mirror while mimicking Maggie<br />
<br />
Eddie pushes the black swollen part around his eye<br />
<br />
“Ouch!” Eddie exclaims as he quickly recoils his hand away from his eye<br />
<br />
Eddie then begins searching through the medicine cabinet for some cover up for his black eye<br />
<br />
“You better not be using my cover up!” Maggie yells through the door<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry I’m not” Eddie lies<br />
<br />
“You know I need that for my acne!” Maggie exclaims<br />
<br />
after applying the cover up to his face he then drops the makeup in the dirty toilet just to spite his sister and walks out of the bathroom<br />
<br />
“ok all your’s” Eddie tells his sister as he walks down the stairs<br />
<br />
“MOM!” Eddies sister cries loudly running down the stairs passing Eddie and knocking him face first into the welcome mat at the front door<br />
<br />
“Eddie pissed all over the floor and threw my cover up in the toilet” Maggie tells her mother<br />
<br />
Eddie slowly walks in and sits down at the kitchen table with his head hung low<br />
<br />
“Edward! you get upstairs and clean up your mess right now!” his mother yells scoldingly<br />
<br />
“What am I going to do? I am not going to school like this and I definitely am NOT going to use cover up that has been dunked in a dirty toilet” Maggie ask her mother<br />
<br />
“I am going to stop by the beauty shop and get you some new cover up out of Edwards allowance after work. In the meantime just try to borrow some from a friend at school.” Eddies mother tells Maggie<br />
<br />
“But mom thats not fair!” Maggie exclaims<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry honey it’s the best I can do. I have to go to work now. You guys try to be good while I’m gone and don’t cause any trouble at school.” Eddies mom says and she grabs her purse from the coat rack by the front door<br />
<br />
“Bye sweeties! Love you!” she yells as she walks out the front door<br />
<br />
“Great now I’m going to be known as that girl with acne for the rest of high school. thanks twerp” Maggie says to Eddie as he is coming down the stairs<br />
<br />
“No problem, glad I could help” Eddie replies<br />
<br />
Maggie makes a face at Eddie<br />
<br />
“Come on lets hurry up and eat so we don’t miss the bus” says Maggie<br />
<br />
after they finish their breakfast they walk outside and start heading down the sidewalk<br />
<br />
“I hate it when he looks at me like that. It creeps me out.” says Maggie<br />
<br />
“HA! your creeped out? he’s always if I’ve ever had any broken bones, do I have heart disease, or my personal favorite “do you have any fatal illnesses?” I’m afraid I’m going to wake up in a tub of ice in the old mans basement minus a kidney” says Eddie<br />
<br />
“hey maybe that could work I think I’ll give him the key to the house when we get home” says Maggie jokingly as she pushes him out into the empty street<br />
<br />
“Hurry up or you’ll miss the bus” Maggie yells as she runs towards the bus where other students are getting on<br />
<br />
as Eddie gets on the bus he is greeted by backpacks going down in every available seat except one. The seat next to Jacob Slocks. President of the school chess club, top of his class in every subject, and pocket protector to boot<br />
<br />
“How ya doin Eddie?” Jacob says with a smile bearing his braces as Eddie sits down beside him<br />
<br />
“Hey Cob” Eddie says to Jacob in a depressed manor<br />
<br />
“I thought I informed you that my nick name is no longer Cob and that it requires a prompt change to, blaze” Jacob tells Eddie in his lisp like voice skewing his S’s and Z’s<br />
<br />
“Sure blaze, whatever you say” replies Eddie as the bus takes off<br />
<br />
“So did you finish Kevin’s homework?” ask Eddie<br />
“oh I did more then finish it” says Jacob excitedly<br />
<br />
“on his math homework where it ask what is the mathematical formula for finding the area of a circle, I put Pi times diameter squared. The real answer is Pi times radius squared” Jacob lets out a snort as he laughs<br />
<br />
“Umm, good one. I guess?” replies Eddie<br />
<br />
“hey I have homework to do. Why don’t we just stay quiet the rest of the way to school. Is that cool with you Cob, er I mean Blaze.” Eddie lies to Jacob<br />
<br />
“Sure buddy! I need to commit a new chess opener I learned on the Internet to memory this morning anyway.” replies Jacob<br />
<br />
after the long bus ride to school Eddie goes through most of his day as usual with little to no attention from Long or his gang until<br />
<br />
“Hey shit stain! Glasses here tells me it was your idea to get me a B on my math homework.” A voice booms from behind Eddie<br />
<br />
Eddie turns around to see none other the Kevin and two of his goons Chief and Max<br />
<br />
“You think thats funny shit stain?” Kevin ask Eddie as his pushes him up rams him against his locker<br />
<br />
“No” replies Eddie quietly<br />
<br />
“What I didn’t hear you faggot” Kevin ask Eddie as he punches a dent in the locker beside him<br />
<br />
“I didn’t tell Cob to do it he just did” says Eddie<br />
<br />
“I didn’t ask you if you did it! I asked you if you thought it was funny dick breath!” exclaims Kevin<br />
<br />
“come on boys lets show Eddie here what we do to liars” Kevin tells his goons while pumping his fist<br />
<br />
Eddie knocks from the inside of is locker door<br />
<br />
*Bang! Bang! Bang*<br />
<br />
“HEY! is anyone out there” Eddie yells from inside his locker<br />
<br />
Eddie hears footsteps from down the hall<br />
<br />
“he’s in here Mr.Mcklacky.” Eddie hears a female voice say coming from just outside his locker<br />
<br />
Eddie hears a hammer strike the padlock on his locker door and the door comes open where he sees Principal Mcklacky and Dianne Smith standing outside his locker<br />
<br />
“get out of there boy.” says Principal Mcklacky<br />
<br />
“who put you in here?” he ask<br />
<br />
“It was Kevin Long sir.” Eddie tells the principal <br />
<br />
“I don’t know who your protecting Eddie, but you would do well to not go around blaming innocent kids for your mistakes” Mcklacky replies<br />
<br />
“but sir it was-” Dianne says as she is interrupted<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to hear another word of this from anyone. Understood?” says principal Mclacky<br />
<br />
“yes sir” both Dianne and Eddie say in unison<br />
<br />
“Okay now you kids get back to class” Mclacky says sternly and walks off down the hall<br />
<br />
“so whats your name?” Eddie ask Dianne<br />
<br />
“Dianne, and yours?” Dianne replies<br />
<br />
“I’m Eddie” says Eddie<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet your Edward” Dianne giggles<br />
<br />
“Don’t call me that!” Eddie exclaims<br />
<br />
“Whatever you say Edward” Dianne says putting emphasis on “Edward”<br />
<br />
“*Sigh* lets just get back to class before we get in trouble” says Eddie<br />
<br />
“Ok I’ll catch ya later Eddie” Dianne says as she takes off down the hall<br />
<br />
The rest of the day is pretty normal Eddie gets home, eats dinner, brushes his teeth, takes a shower, and goes to bed but this time while he was sleeping he has a lucid dream he is flying high in the sky far above the clouds looking up at space and down to the earth watching all the people go about their daily lives and all of a sudden he loses control of his lucid dream he is in a strange room with music playing that sounds like it is out of a porno flick<br />
<br />
“Hello?” Eddie says<br />
“I-I-Is anyone there” Eddie stammers<br />
<br />
all of a sudden there is a huge puff of smoke and Stacy Beckhamm is right in front of him wearing tight laugerie<br />
<br />
“Whats going on here? I didn’t make you appear? this is my dream.” Eddie says confused<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want me Eddie?” Stacy says with a pouty look on her face slowly inching towards Eddie<br />
<br />
“Wait no this isn’t right Wake Up! Wake Up!” Eddie says slapping himself awake<br />
<br />
Eddie wakes up in his room to see a transparent figure of Mr.Slensburg standing over him<br />
<br />
Eddie rubs his eyes and goes back to bed convincing himself it was just a bad dream.<br />
<br />
The next morning Eddie awakes and for some reason has all the memories of an ancient Egyptian King that transfered his mind into body after body until he went into Mr.Slensburg and finally tries to come into him when he woke up last night. Once more Eddie now knows exactly how to use the ancient method of Trong-Jug but what is even weirder he has a strange unexplainable desire to have sex with Maggie his older sister</p>
