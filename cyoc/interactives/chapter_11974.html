<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let's go back to the park&quot; said Jack and Eric.  &quot;Only lets switch breeds this time.  I'll be a mastiff this time and you be a border collie or another breed&quot;.  Jeff was excited about the prospect again, too.  But Tony demurred.  He'd had enough of being an animal.  Besides, he had this new body to get used to.  Tony begged off and went home with no hard feelings.<br />
<br />
Jeff and the guys were disappointed, but they had a great time playing frisbee and playing with kids as a mastiff, border collie and great pyrenees.  They even screwed a bitch in heat who took on all three of them in turn.  They did so with completely clear consciences because Jeff had arranged the settings of their canine bodies such that they only produced sterile sperm.<br />
<br />
Tony agreed to serve as their backup.  He carried a handful of dvd's home with him as backups to Jeff's system and he agreed to check on the status of the guys every day.  Jeff's sister and other family members were given a positive aversion to touching any of things or so much as looking in his room to eliminate any chance of a recurrence of the disastrous events after their first transformation.<br />
<br />
Still, Tony passed up on going wolf with his friends the next weekend or eagle with them the weekend after that.  His pals' acceptance of his reluctance started to turn to resentment.  <br />
<br />
Worse, in the first flush of being seen as universally desirable, Tony sometimes acted a bit haughtily about his striking good looks.  It was probably unavoidable.  Tony had no experience in every girl smiling at him, in parents all having a predisposition to trust anything he said, in even guys automatically preferring his company to that of less handsome boys.  He consciously tried to keep things in check, but sometimes didn't.<br />
<br />
Thus, a month after barely saving themselves, working as a team, three of the team members felt enmity toward their mate.  That was how they arrived at the situation of late one Saturday night.  Jeff, Jack and Eric had been drinking.  They'd flown around the town as eagles that afternoon. They talked about how great it had been and the conversation flowed, with the beer, into how Tony should have been there, how Tony should have been with them at least one of these times.<br />
<br />
Eric belched loudly.  &quot;All he wants to do is show himself off to girls.  I know it's all -burp- new for him, but shit, how 'bout your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked.  Jack and Eric smiled in response.  <br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no.&quot;  He smirked again.<br />
&quot;Come on, out with it&quot;<br />
&quot;Well&quot;, said Jeff, &quot;Tony wants to show himself off to girls, we can help with that&quot;.  He pulled the computer with chronivac and emitter out from the special compartment he'd made under the desk and glanced toward it with a mischievous smile.  Eric and Jeff broke into raucous laughter.<br />
<br />
Tony was at the library with Claire on Saturday night.  He'd met the slender strawberry blond sophomore at the mall the day before.  He thought he'd just bumped into her at the book store, but she'd actually seen him as he entered and had followed him halfway across the mall.  He didn't need to know that.  She shook her head smiling at him.  So gorgeous and such a geek.  It was amazing.  Saturday night and he wanted to check out something at the library.  She couldn't wait for the walk home and afterwords.  She sighed inwardly at those cheekbones watching him read.<br />
<br />
A wave of electricity went through Tony and he sat up straight. &quot;Ready to go?&quot; asked Claire.<br />
&quot;Um, no.  I-I've gotta check on . . another book&quot; he said while getting up from the table and hustling away.  Claire shook her head watching him walk quickly away.  What buns!<br />
<br />
Tony made his way quickly out the library and immediately started into a sprint.  He felt as though he was running on some kind of autopilot.  He had no idea where he was going but he felt absolutely compelled to use all his athletic ability and take a turn down this street then that.  Finally, he wound up at the girls' only school.  He slowed to a jog and noticed his clothes fading like smoke in a breeze.  In short order, he found himself standing naked on the top step of the main entrance to the building.  He adopted a certain prideful pose and felt his body becoming both hard and heavy.  In a matter of seconds, Tony had been completely transformed into a white marble statue.  <br />
<br />
It being Saturday night, no one was around.  Only a few people saw the life sized nude statue of a young man at the top step of the main entrance on Sunday.  No one said anything.  Jeff, Jack and Eric had several more beers and forgot about it Sunday.  It wasn't till late Monday morning when all three realized they hadn't seen Tony that Jeff remembered where he was.<br />
<br />
The girls school custodian tried to move the statue but the nude young man seemed to be super glued at the soles of his feet.  He couldn't be moved.  Every girl entering the school that morning walked past nude Tony.  And part of his transformation was that, somehow, he could see and hear and feel just as though he was still flesh and blood.  Every joke, every laugh, every giggle, every pat, every touch, every gesture he was aware of it.  Between morning classes, girls came outside and some wrote on him with lipsticks.  One girls skimmed the marshmallow off a cup of hot chocolate and left a dollop at the tip of his penis.  Some time late morning, a heavyset female teacher tied a shoelace around his waist and laid dish towels across his front and rear.  She had gone back inside five minutes when the dish towels were suddenly gone.  <br />
<br />
At lunch, nearly 50 girls gathered round and played a game of challenging other girls to eat parts of their lunch off the surface of him.  Things began mildly enough, with girls licking things off his stony lips but quickly graduated to filling the crack of his statue ass with sandwich fixings and trying to lick them all out.  This game produced raucous laughter but dissipated because the statues ass was too deep.  But inevitably, the girls gravitated to his penis.  Bets were taken that this or that girl wouldn't eat off his penis.  One girl had a can of cool whip.  She'd shake the can, apply a coating over the bottom half of Tony's statue penis and then a girl would be challenged to clean him off.  This went on for almost a half hour before a teacher stepped in and stopped it.  That afternoon, when school was out, it seemed to him that every girl in the school patted his buns on the way out.  School officials and custodians gathered around him trying to figure out how to deal with the situation.  One suggested simply adding a fig leaf.  The custodian said he could get a certain type of saw and cut the statue off at whatever height they wished. One thirty something teacher Tony realized he'd seen watching the girls lick whipped cream off his penis said they should leave it just as it was. <br />
&quot;Some of these girls should see just what a boy looks like and after a while it won't be such a big deal.  Maybe six months from now nobody pays much attention to boy apollo here&quot;<br />
&quot;Six months!&quot;  Tony thought to himself.  Awake 24 hours a day, naked in front of everyone, unable to move, with pigeons shitting on me!<br />
If he'd really had any exhibitionist in him, Tony might have found it racy and exciting.  He was still shy intellectual Tony at heart, though and he was mortified.  He figured that somehow Emma had gotten ahold of the chronivac.  If Jeff, Jack and Eric can't stop her again, I'll be like this forever!<br />
<br />
But late that night, he saw Jeff's car approach.  A sheet had been put over him when the school officials left for the day, but girls walking by the campus had pulled it off him.  The car pulled up to the nearest point of the circular drive and Tony saw Jeff lean out the window and point the emitter at him.  He felt a wave of electricity pass through his stone body.  In a matter of seconds, flexibility returned and he felt nearly as light as air compared to his condition as a statue.  The clothes he'd worn to the library materialized on him but he ignored the calls of Jeff, Jack and Eric to hurry up and jump into the car.  He undid his belt and his friends saw him fuss with both the front and back of his pants.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; <br />
&quot;Picking dried whipped cream and deviled ham out of my . . &quot;  He didn't finish.  He jogged over to the car and jumped in.<br />
&quot;So, that was you guys who did that to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry man, we'd had quite a few beers&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry man&quot;<br />
Tony shrugged and let it go.</p>
