<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christmas after the fury flu of November 2023 changed to suit the new anthropomorphic animal population. The mythos of Santa delivering presents to all the good boys and girls was tweeked by those that still believed in those stories. Instead of a bearded man in a red coat and black boots climbing down a chimney, it was changed to a Polar bear fury. Whether or not this was a corporate ploy by a particular soda company to marry some old commercials with a new society; it wasn’t the only reimagining of St. Nick’s origins. Another story being that he became an anthro reindeer fury; allowing the eight that already drew his sleigh to retire. Using a sleigh with rockets rigged to the undercarriage made for a color flourish for some. In Australia, Santa was being depicted as a red kangaroo fury. While in Norway, Finland and Sweden; the story going that Santa became a caribou fury and resides in his workshop in Lapland. Some countries in central Europe had the story that Santa retired; this forced Krampus; the demonic satyr like creature that use to torment bratty children to take up the mantle of Kris Kringle, delivering presents while still punishing children that misbehaved. While most of these were region related, all still agreed that Christmas in 2029 was more or less the one holiday that all cubs looked forward to. <br />
<br />
“Are you certain she is fast asleep?”<br />
Denise looking at her mate as he came down the stair; taking care not to make too much noise thanks to his deer like hooves hitting hardwood flooring. Looking at his tigress mate he just nod his head; the dozen points of his antlers glittering. Earlier before their cub Roxy had to go to bed; she had a fun time tossing tinsel all over her father. The tigress cub delighted as the tinsel dangled from her father; the lights from the Christmas bouncing off the metallic bits, creating a pretty light show on the various walls.<br />
“If you want her to stay asleep,” Michael removing the strips of tinsel off of him; doing his best to save as much of it as possible for the tree. “You need to collect the presents; &quot;you are light on your paws after all.”<br />
That is true,” Denise smiling as she gets up and heads upstairs; “no clipity clop from paw pads here.”<br />
<br />
Moments later she came back down with a few packages; handing them to Michael, the stag-deer fury begins to place them under the tree. Trying to stage it, Michael gets a half cough half growl from his mate; she came back down the stairs with another load of presents, some of these from Jimmy and Jake, as well as their mates. This repeated a few more time before Denise came down with the final load from where she managed to stash the wrapped boxes; this final load were small boxes of chocolate treats. Michael looked on curiously as Denise placed them in the various Christmas sacs designed to replace stockings.<br />
“You think that is too much,” Denise stepping back to see the Christmas tree and surrounding space filled with presents.<br />
“It will be worth it to see the look on Roxy’s face in the morning,” Michael blackening out the windows thank to his magic runes. He proceeds to do this for the remaining windows on the ground floor as Denise turns off the tree. The couple head upstairs; pausing to check in on their daughter sleeping soundly on her bed. The tigress cub lying on her belly, clutching her unicorn plushie.<br />
<br />
“You think we should have her snuggle with us,” Denise observing their daughter sleeping; “it feels a little chilly, but not cold enough to warrant a blanket.”<br />
“So no Christmas eve fun time,” Michael looking at his mate longingly; “may I remind you I allowed our daughter to dump metal painted plastic all over me.”<br />
“You’re a father to a five year old precocious daughter,” Denise quietly answering; placing the bedsheet over Roxy; “That is a prerequisite. But I have gotten use to our evening romps,” Denise turning to embrace her mate; “bed me my love; we have a long day tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
**************<br />
<br />
The next morning, both Denise and Michael were up; their amorous nightly rut helping them to fall asleep in each other’s embrace. Their fury bodies keeping each other warm as they sleep on a bed with a thin sheet. Their fur making wearing clothing an impossibility, as the fabric irritates their bodies and causes them to overheat. So when Michael felt Denise pull away from him, he smiled as his soft cervine phallus slips out of her feline snatch. Passing out after filling her with his seed; the antho stag-deer fury was still erect and in her.<br />
“Morning,” Michael trying to keep Denise close to him; determined to give her a few wake up kisses as she playfully tries to resist.<br />
“Merry Christmas you randy stag,” Denise responding in kind; “we need to get up if we are to complete the magical surprise for Roxy.”<br />
“More kisses later then,” Michael smiling; his cervine member starting to stiffen; smelling the arousal that is coming off of the tigress fury in front of him.<br />
“That and a pie in need of cream,” Denise getting up; making sure her tail lightly smacks Michael in his muzzle as she heads to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He was in the kitchen making breakfast; poached eggs on English muffins with ham. Michael opted not to make a hollandaise sauce; needing egg yolk and clarified butter, the anthro stag-deer didn’t want to serve his daughter a massively fattening sauce so he covered the makeshift eggs Benedict in a cheese sauce instead. Making sure to place fresh fruit on the plate as well as hot coffee for him and Denise; Michael grins as his daughter still a little sleepy is ushered into the kitchen.<br />
“Did you sleep well Roxy,” Michael putting a plate of cheesy soaked poach eggs infront of his daughter.<br />
“I wanted to sleep some more,” Roxy looking at her breakfast curiously and trying to determine how to attack it; “what is this?”<br />
“Poached eggs on and English muffin with ham,” Michael cutting into his as Denise gets some cream for her coffee; “with a cheese sauce.”<br />
“No hollandaise,” Denise looking at hers; popping the orange slice in her maw first before picking up a fork and knife to dig into the egg.<br />
“Too fattening,” Michael answering; observing Roxy as she looks surprised to see the yolk ooze out of the egg and mix with the cheese sauce; “the melted cheese seemed to be a more palatable compromise.”<br />
<br />
Breakfast passed relatively quickly; Roxy looking a bit more perkier once she ate some food and drank some juice. She was soon led to the living room. Seeing a large sheet blocking the room; the young tigress cub looks at her mother. Denise just grins as she encourages Roxy to watch the sheet; hers and Michael’s runes glowing and causing the sheet to dissolve. Once that happened, Roxy’s eyes just went wide as the Christmas tree lit up and she saw the massive pile of presents stacked under it.<br />
“Merry Christmas,” the two said as their daughter walked to the magical scene before her. Her face wide with delight as the presents look large and begging to be opened up. Turning to look at her parents, they encouraged her to pick a package. Watching as she grabbed the biggest one, both Michael and Denise soon joined her in the living room as the cub gleefully made a mess ripping the wrapping paper off. Roxy gasped as she saw the box contained an elaborate playset for a collection of figurines based off of her favorite cartoon series.<br />
“I do believe there is a present somewhere that has the dolls meant for that,” Roxy grinning as Denise grabs a couple that were meant for her and Michael; “but not all of them are from us. Some are from your older brothers,” Denise handing a rectangular present to Michael; “and few are from Santa.”<br />
“Santa,” Roxy beeming as she grabs another package and excitedly ripping it open; looking confused as Denise shakes her head with a slight chuckle. Letting her daughter know that some presents are not for her as the present she opened had a set of new mugs.<br />
<br />
“Well this is interesting,” Michael opening up on of his presents; I got a bottle of Goldschläger from Jimmy.”<br />
“What is that,” Roxy looking up; still hunting for those figurines that go with the playset earlier.<br />
“It is cinnamon Schnapps with gold flakes in it,” Michael putting it down; “looks like some hot chocolate is going to be a bit boozy tonight.”<br />
Denise smiled as she opened her package; seeing that it was from Brittany, the tigress fury quickly shut the case as she didn’t want Roxy to see the phallic looking sex toy inside.<br />
“What did you get mommy,” Roxy seeing her mother looking embarrassed as she closed the box.<br />
“Just a silly gag gift,” Denise trying to bury it under a few other items she got; “Brittany has a wicked sense of humor.”<br />
“Keep going,” Michael urging his daughter to grab another package; “there is more to open up.”<br />
<br />
It took another hour for the presents to be fully unwrapped; Roxy was already playing with the figurines she got. Michael promising to help her set up the palace set later as he looks at a few of his and Denise’s gifts. Seeing the toy Denise got from Brittany, Michael looked at his mate and shook his head. Whispering that the plastic prick would ruin her for him; she just wink and whispered in return; “it could be used on you as well.”<br />
It took Michael a moment for it to register that Denise could spice up their fun time with a bit of role reversal; her penetrating him anally with a dildo. Looking at his mate, Michael just sees the tigress flashing a mischievous grin. Watching as she picks up some of ribbon used for the bows; she surreptitiously places it on her crotch, implying that he has one last present to unwrap.<br />
“But this one is for later,” Denise grinning; taking the bow and putting it off to the side, she turns to watch her daughter as she proceeds to run around. Watching Roxy make silly noises as she holds one of figurines that have wings; using her imagination of it flying around.<br />
“I’d say this was worth the expense,” Michael sighing as he wraps and arm around Denise and pulls her closer to him; watching his daughter having a delightful Christmas day morning.</p>
