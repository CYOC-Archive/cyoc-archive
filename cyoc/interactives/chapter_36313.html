<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sit there staring at the blank piece of paper, thinking to yourself, &quot;Oh my God! I'm a girl! I can't be a girl!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly writing forms on the paper. Reading it you see the words form, 'If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don't matter'.<br />
<br />
Wanting to cry suddenly, feeling a weird because of your monthly, you fold the paper up and toss it onto another person's desk.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Gerald Anderson was really bored as well, mostly because he knew all this stuff already. He was what you'd call a geek, but he wasn't one to flaunt his intelligence. Sitting there, listening to Mr. Bard lecture on and on, Gerald chose to doodle on his notebook instead. Suddenly a note lands on his paper.<br />
<br />
Disgusted at the idea that someone wants to pass notes in class, he figures it's probably an insult and is just about to crumple it up, when curiosity overcomes him and he opens it.<br />
<br />
It a simple print, he reads:  To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here's a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, needing something to do, he begins the Questionnaire.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl....what would your name be?<br />
<br />
Thinking about it, he writes down the name, Stephanie Marie Kersh.<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl....would you like pink?<br />
<br />
He thinks long and hard on this question and then writes down, Yes, as well as teal and white.<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl....how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don't lie)<br />
<br />
Bothered by the question slightly, he looks around, wondering who had sent him the note. Wondering if this note is some type of joke. Tapping his mechanical pencil against the sheet of paper he begins to write. Height without shoes: Five foot three. Weight without clothes: one hundred and three. Age: Sixteen.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Gerald felt himself shift and he realized that the desk felt larger. Bothered by this, he was just about to look back at the note, when he saw the name written at the top of his notebook. It now read Stephanie Kersh. Wanting to stop, he instead looked at the next one.<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl....would you like ballet?<br />
<br />
Thinking it a strange question Gerald, now Stephanie, answered this with a Yes. After a second, he adds to this: Began ballet classes when I was six. Also Gymnastics. Did this until I was twelve.<br />
<br />
Suddenly memories flood Stephanie as he realizes that this is true.<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl....would you were a dress?<br />
<br />
Bothered by this, he answers with a Yes. And then as an after thought you add, 'But right now I'm wearing a size S/M pair of Bib Over-alls'. Not realizing it, his pants change into a pair of womans denim over-alls.<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl....what type of underwear would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
Without really thinking about it, he writes down that he is wearing a size small thong.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a pain overcomes his privates as his underwear changes itself into a tight fitting thong. Dropping the pencil, he runs his hands across the front of his over-alls, finally noticing what he's wearing an feels the outline of the womans underwear through the fabric. Wanting to stop, Stephanie picks ups the pencil and continues.<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl....what size breast would you have and what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
Hesitantly he writes down that he would have a size B cup and would be wearing a bra size B16, no padding, no under-wire. Suddenly he feels a pain in his chest as it pushes against the tight fabric of his shirt and over-alls. The pain continues for a bit as he feels a bra encircle and gently cup his breasts. Hoping that this is a joke and all will go away when he finishes, Stephanie reads the next one.<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl....what colour would your Hair and eyes be?<br />
<br />
Placing pencil to paper, he rights down,'Red hair that falls just past the shoulders and is pulled up into a ponytail. Bluish grey coloured eyes'.<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl....would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
Wondering about this question, Stephanie writes down that he would use tampons. Immediately he feels a pain in his abdomen and groin. A strange tickling sensation over comes his penis and testicles as they shrink and disappear. Suddenly, the area between his legs splits and the vagina forms. At which point somethings first begins to prod it and the enters. Sitting there, a cramping sensation creeping across the groin and abdomen, more memories flood in. Memories of mother explaining to Stephanie at the age of eleven that this is normal.<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl....would you pee sitting down?<br />
<br />
Thinking that that one is obvious, she writes down Yes.<br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl....would you wear jewelry and/or have any piercings?<br />
<br />
Thinking about a nice silver bracelet, Stephenie wrote down, 'Yes I would have a silver bracelet and my ears would have three holes in each. A pain in her ears breaks her concentration temporary, but then she pulls herself back to the questionnaire.<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl....what type of shirt would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
She thinks and answers that she would be wearing a tight white T-Shirt with the word princess printed over a picture of Hello Kitty in a pink gown.<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl....would you like boys?<br />
<br />
Thinking carefully, Stephanie writes down Yes. Her attention is distracted by a cute boy that would never go for such a plain girl like her. So intent on him, she fails to notice as the rest of her genitals form and her clitoris becomes hard and the clitoris hood slides over it. Suddenly, she feels like she doesn't want to continue the questionnaire, even though she is not done.</p>
