<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So this is my formal report with regards to the Duke of Hell, Gemory.  Ten years prior, Gemory was summoned to Earth by a mortal name Tony Ryan.  Tony made a pact with Gemory, forfeiting his soul to Damnation in exchange longevity, health, and power over women.<br />
<br />
He was careless, however, and never received those powers, instead being killed and dragged down to Hell by Gemory.<br />
<br />
The conjuring circle remained intact, as did the end result of the bargain.  A few days ago, the mortal Danielle Western touched the circle&#39;s boundaries, and Gemory appeared before her, attempting to sow mischief by concluding the terms of her bargain by giving her the powers Tony Ryan had asked for.<br />
<br />
Among these powers was the ability to make any woman fall in love with the wielder.  Danielle successfully used this ability to make Gemory fall in love with her, apparently since she didn&#39;t trust Gemory one bit, showing unusual levels of judgement and wit.<br />
<br />
However, being a mortal of good character, Danielle felt guilty about taking advantage of another person, even a demon, and attempted to treat Gemory as fairly as possible.  This caused a friendship to develop, which has quickly blossomed into actual love.<br />
<br />
I know that is hard to believe, but I have witnessed it myself.  Unless my ability to sense emotions is faulty (which it may be, as Gemory is a powerful demon, one of the original Fallen), Gemory&#39;s feelings towards Danielle are genuine.  To the best of my abilities, I judge this to be True Love.<br />
<br />
I, of course, bow to the judgement of those better suited to rate emotions of such intensity.<br />
<br />
Gemory has shown utmost care towards Danielle, and has even taken steps to -prevent- her from becoming corrupt.  It is my belief that this is an unheard of violation of the Luciferian Mandate, though, obviously, the situation is too complicated to call this a win.<br />
<br />
For instance, the two have contracted to be wed, with Danielle becoming Gemory&#39;s consort and gaining the title &#39;Duchess of Hell&#39;.  The ramifications of a mortal soul gaining such a status have not gone unnoticed by this agent.<br />
<br />
I personally witnessed an incident, which I will call Incident 01 from this point on.  Danielle has an estranged relationship with her mother, Natalie Western.<br />
<br />
I judged Natalie worthy of a level 2 Smiting for her mistreatment of her daughter.  However, before I could deliver this Judgement myself, Danielle used her powers to gain revenge on her Mother.<br />
<br />
The vengeance was...very harsh, and it nearly put Danielle&#39;s soul at risk.  As per the Raphaelite Scale, however, the anger and sorrow she was filled with, was due to her Mother&#39;s actions.  Thus I feel the sin falls on the Mother, not the Daughter.  Regardless, it was an intense moment, and had Gemory done nothing, she could have claimed Danielle&#39;s soul.<br />
<br />
Instead, she stopped the girl, who immediately felt anguish and remorse for her actions, which I am filing as further evidence of her good character.  <br />
<br />
I will continue to observe the interactions between Gemory and Danielle as long as Heaven requires, but I must also make a statement about a personal matter, <br />
<br />
<br />
PERSONNEL REPORT- Angel 1st Order, 2nd Class, Amielle<br />
<br />
I begin this report with the fate of Tony Ryan&#39;s soul.  Gemory transformed Tony into a Succubus, giving him a female form based on his own personal desires- ironic punishments are her forte, after all.<br />
<br />
Now known as Toni, she has served her Mistress well for ten years.  Gemory did not purge Toni&#39;s mortal memories, though she did disable her ability to change form.<br />
<br />
I first made contact with Toni at the beginning of my observation, and found her to be an ample resource for information.  In my interactions with her, I have found her to gentle, sweet, and kind, despite her demonic nature.<br />
<br />
This goes against my training and thus I am forced to consider myself to be Compromised.  I do not ask for forgiveness.  I am sorry that I have disappointed, but I am in love.<br />
<br />
Yes, love for a demon.  I don&#39;t understand it myself, but it is genuine and reciprocated.  I do not ask for forgiveness, because I feel I have done no wrong- love is a gift from God, and was it not the Son who said that Love was the highest Commandment?<br />
<br />
I am torn, however, since I still love God.  While I don&#39;t believe this will affect my performance, obviously, if you wish to replace me, that is your duty.  I, however, refuse to be reassigned.  If this means I must tender my resignation, and thus be cast out from Heaven, I accept my fate.<br />
<br />
I apologize especially to my supervisor, the Principality Diane.  I enjoyed our working relationship, and was looking forward to my promised bonus.  But I am no longer the Angel that I was.<br />
<br />
I am currently at the Kingsley House, which is watched over by the former Angel of Death, Mist of the Waelkyrige.  I am not taking refuge, however, and will answer summons.<br />
<br />
With love, Amielle, Angel of the First Order, Second Class.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Dominion loomed over Diane, who was no longer in her cushy office, but that of her superior.  She was standing naked in a circle of light, and had been given a copy of the report by a 1:1 (Angel, 1st Order, 1st Class).<br />
<br />
The Dominion was actually seated upon a marble throne, but it&#39;s height, coupled with her own nine-foot stature, made Diane feel especially tiny (to the point that she&#39;d actually shrunk without realizing it!).<br />
<br />
Diane would have gulped if she had ever been mortal.  Instead, she knew fear.<br />
<br />
The Dominion spoke, but softly, with one female voice instead of a multitude.  “Do you believe that Amielle was coerced to make this report?”<br />
<br />
“I...no, I don&#39;t, Dominion.  I admit I&#39;m surprised by the formality.  Amielle never struck me as being mature or particularly bright.” Diane admitted.<br />
<br />
“I have read her performance reviews, and that is a fair assessment.  In life, she was a simple girl who loved God with all her heart, but her upbringing was very sheltered, and led her to becoming very repressed.”<br />
<br />
“If I can ask...how did she die?”  Diane had been curious about this, but the records had been sealed.<br />
<br />
A frown marred the perfect beauty of the Dominion&#39;s face.  “I suppose there&#39;s no harm in you knowing.  She was kidnapped by a serial murderer and rapist.”<br />
<br />
Diane gasped.  “No...”<br />
<br />
The Dominion sighed.  “Her very last thoughts were of God.  She never denounced him, though her captor attempted to make her do so.  He was one of those depraved souls that has no love for God, and took sick joy in destroying the faith of others.”<br />
<br />
“Then he is dead.”<br />
<br />
“And consigned to the Pit.  Though I wonder if even Hell can come up with a suitable punishment.  Regardless, this report is troubling on many levels.  We will have to independently verify whether or not True Love exists between a mortal and a Fallen, but I can only assume that Amielle was correct that some level of genuine love exists.”  The Dominion looked sad.<br />
<br />
“Surely not!”  Diane gasped.<br />
<br />
“Though Fallen, Gemory was once one of us.  The capacity for love exists.”<br />
<br />
“But if it is True..we cannot intervene.  The child&#39;s soul will be lost.”  There were protocols for this sort of thing, after all.<br />
<br />
“Our hands are tied in many respects regardless.  Danielle Western&#39;s file is sealed by a higher authority, save for strict orders to not interfere with her life in any way.”<br />
<br />
“What authority?”  Diane asked.<br />
<br />
“The highest.”  Was the Dominion&#39;s reply.<br />
<br />
Diane shivered, and not from the cold.  That meant the orders came from the Metatron, the Voice of God!  “What of Amielle?”<br />
<br />
The Dominion folded her arms over her ample breasts.  “So the inference is true.  You had a relationship with your subordinate?”<br />
<br />
Unable to lie when faced with a direct question, Diane nodded.  “Yes.  I was fond of her, though..I didn&#39;t show it.  Perhaps if I had...”<br />
<br />
“We cannot dwell on should haves.  Though a violation of workplace protocol, Amielle is correct.  Love is the highest of Commandments.  We will have to send an agent to investigate.  Obviously, even if her love is genuine and reciprocated, she will have to be censured.  But perhaps she can still serve Heaven, just as Mist does.”<br />
<br />
“Mist.  I never thought I&#39;d hear her name again.”  Diane admitted.<br />
<br />
“This situation does seem to be attracting a fair number of wild cards.  At any rate, this won&#39;t go on your record, Diane.  I find you are at not at fault.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Dominion.”  Sensing her dismissal, she headed to the door.<br />
<br />
“Oh and Principality?”  The Dominion called after her.<br />
<br />
Diane turned.  “Yes, Dominion?”<br />
<br />
“Find a new girlfriend, you&#39;re way too uptight.  And treat her right.”<br />
<br />
Diane bowed her head.  “I will, I promise.”<br />
<br />
As she left the room, she realized she was going to miss Amielle.  Perhaps there had been more than affection all along?  She wasn&#39;t sure how to replace the girl, but she was starting to feel those urges.  The Dominion was correct.  She was too uptight.<br />
<br />
Time to remedy that.<br />
<br />
<br />
After the Principality left, the Dominion sighed again, and reached for her phone.  There was a bit of odd protocol here- even though the person she was going to call upon was beneath her in rank, they were highly respected in Heaven- a veritable legend!  “Get me the Archangel Raphael.”</p>
