<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen remained quiet on the what was likely the REAL reason Marci had never been with Ted before his transformation into a weretiger. Werecats, be they true werecats like Marci and herself, or male werecats were all homosexual or at least bisexual in nature, but that wasn&#39;t entirely the reason they didn&#39;t turn Normals of the opposite gender of themselves. The real reason was that their strains of the werevirus were mono-gendered and in more recent years geneticists in lab tests had found that a mono-gendered strain of the virus would kill Normal human cells taken from someone of the opposite gender. Marci would have likely killed the man she loved they had had sex before he became a were. That potential threat and danger was something that every werecat knew, and Jen and Marci were no exceptions to that rule. However, since the werewolf strain was one that could go to either gender, Jen had figured it unnecessary to get into too much with either Jeff or with Tad.<br />
<br />
Amy might be more aware of that, since she had grown up in Moon Lake and if the course load at Moon Lake Middle School hadn&#39;t changed, she likely had one of its classes that were put into its local curriculum that was designed to help weres approaching their first transformation when they turn fourteen be aware of the rules and laws that related their were forms and the instincts that would come in full force. Details were often left to individual families, but the school district, at least when Jen went through school, did include some general information to help weres approaching their first transformation  or at least let Moon Lake Normals be aware of many of the things their were classmates would soon go through to help make sure they either didn&#39;t worry about friends or put themselves at risk for an accident. Amy would surely be aware of all that and thus might be aware of that threat. However, Amy didn&#39;t comment on that, so Jen couldn&#39;t be sure and she didn&#39;t think that was really a concern to bring up with Tad. The comment on turning Ted gay would be a valid risk if he had mated with a male werecat just as if Jen were to mate with a normal human woman who was straight, that intercourse could turn that woman into a lesbian, and Jen figured that would be enough for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it sounds like the two of you have your own happy ever after now,&quot; Amy spoke up after a moment or two, &quot;The two of you must be happy with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; Marci smiled happily and reached to a side to take Ted&#39;s hand in her own. He smiled in response and rolled that and so that he hold Marci&#39;s as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did the two of you meet?&quot; Jen asked curiously, &quot;I know that weres have left Moon Lake or have lived outside of Moon Lake all their lives... so I&#39;d imagine that there are certain things that were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Difficult?&quot; Marci gave a chuckle and glanced to Jen while Ted resumed eating the steak that was on his plate, &quot;In a way... yeah. I had to be very guarded with who I dated and how far I went with them... And that actually got me in a bit of trouble that lead to our first meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marci paused to drink from the glass of water she had in front of her before she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was years ago... I was still in Law School and Ted was just out of the FBI&#39;s training academy at Quantico...&quot; Marci started.<br />
<br />
&quot;They train FBI agents at the Marine base?&quot; Tad wondered as he blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ted corrected, &quot;the FBI&#39;s academy is in the same city as the Marine base, but it&#39;s a different instillation. My training was primarily in law enforcement, which differs from what your father likely went through in his training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Marci picked up after the interruption, &quot;I&#39;d been seeing a different guy at the time. He wasn&#39;t too bad... fairly cute and actually fairly smart... but he turned out to be fairly forceful. At one point he decided he was ready to take our relationship to the next level, which I couldn&#39;t allow because he was a Normal and I am a werecat... and I mean a TRUE werecat. He didn&#39;t know that at the time and I wasn&#39;t quite ready to reveal that secret to him. So, I tried to say no and that I wasn&#39;t ready for it. He didn&#39;t take no for an answer and when I insisted, he got aggressive. He threw punches that I couldn&#39;t return, for fear of exposure and so on and tried to tear at my clothes. I managed to get away from him, but I&#39;d been stripped down to my underwear and ran into Teddy once I&#39;d gotten out of the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t a were then, and thus didn&#39;t know why Marci was nearly naked,&quot; Ted spoke as he swallowed the meat he&#39;d been chewing on, &quot;but I could recognize the threat this irate boyfriend posed and arrested him when he came chasing after Marci. It wasn&#39;t exactly the most romantic first meeting... but she seemed shaken... and well I can never really explain it. I just felt like I needed to help her and keep her safe. I&#39;d check on her as she finished her legal studies... but from there... we began growing closer and closer together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad watched as the two happily smiled to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;It soon lead to dates and dinners as we moved up, Ted to leading his department and me into getting a position as a lawyer in a firm operating in the area and handling a lot of various cases,&quot; Marci continued, &quot;Including constitutional law. But yet... career wise, that seemed to take a backseat to Teddy. I felt like I could trust him more than anything else. Eventually, I told him I was a werecat and explained the FULL reasons why we would have to wait to truly be together but that I loved him very much...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it was a surprise... to see the woman I love turn into a very beautiful Turkish Angora... but we&#39;d been together for long enough by that time,&quot; Ted said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;d fallen in love with the person to the point where the fact that she was a were wasn&#39;t a problem. We just had to wait until now where I could become a were and be with her in EVERY possible way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen found herself smiling at that. She was glad that he had someone and was happy. On some level it reminded her of what she&#39;d lost with Jeff, but the new were that she had invited to her house had brought her husband&#39;s killer to justice. So, thankfulness for justice overpowered her sadness at the loss of her husband. The two continued to hold hands smile to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ve had about five years of a happy marriage,&quot; Marci spoke, &quot;and now... I have my tiger. My big, strong, and sexy white tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully you have many more happy years ahead of you,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;Are you staying in Washington DC... or?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when we get to retirement age, I think we may move here,&quot; Ted commented, &quot;and you have a very nice town here, but that&#39;s still a few years in the future yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And very interesting with the whole wagon wheel shape,&quot; Marci added.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was something intended to allow all weres to remain close to nature,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;giving large predatory weres like werewolves...&quot; Jen then gestured to her son and Amy. &quot;... and weretigers room to hunt the large game that they prefer. As well as places to explore for smaller weres like werefoxes and werecats. Essentially... letting weres be weres.&quot;</p>
