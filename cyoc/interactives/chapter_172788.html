<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josie woke up slowly, feeling a warm, soft body next to her.  Forgetting the events of the previous day entirely, she snuggled up against her girlfriend, then rolled over to give her a kiss, a hand finding it&#39;s way to her breast.<br />
<br />
Cole woke up suddenly, feeling something soft pressing against her lips, and a pleasant sensation in her chest.  &quot;Josie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie&#39;s eyes snapped open fully, and she realized what she had been doing.  &quot;Oh shit!&quot;  She pulled away from Cole and practically leaped off the mattress.  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Cole!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole was blushing furiously.  No one had ever touched her like that before!  Should she be upset?  Angry?  She wasn&#39;t sure, but she knew one thing- it had felt good.  &quot;I...what were you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...forgot all about what happened, or that I&#39;m a girl now, I woke up next to a pretty girl, and I thought you were my girlfriend...&quot;  Now it was her turn to blush, because she felt pretty stupid.<br />
<br />
The two stared at each other for a moment, then Cole broke the ice by laughing.  &quot;We must look like a couple of idiots.  I was just surprised, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess sleeping naked was a bad idea.&quot;  Josie frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you only have the one outfit, so the only alternative was to have you wear one of my shirts- which would be huge on you.&quot;  Cole wasn&#39;t wearing anything but a pair of boxers herself.  Despite the fact that all the clothes in the apartment fit her, it was still basically all guy&#39;s clothes, with the exception of a few sports bras.  &quot;We need to go shopping today, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie noted that she didn&#39;t really mind being naked, though she wasn&#39;t sure if that was a trait from her old self, or Cole.  &quot;Well let&#39;s get cleaned up, then breakfast or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole was giving her an odd look, and she moved closer, putting her arms around Josie.  &quot;You know, that felt pretty good.  I wouldn&#39;t mind more of that.&quot;  She leaned down to kiss Josie.<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s lips were warm and inviting, and Josie felt like the room had gotten several degrees warmer.  Cole was well built, and soft in all the right places, while still displaying well-toned muscles.  Josie felt something stirring inside her.  &#39;Is this is what it feels like for a girl when she gets aroused?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole...one of us is just a kid, remember?  We shouldn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole silenced Josie with another kiss.  &quot;I&#39;ve never felt this way before.  Like I&#39;m going to explode.  I don&#39;t know anything about sex, but you do, right?  Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie knew she should stick to her guns, but Cole was such a pretty girl.  She ran her fingernails along Cole&#39;s flat, taut abdomen.  &quot;Ok..lay back down for me, then.&quot;  She wasn&#39;t sure exactly how tall Cole was, but if she had to guess, it was something like 5&#39; 10&quot; or 5&#39; 11&quot;, while she was a shrimpy girl of 4&#39; 9&quot;.  The height difference was making her feel quite self-conscious.<br />
<br />
Cole slid off her boxers, which fell to pool at her ankles.  She then lay down on her back, and removed the boxers.  Josie had shaved religiously as a guy, and that habit apparently was one Cole now possessed- though, naturally, she shaved different parts of her body.<br />
<br />
Josie got on her knees, and draped herself across Cole&#39;s body as she began to kiss her.  Cole&#39;s body smelled amazing, even though she&#39;d just woken up, and she looked so damn sexy.  Cole responded to the kiss immediately, and even if she&#39;d never done this before, it was obvious that she wanted it, bad.<br />
<br />
Josie began to wander down Cole&#39;s body slowly, kissing her jaw, then her neck, then she started in on her breasts, cupping one in her hand, while teasing the other with her tongue and mouth.  Cole started moaning softly with pleasure.  If she&#39;d still been a guy, Josie would have been hard as a rock.  The feeling of arousal was very different for a girl, but no less intense.  Reluctantly, she began to move lower, planting a series of kisses across Cole&#39;s abdomen, pausing to again admire her lady abs.  She&#39;d have to take steps to ensure Cole kept exercising regularly, in order to keep this amazing body.  Some inner voice overlaid Josie&#39;s thoughts.  &#39;Mine&#39;.<br />
<br />
She wanted Cole, bad.  She wanted to claim her as her own, despite the fact she now had the body of an underaged girl (or the fact that Cole basically was one).  She slowly moved lower, planting kisses on the soft flesh between Cole&#39;s thighs, her fingers tracing along the skin between those thighs.<br />
<br />
Cole groaned. &quot;Please...more...more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie grinned as she placed her hands on Cole&#39;s legs, pushing against them.  Cole got the hint, and spread her legs wide, giving Josie access to her treasure.  Touching the soft folds of her groin, Josie found that Cole was already wet.  She sniffed her fingers, getting a good whiff of Cole&#39;s scent.  It was pleasant, and Josie pushed her fingers into Cole&#39;s slit, rubbing and teasing the taller girl&#39;s clit.<br />
<br />
Cole bucked and her back arched.  She&#39;d touched herself before, and it had felt good, but nothing like this!  She&#39;d been curious about sex, but hadn&#39;t been ready for it.  That was before she&#39;d gotten this amazing, grown-up body, with it&#39;s grown-up needs!  She cupped her breasts, enjoying the sensation of playing with her own nipples, as Josie&#39;s fingers explored her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, please, Josie...more, I need more!&quot;  She reached down with one hand, her fingers running through the smaller girl&#39;s fine blonde hair, as she pushed Josie closer...<br />
<br />
Josie reached out with her tongue to lick Cole, and found she enjoyed the other girl&#39;s taste.  She&#39;d done this before, many times, so she knew what to do to bring Cole to her climax.  Cole was very loud as she was overcome by her first orgasm.  She wanted to feel this way forever!<br />
<br />
Finally, she lay back, gasping for breath, as Josie moved to curl up next to her.  Cole hugged the tiny girl close, and pulled the sheets over their bodies.  &quot;I love you, Josie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, just rest now.&quot;  She didn&#39;t know how she felt about Cole just yet, maybe love was something that was too soon, too early to say.  But whatever she was feeling right now, was very strong.  There was a strong connection between the two of them, and she enjoyed the way it made her feel.<br />
<br />
Sometime later, Cole&#39;s stomach made a growling noise, and Josie got up reluctantly, a pressure in her bladder telling her she had to go to the bathroom.  &quot;Ugh, stupid biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole sat up and kissed her again.  &quot;I think I like biology.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really got to go!&quot;  Josie dashed for the bathroom, hearing Cole giggle behind her.  There was no time for another bath, as Cole had a shift on Sunday, so they got dressed and went out.  Breakfast came from a drive-thru, and they stopped at the drug store to buy some hair dye and other sundries.  At the shopping center, they dyed Josie&#39;s hair, making her a ginger, which looked pretty good on her.  Instead of her ponytail, Cole braided the smaller girl&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, I&#39;m cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole kissed Josie&#39;s cheek.  &quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot;  Her hand closed over Josie&#39;s, and their fingers intertwined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.  So, uh, does this mean you&#39;re my girlfriend now?&quot;  Josie grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I thought you were MY girlfriend.&quot;  Cole laughed.<br />
<br />
They kissed again, and then Cole gave Josie all their money before heading to work.  Josie didn&#39;t know a lot about shopping for girl&#39;s clothes, but she definitely wanted to find something cute to wear that wasn&#39;t too expensive.  She found a white embroidered shift dress for 40% off that was idea.  The shop girl suggested she cinch it a bit, and Josie ended up buying a blue chambray shirt to tie around her waist like a belt.  A pair of white canvas flats completed the look, along with a pair of cheap round-lensed sunglasses.  She bought some panties as well, in a few different colors, from an innocent white, to pink, and one red pair that Josie imagined might make her little girl body look sexy.<br />
<br />
Indeed, staring at herself in the dressing room mirror, she wasn&#39;t that impressed.  She was very slender, with a flat tummy, and coltish looking arms and legs.  Puberty had barely begun for her- she had virtually no body hair, and nothing for curves.  Other than a pair of breasts too small to even require a training bra, she was built like a boy.  Oddly, that bothered her, that she looked too much like a child.  How could Cole even bring herself to touch her, when she had a body like this?<br />
<br />
Josie smacked her head against the dressing room wall.  &#39;Ugh, what am I thinking?  I&#39;m a guy, not a silly, lovestruck girl!&#39;  But that wasn&#39;t entirely true, not anymore.  And the thought of Cole kissing her and telling her that she was beautiful made Josie feel warm all over.  She didn&#39;t care about their ages, genders, or what anyone else would say.<br />
<br />
The next chance she got, she was going to sit in Cole&#39;s lap, and hope the taller girl would stroke her hair with strong, gentle fingers...<br />
<br />
She shook herself out of her reverie to find she&#39;d reached down to rub her pussy.  Her little pink nipples were hard, and she desperately wanted to feel her lover&#39;s tongue between her legs.  She got dressed in her new clothes and paid for them.  The shop girl&#39;s compliments made her feel quite good about herself, and she smiled up at her.<br />
<br />
&#39;She has some nice legs, and a great smile.  I&#39;d like to get a closer look at those breasts, too, she&#39;s bigger than Cole.&#39;  Josie thought.  &#39;Ugh...now I&#39;m perving on other girls, what is wrong with me?  I wasn&#39;t this bad as a guy, was I?&#39;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t think so, but Cole had still been at an age where she&#39;d been almost asexual.  So unless Cole had been a nascent nymphomaniac, this was all Josie.  She&#39;d love to ask her old girlfriend about it, but heck, she didn&#39;t even know the girl&#39;s name.  &#39;I hope she&#39;s alright, at least, and ends up with someone who treats her right.&#39;<br />
<br />
Even if she didn&#39;t remember the girl, she still wanted the best for her.<br />
<br />
She sat down to wait for Cole at a bench, very close to the spot where the two of them had met the day before.  As she sat, a tall, very pretty young woman with long chestnut hair sat down next to her.  The other girl seemed just as fit and athletic as Cole, but had wider hips and a bigger chest.  Her hair was like a waterfall running down her back.  The woman smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your name, honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie smiled.  &quot;I&#39;m Josie.  Yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl smiled back.  &quot;I&#39;m Teri.  You look happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie&#39;s feet didn&#39;t quite reach the floor, so she swung them happily as she thought about Cole.  &quot;I am.  I mean, I have some problems, big ones, but they don&#39;t matter as much right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is there someone special in your life?&quot;  Teri was a very curious girl.  &quot;I wish you&#39;d tell me all about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without even thinking about it, Josie told Teri her whole story.  The older girl nodded.  &quot;So tell me what you&#39;d want to change, to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that Cole had to grow up so fast.  She deserves to be young.  I&#39;d miss her grown up body, but she should have the chance to go back to the person she used to be.  Oh and her family must miss her.  I don&#39;t want her to lose people that care about her.  I&#39;m worried about my old girlfriend, too.  I want her to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teri nodded.  &quot;And what about you?  Do you miss being a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still not sure why she was being so open with this girl, Josie just looked her in the eyes.  &quot;Not at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wish everything would work out for you then.&quot;  Teri was happy that her careless wish had turned out as well as it had- she was going to have to spend a lot of time to undo as much of the damage as she&#39;d caused that she could.  She&#39;d already visited the deer-centaur girl earlier.  To her surprise, the teen girl seemed to enjoy her new form, so all Teri had to do was make a few modifications (similar to the ones she&#39;d made to her centaur form, in fact- the girl, April, had seemed to really enjoy having two human vaginas, one up front, and one in back).<br />
<br />
She was surprised when Josie suddenly asked her for one more thing.  The girl was lovely, despite her youthfulness, and Teri was happy to grant her wish, since it was easily granted.  The kiss had been very sweet, and Teri couldn&#39;t wait to get back to her new girlfriend after it.<br />
<br />
Cole was surprised by her supervisor, who had heard how she&#39;d handled the transformed girl, April, and offered her a raise and a bonus.  Cole used some of the money to take Josie out to eat- it was their first date, and it promised to be one of many to come.<br />
<br />
That night they made love to one another until they were both exhausted, and while Cole slept, a strange thing occured- she woke up to find she&#39;d shrunk back to her original form!  She briefly wondered if Josie would reject her, now that she was just a skinny tween, but she was quickly cured of that fear when the blonde kissed her deeply.<br />
<br />
They soon found that Cole could change between her two forms at will.  They decided to call the government hotline, and they were both interviewed, and taken to see a specialist.  Cole&#39;s Mom (well, Josie&#39;s Mom, now) showed up, and cried to find out her little girl was ok (from her perspective, all that had changed was Josie had become a pretty blonde, though according to the doctor, her aging had been greatly slowed as well- Josie&#39;s second adolescence was going to last for quite some time).<br />
<br />
Josie introduced Cole to her Mother as her girlfriend, and to Cole&#39;s surprise, the woman seemed to perfectly accept their love for one another.  In fact, she invited Cole to move in with them, which the girl was happy to do.  She sold her grandparent&#39;s house, and spent about half her time as a kid again.<br />
<br />
The two girls looked like sisters, save for their differing hair and eye colors, and even though Josie still enjoyed her new cute clothing, they both soon shared a passion for skating (and basketball, even though Josie was still too small to play competitively).<br />
<br />
When Josie turned 18 (she still looked like a girl of barely 13), the two got married, and they went off to college together, and neither one of them had any regrets about their new lives.<br />
<br />
Until...</p>
