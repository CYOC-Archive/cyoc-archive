<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allegra was happy to see Flora happy after becoming a Nightengale Animalian. While she may not have been as brightly colored as other Bird Animalians, her voice sound well and Flora was happy. That was more than enough for Allegra and helped reinforce her decision to become a Bird Animalian, and specifically an Owl Animalian. That also made her more than willing to accept Flora not being brightly colored, as owls generally weren&#39;t brightly colored birds, either. And as she did her research, particularly for one that had a more &quot;melodious hoot&quot; as Flora put it ultimately brought her an owl that had its color in its name, the Great Grey Owl. And so, she did her research and eventually Flora came along with her to Horizon when Allegra had finished it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have flying lessons today?&quot; Allegra asked as she got out of the car and looked over its roof to the Nightingale Animalian on the other side and with the lips behind her beak pulled into a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave a call to postpone it,&quot; Flora answered, &quot;and said that we&#39;d come together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure that Owls and Nightingales fly in different ways,&quot; Allegra commented, &quot;as owls are bigger...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the Great Grey is a big owl,&quot; Flora answered with a still wide smile, &quot;but the basic mechanics of flying are probably close enough that we can at least learn the basics together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what on the need for clothing?&quot; Allegra wondered, &quot;you&#39;ve needed new clothes to accommodate your wings and tail feathers. I&#39;d likely need the same, and while I may not get too much bigger... as an Owl Animalian, I probably would be bigger than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d have enough time to get a few things started,&quot; Flora promised, &quot;the full-on wardrobe change can come after that. And you may not need as much with winter coming. You said that the Great Grey Owl doesn&#39;t migrate, it may only move to lower elevation to avoid dealing with deep snow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allegra only rolled her eyes and shut the car door before walking around the vehicle and leading Flora in with her. The two made their way in and Allegra went about the final steps in handling the paperwork that was required to make sure she had some understanding on the basic instincts that she would gain and the potential drive for them. Flora, meanwhile, chatted with the secretary until Allegra finished. From there, the two were led to one of the waiting rooms for Allegra&#39;s conversion. There the two of them sat and quietly waited until Doctor Stein came into view, which got Allegra to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t be too long,&quot; Allegra said to Flora and then moved to follow the Human scientist. &quot;So, you&#39;ve been here since the beginning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;I was part of the original genetics team that Horizon had working on what became the Animalia Virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you never converted yourself?&quot; Allegra wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never had the expressed reason to,&quot; Doctor Stein answered, &quot;neither I nor my wife. Though, because the project has ultimately worked in ways we at Horizon didn&#39;t expect, we&#39;re more than happy to help people gain what they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allegra smiled at that and nodded. She let Doctor Stein open the door and walked in. She sat on the bed that was offered and set about taking her shoes off in expectation of the coming transformation. She&#39;d also need to remover her shirt and bra to accommodate the wings when they grew in, but Allegra wasn&#39;t going to let the doctor see all that. She&#39;d wait for him to leave the room first. While going through with this, Doctor Stein pulled out the plastic box that held the set syringes with Great Grey Owl DNA as part of the Animalia Virus. Once ready, Allegra allowed Doctor Stein to lift sleeve of her shirt to then swab Allegra&#39;s shoulder and then deliver the injections.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein gave a polite smile with the line and then departed the room.<br />
<br />
As the door shut, Allegra was quick to get out of her shirt and bra. Her body was already growing warm and a bit itchy. As she looked down, she could see why. The largely grey feathers with some white speckles were starting grow in. And as time progressed, they grew in thick and grew in quickly. She could look down and see that as her abdominal muscles began to strengthen and fill out to where she could see them growing, they were soon covered under the growing mass of feathers as they came in. She felt her skin tighten under her newly grown feathers as her youth came back, just as Flora got hers back, and she guessed that her hair was also regaining the color she had in her youth. Flora would hopefully like that.<br />
<br />
It left Allegra smiling as she lifted her hands up to watch as her fingernails, carefully manicured, grew pointed and grew longer. In a few moments they&#39;d grown out into a very talon like shape. The sight made her flex both her fingers and then her toes, and the movement in her toes were different from how they normally were. This made Allegra sit forward, even as she felt her breasts begin to regain their youthful firmness and grow in size, to look down to see that her feet had painless changed to fit a more bird-like style foot, and specifically an owl&#39;s foot with the long toes that could grip trees and the long talons to grab prey. It sent a flash of mice going through the back of her mind, but Allegra put that aside. She wasn&#39;t going to go for what Great Grey Owls preferred to eat right now, though she found herself pushing her tongue forward, only to find that her teeth were fusing together to become her new pointed beak. It didn&#39;t hurt, but there was some sense of oddity of it as her lips seemed to pull back and shrink as her teeth fused together and grew out.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOoooooooo!&quot; Allegra found herself calling as her beak finished growing and pressure started to build behind her.<br />
<br />
That pressure forced her to her feet, and she turned her head to look down. She barely noticed the increased range of motion in her neck as she saw her tail feathers come in with the largely grey feathers with dark brown and white stripes on them. However, her tail feathers weren&#39;t the only source of the pressure as that was also building on her upper back. Allegra only watched as that pressure began to push out. They were only small, feathered nubs at first, but they grew and as they grew, the feathers on them grew longer and stronger. It wasn&#39;t long until they had grown into fairly large wings, complete with feathers that wouldn&#39;t make as much noise as the wing beats of other birds. Allegra tested them and flexed as she found and learned to control the muscle groups that had grown in with the wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are nice,&quot; Allegra said to herself, finding her speech slowed a little by her beak. It forced her to us her tongue more to vocalize things since she no longer had the soft lips to help them. But Flora had gone through the same thing when she became a Nightingale Animalian and was doing fine.  &quot;And for the moment, they&#39;ll also balance the new weights on my chest.&quot;</p>
