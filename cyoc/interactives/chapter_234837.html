<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Babified? While Allison was looking over the extensive list of magic, babified was one of the few words that stuck out to her, and yet, it had her interested enough to trying it out. While being diapered excites her, she never actually fully thought out of the idea of being a baby, or rather be babified. After reading it&#39;s contents, she thought it would be something worth trying. She already has a couple days alone for her, and of course she can always take it off and grab another diaper from her limitless Magic Diaper stash under her bed if she thought being a baby was too huge of a leap from just being a diaper lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I want the effect of this diaper to be babified. I want to be treated like a baby, and be able to act and live as a baby, while still holding responsibilities like an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just like her last diaper, it flashed in her hands. And sure enough, when Allison looked back to her hands, she saw the diaper had rather turned a light blue, with the same cartoonish puppy, only now it&#39;s just the face wearing a bib and a pacifier. Allison was a bit reliant towards this diaper, unlike her previous, but she knew on the inside it would be an experience for sure, so right away did she took down her pants and underwear, and taped the diaper on herself. As soon as she strapped herself in, Allison looked at her mirror, seeing herself in her pajama top and her new light blue diaper. &quot;I wonder when it starts to-&quot; Allison abruptly stops, as a form of vertigo hits her harder than she has ever experienced before. While she starts to kneel and bow her head lowly, Allison felt a shift in her clothes and smelt a new smell of baby powder.<br />
<br />
As Allison&#39;s pain started to subdue, she starts to get up, and look at herself through a new mirror, and saw a version of herself that she wouldn&#39;t have looked like, let alone be able to. At the mirror, Allison saw herself, but in a light pink, short-sleeved, small adult-sized baby romper with a black cat imprint, wearing light pink fuzzy thigh-high socks, finger less and somewhat-tight gloves, and a big bonnet, all while sucking on her pink pacifier, with a black pacifier clip connected to her romper instead of her usual pajama fit she just saw herself in not even a minute ago. Allison didn&#39;t even realized she was unintentionally sucking a pacifier. As she takes off one of her gloves and grabs her pacifier out, she starts to comment, in a higher tone than her usual voice, &quot;Wow, I look just like a... babwy.&quot; She starts to touch her new, hair-free bare skin, feeling brand new and baby smooth, and touches her muslin-made romper, having a feeling on her new clothes and even skin. After admiring her new babyish body and looks, Allison starts to look at her new bedroom, which looks like an adult-sized nursery. <br />
<br />
The floor had a giant pink baby mat, along with some toys left around, looking a little messy, and the walls were painted a light pink. The bed she used to sleep on was now, instead, a white twin bed-sided crib, with ceiling-high polls that has a form of an fingerprint lock on the inner and outer sides of the right side of the polls, now at the upper left corner of the room. The mattress in it was hanging pretty low, but also looks quite comfy to sleep on. On the mattress has some stuffed animals, a puffy pillow, and a big black cat paw-printed throw blanket, more than likely big enough to cover her, with a cat-themed mobile installed on top, over the mattress. Where her usual desk is that, is now replaced with a large changing table, with boxes full of diapers under it. In the cabinets of the changing table were lots of diaper wipes, baby powder, and rash cream. When Allison checked out her dresser usually filled with her underwear among other things, she sees different baby products in its&#39; place. Diaper covers, bloomers, baby-like skirts, baby-like shorts, baby-like leggings, some baby-like pants, along with bibs, hats, pacifiers, and pacifier clips. Right next to her seemingly different mirror, is a toy box that is fully closed. Allison takes a look in her closet, and of course she sees nothing but baby-like shirts. baby-like dresses, and baby-like overalls, with the top shelf being filled with other adult-sized baby products. After closing the closet, the last thing she hasn&#39;t noticed, was a corner that has a nice-looking chair and a nightstand, which has a children&#39;s book she doesn&#39;t recognize, a nanny cam in front of her crib, and a charging phone that must be Allison&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Allison walks, or rather waddles, over to the nightstand, and grabs her phone with her only free hand. The phone looks different from her own, with some cute stickers on her phone case, and a new wallpaper and design on her phone screen. She sees one notification, from her &#39;Mama&#39; saying, &quot;I miss you Baby!&quot; A part of Allison just started to blush childishly, thinking about her eternal love with her Mom, but she snaps right back at herself. &quot;Okay, I need to dress myswelf up to play with my toysss,&quot; Allison exclaims, in a childish tone like her previous thought. As soon as she says that, she stops and starts turning red. At first, Allison thought she was using the restroom without her knowledge, but tears starts to swell and form on her rosy cheeks. She starts to cry loudly, before instinctively grabbing her pacifier back and putting it in her mouth. After sucking on her pacifier real hard and fast, her nerves start to cool down, and Allison starts to feel normal. Allison decides to keep on the pacifier, just to not risk acting out like a full baby, but she starts to think to herself as she looks at the closet. &quot;So this diaper must be making me have baby mannerisms, while still giving me adult-like function and tendencies, this is going to be a struggle to try to balance my sides,&quot; was what Allison thought to herself about what just happened to her.<br />
<br />
As she sucks on her pacifier and thinks to herself, Allison looks at what she can wear for the day. Despite being a &#39;Baby,&#39; Allison wants to look somewhat adult-like. So she grabs on clothes that she thinks will look the most grown-up. A white and pink striped shirt and denim overalls. As she takes off her other glove and starts to undress herself, Allison noticed that her breasts are free and are rather erect, for she doesn&#39;t have any bras. Allison also noticed her light blue magical diaper is way thicker and puffier than before, which actually made her quite aroused from the now noticeably better feeling her diaper is on her, compared to her last light purple diaper. In her naked form, wearing nothing but her big diaper, Allison leaves her used clothes on the floor, and starts putting on her shirt and overalls. After putting on her clothes and clipping her shirt with the pacifier clip she was sucking, she starts to instinctively walk over to the dresser, and grabs two long pink nylon strings and hair ties. Looking at the mirror, she starts to tie her hair up to cute pigtails, and tied the nylon strings into cute bows over her head.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself, Allison was looking like a little kid, partly from her overall having a big chest pocket with a pink cat stitch in the middle of it, but mainly from her pigtails,. But when she started to think negatively about her clothes, Allison started chuckling and laughing with her new high pitch, dropping her pacifier out of her mouth and to fall before her clip caught it against her chest. sounding young and naive. &quot;I look so cute, oh if only Mama was here to see me, she would be proud! But I need to get my nom-noms, and then I can go play with my toys!&quot; Allison is being too mentally-consumed by the magic at this moment, but a part of her also doesn&#39;t want to stop this fun the magic is making her enjoy. So she grabs and puts her phone in her main chest pocket on her overalls, puts her pacifier back in her mouth, and away does Allison go, walking downstairs to the kitchen to get her &#39;nom-noms.&#39;</p>
