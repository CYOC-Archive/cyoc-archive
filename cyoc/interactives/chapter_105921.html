<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie’s trip to the jail was uneventful and eerily silent. She never said a single word while be escorted out of the cruiser and made to sit down. Sheriff Cooper uncuffed Julie, but only to secure one end of the handcuffs to the bolted down chair and the other end still secured. Try as she might. Julie could not break the cold rolled steel that comprises of standard police issue cuff. She resigns herself to her fate, yet she still has a desire to get revenge. “I’ll be dammed if I let Eric, Spencer and Frieda get away with this.” Julie thinks to herself. “First those three; then Brian. I’ll get my due on him as well.”<br />
<br />
Julie’s thoughts of revenge were broken when someone enters the police station. Fearing it’s her father, Julie is relieved to see John Shaffer entering the building. “A knight in shining armor?” she thinks. “Perhaps I can use him for my revenge she thinks.” But John doesn’t notice her. Julie sees that Sheriff Cooper greeted him, like a father does a son and both walk into the Sheriff’s office. Another officer comes by and uncuffs Julie from her chair and leads her to be photographed, fingerprinted and be fitted with an ankle monitor.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you came,” the Sheriff states. “But don’t you have work after school?”<br />
“I called my boss to let him know I’ll be late.” John continues, “Told him I needed to see my mother before she is charged, again. He immediately knew what that meant.”<br />
Sheriff pulls out Cathy’s file and fills John in. “You mother is being charged with Driving while intoxicated. Driving while suspend. Grand theft auto,” Sheriff Cooper continues. “And finally, destruction of private property.”<br />
<br />
John is stunned, How could his mother go that far? <br />
<br />
“If only your father where here, son.” The Sheriff laments. “He would set her right.”<br />
“You knew my father?” John asks quizzically.<br />
“Of course John,” Sheriff answers. “Didn’t your mother tell you? Or your aunt for that matter?<br />
“All my mom told me was that dad ran out on me when I was four.” John continues, “My aunt said he was nothing more than a pick.”<br />
<br />
The sheriff shakes his head in disapproval. To deny this kid the truth about a good man was immoral at best. “Well then. Make yourself comfortable John we will be here for a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Your father and I were partners. Back when we were working in the gang taskforce in Seattle. Trying to keep the Triads, Tongs, Bloods and the Crips; for killing each other and everyone else around them.” Sheriff Cooper continues, “ A lot of the times we were working in conjunction with Vice, DEA, and the FBI. Other times we were sitting in a smelly car on steakouts driving each other up the wall.”<br />
“My father was a cop?” John asks.<br />
“Yeah. Dam good one to. He earned lots of commendations and a few medals.” The Sheriff states proudly “Surely you must have seen them.”<br />
“No,” John responds “There is nothing of my dad’s at home. If my father’s stuff exists; It’s either packed away somewhere or thrown out.”<br />
“So she went that far,” Sheriff quietly remarks. “But anyway; getting back to my story. Back when you were still a babe as it were. Your father and I were out assisting on a drug raid for a suspected stash house belonging to the triads. S.W.A.T busts in and it all goes text book. Perps arrested and rooms secured. We proceed to process the scene for evidence while members of S.A.W.T and DEA try to get the Triad members to give up the goods.”<br />
<br />
The sheriff pauses to get some water bottles and give on to John, while drinking the other himself. HE continues, “so we are searching the bedrooms when your father finds a box that we all suspected was the stash. We were looking for heroin by the way.” The Sheriff quickly adds. “Well your father opens the box and BOOM!” both he, the box and a good chunk of the room’s contents are gone.” Sheriff Cooper takes a breath. “The box was a booby trap. The Triads only started placing them in their stash houses. To deter potential rival gangs from stealing their stash; or law enforcement for that matter. I wasn&#39;t in the room with you dad. I was in the next room but heard the explosion.” <br />
<br />
Sheriff gets up and grabs a framed clipping in a book case and hands it to John. John see the clipping. The headline reads. ‘Decorated Officer Slain In Ongoing Gang War’ John puts the clipping down. Tears streaming from him. He grabs the tissue that the Sheriff hands him and blows his nose.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry you had to hear that John. But you had a right to know.” Sheriff Cooper adds, “Your father was a hero. Not some deadbeat you mother and aunt may have told you.” Cooper roots in his desk and pulls out a faded file folder containing various papers. “This is the other thing,” handing the file to John. “Before your father died, he filled out a life insurance policy naming you the sole beneficiary. He also ensured you would benefit from his pension. That and the insurance money are in an escrow account. With compound interest I imagine you will be looking at several million dollars.” Sheriff Cooper continues, “I guess he knew your mother was on a downward spiral. He also named me executor of his estate as it were to further ensure your mother could not get at this tidy nest egg.”<br />
<br />
The sheriff sees Martin finally arriving and gets up. “I was going to hand all this to you when you turned eighteen. But with your mother’s recent action, I felt it necessary you get what is rightfully due to you.” The Sheriff escorts John out and beckons Martin Stovall to come in.<br />
<br />
“Julie’s Processing should nearly be done.” Sheriff Cooper states. Handing Cathy Shaffer’s recent arrest file to Martin, he fills him in.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“So that was Cathy’s son that just left?” Martin puts down the file.<br />
“Yes. I was telling him what his mother did. I also filled him in on his father.” Sheriff continues, “Would you believe his mother and Aunt kept him from knowing what a great man John Sr. was?”<br />
<br />
Martin raises an eyebrow. He knew of Cathy Shaffer’s drunken exploits. Yet knew nothing of John Shaffer Sr. “Perhaps you will tell me about him some other time.” Martin pauses and then speaks up again. “As for Cathy, can we not keep her actions in house?”<br />
“Not this time mayor.” The sheriff say bluntly. “If it was just the usual public intoxication, then yeah. But Cathy stole a vehicle and the officer that arrested her was a state trooper. My hands are tied. Plus with the recent renegade FBI agent poking about; it&#39;s best to let it go this way. Fortunately the state trooper is also a were and Cathy had the good senses to not be in her fursona while being arrested.”<br />
“The act of covering up the dashcam footage would alone expose us,” Martin sighs.<br />
“True on that.” Sheriff continues, I was working on the transfer papers when the school called. I still have to get those done before Cathy is taken to the county lockup in Seattle.”<br />
Martin Stovall gets up. “I’ll let you get on that while I go collect my daughter.”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper nods and gets back to his pile of paperwork.</p>
