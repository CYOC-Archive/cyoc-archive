<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After being transformed into a 12 year-old girl by Darren, Jeff heads up to his room where there is a full length mirror. Before stepping in front of the mirror, Jeff takes a deep breath, he then steps in front of the mirror and his eyes widen and his mouth hangs open when he sees his reflection. “Is… is that really me,” the former boy asks, “I… I am stunningly beautiful! If I were still a guy, I’d be all over her!”<br />
<br />
Even with the dress, which is a bodycon dress, Jeff decides to take a “closer” look at his new body, “it is my body, so I can do what I want with it,” he says to himself, he grins, “I guess I am a little pervert, like my friends always said. BUT any guy would do the same, if transformed into a girl”.<br />
<br />
So, Jeff hurries over to his door and locks it, he then walks to his bed and starts to strip, he takes off his dress, then his panties and, after struggling for a while, removes his bra, then he returns to stand in front of the mirror. His eyes widen, “holy mother of heaven,” he breaths, “I look like a model! I have become the dream of any boy! Man, I hope no boy will start flirting with me, if they do, I just tell them that I am lesbian!”<br />
<br />
Jeff starts to run his hands over his body, he gasps when he realizes how sensitive his skin has become. The former boy blushes as he takes one of his breasts into a hand and gently squeezes it, this causes him to let out a pleasurable moan. Jeff looks over at his bed, a grin appearing on his face, “I think this body needs a much “deeper” and much “thorough” examination,” so, he heads over to his bed, climbs on it and lies down on his back, his legs spread.<br />
<br />
The former boy starts by taking one of his breasts into his left hand and starts to squeeze it gently, he bites his lower lip as he starts to moan. While he is playing with his breast, he moves his right hand slowly over his tummy, down to his pussy. Jeff lets out a loud moan as his fingers brush against his virgin pussy lips. Being a straight boy, Jeff knows exactly what to do to get himself worked up, soon he feels his pussy starting to become moist. Jeff grins, he then slowly inserts a finger, moaning in pleasure as he moves it around inside of him, soon a second finger follows as Jeff pushes the first finger in deeper.<br />
<br />
Jeff starts to move his fingers in and out of his pussy, while continuing to play with his breast, he then feels his fingers touch an obstacle, Jeff assumes that this is his hymn, ‘makes… sense,’ he thinks to himself, ‘after all, I am only a 12 year-old girl, so having still my hymn should not be surprising’. Jeff hesitates, he tries to decide if he should keep it intact or “pop his cheery”, after a while, the former boy shrugs, “to hell… what’s done… is d-done,” he says to himself. Knowing that this will be painful, Jeff takes in a few deep breaths, he then closes his eyes and pushes hard against his hymn.<br />
<br />
The former boy whimpers, feeling the pain become more and more intense the harder he pushes against his hymn, when suddenly and finally he feels his finger “pop his cheery”, Jeff lets out a scream of pain, feeling his fingers become warm as the blood starts to flow out his pussy.<br />
<br />
Jeff starts to slowly thrust his fingers in and out of his bleeding pussy and continues to play with his tit, soon the pain subsides and the feeling of pleasure returns. The former boy continues and soon feels himself coming close to his first female orgasm. Jeff picks up his pace and soon lets out the loudest and most pleasurable sounding moan he ever had as he cumms all over the covers of his bed.<br />
<br />
Jeff pants hard, he feels drained of energy, the “girl” as a happy smile on her face, “f-fuck… th-that was amazing,” she says weakly to herself, “m-much better than as a boy,” she then feels herself drift off to sleep.<br />
<br />
The former boy sleeps all through the rest of the day and night, Jeff only awakens when his alarm goes off. The little “girl” yawns and stretches, she then grabs her phone and her eyes widen, “w-whoa… I can’t believe I slept so long,” she says, “better get myself ready, I got to meet my “dad” in his study in less than half an hour”!<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Zoey” grabs her clothes and hurries into her bathroom, it takes half an hour for her to get ready. Jeff hurries out of his room and down the stairs, the girl stops in front of the study doors and knocks.<br />
<br />
“Come in,” Darren says.<br />
<br />
“Morning, Darren,” Jeff says as he enters.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles at the “girl”, “how did you sleep,” he asks, “and how are you feeling”?<br />
<br />
“I slept great,” Jeff says, smiling, “and I feel fine. It isn’t so bad being a girl”.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “good to hear,” he says, “now, let’s go over a few things, rules and stuff before we need to get going”.<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Zoey” sits down in an arm chair, while Darren sits down in the other, facing the “girl”.<br />
<br />
“Alright then, Zoey,” Darren says, “let’s first put down some rules: first, always stick close to me, don’t wander off by yourself! Second, remember to act like a girl when we are around strangers and third, when we are in our hotel, stay in your room at all times”!<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, “I guess, I am also supposed to call you “dad” or “daddy” when we are out in public?”<br />
<br />
Darren nods, “correct,” he says, “also, if anyone should ask you to leave with them, they should ask me for permission. Don’t worry, I’ll always have a excuse why you can’t go with them”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says, “I trust you Darren. I just hope I won’t be a burden”.<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “you won’t be,” he says, “now, I packed your bag. I transformed a few objects I no longer need into clothes for you, you also have a handbag with some make up and a purse with some cash”.<br />
<br />
“Cool… I think,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “hey, you are a girl now,” he says, “so get used to applying make up and walk around with a handbag. Oh, as for the cash in your purse: you are allowed to spend it”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen, “really,” he asks, “wow, thanks”!<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “even though I kidnapped you,” he says, “I want you to also have a bit of freedom and fun. Now, here are your documents you’ll need to cross the borders, let me do the talking if any questions should arise”.<br />
<br />
Jeff takes the documents, which include his, or rather “Zoey’s” passport and a list of the rules they had just discussed plus a few extra rules.<br />
<br />
“So, do you feel confident that you’ll manage to keep your “act” up and not risk jeopardizing the mission and not risk our lives”?<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I’ll manage it,” he says, “I promise”!<br />
<br />
Darren smiles, “good, then let’s get going,” he says, he then leads Jeff/”Zoey” to the garage and they both get into Darren’s BMW, Jeff sits in the passenger seat, since his new body is tall enough that it’s legal, they then drive to the airport.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the airport, Darren parks his car in the “long term” garage, the two then grab their bags and head for the check in. Once their luggage is checked in, Darren and “Zoey” grab their hand luggage: Darren has backpack in which he has his laptop and some other stuff he might need for the flight. Jeff/”Zoey” has her handbag, which contains her purse, passport, an MP3 player and her “new” phone, which Darren created with the Chronivac, since Jeff’s own phone was to “boy-ish” for a girl. Everything runs smoothly, even at the security, which they pass without any major issues and soon they are both seated on the plane: Darren is sitting on the aisle chair, while Jeff/”Zoey” is sitting next to him by the window.<br />
<br />
By now, Jeff/”Zoey” realized that they were heading to Spain, this caused Jeff to become excited, he had never been to another country, let alone to a foreign country. “I can’t believe I am going to spain,” he says, “I have never been before, I feel so excited”.<br />
<br />
Darren chuckles, “I promise, that, when we have time, I’ll show you around Madrid, I’ve been a couple of times, privately and while on “jobs”,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Zoey” smiles up at her “dad”, “looking forward to it, dad,” she says. “So, how long is the flight going to be,” she then asks.<br />
<br />
“Plus minus seven to eight hours,” Darren says.<br />
<br />
“Zoey’s” eyes widen, “holy crap,” she says, “well, luckily I brought a few things to keep me busy. I wonder if they have any good movies on their system”.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the flight, both “Zoey” and Darren sleep, watch movies, stare out of the window and sleep again.<br />
<br />
Finally, after an eight hour flight, they land at the international Airport “Madrid-Barajas”, and after collecting their bags, they head to the car-rental service and pick up Darren’s rental car, which is a metallic royal-blue Skoda Superb Sportline.<br />
<br />
When they reach their five star hotel in the center of the city and get their keys, Darren turns to “Zoey”, “here are your keys to your room, Room number 203” he says and hands the “girl” the keys, “I’ll be in the room right next to you, which is Room 202. Why don’t you go and take a nap from the long trip? You look tired”.<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Zoey” yawns, “y-yeah… I guess I’ll do that,” she says, the “girl” takes her keys, suitcase, backpack and handbag, then heads for the elevator. Once she enters her room, “Zoey” lets her stuff fall to the ground and simply flops down, face first, onto the bed and soon is fast asleep.</p>
