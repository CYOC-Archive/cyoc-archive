<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at the handsome man handing him the small, black wrist unit.  He took it, the moment feeling almost surreal, like he had gone outside of his body and was watching everything from a distance, unfolding in slow motion.  Their eyes locked, and he felt like he was looking at him for the last time.  He felt something wet roll down his cheeks.  He realized as he put the Chronivac on, he was crying.  He wasn’t sure he could even feel any emotions right now – at least none he could identify.  Just the warm, wet tears dropping from his eyes.  Jeff held his breath in dreadful anticipation, fearing this would be the last moment he would see his boyfriend looking at him the way he did now.<br />
<br />
Then… nothing happened.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Jeff said, cutting his boyfriend off – who was clearly about to ask why Jeff was crying.  Instead they both stood in silence.<br />
<br />
Breathing.<br />
<br />
Waiting.<br />
<br />
And still, nothing happened.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t right,” Jeff muttered to himself, starting to get the feeling he had been made a fool of.<br />
<br />
“I know, sweetie,” Scotty put a hand on his boyfriend’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Both men stood only in their shorts, by the kitchen table, waiting for something to happen.  And nothing was happening.  Lots of nothing.  So much nothing it was deafening.  Scotty gave a sigh and hugged Jeffy tight.<br />
<br />
At a complete loss and confused, Jeffy hugged him back, their chins resting on one another’s broad shoulders.  The two tall, beefy football jocks held one another, their hairy, 18-year-old Greek god bodies a study in perfection.<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand,” Jeff said simply.<br />
<br />
Scotty’s heart broke to see his lover so lost.  He felt so helpless.  But at least now the healing could begin.  Maybe Jeff would finally talk about the secret that had been haunting him, finally open up and share the heavy burden.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt so confused.  Unable to even think any more, he simply stopped trying to figure anything out, and just lost himself in his boyfriend’s strong arms.  He buried his face in Scotty’s shoulder, and all the tension from the last day flooded out in tears on Scotty’s warm skin.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Jeffy,” Scotty soothed, rocking his boyfriend’s body gently, swaying slightly, hot tears stinging his own eyes now.  “Just let it all out, sweetheart.  Let it all out.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sobbed.  He inhaled deeply, his boyfriend’s familiar scent comforting him.  He just wanted to bury himself in his boyfriend’s big, strong, muscular body and stay there in his arms and never come back out.  He felt so small.  And Scotty felt so big, just enveloping his body with his hot, sexy muscles.  Jeff felt his cock getting hard in his shorts, which had a chain reaction on Scotty’s.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at his boyfriend’s handsome face through tears, wiping his eyes with his arm, and saw he was crying too.  “I’m so sorry, Scotty.  I’m such a hot mess… and I think to top it off, I’m hard as hell now.”  They both laughed through their tears, and kissed.<br />
<br />
“I can’t argue with hot.”  Scotty hugged him tighter.  His boyfriend looked so small and fragile to him all of a sudden, and he only wanted to protect him from the pain, from the world, just from everything.  He kissed him again, firmly, and they shed their shorts, cocks pressed between their abs and one another, absently making their way to the living room couch as they kissed and hugged and fondled one another’s big hard bodies.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up to his hot jock boyfriend.  “I don’t know what I did to deserve you.”  He buried his face in the man’s strong, hairy chest, feeling his powerful muscles work under his hot, hairy skin.<br />
<br />
Scotty looked down to his sweet boyfriend.  “I’m the lucky one.  I would be so lost without you.”  They kissed passionately, stubble on stubble, lips pressing lips… nipples tweaking nipples, muscles intertwining in the lover’s dance of passion, beefy hairy bodies massaging against one another as they dropped to the couch in a heavy pile of brutish strength and passionate love.  Sucking, kissing, loving one another, body, soul and spirit.<br />
<br />
Scotty seemed even bigger as they made love, their eyes gazing deeply into one another’s souls as Scotty’s huge, throbbing cock slid up between Jeffy’s parted legs, inviting the Viking god’s shaft deep into himself.  Scotty held his boyfriend protectively, thrusting deeper and deeper into the smaller man, knowing beyond a doubt he would love him forever.  Somehow they felt closer now than they ever had before.   He smiled down at his smaller, fragile boyfriend.  Their eyes locked in loving gazes.  Scotty didn’t even notice when the younger man’s muscles shrank and body changed.  Nor did Jeffy care that he was predominantly straight, as they smiled softly at one another; he simply knew this huge hunk of a man was his boyfriend, and he felt nothing but gratitude to know him.<br />
<br />
They were two souls in love.  As Jeff’s body reverted to his true form, even the color of his eyes changing back to blue, they simply gazed into one another souls as they came together more powerfully than ever before.<br />
<br />
Locked in love.  Simply startled by the beauty of one other.<br />
<br />
“I think it worked,” Jeffy said, feeling so insignificant, his voice so much higher than before.  He couldn’t stop looking at his boyfriend.  Even though the real Jeff had never thought of another man sexually before, he found himself smiling up at the big blonde hairy man, completely content to be with him.<br />
<br />
“I know… it worked,” Scotty smiled down at his small, brown-haired boyfriend, never realizing how beautiful a smaller man could be… until that moment, gazing into the soul within, knowing this was the man he loved more deeply than life.  He felt so peaceful.  “I’m so sorry I doubted you, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
All the worries, all the fears and prejudices humankind were so fraught with... too tall, too short, too this or too that… what did it all really matter in the end?<br />
<br />
All the two lovers knew as they embraced one another in their new perfect moment, their souls laid bare to one another and their hearts beating as one... was gratitude to be resting in one another&#39;s arms.  Love found a way.</p>
