<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Suzy walked on the sidewalk, she was fiddling with the dials on the Wish ray.  She found all sorts of settings that could change anything that she could think of.  It had been originally set to Target's Desire but when she had changed it to Shooter's Desire all sorts of options had opened up.  Some of the words were naughty, like she'd used on Justin, and she looked forward to trying them out.<br />
<br />
Looking up she realized that she was standing in front of Tiffany's house.  Suzy wondered if Amanda, Tiff's mom was home, and decided to check it out.  Suzy knocked on the door, causing it to shake from the blows, and it was opened by Janice, Tiff's older sister who was taking a year off before she went to college for degree in veterinary science.  When she got a good look at Justin she gasped in fright and looked like she was going to bolt when she felt someone grab her hand.  Looking down she saw a strange little girl with green hair and eyes holding tightly to her wrist, &quot;Excuse me miss, but is Mrs. Calleur home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice stared at the sweet girl's expression and realized that this must be some kind of joke.  That's right, that dog-man isn't even real, Janice thought to herself.  She was just spending to much time in her books.  Looking closer at the man she realized that other then his costume he didn't have any cloths on.  Before her mind could dwell on that further, she looked at the ground.  She began to blush and glanced at the girl again before looking back at the ground, &quot;Umm...yeah, she's here.  I'll just go get her.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Suzy released her hold on Janice's wrist, the girl practically bolted up the stairs.  Looking around, Suzy decided that she didn't want to wait outside and led Justin into the living room, closing the door behind her and fusing it shut with her green energy.  Looking up the stairs she saw Amanda coming down the stairs in a pair of jeans and an old t-shirt.  Amanda's hair had gone grey when she was 25 and she had gained some weight since her marriage 23 years ago.  Suzy had thought it was unfair that Suzy, who had been 2 years older then Amanda, had always looked younger then Amanda.  <br />
<br />
Amanda looked was a little wary, thinking Janice was pulling her leg with the odd people that had appeared at her door.  She saw that the door was closed and was about to open it to see the strangers when a sweet voice stopped her, &quot;Hi Amanda.&quot;  Amanda turned and saw the girl and man that Janice had warned her about.  Amanda had to admit that the man really did look like a unholy combination of German Shepard and Man.  She had to agree with Janice that it just couldn't be real.  Looking at the girl, Amanda wondered where she had seen her, &quot;Yes, and you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me, Suzy. I know it's hard to believe but Tiffany and Katie found this ray gun that can transform people in all sorts of ways.  It's really cool.&quot; Suzy's words rushed out and then dragged out on the last word, like a kid who has just discovered something awesome and can't wait to share it with others.  Amanda just stared and tried to slow down the girl's words enough to understand and what she was getting just wasn't making any sense, &quot;What?&quot;  Suzy repeated herself, this time slower as if Amanda were some sort of moron before giving a shrug.  Suzy didn't understand, Amanda should be happy about this.   &quot;I don't want to sound rude but I don't believe you.&quot; Amanda said and was uncomfortable when the little girl looked like she was about to cry.  Trying to cheer her up she gave the girl a hug.  &quot;Maybe if you showed me something...&quot; at those last words little Suzy broke away from her hug and was excited again.  &quot;I know, I'll show you the ray, I think I got it figured out enough.  Watch this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda looked at the Dog-man, thinking he would take off his mask and tell her she was part of some joke but the dog didn't move.  Uncomfortable, Amanda looked back at Suzy and saw her pull out a blue ray gun.  It looked like a cheap toy that could be bought at the dollar store but then Suzy pulled the trigger and a blue ray came out and surrounded her body.  Amanda had to admit that it was an amazing visual effect but they should leave her house when the girl began scratching her arms.  &quot;I guess this time it's going to be a little itchy.&quot;  Before Amanda's eyes the seven year old girl began to grow into twenty three year old woman. Her body began developing as her breasts appeared and swelled till they were a full C cup.  Her once baggy shirt now strained against the pressure until the ray changed it into a black leather jacket with green racing stripes going down the arms.  It opened up to reveal her cleavage and a dark green fur lining appeared.  Her face matured as her lips became full and light makeup appeared on her face to accentuate her eyes.  Her pants became skin tight and her sneakers became green high heels that added several inches to her height.<br />
<br />
Amanda stared, because despite the change in hair and eye color, she recognized the woman before her.  Amanda had never seen Suzy in anything so daring but, even so much younger, Amanda recognized that face.  &quot;What happened Suzy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy took a good look at herself and liked what she was seeing.  &quot;I already told you all that.  No, you should be more interested in the why, Amanda.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Why what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why I'm here, of course.  You see, Katie and Tiff already played with this toy and have had quite the adventure.  They're sleeping it off as we speak but I thought we could have some fun too.  After all, it can all get just so boring.  Doing the same thing day in and day out.  It's always a good try out new things don't you think?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to me?&quot;  Amanda asked, her eyes wide and she started to back a way but Justin suddenly moved and grabbed her by the arm.  Terrified, Amanda screamed as Justin threw her in front of Suzy. &quot;Now don't be that way, I've already used my power to soundproof the house and locked Janice in her room.  She can come down later if everything goes well.  You see Amanda, I just want to test out the wish-ray on you.  Just a couple settings to see if I know what I'm doing and then, when I'm satisfied, I'll turn you back to normal and we can go our separate ways.  Or you can come with me.  The decision will be completely up to you.  Till then, you'll be all mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy pulled the Wish-ray from an inside pocket on jacket and flipped the dial to one of the settings she had created.  Suzy shot Amanda and was saw Amanda's eyes close tightly, as if she was in a lot of pain before going limp.  Suzy twisted the dial to another setting before handing the Wish-ray to Justin.  &quot;Justin, I don't want you to do anything but stand here.  No matter what happens and when I tell you to, I want you to shoot her with that.  Not a moment before or else I'll be very cross with you.  Will you do it?&quot;  Justin cocked his head to the side before nodding at her.  &quot;There's a good boy.  If you do this right I promise you a treat.&quot;  Suzy petted Justin on the arm and Justin smiled and let his tongue out.  Suzy knew he would do the right thing and then went over to Amanda's prone body.  Suzy gave Amanda a little shove and Amanda let out a groan.  &quot;Oh, my head...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda got up to a kneeling position before staggering up to her feet.  She leaned against a wall, trying to get her bearings.  She had been talking to Suzy and then been shot by some weird ray.  &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would spoil the surprise.  This is your first time though, so the change will probably be gradual.  Oh it's starting.&quot;  Amanda didn't look at herself to see what was happening.  Instead the same thought began repeating in her head, until it threatened to split her head right open.<br />
<br />
Suzy shot me.  Suzy Shot me.  Suzy Shot Me.  Suzy Shot ME!  <br />
<br />
SUZY SHOT ME!!<br />
<br />
Amanda was going to make Suzy pay for that.</p>
