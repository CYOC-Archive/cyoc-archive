<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen spread his cheeks and slid the thick, long, hard, black, latex toy up his ass. It slid up his ass thanks to his wet anus juices. It went up to the base and Stephen felt the warm balls in between his cheeks. The photographer was getting horny over this he could tell. Sweat and drool was cascading down his forehead and lip. Stephen did different poses with the toy. After a few more shots the photographer turned on the vibrator. <br />
&quot; You can make some moans if you want to. And we will turn it on High soon, so be ready.&quot;<br />
The vibrator was making his insides jiggle, it poured pure fiery pleasure and he let out small gasps and yelps barely loud enough to be heard. <br />
When the photographer kicked it into high, the base were the balls were grew warm, almost hot, the vibrations became more forceful and frequent, waves and waves of power came from his anus. He barely could pose with it inside him. Finally he was done. The photographer told him he could take it out as he turned it off. He even let him keep it. He thanked the photographer and went into the other room to shower. <br />
He was covered in sweat and his juices. Antonio came in the shower with him. He pulled down his thong and started playing with his dick. They spoke in Spanish.<br />
&quot; You did really well out there&quot; Antonio complemented.<br />
&quot; You really think so? I&#39;ve never done anything like that I didn&#39;t even know what a vibrator was. I Had never seen one in Mexico. &quot;<br />
&quot; We have lot&#39;s of cool stuff in the US.&quot; He said as he started to alternate from jacking him off to blowing him. <br />
&quot; You should shave before you go to school. &quot;Antonio said after taking a long suck.<br />
&quot;But I just did yesterday.&quot; He said feeling his face for any growth.<br />
&quot; Not up there, down here. He said pointing to his pubes.&quot;<br />
&quot; Are you sure? I mean we never really shaved it in Mexico.&quot;<br />
&quot; I shave mine, and you should to your in America now. Here use this razor.&quot;<br />
Even though Antonio offered it to Carlos( Stephen seems to fade into memory now ) Antonio was to one who shaved him. <br />
Soon no hair was left as Carlos felt the smooth ness around his junk. Antonio then shaved his legs and under his arms. After both of them lathered up each other in soap Antonio finished the blow job and ate all his cum. Both boys walked out of the shower and got ready for school. <br />
As they drove to school they picked up two other Hispanic boys. They finally arrived and walked to there classes. Luckily Antonio was in all his classes and walked him around. But it was not a good day for non white Americans especially Hispanic people. Many of the other white boys shouted that both of them should&quot; go home &quot;and they shouted &quot; Build that wall! Build that wall!&quot; <br />
Carlos asked what was going on. Antonio explained that the soon to be president who had just gotten elected had distain for hispanic people especially those who weren&#39;t born here. They made it to there first class; Math. Carlos had barely studied stuff in Mexico but he understood some of the equations and quadratic polynominals. Antonio almost seemed surprised thag he could contemplate The problems. Next was PE. <br />
The boys were both told that Today was physical Fitness testing day. Antonio and Carlos both succeeded. They were both thin yet strong light weight healthy teenagers. They exceeded in running and flexibility but lacked some what in tasks souly devoted to strength. After the testing the boys had to go in and shower. Carlos stripped and turned on his shower as other people came in, the white boys started to giggle and made quick glances. He tried to say something to them in broken English that only made them Laugh harder. One red headed boy named James even said &quot; ........Mexico will pay for it.&quot; They other white Boys laughed. Carlos got out from under the shower and dried off. Antonio came in after him and they both got dressed and headed to there next class. <br />
&quot; Antonio why were they laughing at me?&quot; <br />
&quot;Carlos some people in America just don&#39;t like people that aren&#39;t like them. I assume they made fun of you becuase you are uncut and that you are shaved. They think your gay.<br />
&quot; But that&#39;s not my fault and plus now that I think about that hair was really disgusting i feel fresher without it. And who cares if they think I&#39;m gay.&quot;<br />
&quot; well it Dosent matter Carlos we will just be different and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.&quot;<br />
&quot; Or is there Carlos thought&quot;</p>
