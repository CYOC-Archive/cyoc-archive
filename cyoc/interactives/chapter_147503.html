<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reham watched in nervously morbid fascination as the Master went to work. He grabbed the man’s bottle and deftly popped the cork. Master’s giant hand tipped the bottle over and the tiny man tumbled out onto the wooden coffee table. He quickly and nimbly stood, barely an inch tall, and looked around before staring directly at Reham. She caught his tiny gaze, their eyes met, and she gulped as she saw him comprehend.<br />
<br />
She might as well have said, this is going to be you. Instead she began to tear up at her subservient helplessness. The tiny man seemed to see everything she was thinking. He offered her a weak smile and she could just make out him mouthing something... a moment before Master’s giant finger slammed down on top of the tiny man’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
The shrunken man fought back suddenly, pushing back at the giant finger pressing him down, and fell to his knees in agony as he tried with all his might to prevent being crushed. Every ounce of his tiny muscles fighting for survival.<br />
<br />
Reham put her furry hands over her mouth and watched in horror as the little man grunted and began to buckle.<br />
<br />
“Let me introduce you to Kris.” Master chuckled. “He’s a gay man in his 30’s. Flamboyant. Feminine. He went home with me last night, like the easy fag he is.”<br />
<br />
The camel woman bristled with anger, the fur of her neck rippling, but fought. She had to do something... she had to... her tongue licked the back of her bucked front teeth. She could bite, they were sharp.<br />
<br />
If she could save these people, her own death would be worth it. She tensed her body and began to breathe heavily.<br />
<br />
Master suddenly let up his finger. Kris fell exhausted to all fours and looked up pitifully, knowing his fate was sealed. He said nothing, he simply stared at Master waiting.<br />
<br />
“What a pathetic male.” Master boomed. “What a disgusting creature. Don’t worry, you’ll probably get off on what I’m about to do to you. It’ll make you feel... pride.”<br />
<br />
Kris stared resentfully and sneered.<br />
<br />
“I wish for your body to turn into a full flamingo. Slowly. Painfully. Every change will be a new nightmare.”<br />
<br />
Kris seemed to reel in shock as the wish sealed itself into his being, and let out a tiny terrified scream as he grabbed himself in agony. All over, his tiny body began to grow red and irritated.<br />
<br />
Reham simply watched in terror until Master rose and picked her up by the waist to set her down on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
“And you, Reham, I wish for you to shrink down to their scale and lose your half animal state. Back on all fours, my little camel! I wish for it to hurt like hell.”<br />
<br />
Reham shot a panicked glance to Kris just in time to see a million razor sharp needles begin to erupt from his burning skin. He screamed in pure unbridled pain as they forced their way out of his skin and began to grow, each fraction of the emerging feathers pushing and ripping their way out of him.<br />
<br />
Reham, meanwhile, fell to her knees as pain returned. She was already shrinking again as her body was wracked with incredible discomfort. She felt her guts twisting, her thighs swelling. Every diminishing inch of her felt nothing but tight gripping pain. She, too, cried out from the assault on her nerves, and together the two helpless changers began to scream and cry in pure concentrated torture.<br />
<br />
Master sat back, his erection throbbing as Reham fell to all fours and her human voice began to fade to the chuffing groan of a camel once more. Erik, meanwhile, now covered in fluffy pink feathers, began to gag and suffocate as his throat pulled and his neck began to lengthen. His tiny screams started to sound ungodly and inhuman as his face began to warp and crunch into a flamingo’s hooked beak.<br />
<br />
As the two writhed and changed, Erik let out a mournful sustained honk as his human voice faded away. At the same time, perched on his hands, he fell forward and collapsed as his torso began to shrink, his ass deflated, and his fingers and hands began to merge into his new wings. He pushed himself backwards awkwardly, falling on his shrinking and skinny legs, and gasped deeply as he began to lose his humanity. Managing to open to beady yellow eyes, the poor changing human saw the state of his body and let out a panicked incomprehensible string of honks and rasps, managing to crawl through the pain to lurch forward and beg Master to stop.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Reham was crunching and rounding, her animal size returning as she barrelled and swelled into a full quadruped.<br />
<br />
Erik continued his heartbreaking pleading, honking desperately as now he shrank to proper scale, seeking to be throbbing and painfully contracting as he crunched and compacted into a full bird.<br />
<br />
His wings outstretched, he let out a final terrified rasp and arched his long neck back as his joints snapped, his bones crackled, and he completely became a flamingo bird.<br />
<br />
At the same time, unable to stand, still completing her slow growth, Reham weakly held out a trembling front leg towards Erik and began to drag her bulk close to him. She winced as her jumps began to rise and gasped as she desperately crawled towards him, fighting for every movement against the blinding pain.<br />
<br />
She reached him as she approached her full size, nearly three times as big as the poor shocked bird, and pulled herself around him, lying next to him and cuddling close.<br />
<br />
Together, the two jerked at the completion of their awful transformations into animals and began to sob into each other, the joint experience overwhelming them emotionally.<br />
<br />
Master’s movements caught Reham’s vision. She held the sobbing and honking Erik between her front legs and let out an angry deep bray against her master just as she saw him release his giant cock over top of them and began to jerk odd above.<br />
<br />
Reham’s eyes widened in abject terror, the sexually reserved Muslim staring in disgusted shock. She put her hoof on Erik’s plush feathers and covered him, lowering her face and thick neck into the flamingo’s wet face and waited for the inevitable.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long. Master grunted above and Reham winced with tears in her eyes as the feel of burning jizz splattering all over them made itself known. At their current size, Erik reduced to mere milimeters in his bird body and Reham barely more than two inches tall, the volume was enough to completely saturate them both in thick gooey spunk.<br />
<br />
Gasping, choking, Reham looked to Erik and found her flamingo friend absolutely mortified below, curled up in a puddle of a man’s semen.<br />
<br />
Wet, sticky, fur and feathers clumped and oozing, they clutched each other closer, Erik putting his wings around the camel’s neck and clinging to her closely.<br />
<br />
Reham wanted to say she wouldn’t let anything happen to her poor new friend, but she no longer had words.<br />
<br />
Helpless, tiny, covered in cooling jizz, the two mortified creatures watched in terror as the Master’s giant hands separated them from each other’s embrace and casually put them into their own jars, two metal lids clamping down and shutting above each.<br />
<br />
Erik, beak agape, panting, stared through his glass prison to Reham. The Camel laid down sadly and stared at her new friend with mournful resentment and humiliation. The flamingo managed to shoot a hateful expression to the master and Reham nodded gently.<br />
<br />
Then their stares went to the two remaining women and realization set in - this wasn’t over.</p>
