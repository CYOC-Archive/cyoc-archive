<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jeff was walking around school looking for someone to change, he spotted Eddie Walker in the hall. Eddie was the smartest kid in school and was quite proud of his intelligence, maybe a little too proud sometimes. Perhaps he was compensating for his less-than-impressive body. Eddie was a decent 5&#39;6, but his body was less than decent or desirable. Skinny with the beginnings of a gut, probably a sign of uglier developments as he got older. You could tell that his body bothered him as well with the look of envy he gave to the jocks when he thought no one was looking. Heh, with all those feelings of pride, envy, and desire, Eddie was a perfect candidate for a change.<br />
<br />
Jeff discretely pulled out the Chronivac and typed in some changes. Well, Eddie, you always wanted a body like the jocks, but are you willing to sacrifice your pride for it?<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Eddie, unaware of Jeff&#39;s changes, was in the middle of putting away things in his locker when he suddenly felt warm. Did someone turn on the heater? He looked around to see that no one else seemed bothered by a sudden heat wave, so it must have been just him feeling suddenly tepid. It was long before the heat Eddie felt became sweltering. Clearly, something was wrong, so he booked it to the nearby men&#39;s bathroom. Jeff decided to lock the door to the bathroom with the Chronivac just to give Eddie a bit of privacy for his transformation...<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; Eddie asked himself as he splashed water on his face in a vain attempt to cool himself down, as despite the freezing water, his skin was still burning. &quot;Am I getting sick? No, what kind of illness did this all of a sudden? Wait, could this be that spontaneous combustion thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eddie, being a man of logic, normally didn&#39;t believe in things like that, but as his temperature kept rising, he wondered if there was even a logical explanation for this? Soon, the heat was becoming unbearable, and it was then that Eddie noticed something else happening. His arm looked swollen... no, it was... buff? Before he could even process this, muscles started to rapidly pile on his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;The hell?!&quot; That was all Eddie could say as he took a step back out of shock. Unfortunately for him, his changing weight and center of gravity caused him to fall over leaving him writhing on the ground as his body grew. It was a painful experience for Eddie as his body stretched and inflated. He could hear and feel the clothes ripping from his growing frame. He could feel his body taking up more space and becoming heavier. A feeling that he would have relished if he wasn&#39;t scared out of his mind. Just as quick as it started, the growth finally stopped, and the heat Eddie felt dissipated leaving the confused teen on the floor, gasping for breath, trying to figure out what just happened. He was still sweating from the sudden growth, and his clothes were clinging to his body, thanks to that. Wait a minute, Eddie swore his clothes ripped off of him, how was he still wearing clothes.<br />
<br />
Guess it was time to see what exactly happened to him, so Eddie slowly got up, his eyes shut since he was a bit scared to see what he had become. What if he ended up with green skin like the Hulk, or ended up deformed. He had to open his eyes eventually, however, so he slowly opened one eye to peak, and then both his eyes went wide at the sight of what he became. He was ripped! Massive even. He looked like one of the football players he so envied. Just wait till they see him now! The teen eagerly touched his pecs to feel that they were solid slabs of muscle. He touched his bicep, and it felt like small boulders. His abs, a perfect set of six! Before, he could only dream of having abs, and now he had a six-pack! There was one more thing Eddie wanted to check, so he reached down and gave his butt a firm grope. Mmmm, it was so large and firm. Yeah, that was going to be useful later. But his muscles weren&#39;t the only thing that changed about him. He was taller now, at least above 6 feet. And these new clothes might be a bit too revealing for school, but the way they showed off his body was just chef&#39;s kiss. Even his face looked better. Heh, look out school, there was a new hunk in town.<br />
<br />
Eddie couldn&#39;t believe it. He was given the body of his dreams! Honestly, he was still half expecting to find this was all a dream and wake up, but this wasn&#39;t a dream. This was reality! Eddie couldn&#39;t wait to show the jocks the new him and impress the rest of the school while he was at it. The former nerd was about to perform some experimental flexes when he soon found that his dream body came at a price. <br />
<br />
It started with his head feeling fuzzy. Eddie initially wrote it off as vertigo due to his new height, but then he forgot what vertigo even meant! Soon, Eddie realize that he was forgetting all sorts of things. Hours of studying flowed out of his brain like water rushing to the ocean. It was so hard to think of complex thoughts now. The smartest and nerdiest kid in school was truly gone now.<br />
<br />
&quot;My- My brain! What happened to my Brain!&quot; Eddie screamed. He was so dumb now. He couldn&#39;t believe that he gained his dream body but lost his intelli- intelli... Smarts he was so proud of. He had to rever... he had to change back! He didn&#39;t know how but surely there was something he could do.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled as he watched the new Eddie scramble out of the bathroom and wondered what he should do next with the Chronivac.</p>
