<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some time had passed, with the two just kissing, and Amy stroking Mark&#39;s dick like a pet. Mark wanted to continue the fun but another feeling dictated that he had to wait. He also took a glance at his alarm and the time displayed furthered his decision.<br />
&quot;Amy, I don&#39;t know how you feel, but I am getting hungry. So I am going to go and make some food, and you are of course, welcome to join.<br />
Amy just nodded to this, then took a look at the alarm clock, itself. When it saw that the time was a quarter past six it got reminded of something important. It rushed to the computer and wrote &quot;Parents?&quot; Mark took a gander at the text.<br />
&quot;Oh right, you weren&#39;t there to hear it, but my parents left on that cruise they had been planning for, for like an eternity. Left yesterday afternoon.&quot; Mark replied. Amy remembered that Mark&#39;s parents had been talking about it a lot in recent times. So they had finally gotten to do it. &quot;Back when?&quot; the latex creature then asked through text.<br />
&quot;They will be back home Sunday in four weeks.&quot; replied Mark as he finished putting on his pants and shirt. Amy walked behind him and leaned over, pressing its gigantic tits up against the mans back, and typed over his shoulder: &quot;So what you are saying is that we have a month alone to have fun?&quot; Amy licked its lips. It liked the situation it had arrived in. Though it did need a plan for when his parents came home. But it had four weeks to think of something, and it could probably figure something out by then. If not, maybe the magic shop could help. &quot;The store must have something to help me staying like this and not turn heads.&quot; Amy thought to itself. But it could deal with that later.<br />
&quot;Amy, you listening?&quot; The doll returned from its own thoughts. It shook its head in shame. &quot;I said that I still have to go to school, and I might plan on meeting with friends and crap, so I won&#39;t be here the whole time.&quot; The doll responded by bouncing its palm on its forehead, as to convey that it understood that. &quot;Though that would still leave plenty of time for us to have fun.&quot; Mark finished, as he made a confident smirk and left his room. Amy was happy by his response. It was thinking about all they would do for the next month of time. All the new shapes it would gain. All the experimentation that they would do, and of course, all of that glorious, mind-numbingly awesome sex to be had. With a smile plastered on its face it wrote something on some paper, took it and the pen, then left the room and reshaped its body as it went to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, Mark had pulled out some meat and greens that had to be made first. As he looked for a pan he heard the sound of Amy&#39;s tip feet enter the room. He turned around to see her in her fetishized latex fuck-doll form sexily swaying towards him. Before he could say something she handed him a piece of paper. &quot;Before you ask, I look like this so you may start thinking of me as a thing and not a human. So don&#39;t expect to see a lot of a face on me at any point. Also, let me do the cooking, as a way to thank you for letting me stay, and to do all this crazy stuff with me.&quot; He looked at the doll and then at the kitchen equipment and ingredients. <br />
&quot;Uhm, will it be fine? Can you taste or even smell what you would be cooking?&quot; The doll made a motion as if she was laughing silently, then took the paper and wrote with the pen she had, and handed the paper back over. &quot;If I need help, I will wave you.&quot; Mark sighed in defeat.<br />
&quot;I will still keep an eye on you and your cooking. Just to be safe.&quot; Amy gave a thumbs up and took a look at what Mark had already taken out. Mark saw Amy glancing across the ingredients and then told her what he was thinking of making. He then went into the living room and turned on the TV to let it run telling the two about all kinds of relatively boring news before a documentary of some sort started playing, while Mark double checked practically everything Amy did. Not because he thought she would do bad, but he just wanted to make sure. Neither of them knew how the differences of Amy&#39;s new body would affect things. In the end, Amy didn&#39;t need any help as she served Mark his dinner.<br />
<br />
The doll looked at Mark eating, feeling a bit jealous. It hadn&#39;t been all that long, and it already was missing its ability to eat. Or at least, eat normal foods. It was looking forward to when Mark was going to feed it again. &quot;What happens to the sperm that I absorb.&quot; it thought to itself, hoping that maybe the magic manual would beam the answer into her. But nothing. &quot;What is the lube that my fuckholes generate?&quot; it then thought to itself, but as with the first question, no answer came. &quot;Did I need to ask the questions out loud?&quot; it finally thought, and was met with more silence. The doll took it as a &#39;yes&#39;. <br />
It then turned its attention to the TV, and how the program talked about how people of the middle ages interpreted different things, such as powerful weather and the occasional fossil they would stumble upon. Pictures of angels, dragons, unicorns and mermaids appeared on the screen and gave the latex girl some ideas. &quot;With parts from costumes, that may be possible.&quot; it thought to itself, as the different pictures of unicorns appeared. &quot;Well, maybe that requires more experimentation.&quot; As if it responded, a dragon picture was shown. &quot;That would take ages if we could figure out how.&quot; But Amy was happy. It could easily see how it could become a latex angel or a mermaid. Maybe getting some stuff and going latex cat girl. &quot;Latex catgirl mermaid angel.&quot; The doll imagined itself smiling. &quot;I will never go back to being a human again, even if I got the chance. These powers are too good.&quot;<br />
It heard cutlery hitting the plate, and saw that Mark was done eating. &quot;Now we can return for some fun.&quot; it thought as it imagined all of the things it could become.</p>
