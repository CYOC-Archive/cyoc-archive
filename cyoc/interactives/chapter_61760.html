<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle looked at John and tried to hide himself getting hard, but was impossible to hide his own new 10-inch member in the new speedo he wore.  He flushed red with humiliation in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
Loki looked at Kyle with mock sympathy and a wicked gleam in his eyes. &quot;Oh Kyle, secretly gay for John!&quot; He realized aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am gay for John,&quot; Kyle said helplessly, unable to lie.  He flushed even more, covering his mouth in shock with one hand, and weakly trying to cover his huge member with the other.<br />
<br />
Loki laughed with amusement.  &quot;It's ok Kyle, being gay is no big deal today.  It's your turn to wish now - the first thing that pops into your heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked horrified, but he couldn't stop himself any more than John could now.  &quot;I wish John's name was Kian, and that he was a hot gay surfer who could never wear more than a hot pink speedo and jewelry and who was a total bimbo and I wish we were boyfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can grant you most of your wish,&quot; Loki chuckled, &quot;but John - I mean Kian - won't be gay, he will be bisexual and won't be able to say no to anyone.&quot;  With that, John for got ever being called John, and immediately knew his name had always been Kian.  He felt his sense of self - his sense of male identity, masculinity, and security evaporate like rubbing alcohol, and a hunger grew inside him... soon becoming a deep need... a need for validation - from anyone...  It went from a need to a deep seated addiction for attention.  He would do anything for anybody just to get some attention now, especially if that anything was sexual in nature.  The longing became an ache that filled him until his body screamed to be touched.  &quot;Oh Fuck,&quot; he moaned, suddenly feeling like a lost little boy needing someone to take his hand and guide him.... but quickly learning to cover that insecurity up with knowledge of flirting and feigning interest in others so that they would give him attention.  A tribal band tat appeared around his right bicep, the tie, collar, cuffs and vest disappeared, only a now hot-pink speedo covering him - barely.  His hair lengthened to a shaggy long mane and lighted to a sun-bleached surfer blonde, his eyes became bright aqua, his teeth a perfect white smile, his already hot body became slightly more lean and his skin darkened to a bronze, sun-kissed tan.  A hemp necklace appeared around his neck, as well as a bracelet and ankle bracelet.  His mind filled with knowledge of skateboarding and surfing, memories of growing up in Southern California, surfing nearly every day since childhood, and traveling to all best surf spots in Africa, Australia, and around the globe.  &quot;Whoa&quot; he gasped at the rush of new memories, his voice sounding higher and softer, with a definite SoCal surfer boi accent.<br />
<br />
Kian stood momentarily overwhelmed by it all... having his mental furniture rearranged was leaving him hard pressed to keep up with it all.  He tried to remember his old self and all that just happened, failed, then immediately started trying to figure out who to flirt with first to try to fill the gaping hole inside his soul.  He could try to go in to work at the insurance agency on Monday, but he would find that his services as a stripping surfer would fit much better with the gay strip bar a few blocks over.<br />
<br />
And even Kian he was changing, so was Kyle.  His skin also darkened to a rich tan, his clothing disappearing, save for a bright yellow thong.  His hair shagged out and grew down his back, as his body hair receded and muscles bulged even more.  A hemp choker and shell ankle bracelet adorned him, gold hoop earrings appearing in his ears.  His now green eyes widened at the sensation of new memories replacing his old memories of being a stock trader and realtor.  He wouldn't be making any big bucks on Wall Street any more.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the marriage celebration transformed - after all a himbo like Kian could never get married to anyone and remain faithful to them, the best he would be now is a sex toy to all those around him.  It was now a wild beach party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but I got ahead of myself, my dear,&quot; Loki said to the ex-bride, as family members started disappearing to be replaced with hot beach bunnies.  &quot;I promised you a wish. So now for your turn,&quot; Loki winked at her playfully, she just glared back at him and then at her ex-groom and ex-best man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't fucking believe you have done this to me you fucking cocksucking dickheads! All you fucking care about are sticking your fucking penises into fucking holes - you're so fucking dumb, I... I wish you were both really as fucking dumb as you made me feel today on what was supposed to be the happiest fucking day of my fucking life!  You only think with your dicks anyway so I don't even have to wish it to humiliate you, you fucking fuckers!&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly both Kyle's and Kian's jaws went slack, their eyes became completely abysmally vacant, and they said a very Keanu-esque &quot;Whoa&quot; in unison.  Then a moment later, big dumb goofy grins crossed their faces as they groped each other right in front of the remaining wedding guests (who were still rapidly disappearing) and wild beach bunnies.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yaaa...&quot;<br />
<br />
Their thoughts poured out of their heads as their libidos and cock sizes dwarfed their fastly shrinking IQs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... Kian feels... good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yaaa dude... Kyle feels good too.&quot;<br />
<br />
They wouldn't be saying any big words any more, their brains fogging up and slowing down permanently.  Their speech came slow, and now math and even reading anything beyond a child's level would be completely foreign to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Kian said with giddy triumph in his voice, as if he just came up with a way to solve a particularly difficult physics problem, &quot;Let's fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yaaa!&quot; Kyle said dumbly, his head bobbing up and down happily, &quot;Kyle and Kian fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
They ripped each others thongs off, releasing their massive trouser snakes to swing free in the warm tropical breeze, laughing happily, unable to keep their hands off of one another, two dumb cocksucking gay surfer bois forever lost in lust.</p>
