<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris’s heart was pounding in his chest and he was breathing heavily, he was hot and felt on the edge of throwing up.<br />
“It’s alright.” reassured the bunny nurse as she placed a reassuring hand on his hand. “I know it is scary, but it will all be over soon.”<br />
Chris looked up at the large mirror, which was located above the bed, at first he wondered why in the world would they put a mirror above the bed. He heard a snap and a pop coming from within him, like bones popping, he turned his attention back to the mirror trying not to take note of the sounds coming from within him and how everything felt so weird. He was focused on the mirror when the doctor called out that 5 minutes had passed, it felt like it had been hours yet so far there had been no changes whatsoever. He was just thinking that maybe there was some kind of mistake and he didn’t have the monster flu and that he could go back to his normal life, he later learned that in truth his organs had shifted to prepare for the rest of the change.<br />
This hopes died when he noticed that his short buzz cut brown hair was turning a golden blonde color, even his brown eyes shifted to a deep sea blue. His heart rate picked up again, as he began to sweat a lot. He watched as his ears disappeared into his head, for a moment he heard absolutely nothing and for a couple of seconds the only thing he “heard” was the pounding of his heart and that was more of a feel. Then with a burst of pain, two pointed ears covered with blonde hair. He winced a bit again as he felt like he needed to take a shit however with a burst of pain he felt new bones grow within his body as the virus took some of his fat and used it to create bone, tissue and the like. <br />
“Lift up.” Ordered the Cat Nurse as Chris arched his back as she reached in and causing him to flinch at the sudden touch she pulled out his new tail. It was covered with golden yellow fur, with a white tip. <br />
“I think we have another cat on our hand.” Said the doctor as Chris winced again as his fingers and toes began to bleed, he lifted his hands up to see that he now had no finger nails but he could still feel them. He watched as the nail around his right thumb became claws before skin covered them. <br />
“Am…I…done…” started Chris only to feel like he had been punched in the gut by a heavy weigh boxer, he looked down to see his gut begin to lower itself at an unbelievable rate. His whole body began to shake as his shoulders snapped together and his hips changed as well. <br />
It didn’t take a college degree to figure out what was happening.<br />
“NO!” yelled Chris his voice now higher as his face began to round out, his short beard fell away as his skin smooth outed. His hands became longer and thinner along with his legs. Then with a wince of pain he felt his manhood sink back within his body, he knew what it meant…he was now a she. He was still flat chested but that quickly changed, it seamed that the virus decided to use the extra fat from his body to create a great ass and what had to be at least D cup breast. His hair also grew at an alarming rate passing his shoulders and kept going until the new golden curles touched her new breasts. <br />
“It’s going to be alright.” Reassured the doctor as Chris’s body felt beat to high heaven as the last changed happened. His or rather her eyes became slited. <br />
“Well…you still are mostly human.” Said the Bunny Doctor as Chris looked up into the mirror, he couldn’t recognize himself, he had to be a couple inches shorter but still tall for a women and he would guess he had dropped a few years to maybe 25 and God damn he was hot, or she was hot. A blonde bombshell even if you took away the cat ears and tail. “Could be worse.”<br />
“Looks like Neko.” Said the cat nurse as Chris looked at her. “It’s a cat women, with tails and ears but the rest is almost all human.”<br />
“I…I…see.” Said Chris<br />
“Lets get her into the shower.” Said the Doctor as the two nurses helped Chris into a wheelchair and took him out of the room. His head was still spinning, and he felt so tired like when he had finished two a days practices when he played football. <br />
“Where ar…” started Chris, his voice sounding so weird coming out of his mouth. <br />
“A shower, then a shake to help with your energy and then bed.” Said the Bunny nurse as they rolled her into a large bathroom, with a huge walk in shower. The two nurses helped him or rather her up and turned on the shower. The warm water felt so good as she closed her eyes and let out a moan as it felt so good. After the shower and the nurses put back on a hospital gown they rolled her to an elevator and to a wing of the hospital which was full of newly transformed people. <br />
Chris was passing in and out of it by now, his brain not fully believing it as he grabbed his chest and felt a bolt of pleasure. <br />
“I know it is hard, but you can’t do that in public.” Said the bunny nurse as she pulled his arms away from his new chest. <br />
“Here drink this.” Said the Cat nurse as she shoved a shake of some kind under her nose. It smell horrible and she didn’t want to drink it. “Your body has used a lot of energy in the change, you need this to help you deal with the change and believe me you will be hungry as hell when you wake up. If you don’t you will wake up in pain.”<br />
With shaking hands Chris took the shake and drank the horrible tasting shake. <br />
“Good, you are in room 72.” Said the Cat Nurse as they began to move down the hall, each room seamed to have two or four newly transformed people. They where all different ages and all different kinds of monsters. They reached the door marched 72 and entered to find that it had four beds, three of them seamed taken but those who had them where not currently there. They rolled her to the free bed and helped her onto the bed. She closed her eyes and was out within seconds, her body had been through hell and now he would begin life anew as a women and a Neko.</p>
