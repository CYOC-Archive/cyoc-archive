<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She decided to remain as Charlotte for at least a week, two at the most. “After that, I’ll figure out what to do next,” she reasoned as she examined her clothes in the closet and dresser before she choose a strapless demi-bra with padding in front to cover her erect nipples, a racerback tank top, a clean pair of low-rise briefs and a pair of shorts that buttoned up in front.<br />
<br />
	Dressed, she next took a look around her room. Immediately, she could tell that she was the type who’d grown up a tomboy, and still kind of was, liked horse and unicorns, was drawn to pastel shades, enjoyed the music genres rock, pop, and electronica, and had taken awards in swim competitions, all things she found she could remember. Curious to know what other changes, she gave the bedroom one final look, made her bed, something her memories insisted she did every morning, noted that she was in a relationship with a guy named Seth, and headed downstairs for breakfast.<br />
<br />
	If her the changes to her bedroom had caused her slight pause, it was nothing compared to the alterations to her reality she discovered as she headed through the house and entered the kitchen. The home she had grown up in now no longer looked dingy and in need of a thorough clean. Rather, it was bright and neat, with feminine traces everywhere. Wondering about her dad, she found she could recall that he was a deadbeat, and had booked it shortly after her mother had given birth to a daughter instead of a son, like the man had hoped. Of her mother, she could not only see, but remember that the woman was better off than when she’d had a son or two.<br />
<br />
	Taking in the signs that her mother was doing well in a high paying job she’d worked hard at to get where she was at, she found she could also recall that her life was also better. Thinking of the year in college she’d already completed, how she had graduated top of her class from high school, she fetched herself something from the cupboards for breakfast. Eating at the table, which was no longer a cheap metal thing with a formica top, but a solid wood piece of furniture, she wondered what she should do with her day. Finishing, she remembered that she’d made plans to go out with Seth tonight, and figuring she had the day to do whatever she wanted, she cleaned her breakfast stuff and exited to kitchen to further explore her new world.<br />
<br />
	Hours later, more familiar with her new reality, and what it was like to be a human female, she shucked off her clothes. Seth would be over soon to pick her up and she found she wanted to look pretty for him, something that was a new experience for her. Naked as the day she was born, she went through her clothes, thinking as she did how, before when she’d been a guy, she hadn’t really been concerned with how she looked. Finding herself concerned with her appearance, she asked herself, “Is this normal for all girls?” as she tried to think back to what she’d observed how girls behaved when she’d been male.<br />
<br />
	Drawing a blank, as most of her previous life seemed to have been erased from her mind, she selected a cute skirt that would hug her body tight from her waist down to a titbit past her hips before it ballooned out and came down to shy of her knees. Thinking about underwear, she toyed with the idea of either a thong or another pair of low-rise briefs before she decided to skip it.<br />
<br />
	“After all,” she reasoned. “It’s not like I am on my period or anything,” and pulling on the skirt, she held it in place as she selected a cute top with spaghetti thin shoulders straps and padding in front to cover her chest.<br />
<br />
<br />
	A spritz of perfume on her wrists, neck, up her skirt, and in front of her, which she walked through, and she set about to tease her hair up into something cute and fetching. Aware that she now was spending more time on how long she got ready, she found that she didn’t know if this was normal, or just something she did, yet also didn’t care. Choosing a pair of strappy heels that had a block heel that added two inches to her five foot three height she sat down to put them on. Pleased with how she looked and felt, she gave the straps over the top of her feet and around her ankles one last check before she went downstairs to wait for her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
	She had no idea where he planned to take her. She could recall that she asked, and that  he’d told her, “It’s a surprise,” with a smile.<br />
<br />
	Part of her, that which was still male, as well as a cat, something that surprised her when she’d discovered earlier those two aspects where still very much a part of her, wasn’t happy with this and was tempted to call Seth and ask him, to bug him until her told. Whilst the part of her that was clearly female didn’t mind and looked forward to whatever surprise the guy had, knowing it would be something they both would like and enjoy. Speculating on where he might be taking her, she practically flew out the door when she saw his car. Leaping at him as he came up the walk, she hugged him and when he kissed her, she didn’t blink as she returned it, even though earlier she’d wondered what she would do if her boyfriend wanted to hold her hand or kiss her, if the part of her that was still male would be repulsed.<br />
<br />
	“How you been?” Seth asked.<br />
<br />
	In response, she gave him another kiss and inquired, “So, where we going?”<br />
<br />
	Rather than answer this, he turned headed back to his car. Knowing this was his normal response, that he didn’t mean anything by it, except that she would have to wait a little longer, she fell in step next to him. When they reached the vehicle, she climbed in the passenger seat whilst he took the driver’s seat. Starting the car, Seth smiled and said, “Found this great Mexican restaurant that also has a night club attached. Figured we could go out for dinner and dancing.”<br />
<br />
	Excited by, she leaned over, gave him another kiss and whispered, “It sounds perfect,” before she sat back, adjusted her skirt, the way she sat, and buckled her seatbelt.<br />
<br />
	Their talk on the way to the restaurant mostly about the upcoming school semester, as Seth was also a student and the local university was were they’d met, they compared course schedules and guessed what their professors would be like. When they reached their destination, their talk shifted to other things. Dinner passed in a blur of idle talk, ordering, and eating and she completely forgot to try and compare any of what was happening to how her life had been.<br />
<br />
	When the music from the cantina started to blare through the building, she allowed herself to be led from the table. Full, a little bit tipsy from the alcoholic drink she had with dinner, she found herself feeling comfortable as she went on the dance floor. The music getting to her, she gave herself over to it as she pressed against Seth as they moved to the electronica dance music that had a heavy bass. Her hands worked up and down both her body and his, and as one song transitioned into another, she began to lose track of time as she enjoyed herself, only aware that any had passed when she stopped to get something to drink or to go to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
	By 11.30, she found that she was as thoroughly soused as her boyfriend. But at the same time, didn’t care. Warmth from the close proximity of the nearby bodies, the booze she’d steadily drunk all evening, plus something she hadn’t counted on happening quite yet, arousal and general horniness for the guy she was with, she could tell he felt the same way. Pressing against him, feeling his hardness through his jeans, she played her hands over his body, then over hers, taking her time when she came to the more sensitive areas. Feeling him kissing her, she pressed closer and told him, “I want you, college boy.”<br />
<br />
	“And I want you, college girl,” he tittered back.<br />
<br />
	Relaxed, glad she hadn’t worn any undergarments, she continued to kiss him as he pulled her closer and cupped one of her breasts through her shirt. Their dance starting to move them, it wasn’t long before they’d gotten to a space that was off the dance floor, away from people and traffic, and dark. Each starting to breath heavy, she had one thought, “It’s too soon for this,” before she gave over to what her body wanted as she felt her arousal grow, her genitals grow slick, and a buzzy, tingly sensation that was almost an ache went up her vagina and into her body to mix, comfortably, with the warmth she felt. Fumbling with Seth’s pants, she knew what she wanted as used her other hand to lift her skirt.<br />
<br />
	With a grunt, Seth lifted her and managed to hold her up. Her legs wrapped around him, feeling his exposed erect member probing her, she moaned in anticipation. Kisses and touches grew more passionate and she wasn’t sure when her top had been lifted to expose her breasts, but she was glad, as the air felt great on her bare flesh and her boyfriend’s hands felt better caressing them that way instead of through the fabric.<br />
<br />
	Around them, the music continued to thump, which she found seemed to increase how turned on she was. And when Seth finally thrust his way into her, she gasped, grabbed his shoulders tightly, and started to match his movements as best as she could until, with a shudder first from him, then from her, he blew his load inside her and she climaxed.<br />
<br />
	Sated, they remained entwined together for a little longer before he gently extracted himself from her and she slid down and away. Footing unsure, she adjusted her top to cover herself as he pulled up his pants. When he offered her his hand, she took it as best as she could and followed him back out onto the dance floor, trying to think through alcoholic haze as to which had been better - sex as a female cat or sex as a female human. Unable to decide which, she smiled a secret smile to herself, figured it probably didn’t matter, and tittered at the thrill of what they&#39;d done and that they hadn&#39;t gotten caught.</p>
