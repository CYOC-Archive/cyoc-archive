<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was shocked to see the two cheerleader siblings. The junior cheerleader, Abigail and her little sister, the freshman cheerleader, Allison. I really didn’t know much about them, especially since they kept themselves. They rely and protect each other so much. It’s almost as if it was a codependency. I was surprised that Brad invited both of them after all you can invite Abigail without inviting Allison. <br />
<br />
Their costumes were a bit odd. Abigail like most of the junior cheerleaders wore animal theme costumes. However, out of all of them, Abigail was the most courageous who, from what I could tell, wore a bikini, and body paint. Her skin was painted orange with stripes, she a tiger ear head band and a tail tied to her waist. Allison was wearing a shirt and a diaper. She came to the party as a baby?<br />
<br />
“Joey glad to see you now I need you to transform Abigail into a tiger. She has agreed to become my pet.” Mrs. Brockman announced to me. I looked shock and impressed.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” I started to say in confusion until Mrs. Brockman came closer and got her mouth to my ear.<br />
<br />
‘I need you to go along with this and follow my lead and if we are lucky, we can change Allison too. I want you to transform her into a baby around Jessica‘s age.’ She whispered, I looked at her goals, but decided to play along.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you want this?” I asked Abigail. “This could be a one-way trip you could end up as a tiger permanently. Are you sure you want to be Mrs. Brockman‘s pet?”<br />
<br />
“I’m positive. My life would be 100 times better if I was just her pet.” Abigail said, making me shock at this.<br />
<br />
“What about your sister?” I asked only for Allison to nervously nodded.<br />
<br />
‘They told me their life story so yeah as far as Abigail and Allison are concerned Abigail being a tiger is an improvement.’ Mrs. Brockman whispered to me. At this point, I want to get this over with so I can go to the guest house and spend time with Monique.<br />
<br />
“Okay then; Abigail, put this on .” Instructed as I conjured a collar in my hand. At the front was a tag. On onside it said, Abigail, answers to Abby. The other side had The Brockman‘s address and contact information in case she was found. Abby bunched up her hair and lifted it so that Joey could put the collar on her. After locking it in place, I motion towards the king size bed.<br />
<br />
“Now please lay stretch out on the bed.” I instructed Abigail. She did just as she was told and stretched out on the bed on her stomach. As if she can read my mind Mrs. Brockman had in her hands a sheet and together we covered up Abby with it. Finally I wished up a wand in my hand; then proceed the tap Abby’s figure from the head to her back and finally her feet.<br />
<br />
Abby‘s figure changed as if she was gaining weight or mass. When I was done, I pulled off the sheet revealing a full grown tiger inside that wore a collar with a tag that read Abigail. Mrs. Brockman broke out in applause while it looked like Allison was having tears in her eyes. Abby, despite being a ferocious tiger now got off the bed and rub up against my leg purring as if she’s overgrown cat.<br />
<br />
‘Goodbye Abby.’ Allison whisper, but me and Mrs. Brockman can hear it. Then all the sudden Allison’s stomach growl causing her to blush.<br />
<br />
“Well I better go downstairs and get something to eat. I must’ve forgotten to eat.” Alison announced to me and Mrs. Brockman. However, an idea formed in my head, and I made some mental wishes.<br />
<br />
“Actually going downstairs is not a good idea at this moment.” I announced making Allison stop her tracks.<br />
<br />
“Why?” Allison asked.<br />
<br />
“They’re breaking out into sex downstairs aren’t they? Including Brad?” Mrs. Brockman interrupted me before I can answer. I nodded my head only for Mrs. Brockman to sigh.<br />
<br />
“Calm down Julie it’s just for one night. He is the birthday boy. If he wants an orgy, then he’s in his right to have one for his 18th birthday. I’ll deal with this in the morning.” Mrs. Brockman muttered to herself before composing herself. “Besides I may have something that may meet your nutritional needs.”<br />
<br />
“Really where?” Allison asked curiously. <br />
<br />
“Right here.” Mrs. Brockman said if the emphasize her point she grabbed her top of where her press was and jiggled it. It shocked Allison, who turned to me as if I can have the answer. In which case I did as I wish the wand away.<br />
<br />
“When I regressed Jessica back to a month old, I gave Mrs. Brockman the ability to have breastmilk again.” I explain.<br />
<br />
“I’m way too old.” Alison start the protest. I grabbed the sheet and held it up.<br />
<br />
“That’s an easy fix and plus you have the option of returning to being older.” I stated, and as if her body was disagreeing with her, Allison stomach growled again.<br />
<br />
“Fine” Allison announce. I poked her forehead with my thumb.<br />
<br />
“It’s a little security insurance.” I said answering the question that she was probably going to ask, before I put the sheet over her. Then I place my hand with the ring over her forehead and pushed down. Allison starts regressing under the sheet without me touching her. Just like with Jessica earlier does she goes was a lump on the floor. Surprisingly Abby grab the sheet with her mouth and pull it off revealing a one month old Allison wearing nothing but a diaper.<br />
<br />
Abby sniff the little Allison before giving her a soft lick on the head, causing Alison the giggle. Mrs. Brockman gave a squeal as she went over and scoop up Allison.<br />
<br />
“Oh Allie, you are so cute, even cuter than Jessica.” Mrs. Brockman said.<br />
<br />
“Tha u.” Came a surprising little voice from the baby. Mrs. Brockman turned to look at me.<br />
<br />
“She talks!” Mrs. Brockman exclaim.<br />
<br />
“That security insurance I mention earlier. Jessica, who rapidly mentally regress as soon as possible. Allison‘s mentality is intact for now.” I explain, but then Mrs. Brockman proceeded to move part of her top to expose one of her breast. I decided to give Abby some affection while we wait for Mrs. Brockman to finish feeding Allison. Soon Allison gave a burp and Mrs. Brockman had put her top back on properly. I looked over to the woman and the baby then walked up to them.<br />
<br />
“Tha u i wa go.” Allison say. “Me b nor no?”<br />
<br />
“That’s negotiable but all you have to do is keep that diaper of yours clean for the next five minutes. If you don’t, you will mentally regress to the age you’re currently is now and you will now be Mrs. Brockman‘s adopted daughter.” I explained, and Mrs. Brockman gave me a look as if I was a sly fox.<br />
<br />
“Ke cle? Ea!” Allison cute state.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure Allison?” Mrs. Brockman ask. “Your sister and yourself told your entire life story. I don’t mind having to adopt and raise you and Jessica. If it was up to me, I would have more children than the three I have. However, due to a condition I suffer from after giving birth. It makes things difficult and it’s why I had my tubes tied after giving birth to Betty.”<br />
<br />
“Plus you would be able to stay with Abby. Don’t you want that? And all it would cost is you growing up as a new Brockman?” Mrs. Brockman drove the point home. Allison despite being young was making thoughtful looks. Then her face started to shift between different faces, as if parts of her was arguing with herself. Soon the five minute mark was approaching and as if to make a statement, Allison start talking again struggling as if find the right words.<br />
<br />
“I a…I a…I a…”</p>
