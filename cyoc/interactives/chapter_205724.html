<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan woke up in a daze the following morning. His head was pounding, his eyes felt blinded by the sun and everything was sore…<br />
<br />
“The hangover from hell.” He muttered as he quickly went to the bathroom purging himself from all the alcohol.<br />
<br />
“What happened last night?” His memories were so foggy. He couldn’t really remember much.<br />
<br />
Images of a girl kept popping up tho. A busty dark haired beauty. She was the life of the party and everyone wanted her. She was one the sexiest girls he had ever seen. <br />
<br />
Ryan went back to his phone and saw his phone was filled with all sorts of texts.<br />
<br />
“Where are you?”<br />
<br />
“Come check this chick out!”<br />
<br />
Patrick and his other guy friends had messaged him throughout the night and he never replied. <br />
<br />
That was strange. Did he black out or something he didn’t remember?<br />
<br />
Opening his phone Ryan’s eyes suddenly went wide. There were a ton of selfies on his phone. All of this girl. She was posing in her bikini showing off her huge tits and amazing ass. <br />
<br />
“Did we hook up?” Ryan couldn’t believe he would have forgotten that. <br />
<br />
That didn’t make sense, if they hooked up, why did his friends message him asking where he went when they were partying with her all night?<br />
<br />
After a long hot shower and a cup of coffee. Ryan went back to his day. His mind however never let up on the night before. <br />
<br />
After a workout Ryan went to a local sandwich place nearby for lunch. His friend Patrick said he would come by as well. When he arrived Patrick had the look of someone in love…<br />
<br />
“You won’t believe this girl man. She came out of nowhere, she was sexy, funny, cool. Not stuck up at all.” Patrick kept saying.<br />
<br />
“She seems like quite the girl.” Ryan said trying to keep all those selfies to himself right now. <br />
<br />
“Why did you bail last night? nobody remembers seeing you leave.” Patrick asked<br />
<br />
Ryan didn’t really have an answer. He wasn’t sure and didn’t really want to answer.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I must have not been feeling well.” Ryan responded.<br />
<br />
“Are you coming to the club tonight?” Patrick asked<br />
<br />
“Which club?” Ryan asked a bit confused.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t hear? Downtown the new club, Sparks. It’s having its grand re-opening after the remodel. The owner is a rich alumni so all students get in free tonight.” Patrick said.<br />
<br />
Ryan thinks he had heard something about that earlier but his mind was still too hazy.<br />
<br />
“I’m going hoping I see her again.” Patrick said.<br />
<br />
“Do you even know her name?” Ryan replied.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s Rebecca. It’s weird I just never got her number and I can’t find her anywhere online.” Patrick replied.<br />
<br />
After lunch the two of them went their separate ways for now. Ryan said he would consider dropping by the club tonight. Maybe he could meet this mysterious Rebecca tonight.<br />
<br />
As Ryan was walking back to his car he suddenly heard a voice call out to him. It seemed to be coming from a nearby alleyway.<br />
<br />
Ryan walked over and saw someone standing there hiding. <br />
<br />
“Hello?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
The mysterious figure slowly emerged from the alleyway.<br />
<br />
To Ryan’s surprise it was a woman. She was gorgeous, especially considering her age. She had to be at least 50 but her appearance made her look at least 10 years younger.<br />
<br />
She had long silver hair tied up in a braid all the way down to her ankles. She was wearing a skin tight white dress and heals. Her boobs were huge and her entire figure was an hourglass. It was obvious she was older but she still looked great for her age.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” Ryan asked a bit taken back.<br />
<br />
“Just listen to me…You can’t go out tonight, no matter what. You have to lock yourself inside.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” Ryan said.<br />
<br />
“I was once like you, over 20 years ago the same curse was passed to me when cheated on my girlfriend at the time who was also a witch.” The lady said.<br />
<br />
“Listen lady I think you are confused.” Ryan said about to turn away.<br />
<br />
“It will happen again tonight and then tomorrow. Every month three times a month. If you let her out she will get stronger and stronger. Soon it will happen more and more, eventually and slowly taking over until well…nothing is left of you.” <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry let who out?” Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
“You know…you can feel her can’t you? Chain yourself up. Handcuff yourself. Whatever it takes. Trust me.” The lady said before walking away.<br />
<br />
Ryan stood there a bit confused. What the hell was that about? <br />
<br />
Ryan went back home shortly after. He spent his evening on his computer looking up various things. He couldn’t forget that weird woman and the way she spoke to him. Was there any truth to what she said?</p>
