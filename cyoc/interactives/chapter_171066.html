<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After day 8 the bluish IV bags were replaced with normal ones. <br />
<br />
She finally slipped out from beneath the covers and looked at her body. As she sat on the side of the bed she noticed how small her feet had become, could they support her weight? Sarah put one foot down and then another foot. Her gown had been past Chris&#39; knees but a combination of breasts and height increase allowed the material to ride up the length of her body.<br />
<br />
Her body was sore and felt as if she had been electrocuted. Slowly she stumbled over to the mirror in the bathroom. Sarah realized that a week before a woman with a body like this would have given him a hard on that could crack steel. However that wasn&#39;t the purpose. Between the heaviness in her chest, the long but thin legs felt brittle and could snap. <br />
<br />
She looked at herself in the mirror and burst into tears, her breasts pushed into the fabric just as Megan&#39;s had done back in the Extractor&#39;s office. This body gave her a week ago dark thoughts but now she was thinking that this was a huge mistake. A hand came from behind and plucked off her gown. Now Sarah was staring at her nude body. <br />
<br />
No  more penis instead a pair of lips and public hair breasts that were not D cups but Cs and perky nipples. A pair of female hands grabbed each nipple between thumb and forefinger and pinched. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ow fuck!&quot; wailed Sarah.<br />
<br />
Her breasts felt like water balloons about to burst and automatically (it seemed) she covered them with her right hand and vagina with her left hand. There she saw Megan sitting with her hair down, it was dark brown today. She had makeup on with blood red lipstick. She wore a white lace singlet top that barely contained her breasts and a pair of stone washed jeans without a belt along with open toed sandals. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; Megan asked, when not talking her face looked like that of a doll&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s nipples hardened.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Still thinking with the man&#39;s brain huh?&quot; Megan leaned forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of my finest work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t...I look wrong...&quot; Sarah intoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the Ambassador&#39;s wife has decided to have a baby which meant she was off the table. Instead I managed to get one that matched your desires and is even Russian. You are now Julia Jaunzeme, the young mistress of the Lithuanian Ambassador to the US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to speak Russian? You told me that wouldn&#39;t work. Fortunately Mr Jaunzeme, like former President Trump, is a fan of beauty pageants. You were original born in Horizontina, same place as Gisele Bündchen  if you need a reference, Brazil. Lots of whites living there without their DNA being breed out by the locals. Lots of Poles, Germans, Italians and Russians in gene pool. Your father is Lithuanian and left the USSR after the collapse and fucked your mother, a friend of Gisele&#39;s mother who was Polish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia, as she was now called, pulled a sheet over her breasts and started to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen changing genders is usually a surgical procedure, in your case it is a complete change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia sobbed quietly as Megan spoke into the silence. &quot;Julia has the ability to apply for a Lithuanian citizenship, makes you an EU citizen and gives you the run of Europe. Until the UK left, so the mainland is at your disposal. Russia too if you want the bright lights of Moscow now that Putin is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow you will be discharged and we will go clothes shopping. NO! You can&#39;t go alone, I want to watch you will go in when you are in public. We will tell them that a fire destroyed your clothes and I am a friend helping you shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not shop online?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Later, first time for your new body is to get your size.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next day Megan gave her a pair of black Calvin Klein panties with the name in a white trim. She had the same gray top that she had seen Megan wear before the Extractor changed displaying the power of what s/he was selling. Her bare breasts had pushed into the fabric, not as much as Megan&#39;s but that girl was bigger chested and had bigger breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have to get used to showing your breasts. We will start with fabric, in private you will spend time with your body and I will spend time with you in private. If I am not satisfied with your progress then you be performing at a strip club. Actually I might do that anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia gulped.<br />
<br />
They went shopping at Victoria Secret&#39;s where she was shocked at the types of lingerie, panties, bra and other accessories that she had access to. Megan confirmed she was paying. The assistant measured her and told her she was a 32D. She a collection of conservative bra and panties, she liked black she found. She had a black underwear top with a petticoat. <br />
<br />
Julia was then urged to buy something more see thru material. She had boy shorts done up out of jean material and white lace bra that showed her breasts. A black lace bra and matching panties was next with a push up bra that made her look like she was a E or F cup, her breasts were like two Zeppelins in a dead heat race. <br />
<br />
Julia&#39;s style would be black panties with black stockings and boned suspender belt for a pair of black stockings. She wanted a front hooking bra but Megan insisted that this would not do and all the &#39;normal women&#39; managed it from behind. They tried on heels but walking in them would be for another day. Megan then picked out the dresses Julia (real one), jeans shorts that rode up the crack of her butt, black strapless dresses, white crop tops that covered her breasts but showed her stomach and the beginning of her rib cage.<br />
<br />
They also got the jeans in black and white, they went for a bikini, but Julia (real one) used single piece swimsuits. she was allowed some two piece bikinis for personal taste. She had a pair of sunglasses with red plastic frames and looked like 50s or 60s but with her face they didn&#39;t matter. Julia then got a silk robe that she tried on with panties and a bra. In her mind she wanted to learn how to control her assets, kept them under control. <br />
<br />
When Julia asked Megan how long she could maintain Megan: &quot;2 weeks is the most but I need stims to maintain the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then asked how long she would be stuck as Julia: &quot;A month, to insure the change on demand and most importantly to see that you can pass for Julia.&quot;</p>
