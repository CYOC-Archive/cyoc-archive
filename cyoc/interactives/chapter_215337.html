<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The atmosphere was different somehow. Someone had turned the jukebox on, and it was playing an old song by Crystallica. He coughed and waved a hand in front of his face. The air was thick with smoke from cigarettes and cigars. That bar smell had intensified as well. There was something else to that wasn’t quite right. <br />
<br />
It took him a moment to see what was out of place. Caleb had to double check, but he was pretty sure there were more people inside, now. In fact, he had to shoulder past a few people just to get near the bathroom. The weirdest part was that they were all older-looking, faces lined and weathered. And all of them dressed like bikers.<br />
<br />
Which was nonsense, though he had to brush past a huge man with thick muscles and a heavy gut that was half as big as the fake one Caleb was sporting. <br />
<br />
His hand made contact with it and instead of feeling rubber or a couch cushion, he actual thought it felt warm and kinda soft. The other guy, whose thick, graying brown hair was buzzed into a flat top, had a face that was puffy but handsome with some serious gray mutton chops framing it. He turned and winked at Caleb, making his pulse quicken and his cock harden.<br />
<br />
“Hey big guy,” The man said, his voice deep and gravelly, “My name’s Brent. Want to get a drink with me?”<br />
<br />
Caleb felt some pressure on his cock. He moaned and glanced down only to see Brent’s  muscled, hairy arm was extended out underneath Caleb’s big fake belly, groping Caleb’s hard-on.<br />
<br />
“D-drink?” Caleb croaked, his voice cracking.<br />
<br />
“Come on,” The biker demanded. He was old enough to be Caleb’s dad, with a voice just as stern, and was staring at Caleb with deep blue eyes. It was enough to make Caleb’s heart flutter. The pressure on Caleb’s cock increased as Brent rubbed a little harder. “Let’s get a drink.”<br />
<br />
Numbly, Caleb let himself be led back to his seat at the bar.  <br />
<br />
He didn’t remember any Brents coming to the party. As he sat down on the stool with his well-cushioned ass, he realized he barely recognized anyone in the bar, now. Maybe a few people here and there, but the rest was filled with strangers. Men were gyrating on the poles. Big men, with guts and hair covering their muscular bodies. And Caleb found it all… rather erotic.<br />
<br />
“Can I get you boys anything?” Dustin asked, his voice cracking and deepening as he spoke. “Beer, whiskey?”<br />
<br />
Caleb stared at Dustin. <br />
<br />
Dustin’s overly-inflated stomach looked oddly realistic.  Caleb knew that it was just a beachball Dustin had stuffed under his shirt, but still, the more he looked,  the more he couldn’t shake the fact that something was very different about Dustin’s body.. <br />
<br />
It was the sag, perhaps. Not just of his belly, but of his pecs, which drooped heavily onto his gut. Or perhaps it was his chin, which seemed to have swallowed his neck, from what little of it Caleb could see under the man’s long, gray beard, which descended halfway down his incredibly large, bulbous belly.  <br />
<br />
Caleb realized Dustin was still smiling at him, though that only made the crow’s feet around his eyes look even deeper. There were bags under them as well, deep dark ones. Dustin looked OLD, haggard even. He thought he saw a gap in the man’s yellowing teeth as Dustin cracked a smile. Dustin reached over to an ashtray where a cigarette was burning, flicked it, then took a puff.<br />
<br />
“Whiskey,” Brent said decisively, turning his gaze back to Caleb.<br />
<br />
“Caleb?” Dustin asked, raising a brow.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, just a beer, thanks,” Caleb’s voice cracked again, getting deeper.<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded and quickly poured him a pint glass of amber liquid from the tap. <br />
<br />
‘Wait a second’ Caleb thought to himself, wasn’t the bar supposed to be completely empty? No one would have left full bottles sitting on the shelves of an out-of-business bar. And yet, as Dustin turned, his haunches just as round and bulbous as his gut, stretching his jeans tight, Caleb could see exactly that: bottles of full liquor lining the shelves. <br />
<br />
Dustin came back and poured a glass for Brent, sliding a shot-glass to Caleb.<br />
<br />
“You look like you could use one,” Dustin winked.<br />
<br />
As Dustin walked away to help another customer, Caleb saw himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
He was big, really big, with tits just as full and saggy as Dustin’s. The cushions seemed to have settled more naturally on his huge gut. It wasn’t nearly as round and bulbous as Dustin’s, at least. Caleb chugged his beer, then realized he’d been wrong. His belly seemed to inflate as he drank, stretching his shirt tight, big and round as a blimp. He burped, wiping the foam on the back of his fat, hairy arm. <br />
<br />
“Nice one!” Brent grinned, slapping Caleb’s thigh.<br />
<br />
Caleb turned to ask him not to touch him like that and found the man’s mouth pressed to his, Brent’s tongue sliding down his throat. <br />
<br />
He tried to push him away, but the man encircled him with his heavily muscled arms, pulling him deeper into the kiss. Brent’s tongue was cold and he tasted like whiskey and old cigars, but Caleb found the taste exciting. He kissed back, his tongue wrestling with Brent’s.<br />
<br />
Brent’s arm fell, groping Caleb’s groin again, pushing aside the gut and gently massaging the hard nub. <br />
<br />
Caleb returned the favor, finding that the man’s had a sizeable crotch, even with the beer belly he sported. Brent’s cock was long and thick, hard as a rock and extending down his pant leg. Caleb rubbed, hearing the man rumble a moan into Caleb’s mouth as their facial hair scratched together delightfully.<br />
<br />
Finally, Brent pulled away, a sparkle in his eyes. “Fuck, your mouth is perfect, Caleb.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Brent,” Caleb panted, running his tongue around his lips to taste the man some more. “You’re a hot daddy bear.”<br />
<br />
He wondered why he’d called Brent that. Sure, he knew what a bear was, but he’d never been so attracted to one before. <br />
<br />
As Caleb sat there, dumbstruck by what was going on around him, he couldn’t help but notice the thick gold loop in Brent’s right ear. It wasn’t a look that Caleb thought he liked, but for some reason it really looked good on Brent. The big bearish daddy smiled, running a hand over the top of Caleb’s smooth scalp. It was an odd sensation that drew attention to the coolness of the air as it washed over the bare skin.<br />
<br />
“You know, I like a man who’s confident enough to shave it all off when he goes bald.” Brent said.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s not quite-~” Caleb coughed, the frog in his throat getting worse. He continued, “Ah’m not really bald.”<br />
<br />
“Ha, sure, you shaved it cause it’s thinning!” Brent nodded as though he understood, running his hands over Caleb’s head again. Caleb felt nothing save for the man’s big, rough hand grazing the shaved sides of his head before rubbing his smooth dome. “It looks good on you though. I like your tattoos, too. Especially the bear.”<br />
<br />
“Bear?” Caleb stared at him, confused.<br />
<br />
“Your tattoo, man,” Brent rolled his eyes, pointing at Caleb’s arm.<br />
<br />
Caleb looked down at his hammy arm and saw the colorful sleeve of tattoos the bodysuit had come with. Maybe it had been a trick of the light, but they looked faded, more natural, like they’d been there for a while. <br />
<br />
Brent was pointing at a tattoo of a large bear crushing a dove in its jaws, drawn in a very Japanese style, with hints of browns, oranges, blacks and creams in the fading colors. And it took up most of the space on his right arm. Which was weird, since Caleb thought there had been a bunch of Americana tattoos there a few minutes ago. Maybe he was misremembering? He was feeling a little tipsy, after all.<br />
<br />
“It looks nice. Who was the artist?” Brent asked.<br />
<br />
“Err…”<br />
<br />
Caleb wanted to tell him it was just a costume. None of this was real. But how could he tell this hot daddy he wasn’t really his type? <br />
<br />
“Ah, was it Eddie?” Brent said.<br />
<br />
Caleb just nodded dumbly.<br />
<br />
“Sweet, he did mine too. See?” Brent turned and showed off his own full sleeve. <br />
<br />
His tattoo was done in a more realistic style. It depicted a grizzly fishing a dove out of the sky with one paw.  It was hard to tell through the thick hair on Brent’s arm, but the colors on his tattoo were even more faded than the ones on Caleb’s, to the point that whatever color scheme it originally had was now lost to dull blue. <br />
<br />
“I like it.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, got it right after I got patched in.” Brent grinned as Caleb examined his arm closer. <br />
<br />
“Is that a Navy Seals tattoo?” Caleb’s eyes widened as he saw what looked an eagle grasping a matchlock from behind an anchor.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yeah,” Brent licked his lips and took a swig of whiskey before tugging his arm away. “It was an interesting time.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell?” Caleb asked.<br />
<br />
Brent’s blue eyes darkened and he looked away, “Something like that. Gave ‘em nine years of my life. Fuck ‘em.”<br />
<br />
Caleb wanted to say something, but the man took another swig of whiskey, still staring off into the distance. He considered touching Brent, maybe patting him on the back to console him, but he didn’t know the guy that well. They’d literally just met and Caleb hadn’t meant to kill the mood.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey Caleb!” Josh’s voice cut through the clamor of patrons around the bar as large figured tussled onto the stool next to Caleb.<br />
<br />
Caleb turned to see a moderately large, round beer belly hung over Josh’s belt. Caleb guessed Josh had managed to tape the pillow into place. It looked unnervingly realistic, his stomach bulging and sagging softly in all the right places. He thought he could even see the indent of Josh’s belly button where the black shirt stretched taut across the bottom of the gut. The rest of his body was stacked with muscles, though soft around the edges with a small layer of chub rounding out his pecs, giving them a slight droop. That was new.<br />
<br />
When he looked up at Josh’s face, he frowned.<br />
<br />
Josh looked… old. <br />
<br />
Not, like, old old, like the hot DILF next to Caleb or Dustin, but definitely older. He was wearing a backwards-facing baseball cap, probably to help conceal a receding hairline. Caleb could see heavy wrinkle lines on his forehead and the scalp that peaked through the cap was smooth. He must have been wearing a bald cap under it, using the hat to disguise the edges of the latex. It was rather clever.<br />
<br />
 Josh grinned, “So have you found Steve yet?”<br />
<br />
“Steve?” Caleb blinked.<br />
<br />
“Your boyfriend?” Josh nudged Caleb’s side hard enough that he felt it through the cushion.<br />
<br />
Caleb’s eyes widened. “Wait, you knew?”<br />
<br />
“Knew?” Josh chuckled, taking a sip of beer, “Bro, I set this whole thing up just for you two!”<br />
<br />
Caleb grinned, patting Josh’s gut.<br />
<br />
It jiggled and sloshed and felt warm and squishy, like a real, actual gut. While Caleb stared in shock at his hand, which had sunk a bit into his best friend’s gut, Josh just laughed, making his gut shake some more. It sure as hell didn’t feel like a pillow! If Caleb wasn’t mistaken… it was as real as Brent’s.<br />
<br />
Caleb just sat there, his hand pressed into Josh’s jiggling gut, as the realization sunk into him. Something was very wrong here. <br />
<br />
His best friend looked at least a decade older, maybe more. And the costume… it was just too realistic. This was all getting too weird for him. Caleb swore Josh’s ass was bigger too, and he definitely hadn’t stuffed a pillow back there.<br />
<br />
“Thanks man,” Caleb said, his voice settling into a deep baritone with a hint of a southern accent. He felt a strange ache in his balls as it did. They pulsed and clenched in his pants, sending a warm flush throughout his body, making him feel a little itchy. “Ah’m real glad for it.”<br />
<br />
“No problem big guy,” Josh grinned, patting Caleb on his back and making his body jiggle. While Caleb was busy dealing with that odd sensation, Josh leaned forward conspiratorially. “Who’s the hot daddy bear next to you?”<br />
<br />
“That’s Brent,” Caleb whispered back.<br />
<br />
“Guess your cup is overflowing tonight. He’s been shooting glances at you the whole time we’ve been talking.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s been real sweet on me,” Caleb grinned.<br />
<br />
“Just make sure you talk to Steve before you start hitting on other guys.” Josh gave Caleb a sly wink, then picked up his drink and wandered over to the pool table.<br />
 <br />
Right, Steve. Speaking of Steve, where the hell was Steve, anyways? <br />
<br />
This entire thing had started when he’d come back inside to look for Steve, only to find himself distracted by Brent. Not that he was complaining, it was a pleasant distraction, but still. Steve had said he was in the bathroom, right?<br />
<br />
“Uh, you know what?” Caleb turned to Brent, breaking the older man out of his revere. “I gotta go hit the head real quick.”<br />
<br />
“Ha, I’ll be waiting for you, big guy!” Brent chuckled, making Caleb’s heart flutter again.<br />
<br />
He heaved himself off the bar-stool, feeling an odd pulling sensation as he did so. <br />
<br />
Weight shifted downwards, the heavy cushion attached to the front of the rubber suit sagging heavily, tugging softly on his tits, stomach and ass. He wobbled, feeling oddly off balance and top heavy. Caleb huffed, leaning back a bit to balance his stomach. It jutted forward, the hem of his shirt pulling out of his jeans, exposing the bottom of his huge gut. <br />
<br />
Caleb felt bloated, his stomach feeling tight. He glanced down at it and gave his huge gut a pat, causing a large burp to well up in his throat, and though he felt the tightness lessen, he still felt overly full. His stomach jiggled as he burped again, the sensations making his cock twitch. <br />
<br />
He waddled towards the bathroom, brushing past the rest of the men. <br />
<br />
And they were men. Big, hairy, heavy gutted, middle aged or older. All of them were dressed like bikers and Caleb noticed more than a few with tattoos of bears devouring doves on their arms. They weren’t just drinking or talking, most of them were rubbing each other or kissing.<br />
<br />
The jukebox was playing a country song and more than a few of the guys were singing along, cups of beer raised. Caleb thought he recognized a few of them from his school, but they were much older, nearly unrecognizable save for their eyes and even then, it was hard to tell.<br />
<br />
He hadn’t gone very far, maybe fifty feet from the bar to the bathrooms, but Caleb was panting and huffing heavily by the time he reached the door. The suit was feeling weird now, hot and slimy on the inside, while sweat was dripping down Caleb’s brow. He wanted nothing more than to shuck the heavy thing off, but he needed to find Steve first.<br />
<br />
Wheezing, Caleb opened the door with his shoulder and stumbled inside, the swing of his belly throwing him off balance.</p>
