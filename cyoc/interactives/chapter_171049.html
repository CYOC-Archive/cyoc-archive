<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They couldn’t even wait until the cover of night, they didn’t even wait until noon, nor did they even try to put their old clothes on their now hulking bodies. Jamie was certainly the alpha of the pack, as he gathered the entire house to the front door. Archie felt weirdly out of place. Sure, his recent growth into a 6ft hunk was nothing to scoff at, but even then he was dwarfed by his peers, who all towered over him at 6’6”. Their hardons jutting our menacingly from their toned waists, all soaking wet with what was left of their last loads. A huge puddle of their collective seed had formed by their large feet. None of them matched Jamie’s 10 inch monster, which bounced in anticipation as he walked towards the door. None of the boys could contain their overwhelming horniness, and the stench of teenage lust flooded from the house. Archie could feel it. The urge to jerk off. The urge to breed. It was almost unbearable. Jamie, cupping his own orange-sized balls, looked at the group with a wide grin.<br />
<br />
“So, you all know the plan?”<br />
<br />
The boys nodded. Archie could feel a large hand press firmly on his ass. He turned to see a 6’5” teen smile back. Archie could feel his elevated hormones slowly take over his mind. He didn’t want to be like this, he just wanted a good night’s sleep. Jamie’s grin grew even wider.<br />
<br />
“Good. The only rule is that the big guy is mine, got it? <br />
<br />
The boys nodded again. Archie let out a low moan as the hand gripped one of his cheeks tightly. But, before he could protest, Jamie flung the door open, his newfound strength almost sending it off its hinges.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
Like a flash of light, the boys were out of the house and onto the street. Without any hesitation, they made their way to the house of Zeta Epsilon Chi, which had ironically grown quiet since their party last night. Some of the boys clutched their cocks, holding them close to their abs as they walked. They felt a jolt of pleasure as their heavy balls swayed like two wrecking balls with every step. Archie could see Zach’s silhouette walk behind the curtain in one of the windows. The thought of seeing him. The thought of outgrowing him. It made Archie wild with lust. He realised that the group had had stopped a few steps from the door.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?”<br />
“Arch, knock on the door.”<br />
“Seriously? Are you guys still too shy?”<br />
“Just do it.”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Archie pounded his large fist into the door. The thrill of seeing the looks on their faces quickly spread amongst the boys. The anticipation, the waiting, it was killing them! <br />
<br />
Finally, after what felt like hours, they could hear heavy footsteps coming from the other side of the door. The footsteps grew louder, and louder, until they stopped. Then, the door slowly creaked open.<br />
<br />
Zach, the President of Zeta Epsilon Chi, had answered the door, again. This time, he was wearing a tight pair of blue jeans, which hugged his mighty thighs and calves. The outline of his morning wood was obvious, and prominent. He subconsciously massaged one of his pecs. Archie wasn’t sure if he was properly awake yet, as he sighed, his eyelids heavy.<br />
<br />
“What’s up, you here about the noise? Holy shit…”<br />
<br />
He rubbed his eyes and took a second look at what stood before him. He felt a mixture of shock and fear, as Jamie shouted at the top of his lungs.<br />
<br />
“CHAAAARGE!”<br />
<br />
Like a stampede, the boys dashed into the house, shoving both Archie and Zach towards the wall. The cacophony of their heavy feet woke the rest of the frathouse up, and as more of the jocks slowly rose from the pile of pillows in the middle of the hall, they too realised what was running madly towards them. Whilst some of them tried to frantically escape by running upstairs, others weren’t so lucky. One of Archie’s frat brothers had grabbed ahold of one of Zach’s, pressing him onto the floor with his huge body. Another grabbed one of them by the waist, and firmly pressed his boner against the guy’s back. Before long, the rest had found a jock of their own, and were eagerly stripping them of whatever clothes they were still wearing since their party. Whilst some of them tried to resist, the rest found themselves turned on by the boys’ dominance. Zach watched on in fear, only to realise Archie had him pinned against the wall.<br />
<br />
“No, wait! How did-“<br />
“You look cute in those jeans.”<br />
“Wha-ohhhh…”<br />
<br />
Zach moaned as Archie reached into his trousers, and gripped his cock. The teenage jock’s hormones were out of control. So were Zach’s. He didn’t protest when he felt his jeans come off, nor did he say anything when Archie gently leaned in, and the two began making out. Zach was forcefully spun around, and pushed even harder against the wall. Despite being taller than Archie by a few inches, he was surprisingly no match for the boy’s strength, mixed with the adrenaline fuelled by his hormonal rage. It wasn’t until Zach felt his asscheeks tense as Archie rested his cock between them did he finally speak up.<br />
<br />
“Wait, stop! How the fuck did you guys find the artifact!?”</p>
