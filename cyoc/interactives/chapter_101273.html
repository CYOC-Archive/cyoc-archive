<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucile was thinking about the instructions she read on the letter. The red one changes the age and the blue the growing process. But how much of each one she would use? She wanted his son and she though he was a good companion.<br />
&quot;Maybe a year or two. Just to see what happens&quot; She though. Then she changed of mind, if she changes her son a few years, he would become a teenager and at that age it&#39;s hard to control a son. She wanted a man who could take care of her, no one to take care of.<br />
&quot;I know what to do!&quot; She said and look for the dosage she needed to put to get the age she wanted.<br />
&quot;Now, about the growing duration...&quot; She though for an instant. &quot;I could make him to grow in month, or maybe in a week&quot; She look again at the letter. &quot;They want that I report the growing process... Maybe, if it&#39;s instant I don&#39;t need to take too much time and I would get the money.&quot; She said. &quot;I will use the máximum dosage of the blue drug&quot;<br />
Then, Lucile put both dosages on the pancake mix and she cooked a pile of pancakes for her son. After she finished, Raul arrived to kitchen.<br />
&quot;Good morning, mom.&quot; He said and then he saw the pancakes piled like a skyscraper. &quot;All those pancakes are mine?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Lucile said. &quot;I cooked some for the school sale but these ones are specially for you, baby.&quot;<br />
Raul leaped and ran to eat the pancakes without knowing what his mother had put on them. He was eating like a boar and the pile reduced too fast until it was left around five or six pancakes on the plate.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t eat any more&quot;. Raul said and he let out a big burp. Lucile saw some sign of his changing. The first ones were his height changing. He used to be around 4&#39;4&quot; and in a few seconds he looks like to be 5&#39;1&quot;.<br />
&quot;I fell so full. I need to unbutton my shirt.&quot; Raul said. Lucile saw that some hairs were growing in his son&#39;s hairless chest.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really fast&quot; She thought.<br />
&quot;My pants are tight too. I think I will unzip them too&quot;. Raul said while he unzipped his pants.<br />
Right now, he looked like a 16 years old. Some hair had grown on his chin, his chest and a traesure trail led Lucile to know he has growing pubes too.<br />
&quot;Ugh, I feel my shoes too tight.&quot; Raul said with a deeper voice, not the one for a kid, but for a teenager. &quot;These old shoes, they can&#39;t hold my growing feet!&quot;<br />
Lucile smiled a few. He had no idea. While Raul was untying his shoelaces his feet had grown too much that they burst out from the shoes, destroying them in the process.<br />
&quot;What the hell!&quot; Raul shouted while he was looking at his big and manly feet which had freed from his now small shoes. They were a size 12 now and covered with some hair on the top. &quot;My feet! They look older!&quot; He realized his voice was deeper now, like a Deep baritone. &quot;My voice! What&#39;s happening!&quot;<br />
Lucile left the kitchen and went to her room to look for a big mirror she had. When she returned she saw her son had ripped his shirt and he was only wearing his pants, as tight as they can be. She noticed he had developed a decent beard and a hairy chest which hid his nipples. He had some muscles and hair on his arms and a 6-pack. Maybe he was 21 years old right now. He was shocked and he took his head scared. That let Lucile to see he had devoloped two very hairy armpit.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening, mom!&quot; Raul shouted scared. &quot;I&#39;m becoming older and hairier!&quot;<br />
&quot;Look, baby. I bring my mirror to let you see yourself&quot; Lucile said I showed the mirror to her son. Raul took a look of it and he was terrified. He looked older like 24 or something. His pants were so tight that they finished giving up. A rip sound left Raul almost naked in front of his mother. He had left only a boxer which in the past was too big, but now it looked like a very skiny boxer. The pants ripping led Lucile to look his son&#39;s legs, muscled and hairy.<br />
&quot;How can I go to school looking like this!&quot; Raul shouted while he was looking at his bulge. &quot;This thing is not a kid&#39;s size!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a man size, baby&quot; Lucile said while she closed to her son and standed behind him. &quot;And men like to have it free!&quot; She ripped her son&#39;s tight boxer revealing a big pair of hairy testicles, with a size of lemons; a very messy bush of pubic hair, and a amazingly gorgeus penis as thick as a can and long as a salami. Raul was completely shocked.<br />
&quot;A little bit hairy on the butt, I should noted it for my report.&quot; Lucile said while she crouched. &quot;But a very firm and rounded ass, to be honest.&quot; She took her son&#39;s butt with her hands.<br />
&quot;Mom, what are you saying? What are you doing?&quot; Raul yelled.<br />
&quot;Looking how much big is my baby now&quot; Lucile said and she took his big penis on her hands. &quot;I mean, my man!&quot;</p>
