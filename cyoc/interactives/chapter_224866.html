<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The vibrating of his phone stirred Jensen from his slumber. With a groan, he sat up in his bed and grabbed for his phone, reading the text that Damon had just sent him:<br />
<br />
&#39;Just heading out now. Be there in 20. Be ready to go!&#39;<br />
<br />
Jensen’s phone told him it was 6:30 in the morning; way too early to be up on his day off from work. He set his phone back down on his bedside table and pulled the covers over his eyes, not ready to get out of bed. There was a nagging voice in his head telling him to get up and dressed for work, which made no sense; Jensen’s job as the HR manager at an office was a Monday to Friday job, and it was Saturday. Still, something felt off and he couldn’t drift back to sleep. With a relenting sigh, he finally stood up and did a large stretch. He’d expected to be sore after the grueling workout Damon had pushed him through the previous night, but he felt surprisingly refreshed. He wished he’d woken up a bit earlier, then he’d have time for a quick 10K run before Damon picked him up. <br />
<br />
Where the hell had that thought come from? Jensen had never ran a day in his life and loathed physical activity. He had blurry memories of being the star player on his cross country high school team, but that must have been from a lingering dream; after all, he was still half asleep. If he’d been more alert, Jensen would have noticed the subtle changes that had occurred to his room during the night, but in his groggy state he stumbled towards the bathroom unaware. The floor was clovered in messy piles of clothing; shirts, trackpants, boxers and socks were strewn across every surface. Posters of various video games and rock bands were plastered across the walls which had previously been vacant without decor. A weight rack with various dumbbells for lifting and curls was set up in the corner, replacing where his makeup vanity had previously been.<br />
<br />
Jensen flicked on the light switch in the bathroom, catching a glimpse of his appearance for the first time since waking up. He let out a startled shout at seeing the handsome man staring at him in the mirror. His brain’s first response was that there was an intruder in his house, but he quickly realized he was looking at his own reflection. In disbelief, he slowly waved his arm back and forth, watching as his reflection copied the action.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” He shouted before quickly covering his mouth, startled by the low tenor of his voice. Jensen wondered if he was still dreaming, but this felt real. He approached the mirror, studying his new body. It was like looking at a stranger, but a part of him felt familiar staring at his chiseled jaw and piercing brown eyes; hadn’t he always looked like this?<br />
<br />
Jensen’s memories of his previous life as Jenny remained, but he was starting to gain new memories as well. These new milestones were similar to the old ones, with some significant differences; instead of focusing on academics at school, he had been a jock, playing and excelling in all the sports. He hadn’t gone off to college, instead choosing to become a personal trainer with Damon right after graduation. The most significant difference, of course, was in his new memories he had always been a male. Surprisingly, while there were some slight variations, the memories of his boyfriends and men he’d dated remained largely unchanged. Was he gay?<br />
<br />
Jensen pushed these memories to the back of his mind, focusing on the task at hand. What had caused his changes? Was there a way to get his old body and life back? He noticed the black boxers hanging from around his hips, remembering the strange store he’d bought them from on the previous day. Could they be the cause of his changes? If he took them off, would he change back?<br />
<br />
In light of a better idea, Jensen pulled the boxers down and kicked them off, exposing his new member. Though he had some fuzzy memories of it, this was the first time Jensen was seeing his dick; he’d been with enough men to know that he was well endowed, quite above average. He looked down at his impressively thick shaft, embarrassed when it started to fill with blood and harden; he was turning himself on. <br />
<br />
Jensen watched his body carefully in the mirror, looking for any signs that he was reverting back to his feminine body after removing the boxers. The loose T-shirt he’d worn to bed the previous night was now tight against his broad shoulders and beefy pecs. After several minutes, he had to admit that he wasn’t changing back; he shouted in frustration and slammed his fist into the wall. What the hell was he going to do now? Was this his new life?<br />
<br />
A part of Jensen wondered why he was trying so hard to change back. He couldn’t deny that he was a good looking man, much more attractive than he’d been when he was Jenny. He seemed to be happy and successful in his career as a personal trainer, and he was still best buds with Damon. So what if he couldn’t change back? This new life seemed like an upgrade in every sense of the word.<br />
<br />
Those thoughts were his new personality trying to take over, he told himself. The longer he stayed as Jensen, the more vivid his new memories and persona would become, and the less he’d remember from his previous life of Jenny. If he wanted his old life back, he needed to develop a plan quickly; he was literally in a fight for his life against himself.<br />
<br />
He heard the doorbell ring, bringing him out of his thoughts. That must be Damon, coming to pick him up for their shift at the gym. Jensen couldn’t bear the thought of putting the black boxers on again, so he hurried back to his room and slipped on a pair of sweatpants before heading for his front door. His mind was still racing, trying to decide what he was going to tell Damon, as he opened the door.</p>
