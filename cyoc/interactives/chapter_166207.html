<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Jen awoke to the sound of a familiar voice downstairs. Opening the closet door and rolling into a spot where she could observe from, she found Ally, her ex-girlfriend, being interviewed to fill the now-open maid position. She couldn&#39;t believe her luck! Ally had dumped her, and now, here she was again... and she&#39;d even be the new maid using Jen every day. Jen squealed in delight, but quickly wheeled herself backwards when she noticed Ally and her mother staring up to where she was hiding. She retreated back to her closet to plan her next move.<br />
<br />
Biding her time in the closet, Jen started to scheme. Ally was the one who got away to her, but now... she could make sure she never got away again. And as revenge, Jen could turn her into an appliance-maid like herself and Susan. It would be so great to use Ally as a tool... but... Jen was no longer the maid. Right now, she was just a tool as well, for Maria to use... that wouldn&#39;t do at all! She wanted to be the one using Ally!<br />
<br />
Jen realized what she must do again, she had to swap places back with Maria. Come to think of it, the body she was currently using that had been turned into a power cleaner was Maria&#39;s original body, and Maria still had Jen&#39;s original body! So that night Jen snuck into Maria&#39;s (Jen&#39;s old) room and swapped their heads back. Jen sat up in her bed, doing a quick inventory of all her body parts. Couldn&#39;t be too sure, with her new powers. Fortunately, it seemed Maria had taken good enough care of her body and all of her was finally back together. She hadn&#39;t even missed her body strangely enough, she had even completely forgotten she hadn&#39;t been using her body. The concept of bodies didn&#39;t matter too much to her now, with her new powers she could have any body she wanted.<br />
<br />
Jen was about to wheel the Maria vacuum back to the closet, when she realized a flaw in her plan. Jen had become Jen Smith again, and she was most definitely NOT the maid of the house. She wouldn&#39;t be the one using Ally (or Maria) to clean the house. She thought long and hard about this new problem and how to fix it, and finally came up with a solution. If she could combine herself with Maria in some way, maybe that would make her both Jen Smith AND Maria the maid of the Smith house.<br />
<br />
The last time she swapped roles with Maria, she had simply put her head on Maria&#39;s body... and for awhile, when she had both of their heads on, Maria acted like her sister. So all she needed to do was to incorporate Maria&#39;s head on her body somehow, but also keep full control of herself. She pulled Maria&#39;s head off of the vacuum body, and began taking her head apart. Her ears, eyes, nose, and mouth were all peeled off. Then she peeled her face off and took out her brain. If she kept Maria&#39;s brain in a body part other than her head, Maria would only exist as part of her. Jen popped off her two breasts, and split Maria&#39;s brain into the two halves, putting one in each breast, before reattaching them to her chest.<br />
<br />
To her delight, it seemed the plan had worked! She had knowledge of everything Maria did, even Maria&#39;s newly reconfigured memories. It seems with this change, Maria has always been Jen&#39;s sentient breasts, though incapable of moving, or feeling anything other than touch. But, Jen still had full control of her body. Jen felt a little bad for Maria now even though the new reality meant Maria was okay with her new life, since she had never known anything but. Taking a little pity on Maria, she took Maria&#39;s old eyes, and replaced her own nipples with them. This way, Maria could at least see. Maria seemed pleased with the new arrangement. For safekeeping Jen attached her nipples on the inside of her cheeks, so she could lick them whenever they want.<br />
<br />
Successfully having turned herself into the daughter AND maid of the Smith family, Jen wheeled the remains of Maria&#39;s old vacuum body into the closet for now, taking with her Maria&#39;s spare head parts. They could still come in handy. There was no one living as the vacuum body, but it should still work as long as it was plugged in. Jen thought about it for a moment, maybe she could simply put Ally&#39;s head down on the vacuum. But she decided no. She wanted Ally&#39;s new body to be all hers.<br />
<br />
Since there was still quite a lot of time in the night, Jen snuck down to the maid chambers, where Ally was now sleeping. The first thing she did was to pull Ally&#39;s head off and take it apart like she had Maria&#39;s, just in case Ally would wake up. She left Ally&#39;s brain in however, she didn&#39;t need to mess with that. She knew just what to do with Ally, bringing her body and head parts with her over to the laundry room. Ally would make a great washer/dryer combo. It would even be an upgrade, since the washer and dryer were currently separate. But Jen was sure she could combine them into Ally no problem. She quickly got to work disassembling the washer and dryer with her powers.<br />
<br />
The first thing she did was pull out Ally&#39;s belly, and all her insides, as well as her arms, legs and her breasts. Then she put the washer bin inside the dryer bin and stuck that whole thing into Ally&#39;s belly and chest which fortunately was easily expanded to fit it. Her body size went up to nearly triple, but her skin somehow managed to contain it. She peeled off Ally&#39;s pussy lips planning to use them as the rim of the bin like she&#39;d done with Susan&#39;s bowl. But before she did it, she remembered that the Susan toilet now operated off her cum instead of normal water. That was fine for the toilet but she didn&#39;t really want to wash the entire family&#39;s clothes with cum, as kinky as it might be. So instead she set aside Ally&#39;s pussy and took Ally&#39;s mouth stretching it around the rim. As soon as she did so Ally&#39;s mouth slammed shut startling her. But when she opened up inside Ally&#39;s mouth it was still a wide open bin. When not in use, it seemed Ally&#39;s mouth could still be used to talk, even though it was giant. She opened up Ally&#39;s mouth again, to install the lint trap at the bottom in front of her teeth. Getting a flash of brilliance, she put Ally&#39;s nose just outside the lint trap and she found she could easily reach through it to clean out the lint trap.<br />
<br />
She set the glass door of the dryer down, and grabbed Ally&#39;s legs, curling her toes around the glass until they stuck to it. The top of her legs ran over and under the glass door and connected to the side of Ally&#39;s chest, and her legs could now act as a hinge to open the lid. Now, Ally&#39;s body had been turned almost into a cube from the washer bin inside her chest. From Ally&#39;s back she hooked her throat up to the water pipeline, and hooked the power plug into her asshole, and pushed Ally into the place of the old washer/dryer.<br />
<br />
Jen still had some work to do, however. She decided Ally&#39;s head and breasts would be perfect to control the settings. She attached Ally&#39;s head and breasts along the top of her new body. The dial for the washer took the place of one nipple, and the one for the dryer took the other. Jen pocketed Ally&#39;s nipples for later use. Then on Ally&#39;s currently blank head she grabbed Ally&#39;s pussy and attached it right in the center, replacing Ally&#39;s clit with the power button. The other buttons went around her pussy in a circular fashion, reserving the &#39;open lid&#39; button for Ally&#39;s ears, working as levers. Finally, Jen put Ally&#39;s eyes on, just above her mouth, and her ears were attached to the side of each breast.<br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t want to lose track of all Ally&#39;s insides that she&#39;d just dumped on the floor, so she got a big trash bag from the kitchen and stored them all in there, keeping a tag that read &quot;Ally&quot; on it. She would keep it in her closet. Now that she was done, she yawned, finally feeling tired. She decided to go to bed for now. She&#39;d get a chance to use the Ally washing dryer tomorrow.<br />
<br />
As Jen laid down in her own bed for the first time in a few nights, she found herself a bit disappointed. She wanted to be used, too. She resolved to spend the next day making herself back into an appliance girl, but, one that was mobile so she could keep being the maid still.</p>
