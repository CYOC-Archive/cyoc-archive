<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...a chocolate bar, meticulously wrapped in a glossy golden wrapper, with the letter &quot;J&quot; imprinted on the surface. Your senses were different; you felt more compact and dense. The air around you felt cool against your chocolate exterior. You realized that being a chocolate bar meant you had no limbs, no mouth, but strangely, you had a heightened awareness of your surroundings and you can see.<br />
<br />
Your mother, having transformed all her children into various objects, packed everything, including the sandwich, soda, sandals, and beach ball, into her travel bag. Your baby sister, Lila, toddled around, her little fingers curiously poking at the different items. She was particularly drawn to you, her small hand grasping the chocolate bar and shaking it a little, probably wondering what had happened to her sibling.<br />
<br />
The journey began and the sensation of movement was a strange one. Days seemed to pass in an instant. Until, at one point, you felt a sensation of warmth enveloping you. It was your mother&#39;s hand. She had chosen to consume you.<br />
<br />
The experience of being eaten was surreal. You could sense yourself being broken apart, melted, and mixed with saliva. Before long, you found yourself traveling down a long tube, which you recognized as the esophagus. It was a swift journey, surrounded by pulsating walls, as you made your way to the stomach.<br />
<br />
Inside the stomach, you felt a swirling sensation, as the acid began breaking you down further. It was neither painful nor pleasant; it was just a process. You could sense Michel too, as the ham sandwich, experiencing a similar fate.<br />
<br />
Time passed, and you both journeyed through the intricate maze of the digestive system, being absorbed, transformed, and reassembled in countless ways. The nutrients from you and Michel were taken up into your mother&#39;s bloodstream to nourish her body, while the rest of you was compacted and prepared for elimination.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, you felt a shift in your environment, a sensation of being moved and packed tightly. It was the colon, the final stage of the digestive process.<br />
<br />
Then, on one fateful night in a hotel bathroom, your journey through the digestive system came to an end. The world around you was vastly different. The sounds were muffled, and everything had a distinct hue of blue and white. You were at the bottom of a toilet bowl.<br />
<br />
From your perspective at the bottom, you could make out the contours of your mother&#39;s figure from above. The sight of her defining hips and thighs, the tightly shaven vagina and anus… The place where you were ejected out of. You were both born from one hole and now it’s the other. This is the first time you are seeing a women’s vagina. Not only that but a whole nude view of a woman’s ass which is also your moms. A moment of reflection occurred, where you take in this erotic moment as a piece of poop meshed in with the other contents she has previously eaten.<br />
<br />
At the base of the toilet bowl lay the culmination of your mother&#39;s recent meals, including what was once you and Michel. It was a strange sight, a large, brown mass formed by her body&#39;s processes, with both of you seamlessly integrated into it. It looked just like any other bowel movement someone might have, but the knowledge that you and Michel were a part of it added an uncanny layer to the situation.<br />
<br />
From your unique vantage point, you could see her looking down between her legs. Her face, framed by her flowing hair, held an expression of amusement and perhaps a hint of satisfaction. Her eyes, full of mirth, locked onto the contents of the bowl, taking in the results of her body&#39;s digestive work. She got up from the toilet to get a better look.<br />
<br />
<br />
What she saw was a sizeable, solid stool, brown and robust. Upon closer inspection, it seemed no different from any ordinary bowel movement she&#39;d had in the past. As she pondered its vastness, she tried to recall what she had eaten over the past couple of days on what made it so big. Her brow furrowed in thought. &quot;Could it have been that extra-large plate of spaghetti from the night before?&quot; she wondered aloud, &quot;Or perhaps it was the three-course meal I indulged in the previous day?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, her eyes sparkled with realization, &quot;Ah, the chocolate bar and the ham sandwich! That&#39;s right!&quot; She chuckled, remembering how you and Michel had been transformed and consumed.<br />
<br />
With a soft chuckle, she bent slightly forward, her toned stomach now more evident. Gently placing a hand on it, she began to massage in circular motions, as if praising it for a job well done. &quot;Well, look at that,&quot; she teased, her voice echoing slightly in the bathroom. &quot;Seems like my body really knows how to handle things. Or should I say... handle you two?&quot; She laughed, clearly enjoying the playful banter she was having, even if it was mostly one-sided.<br />
<br />
She glanced at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, her slender fingers moving to gently massage her toned abdomen. &quot;Never thought I&#39;d see the day where my kids would end up like this. You two really did add something special to the mix, didn&#39;t you?&quot; she teased, the corners of her mouth turning upwards in amusement.<br />
<br />
As your mother looked back down into the toilet bowl, her brow rose in amusement. &quot;Looks like this is irrefutable evidence that women do, indeed, poop.&quot; She smirked, seemingly enjoying the moment of turning a universal truth into a moment of teasing.<br />
<br />
She continued, her voice contemplative and slightly mocking, &quot;You know, there&#39;s always been this allure around the female form. The curves, the mystique, the elegance. And now, both of you got an intimate tour, didn&#39;t you? Most people dream of being close to someone they find attractive, but you two... you got to be inside. Quite literally.&quot; She chuckled softly.<br />
<br />
Leaning slightly closer, she gave the contents of the toilet bowl another once-over. &quot;I bet you never imagined you&#39;d get to know a woman&#39;s body from the inside out. The warmth, the darkness, the rhythmic churnings of my insides. And look where you ended up. A part of me, but not in the way you&#39;d expect. You&#39;ve become a very... organic part of a woman&#39;s essence.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a more philosophical tone, she mused, &quot;Life has a way of being cyclical, doesn&#39;t it? I brought you into this world, nourished and raised you. And now, in a rather poetic twist, you&#39;ve been taken away and transformed by the very body that gave you life. From life to... well, this.&quot; She motioned with a sweeping gesture towards the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a fascinating reversal, isn&#39;t it? Usually, women give life. But today, I took it back in a different form. You&#39;ve become an intimate part of me once more, but not as children. No, you&#39;ve become something far more... basic. Proof that even the most elegant and attractive of women are still bound by nature&#39;s rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could sense Michel&#39;s consciousness next to yours, sharing in the surreal experience. There was no way to communicate, but you felt a sense of camaraderie. Both of you were in this bizarre situation together… What does she do now?</p>
