<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casseus furrowed his brow, carefully studying the teen carefully. The threat level was now more severe for the Normal.<br />
<br />
Travis Reaper was the son of Life and Death, two entities that eclipsed the gods in power. The teen was more than just a demigod, the offspring of gods, he was something that eclipsed even those mythic figures. Of all the wizards and humans, few surpassed this unassuming teen save the Catalysts. It was no wonder that Rick coveted Travis&#39;s power.<br />
<br />
Taking Travis&#39;s power was easier said than done. As Casseus assumed a defensive position, he watched as Travis darted forward at blinding speed, his shadowy cloak billowing behind him. Casseus barely had time to parry the teens scythe before at blast of raw magic sent him careening into a wall. Grunting in frustration, he spat before wiping his mouth. For now he would buy his time and hope Travis would weaken Rick.<br />
<br />
Rick yelled, the teen charging up a spell as Travis scowled at him. By this point, the young reapers eyes were pools of darkness, his shadowy cloak writhing like a some eldritch nightmare. Rick&#39;s spells were countered, Travis swatting them away with his scythe. Now it was Travis&#39;s turn, the teen releasing a bolt of greenish energy. Rick dodged, the blast shattering the concrete before using a spell to knock Travis back. Casseus now reluctantly acknowledging not only Ricks strength but his skill.<br />
<br />
Travis furrowed his brow, his opponents were certainly strong. As he looked to attack, he grunted in frustration as he found himself ensnared in a series of vines. &quot;Why resist?&quot; Demeter asked, her voice both melodic and robotic. &quot;Don&#39;t you understand? Under his rule the world will find order.&quot; Travis grit his teeth, the vines squeezing tighter around his body. &quot;I&#39;ll pass thanks,&quot; he growled.<br />
<br />
Casseus watched in awe as Travis&#39;s jaw now unhinged itself. An unworldly sound like an echo emanating from the teens gaping maw. A thick, black cloud that defied explanation billowing out of the teens mouth. Casseus couldn&#39;t quite explain it, the cloud looking both gaseous and liquid at the same time. What was undeniable though was the effect it was having on his restraints. The vines now began to wither, seeming to rot away instantly before falling away. Free once more, Travis propelled himself forward, catching Demeter by surprise as he slashed her across the abdomen.<br />
<br />
Demeter grunted, grasping her side. The wound was superficial, but the fact the goddess was harmed spoke volumes. A slow trickle of golden blood leaked from the wound, Demeter&#39;s face full of fury. Snarling the nature goddess now attacked, sending the young reaper sailing backwards. Demeter struck the teen with enough force that Travis crashed through three cars, splitting two of them in half before resting in crumpled remains of the third. For the moment, Travis seemed stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casseus,&quot; Rick exclaimed. &quot;Don&#39;t just stand there! Get him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus frowned, who did this child think he was ordering him. Still, he had a point. While he wanted nothing more than to see Rick fail, he couldn&#39;t make it to obvious. Travis was stunned, the opportunity to strike available. Casting a series of spells, the dark wizard struck. Travis grunted under the assault, his body ragdolled by the attack. Sinking to his knees, he now countered. Travis&#39;s cloak sweeping outward, striking Demeter and Casseus.<br />
<br />
Casseus grunted, the blow feeling as if he had been struck by a truck. This reapers power was amazing. In a three on one engagement, this teenager was holding his own against the Boss’s protege, a powerful dark wizard, and a goddess. Still, Casseus could tell that Travis was beginning to slow down.<br />
<br />
While Rick&#39;s allies lay prone, Rick was quick enough to avoid the attack. This was both annoying and exciting for him. Travis was proving to be far stronger than he anticipated, perhaps Rick underestimated him. That, though, only excited Rick. Already he imagined just how powerful he would become once he absorbed Travis&#39;s magic. &quot;This ends now.&quot; he bellowed.<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s ring began to glow, the teen warping his surroundings to his desires. Two massive hands now erupted from the interior of the garage, wrapping themselves around Travis. With a tell, Rick now began to slam Travis into his surroundings. The walls, the cars, the very ceiling now battered Travis as Rick slammed him into them. With a final yell, Rick smashed Travis into a wall, the teenage reaper slumping to the ground.<br />
<br />
A smug smile now spread across Rick&#39;s face. Travis was breathing but no longer moving. &quot;Finally,&quot; he sighed. &quot;that was harder than I thought it would be.&quot; He now slowly approached, gazing at Travis the way a lion would an injured antelope. Enhancing his strength, Rick now grasped Travis by the throat, hoisting him into the air. In a moment he would drain the reaper of his tremendous power and make it his own. &quot;Any last words?&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis groaned, the reaper&#39;s body racked with pain. He had nothing to say, he tried but ultimately failed to save his friends. Already he could see Ricks eyes beginning to glow as he prepared to steal Travis&#39;s power the way he stole Chenoa&#39;s. The only sound the pair heard now was a small chuckle.<br />
<br />
Turning in confusion, Travis could see Amara laughing at Rick. The demon&#39;s cat like features on full display with an unnerving smile plastered on her face. &quot;Something funny?&quot; Rick asked in annoyance. Amara continued to chuckle, coughing up blood. Slowly, Rick watched as the Mara raised her phone. Although it was a distance away, Rick could make out a name on the caller ID. Mary Elise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Amara grinned as she held up the phone. &quot;I called my mom.&quot;</p>
