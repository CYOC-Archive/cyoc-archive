<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Elle took out a plain looking medallion attached to a thin ribbon. Turning it over in her hands, she looked 
for any special markings or identifying features but found nothing that seemed to suggest any sort of 
otherworldly supernatural power. She hesitated before putting it on, whether because she thought it might be 
magic or because she was afraid it was not she didn't know. But steeling herself against her fears she slipped 
the band over her head and let the medallion rest on her chest. Fingering it idly, she waited for a spark, a 
tingle, a glimmer, anything. But no sign was forthcoming. She felt like crying at this disappointment and 
hated herself for it. When the buzzer on the dryer went off she welcomed the distraction and went, with the 
medallion still fastened around her neck, to sort the laundry. If she had stayed long enough she might have 
found the instruction manual, and then she might have found the page inside with the picture of the medallion 
on it and in doing so she might have stayed to read the following excerpt and realized the grave mistake she 
was making.
<br />
<blockquote>The Medallion of Zullo<br />
The Medallion of Zullo allows the user to take on the appearance of anyone he or she desires. In order to take 
on the appearance of a specific person, place the Medallion around ones neck, then touch an article of 
clothing belonging to the person to the Medallion. The body wearer will then transform until it is an exact 
duplicate of the person to whom the article of clothing belongs. The transformation process takes 
approximately one half hour, however the process may be sped up by prolonged contact with the article of 
clothing.
Alternatively, if an article of clothing is used that has not been worn by a specific person before, the 
wearer of the Medallion will be transformed into someone who would fit, both in terms of physical dimensions 
and personality, the article of clothing in question. After the transformation is complete, at least twelve 
hours must elapse before the Medallion can be used to return the user to their original form or take on a new 
shape. It is prudent to remember this at all times.</blockquote>
<br />
<p>But she didn't stay and she didn't read. Instead Elle walked down to the basement where the dryer was. 
Opening the dryer door, she began throwing the clothes inside a hamper. As she did, one of the shirts brushed 
the medallion. Elle felt something like an electric jolt run across her body, seemingly from the medallion. 
Looking down at it, she saw nothing amiss and dismissed it as a static shock from all the clothes she'd just 
touched. After shoving the last of the clothes into the hamper, Elle shut the dryer door and began carrying 
the hamper upstairs. Most of the clothes belonged to her oldest daughter, Alli, so she carried them up to her 
daughter's room and began sorting and folding them. As she did, her hair kept falling in front of her eyes. 
Elle normally kept her hair short but as time went on she noticed she was having to brush it away more and 
more frequently.
<br />
<p>When she felt her hair brush her shoulders she stopped folding and went into the bathroom to get a better 
look at herself. When she saw her reflection she nearly jumped in shock. The woman looking back at her did not 
look a day over 30. Elle knew the location of every wrinkle on her face, but she could not find a single one 
on the face in the mirror. Reaching up to touch her face, her hands met only smooth skin, and as she moved her 
hands away she saw they were also much smoother and less worn. Elle was excited now, and she leaned in close 
for a closer look at her youthful face. However, as she continued looking she thought that she looked younger 
than she had a few moments ago, and her hair seemed even longer. When she had first looked her hair, normally 
only a few inches long, had been just brushing her shoulders. Now it hung a few inches below them. As she 
watched it lengthened a few fractions of an inch.
<br />
<p>She looked up, hoping to see another few years taken off her face, and was not disappointed as she watched 
her features tighten. Her excitement turned to puzzlement however as she noticed her eyes changing from their 
normal brown to a light blue. Elle guessed she looked around 25 now, but not like she had at 25. It almost 
looked like her, close enough that the face could belong to a sister. It didn't make any sense to her, until 
she remembered the what had happened in the laundry room. This hadn't started until after the medallion had 
shocked her, which had been when the shirt had brushed against it. It had been her daughter's shirt, and her 
daughter had blue eyes.
<br />
<p>The changes began accelerating as Elle began nearing her teens. Her stomach sucked in and began tightening 
until it was smooth and taut. Her arms and legs toned and shaped before her eyes. She felt her breasts push 
into her bra as they firmed and lost all signs of sag until they stuck out proudly on her chest. Her pants 
were stretched tight against her hips by the swelling bubble of her rear. Her face continued its backward 
aging along with the rest of her body until she found herself looking in the mirror at the spitting image of 
Alli, her 16 year old daughter. 
<br />
<p>Elle stared at her, or rather her daughter's, reflection in the mirror in shock until...</p>
