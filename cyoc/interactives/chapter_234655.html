<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking into Caldrak prison reminded Luke of his days on the assembly line. A slow procession of bits and pieces surrounded by workmen who poked, prodded, and toyed with the machinery. Only, in this scenario, Luke wasn’t making cars, and he wasn’t one of the workers.<br />
<br />
He was the bits and pieces.<br />
<br />
Luke entered Caldrak prison with 13 others, each of varying height and weight. If they were all lined up with specific criteria, be it musclemass, or shoesize, Luke would be placed in the middle almost every time. He sat in the middle of the prison bus, gazing out from the shuttered windows to catch a brief flash of sunlight whenever the bus turned a corner. His wrists began to ache in his chains, and the scratchy fabric of his orange jumpsuit was making his neck turn red.<br />
<br />
He didn’t look out of the window with despair, however, rather with an intense focus. He needed a quick distraction to repel the grizzly reality around him, and so he played a game. Who is the best-looking guy here? Luke often played this game when he was in new environments, and it gave him some entertainment even in the darkest of times. He scanned the bus for potential candidates.<br />
<br />
Luke saw across the bus from him, sitting a few rows in front, was a nervous middle-aged man. He was shaking and had sweat all along the back of his neck and bald patch. Luke prefers a man with confidence. Next candidate.<br />
<br />
He noticed a tall, skinny man sit in the front row silently sobbing to himself. The man’s head was in his hands. Luke likes some meat on the bones. Next candidate.<br />
<br />
He turned behind him and saw a short young lad stare intently at the chains by his feet. This was it; the winner of Luke’s little game. The lad was well-built and had a very cute face. Freshly trimmed sideburns were smeared along his smooth face. <br />
<br />
The lad tapped his foot nervously. Every inmate on that bus shared that increasing sense of anxiety as the Caldrak prison gates drew nearer, but not Luke. <br />
<br />
This wasn’t his first time in prison.<br />
<br />
The gates led to a large courtyard made of gravel and neglect. Luke could hear men cheering and whistling from outside as the bus parked in the centre. He heard some fragments of conversations, with the word “Bunny” tossed around the most. The men’s voices were low and booming. Switching off the engine the bus driver pulled a lever and the doors swung open. He looked like a nice old man, who avoided looking at all the inmates in the eye.<br />
<br />
Luke’s eyes widened as a prison guard stepped onto the bus. The fact that it was a prison guard wasn’t what surprised Luke, rather it was the man’s stature. He was tall. Very tall. And muscular. As he stepped on the bus leant slightly to one side under his weight. A full head of combed-back blonde hair, and piercing blue eyes complimented his incredibly handsome face. His boxy jawline hung over a thick neck and Adam’s apple. His uniform looked well-kempt, and tight around the arms, chest, and crotch. Luke could tell the man had an impressive physique. He found a new winner for his game.<br />
<br />
The guard tucked his hat under his armpit and scanned the inmates before looking at the snivelling tall man in the front row.<br />
<br />
“Right, you lot, with me,” he said with an authoritative tone, “I want you in order of how you’re sitting, so you come first.”<br />
<br />
He pointed at the tall man who slowly stood up and followed him out of the van. The cheering of the men outside erupted as they began to chant something Luke couldn’t quite make out. A few inmates followed the man, then Luke followed them, and the young lad behind him followed after. <br />
<br />
They all emerged from the van to meet the blinding light of the sun, the choking dust of the courtyard air, and the roaring cheers of two-hundred or so inmates. They whistled at the pack of new arrivals, catcalling and gesturing for them to come closer. Some of them were vigorously shaking the feeble wire fence that separated them from the fresh faces. Most of them were stamping their feet, pounding the chest, and shouting “BUNNY!” in a slow, foreboding rhythm. Their voices were deafening.<br />
<br />
Luke gasped at the sight. Whilst it was intimidating, like the guard he was taken aback at the inmates’ sizes. The smallest one must’ve stood no shorter than 6ft5, with the tallest ones nearer the back reaching 8ft! Their bodies were all varying levels of muscular, but their uniforms were just as tight. Luke couldn’t help but look at the rock-hard appendages most of them had swinging between their legs. They towered over him and the rest of the new inmates, even the skinny man at the front of the procession who was extra jumpy.<br />
<br />
“Come here Bunny! I’ll take good care of ya!” one inmate yelled at him.<br />
<br />
They were all reaching for the new arrivals, with some successful in poking, prodding, and toying with them.<br />
<br />
“Right men!” yelled the guard over the noise, “march!”<br />
<br />
He led Luke and the rest of the new arrivals, slowly and painstakingly, across the courtyard, and towards the entrance to the prison. The men around them continued their shouts, trying as hard as they could to get their attention. <br />
<br />
“Damn, you’ll make the perfect Bunny!” said one inmate as he was able to reach and slap the younger man behind Luke right on his ass. The lad yelped and jumped on the spot as the inmates around him laughed.<br />
<br />
“Too rough for you?”<br />
“Better get used to it Bunny boy!”<br />
“You can be my bunkmate sexy!”<br />
<br />
The man began to panic. Tears formed in his eyes and his breathing became erratic. Luke turned to see him stare back with a unblinking, quivering stare.<br />
<br />
“I don’t belong here. I’m not supposed to be here,” he said to Luke.<br />
<br />
The two stared at each other, but was broken off quickly when an inmate started humping the fence with his bulge.<br />
<br />
“Share a bunk with me Bunny and we’ll go all. Night. LONG!”<br />
<br />
The young man turned around and saw the gates of Caldrak prison.<br />
<br />
“I don’t belong here,”<br />
<br />
The gates were still open.<br />
<br />
“Im not supposed to be here.”<br />
<br />
And nothing was in his way.<br />
<br />
“I want to go home!”<br />
<br />
The guard at the front of the procession turned around and quickly reached for the radio by his waist.<br />
<br />
“97-82! Runner by the main gates. Immediate code green. Code GREEN!” he yelled into the radio.<br />
<br />
Luke watched the man sprint with chained feet towards the prison gates. His desperate waddle to freedom was met with further cheers and gasps from the huge inmates.<br />
<br />
“You’ve done it now Bunny!”<br />
“You ain’t getting out that way!”<br />
“They’re gonna Fountain you first!”<br />
<br />
Luke looked up at the prison walls and noticed the doors to a watchtower swing open. A guard climbed out wielding some sort of gun. He pointed it straight at the young man and, once the lad had made a fair distance towards the gates, fired.<br />
<br />
But there was no gunshot.<br />
<br />
Instead of a bullet, a dart carrying a vial of green liquid flew straight towards the man, and jabbed him in his neck. The dart was the size of a test tube, and as it pierced the man’s skin, the green liquid was pumped straight into him. He cried out in pain and fell to the ground as the inmates around him cheered as if a footballer had scored a goal.<br />
<br />
“Fountain!”<br />
“Fountain!”<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
<br />
They all chanted. The young man reached for the dart and pulled it out, throwing it as far away as he could. He looked around, confused at the chants, until his attention was pulled elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Something was squirming in his jumpsuit. In his crotch, he felt his cock move as if it had a life of its own. He gently placed one hand on it and pulled it away quickly when he realised; it was growing. His cock grew rock-hard and formed a sizeable bulge, as it continued to slither further down his leg. In a panic, he went back up on his feet and continued running.<br />
<br />
Luke couldn’t believe what he was looking at. The lad’s bulge grew, and grew, and grew. Eight inches. Ten. A foot long. A foot and a half. Getting longer and longer as it snaked further below his knee. Two feet long. His balls were swelling bigger and bigger. Three feet long. His jumpsuit looked incredibly tight but he kept running. He was so close to the prison gates. So close to freedom. The inmates kept chanting, getting faster and louder.<br />
<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
“No! I don’t belong here!”<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
<br />
However, before he could make it all the way, his cock grew so long and so thick he inevitably tripped on it and fell to the ground. The inmates cheered. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” he cried out.<br />
<br />
He laid on his back with his legs apart. His cock surpassed four foot, and was so crammed into his jumpsuit it started to hurt. He frantically went to unzip it open as the inmates around him ogled.<br />
<br />
“Let the monster out!”<br />
“Yeah come on! Let’s see it Fountain!”<br />
<br />
The young man unzipped his jumpsuit open and pulled his cock out with all of his strength. It shot straight up and smacked him in the face. His balls slid out and collapsed on the floor. The lad was panting for air at the sight of his cock standing up high above his waist like a thick, meaty flagpole.<br />
<br />
And it kept growing.<br />
<br />
Five feet.<br />
<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
<br />
Six feet.<br />
<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
<br />
Seven feet.<br />
<br />
“I’m not supposed to be—“<br />
<br />
Ten feet.<br />
<br />
“Holy FUCK!”<br />
<br />
His balls kept growing bigger and bigger as his cock dwarfed him in size. Fifteen feet. He couldn’t move. His cock was so big and heavy all he could do was lie there and accept his fate. Twenty feet. His balls were the size of bean bags. His mind slowly grew numb as did his pleas for help. <br />
<br />
“Oh my god,” he said.<br />
<br />
Twenty-five feet.<br />
<br />
He started moaning.<br />
<br />
Twenty-seven feet.<br />
<br />
“Here it comes boys! FOUNTAIN!”<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
“FOUNTAIN!”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!”<br />
<br />
Thirty feet.<br />
<br />
“OH MY GOOOOOODDDDDD!”<br />
<br />
He cried out with what strength he had left as he felt his balls tense and his cock shoot out a torrent of cum. It sprayed upwards like the blowout of an oil drill before falling in heaps on top of him. The men around him roared with laughter and applause.<br />
<br />
“Let it all out Fountain!”<br />
<br />
The young man kept moaning as he bathed in his loads. He writhed about in the liquid, reaching for his shaft and hugging it for dear life. It was so thick he arms couldn’t reach all the way around it. His hair was drenched. His clothes were soaked. The ground around him was flooded. Some of his seed hit a few inmates, who licked up as much of it as they could. It was a spectacular display; one no stranger to Caldrak had ever seen before.<br />
<br />
“Runner neutralised,” a low voice came from the prison guard’s radio, “we’ll take care of him. Continue with the procession.”<br />
<br />
“Right men, MARCH!” yelled the guard.<br />
<br />
Luke was stunned. Stunned at the size of the man’s cock. Stunned at the men cheering and whooping. Stunned at the prison guard nonchalantly turning back around and leading the inmates closer to the main doors. <br />
<br />
His mind raced with all sorts of questions and thoughts. The calm, level-headed façade had gone. He was now sharing the same level of anxiety as the rest of the new inmates. He heard some of the men around him yell, their words etched into his brain as he stepped into the prison complex.<br />
<br />
“Ain’t no one getting out of Caldrak, bunny! You’re mine and my cock’s forever!”</p>
