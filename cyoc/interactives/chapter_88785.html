<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok Muggle tell us about yourself&quot; the professor asked.<br />
<br />
The policeman stared at the class, obviously a little confused. He looked around at the grinning teenagers siting at their desks looking at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m officer Douglas. I&#39;m 28 years old. I&#39;ve worked in the force for 5 years&quot;<br />
<br />
He stopped at turned to the professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I doing here again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the last thing you remember officer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. I went to work as usual today and I….<br />
Now I&#39;m here. Where am i?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your at a wizard class. Where the students learn magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cop looked at the smiling faces and back at the professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this a joke? There are no wizards. What&#39;s this all about.?&quot; He was definitely feeling uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I just explained to the class,  today we are demonstrating how to control and humiliate the Muggles. I brought you gentleman here because you all have some sort of sense of manly pride. You as a police officer are a symbol of authority and power so I thought bringing you down would be a good example.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting at the front of class behind the policeman also facing the students were 5 other confused looking men. One was wearing a business suit. One was a young jock no older then the teens in the class, one looked like a gang member . The other 2 just looked like regular guys. <br />
<br />
The cop looked annoyed. &quot;Hey come on? How did I get here? This has gone far enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
The professor pulled out a wand a waved it at the police man. &quot;Alright class the first thing we will do to  break down his will a little is to make him tell us some personal things. We will make him reveal details that one doesn&#39;t normally share with strangers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So officer tell us about your body. You look well built in that nice neat uniform of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I work out often.&quot;  the confused man answered.<br />
&quot;I need to stay in shape for my job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Describe your body in detail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i&#39;m 180 cm and 75 Kg. I have dark curly hair. Its from my Italian heritage. Im pretty lean and muscular. I have some body hair. I have a large uncircumcised penis&quot; The class laughed at this last remark and the cop looked quite surprised at what he just said. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you trim your pubes?&quot; the professor asked.<br />
<br />
The cop looked annoyed but then answered<br />
&quot;A little I guess. Every now and then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have much hair around your anus?&quot;<br />
<br />
The confused man again looked at the snickering crowd <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Ah… normal amount I guess&quot; the embarrassed man answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you straight or gay. &quot;I&#39;m straight!&quot; the cop answered immediately. <br />
<br />
&quot;When is the last time you ejaculated?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had sex with my girlfriend last night.&quot; he answered<br />
<br />
The cop was turning quite red but he made no attempt to leave and he obviously didn&#39;t know why he was answering these questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like to masturbate? &quot;<br />
<br />
The class giggled a the cops embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I Do. Doesn&#39;t everyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im asking the questions here!&quot; The professor replied sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So officer, do you consider yourself to be tough man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I&#39;m pretty tough. I don&#39;t take shit from anyone. I guess people are intimidated by me. I need to be tough and respected for my job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok officer how would you like to take off you clothes for the class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;m not going to strip in front of a bunch of teenagers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why not. You seem proud of your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that would be indecent and against the law! my job is to uphold the law. I only take off my clothes for my girlfreind and in  the showers at work. And in the gym&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked around again.<br />
&quot;Also there are young ladies here.&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok class so as you can see the muggle is proud of his status as a man and of his place in society which allows him to be tough and in control of others. His uniform represents the power of the state which supports his sense of power. Clothes in general give people a sense of dignity and marks their status in society. So the first thing we do to break him down is have him remove the symbol of power which is his uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look buddy, I don&#39;t know what your talking about but Im not taking off my uniform&quot;<br />
As he was saying that the class started to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? the cop asked looking around at the giggling crowd, He then felt something weird. He looked down and saw that his uniform was fading away. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!!?&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
The handsome young man was now standing in his boxer briefs in front of the class. He blushed deeply and looked around. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to my uniform?&quot; he asked angrily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now class look at this man. He is quite handsome. Broad shoulders, narrow waste. he has some hair on his chest and abdomen. You can now see his legs are quite hairy. He is a good specimen of virility and manliness yet he is still quite uncomfortable being so exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer please tell us why you don&#39;t like to stand here in your underwear showing off your muscular build to the class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look professor or whatever the fuck you are. Give me back my uniform!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooow&quot; the the class mocked, laughing. They knew it wasn&#39;t a good idea to disrespect their teacher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok class so you can see that despite a demonstration of power that he obviously can not understand. He challenges my authority.&quot; This is an example of the man trying to regain his dignity. Which I will not allow him.<br />
<br />
He turned back to the cop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok young man, because you have shown disrespect and lack of understanding of your status in this room, I&#39;m going to punish you by making you get completely naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you! The angry cop barked. Im not stripping for anybody!&quot;<br />
<br />
The professor waved his wand and the cop immediately scratched at his crotch. Then his ass. he started to scratch furiously all around his underwear. The class roared with laughter as the poor man danced around scratching. His underpants where obviously the source of the discomfort. <br />
<br />
The other confused men sitting behind him looked scared. <br />
<br />
Finally Officer Douglas couldn&#39;t take it anymore. He grabbed his underwear and ripped it from his body and threw it to the floor.<br />
<br />
The ashamed man stood there in front of the class with his hands clutched over his his hairy crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;There you are officer. As naked as a little baby.  How does that make you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
He blushed as he looked angrily into the smiling faces of the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel… I feel humiliated&quot; The man answered still not knowing why he was answering these questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok class, you see the man is quite embarrassed to stand naked in front of us.<br />
So who has done their reading and can make a suggestion of what we should do to him next to make him understand his status here?&quot;</p>
