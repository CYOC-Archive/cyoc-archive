<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not 5 minutes after Ryan and Kristy left, Jeremy's nose twitched as she hid under the couch, her nose picking up the scents of the tomcat all around her, he did live there after all. She shifted under the couch, rubbing herself against the carpeting, causing her to purr uproariously. She was growing more and more aroused by the scents around her. Her instincts were proving to be more powerful than her human male mind. She started to crawl out from under the couch, yowling loudly in frustration.<br />
<br />
Her yowls were long, loud and changing of tones, the most annoying sounds that you could imagine coming from a cat. Though it does what nature had intended, it was getting the attention of the tomcat in the house. She was moving around the living room following the scents, her instincts were in full control at this point, the human male had lost. She eventually came up nose to nose with the male cat. Purring she rubbed him with the side of her head with a small headbutt against his chin, rubbing herself up against him.<br />
<br />
She pressed her body against his as she moved along side him. She was purring loudly as her tail curled around his front and neck. The tom stuck his nose down near her rear and sniffed lightly. He watched her for a long few moments until she had laid down. Jeremy lay panting and yowling still as the tomcat sniffed at her hind end, his maw open making a face a tell tale sign that the male was smelling a female in heat.<br />
<br />
The tom sat there a long few moments, watching Jeremy, until it looked like she was going to move. Jeremy tried getting up but the tom suddenly pounced on her, biting the side of her neck, pushing her back down to the floor. He lowered himself to a near sitting position. Jeremy YOWLED loudly when he did this, she squirmed under him. She felt something warm and wet enter her body. Jeremy's mind came back for a moment through the fog of arousal and heat, crying out as he was violated trying to get away but not getting very far.<br />
<br />
She yowled, beginning to purr as she felt him slide into her, rocking gently as he pinned her body down against the floor. She could feel his barbs raking against the inside of her new vaginal channel. She didn't know anything about feline anatomy or the purposes of anything.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Jeremy the barbs were doing what they were meant to, they were encouraging her body to release eggs for the suitable mate, as she ovulated her eggs for the tom the magic powers she was granted began waning. Her power was being drained from her and being fed into Chester. By the time she ovulated the sixth egg out of her ovaries her powers here completely gone and given to the tomcat riding her.<br />
<br />
The tom that was on her back, kept her down. His rocking weren't much or hard, but it was enough to get the job done. His barbs erecting on the end of his maleness. His ears pulling back as he presses himself up into the female firmly, his scrotum pressed against her round vulva firmly. He kept his bite on her neck firmly as he began spraying his seed up into his new female, marking and claiming her as his mate! His barbs were flared holding his member steady and wedged inside Jeremy's cervix, spraying his seed directly into her uterus.<br />
<br />
Jeremy and Chester stayed together in their post climactic stance for about 3 minutes before the tom pulled out of her roughly and leaped away. Jeremy turning and swatting at him because it kind of hurt. She hissed and sat down to clean herself. Jeremy's mind started to come back into control as she could now taste and smell Chester all over her body.<br />
<br />
Jeremy was thinking, &quot;oh god oh god, he mated with me, he... shot his seed in me... He's gonna give me kittens!&quot; She yowled again when she was finished cleaning herself. She looked at Chester for a moment, thinking to herself, &quot;But I guess it's too late now.. If it's going to happen I might as well try to enjoy it.&quot; She figured. Laying down she lifted her hind end, lifting her tail to Chester, presenting to the tomcat. <br />
<br />
Chester didn't need any more of an invitation and mounted his mate again, and three more times over the next hour, sealing Jeremy's fate to being nothing more than a female calico. He's taken her powers and now given her a full litter of kittens making her transformation into a female cat permanent.<br />
<br />
After an hour of mating with Jeremy, Chester could tell that she was pregnant by the scent she was giving off. Cleaning himself while Jeremy was cleaning herself, he began to get hungry. The cat's didn't know the powers were transferred. Chester started to pad towards the kitchen and his next meal. On the way there...</p>
