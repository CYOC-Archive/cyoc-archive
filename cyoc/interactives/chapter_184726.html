<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stone&#39;s point made sense - if she was going to start sharing her gift with anyone, Siobahn seemed like the best candidate. Certainly, the doctor couldn&#39;t deny how thrilling it was to imagine her very physical makeup being changed and altered by contact with the creature skittering around her feet. &quot;You&#39;re right... I uh... I just... wasn&#39;t expecting it, so soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;It scares you instinctually.&quot;</i> Siobahn couldn&#39;t even deny the assertion. The small alien organism crawling towards her was roughly the size and configuration of a scorpion, covered in the same black skin and armored plating as Stone, complete with a bony tail swishing behind. It called to mind ancient instincts to avoid danger, a subcouncious sense of revulsion stemming from her ancestors suffering pain and death from such creatures. <br />
<br />
Which was exactly the sort of thing that she needed to move past. Another artifact of ancient humanity that only served as a detriment to her now. Taking in a deep breath, she let it out in an exhale, before silently nodding and kneeling down to offer her hand to the alien creature. There was a click that seemed rather pleased before it hopped up onto her arm, the little feet scurrying up her body and around to her back, right at the base of her neck.<br />
<br />
A gasp of shock left her mouth at the feeling of two small pincers digging her back, puncturing all the way into her spinal column. For a moment, her entire body seemed to go completely numb - and then, suddenly, her mind exploded with new sensations as the symbiote&#39;s nervous system connected with her own. She could feel everything it felt, recognizing the movements of its muscles as her own muscles. Neurologically speaking, they were already part of the same system, feelings and sensory input being shared among them. <br />
<br />
The other feet began to dig in, and as she felt her muscle and skin being parted, she could at the same time feel the little creature... melting, for lack of a better word. Its cells seemed to break down not long after penetrating into her body, diffusing throughout her - throughout them. Absorbing into her, becoming well and truly a part of her body. In mere moments, the creature had completely submerged itself into her back, the tissue twisting and reforming as the dispersed cells began to multiply and convert her own human physiology into something entirely-<br />
<br />
No. Not entirely. It wasn&#39;t replacing her. It was blending with her, entwining itself with her at a genetic level. She had expected pain, maybe even feared that it might take her over, but that wasn&#39;t happening. It actually felt... warm. Like the most comfortable blanket in history was wrapped around her. With every bit of her anatomy that the blending spread to, she felt nothing but total compassion, and a desire for closeness, for company, for a permanent union with something that had only her greatest self-interest in mind.<br />
<br />
Internally, she could feel her organs shifting around, rearranging - and the exterior was not lacking in changes. Her skin tingled as it rapidly began to darken, shifting to an ashen color not far off from Stone&#39;s, as pure black as the hair that now fell around her shoulders. One hand slid over the opposite forearm, curiously exploring the rougher texture, and she gasped as she felt a bulge building up. Bony plates, hardier than even the thickest depleted uranium armor, rapidly built up on her arms, legs, and torso, providing a further sense of safety. She couldn&#39;t help but indulge in a moment of grasping at her chest as the plates appeared there - and to her delight, she sensed a certain flexibility on the plates there and on her groin, an especially appealing factor considering the way her chest seemed to gain fatty mass beneath the armor.<br />
<br />
The transformation only became more pleasurable as she moved her hands to just above her rear, giving the cheeks a squeeze as she felt her sping lengthening. A hole was poked out of her shirt and lab coat as a slender tail tipped with a razor-sharp blade ripped out of her backside. God, why did she even have these clothes on anymore? Without a second thought, she hurriedly ripped off every article covering her body, finding that her own strength had been enhanced considerably. She felt as if she could crush steel in her hands; if Stone too possessed this much raw power, then her containment had only ever been a way of letting the humans feel more safe. She could have escaped at any time.<br />
<br />
But she hadn&#39;t. She had waited, Siobahn realized this now. She had been biding her time, holding out until someone kind enough to free her had come along. The symbiote had carried with it the incredible gratitude and affection the captain felt. Along with these feelings, it also brought memories - a flood of images and sensations from a thousand different alien landscapes, from places she could have never even conceived of. Life that never would have been recognized as such on Earth, stretching back practically to the dawn of existence, and passed along through genetic memories through endless generations.<br />
<br />
A grin of razor-sharp teeth was on the doctor&#39;s face as she rose to her feet, height enhanced by both a lengthening of her body and the three-inch, stilleto-like blades emerging from her heels. She had well and truly become a blending of human and alien, just like Stone, golden eyes burning with wonder as they connected with the captain&#39;s own glowing gaze. She could feel their minds touching instantly, a bond far beyond their previous telepathic communication formed in milliseconds. <br />
<br />
Siobahn was the first to reach out, taking an excited first step into a larger world. <i>This is...</i><br />
<br />
<i>Beyond words.</i> Stone smiled, stepping forward and putting her hands onto the altered scientist&#39;s shoulders. <i>We have little time to escape, but don&#39;t worry. Once we are free, I will help you to understand your incredible new form...</i> Her eyes pulsed with something wickedly delightful as her tail trailed up Siobahn&#39;s leg. <i>And to explore pleasures you could have never dreamed of.</i><br />
<br />
Her heart was beating ever faster in her chest. The affection shared between them - she wanted nothing more than to drag Stone to the floor and find a thousand breathtaking ways in which to express it. But she was right. Stone&#39;s release would be noted any time now, and for as powerful as she felt, there was no telling what kind of insane tools they had to effect containment. The half-alien duo would need to leave, quickly, and make their way someplace they could lay low and figure out their next move.</p>
