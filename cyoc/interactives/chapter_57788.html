<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author's Note: Welcome to when you have two to three weeks worth of work in retail <br />
backed up in the holiday season. I originally meant for this to be one of my old epic posts. <br />
But other responsibilities came up.) <br />
<br />
Glendale had become a place with the magic of an entire planet condensed into a single <br />
population center, powerful enough to rewrite reality itself by a simple inverse triggering <br />
of the basic law of cause and effect. And for those whose families had spent generations <br />
there, that magic had became an inescapable part of their very being. <br />
<br />
As Marie-Elize had said, those for whom the magic had integrated into themselves: their <br />
magic now existed independently of the game.  This included the Leoman cascade, Penny <br />
and Amy's gift, Alice and her half-sisters/cousins, the down right -frightening- amount of <br />
power Marie-Eliza now contained, and of course the magic that ran through the Omegas of <br />
the pack. <br />
<br />
The Omega's children's genes did not carry their parents' mutation, but if the children's -<br />
magical- heredity resulted in a mutation similar to their parents, the curse would have <br />
nothing to do with it.  And while DNA testing could pick up traits handed down via DNA, <br />
magical heredity was not something geneticists knew what to look for or if it could even BE <br />
detected that way. <br />
<br />
If Cansandra, Lilly, Laura, Zulema, Giselle, and Gretchen mutated due to the magic that <br />
came from their parents, continuing the line of Shiva wolves started centuries ago, the <br />
game's continued or discontinued existence would not play a role. <br />
<br />
As for Jay, Pence, Toni and Paula, they were abandoned pups, and were Anne's adopted <br />
children and not part of the Shiva line.  Their major concern would be when Anne's <br />
pregnancy became impossible to deny and they'd wonder if their mother had tired of <br />
having pups not related to her by blood and Anne having to carefully explain to her <br />
children that family was NOT just about blood.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Marie Cruz looked at the three witches. <br />
<br />
Gaal, she was blond, was wearing a 17th century century red dress with a black hooded <br />
cape.  <br />
<br />
Golgatha, A woman who in life wore an emerald dress and hood identical to Gaal's with <br />
long long black hair that reached her ankles,  and half her face gone rather like Marie's <br />
whose own face still bore the claw marks of the thing that had torn out one eye. <br />
<br />
The youngest of the witch, Gomorrah. Wearing a brown hooded cape, and ruffled black <br />
dress with pearl jewelry her blond hair done in many different and seemingly random <br />
braids like a mad child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gita, Goldwyn, Griselle...&quot; Marie said apologetically, &quot;I'm sorry, I failed you. I couldn't save <br />
you. I couldn't help you. I couldn't be the friend you wanted, nor more importantly could I <br />
be the friend you NEEDED. In spite of everything, I want you know that I'm sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You sicken me.&quot; Gaal said, &quot;You just want to place yourself on your high moral pedestal, so <br />
you can look down and pass judgement on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Using our grandmother's bones, you spineless coward.&quot; Gomorrah said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your 'apology' is something you're using to make yourself feel superior and make you <br />
think you're superior to those around you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sister Marie Cruz left them be without saying another word, leading Father Draco to keep <br />
an eye on them and their familiars. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza explained, &quot;Marie Cruz would try several times to return to Europe to resume <br />
her life as a killer for the church, but death's geass prevented her from ever getting far. <br />
She was -bound- to look after the witches victims until they could look after themselves.  <br />
And being a divine messenger, Azrael's geass was unbreakable. However, he left one <br />
loophole which as death he had to.&quot; <br />
<br />
Betty said it first, &quot;The geass wouldn't prevent them from dying or being killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza nodded, looking sad at this fact. <br />
<br />
Maddex, &quot;So in the end, the 'angel' was just as bad as the witches... using mind control to <br />
force people to do what he wanted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza, &quot;Don't just something that isn't one of the races of Man, by the laws of Man's <br />
standards. Nor was he part of any society and thus under any social contract. And what he <br />
did, he did actually because of Joella... he knew, because he was there at the same time, <br />
that Running-Bear was dying... and that Joella had now lost her grandfather and her <br />
mothers, all in the same day.  True, Joella wasn't alone, every Witch Pride member along <br />
with Benjamin's family, their human servants and familiars, and of course Free, all shifted <br />
their undying unconditional fidelity they had towards the witches to Joella, she was their <br />
sole heir after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty, &quot;Poor little rich girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't precisely call her rich, though any normal child put in her position would have <br />
been spoiled rotten. Joella being an idealized human wasn't in danger of that. But the <br />
Hunters DID provide her the emotional help she needed, and the help the former mob <br />
would need having no parents to be returned to unlike the rest. Of course.... the REAL <br />
danger was that some of those children would now have the gift... something Linus would <br />
have to teach them very carefully NOT to abuse... and teach them something that had been <br />
UN-taught out of them by the witches: self control and discipline!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The griffon gargoyle Library noticed that this morning his life companion, the dark gray <br />
she-wolf Molly wasn't naked. 'Okay, maybe she is naked by human, dragon, and felman <br />
standards... but-' &quot;Molly, what are you wearing?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; She looked at him and then lifted her giant paw to the red ribbon around her neck. <br />
&quot;Well, my daughter-in-law wears a red ribbon around one ear. So I thought I'd try it out <br />
for myself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Library examined her, &quot;It looks beautiful on you.&quot; Library for one moment allowed himself <br />
the fantasy of performing the taboo and offering Molly to live on and on with him as a <br />
female gargoyle via soul transference, and shuddered and rejected the idea of doing <br />
something so deviant. If other gargoyles wanted to break the base laws of nature by doing <br />
so, let them, they had nothing to do with him or Molly, but he'd have no part in it! He <br />
quickly changed the subject as he still sat on his perch in the library's entry way as the <br />
nine foot tall she wolf had brought another box from the basement. Library saw what she <br />
took out. <br />
<br />
&quot;I still think that spear is a fake.&quot; He said to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think it's real?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the story of one of the hunters wielding a spear is absurd, in particular when the <br />
one who was supposed to use it was a nun!&quot; <br />
<br />
Molly examined the spear, the tip still caked with trace amounts of dried blood. &quot;This is <br />
supposedly the one she used in that damned duel to the death the witches forced on <br />
them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The witches who were just chaotic and not really evil. I wonder if they would have <br />
unleashed this game on Glendale if they knew all the damage it would cause.&quot; <br />
<br />
Molly shrugged, &quot;A question to the ages... 'You, kill who means the most to you. And you, <br />
fight her to the death at your absolute full -potential- as if you were groomed to be a <br />
killer like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You KNOW Molly that we only know they said that via the game of telephone. And you <br />
know inaccurate that is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt after what the witches did to them the hunters were in a hurry to write down word <br />
or word what happened... &quot;<br />
<br />
Molly, in spite of Library's words that spear story was likely made up to make the hunters <br />
more 'bad-ass' to more modern culture, she placed it on display next to the hunter leader's <br />
plague mask. <br />
<br />

<br />
Martha dreamed of dancing on the moon and across the planet with her husbands. And <br />
her sister wives and herself dividing like one-celled life forms until they were a normal set <br />
of sub packs. <br />
<br />
Martha awoke early, in the arms of her husbands save Maddex who she did not even <br />
question why he was not did she question, nor did Whitney question, where Cansandra and <br />
Lilly were, nor had they for several days. <br />
<br />
Martha knew the mourning process did not work on a time table, and she couldn't force <br />
it... but life had to go on, and the pride had to return to school eventually, and the pups <br />
had to resume their home lessons eventually. <br />
<br />
But that day, was not quite today. <br />
<br />
Bart, Jenny, Kevin, Marcy all awoke at her loud stern voices. No one questions where the <br />
glass pups were. Jay, Pence, Toni, Paula, Giselle, Gretchen, Laura, and Zulema also awoke. <br />
<br />
Martha found that Amy wasn't in her bed, but there was a small note next to it saying that <br />
she had gotten up early and Martha shouldn't worry about her. While Bart and Jenny were as <br />
smart as collage graduates, Amy's emotional maturity was that of women many times her <br />
age. <br />
<br />
'Pity...' Martha thinks seeing Zelipe struggling to get up and being helped by Bart, Jay and <br />
Pence. 'I wish Amy wasn't in such a hurry to grow up, you don't ever get to be a child <br />
again, and the time as an adult is much much longer... '<br />
<br />
Martha led the pups to the dinning room, where Wendy, Jessica, Rose and Betty were all on <br />
schedule for breakfast duty due to the Omegas being spread thin by the injured pride and <br />
packmates. <br />
<br />
Martha barely glanced at the five statues in the man entry way, but she did think, 'Did the <br />
purple statue of the goddess of dawn always look like she was smiling like that?' She didn't <br />
question seeing the moon and food goddess hugging. <br />
<br />
Joy met her right at the door of the dinning room. Martha noted that 'O' was sleeping and J <br />
and Y were the ones awake. While many of the pack felt it easier to just punch the three <br />
together as one person, Marth as a fellow Omega was able to appreciate that J, O, and Y <br />
were independent conscious beings. 'In their own way, they along with In, Gr, and Id, more <br />
normal than  myself and the other Omegas... our heads are all wired to one brain, they have <br />
separate identities, which is actually how people like us in nature are supposed to be...'  <br />
Some Siamese twins did indeed bear a resemblance to Martha and her Omegas Shiva <br />
wolves, but their heads were all separate identities... <br />
<br />
J and Y said together, &quot;Prime-Omega-Martha! ... Good morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning J, Y.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We waited until morning, we'll take over your looking over the pups for now if you wish,&quot; J <br />
said, and Y picked up,  &quot;But one of the pride members wishes to speak with you. She <br />
wanted to last night, but O told her that it was best to wait until morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... why does she wish to speak with me?&quot; One of Martha's head said with the silver <br />
shiva wolf's other head and her first head's third eye kept an eye on the pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't say,&quot; J replied, &quot;But she did seem rather interested in you after we explained <br />
our dance with you is how we, O, In, Gr, and Id were all born.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Martha said lowly. &quot;I'll speak with her... they are our guests after all, the pride. The <br />
two of you keep your eyes pealed on the pups. They losses have effect them. And be <br />
doubly sure to fetch the pride pups staying with us for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Omega Prime.&quot; J and Y nodded and bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;What was the pride member's name?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Mal'akh Bialyk.&quot; Y explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Y.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As my duty commands me Prime Omega.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha hugged each of the pups before going to the massive room converted into the <br />
recovery space for their battle mangled pack and pride members.  They were currently <br />
watching Faulty Towers on the TV screens. <br />
<br />
She found In and Id first and asked them where 'Mal'akh Bialyk' was and was directed to <br />
the aforementioned lioness. <br />
<br />
The pride didn't give Martha more than a glance. Some of the Pack did wonder what <br />
Martha's business was, but didn't bother asking the lowly omega. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello...&quot; Her heads said together her most formal introduction, &quot;I am Martha. Prime-<br />
Omega of the Big Bad Wolf Pack. Loyal servant to the Alphas With Every Breath I take. Your <br />
name is Mal'akh Bialyk? 'Joy' told me you wanted to speak with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal'akh Bialyk looked in amazement at the Omega before him... 'She looks like the silver <br />
twins fused together.' &quot;Er, yes... I did... &quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
Being the only 'hunter' who had ... weather she liked it or not, gotten close to the fairies it <br />
fell upon Kathrine to ask. &quot;Are you going to say and watch?&quot; <br />
<br />
The fairy Eve shuddered, &quot;They gave us so much... they helped us so much... we can't really <br />
bare to see them die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... it's your choice that they die... shouldn't you need to watch?&quot; Kathrine asked not <br />
sure of the question herself.<br />
<br />
Titana however said, &quot;We've done our duty... we'll feel their deaths through the magic <br />
weather we are here or not... I remember how wonderful they were as children... I can't <br />
bear to see them die, even if ... even if... good guy Sister Kathrine...&quot;<br />
<br />
The fairies fled Glendale, Rosa, Monica, and  Mal'akh Bialyk seeing them leaving over head <br />
as the fae flew over the town. The fairies never once looked back. <br />
<br />
&quot;We should have made them stay long enough for to cure them and return them to their <br />
real selves.&quot; Linus observed as he saw the fairies leave. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz chose to be silent. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Do you think we can still reach our quota with me taking the time to see the mayor <br />
today?&quot; Madam Serenity called over the phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll just go without sleep tonight.&quot; Father Mike joked (or not). &quot;Please, if it gets <br />
everything set up to kill the curse, then it all the better. See you later today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Depending how long I'm with the mayor. See you.&quot; Madam Serenity hung up on the cell <br />
phone and drove to where Gill/Gillie had to told her to meet her before the two of them <br />
would head for the mayor's office.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity looked around... a good amount of naked giant wolf people... and a <br />
growing and growing number of even MORE giant in size naked lion people. See lion men <br />
naked walking to work holding a brief case with a package between their legs left Madam <br />
Serenity almost disoriented with how -normal- they almost seemed to act but how <br />
abnormal they all looked. 'Of course, it's reality for everyone else.' She thought.  She <br />
wondered how the lionmans dealt with the standardized corporate dress code. <br />
<br />
'I wonder what the ratio of wolf-people, humans, and lion-people, is in town now... '</p>
