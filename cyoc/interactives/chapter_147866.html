<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you calm yourself down, you realize you can’t stay by the entrance. Having played many strategy games before, you come to the conclusion that your best chance for surviving with your mind intact is to outwit your opponent. <br />
<br />
In line with this, the queen would never suspect you to be in the farthest area from the entrance. You realize that you are taking a tremendous risk as you have no idea what’s in the backroom, but you’re willing to bet it all. <br />
<br />
As you begin to sneak your way to the back of the store, you quickly unbuckle your shoes and hide them in nearby clothes. Your shoes are pretty noisy on the tiled floor, which means your best chance of remaining hidden is to walk in your tights. <br />
<br />
As you reach about the halfway point to the back, you suddenly stop and retreat to a hiding point. Ducking down amidst the many costumes, you spy the queen walking down the aisle on the opposite side of the store. She’s sideways to you and appears to be making her own stealth journey to the doors, where you just were. As you notice her head tilt slowly in your direction, you duck down even harder, feeling the platinum waves of your wig tumble upon your head as you try your best to remain hidden. Miraculously, the queen appears to have not noticed and continues on her journey. <br />
<br />
Wasting no time, you quietly pick yourself off the floor and quicken your pace to speedily reach the back desk. As you go around it, you notice that the door to the backroom is slightly ajar. As you slip into the room, you hear from far away in the previous room.<br />
<br />
“Not by the door, eh?! Maybe I’ll find you hiding in the costumes!”<br />
<br />
Scared witless, you hurriedly start looking for a hiding place in the storage room. The room is filled with boxes and stray clothing, but sadly, none of it provides a decent enough cover to hide you. In your panic that you cornered yourself, you spy a smaller door at the back of the room. With no other option, you sprint towards it, silently pull it open, and lock it. Turning around, you feel a stab of terror as you look into the room.<br />
<br />
Staring back at you are a multitude of faces, doll faces to be correct.  All around the room are life-size dolls positioned in various poses and modeling a wide array of clothing. You feel a pang of relief as you realize these dolls are perfect to hide behind. While you feel a bit on edge in the room, as if someone is always watching you, you feel a tiny bit safer here than outside with the queen.<br />
<br />
You find one corner of the room a tiny doll about your size dressed in what appears to be a tiny maid costume. The doll is standing on a tiny pedestal and is turned slightly with its hands placed in front of it, open as if it’s grasping for something. In a box to the side of the doll, you find a matching costume to the one the doll next to you is wearing. As you find a similar pedestal nearby and drag it over next to the maid doll, you quickly formulate a plan that has you stand next to the maid doll in a similar fashion to appear part of a collection. However, your plan falls apart as you realize that although the dolls carry some resemblance to real faces, their heads are larger than yours and their ‘skin’ is a bit pinker than yours. <br />
Feeling panic again, you rummage around in the box with clothes to try and find anything that might help you out. Below all the maid clothing, you find what appears to be a disassembled doll, with a mannequin frame and a doll skin to place over. As you locate a doll head at the bottom, your plan reformulates as you realize that you can take the dolls place.<br />
Your mind quickly tries to estimate how long it would take for the queen to examine all the rows of costumes throughly for you and die to the largeness of the store, you estimate that you have about 15 minutes to become a doll. <br />
<br />
Seeing no other option,  you make room in the box for your old clothes and you begin taking off your clothing for the third time today. You quickly remove your tiara and wig with your gloves and tights soon following. After removing your dress and panties, you empty the box of its previous contents, place your princess costume inside, and place the box where it rested previously. <br />
<br />
You rapidly organize the garments into groups and what you have to work with. You notice that the doll beside seems to be a bit more developed in the feminine areas than you. Among the clothing is what appears to be a pair of flesh colored bike shorts that were oddly padded in some areas. You quickly slip the shorts up your legs and pull them up until they rest comfortably in your crotch area. You notice that your hips seem slightly wider now and that your butt feels a bit bigger as well. Also in the pile is what appears to be a small vest with breast-shaped mounds on the front. You pull the vest on over your chest and are amazed by the appearance of tiny A-sized breasts on your chest. Curious, you give them a quick squeeze before returning to the task at hand. <br />
The next part is pulling the doll skin over your own. You bunch up the legs like you did with the tights earlier and pull up the skin, fascinated by the feeling of each of your toes being encased in cloth. You continue pulling the skin up past your legs, making your crotch area appear smooth and genderless. You take a moment to place your breasts into the pockets of the skin before pulling your arms into the dangling fabric arms. You’re amazed by how smoothly and tightly the doll skin is feeling on your own, as if it was made for you. You feel oddly satisfied as you found its calm, relentless grip comforting. Finishing the job, you pull a hood on and zip the suit up to your head. You take a quick examination of your skin and marvel at how our skins is a perfect match to the milky pink skin of the other doll. <br />
Unsure of how the doll face would work, you decide to put on the clothing, suddenly aware of the time remaining. You swiftly pull black stockings up to past your knees. Your new shoes are a pair of red high heels that your unused to, but you figure you should put them on now and get used to the height Another pair of black panties is soon put in position over your nonexistent private parts and connect a hanging pair of black garters onto the top of the stockings. Next your prepare to put on the dress. <br />
The dress is mostly black with a skirt that stops just above your stocking, showing traces of the garters. The dress also incorporates a corset which you lightly fasten up to make the dress hug your body and tighten the embrace of your doll skin even more. You pull your arms into the sleeves and adjust the white grill on the shoulder to match your counterpart next to you. A white apron is soon fasten around your waist and your tie a bow with the red ribbon on your collar. <br />
<br />
As you finish this, you feel as if the hair on the back of your neck is standing up as see the door handle rattle. Slightly muffled, you hear the queen say, “Funny, I don’t remember locking this door.”<br />
<br />
You begin to go into full panic mode as you realize that you haven’t even put on the doll head in. As you quickly pick it up, you take in the appearance of the doll you will be impersonating for the first time. She has large, sky blue eyes with honey-colored bangs hanging above them. The rest of the wig would hang in loose tresses all the way to your back. On top of the mask was a black with white trim maid’s headdress attached to the hair. The face’s mouth was upturned in a grin that exuded mischievousness and confidence.<br />
‘Well, if this mask can be this confident, then so can I.’ <br />
The door handle begins to rattle again as you realize the queen must’ve found the key. <br />
You open the mask into two halves and feel your breath catch as you notice two things.<br />
One, that the eyes of the mask allowed you to see out of them, meaning that you’d be able to watch the queen.<br />
Two, that there was a long, penis-shaped gag by where the mouth should be. There would be no way for you to put on the mask without putting that wretched thing in your mouth. <br />
With a *click*, you hear the door to your room unlock and so, forced with no other option, you shove the mask on, feeling your tongue trapped as the gag enters your mouth, and snap the mask together.<br />
You hear a small *click* as the mask halves come together, meaning that you’ve just locked yourself into the doll head! Much worse, the zipper to release you from the doll skin was pulled up to the top of your hood, which was now trapped inside the mask as well.<br />
<br />
And so it was that you adopted a similar pose to your twin beside you and prepared to face the queen while locked and silent in your elegant prison.<br />
<br />
As the queen entered the room...</p>
