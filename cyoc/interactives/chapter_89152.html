<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Closing his eyes Andrew muttered &quot;I wish to meet the girl of my dreams.&quot; <br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;He waited a few moments, then looked around the small empty room and let out his breath.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, how stupid can I be, thinking this old thing could grant wishes.&quot; <br />
<br />
He glanced down at the card in his hand, which now read &#39;Wish Granted.&#39; <br />
<br />
Andrew nearly dropped it as he spun to look at the Magician game, then looked back to the card. He turned it over to make sure it wasn&#39;t just double-sided, then walked to the doorway so he could look at it in better light.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Everything alright in there?&quot; a mysterious middle-aged woman asked. She had long brown hair and was wearing an &#39;All Your Base Arcade&#39; polo and a concerned look. Andrew swallowed, his heart pounding, but certainly doubted she was the girl of his dreams.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh, won a &#39;wish&#39; from the Magician game?&quot; Andrew said hesitantly, feeling himself begin to blush.&#8232;&#8232;&quot;<br />
<br />
No kidding! I tried that a couple times when Melody brought it in last week but couldn&#39;t get the hang of it. Hold on, will ya?&quot; <br />
<br />
She touched a bluetooth headset and turned away to speak into it.&#8232;&#8232;  Andrew squinted at the card, trying to see if it was printed with some sort of disappearing ink, but the letters appeared waxy and slightly embossed. He wondered if maybe he&#39;d imagined it said something else because he&#39;d expected it to?  But that didn&#39;t make sense either.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Melody&#39;s on the way, and will take look at that card. Here&#39;s a ticket for a free soda, might not be what you were hoping for, but it&#39;s better than nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
The mysterious woman handed him a coupon and walked away to check on other customers.  &#8232;&#8232;Andrew glanced at the card again and stepped back into the room. He hadn&#39;t specified any time frame, just that he&#39;d meet the girl of his dreams. <br />
<br />
Part of him wanted to have another go at the game so he could win another wish, and maybe word this one better, but he already felt foolish enough believing the first one might come true. He heard the pounding of running footsteps approaching.&#8232;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&quot;Oh my god, is that it?&quot;  &#8232;&#8232;Andrew was startled by the sudden voice, but more so by the feeling of someone pressing himself against his back as he reached around him for the card he was holding. Aside from the light contralto voice and arm he could see, Andrew had no clue if the person behind him was male or female. <br />
<br />
But he felt something squishy, like perhaps a large pair of breasts pressing up against his shoulder blades.&#8232;&#8232;  &quot;Um, you got a name?&quot; Andrew froze, unsure what to do. <br />
<br />
He turned and waited to see a girl, but instead in front of him appeared to be an androgynous young, tall skinny boy, wearing a hat, covered in a sweater and pants.  He had smooth tan skin, and brownish, blonde hair, but presented a decidedly boyish figure.<br />
<br />
The mysterious boy said nervously, “Name’s Mel.  Mel Oliver.”<br />
<br />
Andrew responded earnestly, “Ah.  I guess my luck failed me this time.  But it’s good to meet you, kid.  Do you happen to know Melody?”<br />
<br />
Mel looked at Andrew in disbelief, as his eyes bulged, but he collected himself to do a shrug as he attempted to say coolly, “I do.  She’s not here per se, but I’m her brother.”<br />
<br />
Andrew replied, “Well, it’s nice to meet you, boy.”<br />
<br />
The boy grabbed his hand and hauled it up to where she could read it over his shoulder.  He was several inches taller than Andrew. He tried to pull his hand away, but he was clearly stronger than he was and wasn&#39;t even straining to hold his hand still. Andrew noted in passing that the boy’s short nails were unpainted and had motor grease under them.<br />
<br />
Andrew tried to step away and the boy caught Andrew around the waist with Mel’s other arm and held Andrew in place as Mel turned the card (and his hand) over to view the back. <br />
<br />
Andrew squirmed a bit at the pain from his wrist, then froze again realizing he was basically just grinding himself against his body.&#8232;&#8232; <br />
The boy asked, “Um sir, what are you doing?”<br />
Andrew replied, &quot;Just let me catch my breath, young man.&quot; <br />
<br />
Surprised by the warmth and the feel of Mel’s body, Andrew touched around Mel’s body to cop a feel for his penis.  Mel tried pulling away, but Andrew grabbed Mel’s waist, and felt around, as he didn’t feel anything.<br />
<br />
Andrew eyeballed Mel, as he asked the boy curiously, “Where’s your penis?  I can’t find it!”<br />
<br />
Biting his lip nervously, the boy replied demurely, “Whether if I have a dick is none of your business.  I’d like to think my is quite small, but to answer your question, then yes, I have a tiny dick.  Satisfied?”<br />
<br />
Andrew responded, “Yes.  You’re a really handsome, young man.  But I’d like to feel for myself so that I can prove and verify you to be right.”<br />
<br />
Mel quickly begged, “N-no, you don’t have to do that, really-please don’t-“<br />
<br />
Andrew then quickly shoved his hand down Mel’s pants once more, as the disgusted Mel then slapped his hand away, but it was too late, as Andrew felt the young boy’s… vagina.<br />
<br />
Andrew then reached for the young androgyne’s hat, as long blonde hair fell down the kid’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
The young androgyne quickly stated, “It’s been a while since I’ve had my hair cut.”<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Andrew stopped to think, “Young man…wait, are you…Melody?”<br />
<br />
Melody gasped and started panicking, as ze was unsure what to say. <br />
<br />
Struggling for words, Melody abruptly stated meekly, “That’s my birth name.  But I’m a guy, just born female.  I’d prefer if you’d stick to calling me Mel.”<br />
<br />
Andrew replied, “You&#39;re a guy? I think you have a lot of explaining to do, Mel.”<br />
<br />
Mel replied meekly, “I am a man on the inside…I think.  I go to the men’s bathroom, and everything.  I’m enrolled in my university as a boy.  I was just born with girl parts.  So forgive me if you think I’m a crossdresser, but I’m a boy, that just happens to be transgendered.”<br />
<br />
Perplexed, Andrew responds thoughtfully, &quot;Okay, let me think about that for a sec.  But I swear I felt something squishy, and I&#39;m looking at a smooth chest.  How did you do that, Mel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel then lifted his sweater and T-shirt to show his bound chest to Andrew, as Mel had used an ace bandage to wrap around his breasts. Mel then quickly put his hat back on, and then pulled down his shirt and sweater as he was finished revealing to Andrew his secret.<br />
<br />
Andrew then hugged the boy, telling him, “You’re forgiven.  And yes, I guess you do have a tiny dick, young man.  We can call it as such.  I must say this is interesting, I wished for the girl of my dreams, but instead, I get the transgendered boy of my dreams.  But...I must say I&#39;m okay with that.”<br />
<br />
Mel laughs happily, as he chuckles along with Andrew.<br />
<br />
Confused, Andrew saw what he thought was the prettiest girl on sight, but except the girl kept calling herself a boy.  ‘This is weird.  No way I’m in love with an effeminate transgender boy,’ Andrew thought.  <br />
<br />
More thoughts floated around Andrew&#39;s mind.  &#39;I&#39;m sure he identifies as male, but I bet he must be a genetically buxom blonde if he decides to go back to being a girl.  But I&#39;m sure his breasts also probably give him dysphoria.&#39;<br />
<br />
Mel laid his head on Andrew’s shoulder, leaned his entire weight against him and breathed raggedly against his neck. The sensation of Mel’s breasts pressing rhythmically against him and Mel’s arm around him only added to the intimacy of the moment, and Andrew was dismayed at the suddenness of finding himself becoming quickly aroused.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I ran from the loading bay, I--&quot; <br />
<br />
Mel broke off, as Mel’s arm around Andrew’s waist slipped down to brush against Andrew&#39;s swelling erection. Mel gripped Andrew’s shaft through his pants and gave it a couple squeezes as if to verify it was what he thought it was, before giving in to the urge to kiss him. <br />
<br />
Mel said demurely, &quot;I guess I don&#39;t need to apologize too much after all.  Always wanted to know what it was like to have one of those.&quot;<br />
&#8232;<br />
To Andrew, the kiss wasn’t bad, the young boy, or cross-dressed girl perhaps, was a surprisingly good kisser.  But he felt it was too soon at the moment, so he pulled back.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&quot;What exactly are you doing, Mel?&quot; Andrew asked, then stepped away rubbing his wrist. &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
When he turned to look at Mel his jaw literally dropped open. Mel was clearly related to the woman he&#39;d seen earlier, as Mel had generous hips to balance his magnificently well-hidden bust, long blonde hair, high cheekbones, and wide lips. <br />
<br />
Mel was flushed from running and was wiping off a sheet of sweat with a dirty rag he stuck into his back pocket. He winked at Andrew, then stuck out his tongue.  <br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Andrew blinked then closed his mouth. &#8232;&#8232;&quot;Sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have stared, it&#39;s just, I mean--&quot; He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not used to beautiful androgynous transman wrapping themselves around me and grabbing my junk.&quot; <br />
<br />
He glanced ruefully at his crotch and noted a very clear handprint etched in motor oil on the front of his jeans.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Then what /did/ you wish for?&quot; Mel asked. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get the box with the cards open when I cleaned out the game, so I&#39;ve been waiting for someone to win one. Kinda anti-climatic if the manufacturer just assumed you&#39;d say your wish before playing.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;  <br />
<br />
&quot;They didn&#39;t, I mean, look, don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew glared at him, waiting until the boy responded.  &#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooookay, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mel said, leaning against an old claw machine. &quot;But I reserve the right to change my mind depending on what you&#39;re about to tell me.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, fine, whatever. When I got the card, it said &#39;You Have Been Granted One Wish&#39; so I made a wish, and the next time I looked it said &#39;Wish Granted&#39;.&#8232;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&quot;Yeah, that does sound a bit crazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mel took a step forward then stopped as Andrew reflexively backed up. <br />
<br />
Apologetically, Mel stated, &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry for getting in your personal space and grabbing your pecker--nice package by the way. But I spent hours trying to win that stupid game and finally gave up, so when Mom said some cute boy had won a wish I kinda lost it. Oh, uh, thanks for calling me beautiful? Most guys aren&#39;t into boys who are taller and stronger than they are.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, thanks too?&quot; Andrew glanced at the card again, but nothing had changed. He rubbed at a couple oily fingerprints where Mel had grabbed his wrist.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;d you do it? I tried timing the cams running its mouth, rigging it so the mouth couldn&#39;t close, even feeding a stream of quarters in so maybe one would slip through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot; I just shoved in a quarter and it went right in.&quot; Andrew shrugged.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Mel fished some change out of his pocket and offered it to him. &quot;Let’s see how lucky you can get.&quot;</p>
