<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Heh..&quot; Drew chuckled, not really believing what the paper said. However that first pill he took, it had altered his mind in a way so that he wasn’t totally himself, he became more sexually aggressive, it seemed. ‘But that’s for most drugs.’ he thought. &quot;So... what does this all mean?&quot; He wondered out loud. I shrug, &quot;Dunno,&quot; I look at him and smirk, &quot;Wanna take another one and I'll take two to catch up?&quot; I pat him on the back a bit before just leaving my hand there. Drew grinned, &quot;Nah, you just take one and I'll take one.&quot; he didn’t want us to just shovel pills in our mouths… for health reasons. He was, in some ways, excited to see what the second pill would bring to himself. <br />
<br />
	&quot;Alright then, let's see what happens to you... sir.&quot; I grin and grab a blue pill from a random bag, &quot;It said colors don't matter anyways, so....&quot; He nodded as I stepped forward, taking the pill I had picked up to his lips, and popped it inside. Like before, he just used his saliva to get it down. Not feeling anything strange, he guessed it would probably take a minute or two to take effect, once the protective coating dissolved in his stomach. &quot;Your turn.&quot; I grin, &quot;Pick one for me!&quot; My hand moved down to his waist band, putting my thumb just inside. Drew picked up a dark red pill, not that it mattered, but it looked good enough. Holding the pill in his extended palm, he didn’t expect me to swallow without water, so he wasn’t going to push it in my mouth. I take it anyways and, wanting to copy him, I pop it right into my mouth, eventually swallowing it after a few tries. &quot;See? I can do it, too.&quot; I smirk, turning my attention away from the pills and back to Drew.<br />
<br />
	He grinned, feeling a twinge in the pit of his stomach. He knew something was different as he leaned forward and began to nibble on my lips. He began to feel warm, it was happening a lot sooner than he had thought it would. &quot;You feel anything? Heh, I don't feel any different yet, still in love with you.&quot; I say, not noticing at all that I had said I loved you.<br />
<br />
	Drew pulled away &quot;Nothing really. Did you say you loved me&quot; he smirked. &quot;Huh, what?&quot; I say, wondering why he was looking at me like that. At the moment, I was only thinking about how nice his smile was and how handsome I thought he was. He shrugged, &quot;Alright&quot; Drew leaned forward and began to kiss me slowly, as the warmth spread through his stomach spider-webbing out into his veins.  It was obvious that the mental change had already started to kick in with me, how I spoke my inner feelings and didn't even notice the oddness or suddenness of it all. I didn't know what else might change in my head, but then again, I didn't even know some already had.<br />
<br />
	&quot;So back to earlier... how were you going to get me off without the use of those hands of yours?&quot; He grinned, his heart pounding from the pill beginning to take effect. I wrapped my arms around him, this time grinding into him a bit. &quot;I was gonna fuck that sexy, furry ass of yours, that‘s how.&quot; I say with a grin, again my words coming out of my mouth without any inhibitions. Drew kind of grimaced &quot;Yeah?&quot; but he couldn’t deny that he had a hard on &quot;And how are you going to get me to do it?&quot; &quot;I'mma kiss you until you're so horny, you don't care how you get off!&quot; I say, my smile wide. Then before he could say anything else, I start to make good on my promise and, on my toes, I reach up and plant my lips right on his.<br />
<br />
	Drew held the back of my head and then put his arms around me as his body’s veins began to become more visible than normal as he lifted me with ease and pulled away. I took the hint and wrapped my legs around his waist and held onto Drew’s shoulders &quot;where too?&quot; &quot;I don't care where,&quot; I grin, &quot;Anywhere with you... and besides, you're the one carrying me!&quot; I laughed and continued kissing my furry cop, this time on his cheeks so he could see where we were going and not trip on anything. Drew carried me off to the bedroom, his cock firmly tented, rubbing against my ass as we moved. He laid me down on the bed, but still remained above me as he got on, too. &quot;Yeah? So how you going to flip this situation?&quot; He grinned, his skin tingling with pleasure… and something else.<br />
<br />
	Grinning back, I reached for him and started to tease and tickle his sides. &quot;How's this?&quot; I laugh along with his own chuckling. ‘Man, he’s so ticklish!’ I think with a smirk. Having let his guard down, he was prone to laugh. As he sat up, it was hard not to laugh, but even harder to focus. Soon he rolled to his side and I easily swapped places. Now I was sitting on his stomach &quot;Okay okay! Stop! You won!&quot; He breathed a long drawn out sigh.  Grinning, I kiss his chest. I could feel the hairs beneath my lips. I was turned on even more than before, &quot;And my prize for winning is you?&quot; &quot;Haha, yeah I suppose.&quot; Drew began to feel uncomfortable and was starting to regret taking that pill, but every inch of his skin was telling him that pleasure waited and his cock was showing it. It was enough for him to want to roll over on his stomach and let me go to town on his ass. That way, if something weird happened, I wouldn’t be able to tell. <br />
<br />
	&quot;I love my prize. I wonder what I should do with it... keep my promise, I think...&quot; I smirk, looking up at Drew. &quot;Your promise?&quot; he grunted reaching back and snapping the elastic of my underwear. &quot;Well, my fantasy you asked about.&quot; I kept my smirk, I was enjoying teasing him. Drew grunted again, &quot;So you ARE going to fuck me.&quot; He said, a statement and not a question. He didn’t like the idea, but he said that he would fulfill my sexual desire, and since he was a man of his word...  &quot;Yeah...&quot; I said slowly, savoring the image I had of Drew’s ass, wanting to play with it so badly.</p>
