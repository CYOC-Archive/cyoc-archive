<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank started to do a lap around the pool, but found the heat had really exhausted him. Instead, he swam to <br />
the staircase that led into the pool and laid down on them, relaxing in the cold water with his eyes closed. <br />
He was in such a state of relaxation that he failed to notice the effects of the virus. His body and limbs <br />
were starting to stretch, giving him a few well needed extra inches of height before the main event. He <br />
shifted his weight slightly, trying to get into a more comfortable position. Nobody was going to be home for <br />
at least a few hours and his back yard was well protected, ensuring no glances from would-be nosy neighbours. <br />
The first signs of puberty became noticeable as small hairs started to appear around his groin, his dick <br />
twitching as it began to lengthen. He laid further back in the water with a sigh, which deepened as his adam's <br />
apple jutted out from his throat. He could almost fall asleep right there, he was so relaxed. <br />
<br />
Light hair on his arms and legs were darkening and getting longer. The patch of small hairs around his groin <br />
joined them, slowly spreading outwards and upwards, a thin line of hair growing up towards his belly button. <br />
His dick and balls were still getting bigger, ensuring he'd be well endowed in later life. His facial features <br />
were shifting as his face got thinner and sharper. His jawline strengthened as it started to take on a box-<br />
like shape and thin hairs were poking through the skin around his mouth. By now he had almost grown by half of <br />
his original height, yet his weight had barely increased which gave him a gangly, weedy appearance. However, <br />
that quickly changed as thick muscle started to pack onto his thin frame, beefing up his torso, pumping his <br />
arms and expanding his legs. This was followed by an increase in body hair. It first started in the centre of <br />
his pecs and spread out like wildfire, coating much of his torso with a dense layer of hair. It wrapped around <br />
his body in a wave, some even appearing on his back and ass. His patchy facial hair grew in, stretching across <br />
his cheeks and square jaw with black stubble that hid the skin underneath. The changes started to die down as <br />
puberty left him a fine specimen of a man, but the water was still aging him. <br />
<br />
A few minutes passed and Frank finally decided he should probably get some swimming done. Without opening his <br />
eyes, he dove under the water and swam to the other side of the pool. However, he overestimated the length of <br />
the pool and whacked his head against the side in surprise. He popped above the surface and wiped the water <br />
away from his eyes to see how he made it across so quickly. He let out a shriek in shock, but it sounded more <br />
like a roar, his voice much too deep to even imitate a scream. He couldn't believe his eyes, the weak, tiny <br />
body of a young child he was used to had been replaced with the muscular, hirsute body of a man in his late <br />
twenties. He looked at his huge hands, hair covered the back of them, down to his thick fingers and ran up his <br />
veiny arms in an undisturbed fashion before tapering off around his thick biceps. He felt the meaty muscles <br />
that had rapidly expanded on his torso through the thick coating of hair that covered them. His cock was <br />
floating on the water surface, looking a similar length and width to a banana, accompanied by a pair of balls <br />
that matched its obscene size. <br />
<br />
He had no idea what had happened, but just knew it had something to do with the water. He reached for the side <br />
of the pool and pulled himself out, grabbed a towel to dry himself off and ran into the house to inspect the <br />
damage further. He opened the bathroom door and gasped at his reflection. He had to be at least 20 years older <br />
than before. His face was sharp and square, dense week-old stubble covered his lower face, thick enough to <br />
hide any skin. What he first thought was something stuck to his chin turned out to be white hair, a stark <br />
contrast to the blackness that surrounded it. Frank stared at his reflection for a long time, taking in the <br />
fact he was a man now. How was his family going to recognize him now? His best friend wouldn't even be able to <br />
tell who he was. Then he had an idea. He left the room and bounded downstairs, picking up the telephone left <br />
in the hallway. He scrolled through the contacts until he found the one he wanted. The phone dialed and he <br />
hoped the right person picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; a small voice said into the receiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, is this George?&quot; Frank replied, trying not to freak out over how much deeper his voice was. It certainly <br />
matched his new appearance, so deep and manly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, who's this?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK this is going to sound weird, but it's Frank&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank? Dude, do you have a cold or something? You sound terrible&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm absolutely fine. Listen, I want you to come over to my house. I just discovered something incredible <br />
about my pool. Do our special knock when you get here and I'll answer. It will be me and not someone else. <br />
Just remember that, no matter how, uhm, different I look&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I'll be there in a few minutes. But I can't stay long, my mom's gone to the shops and she should be <br />
back soon&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frank hung up the phone. George only lived a couple of houses down, he should arrive quickly. looking down at <br />
his impressive body, he realised he couldn't answer the door naked, he might scare off his friend and besides, <br />
there were probably laws against that since he was an adult now. He went back upstairs and entered his <br />
parents' bedroom, hoping he wasn't too big for his dad's clothes.</p>
