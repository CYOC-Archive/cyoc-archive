<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A recurring dream especially of late with the discovery of her past returning from its early grave. Selicia watched as a spectator as the memory played itself out again. There standing before her was a cocky young woman who had just begun her apprenticeship. Her raven black hair and steel gray eyes making her stand out to much to hope to blend in. Oh how proud she was so proud of that as well...<br />
<br />
This youthful Selicia was still a fledgling in the art of seduction let alone even those who weren&#39;t gifted to defend against it. As she walked through the forest, she had come to take interest in a local woodsman who frequented a path near her home. Something about his simplicity and muscular frame built by hard-work drew her to him. She often stalked him through the woods, maintaining her distance while moving from tree to tree. If nothing came of it at least she might learn something from the experience, right? This idea however, would come crashing to an end as she followed him out of the woods one day.<br />
<br />
He had spotted her after becoming wary of her presence after so many trips. He&#39;d turned on her with axe in hand startling Selicia by the sudden turn of events. After apologizing and stating that she could be more careful going about the woods alone, he offered to take her home for the evening. Selicia saw this as a perfect opportunity to take advantage of him in the night and prove her skills to her Mistress or at least to herself. When they entered the home, the rugged man cheerfully greeted a modest woman standing over a large pot... His wife...<br />
<br />
The two were quite the contrast, his large frame, dark hair and bright eyes to the wife&#39;s plush frame, blonde hair, and dark colored eyes. They got along swimmingly as the night dragged on, it was quite the happy marriage to be sure. It ate at Selicia all the more as she realized just how much it would take to tear them apart. She&#39;d do it though, if she could... Maybe she&#39;d be ready to move up in skill to take on harder tasks. So it was that she&#39;d made up her mind to slowly take her prize from the unexpected rival.<br />
<br />
Selicia appeared before the woodsman freely after his first invitation accompanying him on his travel to the town and back. She rarely returned to the house as she wanted time with him alone. Not wanting to potentially push him away, she still followed him home a few times a month to keep up appearances. Her conversations with the wife were simple and affable to say the least. That secret distaste for her being held in check at the back of her mind.<br />
<br />
During later trips to the town and back Selicia would make physical advances such as holding hands, touching his arms, and occasionally feigning a trip into his chest. He always seems to laugh it off or not dissuade her leading Selicia to believe that she was winning. She laid on the &quot;charm&quot; more heavily as time stretched on, overdoing expressive bursts of emotion over small cuts, simple jokes, and stories that he might tell. After half a year, Selicia&#39;s impatience caught up with her and she struck with gusto believing she couldn&#39;t fail.<br />
<br />
One late night trip through the woods on their way home, Selicia made as if she&#39;d seen something in the woods and darted into the darkness. The concerned woodsman followed her calling out the false name she&#39;d given him months ago. Once they were a ways off the path, Selicia leapt out of the dark at him, bowling him over by sheer surprise. As he laid on the ground, Selicia sat atop him undoing the strings of her simple dress. His eyes flew wide in shock as he took in just what he was seeing. As she fumbled with the belt at his waist, the woodsmen grabbed her hands. He was certainly unhappy with the sudden attempt at breaking his vow to his wife.<br />
<br />
Lifting Selicia off of him, he wouldn&#39;t look at her and his voice was cold and steady. &quot;I don&#39;t believe we should see each other any longer. I&#39;m flattered but, I have a duty as a husband that I refuse to shirk.&quot; He picked up the lantern that was cast aside and made for the path. Selicia didn&#39;t bother to dress herself before taking those fateful steps toward him. His hand extended behind him, head shaking, and then he left her there in the dark. Her great prize after so much work had only been scorn. That... That would not do...<br />
<br />
Knowing his schedule by heart, Selicia waited until the day he left to town came again. This time she would not follow as she&#39;d been asked, this time her sights were set on the house. Slipping over to the house, cautious at first in case he might&#39;ve forgotten anything, she pushed open the door. The wife was working on repairing some of his torn clothing and saw Selicia enter. She seemed happy to see Selicia, asking how she had been since they last spoke. Despite her failure the woodsman had told her nothing, that must&#39;ve meant that she -had- gotten through to him somewhat at least. If the issue was that he was married to this woman, well... that just meant that she had to go.<br />
<br />
The scene played out just like it had that very day so long ago. Selicia was unpracticed in her delivery of magic at a distance at this point in her life, so she strode up to the woman. Placing a friendly hand on the woman&#39;s shoulder, Selicia&#39;s face twisted into concentration and then a sneer as she stepped back. The woman fell into a panic as her body seemed to melt right out of her clothing. It fell in clumps and ran down onto the floor as she flailed about it horror. She grabbed Selicia&#39;s arms pleading with her to make it stop, her screaming came to a peak as she realized she could no longer grip Selicia. In short order the screaming subsided as her body finally became no more than a flesh colored puddle extending toward Selicia in a slow flow.<br />
<br />
Selicia dropped her dress to the floor stepping into the puddle and sitting in it to expedite the process. The puddle flowed up over and into her body, she moaned softly as she felt the intrusion intimately and then the mind of the wife butt up against hers. It was easy to press it down into the recesses of her body where it would now belong. The oozing form of the once woman started settling in the right areas as Selicia had dictated to the spell. Her body gained some soft curves, her breasts plumped from attracting to exceptional, her ass grew out forming a complimentary curve to the rest of her new frame, and the last piece to finish was the plump vagina lips with a soft, curated blonde bush, the new home of the wife&#39;s consciousness. Selicia stepped over to the water basin nearby and made certain to change her raven hair blonde to match.<br />
<br />
Having successfully removed the obstacle in her way, Selicia decided to reward herself as well as tame the panicked spirit of her new vagina. She sprawling out on the floor, she gently rubbed the puffed lips easing into the pleasure. As she stroked her lower lips, she thought dreamily of a scenario where the woodsman came home to see how much she now looked like his once wife. He&#39;d admit his desire for her and take her right there in the main room. He&#39;d grab her breasts and then he&#39;d gently enter his once wife and deflower Selicia right there. All the while unaware that he was not only fucking her but, the wife as well. She&#39;d feel their consummated love and relinquish her role in his life accepting her new place in the world as Selicia&#39;s vagina. She arced her back as she had subconsciously dug her fingers deeper with the fantasy of the woodsman taking her. She released her fluids on the floor and even found herself amused that it had already begun soaking into the abandoned clothing.<br />
<br />
Hours later, Selicia awoke from where she lay on the floor, the windows dark, and her lips cold and sticky. She sat up apparently having enjoyed herself so much that she drooled in her sleep. She sat up and pat her sticky sex feeling a slight stir from the wife, seems she had succumb much faster than expected. At this rate, she might be nothing more than a vagina before the week was out. Selicia didn&#39;t consider the rest of her body as that woman since she was solidly confined in her place. As she took water from the basin to clean herself, she saw the light of a lantern approaching the house from outside, soon fantasy would be reality~<br />
<br />
The Woodsman entered the home cheerfully calling out for his wife as the door swung open. He froze in the doorway as his eyes fell upon Selicia sitting in a chair facing him with her fingers spreading her already moist vagina wide for his viewing pleasure. Calling out for his wife once more, he rushed past a surprised Selicia as he checked about the house. Just before he made to exit the house again, Selicia grabbed his arm swinging him around to face her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you looking? She&#39;s right here after all, I made it so we can be together and she won&#39;t get in the way~ Even more than that, she&#39;ll be right there to accept your love every night~&quot; Spreading those lips again, fluid dribbled out running running along her perineum and dripping off her anus causing a delighted shiver. As it seemed to dawn on him just what she had meant, her labia quivered sending a spurt of fluid forward to wet her seat.<br />
<br />
The woodsman grabbed Selicia roughly which only seemed to excite her despite the look in his eyes. &quot;You give me my wife back you horrible creature! I never should have gotten involved with you!&quot; His eyes flaring with intent as Selicia realized that once again, she had lost.<br />
<br />
Fury... Scorn... Indignation... Her emotions welled inside her until they could no longer be held in check. She placed her arms on the sides of his neck and stared deeply into his eyes. &quot;I did this for you! For us! Yet... All you can think of is her! Fine! You want her?! Then let me give her to you!&quot; She shot the spell into his body with more power then ever necessary, they fell back onto the floor with his body frozen in position. Another shot of power and his clothing evaporated like mist into the air. She gave him a furious, wild look as she grabbed his dick, it growing rigid immediately with her grasp. With a sharp, painful thrust, she rode the woodsman like a mad woman.<br />
<br />
All the while, the wife howling with pleasure as the rough ride jolting her from her stupor. Without any concern for the woodsman, Selicia rode his dick hard, slapping her lips against his waist driving him as deeply as she could. His eyes only showed fear as his body no longer responded to his commands. The screams of horror in his eyes started as her watched Selicia&#39;s body seem to melt off of her frame. He paid no heed to his own dwindling frame and member while she rode him ever harder. What oozed off of Selicia started to merge with the woodsman&#39;s diminishing form as breasts rose from his chest bobbing from the forceful thrusts. Soon the shaft had pulled from Selicia&#39;s lips forcing her to rub clit against clit as the woodsman became a woman right beneath her. The last thing she felt after the combined orgasm her and the wife had as the transfer completed was satisfaction in getting her way.<br />
<br />
The new woman lay on the floor straddled by Selicia, her body was just a bit larger than Selicia&#39;s and reminiscent of the former wife&#39;s. However the blonde bush stood in stark contrast to her dark locks spread out on the floor. It seemed she had come to orgasm as well courtesy of the wife&#39;s transfer to her as she lay dazed in a pool of their mixed fluids. Standing Selicia observed her handiwork for a moment with a mix of pride, fury, and defeat. She left the house walking back to her Mistress&#39;s home in the nude. She didn&#39;t feel like retrieving her clothing as she reflected on the whole scenario.<br />
<br />
Entering her Mistress&#39;s home, she found that she was waited upon as her Mistress was seated before the doorway. &quot;Selicia, darling... You look like you&#39;ve had a night to remember, why don&#39;t you tell me of it?&quot; She smiled with that same evil sneer Selicia would come to use so often. Her Mistress tossed her long, curling red hair over her shoulder staring jovially with those Emerald eyes as she listened to her tale. She kept her body in peak condition with magic and a bountiful sight to behold for it. Breasts larger than Selicia&#39;s own head and an ass to match that perfect shape. She also kept herself cleanly shaven as Selicia knew from some sessions between them and bathing aside.<br />
<br />
Her mistress nodding sagely with the end of the story and sighed as she stood. &quot;I will have to go deal with them then, they&#39;ll tell more of us and we&#39;ll be hunted as a result. You did well by the sounds of it but, I&#39;ll inspect them to see just how you did personally. You may go to the washroom and bathe while you await my return...&quot; With that she strode at the door which magically barred itself behind her. Selicia made for the washroom in the back as she was ordered to await their return.<br />
<br />
As she washed herself, Selicia peered up at the painting that was prominently displayed for the occupants. A very triumphant young woman a few years older than Selicia sat on a regal chair before a much older beautiful woman who supplicated herself to the younger. The older woman was on all fours shoving an finely crafted oak dildo into herself, her tongue lolled out with eyes rolled up. That had been the fate of her Mistress&#39;s own Mistress and the dildo the Mistress of the former. A little further inspection initially prompted by her Mistress revealed more on the subject. As a final blow, after her Mistress bored of the antics of ownership, she didn&#39;t commission the painting so much as she transformed the now conquered woman into a depiction of the day she fell.<br />
<br />
Her Mistress entered the bath roughly an hour later stripped down for her own bathing. She held something in her hand as she approached Selicia. As Selicia settled into bathing her Mistress, the older woman proffered a stylized cylinder of polished oak to her. Taking the cylinder from her Mistress, she inspected it and recognized the intricate carvings in short order. The woodsman and wife become a single woman had in the same night been reduced to a finely crafted wooden toy for their personal pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;The wife was nearly gone already, impressive. However the man was quite the mess when I arrived. Their minds had still collided causing its own damage and their body was roughly merged. I believe this is a mercy comparably. In either case, a fair show of skill but, one in need of further refinement. We will begin that refinement tomorrow...&quot; With that admission, the dream faded away as the night came to an end.<br />
<br />
Selicia rose from her sleep shaking off the dream of the night before. Lisa was at the door having woken her as she had a guest awaiting her in the lounge. Marina was apparently taking care of the guest so it had to be someone important. Up out of her bed and dressed Selicia descended to the lounge to see to the guest at hand. As she rounded the corner into the lounge Debra was sat on the couch looking rather frazzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s someone powerful making their way her to the town...&quot;</p>
