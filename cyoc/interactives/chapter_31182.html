<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew figured these clothes would be sufficient for now. He had spent over one-hundred Dollars on clothes in the large department store in the mall, and he still had some money left over, just in case he needed some more. He bought three sets of jeans, sizes 35, 36, and 37, hoping that at least two of them would fit, and he could return at least one, maybe two. When he walked up to the cash register, he set all the clothes down, before he pulled out his wallet out of his pocket.<br />
<br />
“That would be one-hundred and forty-four Dollars and thirty cents” the lady behind the county said to him. “You’re lucky, since these jeans were on sale today, and you got ten percent off on them…”<br />
<br />
“If any of them don’t fit me and I need to bring them back, would that be okay?” Andrew asked her, as he handed her eight twenty-Dollar bills. <br />
<br />
“Yes, as long as you have your receipt with you in case you need to return anything…” she explained. “All your clothes must be in acceptable condition, and they cannot be torn or damaged or anything…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I understand…”<br />
<br />
“If there’s anything wrong with them, then we might still take them back, but you won’t get a full refund for them” she explained. “The most you’ll get for it will be about 60 percent of what you paid for it, depending on what you paid for the clothes, and the condition that they’re in.”<br />
<br />
“Alright” Andrew said, as he started to turn around, with the bag of clothes in his hand. “Thanks for clarifying that for me!”<br />
<br />
Andrew wandered around the shopping mall for about ten minutes longer, before he walked out on the parking lot to his car. Then, he got in his car and took the short drive back home. Once he got back inside of his apartment, he took the largest clothes he had purchased, which was the large XXL shirt and the size 37 jeans, and he pulled all the stickers off of them. Then he took the scissors out of his desk drawer and cut the tags off, before he slipped his long legs through the slacks. They just about fit him right. He pulled his belt off his old slacks, and ran it through the straps on his new slacks, finally closing the buckle so that the belt had a nice, tight fit. Lastly, he put on his new sneakers, which fit perfectly on his size 13 feet. He felt great, now that he was decked out in brand new clothes. He was about to go for a walk when his cell phone rang.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” he answered. It was his friend Jake. Jake had asked him if he could come over quickly to his apartment, which was just on the other side of the complex. He was helping a neighbor move in, and they needed another set of hands to help move some furniture. Andrew was a little hesitant at first, since he just put on his brand new clothes. Jake assured him that all they had to move was just a large coffee table and an empty dresser, and it was just too big and too heavy for Jake to move all by himself. His new neighbor was a cute girl, and she was not able to move the furniture all on her own, and he had offered her his assistance. Andrew just sighed and closed by telling Jake that he would be right over.<br />
<br />
Two minutes later, Andrew showed up and knocked on Jake’s door. Jake opened, and introduced him to Shelley, the cute girl next door. The three of them walked over to Shelley’s apartment, where a large truck was parked just out front, which had the coffee table and the dresser on the bed of the truck.<br />
<br />
Jake and Andrew hopped on the back of the truck and lifted the coffee table, which didn’t seem that heavy. Andrew had to use his shoulders and arms to lift it, and he immediately felt his arms grow thicker and his pectorals grow harder and bigger as he lifted the table. Luckily the growth wasn’t that obvious, although he did notice that his new shirt was starting to feel a bit tighter around his torso, and especially around his chest.<br />
<br />
As soon as they got the table off of the back of the truck, they gently carried it through the front door, where Shelly pointed out to them where she wanted them to put it, which was in the middle of the living room floor. As soon as they had set it down, they walked back outside, so they could get the dresser from the back of the truck.<br />
<br />
Moving the dresser off the truck was easy, because they just shoved it until it was resting with the edge nearly hanging over the edge of the tailgate. Then came the hard part, which was: They had to lift the dresser off the bed of the truck, and gently lower it on to the ground. Jake grabbed hold of one end, while Andrew grabbed the other. As soon as they lifted the dresser, Andrew felt the stinging feeling in his legs and in his arms. Luckily, it didn’t last long, for they got the dresser on the ground really quickly.<br />
<br />
“Wow… That’s a heavy little sucker, isn’t she?” Jake said jokingly, while wiping the sweat off his forehead.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Andrew replied. “That’s for sure.” As he looked down, Andrew noticed that his slacks and shirt had started to fit a bit tighter than they were just a few minutes before. Have his muscles gotten bigger, due to all the lifting?<br />
<br />
“Alright, Andy…. Now comes the hard part… Now we have to lift and then carry her into the house and then set her down in the corner in the bedroom… Are you ready?” Jake said, as he bent down using his legs, and carefully grabbed hold of the edges of the dresser with his hands. “Just say when…”<br />
<br />
Andrew bent down using his legs, since he learned never to lift something using his back. That would be a nasty way to injure his back, and he didn’t want to do that. So, he followed Jake’s lead and bent down, carefully placing his hands on the bottom edges of the dresser, and confirming that he had a good grip, before he nodded back at Jake. <br />
<br />
“Let’s do it!”<br />
<br />
Both men slowly lifted the dresser with mighty grunts and groans, as the large, wooden dresser slowly started to rise up off the ground. Then, almost on cue, Jake started walking backwards towards the entrance of the apartment, entering first, while Andrew was walking forwards, and entering last. Andrew felt the strain in his legs, shoulders and arms, as he struggled to keep the big, heavy dresser above the ground. For some reason, however, it was getting easier and easier for him, however, to carry the big dresser. Somehow, it seemed as if he was growing stronger with each passing second! What was going on?<br />
<br />
At the same time, while the two men were carrying the large, bulky dresser through the living room and into the bedroom, another change was happening to Andrew. His muscles were definitely increasing in size, although Andrew was not aware of it. At least, he felt something was happening to him, but he couldn’t see it, because the large dresser was blocking his view. But he certainly felt it! The dresser was getting lighter and lighter. At the same time, his muscles in his arms and legs were growing bigger and bigger, to the point where his new clothes could no longer contain his expanding muscles, which were forced to grow during their hard labor.<br />
<br />
Andrew felt an increasing pain in his legs and in his chest. His pectorals were killing him, not to mention his biceps and his triceps. His sleeves in his shirt were no longer able to contain his growing muscles, and the fabric in his shirt started to tear. The shirt began to rip at the parts where his biceps were, and he also ripped right out of his shoulders. Finally, the buttons on his shirt popped off one by one, starting with the top button and continuing with the ones following the ones beneath in order, due to the expanding pectorals. Andrew was literally bursting out of his button shirt!<br />
<br />
Next, his slacks began to feel much too tight for his legs. His calves had grown so much that they had become large balls of muscle, which were pushing up against every side of fabric, which made up his pant leg. His quads had widened and grown, and now they were pressing against his slacks on the inside, forcing the threads of the slacks to fight just to hold the pieces of fabric together as Andrew was still carrying the dresser to the bedroom. <br />
<br />
When they finally made it into the bedroom and bent down to set the dresser on the floor, Andrew heard a mighty rip! His slacks ripped at the seams, revealing his legs from the ankles to the waist!<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh…. What happened to your clothes?” Shelley asked him, when she saw how Andrew’s shirt and slacks were completely ripped to shreds.<br />
<br />
“I guess I bought clothes that were too small for me… I just bought these when Jake called me to come over here to help you move…” he explained to her, feeling a bit embarrassed. “I guess I need to bring these back, now…”<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, Andrew lived walking distance from her apartment, so he hurried back to his place, hoping that nobody would spot a really muscular guy walking around the apartment complex in torn clothes.<br />
<br />
When he got back to his place, he immediately closed the door and ran into the bedroom, where he threw the ripped clothes off of him and on the bed, so that he could see what had happened to his body. He could only gasp in disbelief, when he saw the radical changes. All the heavy carrying and lifting had caused his muscles to grow dramatically, and he had become absolutely huge!<br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” he said, as he studied his reflection in the mirror. It was unbelievable to him, how massive he had become. He had become freakish, in away. His shoulders were incredibly wide, his arms were enormous, and his pectorals were sticking out by more than a foot! He was truly a hulking giant!<br />
<br />
Once again, he was faced by the same, nagging problem as before: What was he going to wear? He decided he had to wear clothes that could stretch, or he had to get something that was very, very large, for he had no idea how much larger his muscles would grow from this point forward!</p>
