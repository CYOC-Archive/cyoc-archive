<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was exceptionally hot and damp the next morning and the heat made Zossie wake up in a sweat fifteen minutes before her alarm. She drew herself upwards feeling her sweaty shirt peel off the bedsheets in a very satisfying manner. She smacked her dry lips and scratched her head before throwing what little of the blankets was covering her body off and  silently rising to her feet. She stumbled to the bathroom and after peeing in a groggy manner and stripping her sweaty clothes off she stepped into the shower and had the cool water run down her body bringing a smile to her face and energizing her. She woke up in it and began to sing while the water cascaded down her body lining every curve and crevice while running down smoothly.<br />
<br />
After showering Zossie was in a pleasant mood and dressed in her best clothing and did her makeup. Her parents greeted her happily at the breakfast table and the four of them ate quietly before piling into the family car. The beat up vehicle had endured roadtrip after roadtrip taken by the family of eight. Now it was just the four of them and the lack of screaming, arguing, and fighting was still a shock to everyone as they still braced themselves for it. However all that happened was Haley read a book and Zossie sang every song on the radio perfectly for her parents.<br />
<br />
They drove quite a ways to get to the venue. Their only stop was for gas and water. Zossie began to grow excited as they got closer and closer and she used this excitement to mask any nerves running through her mind. They parked the car and Zossie was quickly ushered away from her parents and to the back of the auditorium where a multitude of youth talent sat about with variously sized instruments. It was a disorganized mess and Zossie had no idea where she was supposed to go and what shewas supposed to do until she was next in line while a bunch of string instrumentalists played songs on stage so professionally she felt nervous. Her turn rapidly approached and she began to tap her foot in nervousness and doubted her own abilities. If she couldn’t make it in music she had no idea what she could possibly make it in. That nervousness built until she began to convince herself she would flunk out onstage and never be able to play again thanks to embarrassment but her name was called and She stepped out onto stage breathing heavily. She sat down at a stool with the massively harp in front of her and felt her lip quiver. She felt tiny on that stage and wanted to back away.<br />
<br />
She probably could have screamed and walked off but instead her finger plucked a string and the last of The old Zossie faded with the stage fright. Zossie began to strum the harp perfectly in a lovely tune and her mouth opened allowing an angelic voice to escape it and course over the auditorium. Her voice carried and bounced off all the rafters and back into her ears.<br />
<br />
Zossie felt her body start to change as she played. Suddenly time was moving fast for her and her body expanded. Her B-cups expanded into C-cups while her arms and legs became more toned and her waist caved in perfectly. Her outfit changed along with her hair and makeup as she’s aged to twenty one years old and felt her voice falter. Noise failed to escape it for a few seconds before it resumed but with a different and more complex song. She strumed the harp perfectly in a different tune and the auditorium began to change. The stage lights got More professional and the patrons began to change into finely dressed men and women who weren’t there just because their kid was.<br />
<br />
Silver earrings formed on Zossie’s ears as memories were added to her mind and the new reality sunk in. All the advertisement for the event was about her now and though she’s wasn’t the only part of the original opera she was the star. She had memories of acting on stage as a main player and belting out tones but now she was singing her final piece and the harp solo was quickly ending as orchestra music filled the air and she’s was left singing a high note with closed eyes and holding it while the most beautiful piece of classical music played around her. She added to it with her harp and let her voice falter as she became part of the orchestra playing that beautiful piece. For a mere moment she was the music and the thought caused her heart flutter almost as much as romantic advances from her fiancé Brendan in the audience. He was seated there watching her lovingly beside her family, at least the portion that’s could make it. She was now famous and as the orchestra faded she shut her eyes and became the classical music for a few seconds and she strummed out the final notes on her harp. A beautiful final solo escaped her instrument and got quieter and quieter until finally it ended and for a brief second she opened her eyes and saw a couple seconds of her standing ovation before the curtains shut only allowing the sound to reach her like it had so many times before. Even now it never failed to bring a smile to her face</p>
