<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next four days were an interesting experience for Ethan. Monday he met up with Greg and Haylee, so they could swap back. Greg made sure to thank him for when Ethan and Eric had kept him company on Saturday. Haylee thanked him too, but more for letting her pull her prank on Greg, and how for how much fun having a dick had been. Before she left for class, she winked and patted his shoulder, telling him that when he was &#39;back to full size&#39; he should come find her.<br />
<br />
The reminder of how much less he had was unnecessary, because it was constantly on Ethan&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
During his afternoon practices, Ethan was particularly anxious. He was super careful wearing his speedo, and getting changed, he made use of cubicles as much as possible so he was never in the view of others. It was scary as hell and he was deathly afraid of being caught, but a part of him was enjoying the thrill. He even found he was actually relieved that Eric wanted to keep a larger cock for his school trip. Ethan felt weird that he was stuck with his brother&#39;s equipment for days more, but at the same time, it excited him SO much.<br />
<br />
All through classes, he managed to get his work done and pay attention to his lessons, but his mind wandered in any spare moment. Ethan was split between if he really hated it or liked it, but he found himself daydreaming about it very often. He was a good looking 17 year old and he had a tiny prepubescent penis!<br />
<br />
The knowledge that every single boy around him -- even the most below-average under-endowed in his class -- had a cock that was longer and thicker than his?<br />
<br />
The realisation that he, the star of the swim team and all round nice-guy, had a secret child-size dick, thin and short and hairless, so small that his erections could go unnoticed?<br />
<br />
It made him incredibly horny, and each evening after diligently suffering through his homework, Ethan shut himself in his room and had some alone time. His mind went back and forth between hating the situation and the fact that it disturbed and attracted him, to alternately loving it, his face burning with shame as he played with himself. He would marvel at how super sensitive it was, how soft and smooth his tiny balls were, like he was still a little boy, but how good it felt to be so youthful down there. He didn&#39;t know why, but seeing it between his toned teenaged thighs, fit from all the swimming, heightened the feeling that it somehow belonged on him even though he knew it didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Ethan even had a fantasy where he lost the ring, and Haylee was caressing him, jerking him with one finger, because that&#39;s all she needed to do it, and she gasped and laughed when he came, barely producing more than a couple of drops of cum, knowing that that was all he could ever manage because he was stuck that way.<br />
<br />
It was weird and strange and humiliating, and he knew he should be done with it ... but ... Ethan wasn&#39;t sure why he, for some reason, LOVED it.<br />
<br />
Then Thursday rolled round, and Eric was due back from his school trip. Ethan picked him up and took him home, and all the way, he was enthusing about how much fun he had. All the things their class had got up to, the sights they had seen.<br />
<br />
Last and not least, the most important thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having your dick was amazing! I was careful, just like I promised, but I got so many jealous looks!&quot; Eric beamed. &quot;Even using the bathroom was fun. I had the best time! I shared a room with Josh Henderson, and he kept peeking at me. I wanted to flash him, but I was good.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Ethan, I know I&#39;ve said it a few times now but you&#39;re the coolest ever. I&#39;ve never felt this accepted and respected before. I wish I could keep yours for a while more, but I don&#39;t want to be selfish when you&#39;ve been so awesome already.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a moment of acceptance, Ethan admitted to himself, in his head, an embarrassing truth: &quot;I want to keep his penis for longer. I- ... I want to keep having a little dick! Just for a bit longer -- that&#39;s all! I need to go for it, and take advantage of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since you&#39;ve been so well behaved about it,&quot; Ethan said, keeping his composure and hiding his inner thoughts behind a calm exterior, &quot;I think, um, that you can have a few days more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?!&quot; Eric gasped. &quot;Are you sure? I don&#39;t want to cause any trouble. You don&#39;t HAVE to, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Ethan told him. He smiled weakly as they pulled into home, and he shut off the car engine. &quot;I&#39;m cool like this. You should just enjoy it, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thrilled and surprised, his little brother got out of the car, running off to put his stuff away after the school trip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have to, but I WANT to.&quot; Ethan whispered to himself, and looked down at his crotch. &quot;I like having your dick.&quot; It stiffened in his pants, seeming to respond to his recent decision, and he stroked the fabric gently, heart racing at what he&#39;d chosen. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not turning into some kind of freak ... &quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s excitement was intense. He couldn&#39;t believe Ethan had agreed to extend their swap even further! The school trip had been amazing, but now he had a chance to learn more. Not about anything they had studied during their several days worth of outing, but personally, and intimately. Specifically, Eric mused, he had an opportunity to learn more above having a big dick.<br />
<br />
He took his time packing his stuff away, and made sure to tidy his room, do what little homework was left over after the last few days, and get everything in order. Then he ate dinner with Ethan, his brother cooking for them, as their dad was drinking again, out somewhere else. Together, they cleaned up, and then watched some TV before they each split to their own bedroom.<br />
<br />
Now, it was time to experiment.<br />
<br />
Eric had put a lot of thought into how the experience could be improved. The art of self pleasure was an important one, and though he was young to be learning about it, the gift of a swapped cock had opened his eyes to what was possible.<br />
<br />
First thing was comfort. He gathered up some blankets and made a soft springy section to lie on.<br />
<br />
Perfect!<br />
<br />
Second thing was being as flexible and limber as possible. He didn&#39;t want to strain and hurt himself!<br />
<br />
Eric stretched his arms and legs and back as much as he could, making sure his muscles were loose and easy.<br />
<br />
Third thing was being naked. Clothes were only going to get in the way and make it more difficult to reach.<br />
<br />
In moments, he stripped off, and then locked the door to his room.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the blankets, he stroked his cock, watching it grow into the familiar erection.<br />
<br />
Fourth thing was, of course, practice.<br />
<br />
With his second attempt at self-sucking set in motion, Eric leaned in, curling up tight, and with much more ease, slid his stiff cock into his mouth. Down and down his lips went, and he blushed as he felt himself reach the base. Awesome! Just like it was natural! He was bent over like a pretzel, but Eric was young and supple, and it was no problem to hold the shape. For a minute he just lay there, getting used to the feel of it. His dick was girthy and really long, and it seemed enormous the way it pressed against the soft wet lining of his throat. He concentrated on memorising the shape of it, getting to know the veins and bumps and how snug it felt stuffed in him like this. His balls were touching his nose, and they tickled, causing him to grin around the thick shaft.<br />
<br />
Feeling comfortable as he was, Eric began to suck on it without moving. Even motionless, the sensation was still amazing, and for a while he just sat there, lavishing attention on his swollen penis like it was a lollipop. It would flex in his mouth, giving off little bursts of precum. His eyes were closed, and he just slowly, lazily ... sucked, and sucked ... and sucked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels like it&#39;s even bigger now.&quot; Eric thought to himself, smiling goofily around it. &quot;Like it&#39;s growing because I&#39;m petting it, stroking it.&quot; He slid his tongue along the underside, wiggling it where it was sandwiched between the shaft and his jaw. The dick throbbed in appreciation, causing him to let out a muffled moan. &quot;Maybe I should move a bit, see what that&#39;s like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, he began to piston his hips, and the slick movement of it withdrawing and pushing back in sent tingles up his spine, and little starbursts of joy into his brain. Wow! Wanting more, Eric began to do it quicker, and each sliding thrust was better than the last. In and out it went, his eyes struggling not to roll back after a dozen times. It was hard to hold back anymore, and instinctively, he clamped his lips closer, and the soft slurping of his sucking mouth combined with the fucking of his oversized shaft into a tight wet space, caused an eruption. Groaning and whimpering, he buried it all the way in, keeping it there as pleasure washed over him and his cock shot numerous pulses, his balls quivering in front of his eyes as they emptied themselves down his throat.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, Eric unravelled himself, and sat up. No aches or problems from doing it, and he felt GREAT. Warm, and fuzzy, and on a natural high. He let out a burp, surprising himself, and giggled, staring down at his softening monster cock. &quot;Must have swallowed a lot more than I thought. This thing is the BEST!&quot; He told himself. &quot;Sucking myself is way better than jerking it, and this time was better than the first one. Yeah, I need to practice a LOT more. Just so I know how to keep my cock happy.&quot; He reasoned, making up an excuse to himself. He squeezed it, admiring how it plumped up in response to his hand. &quot;After all, my cock needs a lot of pleasing, so I gotta learn how.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric gave a happy sigh, letting go, and began to get ready for bed, not realising how possessive he was becoming, how attached he had gotten to his big brother&#39;s cock ...</p>
