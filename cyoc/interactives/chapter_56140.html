<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally! Let the party begin! It's a well known fact that the Year 10 boys get a Leaver's Party, for the school to graciously let them go, for the boys to finally end the torment!<br />
There were lights. There was music. But most of all, there were about 100 crazy teenage boys desperate as hell to have the best time they would ever have at St. East's. And what a great time we had! We danced, we sang, we partied into the night. It was nearly midnight before we all made our dazed ways home, the thought that we would have to go back there for one last day to say goodbye wiped from our crazed minds.<br />
We were free!<br />
<br />
I woke up today with a slight headache, but a large milkshake and a bowl of multicoloured cereal flakes soon energized it out of me. I was still excited from the night before, and even more so that we only had one day left.<br />
I arrived on time, as ever, walking into room 4b several minutes before the bell went. I just had to sit through an assembly, receive a certificate and then I'd be out of here!<br />
The bell rang again, signifying the beginning of the Year 10 assembly. Everyone shuffled from the room, reluctant to have move from the chairs. When everyone had taken their place on the hard, red, plastic chairs that were lined up in the hall, a woman in her late forties, Ms. Snitch, the Headmistress, walked to the front of the room and motioned for everyone to settle down.<br />
During her droning speech, I could hardly keep concentrated. A quick look at my watch: 11:40. Still twenty minutes to go...<br />
&quot;And I would like to see the following for a small talk...&quot; She droned. I heard my name amongst the list and groaned silently. What had I done? I'd tried to be good. I mean, it's my grades after all, no matter what school I go to. No one I knew was on that list, but some of the names sounded vaguely familiar.<br />
&quot;And I'd like to thank you all for spending this time for the assembly. I wish you all a successful life.&quot; She finally finished. Everyone raced from the hall as quickly as the caretaker, Mr. Creezle, would allow. Old Creez was a miserable man, strict on the rules, except when he broke them. Everyone knew that he drank a fair bit, and rumours went round that he smoked and even stalked some of the Year sevens, which I had always hoped wasn't true.<br />
<br />
I moved to Ms. Snitch slowly, allowing myself to be pushed around by the rushing crowd. When I did meet her, about thirty other boys were standing silently, diligently, in a circle around her.<br />
&quot;Please follow me, boys. We have some excellent news for you.&quot; She said, before marching off towards the back of the large room, disappearing into a small door at the other end. We followed.<br />
Behind the door it was dark, too dark to see, so a large amount of scrambling and pushing ensued. The light flicked on to reveal a heap of boys piled just inside the door, in front of a spiralling staircase. I gulped. Some of the girls had taunted us about this in Year seven and eight. I still get chills down my spine when I think of it.A voice called from below, echoing in the darkness: &quot;Come down here, children. Hurry along now, but be careful!&quot; I'm not sure how it happened, but I went from near the front, to second in line as we trudged down the stairs, almost reaching darkness before another light flickered on, revealing more steps.<br />
After what seemed like hours, we finally came to a large hall, with a single coffin-like case at the end. We were ordered into single file, like we had when we had come down the stairs, and I was still second.<br />
&quot;Now, Jacob Mortar.&quot; He was first in like, shaking like a leaf. I don't blame him. &quot;Please step forwards and Mr. Creezle will assist you through the door at the end.&quot; Door? That was a coffin, old lady, and no mistake! Jacob wasn't assisted, so much as forced into the 'door', which promptly rattled slightly, followed by a muffled shriek.<br />
Crap.<br />
&quot;Samuel Richards.&quot; I as screwed. So very, very screwed. &quot;Please do the same as Mi- Mr. Mortar.&quot; A slip of the tongue? That was never good...<br />
I stopped resisting as soon as Old Creeze's cold hands grabbed my arm and dragged me into the coffin. The door closed, and the outside world was gone forever. I was stuck in darkness. A rattle and a shake... I was moving backwards, as if on a conveyor belt! I heard the hiss of compressed air and light reappeared as I entered what seemed like a never ending tunnel of machinery. Jacob was nowhere to be seen. I panicked as a large mechanical hand stripped me of my clothes in one swift motion, including my underwear, which, rather embarrassingly, was the red elephant pattern ones that my mother had forced me to wear. I was about to cover my privates when I was dropped backwards onto a cold steel table, metal rings clamping over my wrists and ankles. I suppressed the urge to scream. Whatever the hell this deluded school was doing, I wasn't going to act like a girl. I was going to be the person I should be. Samuel Richards. These thoughts were cut off as two mechanical fiver-fingered hands slipped over my body, tracing an outline first, then applying more and more force until my bones felt as if they would crack. I clenched my teeth as my body was shaped by these terrorizing hands, pushing harder and harder, making me smaller and smaller in... figure? I was physically smaller. The hands had changed my body shape. They continued to work, pushing hard on my waist, stretching my hips and lengthening my legs. My feet were crushed until I lost at least two shoe sizes. My hands were reworked, fingers and nails longer, hands thinner. I had given up trying to resist long ago. I was just trying to live. My face was smothered by two more hands, a lot more delicate than the last pair, much like my new ones. They pulled and twisted my face, but I couldn't see what they were doing. I glimpsed a smaller nose and longer eyelashes before my eyes themselves were attacked, causing me to let out a small shout. My vision was blurry for a few seconds, but I could see again soon.<br />
Above, I felt the hands grab my short hair, pulling and pulling, as if trying to make me bald, but instead, when the pain stopped, I saw a strand of golden blonde hair fall in front of my eye, quickly swept away by more hands. I was more than scared now. I was petrified. I wouldn't have been able to move even if I wasn't strapped down.<br />
I looked to my chest as round, short fingered hands began to caress my nipples, causing them to become erect. At this point, the delicate hands reappeared for a second to pull the nipples and work them around, increasing the areola size and the nipple length. At this stage, I must have looked pretty strange to anyone around. The delicate hands were replaced by the round hands again, which sprinkled a light pink powder over my chest, which seemed to melt slightly on contact except for the nipples, which had calmed from their erected state. The large hands spread across my now wobbly chest and fondled them. I could only stare as the hands slowly moved further and further away from my body, mounds of flesh rising underneath like foreign mountains of jelly. After several minutes of this, it stopped, leaving me unable to be sure whether I was terrified or extremely happy. Part of me longed for the motion to continue, the other screamed for sanity, which was nowhere to be found.<br />
My conflicted mind was frozen as, yet again; the delicate hands appeared, this time lower down. I merely accepted this. I was a lost cause, long since gone. I peered over my new weights to see my genitals being cupped, sending strange pleasure signals to my brain. My member quickly stood up, facing the ceiling, as it had done several times before with a couple of my female classmates, much to my embarrassment. But I didn't feel embarrassed now, only delighted to be normal as more pink powder dissolved onto my genitals, causing a more noticeable effect than on my chest. My soldier immediately wobbled and caved in on itself, encouraged by the hands, which worked my privates until nothing remained. A small pause, and the hands grabbed the area where my crotch used to be and gently eased into my body, a small moan of pleasure escaping my lips. It fingered around, moving left and right, gracefully flicking fingers around my insides. Slowly, it emerged, much to my disappointment, giving a last gentle slice, leaving only a small, feminine slit, a gateway to the pleasure I had experienced only a few seconds before. I looked up again, pleased with myself for being brave, and, in the end enjoying it.<br />
The table turned to a thirty five degree angle in front of a mirror, giving me a full view of my new self, from golden blonde hair and stunning green eyes, to seemingly large, wobbly chest, to flat stomach, to small blonde fuzz, covering my new genitalia, to long, sexy legs.<br />
After not nearly enough time, the mirror was taken away and I was released from the table onto a corridor. A small, green exit sign shone at the top, and without hesitation, I walked off down it, satisfied as my hips swayed, my chest bounced and my hair flowed. I loved the feeling of the air moving around my form. So much so, that I was slightly disappointed to reach the door at the end. I opened it and walked through.<br />
Inside the door was a small, blank-white room, with a single table and chair in the middle, the same colour as the rest of the room. On the wall there was a full length mirror, and I couldn't resist the urge to take a look.<br />
I was beautiful. I mean drop dead gorgeous. My hair reached the middle of my back, my chest was pleasantly sized, not outrageous, my legs seemed to go on forever. A flicker on the mirror knocked my thoughts. An image of myself... My old self... Of me appeared on the mirror, merging into my current reflection, screaming soundlessly. Something in the back of my mind awoke. This was wrong. So very wrong! I wasn't a girl! I was S... Sa-... To my horror, I couldn't remember my name. The whole reflection cut out, the two images of myself merging, one screaming, the other confused. A black screen appeared, with a single green, flashing line on it, like on old computers. It began to type.<br />
&quot;Congratulations, Samantha Richards. Welcome to your eleventh year at St. East's School For Developing Young Minds! We chose for you to stay because of your excellent grades and contribution to the school. Thank you for helping!&quot; This was followed by a colon and a bracket, creating a reassuring smiley face. Samantha Richards... The text moved up off screen as more appeared beneath.<br />
&quot;Please watch this video closely. Don't worry, no tests will be made. This is purely beneficial to you.&quot; The text disappeared, replaced by a dark blue screen and lots of flashing words and letters, moving so fast I couldn't read them. But they helped. I felt strangely reassured and my whole body felt natural again. I remembered my life and how great things had been recently... I was going to do my GCSEs this year, but I had worked hard at St. East's and I was prepared...<br />
The video suddenly stopped, leaving two large, green words on the screen: Good Luck!<br />
I turned as two hands dropped from the ceiling, laying out clothes on the table. When they had gone, I reached for the white C-cup bra, which I put on with expertise. I had done this all my life, after all. Next, I slipped the silk panties over my crotch, followed by the tights, knee-length skirt, and the white blouse. I pulled a school jumper over my head and pushed my bra up slightly, checking my appearance in the mirror before exiting the room as directed by the mirror-screen.<br />
<br />
I was ready.</p>
