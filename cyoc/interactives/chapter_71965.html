<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angus rejoined Patrick and Marcus in the tattoo parlour. When Dan entered the room he looked at Patrick and <br />
Marcus fighting for a place in the skinny mirror, their massive cocks bouncing about as they nudged each other <br />
for a glimpse of their Master’s mark.  They were both completely transfixed on the new permanent fixtures <br />
situated on their rumps, it was obvious that they were quite transfixed. Never before had they felt so <br />
completely fulfilled with themselves, so completely loved. Their new symbols on their back a symbol of them <br />
finding their purpose and their duty in life, nothing could take this away from them.<br />
<br />
They were so transfixed on their rumps, occasionally rubbing them, that they didn’t notice Dan enter the room.  <br />
The pain of the tattoos were only starting to catch up to them. It wasn’t a<br />
stinging pain, it reminded them of when their Master marked their necks.<br />
<br />
Dan stood behind his two bulls in the mirror, clearing his throat to make his presence known. The two turned <br />
around hastily, immediately falling to their knees upon the return of their Master. He had only been away for <br />
a matter of minutes attending to Angus but just looking upon the sheer beauty of their Master was enough to <br />
overcome them.<br />
<br />
They started to tear up again--first Patrick, then Marcus--the once proud and strong campus alphas completely <br />
ruled over by their supreme dedication and loyalty to their Master. They found themselves helpless to their <br />
feelings, their former inhibitions crumbled. All there was in this world now was their Master. They didn’t <br />
care how they appeared to other people. They now existed in<br />
a bubble in which their service to their Master was the only thing of  value. His praise and satisfaction in <br />
their service sustained them, validated their existence. Without it, they would surely be undone.<br />
<br />
Instinctively, Patrick and Marcus commenced kissing their Master’s feet and legs, relishing the small amount <br />
of physical contact this allowed them, every kiss their Master allowed being a gesture their love, their <br />
devotion and their servitude before their Master. Dan was very proud of his work, not only were his pups <br />
needing his attention with a ferocious hunger, something that he would surely leveredge for his own advantage <br />
and personal satisfaction later, but to get down low enough Patrick and Marcus had to bend down very low, <br />
their brands reading “Property of Master Dan” looking back at him as they kowtowed.<br />
<br />
Dan heard a heavy whimpering behind him where Angus was standing. He was standing at attention near the <br />
doorway, his balls weighted down and churning visibly, inching larger as they filled up. The whimpering grew <br />
louder, much more urgent. He needed to be with his brothers, on<br />
his knees serving his Master, but until he was given expressed permission he would wait dutifully. Beads of <br />
sweat were starting to drip from his pores, his eyes big and helpless, his breathing becoming deeper and <br />
staggered.<br />
<br />
“Angus, come here and join your brothers”. Commanded Dan, finally relenting to Angus’ whimpering. With that <br />
Angus’s face lit up and he lumbered over to join his bull brothers as quickly as his pendulous balls would <br />
allow. As he took his position, his ball stretcher came down on the tile floor with a metallic ringing <br />
*kurchunk* as it rested behind Angus by several feet, visible past sticking out under his rump. Unused to his <br />
new nipple rings, Angus rings sounded colliding with the floor pushed out by his massive pectorals. He <br />
commenced his tribute to his Master with an even greater intensity than his other brothers. They were all <br />
completely and hopelessly lost in their own worship of the one they so heavily craved and needed with every <br />
inch of their being. Tears poured down their faces, getting caught in their beards.<br />
<br />
They loved their Master so much, they were so incredibly thankful for the gift they were given. No words could <br />
adequately articulate  their feelings, the best they could do was express their<br />
feelings through their duty and eternal loyalty - the only things they had, the only things they could give, <br />
the only thing their Master wanted.<br />
<br />
Dan was surprised that there was enough of him to go around, amazingly enough there was. There wasn’t a clock <br />
in the tattoo parlour but it felt that they kept on going at it for what seemed at least twenty minutes.<br />
<br />
Barry the tattoo artist cleaned himself off and tidied up his studio around them. Cheekily he muttered to Dan <br />
“If only had a dollar for every time I saw this happen in my office, I wouldn’t have to ink anyone ever <br />
again.” He muttered.<br />
<br />
The comment shot Dan out of his own heady Dom-space, but his pup’s were completely undeterred and <br />
undistracted. “What’s that?” Dan replied.<br />
<br />
“We get gingers in here with their new Master’s all the time. There’s not going back now, ever.  Something <br />
happens within the chemistry of their brains, it gets rewired.” Barry paused, eyeing the grunting, whimpering <br />
trio of hulking redheads at Dan’s feet...he adjusted himself, clearly enjoying the sight.  “Ahem...I mean from <br />
puberty gingers seek out a Master, but when they find one it does something to their brain, it rewires it from <br />
the inside out. Being branded is the most important day in a ginger’s life. They are chemically bonded to you <br />
for life. You think they are loyal now, give it some time then you’ll understand. I mean having the honour of <br />
being the Master of one ginger is an honour, but having these three particular gingers beg to call you their <br />
Master, well you must be something special.” Barry chuckled as he continued to clean the semen out of this <br />
studio.<br />
<br />
Dan left the moment sit with him for a moment. His precious pups would be even more loyal than they are now <br />
and growing more dependent on him every day?  The thought was almost too<br />
much for Dan to take. Dan sighed, not wanting to interrupt his pups when they seemed to content with <br />
themselves in that they are doing.<br />
<br />
“Sit up” Dan commanded. They complied immediately, at attention with their hands behind their backs.<br />
<br />
“Your Master is very proud of all of you. You have made a lot of important steps important steps in fulfilling <br />
your service to me, but I want to make myself completely clear that these are only the first few of many. I <br />
have chosen all three of you because I believe in your potentials to serve me. First of all I would like to <br />
state some things that I hope I’ll never need to repeat.”<br />
<br />
Angus, Patrick, and Marcus looked up to their Master, wide eyed and hanging off his every word. Barry’s <br />
sentiment made more sense now...Dan saw three massive redheads, each one fidgeting with eagerness to please <br />
him.  He could re-program his pups however he wanted, and they would love wherever Dan took them. “Yes, <br />
Master?” they barked back, Patrick whimpered, in pain from his growing, overpowering need to serve.<br />
<br />
“I am your only Master. I am the one you serve. You are my property and I own you for the duration of your <br />
lives. You will only refer to me as Master and by no other name. Your service to me is your number one <br />
priority, you will choose your service to me above all other activities. You don’t have lives outside of your <br />
service to me, thinking about a life without serving me will cause you supreme pain and guilt.<br />
<br />
“Secondly, as your Master I demand your complete honesty. Your minds belong to me. If I ask you a question you <br />
will answer as fully and as truthfully as you can. If you ever disobey an order you are to present yourself to <br />
your Master immediately and confess your disobedience. Your Master’s word is law. I am always correct and you <br />
are to never question me. If I ever tell you something that contradicts, you are to accept the latter <br />
statement to be the truth. You are to support your Master entirely in all choices that he makes.<br />
<br />
“Next, you are to always let your Master know how you feel about him. You will profess your emotions and <br />
gratitude towards your Master through your words and your actions. You will always let your Master know how <br />
important he is to you. As you sink deeper and your words will fail you, never let this discourage you.”<br />
<br />
Dan watched his commands hit Patrick, Marcus, and Angus word-by-word.  His pups took in what he said, smiles <br />
on their faces, beaming with pleasure. Patrick and Marcus’s cocks started to inflate behind them unwittingly, <br />
moved merely by the direct attention they were receiving from their beloved Master. They blushed, drinking in <br />
every order. They craved the structure their Master provided them, they needed to be ruled over by their own <br />
personal king. As the synapses rewired in their minds, this need would become deeper and more intense. Their <br />
dedication and drive superseding all other needs, including self preservation.<br />
                                                    	<br />
“As my property,” Dan continued, “You are to take care of yourself as you would any other of my possessions. <br />
You will present yourself with pride. Being my pups, you are to keep your beards neat and your hair cut in the <br />
styles I prescribe to you. Your clothes will be pressed and clean. As my property you have no right to <br />
concealment. While at home your uniform will be either a clean jockstrap or nothing, depending on my mood. <br />
While you are out of the house you will wear a short kilt that goes halfway down your thigh and a pair of <br />
boots.”  Marcus eyed Patrick’s kilt, his beard, his boots and suddenly felt completely naked and extremely <br />
anxious.  Every moment he was out of uniform was time spent disappointing his Master!<br />
<br />
Dan turned to Angus.  Even on his knees, Angus was just above eye-level with Dan.  His handsome face wet with <br />
tears of gratitude and joy from being in Dan’s presence.  “Angus, your uniform is a bit different.  Besides <br />
your chastity device and some thick boots, you are to remain naked at all times, inside or outside the house. <br />
If you feel cold you may requisition your Master for more clothes, you are warned that this is a privilege <br />
awarded to you by your Master, not a right.”  Angus nodded, unable to find words to thank his Master, and just <br />
whimpered before kissing Dan’s feet in understanding.<br />
<br />
“In social situations you will not speak until spoken to to, you will not recognise people until I have given <br />
you expressed permission from me. All you see is myself and that which can assist you in your goals to serve <br />
me, everything else is invisible to you, existing on another plane of reality to you.”<br />
<br />
“As my submissives you are to always push yourself to grow larger. When you look into the mirror I want you to <br />
not see the progress you’ve made, I want you to see the untapped potential which dwells inside each of you. <br />
This will push you to strive even harder; it would make your Master very happy. If your size remains stable <br />
for too long you will attract the disappointment of your Master. You will eat only that which makes you <br />
larger, you will always be full, I want your muscles to constantly be sore from all the intense workouts <br />
you’ll be doing. Patrick?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master” Patrick replied.<br />
<br />
“As the ex-president of the powerlifting club and Angus’ alpha, you are entrusted with the responsibility of <br />
guiding him from the bodybuilder physique he presently has and making him larger, stronger, beefier. Angus, <br />
you need it, it would make your Master very happy. Patrick, you are to assist him in proper form, he will grow <br />
to be equally strong as you and have an equally large belly. He is your protege.” <br />
<br />
Dan paused to make sure that he was clear. He looked down as his pups giddy with all the new commands and lost <br />
in their lustful desire to submit.<br />
<br />
“Do you understand?” Asked Dan.<br />
“Yes, Master!” Replied his three pups in unison.<br />
<br />
“Do you understand?” Dan asked again, even louder.<br />
<br />
“YES MASTER!” Angus, Dan and Marcus replied, worked up by their Masters orders. This was their life now. If <br />
Dan didn’t believe that he had their wills completely in the palm of his hand, he would have almost found the <br />
intensity of their tone scary. <br />
<br />
“Angus, Marcus, Dan. Your old lives are for all intents and purposes gone, they ceased to be when you took my <br />
collars. Your lives became my property when you took my brand. You will not be returning home for your <br />
possessions. You have none.  You will not say goodbye to your friends, nor your family. Your brothers and I <br />
are your family and your friends. Everything that happened before you took you took your collar belongs to <br />
another person, you are reborn in my service.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Master!” <br />
<br />
“Dan, Marcus. You are to leave your old clothes here. They aren’t yours, you should know better than to take <br />
things that don’t belong to you.” Dan fished through Marcus’ singlet and Angus’ pants on the floor for <br />
anything left behind. “Money, identity cards... Both of these belong to me, you will have no need for them. <br />
You will assist your brother Angus to return to our new apartment, bearing your brand for the whole world to <br />
see. Now rise to your feet. show your gratitude to Barry for his masterful artwork and let’s go.”</p>
