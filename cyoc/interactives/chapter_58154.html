<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rain spotted Serena and called to her. Serena saw he and imediatly ran up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So finally awake are you? quick back in your room, we need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serena and Rain entered the room, and immediately Rain Went on thanking her for changing her, until Serena Cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean we need to talk.&quot; Rain stopped dead, how did Serena know about Sean, Rain tried to ask but was cut off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't remember me, I made sure of it. But you had a friend names Kyle, keyword 'had.' you see I took a quick look threw your purse, and found the Cronivac, A later model than the one I had. I used to be kyle, before I became this. I still remembered my old life, and therefore remembered you, but forced everyone to forget me. Go ahead ask your questions now.<br />
<br />
Rain had so many questions to ask, but didn't know which one to ask first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, Why did you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Serena laughed. &quot;Well same reason you did, just a little experiment that got out of hand. I became a girl, your girlfriend in fact. then became a goth, then a vampire-imitator. then using the cronivac I had added more and more features to myself until I became an actual vampire. and before I knew it I didn't want to change back. Now, here I am. I maybe a 300 year old vampire now, but that wasn't the case 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the others?&quot; Rain asked.<br />
<br />
Serena Continued &quot;Others who sought the night and wanted refuge from the soul crushing devastation of Normality, People who wanted more, so I gave it to them, and now I have this little family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what to say, I feel like I've been caught with my pants down.&quot; Rain said. Feeling embarrassed that someone was able to recognize her.<br />
<br />
Serena laughed again, &quot;Don't worry about it, but now you have three choices to make, between Rain and Sean, Just who do you want to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain was confused. &quot;Three? That sounds like one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Serena smiled slightly, as she lit a cigarette. &quot;Well, from what I can tell there are 3 differences between Sean and Rain. and you have to pick just who to be, first. Man or woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain wasn't surprised at how quickly she answered, but the nature of who she felt she truly was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be a Man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serena nodded. &quot;as I thought,&quot; She said, before taking another puff.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, I Think you might change your mind, but for now choice 2. Sean is a Normal, While as Rain is Goth, Which do you pick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain found this a hard choice. As a goth she felt like she was dead on the inside, like she had no soul. But there was a certain release to it. It was somehow liberating. Both held their Benefits, but ultimately the goth won out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, said Serena, now the big one. Human or vampire?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain thought she already made her choice, but then realized. The cronivac! It could, theoretically change her back If she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Serena remained silent for a moment before she said. &quot;I know you don't remember me, but please allow me to show you what you would leave behind if you changed back. I simply want you to make an informed decision.<br />
<br />
Rain thought for a moment, That seemed wise didn't it? This is the opportunity of a lifetime, why not see just what it had to offer before closing that door forever. So she agreed.<br />
<br />
First, Rain, I'm going to show you what being a woman is all about.<br />
<br />
Serena brought her to the bed and started stripping her off. Rain knew what was coming, and went with it. She felt the power coming from Serena, and knew that she was in control. Rain felt this was right however, and soon lay on her back.<br />
<br />
Serena dived between Rains legs and began to lick the outside of her sensitive Areas. Rain felt a euphoria overtake her as a feeling inside her began to build. soon, a tongue entered her nether regions, and rain began to moan uncontrollably The pleasure built in increasing waves of ecstasy, and  exploded within her into her first female orgasm. Soon another began to build and rain could feel her inner man, Sean disappear. Sometime after her fourth or fifth orgasm she was no longer a man in a woman's body.<br />
<br />
She was well and truly a woman, regardless of whoever she was before. Serena came up to her face and kissed her passionately, Rain could taste her own Juices from Serena. Serena broke the embrace and told rain there was one more thing to do. Serena left, and soon came back with a plastic bag, filled with a red liquid. Rain soon realized it was blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;We only take from the willing, and never enough to harm them. We have people who offer it to us in exchange for various things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kinds of things?&quot; rain asked as Serena poured two glasses for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of us are movie stars, Hiring actual vampires can save a lot of money on Special effects. especially if your only paying them some blood. Others Simply pay for it, with money acquired from at home jobs. And the desperate sell their bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain took the glass of blood offered her and looked at it. Inside her mind she felt the human parts revulsion at the liquid, and her new vampiric mind's revulsion, she took the plunge though and took a sip, only to find herself draining the glass.<br />
<br />
It didn't taste like blood at all, to her new vampiric senses it was the sweetest wine, the most luscious fruit, everything she ever wanted to taste in one. and she felt the new power she had rising, fueled by the lifeblood she consumed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Rain, since you have tasted the pleases this life offers you, you have all you need to make an informed decision. Man or woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain wasted no time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woman&quot;<br />
<br />
Serena smiled, as she caressed one of Rains nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human or vampire?&quot; Serena asked, knowingly pouring two more glasses of blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so it was Rain would spend the rest of her days a female Goth vampire, But here adventures were only beginning.</p>
