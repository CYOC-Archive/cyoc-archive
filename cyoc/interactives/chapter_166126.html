<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at the gym, he couldn’t help looking around to identify more potential targets. He already had a good idea of who he wanted to mess with first – the mental swap he performed with Tim yesterday gave him knowledge of some of the regular patrons and there were a few in particular he thought would be good candidates.<br />
<br />
Dan spotted one of them the minute he got into the changing room, a personal trainer who was just stripping off his outdoor clothes to put on his work kit, a vest to show off his yummy arms and short nylon shorts to showcase not just his taut thighs but his generously proportioned package.<br />
<br />
Dan had seen him around town before his switch with Tim and followed him on social media. He’d always admired the way he filled his clothes. The dude – Adam – was older around 30 but with a youthful face, tall, broad shouldered and well built. More stacked than Phil, who had a more lithe athletic body. He had sparkling blue eyes, nicely coiffed blond hair with a short neatly trimmed beard lending his youthful pretty features enough of a masculine quality to complement his manly muscled form.<br />
<br />
Dan particularly enjoyed Adams instagram videos of his morning living room yoga. He always wore just a t-shirt and a pair of briefs, which boasted a juicy looking bulge that looked like it was about to burst through the cotton. Watching the package bounce with each new pose was mesmerising.<br />
<br />
It was clear from the videos that Adam was cocky. He knew he was pretty and he made no attempt at modesty. He also seemed to have a new girlfriend joining him on his videos every month or so. He was a womaniser and he didn’t care who he hurt.<br />
<br />
Dan thought he was ideal for his next prank. He got changed as quickly as he could so he could catch up with Adam and follow him out of the changing room. He was worried he’d lost him at first, but when he opened the door to the gym he spotted Adam flirting with one of the female gym staff, a few years older than Dan. He was resting his arm against the wall, almost trapping her with his body. She didn’t seem to mind but to Dan it looked uncomfortable. Fortunately he had an idea about how to deal with Adams outrageous behaviour, but he needed a donor, and not one Adam would be likely to get intimate with.<br />
<br />
Dan found what he was looking for. Allie an 18 year old girl living in the same building as Dan but a few floors down what was working away on a treadmill. She was friends with his mate Sara so he was reasonably well acquainted with her. She was plain and mousy and shy – the opposite of the girls Adam liked to show off on Instagram. Perfect.<br />
<br />
Dan shifted position so he could get a good look at Adams delicious looking package in profile which seemed to be plumping into a semi as he talked with his colleague. Made sure he had Allie in sight then made his swap.<br />
<br />
Adams shorts deflated in front, his bulge flattening into loose folds of excess fabric. He didn’t seem to notice though nor did it break his stride flirting with his colleague. In fact, biting his lip lustfully he went straight from saying “if we were alone right now, I’d love to feel your soft hands slide into my pants, stroke my shaft.” To “slip your lip s between my legs and eat out my pussy.”<br />
<br />
Allies pants were packed, a long tubular bulge snaking down her right thigh. Her stride was different to accommodate her third leg. She looked a bit pissed off, kept adjusting her member like it was causing her bother, but seemed to be working harder at her workout.<br />
<br />
Cockless Adam did not seem to have any trouble getting the girls number. She had handed him her mobile and was putting her number into his contacts. Clearly, having no cock was no issue for a man as suave and confident as Adam.  <br />
<br />
Presumably even in this reality, Adam got plenty of action. Perhaps girls truly were more fluid than guys. Disappointed that his trick didn’t seem to have had the effect on Adams ego he had hoped, Dan needed to think of a new way to mess with Adam. He thought he had the ideal plan, but first he needed Adams old cock, but he couldn’t just yet as Allie had disappeared.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Dan decided to get on with his work out while waiting for Allie to reappear. It gave him a good chance to watch Adam and see how being a dickless wonder had changed his behaviour.<br />
<br />
He was surprised – in many ways, Adam was as cocky as he was before. He was a handsome man with an achingly beautiful body. Clearly there were women happy to experiment with a pussy to have a chance to spend the night in those muscular arms. Dan was grateful for his decision to steal Tim&#39;s exercise regime in this moment, it gave him the chance to admire Adam up close. He was particularly turned on by the dudes loose empty crotch, the way the folds of fabric hinted at his emasculation every time he walked. Dan struggled to control his – formerly Tim’s – hypersensitive cock while he was exercising.<br />
<br />
Finally, Allie returned to the room. Dan smirked as he observed the obscene bulge in her tight exercise clothes. You could practically make out the shape of her new cock head.<br />
<br />
Intrigued by how she had changed, and keen not to lose track of such a delicious looking cock, Dan went over to Allie to say hi.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, you’re Sara’s mate, aren’tyou?” Allie said as Dan greeted her.<br />
<br />
“yeah, not spoken to you for ages. In fact, Sara and I are heading to the movies tomorrow if you want to join us? Not sure what we’re going to see yet. We normally decide at the ticket booth.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah sounds great. Do you want to text me what time and where?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Dan dictated his mobile number and Allie texted him hers.<br />
<br />
Great, he now had a way to keep in touch with his new dick-wielding gal pal, so he no longer had to worry about losing any parts he might want to use again.<br />
<br />
That sorted, he concentrated on her new member, watched it shrink considerably, but not entirely – a small tent remained in her leggings. He felt his own crotch swell, become painfully constricted in his too small shorts. He turned away from Allie as his new cock grew in, felt it slip out the bottom of his pants. He goggled with amazement as a purple, circumcised cock head peeped almost shyly from the bottom of his shorts. Turned on by the sight, he watched as it began the harden, lifting the hem of his shorts. He needed somewhere private now – looking around to make sure no one was watching, he headed to the toilets.</p>
