<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a small smirk, she pointed at somewhere Rick wasn&#39;t expecting at all. Something that brought back his unease nearly in full force. It was a maternity store. A place that was almost certainly going to lead to a pregnancy - a far cry from the previous changes. &quot;There!? Why there of all places!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, aren&#39;t you the least bit interested what&#39;ll happen if we &#39;blend in&#39; there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I mean kind of, but...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then you can see my point!&quot; Before Rick could continue, Emily began dragging him over to it with a big grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait...what if we can&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just talked about this - we can just change back at home if anything goes wrong!&quot; Emily retorted with conviction. <br />
<br />
Rick wondered if there was more to her decision than simple interest. Why would she be so adamant about going to a specific place in that scenario. Then he realized a distinct possibility: could it be she was looking to see what it would be like if she was pregnant? If she was a mother? The thought flustered him, as if this was a prelude to the two of them possibly having a child. Perhaps it was her way of seeing if she would enjoy being pregnant or not. The difference in this case is the camera could reverse things in the blink of an eye - no need for permanence quite yet. Still, that meant he would become a fetus for a time! Did he want to experience that, even for someone he loved? He glanced back at his girlfriend, still dragging him along - a few feet away from the store. She had such fire in her eyes...such determination to see this done. He let out a sigh as he resigned himself to his temporary fate. Well, so he hoped at least.<br />
<br />
The two finally reached the shop, where Emily soon went on to double check the settings were in order and both would still be aware. She was determined, but that didn&#39;t mean her judgement was completely clouded. Once she was sure everything was in order, she pulled Rick close, looking up at him. Now seeing each other&#39;s eyes, both could tell what the other was thinking. Rick knew he was right in his judgment. &quot;You ready?&quot; Emily asked to absolutely confirm that her boyfriend was okay with this. Rick gave a small nod. Thus, Emily moved the camera in front of them for a selfie. <br />
<br />
At the last second though, Rick thought of something. How their perceived roles wouldn&#39;t be a guarantee. How in his haste of understanding why Emily chose this place, both of them seemed to neglect the alternatives. How he...and she...could...<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; He shouted, right as the camera went:<br />
<br />
*FLASH*<br />
<br />
Rick held his eyes closed, briefly wondering what he had turned into. He felt himself still standing. He felt heavy weights on his chest and belly. He felt an emptiness where his dick used to be. He took a deep breath before opening his eyes. Just as he had feared at that last moment, he was now a pregnant mother. A third trimester one to boot.<br />
<br />
Though he was thankful it wasn&#39;t totally alien given he transformed into a woman earlier, the sensations were still incredibly intense. His tits were absolutely massive thanks to the pregnancy - easily E-cups if not bigger. A small squeeze indicated they were filled to the brim with milk, a little bit even shooting out of him. A moan escaped before he realized how inappropriate this would look to the outside observer. He looked around, hoping no one had noticed. It seemed that no one had. He let out a sigh of relief as he noticed his big black blouse and lacy red bra helped conceal the leaking milk. <br />
<br />
This led him down further, where even the top couldn&#39;t completely cover up his belly. He placed his hand on it, giving it a small rub. He suddenly let out a feminine gasp as he felt a force from the inside. It was a kick! &quot;E-Emily?&quot; He whispered, still loud enough for Emily to hear through her new protective home. Rick received another kick in response. There was a loud grunt as Rick felt incredibly vulnerable in such a position. Both the kicks and weight of Emily were far too much for him to handle. Before anything else, he needed to rest. <br />
<br />
He attempted to move away from the maternity store to somewhere even slightly more private, only taking but one step before stopping for breath. He continued to pant, as he spoke to Emily again: &quot;I-I understand you&#39;re frustrated, but...p-please give me a minute...I...want to sit somewhere.&quot; A few deep breaths without another large kick indicated she obliged for the moment. She was still very much active, turning as much as she could with her weakened muscles and occasionally stretching her arms and legs for a more comfortable position, but it was low energy enough for Rick to relax a bit. Well, as much as he could, given the circumstances.<br />
<br />
He began to waddle to a bench - what was only feet away now feeling like miles, and requiring short breaks to continue. He looked over himself more in the meantime, going below his belly...below Emily. As much as he tried to avoid it, the baby bump was far too large for him to entirely ignore. He&#39;d have to make do with looking at it alongside his breasts if he wanted to see his lower half. Thus he did, feeling his breasts bounce as he checked his new form out. There were yoga pants which matched his blouse in color. However, they were much tighter than the top even given their comparable size. His bubble butt, childbearing hips, and thick thighs were just that big now! Giving the former a small smack, he let out a moan as it began jiggling. The tightness down there only intensified with his panties, which he ever so briefly pulled his pants from the side to see. Red and lacy, matching the bra. With the additional notes of him having red flats and long red hair, it seemed this new form really preferred that color.<br />
<br />
At last the man turned mother reached the bench, letting out a loud huff as he sat down. This seemed to jostle Emily again, and allowed her to recognize what was going on. She acknowledged this with a slightly harder kick like before. Rick grumbled, already starting to feel sick of those kicks - worse in that he knew right now that was her only method of communication. He lightly rubbed his belly, partially hoping it would somehow comfort Emily like it would normal fetuses. &quot;Shh...yeah I know...don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll change us back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uttering those words is when he realized...he didn&#39;t know where the camera was! In his haste to relax even slightly in his new form, he forgot about the location of it! He began frantically looking around, hoping it hadn&#39;t gone too far. What was he thinking, he only walked a few feet! It couldn&#39;t have...unless...did Emily holding the camera when they transformed lead to its own complications? What would happen when the camera&#39;s user suddenly became a &#39;package&#39; of another person?</p>
