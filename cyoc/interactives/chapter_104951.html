<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the possession of the ring, she thought that she could head on home and show it to her mother.  Kellie, her 43-year-old mother, always took good care of her ever since she was born.  Ever since her father passed away during Kellie’s pregnancy, her mom had been supporting Katie for seven full years.  Which is why Kellie has taken a full time job as an attorney, to help provide money for Katie’s college when she grows older.  Katie was happy that her mother takes care of her and was very happy about it.  However, she’s always worried about her as well.  All that work Kellie has done has taken serious toll on her body as the overworked hours have aged her poorly.  Because of that, she is always tired and never has the time to spend with her daughter.  Katie sighed to herself and knew that her mother would be spending time with her after all of her hard work.  She wished she could give her mother a simpler, much more easier time.  Meaning that she would give her and much happier life.<br />
<br />
Looking to the ring she recently possessed, maybe she could help with that.  When she turned the bully into a little kid, and herself a year older, maybe she can do something with her mother.  With her knowledge improving to a full year, she slowly started to understand what’s with the ring.  From what she can put together in her head, this ring could not only physically regress or progress herself or those around her, but also gives her the option of mentally changing anyone as well.  There is even the possibility of altering reality if she wanted to.  So that means whatever she picks will turn anyone into whatever age she wants, that will include her own mother.  Katie could imagine all the possibilities she can do with her mom.  She could regress her to when she was seven so they can both play, or return her to her mid twenties, when she was at her prime, or even age herself so they can be twin adults.  The possibilities are endless.<br />
<br />
Still, there’s the one concern that Katie wondered about.  What about her mother?  What would she feel about it?  In her mind, she could make sure that she wasn’t fully aware of the changes, one of the perks of the Age Ring.  But her heart tells her that it’s wrong.  She’s fully trustful and truthful with her mother.  She would never do that to her.  She’s the most honest person she looked up to.  So, giving the situation, she decided to suck it up and tell her mother about the ring.  It’s the best of options.  After all, she will never keep a secret from her mother.<br />
<br />
Approaching her home, she took a deep breath and took her key out from under the welcome mat. Slowly opening the door, she entered the house and said, “Mom, I’m home!”  Heading to the kitchen, she could see her mom cooking up some dinner.  Turning to her, she smiled and said, “Welcome home sweetie.  I hope your hungry, because dinner’s almost ready.”<br />
<br />
When she turned to see her, she noticed something completely off about her.  Kellie doesn’t know it, but it looks like that her daughter’s clothes looked shorter then usual.  She almost looked a little tall as well, like a few inches to be more precise.  It confused her and she saw her with her clothes as comfortable from this morning.  So out of curiosity, she asked her daughter, “Katie…?  Why are you clothes smaller then normal.  I could’ve worn they would be a good fit for you this morning.  Were they in the wash for too long or something?  What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Katie looked to her mother and knew that she’s expecting answers.  The part of her wants to alter her mind, but she believes it’s wise to let her in on the secret.  Giving out a sigh, she decided to let it out and said, “Mom?  Can you sit down for a second?  I want to speak to you of something.”<br />
<br />
The mother looked on in surprise, as she didn’t expect her daughter getting a little mature then usual.  “Okay…” she said as she took a seat and listened in to what she was going to say.<br />
<br />
With Kellie sitting, Katie decided to show her by asking a question.  “Tell me mom, have you ever missed being young again?  Where you don’t have to worry about your job or wanted to spend more time with me?”  Kellie heard that question and answered nicely.  “Well…  Yeah…  I guess…  I know I support you with my job and all, but I do miss those times when I’m young and carefree.  Why do you ask that question?”<br />
<br />
That’s when Katie showed her the ring on her finger and explained it.  “Well, I found this on the sidewalk on the way home.  Now it looks like an ordinary ring, but it’s something special about it.  What it does and change a person’s age, whether it be you, me, or someone else.  This can also alter anyone’s mind or reality and can make the person aware of the changes or not.  This ring can make anyone’s life better, including you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie listened to her daughter and was a little quiet over this.  She was quite surprised that she has the know how in explaining some things.  This even includes words Katie will never say before.  She was still silent about the whole thing until she started to snicker a little bit before she broke off in laughter.  “That’s funny, Katie!” she exclaimed still laughing, “That’s very hilarious!  A ring that can change a person’s age including mine.  That’s rich!  I take it you read too many fairy tales, have ya?”<br />
<br />
Katie could tell that she didn’t believe her, as she knew it was about to happen.  “But it’s true!” she continued, “And it worked!  I turned a bully into a little kid and made myself a year older.  That’s why my clothes looked a little tight.”  Kellie still didn’t believe her as she said out loud, “Yeah right!  And I have two heads on me.  You really are a laugh riot!  You know that?”  She continued to laugh and thought that it was really funny.  Katie sighed to herself and decided to take some stricter actions.  “Alright…” she said to her mother, “If you don’t believe me, then I’ll show you.”<br />
<br />
She soon closed her eyes and muttered under her own breath, “I wish I was a year older.”<br />
<br />
Kellie heard her say something and asked, “Did you say something, Katie?  I thought I heard you say that you wish to be a year…”<br />
<br />
She soon stopped what she was saying and saw something she couldn’t believe.  She saw Katie looked a little taller as she shot up a few more inches.  Her clothes started to get a little tighter as the bottom hem of the shirt rose up and exposed her stomach.  Her hair started to grow longer and was brushing her shoulders.  And her face started to loose some baby fat as it looked a little mature.  Looking on, she could see her daughter looking a little older, 9-years-old to be exact, and was close to reaching double digits.  Katie looked to her mother with a serious look and said in a tone with a little lower sound in her voice, “Do you believe me now…?”<br />
<br />
Kellie looked on in shocked as she started to process what has happened.  “Oh…  I see…” was all she could say.  Kellie kept on processing this as she wondered about it all.  “So this ring…” she started to ask, “It can actually change me?”  Katie nodded and explained about it.  “Absolutely.  This ring changed my life as I used it on the bully and myself.  It can do the same to you.  Think about it.  You can be whatever you want to be.  You can be in young and beautiful, a kid full of energy, anything you want.  All you need to do is make a wish, and it will give you what you want.”<br />
<br />
Kellie listened in and this time, she understood what really matters.  After seeing her age a full year, she now has a chance for a better life.  Maybe even better.  Thinking of this, maybe Katie’s new ring could actually make her life an improvement.  Looking to Katie, she asked for a favor.  “Hey Katie…”</p>
