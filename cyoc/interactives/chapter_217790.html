<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This might be my favourite chapter I’ve ever written.<br/>
<br/>
This chapter takes place on Day 1 of Yummies’ new global product, just before the effects of it are felt around the world.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the far-off town of Barleyford was the Barleyford School for Boys. An lifeless old building that consisted of narrow corridors, rusted staircases, and splintered bookshelves. Its gymnasium, however, looked brand new. A huge court with floors shiny from fresh wax, and state-of-the-art equipment for all sports locked neatly away in a spacious storage closet by the entrance. In one of its corners was a small labyrinth of a passageway leading to the boys locker room. Even though there was no door, the smell of teenage musk that had seeped into its walls acted enough of a barrier for most from entering.<br />
<br />
It was the evening. Only one light in the gym was on, which acted like a spotlight in the very centre. Finn had just emerged from the locker room, and was standing awkwardly in the corner, in the darkness. His black hair looked like a shadow. His pale, scrawny figure shivered in a loose navy blue wrestling singlet. The straps dug into his bony shoulders, and he recoiled at the feeling of spandex rubbing against his skin. He had his barely-used sports bag over his shoulder. He stood there, waiting.<br />
<br />
Then, the doors to the storage closet opened, and a tall, muscular teen walked out carrying a wrestling mat. His name was Seamus. Like Finn, he too was wearing a singlet, but his body suited it much better. It was a mixture of white and red with blue stripes, with the school logo pressed between his pecs. It looked a few sizes too small, and it could barely wrap around Seamus’s upper thighs. His strong arms were on display, flexing as he lifted the mat up with ease. His curly mess of ginger hair hung on  either side of his face, which had small and striking eyes that glowed green like emeralds. Finn quietly admired Seamus’s form, especially noting the teen’s bulge, which was thick enough to visibly bounce as he walked. He had an ass too; Finn wished his was as big. Everything, from the shivering cold to the disgusting spandex, was worth it to have a private session with Seamus Claverty of the Barleyford Wrestling Squad.<br />
<br />
Seamus walked to the centre of the gym and dumped the mat under the light. His bag was already there, mostly open and its contents spilled out.<br />
<br />
Finn approached Seamus who, upon turning to face him, jumped.<br />
<br />
“Bloody hell. You scared me,” said Seamus with a laugh, “I didn’t see you in the darkness.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to,” said Finn.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright. Okay then, you ready?”<br />
<br />
Seamus clapped his hands tigger her and crawled onto the mat sitting on it with his legs crossed. Finn watched and waited until he was done before he responded.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, thanks for doing this,” he said shyly.<br />
<br />
“It’s no problem. Could always do with more lads on the team, and you gotta start somewhere right,” said Seamus, smiling lifting his arms and shoulders as a friendly shrug.<br />
<br />
Finn smiled back and he put his bag next to Seamus’s. His stomach rumbled loudly. So loudly it echoed slightly in the giant space. Finn looked down, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Blimey, you sound hungry,” said Seamus.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I haven’t eaten today, so—“<br />
“You haven’t eaten?!” <br />
<br />
Seamus’s appalled tone in his voice startled Finn, who looked up to see the muscular teen genuinely surprised.<br />
<br />
“It’s almost 8! I eat at least five times a day just to maintain muscle mass. This takes work,” said Seamus as he flexed his biceps. Finn was practically hypnotised until he stopped.<br />
<br />
“When you messaged me you said you wanted to be a wrestler like me, right? Well, you gotta eat plenty. Check my bag, there’s probably some leftovers or a snack  in there you can have.”<br />
<br />
Finn nodded silently as he knelt down by Seamus’s bag. He could smell the sweaty gym clothes that had fallen out of it. When the scent reached his nose he couldn’t help but take a deep breath in. It smelled good. He reached his hand in the bag and rummaged. He found no leftovers, but his fingers came into contact with something small and crinkly. He pulled it out before realising what it was; a condom. Seamus saw it too and quickly grew embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry, that’s for my uh…I’m meeting up with my girlfriend after this and…uh yeah, just put it back,” Seamus said, his pale skin turning red.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Finn said, throwing the condom back in the bag and he continued rummaging. He felt something larger; a packet of something. He pulled it out to see ‘Yummies’ NEW Perfectionery! Eat Happiness!’ written on it in all kinds of colours. Seamus saw the packet.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, some big guys at a booth gave them to me for free, said they ‘liked my look or something. Apparently they’re new; came out today. Have ‘em,” he said.<br />
<br />
Finn struggled to open the packet but when he did the powerful smell of artificial apples wafted in his face. He looked inside it to see small balls of glowing purple and orange in a swirl pattern. He picked a few up and ate them. The texture was like a marshmallow, and tasted amazing.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” said Finn with a slight smile.<br />
<br />
Seamus smiled back. <br />
<br />
“Right, I think we’re ready to start.”<br />
<br />
Seamus got to his knees as Finn put the packet down. Before he did, he quickly swiped another two candies from the packet and ate it. He knelt in front of Seamus. Up close he could see the the veins in the boy’s arms, and Adam’s apple that moved as he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Okay it’s your first session, so we’re just gonna go over some basics, okay? If you do any of these in a round you’re bound to win. We can do proper wrestling next time.”<br />
<br />
Seamus then taught Finn how to wrestle. Initially it was a lot of talking, but they soon moved onto demonstrations. Finn felt like he was lighter than air as Seamus moved him around into position. The first demonstration had Finn lying on the ground with Seamus pressing his whole body into him. <br />
<br />
“I tend to nickname the moves to help me remember them. I call this one the Meatpress.”<br />
<br />
His bulge was pushing firmly into Finn’s stomach. Their faces were just inches away, their mouths closer than ever. Finn pretended he was listening and nodded along, but was entranced by the teen’s green eyes. Seamus had a cocky grin on his face, flexing his shoulders to show off. He was certainly enjoying himself, but not as much as Finn.<br />
<br />
“Feel that?” asked Seamus.<br />
<br />
He was talking about his bodyweight. Finn felt completely immobile under it.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” said Finn, trying to hide his enjoyment.<br />
<br />
“See? I told you, it takes work,” said Seamus as he flexed his biceps again for a brief moment. Finn wanted to reach out and touch them but refrained. Most people would find these demonstrations humiliating, but Finn was enjoying every single second of it. He was trying his hardest not to get a boner the entire time, but when Seamus moved him for the second demonstration he could feel something stir in his crotch. <br />
<br />
He then felt a tingling sensation in his chest. It was soft, like a tickle. Finn assumed it was adrenaline. <br />
He was too busy enjoying the demonstrations he didn’t realise his crotch had grown slightly, and the singlet had become more fitting. He was no longer cold.<br />
<br />
Seamus spun Finn around and pressed the boy’s head between his meaty things. They dwarfed Finn’s tiny skull. Finn felt Seamus’ bulge rub against the back of his head. He saw Seamus nonchalantly flexing his biceps to himself, admiring the strength of his own arms, before returning to the demonstration.<br />
<br />
“This is the Chokehold. Grab my legs, it’ll help you keep balance.”<br />
<br />
Finn obeyed immediately. His hands could barely wrap all the way around them. They flexed under his palms, and he resisted every urge to squeeze them. The body heat between Seamus’s thighs was overwhelming. His muscular legs was shiny with sweat, which rubbed off on Finn’s cheeks. His nose welcomed the teen’s intense musk, which was all he could smell. Finn saw he was getting a hardon, but was too lost in lust to care. Part of him wanted Seamus to know. Seamus let go.<br />
<br />
“Time for the Finisher.”<br />
<br />
Finn was suddenly lifted off the ground. Seamus had picked him up with his strong arms and lay on his back, holding the boy on top of him. He spread Finn’s arms and legs apart with his hands and feet and thrusted with his hips, bending Finn’s spine. Finn didn’t even process the pain of it, instead letting out a soft moan when the Seamus pushed his bulge into the boy’s lower back. Finn could feel the teen’s hot breath by his ear. His cock was fully hard now, tenting his singlet as it stuck up in the air. <br />
<br />
“How does that feel?” asked Seamus.<br />
“Great. It feels great.”<br />
“Great? It’s supposed to feel uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
Finn felt disappointed when Seamus let go and crawled towards his bag, reaching for a water bottle.<br />
<br />
“Five minute break. You alright?” he asked casually.<br />
<br />
Finn turned his back to Seamus, quickly hiding his boner from him and giving a thumbs up in response. Seamus scanned Finn. The boy looked slightly different, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on what exactly. Older maybe? The boy’s black hair has lightened, and he looked more toned, with his singlet riding an inch or two higher up his legs. Was he taller? He also had the beginnings of a bubble butt, which Seamus found himself looking at a few moments more than he needed to.<br />
<br />
Finn was able to will his erect cock down mostly, and turned back to face Seamus with an eager smile. His boyish face looked more mature with subtly defined cheekbones and a thicker neck which stood on wider shoulders.<br />
<br />
“I wanna keep going,” he said, louder than his usual introverted tone.<br />
<br />
“Okay then, let’s go,” said Seamus, smiling at Finn’s enthusiasm, “This time, we’re gonna switch places so you’re gonna do to me what I just did to you, okay?”<br />
<br />
Jackpot. Finn took no time in assuming the first position. He practically leapt onto Seamus, pinning him down. Seamus grunted in surprise when his head hit the mat, and looked up to see Finn’s face merely inches from him. He glanced up and noticed the boy’s arms were looking slightly thicker with muscle. This time, it was Finn’s crotch pushing against his stomach, but Seamus squirmed when he felt Finn’s bulge move. It slid a few inches further up his abs, as if it was growing, unbeknownst to either of them.<br />
<br />
“How’s this? The Meatpress, right?” asked Finn with a smile. <br />
<br />
Seamus could see a more prominent jawline on the boy, and his once blue eyes were starting to look more grey. The boy’s hair was gaining some colour. There were so many details to look at Seamus didn’t realise Finn’s voice had dropped slightly in pitch.<br />
<br />
“Uhh good yeah…have you always had a—“<br />
<br />
Seamus cut himself off when he felt his body quickly spin around. The next thing he knew was his head was jammed between Finn’s thighs, which looked less bony than before. Finn looked down with a smile.<br />
<br />
“And this? The Chokehold?”<br />
<br />
Seamus grabbed onto Finn’s legs for support. Without thinking, he squeezed them, feeling slabs of muscle he was sure wasn’t there before. The boy’s chest also looked thicker, and his jawline only grew more pronounced.<br />
<br />
“Were you always this, umm—“<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Seamus felt the boy’s bulge against the back of his head. It definitely felt bigger.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” said Seamus.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Time for the Finisher.”<br />
<br />
And with one swift motion Finn swung Seamus on top of him, spreading his limbs apart and thrusting. Seamus’s ears were filled with Finn’s grunts, which sounded lower and more masculine. He felt a small jolt of excitement when he felt Finn’s crotch ding into his ass.<br />
<br />
“How’s that?” Finn whispered.<br />
“Good,” Seamus replied, unnerved but turned on, “really good. You sure you haven’t done this before?”<br />
<br />
Finn let go, and went to his bag for a bottle of water. Seamus watched him and almost couldn’t believe his eyes; he looked like a jock! The singlet now looked a bit too tight on Finn, with a toned but thick body of muscles tucked in the spandex. Seamus’s eyes wandered over to the boy’s ass, which was more pronounced and bounced slightly when he jumped on the spot. Finn looked different, better, sexier. <br />
<br />
“Yo, something about you is different,” said Seamus with a worried look, “you okay? ‘Cuz if not we can do this another—“<br />
“I feel great. I feel fucking amazing!”<br />
<br />
Finn let out a deep laugh as he turned to face Seamus. His hair had become less straight, and was more brown in colour. His eyes had shifted to a cyan colour and Seamus saw an Adam’s apple like out. The boy looked like he’d been wrestling for a while. Seamus was drawn to his handsome face which smiled and winked at him. Seamus wasn’t gay, or at least he thought he wasn’t. He saw the boy’s bulge and his eyes widened at its new size.<br />
<br />
“Let’s wrestle, for real,” said Finn, throwing his bottle to the ground and walking onto the mat, squatting. The spandex of his singlet stretched. <br />
<br />
Seamus laughed. He was never one to turn down a challenge, especially not someone who was now somehow his size.<br />
<br />
“You’ll lose mate, but alright, if you really want to—WOAH!”<br />
<br />
Finn lunged at him, rugby tackling him to the floor. They violently tumbled across the mat, each trying to throw the other one on his back. Their hands moved as fast as bullets, grabbing whatever body part they could to push each other over. Seamus was taken aback at how strong Finn had suddenly become.<br />
<br />
Seamus tried to grab Finn and throw him into a Meatpress, but was almost shocked when his hands grabbed hard muscle instead of what was once nothing but bone. The muscles seemed to expand in his grip. He let out a yelp when Finn grabbed his ass effortlessly threw him to the ground, pushing him deep into the mat.<br />
<br />
“MEATPRESS.”<br />
<br />
Finn’s voice sounded really deep now. He looked to be taller than the teen too, as if he had just grown a few inches. All Seamus could see were two wide pecs, and deeply defined abs push through the navy blue singlet. He felt completely helpless, and his cock twitched when he realised Finn was grinding his semi hard bulge against it. Finn’s cock was hardening too, but felt much bigger, and thicker, like a python. Seamus pushed Finn’s arm off-balance and they continued their scuffle. <br />
<br />
Their bodies fell on each other, and Seamus almost pushed Finn’s head down into a Chokehold when he felt something grab his dick. He looked down to see a massive hand covered in veins with sharp fingers cup it. The sudden feeling sent a jolt of pleasure along Seamus’s spine, and within those seconds it grew fully hard. He tried to push the hand away but soon felt two huge chunks of meat crush his head. These legs were thicker than his waist, and the singlet that once encased them easily was tearing slightly at the seams. <br />
<br />
“CHOKEHOLD.”<br />
<br />
The voice sounded familiar, but Seamus had no time to contemplate it when he saw two hands slide down his muscular chest, making their way to his erect cock. Finn’s hardon was pushing against Seamus’s head, who was in shock of the size of it. In desperation, Seamus broke free from the Chokehold and went to grab Finn’s shoulder. Only, when his hand met it, he suddenly realised how wide and thick with muscle they had become. The straps to the singlet were barely holding on. Before he could turn to face Finn, he felt his body lift high into the air, landing on the massive boy.<br />
<br />
“AND FINALLY…”<br />
<br />
Seamus tried to squirm his way free, but the body he was laying on was bigger than him, and stronger. His legs were spread wide apart, and his arms were raised above his head. His cock throbbed with anticipation, and was leaking precum. He knew what was coming. His ass clenched, bracing. This was it.<br />
<br />
“Please, no—“<br />
“THE FINISHER!!”<br />
<br />
Seamus was almost deafened by Finn’s new voice as he felt a throbbing monster of a cock jam perfectly between his cheeks with one powerful thrust. The sensation, the sheer power that had pressed into his ass, was almost too much for Seamus. He let out a huge moan as he came in his singlet, lost in the Earth-shattering orgasm. They stayed in that position for a few moments until eventually Finn tossed Seamus to the side and got up. Seamus was on his hands and knees, panting. His face was red and sweat poured from his forehead. He looked down at the patch of cum in his singlet, feeling it trickle down his thigh.<br />
<br />
“Dude, that was…holy shit, what the fuck was that?!”<br />
<br />
He turned to face Finn.<br />
<br />
“HOLY FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Finn, the short, quiet kid with black hair and a measly physique, was gone. Seamus was in disbelief; staring back at him was a mountain of a man, with pale skin, and a face that could turn even the most alpha of straight guys into submissive cumwhores. Staring back at him was a 7ft tall wall of muscle. His singlet was torn in along part of his chest, and his pecs spilled out of it. His tight waist bloomed into incredibly thick thighs. Staring back at him was a foot-long cock that was begging to get out of the tight spandex prison as it leaked precum at an obscene rate. Staring back at him was a stubble-ridden jaw, and bright green eyes, underneath a head of curled ginger hair.<br />
<br />
Staring back at him, was him.<br />
<br />
“Come here.”<br />
<br />
Seamus recognised that voice now. It was his voice, only manlier, and resembling a lion’s growl. He obeyed Finn without question, until he was standing just inches from him.<br />
<br />
“You’re…you’re me? But how?! And what—“<br />
<br />
Hundreds of small, wavy lines in the air exploded from Finn. Seamus didn’t notice them, but breathed them in and as he did, his demeanour changed from that of fear to desire.<br />
<br />
“Woah…that’s intense.”<br />
“Take it off.”<br />
<br />
Seamus obeyed without hesitation, taking his singlet off in such a hurry he tore it. He stood completely naked with a rock-hard cock covered in his load. He didn’t care though, instead taking another step closer and placing a hand on Finn’s pec.<br />
<br />
“You look like me, but…”<br />
<br />
His hand wandered down, keenly massaging the hulking teen’s abs.<br />
<br />
“You look so much better than me. I want you, I want me.”<br />
“What about your girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
Seamus hesitated for a second at Finn’s question, but dismissed it.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want her, I want you. I need you.”<br />
<br />
His hand reached the tip of Finn’s cock. He was practically drooling. His foot knocked the half-eaten bag of candy. He needed that monster cock inside him. Nothing else mattered.<br />
<br />
“Good,” said Finn with a cocky smile,<br />
<br />
 “suck it.”</p>
