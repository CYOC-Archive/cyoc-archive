<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After much thinking, Gloria came up with a decision and decided to go to the Gender Wing.  Sure the animal might be a fun experience, but it would be uncomfortable walking around in four legs.  And the Age Wing can make you younger and older, but there wasn’t much fun in reliving your childhood.  So she thought the Gender Wing would be a much better option.  So she waited for the tram to the Gender Wing and entered it once it got there.  The ride took five to ten minutes upon getting there and it was much soothing for the moment.  Once the tram stopped, Gloria ext the cars and enter the main lobby of the Gender Wing.  When she did that, she was completely surprised at what she saw.<br />
<br />
The lobby of the Gender Wing was truly amazing.  The lobby had a triangular shape to it and there were two colors that were split in two.  On the left, the color of the walls were blue with pillars of naked men, on the right the color was pink with pillars of naked women.  In the middle of the lobby a fountain with two statues of on male and one female with their backs against each other on their respective sides bending down on one knee and holding the symbols of their sex over their heads.  She looked around the crowd and saw the number of people wondering around the place.  Some of them all seem normal at first, but there were others that were completely different.  For instance, there were a few males that have boobs, the women had huge breasts but also small lumps on their pants and skirts, and a few females had incredibly muscular builds.  Another thing that caught her attention is the many celebrities that were in the lobby.  Gloria finds it strange that there were celebrities in this place and wonders why they were doing here.  But she decided to brush that aside and headed to her room to begin her vacation.<br />
<br />
She got her carryon luggage and approached the elevator to head up to the third floor.  After leaving the elevator, she walked down one of the long hallways to find her appropriate room.  Finally, after a long walk, she approached the door marked 374 and inserted the key into the slot.  Once she opened the door and entered her new home, she looked around in the room so see what surprises in store for her.  Sadly however, there wasn’t much.<br />
<br />
The room was just like any other hotel room, with a master bedroom, small kitchen, bathroom, closet for her clothes, a wide screen TV, the works.  She sighed to herself, as she was a little disappointed at the room compared to the rest of the hotel.  “I thought I was going to have a room so elegant.” Gloria said a little bummed, “Oh well, I guess this will do.”  She approached the bed and placed her suitcase on the small hammock.  As she was heading the bed, there was an envelope resting on her pillow with her name on it.  Curious by this she picked up the envelope and opened it up to reveal a letter then reading it.  It says…<br />
<br />
Dear Gloria,<br />
<br />
	First of all, allow me to welcome you to the Transformation Resort.  I hope this trip is worth it.  Now I’m pretty aware that you have chosen the Gender Wing of the resort.  To that end let me give you some rules and advice.<br />
<br />
	As you already know, this resort can transform their guests into anything and anyone they want.  The Gender Wing is one of the most popular wings where guests can change their bodies into whatever they want, whether it’s a different sex or modifying their old ones.  Here are a few good examples to help you feel comfortable with your surroundings.<br />
<br />
	In the room you’re in, you can change your body to whatever you want, for privacy reasons of course.  If there were two or more people in the room, they do have a choice in changing right in front of each other or go to the private rooms we install so they won’t feel embarrassed.  As for the changes, there are different ways to change your body.<br />
<br />
	If you want to change your gender, there are a couple of ways to do it.  You can do the full change where your body will take on the shape of a different sex.  There is an option where you can be a shemale, meaning the body that’s half male and half female.  Or if you want, you can change a part of your body into that of the opposite gender.  For example, vagina to penis, flat chest to huge breasts, lean feminine body to strong masculine body, or short hair to long hair.<br />
<br />
	But changing your Gender isn’t the only thing you can do in this wing.  You can also enhance your body into what you dream of all your life.  You can have bigger breasts or penis, different body shape, much more luminous hair, or even a very beautiful face.  You can even change your race into what you truly want to be, like black, Hispanic, Japanese, Italian, etc.<br />
<br />
	Also, I know you must’ve seen all the celebrities in the lobby when you first entered the Gender Wing.  Just to answer your question Gloria, no they are not real celebrities.  They are just our guests in the bodies of celebrities.  That’s another thing the Gender Wing can do for you.  If you want, you have the option of turning your body into that of a famous movie, TV, or music star whether it’s female or male.  To ensure the safety of the guests we took the liberty in putting nametags or necklaces on them with their real names if they become movies starts, TV stars, or music stars.  Please understand the last thing we want is for crowds to cause a riot if they see what they think is a real celebrity.<br />
<br />
	Now the room isn’t the only place where you can change your body.  There are other places for you to change you body in the public view where it doesn’t have to do with nudity.  You can eat at the top restaurants, go shopping, take a swim in the pool, or go and watch some entertaining shows.  Each place has a way to change your body into the opposite gender, a better body, or a celebrity.<br />
<br />
	Once again, thank you for choosing the Transformation Resort and I hope you have yourself a safe and wonderful stay.<br />
<br />
From: The Chair of the Transformation Resort.<br />

Gloria read the letter fully and was quite impressed at what it says.  From her standpoint, she can change her body in her room into the opposite sex, a much beautiful body, or a celebrity she likes.  She was completely surprised that the were guests that want to be the celebrities they dreamed of when the watch TV, listen to music, or see in the movies, but she suspected that had something to do with this wing.  Not only that, but she can also go to a restaurant, shop, pool, or entertaining venue and change her body into whatever she wants.  She’s so pumped by this that she decided to start this experience now.  What should she do first?</p>
