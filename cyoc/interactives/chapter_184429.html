<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle parked his car on the street in front of his house when he got home. He climbed out his car, as just as he stepped onto the sidewalk, his slightly annoying neighbor&#39;s 11 year old boy named Brady barreled right into him on his bike. <br />
<br />
Kyle backwards onto his rearend, and Brady fell sideways off of his bike. The vial of potion hit the sidewalk between them, and splattered over both man and boy. <br />
<br />
Things went blank for a moment for Kyle, before he slowly picked himself back up. He was about to yell at the boy, but quickly noticed something odd. He was suddenly wearing different clothes. A black and grey North Face fleece jacket, black North Face sweat pants with a newly-torn hole in the left knee, and a pair of old New Balance sneakers nearly on their last legs. <br />
<br />
Kyle stood there gawping down at his new clothes in confusion, when he heard a man&#39;s voice:<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus kid, watch where you&#39;re going!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked up. And up. At....himself! as he watched his body stand back up, wearing his clothes! His dark spiked hair he just styled this morning, his chocolate-colored eyes, and big Italian nose. <br />
<br />
The vial and its contents faded away as it was all used up in one shot. His body sighed heavily, as it gripped his keys and walked away towards his house. Kyle just stood there on the sidewalk, next to Brady&#39;s bicycle now up at hisown now former house. He stood there with intense confusion on his new youthful 11 year old face for a minute or two, before shaking his head and looking back down at his much shorter body wearing different clothing. <br />
<br />
He touched his chest momentarily, before taking notice of his new hands. They were tiny, compared to what he was used to! His fingers long and thin. The nails a different shape, but perfectly formed. Unlike his own nails which were chewed up. <br />
<br />
It slowly dawned on Kyle as he went back to examining his much more slender body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....oh...&quot; he thought, as he caught his breath. &quot;This.....this can&#39;t be....&quot; Denial. <br />
<br />
Looking over at his car, he slowly approached it. Almost zombie-like, as he was torn between not wanting to face the truth, and needing to confirm it at the same time. <br />
<br />
He approached the reflective passenger-side window. The impossibly young face of the neighbor kid named Brady was reflected back, but in reverse. Lighter brown hair, curly but well-groomed. Clear greenish-hazel eyes with a slight hint of growing fear. A light smattering of freckles across the bridge of the small button-like nose. A really fine-looking young boy that could melt the heart of any female and make a father proud. <br />
<br />
Kyle stepped back from the vehicle, and looked over his new body again. He looked again at his child-like hands, and said under his breath:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....shit...&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked back at his reflection again in the car window. Arms at his side, and true understanding and trepidation sparkling in the eyes reflecting back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....shit....!&quot; he said again, under his breath. <br />
<br />
&quot;This....this can&#39;t be....!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brady? Brady honey! It&#39;s time for dinner!&quot; he heard the hot and still-young neighbor lady yell from her front porch for her son. <br />
<br />
Kyle paid her no mind. What, with not being used to being called &quot;Brady&quot; and all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brady! Honey! Are you ok?&quot; The concerned mother came down the steps of the front porch and began approaching Kyle. It was then that it dawned on him:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.....shit...!&quot; he said yet again under his own breath. Or rather, under Brady&#39;s breath now. He felt a quick surge in his boyhood as he discovered HE was now Brady! <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; she asked again as she bent down to examine what she thought of as her little boy, noticing that he must have fallen off his bike. It was then, that he felt pain in his left knee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you ruined your new pants! And you&#39;re knee is bleeding! Does it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda...&quot; Kyle answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you inside and cleaned up! And grab your bike and bring it up on the porch!&quot; She said as she stood back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuhhh....ok...&quot; Kyle answered in Brady&#39;s voice. Realizing he was now Brady. At least in the eyes of the world he was Brady all along. What was going to do? Stand in the middle of the sidewalk, arguing with this kid&#39;s mother, and demanding to switch back with his old body?<br />
<br />
His old body. Speaking of which, it was sorta strange that he (Brady?) acted perfectly normal as Kyle the adult, after being knocked over by the slightly annoying neighbor kid on his bike. Which was now....him! <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gotta figure this out,&quot; Kyle said to himself as he picked up the kid&#39;s bike and started wheeling it towards his new front porch, obeying the kid&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
He started lifting it up the steps, when the pain in his new knee began to explode! <br />
<br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; he yelped, as let go of the bike and sat down on the steps. He extended the leg, which was really beginning to burn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....oh....oh..&quot; he began moaning. He noticed he was beginning to..... Cry! And thought it strange. Of course, he was now an 11 year old kid, and 11 year old kids can still cry when they get hurt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Brady!&quot; his mother said from the doorway as she came back to check on her boy. &quot;Come on, buddy. It&#39;s just scraped up. Let&#39;s get you inside and cleaned up. Come on now, &quot; she said as she bent down to help him back up. <br />
<br />
Kyle leaned heavily on her, doing his best to not bend his knee as she directed him through the unfamiliar house and towards the bathroom. He sat down on the toilet with his left leg sticking out.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to take these pants off. Come on now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gently tugging then off, Kyle was now staring down at his totally unfamiliar smooth short little legs, ending in longer toes off the ends of his narrow feet. Underneath, he was wearing dark blue boxer-briefs. Seeing his new 11 year old kiddie legs made him fill with so much trepidation, it made his little penis extend under the boxer-briefs. Brady&#39;s mom did her best to ignore the fact that her little boy wasn&#39;t really a &quot;little boy&quot; much longer. Kyle was now at the very beginning stages of puberty. Again. But as a different kid. <br />
<br />
His new mother got a warm wash cloth with soap and gently cleaned his leg. The pain was searing! He sucked in his breath, and did his best to remain still. He didn&#39;t want to cry in front of his mom again. <br />
<br />
She grabbed a can of antibacterial disinfectant spray. It felt cool, and actually relieved the pain quite a bit. She then reached into the medicine cabinet amd pulled out a small box of water-resistent bandages.</p>
