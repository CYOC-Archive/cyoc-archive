<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken was able to find a baggy enough pair of sweatpants to wear, but even as he tried them out, staring at the monstrous snake hanging between his legs, he felt a chill run through him. The legs were still far too long. He&#39;d had to roll them up around his ankles. His heart sank even further as it came time to pull on his shoes and he realized they were roomier than they had been before. At least the elastic from the pants remained tight about his waist.<br />
<br />
He hurried through his house not wanting to think any further on his reduced height, packing the duffel bag in a hurry. He drove like a madman through the streets to the doctor&#39;s office. He ran a red light at one point, something completely out of character for him. Angry drivers honked in protest of his reckless behavior.<br />
<br />
Ken wasn&#39;t thinking on them, he was thinking on what might happen if this continued. Would his feet still be able to reach the pedals in a few days? He tried to quell the anxious thinking.<br />
<br />
Three inches isn&#39;t so bad. It&#39;s not all that much considering. He could live without three inches. If three turned to six though, and then continued? That&#39;s when he&#39;d start to really have problems.<br />
<br />
Well...he took a look at the thick cock between his legs; more problems than he was having currently. It looked even bigger than before, which was a distinct possibility.  He slammed his sweaty palms against the steering wheel.<br />
<br />
Ken burnt rubber pulling into the parking lot. He slammed the car door closed and marched into the building, one arm holding onto the baggy sweat pants in order to keep them from slipping down his waist. They must have been baggier than he thought, though they did little to hid the outline of the monstrous cock poking through them.<br />
<br />
He ran into the doctor down the hall and felt like creaming him. &quot;What have you done to me? I&#39;m-I&#39;m a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor tapped his clipboard. &quot;You&#39;re just in time, please come into the next room and disrobe so we can get a good look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken stared. Just yesterday, he&#39;d towered over the small roughly shaven man in spectacles, and now they were staring eye-to-eye. He gulped, realizing in the drive over he&#39;d must have lost even more height. The sobering thought made him somehow even more compliant to the doctor&#39;s orders.<br />
<br />
He would do anything to fix this.<br />
<br />
Inside the examination room, Ken was instructed to disrobe and lie flat against the table.  Ken removed his now loose-fitting shirt and found the sweatpants slid off his body with ease, only getting caught on his cock which know dangled between his knees. It was most certainly bigger now.  He slid out of his shoes like they were merely slippers.<br />
<br />
He hoisted himself up onto the examination table with more effort than it&#39;d taken yesterday. He laid there shivering in the cold light while the doctor took down his measurements and compared them against his clipboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve lost five inches of height in total, and your cock is now sixteen inches long,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;How big did you say you were when you called?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three inches lost,&quot; Ken stammered nervously. &quot;Doc what&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ll need to keep you over night to test my theory,&quot; the doctor said clicking his tongue. &quot;But it&#39;d appear the rate of growth has slowed tapered off today, though you&#39;re still shrinking at the same rate. Oh this won&#39;t do  at all. Our clients won&#39;t mind giving up three inches of mass for eight inches of cock, but an equal exchange rate is out of the question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So!&quot; Ken sat up sharply. &quot;Fix me! I don&#39;t want a foot and a half long cock! I don&#39;t want to be a midget!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, five inches of height lost will be seen as unacceptable.&quot; The doctor stroked his chin. &quot;Very well, I&#39;ll need you to sign an additional waiver for more experimental drug testing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you can grow me back,&quot; Ken said, licking his lips nervously. &quot;People will definitely notice. Don&#39;t know if I can face my friends like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s simply not possible right now.&quot; The doctor handed him a clipboard with even more forms to sign. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that your height is gone forever. These documents will however allow us to administer a serum that should hopefully reduce any further cock growth and shrinkage. You&#39;ll go back to normal and the experiment will be considered a success and you&#39;ll be rewarded substantially. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken closed his eyes and sighed. &quot;All right. That&#39;s better than nothing.&quot; He scratched his name at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; The doctor was on him in an instant injecting his shoulder with the serum.<br />
<br />
Ken winced rubbing his shoulder. &quot;Ah! Little warning huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it have helped?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not.&quot; Ken shook his head.<br />
<br />
He remained within the laboratory over night. Various people in lab coats came in to check on him occasionally and marked down notes on their clipboards during the day before leaving him in the darkness on a hospital bed that night.<br />
<br />
Ken found sleeping difficult. He had several nightmares of being trapped in a dollhouse with massive eyes peering through the windows at him. As he tried to get up and run away he found his cock expanding massively between his legs until it became larger than his entire body, rendering him immobile. He was then scooped up into giant hands by his dick and toyed with. He woke covered in sweat and had to do several comparisons against the bed to ensure he hadn&#39;t shrunk any further.<br />
<br />
When in the morning it was revealed that his condition hadn&#39;t changed, he felt a small twinge of relief. The doctor of course told him to contact him later that day if any changes occurred, but they hoped that this would be the last of his testing adventures. He went home, still feeling freakish about his massive endowment, but grateful that none of this would be continuing.<br />
<br />
He tried going throughout the rest of the day, taking things easy and getting accustomed to what his new life might be. All the while he kept telling himself that it&#39;d be worth it. The money would help pay off his college debts and set him up probably for life. It was difficult when he&#39;d feel his cock head brush against his knee, or he&#39;d reach for something and it&#39;d be further away than he was accustomed, all signs a constant reminder that his life would be different now.<br />
<br />
Watching television in the living room wasn&#39;t helping at all. He kept flicking through channels with male enhancement commercials promising their customers larger cocks. He smirked and swore under his breath, aware of the tragic irony. It was when he came across an episode of Captain Planet that his smile vanished altogether. It was the episode where two of the kids shrink and have to crawl out of their own clothes.<br />
<br />
He switched off the television and threw the remote across the room. He thought about just going to bed. The whole day was spent lying around being depressed. He hoped tomorrow would be better.<br />
<br />
Ken stood and his pants immediately fell to his ankles. His blood ran cold as he looked over the rest of his clothing. His shirt fit him like a nightgown, and the sleeves fell over his wrists. He immediately checked his cock. He couldn&#39;t tell if it had grown any or not, but it certainly looked bigger in relation to the rest of him.</p>
