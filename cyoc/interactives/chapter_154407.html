<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fox proved to be a welcome distraction, and her transformation had resulted in a very doglike personality. Anna seemed to be the favorite, and she named their new pet Flame.<br />
<br />
Now well rested, the fembois spent a lot of the time binge eating. Sean had made a grocery run that morning and the kitchen was well stocked. Nothing had been discussed, but they all knew that friends would be arriving and would need to be converted. Their gluttony, combined with a relative period of abstinence, had all of the fembois nuts swelling with seed. A tightness inside hinted that the rest of their ejaculate producing anatomy was brimming with potency.<br />
<br />
As the sun set, they heard car doors and someone enter through the garage.<br />
<br />
Kyra was the first in, carrying a stack of pizza boxes. She was a tall girl, rail thin. Her hair was dyed black, a helmet bob cut.  <br />
Her eyes were large and expressive, a deep brown that seemed to almost blend into the black of her pupil. Her lips were thin, deep red with lipstick. Both ears were adorned with many piercings. Dark eye makeup and a lace choker added to the goth look. She stopped in her tracks as she caught sight of the nude fembois lounging in the living room.<br />
<br />
Mitch ran into her back. His short stature made it difficult for him to see around Kyra. He was tiny for a guy, 5&#39;3&quot; with a small frame. His light brown hair was cropped close in an attempt to look more masculine. Piercing ice blue eyes, small perfect nose, pouty lips, oval face, and a soft jaw made his face a model of androgynous beauty.<br />
<br />
Liv was last. She had straight shoulder length white blonde hair, gray eyes, and an otherwise average forgettable face. Her weight problem was apparent, and carried almost exclusively in her belly and chest. If it wasn&#39;t for the degree to which her stomach sagged, she could be mistaken for pregnant.<br />
<br />
Kyra&#39;s eyes locked on Erin and widened. Despite her crush&#39;s drastic changes she immediately recognized her. &#39;Holy shit! I half expected this to be an elaborate prank. That dick can&#39;t be a trick.&#39;<br />
<br />
In the back Sean snickered and chimed in &#39;nope, it&#39;s a treat!&#39;. Eyes rolled at the terrible joke but the ice was broken.<br />
<br />
Anna stepped up and started laying out the pizza boxes on the table. &#39;let&#39;s eat and I&#39;ll explain. You three should pig out, you&#39;ll need the calories later&#39;<br />
<br />
Anna, Jess, and Erin began telling their story from the beginning. As they reached the point of their decision to leave campus, Kyra interrupted. She was seated on the edge of the sofa, next to the flattened form of Kat, who had slept through the newcomers arrival.<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s wild, but it doesn&#39;t explain the giant anatomically correct Halloween costume.&#39; She grabbed Kat&#39;s solid rubber dildo-cock in emphasis.<br />
<br />
This roused Kat, and in a few seconds she had expanded and rose to a sitting posture. Kyra screamed and fell backwards, frantically scrambling away from the hulking living suit. Mitch and Liv also tensed in alarm, which turned to confusion as the rest of the group busted out laughing.<br />
<br />
Kat stretched slowly and extensively, showing off her size and mock musculature. &#39;mmmmmmm, you should have woke me when our new fucktoys arrived.&#39;<br />
<br />
Anna interjected. &#39;This is Kat, she had her own adventure and ended up changed a lot more than we did.&#39; There was a moment of silence as they waited for Kat to speak up, but she had settled back down on the couch and was silent.<br />
<br />
Anna launched into retelling Kat&#39;s story. During this Liv in particular could not take her eyes off the bizarre feline creature.<br />
<br />
At the conclusion, Liv spoke up - eyes still locked on Kat&#39;s glossy form. &#39;Wow, to hell with being a femboi, I want to be a kitty fuck monster.&#39; the desire was thick in her voice. This hooked into deep dark corners of her psyche. The thought of completely losing her humanity was terrifying, but the thought of that power was enticing. She had been hurt before and the thought of never being hurt again was liberating.<br />
<br />
Kat launched off the couch and pounced Liv, pinning her to the floor.<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you worthy? Let me look.&#39; Kat&#39;s huge handpaws gripped each side of Liv&#39;s head. The girl was acutely aware that the creature could pop her head like a balloon. <br />
<br />
&#39;Playful yet introverted. Selfish, arrogant, and proud of your accomplishments - but with a lazy streak that causes the failures for which you make excuses. Loyal to your friends but indifferent to everyone else. Under it all a driving motivation you admit to no one.&#39; Kat&#39;s deep purring voice softened with the last part.<br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;d make a wonderful cat. Are you sure you want this?&#39;<br />
<br />
Liv stared up at Kat, her eyes tracing across the long silver saber teeth curving down and the blindfold permanently fused over where her eyes would have been.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes.&#39;<br />
<br />
In a flash, the hooks on Kat&#39;s corset unlatched and her torso flexed open. A web of ropes and straps looped Liv and snapped her up and inside. This was so quick that the girl seemed to vanish.<br />
<br />
The rest of the room gasped and shouted. <br />
<br />
Kat stood, there was no hint of Liv&#39;s body inside. &#39;She wanted this&#39;. Kat settled back down onto the couch cushions, ignoring the continued questions and exclamations from the onlookers.<br />
<br />
This slowly settled, and the group wandered off into pairs and trios.<br />
<br />
Erin and Kyra went upstairs into one of the bedrooms. They locked the door behind them to ensure privacy. Erin sat down on the bed and held out her hand. Kyra sat down, unsure how to proceed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Kyra, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll never forget that sleepover in 8th grade when you explained that you loved me. That you wanted to be much more than friends. I can&#39;t imagine how much it has hurt you in all the years since to have remained best friends in the face of that unrequited love.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I wasn&#39;t a pretty girl, and you still wanted me. Wanted me for who I was inside. But love always has a physical component too, and I couldn&#39;t return your passion. I couldn&#39;t help being only interested in guys, any more than you could stop being attracted to girls.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But I&#39;ve thought about you a lot since I changed. I get it now, and I&#39;m not just talking about being attracted to girls. And I am really really into girls now.&#39; This caused Kyra to smile wider.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m ready to return your love, if you are willing to have me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Kyra leaned in and kissed the naked femboi in front of her. &#39;You&#39;re still the same girl I have always wanted even though you hardly look like your yearbook photo. I absolutely will.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;I am very attracted to the new you, I&#39;m bi, so the new equipment down there is still just fine. Not to mention those rock hard abs and pecs.&#39; She smirked.<br />
<br />
Kyra leaned in and fondled Erin&#39;s grapefruit sized nuts. &#39;Amazing to think what is in here and what it will do to me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Kyra reached down and grabbed the bottom of her sweatshirt.</p>
