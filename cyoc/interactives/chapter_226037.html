<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There are many possible options to include, so I will leave it blank for anyone who wants to continue creating their own.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decided that the first thing she would do was take your luggage to your room and get some rest, so you went to your room in the cabin where you would be staying. However, you weren&#39;t the only one to think about it nor was the fastest, as Niko followed in front of you, heading in the same direction. <br />
<br />
Eventually Niko took a photo out of his pocket (the possession of cell phones and other electronic equipment that allowed participants to communicate with outside the island was prohibited) and looked at it. It was the image of a Cyclops man, tall (being 8 feet tall) and with a single huge eye on his face instead of the two of a normal person.  He wore a tight shirt, which left the defined muscles of his chest and four arms clearly visible, and in his tight pants, the bulge formed by his large dick was perfectly visible, which flaccidly ran down his leg to his knee.<br />
<br />
Being just behind Niko, you recognized the cyclops from the photo and said &quot;I remember her, this is Shannon who was on this reality show two seasons ago.  I remember her when she started, she was a very sexy petite girl, but with little style, and I didn&#39;t believe she would go this far, but she surprised me.  The shapes she took and her creativity during sex were much better than expected and she was one of my favorites from that season.  Too bad she only came in 5th place and this Cyclops was her when she was eliminated from the competition. Are you a fan of hers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly.  We are neighbors and she is the main reason I signed up for this reality show.  We are very good friends, although I wish things were different.&quot; Niko said with a regretful tone at the end<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem a little dejected about this.  I&#39;m sorry for being nosy and you don&#39;t have to answer if you don&#39;t want to, but could you tell me why you&#39;re so dejected?&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Turns out I&#39;m in love with her.  We were already very good friends before she participated in the reality show and, when she went away and left her house alone for a few months, I decided that since she was single and not in a relationship with anyone, I would confess my feelings as soon as possible. she came back. I had already heard about this reality show at the time but I didn&#39;t follow it, so I didn&#39;t know that she was one of the participants, so it was a huge shock when I saw this Cyclops arrive at her house and I found out that he was Shannon herself, that she had decided to keep the body she had when she was eliminated and assumed a new identity, now his name is Kyle. Despite everything that saddened me most was that she was now completely a man and I&#39;m not gay.  I couldn&#39;t hide my disappointment.&quot; Niko said<br />
<br />
&quot;What a shame.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s exactly what she said when I told her about my feelings for her and apologized, but as the rules of the event dictate that an eliminated participant&#39;s decision is final, so she had no way of returning to her old self.  We remain friends and very close, but it&#39;s not the same.  She has completely taken over her life as a man, but I can&#39;t forget the old her in my heart, and whenever I talk to her, I call her Shannon and treat her like a woman.  Maybe it&#39;s because of the feeling of guilt and disappointment that her change has left me with that she still allows only me to treat her like a woman and call her by her old name. Shannon has already told me that, as a man, she is not gay and she is interested in women, but only with me she opened up a few times and allowed me to fuck her ass, which I did imagining her old self.&quot; Niko said<br />
<br />
&quot;Things must be difficult for you.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;More for me than for her.  Imagine my despair when she started going out with girls, the fear of her being taken away from me, even though she was now a man and the situation made a relationship between the two of us impossible.  That&#39;s when I made the decision to participate in this reality show, hoping to become an ideal partner for her.&quot; Niko said<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.  I hope you get what you are looking for.  Your motivation is better than mine, as I came more for fun.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;And I came to combine the useful with the pleasant.&quot; said Rosa, who was catching up with you carrying the luggage that she would store in her room too<br />
<br />
&quot;What form would that be?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard the announcer say that I&#39;m a single mother of two children, right?  My daughters are twin girls who are currently 11 years old, and I have had to work very hard and practically without rest for all these years. I had been feeling very stressed lately and a co-worker of mine recommended that, after finding out that I was a bit naughty but didn&#39;t have the conditions or time for an active sex life, I participated in this reality show, as this way I could relieve all the stress. and, if everything goes well, get some good money.  For this I left my daughters in the care of my mother until I left the island.&quot; Rosa said<br />
<br />
You continued talking to Niko and Rosa for a while, until you realized it was getting really late.  You all said goodbye and entered your respective rooms. You opened your suitcase and opened space between the contents, which contained practically only sex toys and no clothes, since after taking off the ones you arrived on the island with, you couldn&#39;t get dressed again, just as the clothes wouldn&#39;t fit with the daily changes. that you would go through.<br />
<br />
You then undressed and looked at yourself in a mirror installed in the room, which allowed you to easily see your entire body, saying goodbye to being a &quot;normal&quot; and excited girl imagining what it would be like when you woke up the next morning. He soon went to bed thinking that he would have difficulty sleeping due to the anxiety, but he fell into a dreamless sleep and before you knew it it was already morning and it was time to get up.<br />
