<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh that smells so good,” Martha inhaling the delicious smells as she and her husband stepped inside their home. Both enjoying a rather vigorous night of lovemaking at the Twists with a friend of theirs; William and Martha were looking for a relaxing moment to eat some breakfast before heading over to the town’s picnic.<br />
<br />
“The bacon on the frying pan,” William comments; “or Eric and his girls scents?”<br />
“The bacon,” Martha rolling her eyes; “and yes I still smell that wonderful aphrodisiac scent of theirs, but at the moment; I’m sated with all the sex we had last night.”<br />
“We heard that,” Eric shouting from the kitchen; “Breakfast is almost ready!”<br />
<br />
Entering the kitchen, William and Martha see Eric, Frieda and Spencer doing their best to make some eggs and bacon. The three fully dressed and in their human forms; while Nate and Jean, sitting at the table were still in their fursonas. Nate a werewolf, while Jean was a were-lioness; both having a spirited night of rutting, the two have every intention of continuing their fun in privacy of Nate’s bedroom.<br />
“Fun night you two,” Martha speaking as she and William sat down at the table.<br />
“You don’t know the half of it,” Nate managing a smile through his lupine muzzle.<br />
“Oh I can imagine,” William chuckling; “your mother and I…”<br />
“No need to give details,” Nate cutting his father off; “despite the heavy scent of sex in the air here, I can smell the fun you two had last night.”<br />
“With a were-cheetah no less,” Jean speaking as she sips the coffee Nate prepared earlier; “smells familiar.”<br />
<br />
Nate looks at Jean questioningly as she continues to sip her coffee. While Jean was mated to him; the were-lioness was still bisexual and wanted to sample honey from other ladies. A fact that was re-enforced last night when she expressed an interest in joining in on Eric’s three way with Frieda and Spencer.<br />
“You have had had another dalliance with the female sex,” Nate looking at Jean.<br />
“Before I met I you,” Jean commenting; “you already know of Liv.”<br />
“Inside and out,” Nate sighing; “that were-leopard friend of yours is quite the pawful.”<br />
“That is true,” Jean nodding; “but the were-cheetah smell your parents have on them, its familiar.”<br />
“She was a friend of Samantha and Frances Twist,” Martha speaking up; “and we had a wonderful time last night.”<br />
“Let’s not have this conversation,” William shaking his head; “Breakfast first.”<br />
<br />
Both parents get up to take over from Eric, Frieda and Spencer making breakfast. However, as William started helping Martha the doorbell rings.<br />
“Well who could it be at this hour,” William heading to the door.<br />
Opening up the front door, William could see a man at his door. Rather plain looking, his noticeable feature was the one blue eye and the other green. It took a moment for William before he recognized the man not in a suit.<br />
“Jack Johnson,” William speaking; “what do I owe this early hour visit? It’s not in regards to Julie Stovall is it,” William shaking the man’s hand.<br />
<br />
“No,” Jack answering; “that girl got what was coming to her. I’m sad that I wasn’t able to prosecute her due to a technicality.”<br />
“That and the council felt there was enough evidence to put the girl on trial for Statue 1A,” William exiting the house and closing the door.<br />
“Regardless of the circumstances,” Jack answering; “that is done and dealt with. I’m here on a another matter.”<br />
“And what would that be,” William asking.<br />
“My father is your next door neighbor,” Jack sighing; “he called me up last night to complain over the lack of police action regarding the noise coming from you house.”<br />
“Old man Johnson is your father,” William looking shocked; “that makes you…”<br />
“The family-were,” Jack answering; “let’s not get into that. My parents are not in in good health. Mom is recovering from a broken leg and my dad has high cholesterol.”<br />
“So that is why he is always grumpy,” William looking at the were-cat in his human form.<br />
“Lack of sleep from loud animal noises,” Jack shaking his head; “tends to do that. I know we are under a were-alert,” Jack speaking; “so not being able to go outside after dark in our fursona’s tends to limit our options in expending extra energy.”<br />
“It’s next to impossible to stay silent when rutting,” William speaking; “the animal in us wants to announce itself during the act of mating.”<br />
“I told my father this last night,” Jack sighing; “not as in depth as you just put it, but telling my father to get noise cancelling headphones?”<br />
“I admit that was a little out of line,” William apologizing; “but when you arrive home from a walk to see a man banging on your door shouting and screaming to be heard, you tend to throw civility out the window.”<br />
“Yeah that was an error on his part,” Jack shaking his head; “just keep the noise down will you?”<br />
“Martha and I will,” William answering; “but I can’t speak for Nate or his mate, Jean Talbot.”<br />
<br />
Jack blanched at hearing the name Talbot. Knowing that Jean was the daughter of Leon Talbot, the were-lion king and a council rep; Jack knew better not to piss of the man. With his son Peter in the hospital after getting shot by Daniel Parker, and now the mobster Freddie the Shark in town trying to get his son out of jail. Jack wasn’t interested in getting on the wrong paw with Leon.<br />
“Please,” Jack asking nicely; “keep the noise down during the duration of the were-alert. For my parent’s health at least?”<br />
“I’ll talk to my sons,” William speaking; “but with school starting tomorrow, your parents should have a few night of peace as he is buried in home work and his after school job.<br />
<br />
With the two shaking hands, William watches as Jack heads next door to his parents’ house before going back inside his home. Seeing the dining room table set and breakfast ready, William heads over to join in.<br />
“Who was at the door,” Martha speaking; putting down a large bowl of scrambled eggs.<br />
“Jack Johnson,” William answering; “his father is old man Johnson. He wants us to tone the noise down with all the rutting that has been going on.”<br />
“Why not,” Nate snorting; “ask for water to flow uphill or werewolf pack to go completely vegan.”<br />
“Don’t be crass with this,” William diving up some eggs; “you and Jean do make a lot of noise when rutting.”<br />
“No more than the next couple,” Nate smiling through his muzzle; as he gnaws on a strip of bacon.<br />
“Be that as it may,” William sighing; “use the basement for your fun times from here on out. That goes for you three as well,” William looking at Eric, Spencer and Frieda.<br />
“Kind of hard when its occupied,” Nate grumbling.<br />
“We can always have fun at my place,” Jean giving a sly wink.<br />
“That also works,” William answering; “our next door neighbors are not in the greatest of health and need their rest. Starting today,” William stating; &quot;tone down the noise making.&quot;<br />
“Guess that means we are taking our love in,” Nate grinning; “back to your place Jean.”<br />
“Family dinner later this evening,” Martha speaking up; scraping the plate with her knife as she cuts through a large chunk of egg. “Don’t be late.”<br />
“You’re not going to the picnic,” Eric looking at his brother.<br />
“The picnic is the one time we can be in our fursona outside during the day,” Jean grumbling; “that won’t be happening with the were-alert under effect.”</p>
