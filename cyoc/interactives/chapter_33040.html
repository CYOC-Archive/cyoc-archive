<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She came to a small pen full of piglets! And they looked so hungry too. Whoever was in charge of running this store had really neglected these poor things. Just as Amy began wishing there was something she could do she felt a stirring in her udders. They were beginning to fill up again! Her body was apparently responding on its own to the plight of the starving piglets!<br />
<br />
She knew the best thing to do would be to walk away from the situation, it could only lead to trouble. But the pleading eyes of the piglets were overwhelming, as if they new why her breasts were swelling.<br />
<br />
Giving in to the maternal urge, she knelt down and stuck a few teats through the mesh fencing. The piglets leaped at the offer and began tugging ravenously at her teats. This was much rougher than the milking machine had been, but Amy knew it was for a good cause. The piglets were fighting to get to the eight teats she offered and she could see many of them stuck in the back unable to reach her nourishing milk. Pulling against the hungry mouths, she pulled her top breasts away from the fencing and decided to try to feed more at once. She stepped over the low fence and into the cool brown mud holding pen. She was immediately swarmed by piglets, many fighting for a spot at her lower udder, but most jumped at her legs, trying to reach her breast-udders. More hungry piggies ran out from the small hut in one of the corners of the pen running into the ruckus. Amy began to get second thoughts about coming in here, but the weight of the piglets became to much for her and forced her down onto her rump with a *splat*. They bull rushed her chest, forcing her down onto her side, her right arm disappearing in the mud as they swarmed her breasts, grabbing at her teats painfully with their mouths. Startled, she instinctively shot out a spray of stink from some gland beneath her muddy skunk tail, but the piglets were undeterred, they knew what they wanted and nothing was going to stop them!<br />
<br />
It felt to Amy like her udders were being torn apart as the piglets fought over her milk. A few pigs had trampled one of her hoof-hands when they knocked her over, and she licked it with her thick tongue trying to assuage the pain. She could hear a scuffle develop behind her udder and gasped in shock as she felt on piglet push another right into her enlarged womanhood! She tried reaching down to push them away, but was held in place by the pigs at her breasts. Instead Amy slid her body a few inches away from the fighters, hoping to avoid any other invasions of her privates. But the dueling kept on and the muddy piglets continued slipping into her huge womanhood, startling her. She could feel her gigantic warm womanhood enveloping them before they managed to free themselves, their muddy bristles sending undeniable pleasure to her brain. Pleasurable though it was, she tried brushing them away from her breasts to escape this madness, but more jumped in as soon as she moved some away. <br />
<br />
Then Amy noticed something else, her body had apparently recognized the fight for teats and was beginning to respond to it! She could feel new teats begin pulsing out all over her body! Not only could she feel them filling out beneath her first two pairs of breasts, but they began to swell up from her back as well! She could feel the piglets sucking from new teats all over her body, but the flood of sensations was to immense for her to pinpoint them. Suddenly the fighting ceased, apparently each piggy had somehow found an available teat. She could feel tiny mouths tugging her teats all over her body! She must have been milking at nearly 80 piglets at once! <br />
<br />
The piglets slowly disbanded one by one walking into a corner or back into the hut, groggy with bellies full of Amy's milk. After most of the piglets sludged away Amy jumped at the chance and ripped the last few piglets away from her sore teats and hurriedly stepped over the low fencing.<br />
<br />
She collapsed on the other side, part from sore exhaustion, part because she was half covered in slippery mud, and part from the new weight of her body. Even with her breasts and udders empty, she felt like she had gained at least another 50 pounds of loose flesh. She sat up and braced herself with her arms as she took in her situation. She had grown another two pair of breasts underneath her first two sets, each of these topped with four teats. Another three pair also protruded from her back beginning just below her shoulder blades. The teats of the bottom pair touched the cold of the tiled floor as she leaned back. Amy noticed that she also now sported a set of four teats on each of her hips, although the udders there were much smaller than the others and didn't stick out much. Bringing her knees up she could see two more sets of teats hanging at each knee-cap, similar to those on her hips the udders there were also less developed. Altogether she had 76 teats! Her entire right side was absolutely covered in mud except for her teats that were sucked clean. Her tail also sagged from all the mud in it and her groin felt very dirty, covered in mud, with some inside her as well!<br />
<br />
Amy turned and saw the piglets napping. She couldn't help but feel some strange sort of maternal pride that she had been able to feed those starving creatures. She needed to move on, the mud was beginning to cake to her body and she needed to find somewhere to wash off soon!</p>
