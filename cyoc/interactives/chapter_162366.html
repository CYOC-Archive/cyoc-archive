<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was lead back into the dungeons, walking at the witch&#39;s heels. This time around, she was much less considerate than when he&#39;d first met her. She strode forward without care for his stumbling behind her. Whenever he fell too far behind, his collar tensed and forced him forward at a faster pace, as if he wore an invisible, magical leash. He was so preoccupied with this struggle that he lost track of where he even was.<br />
The vampiress took him out into some room in the dungeons. He couldn&#39;t really explain it better than that. It appeared to be the lowest floor of a tower; it was entirely cylindrical, with a perfectly circular floor plan. What appeared to be some kind of ritual circle was painted in the center, with a five-pointed star in the middle. It might&#39;ve been painted in blood, but it was really impossible to tell.<br />
&quot;In the center you go.&quot; The witch didn&#39;t even bother to be polite or respectful or anything. She simply ordered him forward with a curt wave of her hand, and, well, Ty did as he was ordered. With this cursed collar around his neck, it wasn&#39;t like he had much of a choice. Ty walked into the center of the circle and dropped to his knees.<br />
<br />
The vampiress witch began to chant, softly at first, but growing louder and stronger and more confident. A dark, cruel energy began to flood through Ty&#39;s body, almost making him want to shudder in disgust. But it simply kept coming. It felt as if something was crawling through his skin, under every square inch, making him want to hurl and cry out and destroy something, all at the same time.<br />
Then, he began to change. He felt a growth spurt as he grew significantly taller. His body fleshed out, and his muscles expanded severely. Then, less...typical changes. Bone burst forth from his temples, making him howl in pain as massive, curved horns erupted from his head. His face transformed completely, jutting outward into a muzzle. His teeth grew stronger and flatter, his nose wider, his jaw broader. Fur quickly enveloped his face, running down to his neck. His feet transformed completely, reshifting in seconds into heavy, loud hooves. Fur covered his legs as well, but left much of his chest, arms, and shoulders bare.<br />
His cock changed as well. It had grown longer and larger in his initial growth, but now, it reshaped. The cock quickly receded into the wrinkled brown flesh of his new sheath. It didn&#39;t stay sheathed for long, though, as the adrenaline of transformation sent blood to his loins. His cock emerged in the light once more, in a new form: a horsecock, huge, mottled-skinned, a flat flared head, and several rings around the base of the shaft. His balls grew as well, becoming larger, heavier, and furrier. The musk of a powerful male quickly filled the ritual circle, filling his nostrils and making himself grow even harder as he did.<br />
Invigorated with the power in his new body, Ty lifted his head to the roof and let out a huge roar, shaking the very building to its foundations. Though he couldn&#39;t see himself directly, he could feel his new body and he knew what had happened. He was a minotaur. A big one. And a virile one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like the big boy enjoys his new body...&quot; The witch mused, walking in a wide circle around Ty. &quot;Hold still for a moment.&quot; She waved a hand and called out another spell. Suddenly, new bindings appeared around each of Ty&#39;s wrists, chaining him to the stone floor. He let out another furious roar and shook at his chains, but couldn&#39;t get them to budge.<br />
The vampiress then waved her hand, and a shimmering portal disappeared. She reached one hand through and pulled another figure out. It was a woman, completely nude and bound tightly in leather and steel. The small human part left in Ty&#39;s minotaur brain vaguely recognized her to be Erica, his longtime friend. The witch rolled Erica onto all fours and pushed her into the ritual circle with an amused chuckle. &quot;Enjoy, my pet. She&#39;s all yours.&quot;<br />
Ty didn&#39;t even take time to consider it. Lust coursed ferociously through his body, sending his cock surging to the hardness of steel between his legs. He grabbed Erica by the neck with one massive shackled hand, and guided his huge horsecock against her pussy. He barely managed to line his huge flared tip against her cunt before he drove forth, eliciting a huge cry from the girl beneath him. He broke out into deep, bestial thrusts, absolutely destroying the small woman impaled on his horsecock and forcing it practically up to her womb. The beast inside of him- and outside, now- didn&#39;t care about her pleasure, or what was expected of him. He used her as long as he wanted, and came when he wanted to. For this first orgasm in his new body, he didn&#39;t last long- several minutes of fierce pumping and thrusting was all it took before he was bottoming out in her cunt, pumping buckets of cum within her.<br />
<br />
Before much longer, Ty pulled his softening cock from her pussy and pushed Erica away, not even caring about the girl who used to be his friend. He then became fixated on his chains once more, yanking at them furiously before letting another roar loose at the vampiress.<br />
&quot;Oh, no need to be so antsy, boy,&quot; the witch purred. She waved her hand to create another teleportation portal, and blinked Erica away to God-knows-where. &quot;I did just treat you, did I not? Now let me explain... you serve our lord, Count Raunr, now. You&#39;ll be a nice little bodyguard for us. Kill adventurers who seek his head. Fuck them, if you like. Either way, this is your new life. So, welcome, my child.&quot;</p>
