<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tora Tachibana was reviewing the purchase orders for were-birth control pills and accompanying records for the pharmacy that Helen had her Prescription filled. He did not like what he saw; Orders for the pills filled out, yet the inventory of Tachibana medical supplies show very little in stock depletion. Staring at the Pharmacist, a fellow were-fox; Tora shakes his head as he put the records down.<br />
“Why is there a discrepancy in your records regarding the were-birth control pills,” doctor Tora staring at the pharmacist.<br />
“Simple,” the pharmacist responds; “cost. Most of the members of our community can not afford the pills. Because of that we have provided them with a generic alternative.”<br />
“What,” Tora looking shocked; what did you just say?”<br />
“Let me explain, the pharmacist staring down the doctor; “every drug has a brand name and a generic variety. The brand name is manufactured by the company that created it and the generic variety is not.”<br />
“I’m well aware of that,” Tora Tachibana looking unamused; “explain to me how you have been providing the town’s citizens with a generic version of the were-birth control pill.”<br />
“We make it in house,” The pharmacist answers; “as a chemist as well as a medical advisor, its not illegal for us to provide customers with a cheaper alternative. I’m sure you are well aware of the practice of Pharmacy compounding.”<br />
<br />
Tora Tachibana was floored at what the pharmacist just said. The art and science of preparing personalized medications for patients. Compounded medications are made based on a practitioner’s prescription in which individual ingredients are mixed together in the exact strength and dosage form required by the patient.<br />
“It’s all well and good to do that when filling out a prescription for Tylenol-3,“ Tora seething; “but this is specialized medicine whose formula is a closely guarded Tachibana secret. How were you able to crack the formula?”<br />
“Reverse engineering,” The pharmacist now sensing Tora’s anger; “and before you start trying to rip my throat out, answer me this. Is the were-birth control pill patented? Approval for use by the FDA?”<br />
<br />
Tora glares at the pharmacist as he growls menacingly; knowing the pharmacist was smart in launching the legal barrage, the doctor phrases his next question carefully.<br />
“Do you craft the pills for the hybrid were’s,” Tora almost barking at the man; “do you take into consideration a hybrids unique physiology and hormones?”<br />
“We haven’t gotten that far yet,” the pharmacist starting to snarl back at the doctor; “you mind explaining as to why you are auditing my records and asking me all these questions?”<br />
<br />
“Helen Tompkins,” Tora Tachibana snaps back; “she purchased her prescription of were-rabbit birth control pills from here a few days ago.”<br />
“What of it,” the pharmacist asking.<br />
“The pills Helen had been given,” Tora snarling; “were for a were-lioness. Now she lies in a hospital safe room,” doctor Tora now shouting; “suffering through a heat cycle that has the same symptoms of an incomplete transformation. NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I’M ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS? Doctor Tompkins could die because of your meddling,” Tora Tachibana holding back from shifting into his were-fox fursona.<br />
<br />
The Pharmacist looked on shocked; creating generic varieties of the were-birth control for a few months now, he was completely stunned at making the wrong pills for a were-rabbit.<br />
“I-I didn’t know,” The pharmacist unable to come up with an answer.<br />
“Its because you are nothing more than a chemist,” Tora snapping; “you had no earthly ideal how precise the were-birth control pills have to be. This isn’t like making an anti-inflammatory drug,” Tora unimpressed with the pharmacist’s meekness; “this is complex drug that needs to be tailored made to each specific strain of the were-virus. Unlike a normal, us were’s are extremely fertile. The females don’t have a monthly menstrual cycle and we can’t exactly put on a condom and go at each other in the traditional sense. Without the were-birth control pill; ovulation for a female upon orgasming once a male penetrates her is all but assured!”<br />
“Yet the pills are too expensive for some,” the pharmacist pleads; “for some struggling families they cost more than their monthly bills combined. And that’s only for the adults with a job,” the pharmacist speaking; “for a young female-were still in school…”<br />
<br />
The pharmacist let that sentence hang, hoping to get some sympathy from the angry doctor.<br />
“As of this moment,” Tora Tachibana in an ill mood; “you are here by barred from dispensing the were-birth control pill to our town’s citizens. Your stock will be seized and your store shut down, pending an extensive audit in your finances. Expect a call from my grandmother,” Tora growling; “the skulk leader and CEO of Tachibana Enterprises. I will however,” Tora Tachibana showing a little mercy; “inform her of the cost of the medication and look at options for reducing the cost and offering rebates for low income families. But you are in no way off the hook in this regard.”<br />
<br />
Doctor Tachibana left the pharmacy that was located in Moon Lake’s downtown core. Completely ashamed that a fellow were-fox and skulk member could so blatantly try and make a cheaper version of a highly sensitive contraceptive pill. Despite his heart being in the right place; the pharmacist was only a chemist. The were-birth control pill from what Tora Tachibana could recall was made by a doctor and an expert in chemical biology.<br />
“There are many nuances to take into account when developing the contraceptive,” Tora sighs; “I only hope Helen was the only person to receive the wrong batch.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Back in the hospital safe room Helen was just starting to come out of the sedative Doctor Tora gave her a few hours ago. Feeling groggy and in desperate need for relief; Helen starts to mumble for Peter, only to her surprise hearing him answer her. Her eyes open and now wide awake; she sees the were-lion who’s musky scent and large member driving her wild with a primal need, standing at the edge of the bed she was lying on.<br />
“Please Peter,” Helen begging; “I need you.”<br />
<br />
Peter for the most part stares at Helen as she continues to beg and plead for his seed. Taking a deep breath and drinking in her heady scent; the were-lion roars with desire. Despite his legs still shaky from the sedative that he too received earlier; Peter leaps onto the bed. Landing on top of Helen Tompkins and ripping her clothes off to expose her entire body for his pleasure.<br />
<br />
For Helen; seeing the were-lion pouncing and roaring, made the rabbit with in her afraid and scared beyond belief. Screaming as she watches Peter remove her clothes; her terrified nature soon turns to confusion as she sees Peter gently caressing her body. Taking care to not harm her as he runs his paws all over; exploring every curve and stimulating her arousal further. Instinctively spreading her legs; Helen watches as Peter places his nose at Helen’s swollen and engorged sex. Getting a stronger hit of her scent; Helen gasps as she feels Peter’s rough tongue run over her lips and clitoris, sampling her leaking juices and growling with approval.<br />
<br />
Panting as she stares at the leonine eyes looking back at her; Helen’s own body eagerly anticipating what was to come next, she pleads to Peter. Begging him to give her what she craves as her body rapidly shifts into her were-rabbit fursona. Her tiny pink nose at the end of her muzzle twitching furiously as Peter’s musk continues to invade her. Seeing Peter smile and placing a paw on her check and rubbing it softly; Helen squeals in delight as she feels him entering her folds. The barbed cock of his digging in and causing her body to shudder as she screams and moans in pure ecstasy. Every thrust, every lick from Peter’s tongue on her exposed nipples and twitching nose drove the were-rabbit to new heights of pleasure. Losing count to the many orgasms her body has currently had as Helen’s eyes glaze over in pure pleasure. She was so lost into the moment that Helen never realized that Peter pulled out only to flip her onto her stomach and take her from behind.<br />
<br />
For Helen the act of rutting with the large were-lion felt like it could go on all night. The fear of the large predator on top of her long since faded as Peter continued to thrust and grind Helen to her final mind numbing orgasm. All Helen could think of in a brief moment of clarity was “I found my mate and he is a were-lion.”<br />
<br />
Feeling the impending climax build within him; Peter starts to renew his thrusting into Helen’s sex. Bottoming out into her; Peter could feel the tip of his member kissing Helen’s cervix. Feeling the orifice within her brushing his glans; Peter roars as he feels his balls clenching and his body letting loose with his seed. Shooting his load into Helen, Who shouts and screams as loud as she can as her own body roils with its own release.<br />
<br />
Both growl and moan as their own fluids mingle and mix with each other; the large amount of seed Peter is spraying within Helen, leaking out of her despite her vaginal muscles clamping down and locking the feline member down. Both collapse on the bed still joined and still in a state of orgasmic bliss. Helen’s need sated for the moment as she murmurs happily as Peter manages to wrap his large muscular arms around Helen in a protective embrace. Their intense rutting being both physically and mentally draining as they quickly pass out from sheer exhaustion.</p>
