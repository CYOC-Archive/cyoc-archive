<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually his “brothers” had to leave, bidding him farewell as they cleaned themselves up and changed back into their clothing. Now alone in his room, Luke still had no idea on what was happening. Believing he should probably use his brain later and get changed first, he got up and felt his new belly jiggle to his sudden motion in standing up.<br />
<br />
Feeling disgusted, Luke took a look at his reflection in the mirror in his room. If Luke had seen this man, he would have just assumed it was one of Dad’s relatives. Most likely a younger brother or cousin. Knowing that the man reflected was in fact himself filled him with more dread that he would’ve like.<br />
<br />
Luke hadn’t been the most athletic kid before but he was on the track team so he was moderately fit. And he still looked somewhat young for an 18 year old having just the average amount of body hair on his body such as his arms, legs, armpits, etc. But the man in the mirror looked way too different from Luke even if he knew it was just supposed to resemble an older version of himself.<br />
<br />
First of all his face was like an exact duplicate of his Dad’s and Uncle’s. His dark brown hair had been pushed up a bit more that he would’ve like as his hairline had receded. He could also tell he was going slightly gray at his temples but only by a few strands of hair. His face looked more rugged and worn, the appearance of a formidable man. Luke could tell he had slight creases near his eyes but since he wasn’t too old, he didn’t have any wrinkles or anything he would expect from someone much older. Besides his new bushy brown beard hid most of his face anyway.<br />
<br />
As Luke stroked his beard, feeling a slight calming sensation, he decided next to examine the rest of his body. One thing he couldn’t miss was the hirsute nature of his body. There was so much hair everywhere it was kinda revolting. Luke resembled a bear or anything that was full of body hair anywhere he named it. Arms, legs, chest, ass, no place was devoid of hair. “Looks like I’ll take after Dad’s and Uncle John’s genes,” he thought as he combed the bushels of hair on his arms.<br />
<br />
Next was probably the worst part of the transformation. His body. More as in his physique. His pecs had turned into roundish chubby moobs and his stomach had expanded quite so to give him a bit of a gut. As expected the rest of his body proportionally matched his new body fat, consisting of flabby yet firm arms and legs which seemed to be powerful underneath all the fat surrounding them. He rubs his belly, feeling it jiggle along with his moobs. Although it was disturbing, Luke felt a bit comforted at the sensation almost as if he was used to being this heavy and big. Luke shivered at the thought realizing he had almost felt more comfortable in his new form rather than his actual body.<br />
<br />
Besides that, his body was more or less what he expected. He could see his bushy set of brown pubes and mammoth dick hanging down below with his enormous balls. He had plenty of experience getting to know that of course. His thighs and legs were the same: hairier, wider, and fatter. His back didn’t interest him much, but Luke could tell from his side reflection that his ass stuck out quite a bit now that it was so big and chunky from his new weight gain. And yes…there was plenty and plenty of hair on it.<br />
<br />
For the most part Luke felt energized but he could tell his body had born worn down a bit. As a man of 35, he didn’t have as much stamina as he would’ve previously. He could tell that some parts of his body felt a bit more exhausted and worn out as he took notice of his calloused rough hands and placed them together. Luke stretched his arms in attempt to lower any discomfort and felt them nearly grasping the ceiling. Apparently he was a bit taller now, Luke could only guess this meant he would grow a few more inches after he was 18 and glanced around the room and finally took notice of it. It was empty.<br />
<br />
The whole room was devoid of anything except for the bed, dresser, and mirror. Where had all his belongings gone? Had they vanished along with his old self or what? Confused Luke made his way to the dresser to find the box of condoms inside the first drawer. Which was good he guessed? Considering they’re what got him into this mess in the first place. But he didn’t know how he could use them now, especially considering how Uncle John seemed to be affected by them into believing Luke was now his younger brother. Hopefully they could still provide his solution into turning back to normal. He took them out and placed them on top of the dresser so he would remember to do some more research about them later.<br />
<br />
Making a move on to the second drawer he found nothing along with the third final drawer. He grumbled before taking note of the suitcase peeking from the closet. He opened the door to find a large gray suitcase residing inside the barren closet and opened it to find new clothes that would fit his new form. Pulling out some briefs, some large pants, and a nice looking collared shirt, he laid them on the bed before turning his attention to his reflection.<br />
<br />
Yep. Still a hairy middle aged naked man. He put on the briefs and felt them tightly wrap around his larger ass comfortable as the cloth was accustomed to his wider and larger size. It also was able to support his new package quite nicely. Luke decided to move on or he felt that he would find himself jerking off again. He put on the pants which he assumed would be too large now fit perfectly if a little almost tight. Likewise, the collared shirt he wore felt somewhat tight and he could tell the fabric made his new rolls, gut, and moobs stick out a bit more than he would’ve liked.<br />
<br />
But it seemed he didn’t have much of a choice. Also all of his other shirts seemed to be similar so he doubt any of them would be any different. After putting on some ankle cut socks and impressive size 15 dress shoes, Luke felt dressed well enough to join his “brothers”. Now he just had to decide what to do.</p>
