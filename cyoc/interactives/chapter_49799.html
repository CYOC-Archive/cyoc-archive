<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And that one shall be called Northwest, and that one shall be called Northeast, that one <br />
shall be called Southwest, while you there shall be called Southeast. But you do not have <br />
names, and thus you would not have anyone for your names to be called or names to be, <br />
and what are you is grotesque statues to protect the pack. And you at the center I suppose <br />
should be called Frontdoor, while the last I am told we would have shall be called <br />
Backdoor.&quot;  They were wonderfully monstrous, like an entire babble of Bandersnatch.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress Alice get down from there this instant!&quot; Called one of Martha's heads the other <br />
still looking through the book with the seven year olds of Alice's namesake. <br />
<br />
Alice was on top of one of the higher book shelves looking out a window seeing the <br />
gargoyles take up their positions around the house and then not moving a stone muscle or <br />
so much as breathing: making for all the world appear that they were but carved stone and <br />
nothing more.  Alice knew the gargoyles couldn't hear her, but she didn't mind, she'd tell <br />
them what she had named them later once they were out and about, after all, Alice hadn't <br />
gone outside since she was born and she curious about seeing it through her glass eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is alright Miss Martha!&quot; Alice curtsied downward, &quot;I am indestructible. A fall means me <br />
no harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The left head frowned, &quot;But your brothers and sisters aren't, I don't want you to encourage <br />
such reckless behavior and what if you fall and hit one of them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice got a surprised look on her face, &quot;I shall admit, I did not think about such things.&quot;<br />
<br />
The left head spoke in a no non-sense tone, &quot;Clearly you didn't: now get down now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice felt like asking which 'now' she should have tried for, but did not want to upset her <br />
nanny anymore than she already had and the glass wolf child climbed down the book <br />
shelves carefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't even think it.&quot; Martha's right head said to the seven year olds holding her their tails <br />
with her lower arms from where they were sitting her lap. <br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy then tried very hard not to think of  climbing up the book cases to the <br />
very predictable opposite effect. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do hope mother finishes with helping the last of the servants become part of our pack <br />
with auntie before brillig, I have not had a chance to converse with her properly since I <br />
was born!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mother?&quot; Kevin asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wish to read or talk?&quot; Martha's right head asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can't I do both?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now.&quot; Martha said plainly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot; Kevin went back to his book. <br />
<br />
Bart looked at Kevin, if his little brother was to be a boy, he was going to have to teach to <br />
boy up on a few things otherwise Bart would be cornered by three girls and one traitor to <br />
boys everywhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nana,&quot; Bart asked, &quot;Can we go outside and play once all the servants are changed?&quot; <br />
<br />
Matha's left head looked at Bart and closed her top eye and nodded, &quot;Yes Master Bart, you <br />
and your siblings may, but you're to stick to the backyard understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Nana.&quot; Bart nodded to the silver Pack Omega. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You were supposed to include the erasure of the memory of them from those who knew <br />
them besides the pack remember?&quot; Fran pointed out calmly and not with the least bit of <br />
malice towards Jack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right... oops.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well... it's not like anyone will recognize them, and the messages they gave their <br />
families should hold things off. However, that'll make six people who have made calls like <br />
that in the last forty-eight hours, not counting myself and Darla. Marcine better remember <br />
to include it for the pack members we'll be creating from the remaining staff... Otherwise <br />
that cover story might go past critical mass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sorry.&quot; Said the twenty-one hours to go human. <br />
<br />
The gargoyle said nothing, merely staying where it was as frozen in place as any mass of <br />
stone. <br />
<br />
Fran put a paw on Jack's shoulder.  &quot;Well it's done and done and can't be undone and for <br />
now nothing more to be done about it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome.&quot; Fran nodded. Fran had the powerful urge to seek out her twin, but fought off <br />
the gut instinct until such time as she could be sure the conversion process was underway <br />
for the remaining staff members.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
The perverted man whose brother would soon be a female gargoyle/grotesque Backdoor,  <br />
had followed Darla like a bee to honey. The young maid with the small ribbon in her hair <br />
followed behind like wrath on a sinner. The Useful Man and The Butler, along with several <br />
other members of the staff followed behind at a safe distance. <br />
<br />
The perverted man who drooled at Darla followed her through with the speed of lust. <br />
Darla was genuinely impressed, while she was going slow so the humans could follow her <br />
trail, she was surprised that any human could hope to match her speed. <br />
<br />
And the maid with the small ribbon in her hair was following close behind too and not by <br />
a wide margin. One would have to wonder why she'd be so agitated over this man in <br />
particular going after a naked animal woman. <br />
<br />
Darla found Marcine waiting patiently and calmly just like she was supposed to be and <br />
smiled at the wolf with her big doe eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha now sexy!&quot; Said the perverted man behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I'm actually taken.&quot; Darla said did a back flip that landed her right behind the <br />
perverted man.  However she was then mowed down by the maid with the small ribbon in <br />
her hair who didn't even stop for the she-wolf, Darla's breasts squishing against the cold <br />
floor. And idle thoughts occurred to Darla at this in light of the weirdness of the situation <br />
and the maid with the little ribbon in her hair walked over her.  'Should we kept the <br />
carpets? They retain oder, but it's not like none of us dislike it, but then there's there our <br />
claws, we can't pull them back in so we'd always be making noise on the floor without <br />
them, but they can get caught in the rugs too... hmm.. this is gonna require so thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got you Nicolas!&quot; The maid with the small ribbon not sounding happy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down Nicole! I just wanted to see what the deal was with her!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the 'something for nothing' deal she threw at you feet?&quot; She put her hands on <br />
her hips not realizes she was standing on the she wolf.<br />
<br />
Nicolas waved his hands, &quot;Now now, don't be like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what precisely?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I er, that is, I mean, don't be so upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm agitated! You don't want to see me upset!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Butler, and the Useful Man, heading the pack of the remainder of the staff, were <br />
shocked and surprised to see Nicole on top of the dirty blond throw rug. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Nicole,&quot; Said the Useful Man.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Said the maid sternly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Er,&quot; The Useful Man pointed, &quot;Look below.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole glanced down and saw the she-wolf, &quot;Oh...&quot; She said calmly and took a step off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, but I have a question I need to ask all of you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wait Marcine!&quot; Nicole shot back. <br />
<br />
Darla got back up, &quot;Now, I really do think you should-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wait too!&quot; Nicole gave Darla a upper cut out of nowhere that floor the seven foot <br />
tall muscle built she-wolf who could have torn Nicole in two in Darla's sleep. <br />
<br />
'Who is this girl? Xena?' Darla thought to her favorite show. Though now she was thinking <br />
Hercules might be more fun to watch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole that is enough!&quot; The Butler said, &quot;Nicolas' immaturity can wait! I think we should <br />
find out what this lady meant by Mr. and Mrs. Smith granting her and her double <br />
permission to be on the grounds, and if they do have permission, you WILL NOT HARM <br />
ONE OF THE MASTERS' GUESTS!&quot; <br />
<br />
The man was twice Nicole's age at least, but had his hair tied back into a pony tail. <br />
<br />
Nicole took a step back from the older man, crossed her arms, and gave a huff. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you are a guest of the Masters I do apologize for Nicolas' immaturity and Nicole's <br />
temper.&quot; The Butler helped Darla up as best he could, he was surprising strong, much like <br />
Nicole. <br />
<br />
Nicole said nothing while Nicolas looked embarrassed. <br />
<br />
Darla felt a twang of humiliation too, 'Please don't let my sister or Master find out about <br />
this.' <br />
<br />
 &quot;I'm not technically a guest,&quot; Darla said, &quot;You could say I'm a new resident, and the Master <br />
actually has several pieces of reorganization that he wishes to undertake in the light of the <br />
addition of me and my sister among others.&quot; <br />
<br />
Of course Darla meant Jensen, while the Butler meant Bartholomew. The level of loyalty <br />
both felt was surprisingly similar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? What kind of changes? I thought the Master would inform me first.&quot; Said The Butler. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all rather quite sudden actually.&quot; Darla said. It was a tiny bit overwhelming how none <br />
of these humans thought her naked and animal state was something to question her <br />
about. And she doubted they were all taking the 'costume' excuse like she and Fran had as <br />
Frank and Daryl. &quot;And Marcine had been instructed to ask you all some private questions <br />
five at a time about your opinion about some of the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What questions?&quot; the Butler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's to be asked in private five at a time,&quot; Darla repeated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. But I will see the Master at once after this!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;As you wish.&quot; Darla bowed suppressing a grin. &quot;But five at a time please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You there boy you come in.&quot; The Butler pointed at a random man servant who meekly <br />
entered the room. He then looked at Darla, &quot;And you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Darla growled slightly, the Butler didn't faultier. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said in private didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla growled again and bowed her head and walked outside to keep the remaining staff <br />
members company and to keep them distracted from any flying rock monsters that <br />
happened to fly out o the other end of the house with her two most noticeable talents. <br />
<br />
The door closed behind them Marcine finally had her chance, and the group finally looked <br />
at her and noticed her hair now look strangely short and was the same brownish gold <br />
almost as Young Simba from the Lion King. And her eyes... something REALLY was right <br />
about them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now the question is very simple. Transform or Dare? To each of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Say what now?&quot; Nicole said, &quot;Mr. Smith got his hands on THAT GAME?&quot; Nicole had actually <br />
heard of the game, and had once seen it used by two body builders at the gym who had <br />
basically destroyed each other by Transforming and Daring each other back and forth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or what now?&quot; Nicolas asked being native to Glendale but also being very <br />
ignorant of local culture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; The Useful Man said never having seen the curse in action and all his <br />
knowledge hearsay, much like his UFO and Atlantis conspiracy collection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my.&quot; Said the Butler feeling insulted, &quot;If Mr. Smith wanted to use the Game to benefit <br />
the estate he doesn't need to be so absurd about it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... what do you mean?&quot; Said the man servant who while native, his parents had made <br />
sure he had never heard of such 'absurdities'  while growing into a man. <br />
<br />
Nicole cursed and berated herself for falling into such a trap. And knew there was no way <br />
out. It strangely never occurred to her to simply punch Marcine's lights out.  &quot;Tranform! <br />
F8CKING transform!! I'd rather be a carnival sideshow freak than some mindless sex doll <br />
or zombie slave!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot; The Butler said with a stiff of the lip with his arms behind his back, his sense <br />
of loyalty feeling tarnished but still strong. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform?&quot; The man servant said not really sure what was going on but following the <br />
trend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare!&quot; Said the Useful Man, figuring whatever warped task Mr. Smith had in mind couldn't <br />
be as bad as being turned into something weird. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh? Transform too?&quot; Said Nicolas mostly cause Nicole did hoping it impressed her. <br />
<br />
Marcine didn't miss a beat and said, to the Useful Man, &quot;I Dare you to answer transform <br />
next time someone asks you Transform or Dare and to tell me to ask you Transform or <br />
Dare after I've transformed the others.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S CHEATING!&quot; Nicole snarls. <br />
<br />
Marcine shrugged. &quot;It's not my fault whoever made up this curse left it full of loopholes. <br />
And as for your four's transformation.&quot; She pulled out some straws out of her pocket, <br />
&quot;Draw a straw, short straw will become a male Big Bad Wolf who shall service the females <br />
of the Big Bad Wolf pack who need release but either aren't worthy of THE Big Bad Wolf <br />
himself Jensen, or when THE Big Bad Wolf himself Jensen is simply too busy, you will be <br />
loyal to THE Big Bad Wolf and will relish your position and any other task the rest of the <br />
pack asks of you and only use your turn to expand the pack. I'll then get into the <br />
transformation of the rest of you. Oh and if you DON'T pull a straw, you'll instead turn into <br />
a solid gold statue of a naked japanese girl with breasts twice the size of beach balls that <br />
no one will ever remember sans the pack as anything BUT a statue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole, Nicolas, The Butler and the man servant all looked at each other and quickly drew <br />
straws. <br />
<br />
Marcine nodded at the person who had drawn the short straw.  &quot;As for the rest of you, you <br />
shall all become Big Bad She-Wolves, none of you may have breasts larger than the Alpha <br />
Female.&quot; This had been slipped in of course by Kaylee. All this meant was when and if <br />
Jennifer's high school friends were added to the pack, that they would be given <br />
PARTICULAR detail to each of their transformations as personally outlined and overseen by <br />
Jensen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; One of the victims groaned at what they assumed was Mrs. Smith's vanity. <br />
<br />
&quot;None of your friends or family who are not the pack shall remember you ever existed <br />
unless you attempt to make contact with them. Nor shall your records show you ever <br />
existed outside the estate.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Butlers' fists shook. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch.&quot; Nicole said with an icy voice. <br />
<br />
Marcine didn't stop smiling or staring with her doe eyes, &quot;You will continue your jobs at <br />
the mansion such as they will be after the house and estate are fully refurbished for the <br />
pack or will be given new tasks if your old job is defunct. You will -love- the master, you <br />
will be -loyal- to him, and -devoted- to him, and have no desire to be human again and <br />
shall put his sake and the sake of the pack above all other things. You shall not kill each <br />
other over the master's affection. You will love your destiny as part of the Big Bad Wolf <br />
Pack. You shall be relatively petit but still mighty she-wolves! The vast majority of you <br />
shall also be uniquely color coded. You will use your turn only to benefit the pack or your <br />
master...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
the door the servant's foyer opened a minute or so later. &quot;Come in next group.&quot; Said a <br />
female voice from within.<br />
<br />
This cycle repeatedly multiple times. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
An hour and a half later to two and a half hours or three later in the back yard, Kaylee <br />
marched in front of a map hanging on a peg board showing the estate with a black wolf's <br />
head hastily painted over it. <br />
<br />
Kaylee was her normal naked self, but had on a marine's helmet with two hole cut for her <br />
ears (the helmet had belonged to Mr. Smith's original father, but Bart would have cut the <br />
holes to make them fit his head all the same anyway). She also clutched in both hands an <br />
officer's swagger stick behind her back.  She marched in front of the map and turned to <br />
face those in front of her. <br />
<br />
In the backyard, were now a very large number of she-wolves and one impressively <br />
endowed male at the very back of the group. They were lined up rank and file, naked (one <br />
or two may or may not had a bit of personal decoration), with their feet together, their <br />
arms at their sides their muzzles foreword and a smile on all their faces. (Though the male  <br />
at the back with a smirk on his face did begin fondling the breasts of the somewhat taller <br />
female wolf in front of him and not to her objection). <br />
<br />
There was now anywhere from twelve, to fifteen to twenty five new she wolves in front of <br />
Kaylee (she hadn't bothered to count them yet). <br />
<br />
All them had breasts that were anywhere from A Cup to small C Cup. All of them also <br />
stood anywhere from six feet tall and one inch to six feet tall and eleven inches. All of <br />
them including the male were 'balled' in the sense of not having human hair on top of <br />
their heads. <br />
<br />
The male had dark gray fur and was six feet and one inches.  And their fur, whao, their fur. <br />
There was one she-wolf who had blue fur. There was one who had bright green fur. One <br />
was violet colored fur covering her. Purple. Magenta. Another even had PINK fur! And to <br />
balance them all out one had pearl colored fur. The biologically impossible fur colors went <br />
on and on! Basically any color that was not a natural color a wolf or a human being would <br />
have and was likely to see on the latest anime out of Japan. Pretty much none of them felt <br />
silly, and the few that did felt silly in a GOOD way. <br />
<br />
Kaylee barked like a general at their army, or just a very very large ham on stage, &quot;Now! <br />
Who do you serve? Who do you obey? Who do you -love-?!&quot; <br />
<br />
They all spoke together their smiles not faltering (though the female the pack had slight <br />
trouble answering with the male giving her plenty of pleasant distraction). &quot;We serve the <br />
pack! We obey our Alphas! We love Master Jensen The Big Bad Wolf!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is your purpose in life and creeds-!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To service and please Master in all things, to protect Master and the pack from all that <br />
would threaten us and him! To insure the estate remains a safe haven for the pack forever <br />
and always! To dream of a Glendale where all wear wolf ears even if it remains but a <br />
dream! And to never ever form labor unions!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right turn!&quot; <br />
<br />
All the she wolves obeyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;About face!&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned one-eighty degrees. <br />
<br />
&quot;Left turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
And now all of them had their rears and tails facing her. Which meant she saw the male <br />
exploring the she-wolf in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You! Get in line!&quot; Kaylee barked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha female!&quot; The male obeyed at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;About face!&quot; <br />
<br />
They were all facing her again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bow!&quot;<br />
<br />
They did so still smiling, happy to be of service. <br />
<br />
&quot;What theatric!&quot; Bart moaned sipping on a soda through a straw sitting on the grass cross <br />
eagle style a few feel behind and to the side of the pegboard but with a clear view of the <br />
new she wolves. <br />
<br />
&quot;He-at-tick-what?&quot; Marcy asked turning her head from her lemonade. <br />
<br />
Jenny explained sipping on a soda of her own, &quot;The theater sis'. Alpha Female is acting like <br />
she's in a play.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's cool!&quot; Kevin declared chomping on an ice-cream. <br />
<br />
&quot;You would.&quot; Said Marcy and Jenny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Kevin blinked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it Master Kevin.&quot; Martha said standing next to the pegboard one head <br />
facing towards the she-wolves and the other at her charges. One set of arms behind her <br />
back while the others folded in front in a V shape and her tails going straight down like a <br />
proper Omega. <br />
<br />
Kaylee made a sweep with the leather swagger stick and said, &quot;Now! We've got a lot of <br />
work to make the house presentable to master and comfortable for the pack! Receive your <br />
individual labor instructions from Beta Females Fran and Darla and let's get to it!&quot; Of <br />
course Kaylee would have the greatest task of all... supervising. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female!&quot; The she wolves all declared and began to break rank and chat excited <br />
along themselves about the scope of the project they were undertaking as they made their <br />
way to pick up a slip of paper with their particular spot in the house and particular task <br />
for removing the inside doors and expanding the size of the door frames and the <br />
removing of furniture that couldn't hold their weight and would simply be uncomfortable <br />
to their tails among other things.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if we'll be able to recognize the place once we're done!&quot; Said one she-wolf to <br />
another who happened to be next to her smiling.<br />
<br />
The other she wolf smiled back, &quot;Hey! I barely recognize me but I know that it's gonna be <br />
new and improved too!&quot;</p>
