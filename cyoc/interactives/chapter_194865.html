<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I used he as a pronoun since Arianne was a functional male already</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The process was a lot harder than Doctor Grugger has expected. He never realized how resistant the human mind is. There was no issue with the transplant of sex organs. Arianne&#39;s body had accepted Ruben&#39;s former penis and testicles as if it has always been there. Considering that Arianne was still developing, along with the influx of hormones rushing to his body, the doctor also noted a noticeable growth in the size of the transplanted penis. Originally, Ruben&#39;s penis was nothing to brag about. It was only four inches in length when flaccid and five inches when it&#39;s erect. When it was transplanted to Arianne&#39;s body, the combination of hormones has nearly increased the penis size two fold. It was now six inches flaccid, and nearly eight inches when it&#39;s erect. <br />
<br />
This was an unusual discovery by the doctor. It seems like when there&#39;s no organ rejection, the body fosters the transplanted organs a lot better than he thought. The idea that Arianne was cultivating and developing his father&#39;s former dick much better than Ruben did was driving the doctor&#39;s brain in ecstasy. Arianne was clearly meant to be a man, he just doesn&#39;t know it yet. <br />
<br />
The beginning stages of the healing process were the hardest. Arianne could not stop screaming whenever he sees the doctor to a point that the doctor decided to gag him for the first few weeks. The subliminals didn&#39;t seem to work at the beginning, but progress was seen much later, especially when stimuli is applied to the penis. The bandages were fully taken off after three weeks and the doctor was astounded to see how natural it reacted. Whenever the doctor touched the transplanted penis, it slowly started to get hard. All the sensory receptors in the penis are fully functional, and this pleased the doctor immensely. <br />
<br />
As a part of the doctor&#39;s &quot;mental rehabilitation&quot; to Arianne, he decided to play some subliminals while flashing photos of women while caressing Arianne&#39;s dick. This process was repeated over and over until Arianne&#39;s new sexual identity was solidified. It took two months before this happened but now, even without caressing Arianne&#39;s dick, his penis gets hard whenever photos of women are being shown to him. <br />
<br />
On the fifth month, the doctor decided that it&#39;s time to build up on the new man&#39;s body. Physically Arianne was on his way there. The doctor didn&#39;t strap him on the metal bed this entire time. After the transplanted penis has already healed up, the doctor provided exercise equipment for Arianne. Electrodes were installed all over Arianne&#39;s body in order to avoid him from escaping and also to force him to do the doctor&#39;s bidding. The doctor forced him to do a lot of cardio exercises for the first five months. This, along with the hormone supplements, caused the former woman&#39;s body to lose all of its curves. It now looks like a body belonging to a man in his early 20s. But this wasn&#39;t enough for the doctor. <br />
<br />
He wanted to replicate Ruben&#39;s former body to Arianne&#39;s as much as he could. Ruben&#39;s body was a bit on the stocky side. He wasn&#39;t fat by any means, but he had bulky muscles mixed with some middle aged fats. That&#39;s why he decided to start injecting Arianne with steroids every day. The doctor also increased the amount of food that he provided Arianne. Little did Arianne know that the food that he was being provided with contained appetite stimulants. This caused Arianne&#39;s body to swell up. Around this time, the doctor also prohibited cardio exercises and instead focused on muscle training. <br />
<br />
The results of this process was stellar. The combination of appetite stimulants, hormones, and steroids caused Arianne&#39;s body to bulk up and develop into a body similar to his father&#39;s. The introduction of steroids also aged him a bit, and by the seventh month he could easily pass as a hairy construction worker in his mid 30s...when in reality this was a former 18 year old girl that was heavily modified. <br />
<br />
No mirrors were shown to Arianne after the first time he was shown his reflection when he was still covered in bandages. He didn&#39;t know what he looked like, and Arianne didn&#39;t really think much about it. The subliminals along with the numerous electrodes stuck in his body caused him to be docile in following the doctor&#39;s orders. Deep inside, the mind of an 18 year old girl is still in there, but the physical and mental alterations that the doctor did have effectively locked any opposing thoughts. <br />
<br />
By the eight month of his experiment, the doctor decided that the time is coming close for Arianne to reintegrate to society. He wont be known as Arianne, the 18 year old school girl anymore. A new man is birthed in her place. The doctor fixed all the paperwork, and the new documents for a man named &quot;Arnold&quot; were prepared. The documents indicated that Arnold is a 36 year old man who is an estranged brother to Ruben. Arnold does not have any formal education since the doctor plans to use integrate him to society as a construction worker. <br />
<br />
Once he has prepared all of this, the doctor decided that now is the time to test how his favorite patient will respond to the outside world. With the electrodes still covering his body underneath his clothes, there is no way that Arnold can escape the doctor. He decided to take out Arnold out for a walk in their new neighborhood.</p>
