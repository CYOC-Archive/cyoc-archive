<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All three of your appearances changed the instant Ace tapped the Random button on the virtual mirror. You felt another round of static wash over your senses as the VR headset shifted your mind into a new set of inputs. The sensation passed as quickly as it had arrived however. Only this time your feet still felt like they were asleep.<br />
<br />
You glanced down reflexively. Even the simple act of moving your head down felt a bit unusual. It was heavier than it should have been. Your button down shirt and slacks were still on your body, but they looked a bit… bigger? The proportions of the room suddenly felt a bit smaller.<br />
<br />
More pressing however were your feet. You expected to see your shoes poking out from the bottom of your slacks. Instead you saw two large glossy black mounds.<br />
<br />
You lifted one of them up curiously. Your foot was just… <i>gone</i>. In its place you saw a massive black hoof.<br />
<br />
“Moo! Ace, what did you just do!?” Kris bellowed.<br />
<br />
You finally looked up at the mirror. It took a moment to process what you were seeing. There was a huge monster standing in the mirror. The furry beast had a bull’s head, a startled swishing tail, and it was miming your reaction as you put down your hoof.<br />
<br />
It was also wearing your shirt.<br />
<br />
Staring back at you was a massive dull-eyed minotaur! Beside you were two more minotaurs dressed like Ace and Kris. The three of you were so large you hardly fit in front of the frame.<br />
<br />
“Moo…!” You had meant to say some bland statement of awe, but you instead just let out an eager grunt.<br />
<br />
You reached up to touch the mirror. This was so surreal. You <i>felt</i> like the minotaur being reflected back at you. You realized you only had three large crude fingers now before they raised up into your vision to touch the glass. Your hands were furry, and each new digit ended in shiny black hoof caps.<br />
<br />
Your head was massive. You suddenly understood where all the weight had come from. It looked like someone had just unceremoniously stuck a brown-furred bull’s head on your shoulders. The fur traveled down your neck and who knew how far underneath your shirt.<br />
<br />
Wait, you knew how far. You could feel the fur frame your shoulders, and then generally taper off leaving your chest relatively unchanged. Your shirt was blocking blocking the view, but you knew right where every strand of fur on your body was. They covered your legs underneath your slacks and… you had the strangest sensation you had just gotten your hair cut. Your fur trimmed? Was this VR headset advanced enough to make you feel like your fur was the right length?<br />
<br />
“I didn’t realize it would randomize everyone standing in front of the mirror!” Ace moo’d back. Everyone’s voice seemed an octave lower.<br />
<br />
“We look like a couple of DnD rejects!” Kris laughed.<br />
<br />
You were only half paying attention to their banter. You rubbed the fur on your forearm a bit more. It felt like the right length. But it also just felt… right? All of this felt really nice.<br />
<br />
“Is there an undo button?” Kris chuckled, turning in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Ace nodded his muzzle, “Yeah, one sec.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes went a little wide. “Uh- Hang on.“ You clopped out from in front of the mirror. Woah, these things were a little odd to walk on…! <br />
<br />
The two watched you scurry away. They stared up at you as you continued to explore your body.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh,” you stuttered, “I think I’m going to look this over a bit more. You do can change back.”<br />
<br />
Ace tapped the undo button and immediately shifted back into his dog-tailed form from moments prior. Kris meanwhile just shifted back to their normal self.<br />
<br />
You meanwhile seemed outside of the mirror’s range. You were still a big bovine beast.<br />
<br />
You couldn’t get over how nice this all felt. You clopped over to a free mirror and gave yourself another once over. You couldn’t put your hoof on it. There was the increased height. There was the larger body mass. There were the hooves. There was the bull head. What was it that resonated with you so much?<br />
<br />
You hadn’t been a huge fantasy person. This wasn’t some untapped desire come to life. All the same, you couldn’t take your eyes off the mirror. You unbuttoned your shirt slowly, draping it over the side of the frame.<br />
<br />
Was it the fact that you looked like a beast? There was a certain amount of incivility to you. It was… the eyes maybe? Two big black bull eyes were staring into the mirror. They seemed to lack any depth to them. They were missing that spark that human eyes seemed to.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was your legs? The whole not-feeling-your-feet thing was growing on you. You reached down to tug on your pants, but remembered your coworkers were in the virtual room with you. Instead you awkwardly poked through the mirror’s interface. You found the section for clothing options and changed your slacks into a pair of gym shorts.<br />
<br />
Moo! Just like you thought! Your legs were covered in fur! Oh moo, this was… this was perfect. You turned in place and- Tail! You had a tail! It swished back and forth eagerly as you turned in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
A gentle cough filled the air. Your long ears perked as Ace and Kris walked over.<br />
<br />
“Ready to go?” Ace stood and looked at you.<br />
<br />
“Moo! Uh- Sorry. This tech’s just really good.” You gave them a big bull grin.<br />
<br />
Ace had apparently given himself dog paws in your absence. Meanwhile Kris was sporting a fetching pair of devil horns.<br />
<br />
“We were just about to log out. Our lunch break’s almost over,” Kris looked you and your shorts over.<br />
<br />
“Find something you like?” Ace teased, “Come on, we don’t want to be late for our staff meeting.”<br />
<br />
He reached up and mimed taking a VR headset off. Suddenly he vanished from the fake room you were in.<br />
<br />
“Good to know logging out isn’t hard,” Kris smiled and did the same.<br />
<br />
You stood there alone for a minute in the room. With the two gone, you curiously took a peek underneath your shorts. Oh wow, bulls had other advantages too.<br />
<br />
It was finally time to go. You reached up to pull on the helmet. You couldn’t help but give your horns a quick examination though. They were nice big longhorns, and were fun to run your fingers along. You didn’t want to keep everyone waiting though. With a quick tug at your scalp, the VR headset easily came off.<br />
<br />
You were in a bit of stupor after that. The clerk handed you some business cards and fliers about the gene modding process. You all piled back into your car and headed back to the office. The entire time you just kept patting yourself down. You were human again. It should have been comforting to be back in your usual form. Instead you couldn’t stop thinking about where your toes were doing as you walked. They seemed so weird now. You needed to get back in those hooves.<br />
<br />
You glanced around your cubical. When no one was watching, you fired up the New You website. They had plenty of appointments available. You scanned their openings for the week and selected one for right after work. There was no time like the present after all.</p>
