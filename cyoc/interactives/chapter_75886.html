<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…One of the drunk guys reached forward and grabbed Rose, who had returned to their table, by the breast.  <br />
Instantly two muscle-bound bouncers descended upon the table and forcibly pulled the two drunks up from their <br />
table.  The bouncers dragged the guys away from their table and actually right past our table.  It appeared <br />
that the bouncers were going to eject them via a side entrance.  That made some sense to me.  A trendy place <br />
like this wouldn’t want to throw people out the front door in full view of a line of people.<br />
<br />
“I guess Rose warned someone about those guys,” I said to Colette.<br />
<br />
Colette looked angry.  She really didn’t like what she witnessed.  “Chris, I want to go,” she said.  “I want <br />
to go now.  Right now.”  Her voice was as impatient as could be.<br />
<br />
“Let me pay the check,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Use the ring and wish for it,” she said with even more impatience.  I did as she asked and wished that our <br />
bill was paid.  “Let’s go,” she said with a commanding, rather than a suggesting tone.  <br />
<br />
As we headed for the door, we saw Rose again.  “Thanks for coming, hope to see you again,” she said.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure we will,” said Colette as she managed to smile back at Rose.  She remarked to me, “We will sometime <br />
soon.”<br />
<br />
We got out of the club and saw that the long line was still there.  I followed after Colette who walked away <br />
from the club at a brisk pace.  “Hey,” I called to her.  She didn’t stop or turn to look at me.  “Hey!” I said <br />
forcefully.  “Where are you going?”<br />
<br />
She stopped and turned around.  “I want blood,” she said.  She had her fangs out and ready.  <br />
<br />
“Put those away!” I said.  “Someone could see you.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” she said.  Her fangs retracted.  “I want to get those two assholes!”<br />
<br />
“Look, calm down a little,” I said.  “We don’t know where they are—“<br />
<br />
“That’s what the ring is for!” she practically shouted.  <br />
<br />
I was a little upset with her brusqueness.  I crossed my arms and looked at her disapprovingly.  “Just what <br />
exactly is in your mind?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I want to make those two idiots pay,” she said.<br />
<br />
“How?” I demanded.<br />
<br />
“With their blood, of course,” she snapped back.<br />
<br />
“That’s not what I meant.  Do you intend to kill them or just have a little taste?” I clarified my original <br />
question.<br />
<br />
The look of determination on her face cracked.  She understood what I meant.  “I…I don’t know for sure,” she <br />
said.<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” I said.  “You just let yourself lose control.  You can’t do that.”<br />
<br />
Now she folded her arms.  “Why is that exactly?” she asked.  “We’re vampires and you’ve made all these <br />
conditions, so how are we in danger?  Especially when you have the ring!”<br />
<br />
“There’s always the unexpected,” I said.  “Things can go too fast.  And I hate to say this, but there’s <br />
probably something I’ve overlooked that could kill us!  I don’t know what, but something, maybe.  I’m not <br />
willing to take a risk like that.”  I uncrossed my arms.  She didn’t change her stance.  I walked over to her <br />
and wrapped my arms around her.  “I don’t like what they did, either, but what they did isn’t a good reason to <br />
kill them.  If you want to teach them a lesson, I’m cool with that,” I said.<br />
<br />
Finally she unwrapped her arms and returned my embrace.  “I’m sorry, Chris,” she said.  “You’re right.  I…I <br />
wasn’t thinking.  I did lose control.  I’m sorry.”  She gripped me tighter.  “But I can’t help but want to <br />
hurt those guys.”<br />
<br />
“Here’s what we’ll do…” I said.<br />
<br />
About ten minutes later we found ourselves waiting for our opportunity.  As our luck would have it, the two <br />
drunks had walked to the bar and so had to walk home.  We used the ring to wish we knew where they were and <br />
what their likely path would be.  They would have to walk past a very secluded area that was poorly lit.  It <br />
was an old industrial park that hadn’t been used in some time.  We could do what we wanted here without having <br />
to worry about detection.  We used the ring to wish ourselves to this location so that they would come to us.<br />
<br />
Another thing I took the precaution of wishing for was the knowledge if either of them were armed.  Just as I <br />
suspected, the second guy did indeed have a switchblade.  I had just the idea to take care of the likelihood <br />
of it being used.  Not that I really feared it, because I assumed my wishes would protect us from harm from a <br />
blade, but the end result would be highly amusing.  <br />
<br />
We awaited their arrival.  We could not see any other pedestrians or cars in this desolate area.  Soon the <br />
pair of drunks came stumbling toward our position.  Colette looked at me and said, “Here they are, get back.”<br />
<br />
“I still don’t like this idea,” I said.  Colette insisted this would be the best plan, but I didn’t like the <br />
thought of her as bait.<br />
<br />
“Just shut up and get back!” she said in a hushed tone.  “I’ll be fine.”  I crept back several feet into a <br />
shadowed position, behind what looked like a rusted fuel drum, from where I could not be seen.  The drunks <br />
reached our position.  They talked to each other, but I couldn’t understand them from where I was.  Their <br />
speech was predictably slurred and largely incoherent.  Colette slinked forward a bit in order to be seen.  <br />
“Hey there, boys!” she greeted them cheerfully.  “Interested in a little fun?”  She ran her hands over her <br />
breasts for added effect.<br />
<br />
“Are you for real?” one of the drunks said as best I could tell.<br />
<br />
Colette said, “Sure, just follow me.”  She turned and walked seductively closer to me.  She went past me a few <br />
feet.  I crouched down as far as I could and hoped that the drunks focused their limited attention on her.  I <br />
saw them stumble their way past me.  They chortled at each other for their seemingly unbelievable luck.  <br />
Colette stopped walking once she saw that they cleared my position.<br />
<br />
I crept quietly out of my hiding space and stood up straight.  “I’m afraid the fun will be all ours,” I said.  <br />
The drunks spun around and saw me.  I immediately bared my fangs and hissed at them.  They turned back to <br />
Colette and saw her do the same thing.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” said one of the drunks.  The other one reached into his pocket and pulled out his <br />
switchblade.  As soon as he opened it, it just vanished from his hand.  My wish for that to happen worked <br />
brilliantly.  He looked at his empty hand dumbfounded.  <br />
<br />
Before he could make another move, Colette was upon him and sank her fangs into his neck.  The other drunk <br />
panicked quite predictably and looked for somewhere to run.  In his disoriented state he couldn’t decided <br />
where to go.  He also didn’t stand a chance to avoid me thanks to my abilities.  I was on him quickly.  He <br />
tried to throw a punch which I ducked easily.  His wild attempt left him off balance which caused him to fall <br />
right into me.  I plunged my fangs into his neck and tasted blood again.<br />
<br />
I had made a wish that they would not die from our drinking, much as I had done with Colette.  As it turned <br />
out neither of us drank a lot from our victims.  There was a good reason for that.  “I can taste the alcohol <br />
in his blood,” Colette moaned.<br />
<br />
“So can I,” I said.  “I stopped because of it.”<br />
<br />
“Now we know not to target drunks,” she said.<br />
<br />
Our victims both passed out.  I think their drunkenness had as much to do with that as our actions.  Colette <br />
and I looked down at them like they were insects.  “Are you satisfied?” I asked her.<br />
<br />
She didn’t immediately answer.  “Somewhat,” was all she managed.  “Maybe revenge isn’t so sweet.”<br />
<br />
I decided not to encourage her.  “Maybe it isn’t,” I agreed.  That was actually a theory I still intended to <br />
test at some point.  There was that thing she still wouldn’t tell me.  A feeling inside me said that revenge <br />
would be a likely course of action once she did.<br />
<br />
We looked around and saw that our actions had not attracted any attention.  I wished that the bite marks on <br />
their necks would close up and there would be no trace of blood on them.  I also wished for the switchblade to <br />
return to the drunk who possessed it.  <br />
<br />
“Aren’t you going to wish them to forget this?” asked Colette.  That had been our original plan.<br />
<br />
“No,” I said.  “What’s the point?  There’s no evidence they were attacked by anyone.  They were drunk, so they <br />
might forget on their own.  But it’s not like they’ll go to the police and even if they did, who would believe <br />
them?”<br />
<br />
“They could identify us somehow, though,” she said.  “Or describe us to a sketch artist.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “Great point.  I wish that they wouldn’t remember what we looked like so any memories they <br />
retain will be useless.”  I looked at Colette and held out my arm.  “Let’s get out of here.”  She took my arm <br />
and we walked away without giving the two drunks even a second glance.</p>
