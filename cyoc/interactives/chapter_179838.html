<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">How long has it been since Giovanni last lived in an actual house, rather than that abandoned warehouse? How long has it been since he had a hot shower, slept in a warm bed (or, in this case, slept with someone in a warm bed), and had a decent meal? Has it been two, maybe three years at this point? Three years of begging and stealing, just to survive. It made him realize just how much he took everything for granted, back when he was young and naive. Well, at least he could give Ralph and Alejandro these things now with the Chronivac. To Gio, the fact that they managed to survive living like that for most of their lives in those conditions was nothing short of a miracle.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after having some &quot;fun&quot; with Antonio and showering, Giovanni was examining his new body in the mirror. And damn, what a body. Not only did he look sexy as all hell now, but he also appeared so powerful and commanding now. Every time he twisted and turned his body in the mirror, he ended up finding something else he liked about it. Round, wide shoulders that made him broad and intimidating. Bulky, powerful arms that were sure to both impress and scare. A broad back giving him that sexy V-shape. Large, round pecs filled with muscle and confidence. A thick core with abs that were meant to be strong and not just for show and long, tree trunk-like legs, supporting and enhancing his entire body. It was funny. Before, he didn&#39;t really care much about building muscle, but now that he had them, he loved having them. He was glad that the guys managed to talk him into doing this. Speaking of, a freshly out-of-the-shower Antonio had hugged Giovanni from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boss, you busy admiring yourself? Well, I can assure you that you look very sexy.&quot; Antonio&#39;s words tickled Gio&#39;s now muscular neck. The underling&#39;s hair was still slightly damp and smelled of shampoo, a smell neither of them was used to Antonio having.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am. Though, I didn&#39;t expect you to be the affectionate type, Tony.&quot; Not that Gio minded. This sort of intimacy he also didn&#39;t have in a long time. The boss had to admit he was learning a lot about Antonio from this experience than he thought he was. Gio knew that Antonio had a rough home life and ended up falling into the wrong crowd but not much else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..., uh, so... was the sex good for you as it was for me?&quot; Antonio blushed as he said that. For example, Gio was learning about his subordinate&#39;s bashful side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, it was the best sex I had. Although, whether that&#39;s because of our new physiques, the fact that I haven&#39;t had any in a while, or because it was with you is up for debate.&quot; What Gio said made Antonio smile. &quot;Anyway, as much I want to just enjoy each other&#39;s company, I need to get back to work. Revenge doesn&#39;t plan itself out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, boss, let me help you plan. I know not the smartest, but I&#39;m a good listener.&quot; At Antonio&#39;s request, Gio paused for a bit and shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I guess it wouldn&#39;t hurt. Now come on, get dressed, and we can start,&quot; Giovanni responded. However, as he reached for some clothes, his subordinate piped up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do we really need to wear shirts while we&#39;re here in our new home?&quot; This time, Antonio&#39;s request was met with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I guess we don&#39;t,&quot; Giovanni said as he took one more lustful look at Antonio&#39;s new body. Then both of them put on pants but no shirts and went back to Giovanni&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Back at the office, the boss pulled up three profiles on the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, so these are the three bastards that I know are responsible for taking away everything I work hard for. These are my former lawyer Hudson Miller, my former secretary Lisa Green, and my former business partner and co-founder of my startup Peyton Cooper.<br />
<br />
Antonio looked at the pictures that accompanied the profiles. The first one he looked at was Hudson&#39;s, the lawyer. Hudson was an older man, maybe in his mid-to-late 40s or even early 50s. His hair was almost entirely grey, and he a tired look to him. Next, he looked at Lisa, the secretary&#39;s profile, and she looked as he imagined her to look like. A mousy brown, plain jane. In fact, any more describing of her would just bore Antonio. Finally, there was Peyton, the current owner of Giovanni&#39;s startup. Wow, he was a nerd. With a scrawny body and somewhat homely face, he made Mark Zuckerberg look like a hunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the first step in my plan is to give them exactly what they want. Transform my targets into their ideal bodies.&quot; This plan had caused a confused look to appear on Antonio&#39;s face. Something that Giovanni anticipated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what? I thought you were looking for revenge? Why are you giving them their ideal bodies? Shouldn&#39;t you be making them suffer, or at least make them feel sorry?&quot; the underling asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, which is why when I arrive to take back what&#39;s mine, I&#39;ll take away everything, including the transformation I gave to them. That way, they can feel exactly how I did when they took everything from me.&quot; Gio&#39;s explanation was met with a nod of understanding and a grin of mischievousness from Antonio. &quot;So, for Hudson, I believe he wants to be young again. He was always talking about his glory days in the past, so he would probably be ecstatic to find himself becoming younger. As for Payton and Lisa, both of them would probably want to become more attractive. You&#39;ve seen their profile pictures, right? Not the most attractive people in the world. In fact, during one of our bar nights, I do recall them complaining about their looks too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, Giovanni couldn&#39;t wait to see the look on their face when he reverses the transformation and then takes back his company and everything rightfully his. The boss then typed up a draft of all the changes he would make. Hudson would regress to his mid-twenties, Lisa would resemble a supermodel, and Peyton would look like an action movie star. All of these changes would occur over the course of a week, and after that week was up, Gio and his gang would swoop in and take back everything. After making some tweaks, he showed the draft to Antonio.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think? Everything looks good?&quot; the boss asked. The underling took a look, his face remaining neutral while reading it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think it&#39;s... good,&quot; Antonio began, &quot;But, what about sexuality changes? I know your bisexual and all, so...&quot; Now it was Giovanni&#39;s turn to be confused. Was he implying that his sexuality was one of the reasons they got rid of him? Although now that he thought of it, there were times where they weren&#39;t as tolerant about his sexuality as they said they were. For example, one time, Hudson joked about Giovanni being a slut after learning about Giovanni&#39;s sexuality. He thought of it as a joke then, but now when he looked back on it, maybe it wasn&#39;t. Looking at everyone&#39;s profile, he noticed that all of them were all straight, hmmm.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a bad idea. You know Tony, you are definitely smarter than you say you are,&quot; Gio complimented, causing Antonio to blush a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, well, I learn from the best.&quot; After Antonio said that, Gio went back to his draft and added that his targets&#39; sexuality would gradually turn gay during the week. Hope they have fun playing for the other team, the boss thought. After that, the changes were finalized and were executed by the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, all I have to do now is figure out how to seamlessly take the company over. But, I week to figure that out. Now it&#39;s dinner time. Tell me, Tony, what do you want to eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, boss, I&#39;m fine with anything, as long as I have you as dessert...&quot;</p>
