<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke took the condom off his softening dick, wrapped it in a tissue, and set it aside to flush later. When he went to hide the condoms again he noticed a warning on the back. *Warning: This product is intended to be used with a partner. When used properly both of your pleasure will be increased. Misuse of this product can lead to undesired effects including a change in sex and age. You have been warned.*<br />
<br />
Luke just chuckled at the joke. There was no way that that his sex or age could be changed. He had to admit that the condom did increase his pleasure though. He hid the condoms and was just about to get dressed when he noticed that his dick was smaller than what it normally was. There was something that bothered him though, his balls weren't in his ball sack. As he watched his dick continued to shrink and it was thinning. He thought about the warning and realized that it was serious. His sex was changing from male to female.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Luke shouted as his dick became little more than a clit. &quot;THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!&quot;<br />
<br />
His parents must have heard him shout since they both came barging into his room. &quot;What's wrong son?&quot; his dad asked concern in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... I'm turning into a girl&quot; Luke said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ridiculous&quot; his dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't see his penis honey&quot; his mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have turtled on him&quot; his dad said. &quot;Probably the first time it's happened to him. If you don't know what it is it can seem like it disappeared. Well, welcome to the turtle club son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke calmed down a bit. His dad knew alot of things and that made sense. It made alot more sense than him turning into a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think it turtled honey&quot; his mom said. &quot;Look at him. His hair is growing longer right before our eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you're right about that&quot; his dad said. &quot;I don't have an explanation for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke felt a tickling on his neck which soon moved to his back. He reached a shaky hand up to the back of his neck and his hair had grown longer. &quot;THIS CAN'T BE!&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were convinced that you were turning into a girl before&quot; his dad said. &quot;Why were you so convinced?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because of the Christmas present Uncle John gave me&quot; Luke said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said he gave you a gift card&quot; his dad said with a puzzled look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I lied about that&quot; Luke said. &quot;He gave me a box of condoms.&quot; He went over to his dresser and took out the condoms. He handed them to his dad. As he did he noticed that he had shrunk a little bit. He was really starting to get scared now and the fact that his dad had a worried look on his face instead of his usual bashful look when he saw him without pants or underwear on was scaring him more.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has to be some sort of joke!&quot; his dad said after reading the warning out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do you explain what's happening to Luke?&quot; his mother asked. &quot;He's shrinking now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke had to keep looking up at his parents. Finally he was able to stop adjusting how far up he looked at his parents. It seemed that he had stopped shrinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel son?&quot; his dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird&quot; Luke said in a higher voice than he was used to. It was even higher than it had been when he was a kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what do we do now?&quot; his dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You go call John and see if he knows how to reverse this&quot; his mom said. &quot;I'll take Luke's measurements so we can get him some new clothes. He may be a girl for awhile and he can't go running around naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I DON'T WANT TO BE A GIRL!&quot; Luke shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you don't want to be a girl sweetie&quot; his mom said kneeling down and hugging him. &quot;But the fact remains that you are one for right now. You may be stuck this way until we can get ahold of Uncle John.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His note said that he didn't know what they did&quot; Luke said. &quot;If he doesn't know what they do then how can he know how to reverse it!&quot; Luke started to cry, something he hadn't done since he was thirteen. At least not over something stupid like this. Of course this hadn't happened to him before so maybe it was ok.<br />
<br />
His mom hugged him tighter and said &quot;It will be ok. We will find a way to fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you don't though!?!&quot; Luke wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think positive&quot; his mom said. &quot;But if we can't then you'll just have to grow up again though as a girl this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A GIRL!&quot; Luke wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know&quot; his mom whispered in his ear.</p>
