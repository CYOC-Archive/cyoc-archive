<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The Lovers?&quot;  Luke stared at the card, but dropped it once he noticed the faint glow.  It was probably too late though.<br />
<br />
Andrew rushed over, about to pick up the card but stopped himself.  He grabbed the only thing in range he could think of to pick up the card without touching it.  He ripped the towel right off of Luke, using it to pick up the card like some foul dead rat and throw it back on the table.  He turned on Luke, &quot;Idiot.  You&#39;ve been trapped on this island three months and you haven&#39;t learned not to mess with things?  That fortune teller uses her cards to change people.&quot;  Andrew looked down on the card.  As expected from the Lovers, it actually featured two figures.  A young red-headed man wrapped in a rather sexual embrace with a blurred figure that seemed to change appearance as you looked from different angles.  The image was so detailed Andrew&#39;s cock sprung almost right to attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three months?  Andrew?  You okay?  We&#39;ve only been here five days.&quot;  Luke sounded genuinely worried, even standing there with his hands over his now exposed cock trying to maintain some form of modestly, even with Andrew practically showing off his hirsute form.<br />
<br />
It was Andrew&#39;s turn to look confused.  &quot;Fuck.  This place must mess with everything.  Listen Luke, I&#39;m not Andrew..&quot;  He was cut off by Luke stumbling backwards a bit to take a seat on the end of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t feel so well..&quot;  Luke buried his face in his hands, exposing his cock which had since come to complete attention.  His body seemed to be practically vibrating, his muscles twitching under his skin.  As Andrew watched, they slowly expanded, each twitch of a muscle adding a little bit more to their swelling size.<br />
<br />
Andrew knelt down by Luke, placing a hand on his twitching leg.  A small jolt seemed to pass between them when their skin came in contact, but Andrew was so worried he didn&#39;t pay attention to it.  &quot;Listen, Luke.  It&#39;s the card.  It changes you.  It doesn&#39;t hurt but I don&#39;t think I can stop it.&quot;  Luke&#39;s skin was growing warmer under Andrew&#39;s hand, it felt like he was burning up.  He fell back completely on the bed, arms spread, back arched.  Andrew could only watch as more muscle swelled on Luke&#39;s previously lean frame.  Veins could be seen now snaking down his arms, his pectorals twin firm mounds on his chest.  His cock was growing, snaking slowly up his stomach, leaving a trail of glistening pre along Luke&#39;s firming abs.  At the base of his cock, his dark pubic hair was growing thicker, but also lighter in color, shifting from dark brown to a fiery red.  The hair on his arms and legs quickly followed in the change, becoming a bright red as it grew in thicker and curlier.<br />
<br />
The card on the table was glowing brighter and brighter, so much that when Andrew glanced at it, it appeared to be blank.  No.  It was blank.  The image had faded away.  A deep groan from Luke brought Andrew&#39;s attention right back to his transforming brother.  His skin paled only slightly, Luke had never had a dark complexion to begin with, but freckles began to dot his skin.  They appeared first along his cheeks and the bridge of his nose, as well as across his chest and shoulders.  They continued to spread along his fair skin till most of his skin was covered.  The sheets had bunched under him at his expanding body.  Whoever had been in the card was not only more muscular than Luke, but was taller as well.  Curly red hair continued to grow in a fine line up his stomach, a light dusting spreading across his chest, leaving his pecs with a coppery sheen.<br />
<br />
The hair on his head lightened from his normal brown, to a bright orange-red.  It stayed the same length but gained a slight curl to it that Luke&#39;s straight hair had completely lacked.  Luke&#39;s facial features were also disappearing, the face Andrew knew so well being overtaken by another.  Luke&#39;s finer features were becoming sharper and more rugged, almost lupine.  His lighter beard suddenly thickened, growing days worth of beard in mere seconds, a neatly trimmed red chinstrap beard quickly lined his jaw.  Luke&#39;s changes seemed to be slowing down, the male to male change a lot less drastic than Andrew&#39;s gender shifting.  Luke&#39;s brown eyes swirled into a stormy gray, his throbbing cock pushing out a bit more size as his red-furred sac sagged heavier between his legs.<br />
<br />
Andrew leaned over Luke&#39;s prone form, gently placing a hand on his shoulder, feeling that electric tingle once more, but gladly finding the skin with only normal warmth rather than the burning heat.  &quot;Luke.. you okay?&quot;  It felt strange to Andrew to call the masculine ginger laying on the bed Luke, but he knew from experience that despite appearances it was still Luke in there.  He hoped.<br />
<br />
Luke looked groggily up at Andrew, a dopey grin spreading across his face, almost mischievous.  &quot;I feel...&quot;  Luke placed a hand on the back of Andrew&#39;s head, fingers tangling his his dark hair.  He exercised his new muscles to pull Andrew&#39;s head down closer to his, and locked his lips with the swarthy jock.  At first Andrew pulled away, but the electric tingle coursed across their entangled lips, shivering down through his muscles and springing his cock to instant erection.  Andrew wanted to fight this..  It was wrong, he was making out with his own brother.  Then again, neither of them were in their own bodies.  Did it even count?  And it felt... so good.<br />
<br />
Andrew crawled up on the bed, straddling the prone Luke, finally breaking their tongue dancing kiss.  &quot;Luke.  I can&#39;t.. I&#39;m And..&quot;  He was cut off by another Luke initiated session of lip locking.  It his moment of shock, Andrew found himself knocked on his side, Luke&#39;s limbs tangling around him, his own arms and legs responding in kind.  Their bodies pressed up against each other, cocks rubbing together, trapped between their writhing forms.  Hairy chests and nipples brushing together.  Every little contact sent new feelings running through every nerve in their new bodies.  Mingled pre slid down their hot, hard shafts as their hips rocked in unison, eagerly rubbing their two manhoods together as their tongues played eagerly inside each others&#39; mouths.<br />
<br />
Luke broke away and pushed Andrew on his back, straddling him, knees tight against his muscular body.  Luke grasped Andrew&#39;s glistening shaft, directing it towards the entrance of his virgin hole.  Slowly, but eagerly, Luke lowered himself onto Andrew&#39;s shaft, causing the other man to begin moaning at the unfamiliar sensations.  He slid himself up and down the borrowed shaft, the female inside Andrew marveling at the new feeling of having a cock buried deep in a tight warm hole.  It was only a few short movements of Luke&#39;s hips before Andrew lets out a deep, reverberating moan, arching his back as he spills his new male seed for the second time, but for the first time inside another.  Luke lasts barely a few seconds longer, the hard shaft twitching inside him, flooding him with warm cum sends him over the edge.  His own cock christened by sending ropes of pearly cum across Andrew&#39;s dark chest hair.<br />
<br />
Luke collapses atop Andrew, unmindful of the cum now smeared across both their hairy chests.  &quot;I.. I don&#39;t know what came over me but that was..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So good.&quot;  Andrew finishes, right on top of Luke.  Slowly smiles spread across both their faces.<br />
<br />
At least until Luke pipes up with, &quot;What were you going to tell me before, I, ah... interrupted you.&quot;</p>
