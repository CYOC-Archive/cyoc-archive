<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">....his friend Mark. Memories of who Mark actually was began to fill Ty's mind. Suddenly he knows that Mark is in his biology class and that they often studied together to prepare for the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ty, it's Mark. You ready to get to studying?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither Ty nor Mark were very good at their school work and and their monthly meetings for review sections didn't seem to help a whole lot but it never the less allowed them time to catch up on some things that had been going on in their lives during college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I guess so. Come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mark entered the room Ty recognizes who he is right away. Thin and undefined, Mark wasn't all that much to look at, which obviously prevented him from getting much action with anyone, and to be honest it was hard to know if he actually even wanted any. He facial features seemed to be less than complimentary and the only really attractive thing about him was the brown hair on his head, smooth and perfect unlike most of his body. Today he came in ready to study in a plain white shirt and jeans with books in hand and ready to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mark,&quot; Ty said while siting in his desk chair. &quot;just put your books on the desk here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark walked over to Ty and put the books down on the desk. &quot;Wow, you sure have changed the decor of your room&quot; Mark takes a look at the posters on Ty's wall as he realises that he had just put up some of the posters this week and Mark hadn't seen them last time. Slightly embarrassed Ty remarks causally, &quot;yeah.&quot; Pointing at one of the posters on the wall, Mark chuckles and states, &quot;I bet that guy could get any girl he wanted,&quot; he sighs &quot;yeah I can only imagine the things I could do with a body like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark's remark gave Ty an interesting idea. At that moment he wished that Mark would freeze where he was, in suspended motion. After making the wish he stood up and shouted &quot;MARK!&quot; No answer, he knew his wish had worked right away. &quot;I always thought you wanted something more, now I have the perfect chance to help you, makes me wonder what you are going to do with your body and life afterwards.&quot; Still curious Ty makes another wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Mark would transform into the man in the poster on my wall, the one that he seemed to like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stood there staring at Mark and nothing happened. After a couple seconds Ty noticed movement under Mark's shirt; his muscles were growing. Not only that but his whole body was transforming into the guy from the poster. As his torso continued to expand Ty notices at how Mark's pecs are straining at the white shirt rubbing against the fabric putting intense pressure on the cheap material. Not only that, but his whole body was expanding, biceps ripping the sleeves of the shirt creating a slow ripping sound as Mark began to fill out in slow waves. Ty notices Mark's abs pushing out one by one forming small hills that began to push out into a perfect set of eight. The amount of muscle growth eventually just became too much for Mark's shirt as it exploded off revealing his perfectly rounded pecs and biceps that any man would be jealous of. Mark seriously looked like he was a total gym rat, like the guy from the poster. His face contorting into more of a square firm look with a trace of stubble snaking it's way across his chin and strong jaw. <br />
<br />
Ty, sitting down the whole time, now got up and walked over to Mark's motionless and transforming body. He took his hand and ran it down his chest feeling the waves of muscle that continued to build on Mark's expanding chest and arms, it felt and looked amazing. Ty couldn't help but notice the other changes that were happening on other parts of Mark's body, after all that poster wasn't on his wall for nothing. Mark's jeans were now straining at the growth that was going on in all portions of his lower body. In order to help Mark's body deal with the new growth, Ty unsnapped the jeans and then went to sit back down in his chair and witness the rest of the growth. <br />
<br />
Due to the growth now possessing his package, Mark's jeans slowly unzipped revealing the full growth now contained underneath in his now tight black briefs; the jeans just hanging on his hips. The growth seems to have stopped and before Ty stood the muscular guy from the poster on his wall, in place of the guy on the wall now was Mark's old body. Ty, fascinated and amazed by his friend that now stood with this perfect body in front of him, wished for him to unfreeze. Mark, suddenly aware of something had happened, looked down at his body,<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said in his now deeper and masculine voice, &quot;what the hell happened to my body?&quot; Mark stated as he slowly ran his hands down his now perfectly rounded pecs. &quot;Hey!&quot; he said pointing at the poster, &quot;that's me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was you&quot; Ty said now walking towards the now more manly Mark, &quot;this is the new you and I wished you to look like this&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; Mark said looking into Ty's eyes, but he couldn't think of any other way this could have happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Way,&quot; Ty said. Thoughts began to race through Ty's mind about what he could do next to make this situation more interesting, as Mark began to think of all the things he could do with his body right now as he stood there...</p>
