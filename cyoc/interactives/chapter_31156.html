<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Screw you, Jerk. Do your worst!”<br />
<br />
When Jacob yelled that, he hadn’t realized just how stupid it would sound coming out of a <br />
4 year old.  <br />
<br />
With a wicked grin on his face, Tim launched himself at the little boy who used to be his <br />
best buddy.  Jacob knew he really had nowhere to run, not that his little legs could take <br />
him anywhere anyway.  But when Tim’s, now, huge hands wrapped themselves around his <br />
tiny waist, Jacob tried his best to squirm free.  In a way, he quickly found he was helping <br />
Tim by doing that.<br />
<br />
“Do my worst, huh?” Tim said beginning to play with the snaps of Jacob’s tiny overalls. <br />
“Let’s start by getting rid of these.” The 14 year old said quickly pulling off the little boy’s <br />
outer covering.  The tiny shoes flipping off Jacob’s feet at the same time. <br />
<br />
Jacob found he was being held down while wearing only his training pants, that were <br />
rustling all the more, and a tiny t-shirt that didn’t even reach down to his baby belly.  The <br />
overalls and shoes, while still being incredibly small and childish, still slightly resembled <br />
adults clothes, as kid’s clothes tend to do.  But now, dressed only in the next best thing to <br />
a diaper and a tiny shirt, Jacob felt more childlike than ever.  Certainly the squeals and <br />
groans he was letting out while struggling to get free helped remind him even more.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get these out of the way so you can’t get back in them. Hope my B-ball skills are <br />
working tonight.” Tim said bunching the overalls into a small ball and tossing them so <br />
they landed on top of Jacob’s tall bookcase in his bedroom.  Far, far out of the 4 years old <br />
reach.  “Score!!  And I believe this was what you were asking for, Jakey.” <br />
<br />
Suddenly Jacob was shifted around and held down over Tim’s lap.  Oh no he wouldn’t!!!  <br />
Feeling Tim’s fingers slip into the back of the training pants, Jacob felt the plastic material <br />
being yanked down to his tiny knees, which held his legs together even tighter.  <br />
<br />
Tim looked down as his buddy’s little ass.  How cute and perfectly round it was.  Not like a <br />
teenagers at all anymore. Sure they were still in their early teens, but old enough that the <br />
results of their gym classes and years of bike riding were beginning to show off.  But not <br />
this ass, small and pert, with just a hint of powder.  Not for long though.<br />
<br />
Tim was careful for the first few swats on Jacob’s tiny ass.  He literally didn’t know his own <br />
strength in a situation like this, and wasn’t sure how much of his hand was needed to <br />
cover that 4 year old butt.  Tim did know what he wanted though.  He wanted his buddy to <br />
cry.  A good baby cry.  The kind kids have when they’re not even able to control it.  <br />
<br />
And that was what Jacob got, much to his shock.  Tim’s hand coming down on his little <br />
ass.  Over and over again. He could almost feel it getting redder with his swat.  He had the <br />
mind of a 14 year old still, but being housed in the body of a 4 year old meant almost <br />
nothing.  Teenage mind or not, it fucking hurt.  And in the shock, pain and <br />
embarrassment, Jacob started to plead.<br />
<br />
“Come on Tim…stop…stoopp!!!” but it was no use.  The pleads turned into tears.  And the <br />
more he heard his little voice give into the pain, the more Jacob gave up trying to hold the <br />
tears back. Couldn’t even try to get any words out, just crying and crying. His nose staring <br />
to run now, dripping into his mouth as the cries continued. Jacob was crying so hard he <br />
was even having some trouble breathing.  Which was as far a Tim wanted to take it.<br />
<br />
He didn’t even notice at first that Tim had stopped spanking him, not till he had been <br />
lifted of his friends lap and was being placed on the floor. “I think you’ve learned your <br />
lesson young man.” Tim said smiling down at the sniffling little boy on the floor. “And I <br />
think I learned something about spanking babies.  Sometimes they’re not whipped that <br />
great.” Tim said smelling his hand.  He got up from the bed and went into Jacob’s small <br />
private bathroom to wash up.<br />
<br />
It hurt like hell to stand up and more, but Jacob did it in a flash.  Leaving his trainers on <br />
the floor so their rustle wouldn’t draw Tim’s attention, he got his naked butt over to the <br />
desk, and up on the chair. Jacob figured that he only had time to do one thing, and he’d <br />
rather make sure he screwed Tim over than fix himself first.  A few more clicks and..<br />
<br />
“Son of a bitch!” said the cutest little girl voice he had ever heard from out of the <br />
bathroom.  Storming into the room was a three year old little girl version of Tim.  Jacob <br />
had left the ‘aware’ option on so his buddy could enjoy being a child again, if only a <br />
female child this time.  And at that age, it was diaper time.  Cute little yellow diapers that <br />
went with his yellow play dress and booties. ‘I’m going to killw y…”<br />
<br />
Tim stopped in mid word as Jacob clicked off the ‘aware’ function.  Meaning 3 year old <br />
Tina knew she was mad at her slightly older friend but not sure why. <br />
<br />
“Jakey not pway with ‘puter!!!  Ge’ dow’ or I tell Mommy!!” little Tina said, now all pouty <br />
and adorable in her anger.  The teenage fire that had been burning behind her eyes <br />
extinguished.<br />
<br />
“I can play with the computer.  That’s how I made your pee-pee go away.” Jacob said <br />
trying to talk down to her level.<br />
<br />
“My pee-pee no go ‘way.  See, I have pee-pee!!” Tina said pulling down his diaper and <br />
exposing her little girl privates. Now as a true child, completely unaware that it was not <br />
something little girls should do.  A quick toggle of the option and 14 year old Tim was <br />
back in the little girl’s head. <br />
<br />
“Hey dude, your outie turned into an innie.” Jacob said, pointing and laughing at his <br />
buddy’s new groin area.<br />
<br />
Tim was a bit confused but looked down to find himself naked from the waist down, his <br />
little girl vagina shoved out in the open.  “SEWOUSWY DUDE!!!  What the fuwck is WONG <br />
wi’f uu!!??” little girl Tim yelled.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong with me?  You’re the one who can’t hold it in.” Jacob said clicking another <br />
button.  Earlier in the evening Tim had made Jacob into a little girl and forced her new <br />
body to pee herself.  Now it was time for even more revenge.<br />
<br />
Tim just felt something between his legs give way and the warmish water begin to flow.  It <br />
wasn’t like when he was an adult guy and had somewhat control over the matter.  But now <br />
as a little girl, he could do nothing.  Not even putting his hand over his little privates did <br />
any good.  Except get pee all over his hands.  She was almost crying when she remember <br />
she did have some diapers at her feet. As humiliating as it was, it was her only out.  Tim <br />
bent down and pulled them up.  Finding these weren’t the brand from the commercials <br />
that bragged about keeping the wetness away from the skin.<br />
<br />
“Even pissing yourself you’re so ADOBRABLE Timmy.  You should stay like that.  Big <br />
improvement over the dumb ass you originally grew into.” Jacob smiled, switching the <br />
‘aware’ button off again. “Tina did you wet yourself again!!!”<br />
<br />
A confused Tina looked around and then felt his diaper. “Yeth.” She said with a slight lisp.<br />
<br />
“Mommy’s going to be real mad at you!!!  Tina made a pee-pee, Tina made a pee-pee!!” <br />
Jacob said pointing at the little girl and taunting her in a singsong mocking voice.  Little <br />
Tina’s lower lip quivered some and tears soon came to her eyes.  The three year old not in <br />
control over her emotions enough to keep from crying for no real reason at all.  As the <br />
tears streamed out, Jacob again clicked on the ‘aware’ button.<br />
<br />
“Sthop that!!!!” Tim said trying to get his 14 yeaqr old mind to get his three year old girl <br />
body to stop crying.<br />
<br />
“Sttttthhhhhhhhhop that!” Jacob said, again mocking her. “Make me SISSY!!!”<br />
<br />
Even Jacob was surprised at how quickly the little girl on the floor got to her feet and <br />
launched herself at the chair he was sitting in.  Must have been because Jacob didn’t weigh <br />
that much himself that she was able to knock the chair against the desk.  Jacob’s had <br />
swerving around the screen, doing random clicks without know what he was doing before <br />
falling to the floor. <br />
<br />
The room had a major shift, as did the entire house. Not that the two teenaged toddlers <br />
could have noticed.  They were fighting and pushing each other around, screaming in little <br />
child voices so high it was almost like a couple of cat’s fighting.  The youngsters didn’t <br />
even hear the sound of the heavy footsteps up the stairs, outside the door.<br />
<br />
“Tina!! Jackey!! What are you doing in here!??!” Jacob’s Mom yelled at them, pulling the <br />
children apart. “What are you doing in Daddy’s office!!!  And where are your clothes young <br />
man?!?!” <br />
<br />
Jacob looked around, his head spinning some.  Something must have happened with the <br />
programm when he got knocked off the chair.  But he wasn't sure what all had happened.  <br />
He sure was not used to his Mom towering over him again.  Now speaking to him like he <br />
was a child again too.  But it was true, he wasn’t in his room anymore.  Or maybe it was <br />
that his room wasn’t his room anymore.  It looked like his Dad’s office. That used to be <br />
across the hall, but now it was here.  The only thing left from his old room was…..his PC <br />
with the program in it.  Jacob only getting a brief look at his as he and Tina were dragged <br />
out of the room and across the hall.<br />
<br />
Now in what used to have been his Father’s office appeared to be his bedroom.  No wait, <br />
there were two beds in the room!!  A small youngster’s bed and a baby crib!!!  The room <br />
decorated with enough animals and play toys as to fit a little girl or a little boy.  As Tim <br />
and Jacob’s tiny eyes locked on each others they knew.  It was a room for a little boy AND <br />
a little girl. <br />
<br />
“And Tina you’ve messed yourself again!! Oh dear.  Take you back to Dr. Kaufmann to see <br />
why you’re peeing so much young lady.  Let’s get you cleaned and changed for bed.”<br />
<br />
Tim wasn’t sure what to do.  He felt like he was fully aware of everything.  He remembered <br />
being a 14 year old boy.  But he also knew he was a little girl and the lady he used to think <br />
of as Jacob’s Mom was now his…..no, HER MOM!!  Tim was lifted onto the changing table <br />
and quickly stripped of all her clothes. HER Mom went about cleaning the little girl up. It <br />
was when the giant woman he know thought of as his Mother started cleaning her baby <br />
genitals that Tim knew just how lost his maleness was.  He had never felt anything like <br />
this as a boy.  A fresh diaper was pilled on, along with plastic night protection over them.  <br />
Then a cute little girl sleeper was wrapped around him.  All yellow with chickies and <br />
bunnies on it.  Her Mom then brushed her longish hair for a bit, then lifted her up to lay <br />
her down in the crib.<br />
<br />
“Shouldn’t be giving you this, you’ll just pee it in a half hour but, you do sleep better.” <br />
Tina’s Mom said lowering a bottle down and holding it on Tina’s lips till they parted <br />
enough to take the rubber nipple in her mouth.  Tim hated milk.<br />
<br />
Jacob was next.  With only his little shirt still on it was easy for his Mom to strip him and <br />
get him on the changing table too.  While only 4 Jacob was a bit too old for the changing <br />
table, but it worked well enough to get his ready for bed.  As Tim found when his Mom <br />
was cleaning his new ‘equipment’ Jacob found how little his dick was now.  Jacob’s 14 year <br />
old mind tried to think back to a time before puberty took over and made his dick the <br />
center of his world.  But he couldn’t think back this far to where it was nothing more than <br />
a sliver of flesh.  As his Mom was putting some new trainers on his she stopped…<br />
<br />
“Jakey!!!  Why is you boom boom so red?!?!” she asked.  Jacob couldn’t answer that his <br />
three year old sister had given his ass a whooping back when SHE was a 14 year old BOY. <br />
“I swear of you’re getting a rash you’re BOTH going to the doctors!!  Let me make sure it’s <br />
not bad enough that you’ve got a fever.” His Mom said stepping away for a second.  Jacob <br />
lay there on his tiny belly, trying to think how he was going to get back to his old room <br />
and his computer before this got even worse.<br />
<br />
He should have been thinking about how ‘old school’ his Mom was.  About how in this <br />
reality maybe he wasn’t the only thing that was reverted to how it was when he was 4.  <br />
Like instead of a modern thermometer to take his temperature, his Mom would only have <br />
the old rectal thermometer to use.  Not even when his Mom used two fingers to part his <br />
little ass did Jacob know what was coming.  Only when the metal tip, followed by the glass <br />
shaft was shoved up his ass did the reality of what was going on hit him.  The highness of <br />
his squeal shocked even him.  <br />
<br />
“Jakey stop that!!  It’ll only take a minute!!” His Mom said trying to hold the squirming <br />
toddler down.  “The more you fuss the more it’ll hurt” she said shoving the shaft a bit <br />
farther into his ass.<br />
<br />
Jacob couldn’t believe this.  How something that seemed so incredibly small and thin felt <br />
like a baseball bat up his butt.  But when you’re as is so much smaller…..  He could feel <br />
the glass begin to get warmer from his own body heat.  Not that it made it any better. His <br />
Mom would shift it now and then, holding it in his ass to keep it secure.  He could feel the <br />
tip of it move around inside him.  After a few minutes Jacob found that had his little twig <br />
of flesh that was now his dick been able to get hard, it might have when his Mom pulled <br />
the thermometer out of his ass. Somehow giving pleasure he didn’t even want to think <br />
about.<br />
<br />
“A little high but that just could be from roughhousing with your sister.  We’ll check again <br />
in the morning.” <br />
<br />
Jacob was dressed up in his own little PJs. Covered in Pokemon characters and even with <br />
little footies at the end. A diaper well in place. It wasn’t really a real bed Jacob was lowered <br />
into, just something that would be a move from a crib to a grown up bed.  Low to the <br />
ground in case he fell out during the night.<br />
<br />
“You too be good and I’ll have Daddy come up and read you a bed time story.” <br />
<br />
Their Mom turned off the main light, leaving the room slightly bathed in a blue color <br />
coming from the nightlight by the door.  Jacob lay there for a minute again, trying to get a <br />
crib so he could figure out how they were going to get out of this.  As things began to <br />
come into focus there was a crash next to his bed.<br />
<br />
He jolted up and saw Tina’s baby bottle laying next to his bed.  And Tina standing up in <br />
her crib.  Leaning against the side where she must have just thrown her bottle at him.<br />
<br />
“Tha’ thermommy-meter din’ fuwk ‘uu haf’ as much as I gonna, ass howle.” She hissed <br />
from behind the bars.</p>
