<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Just before Marie and her group closed in on Glendale, the fairies told the witches that the <br />
fae's debt to them had been fulfilled and departed from the immediate area of Glendale to <br />
where, I have no clue, maybe their line continued, maybe they all died from old age, maybe <br />
the witches did unwitting achieve their goals with them and made them immortal or at <br />
least age less.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly asked, &quot;They were -helping- the witches all that time before then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Between when their rune experiment failed and just before Marie and her group arrived <br />
yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But they HAD to see what the witches were doing!&quot; Casandra protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;They did. However, to call these fairies created by the witches evil would be incorrect, and <br />
to call these fae unfeeling would be perhaps, unfair. They were not malicious, hostile, or <br />
apathetic, but they simply no longer thought in anything remotely resembling the humans, <br />
leomans, and lupmans they once were. Their brains structured was now completely <br />
different, and with the majority of their memories of who they were before simply gone, <br />
they had to reinvent themselves. <br />
<br />
And since the witches never actually -killed- or maimed their victims, the fairies didn't <br />
think what the witches was doing was evil, and since the souls remained in the artwork <br />
they created, they again thought the witches weren't actually harming anyone, since that <br />
was how they were able to comprehend such things. They weren't as draconic as the <br />
witches however, and didn't think 'all crimes were equal' and ironically were a bit objective <br />
in things. They sublimely flipped the gender of a wife beater and his wife, let the vast <br />
majority of hunters be, seeing them as little different from the wolf and coyote, of course <br />
this alien logic also... never mind. <br />
<br />
The point is that they while they couldn't consciously remember, they felt subconsciously <br />
indebted to the witches for bringing them into the world as they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Golgatha asked almost kindly, &quot;Joella?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleh,bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.&quot; The girl babbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Another failure.&quot; Golgatha said in a total sociopathic manner. She turned the girl to stone <br />
and shrunk her down, becoming a child nude statue the size of a nicknack with a thick <br />
base, sitting on her rear with her legs kneeling at her side. <br />
<br />
Golgatha took the latest attempt to recreate Joella and took it home where she placed it on <br />
her window cill. She didn't know the fairies added the mind inside to a mentally linked fairy <br />
garden that existed only in the minds of those Golgatha had turned into small statues after <br />
driving them mad from trying to make them into Joella. <br />
<br />
&quot;JOella?&quot; Lilly asked scared and confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even after everything she didn't let go of her, not longer waiting to become powerful <br />
enough to resurrect her, she chose to MAKE Joella using her own memories of her as a <br />
blkue print, of course this Joella would be just an ideal version of her rather than how the <br />
real one had acted as a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty looked sick, &quot;YOu say that like they eventually succeeded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did...after months of failures, the new Joella would be born around the fall of 1686. <br />
She'd live a happy innocent life with them for three years having no clue she was a <br />
replacement of another person with them.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;They obliterated another person just to make another? That's evil!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, by this point, they had already crossed the event horizon.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
Rosa Daleson. She was recorded as the youngest Matriarch in history, and one of the first. <br />
Pop culture and hearsay had that she had still been a child when she was assumed the <br />
reins of the Pride. Historians pointed out that her birthdate and when she became <br />
Matriarch had her into her adults years by the time she was recorded to have taken up the <br />
mantle. However the family stories (if slightly embellished) insisted that she had been a kid <br />
when becoming leader but with ability of someone twice her age. <br />
<br />
The wolves now listening to Glass Marie's story now knew the truth of course, of her aging <br />
being at least cut in half from the witch's experiments. And as Mal'akh would testify, Rosa <br />
had indeed appeared as a cub when she had become Matriarch... leaving her for some <br />
years to having to speak through proxies for the sake of being taken seriously with <br />
outsiders. However, as a point of self respect, she never used The Game to try and make <br />
herself older. <br />
<br />
Gillie of course knew none of this. She only looked on with a sense of curiosity, horror, <br />
dismay, and grim acceptance looking at her 'men.' <br />
<br />
Brian and Felicity looked at Gillie with familiarity and respect that Gillie would expect from <br />
any of her officers. Gillie glumly accepted that reality had taken their bull headed act of <br />
recklessness and rewarded them for it apparently.  <br />
<br />
Bobbi was still the largest chested woman there. But she was acting perfectly natural about <br />
it, no sarcasm or defensiveness in her attitude at all. Gillie guessed she had always been a <br />
woman and hadn't been made one by the game. <br />
<br />
Bernie looked totally comfortable with herself as well, not at all like the self conscious <br />
sometimes pudgy cop Gill had known. <br />
<br />
MJ and Wanda chatted away like a couple of overgrown teenage girls. <br />
<br />
<br />
Megan was talking with a green wolf that apparently shared her named.<br />
<br />
And Sasha was likewise chatting with a lavender wolf that -didn't- share her name and <br />
that was apparently something that was a personal joke to the two of them that Gill didn't <br />
get. <br />
<br />
Nellie and Lexi kept eying a black and gold leoman that Gillie didn't recognize.<br />
<br />
There was also four other lions, two men, two women, also there. <br />
<br />
Not to mention four on the table/beds he didn't recognize either! Apparently people from <br />
the Gallery like her grandfather. <br />
<br />
And of course there was Penny in her wheelchair with a plum colored wolf woman with a <br />
chest the size of double sized beach-balls in a kimono pushing her along, what was her <br />
name again? Umeko? <br />
<br />
 Gillie wondered which lion in here was Tabby. <br />
<br />
Even Gary, who had remained a man, acted different from how Gillie knew him to be. Gary <br />
looked like his heart had been torn out of him. <br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, it looked like to Gillie like some giant medical ward in a nudist colony, combined <br />
with a furry convention. They all had their badges on the nearby bed posts (and it made <br />
Gillie wonder if other transformed people would become police). <br />
<br />
These were not her men, not in the least, nor had ever been her men,  or could ever be her <br />
men, but they were her OFFICERS... she could take some small solace in that at least.</p>
