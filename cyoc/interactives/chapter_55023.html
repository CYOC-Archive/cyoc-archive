<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer walked down the hallway, muttering under her breath as she grabbed her backpack and headed for the front door.  &quot;That little twerp, the next time I see him I'll make him regret he was ever born.&quot;  She gave the door knob a quick twist and pulled open the door, only to comes face to face with the person currently on her mind.  Kyle stood there with a over sized grin on his face, still holding his cellphone in his hand.  He was a classic nerd, it was why she and her friends always picked on him.  He was thin, not fit thin though, just bony, and not what Jen would consider handsome.  He was only fifteen, two years younger than Jen.  His brown hair was a mess, and he was dressed in a pair of baggy jeans and an old Batman t-shirt.  In essence the complete opposite of anyone Jen would be caught dead with.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?  I should....&quot;  Her words died in her mouth as she tried to organize thoughts that suddenly weren't working anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I would miss out on this opportunity.  I was hoping you were home alone.&quot;  Kyle pushed in past the still stunned Jen, pulling the door closed.<br />
<br />
Kyle pushed Jen further back into the room, even as she felt the world start to wrench around her.  Something was wrong, it felt like reality was starting to rewrite itself.  Jen's clothing was evaporating, drifting away like streamers of smoke leaving her standing naked in her living room.  Kyle moved over to the couch and sat down, had she ever thought him nerdy?  She couldn't seem to recall, but she was in love with him, why should it matter.  No.. no she wasn't.  Thoughts kept switching in her mind, confusing her so she didn't even notice the changes beginning to occur to her body.<br />
<br />
Every part of her body seemed to be thickening, her arms, legs, chest, shoulders, even her hands and feet.  Kyle was watching her with interest, leaning back in her couch, his jeans were obviously tented from what he was seeing.  She had to give him that much, for a geeky runt, he wasn't lacking in that department.  &quot;What are you smirking at?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed again.  &quot;See, you and your friends always joked about me being gay.  Well, I am, and remember how I worded your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen's eyes went wide as she grabbed at her crotch.  Her fingers met with a sealing slit.  As she felt her diminishing woman hood, something else met the palm of her hand, a growing lump of flesh sticking out from her crotch.  At first it looked like nothing more than a small mound of flesh, but as it grew it took on a shape Jen knew all too well.  Oddly, the thought crossed her mind that her new cock wasn't circumsized, but for some reason that didn't surprise her.  Even though she had never seen this penis before, a part of her mind recognized it as hers, and even more disturbing, memories were filtering into her mind of always having it, memories of nights masturbating to porn or her crush.  In fact, it was growing increasingly hard to think of herself as a she.  The memories of Jennifer Smith seemed to be fading into the back ground, new memories were filtering in of Jonathan Smith.  Somethings were the same.  Same schools, same family vacations, same family for that matter.  But other things were changing.  The friends he had growing up, the toys he played with, and of course the fact that he was a /he/.<br />
<br />
Once the shaft of the penis had finally finished growing in, a heavy tugging preempted the dropping of his new testicles into the previously empty sac.  He noticed at first with a little disgust, but then with a growing sense of amusement that Kyle had opened his fly as was playing with his own cock as he watched.  Jon's chest was flattening, his former c-cup breasts and quarter sized nipples reforming into a firm pair of pecs with smaller dime sized nipples.  The tan that had previously went around his chest where his bikini top went slowly disappeared as his entire chest took on the tan that he tried to keep up.  He could see his long blond hair beginning to pull back into his head, were it eventually settled in a short cut, with his bangs spiked upwards.  His face began to take on more masculine features, the seventeen year old girl, giving way to the seventeen year old boy.  A firmer jaw and bolder nose, and generally sharper features quickly erased most of the femininity from his face.<br />
<br />
More memories started flooding into Jon's mind, similar memories pouring into Kyle's, though from the opposite side.  They had met last year when Kyle came in as a freshman.  Some of Jon's classmates had been picking on him, and Jon protected him, taking Kyle under his wing so to speak.  Eventually it came to each others' attention that they were both gay, and a relationship had sprouted from there. They kept their sexual relationship quiet, but the entire school knew they were friends.  And as Jon was popular, Kyle was as well.  With the new memories some more changes began to take affect, but not only on Jon, something was happening to Kyle to.  Jon had influenced him, instead of the nerdy type he had been before.  He was still smart, and into what some would consider geeky, Jon had changed things.  Kyle was growing, not the scrawny kid he had been before, he was putting on some muscle.  Not a whole lot, but memories of Jon and Kyle spending time together at the gym, or playing sports explained it.  It also explained the light tan that was replacing Kyle's normal pastiness.  His shaggy brown hair took on a more groomed appearance, but it still hung around his ears and covered his forehead.  His glasses faded away, replaced by contacts.  His Batman t-shirt changed into a black tank top, showing of the developement on his arms, that Kyle had worked so hard for.  And the unzipped bluejeans turned into a pair of cargo shorts pooled around his ankles.<br />
<br />
Kyle seemed oblivious to the small changes overtaking him as he stroked himself and watched Jon, who was still changing himself.  Muscle was packing on his broader frame, not large amounts, but he was decently athletic, memories of being on the baseball team coming to the forefront of his mind.  The fine hairs on his arms and legs darkened to a pale brown as they grew longer.  The pubic hair that he had so carefully kept shaved off as a woman was now growing back in, and thicker than before, nestling around the base of his new penis and moving up in a trail to his navel.  More hair grew in between his pecs, spreading out slightly across his chest.  The hair continured to grow and spread for a bit, finally stopping.  He was slightly hairier than most seventeen year olds, but not unnaturally so.  He had used to keep himself shaved down, but Kyle liked Jon's hair, having so little himself.  Last an itching along Jon's jaw meant his beard was growing in, but shaved, with only a bit of stubble on his jaw and cheeks, except for the sideburns that went just past his ears and the scruff on his chin, also Kyle's idea.<br />
<br />
Just like his clothes disappeared before, his clothes reappeared.  A pair of jeans and a t-shirt with the school's mascot tiger on it, proclaiming him on the baseball team.  Jon walked over to Kyle who was still stroking himself and moved the vigorously working hands away from the shaft, instead taking it into his mouth.  A minute's work was enough to bring the younger teen to climax, of which Jon swallowed every drop before leaning forward to kiss his boyfriend.  The memories of Jen still sat nestled in the back of his mind, faint and dream-like, but the memories of Jon were what felt real.  And by the way Kyle was responding, his memories were the same way.  They smiled at each other, both knowing the affection they other felt for them.  Then with a mischievous smile Jon leaned forward and whispered into Kyle's ear.  &quot;I have an idea, just trust me.  Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
