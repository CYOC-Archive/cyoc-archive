<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her plan had been that the moment she got off the bus, she would head straight home to see if her mom or dad was home from work and to see if she could get the keys for her car back right away. But, after bidding Chastity, &quot;See you later,&quot; Bets waited until the bus had pulled away before turning and crossing the street.<br />
<br />
Ever since she had let the mall, she&#39;d been feeling off. A cramping sensation had settled in her stomach, while a feeling of warmth had spread through her crotch. And there was other things, like the pressure she felt mixing with the cramping sensation, plus the odd tingly, pins and needles feeling, and how sensitive the nipples of her breasts felt as they shifted gently against the lace-up belly top she was wearing, which led her to believe she might be getting her period and made her regret her decision to go without any underwear and a bra that morning. Gazing down at her skirt, a garment she thought was cute, she ran a hand over the denim part, which started at her waist and went to about the point her legs began, shuddered at the feeling of how soft and comfortable it was, and resisted the urge to touch the lower half, which was a soft cotton, multi-tiered number that went down a quarter way of her leg before stopping. Stepping up onto the sidewalk, she withdrew her hand, suddenly feeling self-conscious that somebody might be watching, and looking around, seeing nobody, she got her bearings and headed in the direction of the nearby pharmacy and chemist.<br />
<br />
A couple blocks over, the houses started giving way, slightly, to older stores that were left over from the nineteen fifties that hadn&#39;t truly given way to the larger, mega-department stores. Spotting the store she was looking for, a small, mom-and-pops-type place called Belkin&#39;s Pharmacy and Chemist Shoppe, Bets adjusted her purse strap and began to hurry. Her high-heel shoes making a sharp noise as they clicked against the sidewalk, the sixteen-year-old girl reflected on how the issues she was experiencing seemed to be getting worse and how embarrassing it would be if she started to have her cycle right now, before she could buy some tampons.<br />
<br />
Certain she was blushing, Bets focused on the her destination and tried to ignore everything else. Passing one of the larger stores, she stopped suddenly, backtracked and peered in through the plate-glass window. On display was a camping scene, complete with a tent, a faux fire, a picnic table, set out with food, and, what really drew her attention, a deer. Gazing at the plastic decoration, unaware of the lustful look on her faces, Bets snorted in excitement as she took in how the doe seemed unafraid, had its tail up and appeared to waiting for something. Grinning, the sixteen-year-old girl whispered, &quot;I bet you&#39;re waiting for some big strapping buck, aren&#39;t you,&quot; and forgetting where she was going, and why, Bets headed inside the store.<br />
<br />
Inside, her mind focused intently on  examining the doe, Bets stopped. Breathing deeply, she peered warily around the store and seeing a bag of feed corn, she forgot the statue in the window. Picking up one of the bag, she again glanced around the store, but not seeing any people, she began to wander. Ambling gracefully to the back of the store, following a scent that seemed to amplify the feelings that had moments ago been bothering her, Bets soon entered an aisle that sold musk, pheromones and other deer scents. A series of grunts escaping her, Bets sniffed and after a moment, selected a couple spray-canisters of doe pheromones that promised 100 percent satisfaction in luring a trophy buck. Turning, she started back the way she came, the warmth in her crotch growing as a slick feeling also started to form, she stopped after a bit and glanced down at what she was carrying.<br />
<br />
Confused, wondering why she was holding such stuff, Bets studied the twenty pound bag of feed corn, read the label of the pheromones and shuddered when she realised that she&#39;d taken the stuff not only because of how she was feeling, but also because she&#39;d intended to take it with out paying. Again, certain she was turning red, Bets muttered, &quot;Just great. You&#39;re about to get your keys back and you want to shop lift crap that you don&#39;t even need,&quot; and turning, she started back toward where she got the spray canisters.<br />
<br />
Still feeling wary about crossing paths with any floor sales person, especially since she wasn&#39;t sure how to explain why she was holding what she was, the sixteen-year-old girl passed another mock-up of campsite, stopped and doubled back. Seeing another plastic doe, she made a sort of combination snorting-grunting noise and licked her lips. Thought about how the doe was flagging causing her to feel even more amorous, Bets stepped closer to the camping scene. Dropping the bag of feed corn and the spray-canisters, she leaned in closed and sniffed the butt-end of the statue. Smelling only plastic, she wrinkled her nose and reached for one of the cans. Spraying the backside of the doe liberally, Bets again leaned down, noticing as she did a book on deer sitting nearby, and breathing deeply the pheromone rich scent, she grunted, stood and began pressing herself against the statues rump.<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising what it was she was doing, even as she continued to thrust against the plastic doe, Bets giggled a high, hysterical noise. Thinking, &quot;I know I may be attracted to girls, which I suspect Diane suspects, but this is ridiculous,&quot; and forcefully pulling herself away, she glanced quickly about to make sure she hadn&#39;t been seen and, seeing that she was still alone, she took a couple steps backward, intent on fleeing before she could do anything else.<br />
<br />
But then she saw the book a second time and realised the page it was opened to.<br />
<br />
Once again making a serious of grunting noises, Bets reached down and picked up the book. Gazing longingly at the images of does, she muttered something like, &quot;So rutiful,&quot; and collecting the back of feed corn and one of the canisters, she climbed into the tent.<br />
<br />
Inside, she lay down on the sleeping bag and, still eyeing the book hungrily, Bets reached back and zipped up the opening. Reaching next for the pheromones, she began to spray the inside liberally, loving the smell and the way it seemed to ease the discomfort she&#39;d been experiencing since the mall. Tossing aside the can, she quickly pulled on the draw-string that laced up the front of her top, which fell away the instant there was nothing holding it in place. Her C cup breasts thrusting past the tight, small jean jacket she was wearing, Bets kicked off her high heel shoes, fumbled a bit with her skirt before getting that off as well and lying on the sleeping bag, wearing only a jacket, breathing in the pheromone rich air, she began thumbing through the book. Growing more and more horny with each image of does, the sixteen-year-old girl eventually reached down and slipped her hand between her legs and abruptly stopped.<br />
<br />
As if suddenly aware of what she was doing, and the fact that she was nearly nude, Bets glanced down at her crotch, which felt weird to touch and was what had brought her to her senses. Peering at the smooth, flat skin, she snorted and leaned forward, trying to see betwixt her legs. Failing that, certain that something was wrong, she tentatively used her hand to explore the area and almost immediately came to the conclusion that her clit felt wrong. Leaning forward as far as she could, Bets spread her legs and tried to look a second time, thinking that if she didn&#39;t know any better, the area in question not only felt more pronounced, but also looked like it. Concerned by this, and what she was doing, she flopped back and staring upward, she whispered, &quot;What the hell am I doing,&quot; and reaching for the bag of feed corn, not giving a second though to what she was doing, the sixteen-year-old girl tore open the top and began to first scoop out the corn, then turned over and instead planted her face into the bag and began to eat the contents.<br />
<br />
Unaware that she was again losing control, Bets quickly polished off the bag of feed corn and rolling over, she found herself wishing she&#39;d gotten two bags as she breathed in the still pheromone rich air. Snorting and grunting a after a bit, she considered that she should get dressed and get the hell out of there before someone discovered her, but spotting the book, she picked it up and began thumbing through it. Seeing it was a field guide to deer that ranged from anything about behaviour, to mating, to life cycles, to normal food consumed, Bets began to idly play herself as she peered lovingly at the images of the does. Her clitoris growing more and more pronounced the more horny she became, she had a momentary flash that something was wrong before she changed her tactics and began teasing her morphing genitalia.<br />
<br />
When her clit, clitoris hood, urethra and part of her vulva fused together, Bets missed entirely what had happened. The pressure she was feeling descending lower and lower, she snorted and grasped the newly growing organ and using the juices that accumulated on her hand, she began to stroke it. Her snorts giving way to grunts that were borderline bellows, about the time the rest of her vulva fused together and set of fully functional testicles dropped down into her scrotum, she had just enough sense to grab the empty feed bag before her newly formed penis let loose, spraying the inside with cum. Afterward, feeling both content and that something was off, Bets lay on the sleeping bag, staring up at the canvas top, letting her mind wander as she tried to figure out what felt odd.</p>
