<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was no hiding her belly as she got to the classroom, the sweater was covering it and the fact it was black was a little sliming on her but it was like having a small exercise ball under her sweater and pretending like it’s not there. She wasn’t actually walking on the bus so she didn’t realize that her walk became more of a waddle. It was big and heavy and was taking no small amount of effort to maintain her balance.<br />
<br />
Ignoring it she continued to class she reached the door and struggled to pull it open around her awkward belly, she was not used to being pregnant. She accidentally pulled the door into her belly in her attempt to maneuver around the massive orb causing the occupant of said orb to begin to get restless.<br />
<br />
“Sorry for being late sir, I had an issue with my cheer uniform…on the bus.” Jen said trying to ignore the stares of indifference from her classmates.<br />
<br />
Without looking away from the whiteboard he sighed before saying, “Just sit down Ms. Smith. This is not the first time you interrupted class and it won’t be the last time, I am sure of that.”<br />
<br />
She waddled to her desk just to realize her belly was to big, she couldn’t fit even if she wanted to.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Mr. Walker? I can’t fit in my desk.”<br />
<br />
This caused a few kids to stifle a laugh as the looked at Jennifer’s plight of having a belly that extended past the standard combined student desks.<br />
<br />
Frustrated by her interruptions to his lecture he turned around and looked at her. His face contorted from anger to confusion to repulsion and finally to a scowl.<br />
<br />
“Ms. smith, take a seat at my desk and quietly get ready, you have already interrupted my class multiple times since you walked in the door not two minutes ago; one more outburst and you will get yourself a one way trip to the principals office. Do I make myself clear?” he said letting some of his repulsion at her appearance seep through into his words as he yelled at her.<br />
<br />
He turned around and continued his lecture without sparing her a second glance. Jennifer quietly waddled over to his desk, which was currently a fold out plastic table thanks to an un-named football captain tackling one of the freshmen up and coming track stars into it last week breaking two of the legs. <br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the rolling chair and debated how she was going to sit down in it as she is liable to miss the chair of she is not ready.<br />
<br />
Deciding to carefully drop into the chair while it was pinned against the desk and then swiveling back around would be the best option.<br />
She quietly positioned the chair and then herself before unceremoniously and un gracefully dropping into the chair; this causing a few more stifled giggles and whispers.<br />
<br />
Jennifer just ignored the whispers; finally she was ready to begin class. There was only about 20 minutes to go but she made it!<br />
<br />
She was finding it difficult to work around her belly. It was just so big, but she was trying to make it work, everything has gone wrong today she just needed a bit of normalcy and monotony.<br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes of trying to focus she felt some movement and kicks. The insect was squirming around in her stomach.<br />
<br />
“No!” she whispered to herself as she realized what was happening. <br />
<br />
Quickly she forced herself out of the chair having it clatter behind her as she hastily stood up; she regained her balance and began quickly waddling to the door, she had to get out! The issue was the path between the student desks was narrow. Looking for the fastest way out of the room she noticed the center most aisle was wider then the others and made a break for it.<br />
<br />
She clenched her pussy to try and hold it in as the kicking became more fervent.<br />
<br />
“Ms. Smith! What is the meaning of yet another outburst from you?!” Mr. Walker said as he turned around to see Jennifer scrambling past the desk and towards the center aisle no doubt trying to leave the classroom.<br />
<br />
He stepped in front of her just before she made it to her exit path.<br />
<br />
“Please sir, I have to get out of here right now!” Jennifer pleaded staring at him with panicked eyes.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Ms. Smith, this behavior is completely unacceptable you need to go to the principals office right now; grab your things and go!”<br />
<br />
N-No, I can’t, I have to ge-“ she stammered trying to contain the unrelenting kicking and scrambling happening in her womb.<br />
<br />
Like a deluge a gush of green goo flooded out of her expanded vagina.<br />
<br />
“No! Please not here!” she screamed as it happened again.<br />
<br />
Her legs gave out from under her and she dropped to her hands and knees noticing now that Mr. Walker as well two classmates in the first row, Clare and Ben didn’t know it when they chose their seats but they were in the splash zone today and their pants and shoes were now drenched in the green goo.<br />
<br />
Similar to before she felt the coordinated struggling of a new insect girl trying to claw their way out, the only exception this time was that the insect was using the newly expanded exit hole. Jennifer panted as she tried not to look at her classmates that were screaming which she couldn’t hear over the mixture of pain and pleasure she was currently enraptured in.<br />
<br />
Her new skirt flipped up when a wet carapace-covered hand reached out of her pussy and moved it out of the way. It was significantly less painful then the last time probably because of what the first cockroach did to her. But now she was feeling every hair on the chitinous arm slide out of her some rubbing her clit causing small jolts of pleasure as she moved around trying to get out.<br />
<br />
Against her better judgment she opened her eyes and looked at her classmates from her position on the floor. Most of the students in the front row were scrambling away from the expanding puddle of green goo that was pooling on the carpeted floor. Some of the students were watching in horror, others had their phones out.<br />
<br />
Whatever the faces that were looking at Jennifer the common denominator was the trace of pure disgust mixed into everyone’s expressions at what was happening.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was so ashamed of herself, this was by far the most humiliating thing she has ever experienced and it was just starting.<br />
<br />
“Please someone help me!!” Jennifer yelled to the students as tears began to stream down her face.<br />
<br />
Finally the hand got some leverage and was able to start pulling herself out. With no one moving to help her she was out of options, Jennifer began pushing to try and speed up her torment at least a little.<br />
<br />
She was met with the sloppy sound of more goo spraying out of her pussy and slapping against the desk she just left coating her notebooks and bag in the goo.<br />
<br />
Finally the second arm got free and the girl was able to pull herself free with a wet thump and splat. <br />
<br />
Looking back she saw a similar cockroach-girl panting on the ground behind her. She had shorter hair and her carapace was a lighter brown then her sister but was built similar.<br />
<br />
“Freedom!!!” She yelled as she rolled over onto her back. She sat there for a few moments before starting to get up.<br />
<br />
Jennifer knowing what happened next she forced the feelings of her afterglow down and decided to run. If that girl got up first Jennifer would be fucked…literally and then have another birthing.</p>
