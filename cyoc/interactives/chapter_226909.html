<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Sit your fury behinds down at the table now,” Brittany practically snarling as she escorts her fraternal twin cubs home from school. The six year old Anthro charcoal grey furred male wolf fury and anthro doe-deer fury named Dusk and Dawn respectively were caught trying to blow up a garbage can using baking soda and vinegar. Fortunately at their age the cubs had no idea that the two household ingredients would only make a foamy mess and cause no real damage.<br />
“You mind explaining to me why you thought blowing up a garbage can during lunch was such a good idea,” The angry wolf fury stating as she glares at her cubs. She and Jake already got a comprehensive summation of the facts. They were seen by dozen of students messing with a garbage can; pouring a white powder, which was later determined to be baking soda. Followed by the vinegar; all agreed it was vinegar thanks to its distinct and pungent aroma to a fury’s nose, a nose far more sensitive than a human’s. “Well,” Brittany staring at her cubs; “out with it! Or do you need another season with your fur dyed pink,” Brittany scaring a response from her cubs; reminding them that when they tried to torment their cousin and his cat, their aunt wasn’t having it and used her runes to change the color of their fur to bright pink. A color that stuck with them up until their winter coats grew in.<br />
<br />
“We wanted to make elephant’s toothpaste,” Dusk speaking first; his eyes wide with fright at the possibility of enduring another summer and fall as the pink wolf.<br />
“Really,” Brittany staring at her son; her runes glowing as if to ready the aforementioned punishment; “what made you think baking soda and vinegar were the ingredients to make that?”<br />
“We saw a video on the internet,” Dawn speaking up; try to use her big doe eyes to her advantage, it was a look she used on her father to get out of trouble. Sadly her mother was not buying it and just continued to glare.<br />
“You may have hypnotized dad with that look,” Brittany scoffing; “but it won’t work on me. Go to your rooms both of you,” Brittany adds with a growl; “and stay there until I say otherwise.”<br />
<br />
Neither needs any further encouragement as they quickly scampered out of the kitchen and headed to their respective prisons. Brittany sighed as she grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat down at the table. Summoning her phone, she looks up online for Elephant’s toothpaste. She groans as she takes a sip from the bottle.<br />
“Hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide with warm water or dish soap,” Brittany reading out load; “they were using the wrong ingredients.” Reading further to find out that while hydrogen peroxide was readily available at a pharmacy or grocery store; it was the potassium iodide that had her flummoxed. Looking up online, she could not find a store that would sell it in quantities greater that a couple of pills or tablets for use to protect the thyroid gland from absorbing radiation. Readily available for free to those that reside near nuclear reactor power plants. She shudders as to how Dusk and Dawn would go about in acquiring the amount needed to make what they were claiming. She sends Jake a short text explaining what she managed to get out of their trouble makers before putting her phone down.<br />
“They may be in trouble,” Brittany looking at the time; “but I’m not going to starve them. So leftovers in the fridge for them.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
Jake Proudhoof was at his father’s restaurant helping to run the kitchen. Assisting the line cooks and executive chef to expedite the orders while managing the back. His brother Jimmy was the front end manager and head bar tender; Jimmy also managed the books and help with the scheduling of staff. He puts down the bowl full of egg whites and whisk as he notices a rune on his wrist blinking. Figuring out years ago that it was an indication that he had a message, Jake summons his phone to see the message Brittany just sent him.<br />
“Elephant’s Toothpaste,” Jake mutters to himself; reading the brief summary that she managed to pry from their cubs. He chuckles at the thought of her carrying out the threat of making them spend the rest of the year with their fur dyed pink.<br />
“Thanks for update,” Jake quickly typing; “busy at work. Will talk more when I get home.” Jake hits send and puts his phone away; going back to the bowl of egg whites he was beating into a merengue.<br />
<br />
“So they thought baking soda and vinegar is all they needed for elephant’s toothpaste,” Jimmy Proudhoof  shaking his head as he and his twin brother take a quick break from the busy dinner service. The anthro stag-deer rolling his eyes as he takes a sip of his coffee; finding the latest antics of his niece and nephew treading closer to hooliganism than just plain pranking.<br />
“Not sure if it’s the truth coming from them,” Jake sighing; “Brittany threatened to do to them what Allison did last year.”<br />
“Hahahaha,” Jimmy busts out laughing; remembering what those two tried to do to earn his mate’s swift wrath. Thinking it was okay to torment Jimmy J.R and their cat Dickens. Trying to shave the cat while holding down Jimmy J.R. It was his cries that got Allison’s attention and she ended up coming down on the two like a pissed off sow bear rescuing her cubs. “If Brittany follows through,” Jimmy cackling; “make sure you take a picture. Add it to the yearly Christmas letter for posterity.”<br />
“I’ll take it under advisement,” Jake finishing up his coffee; “but I was thinking of sending them off to a reform school for troubled children. But I’m not sure if that is a good thing or not.”<br />
“I can’t tell you how to parent your cubs,” Jimmy getting up; “but whatever you do, make sure Brittany is on board. Me,” the anthro stag-deer looking at his twin brother; “I’m thinking of sending J.R to summer camp. He seems introverted and could use a change of scenery for a few weeks. Maybe give him the gentle shove he needs to be more outgoing instead of reserved,” Jimmy S.R adding; “I just needto get Allison on board with the idea.”<br />
“I’m sure you’ll find a way,” Jake getting up to go back inside; “We got a few more hours of this madness before we can muck out. Let’s just get it done.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
<br />
Jake was right in regards to the madness. Apart from being kept busy in the kitchen, both his father and brother were doing what they could to keep everyone from trying turn the restaurant into a sex dungeon. Yes furies are sexually promiscuous, ambivalent and bisexual; however, there were boundaries that a respectable business such as theirs was not willing to cross. Jake could hear some of the more heated arguments coming from the dining room were several patrons, clearly intoxicated had to be escorted out as they found out the hard way that the waiters and waitresses were not about to earn tips on their backs. Some were now spending the evening in the drunk tank because they were too belligerent, despite being only slightly intoxicated.<br />
<br />
So when he got home, Jake was surprised to see Brittany still up. Looking at the time and seeing it was only 11:30, he figured she would already be in bed as she had a substitute teacher job for tomorrow.<br />
“Did Dusk and Dawn give more details,” Jake sitting on the couch next to the anthro wolf fury; “or are they still sticking to the elephant toothpaste?”<br />
“They won’t budge,” Brittany shaking her head; “even after I explained to them what the ingredients were for their prank.”<br />
“You think it would be a good idea to send them to a reform school to scare them straight,” Jake asking; seeing Brittany’s sinister wolfish grin implies that she already did something to try and smarten their cubs up.<br />
“Oh you didn’t,” Jake getting up to head to Dusk’s room; opening the door to see his son asleep but half of his fur dyed pink. He looks at Brittany as she motions for him to check on Dawn. Opening the door to her room, he stares in shock as his daughter also has half her fur dyed pink.<br />
“I waited until they were asleep,” Brittany doing her best to stifle a cackle; “Oh will they be surprised come morning. And the only way I’ll undo the dye job,” the wolf fury grinning malevolently; “is if they start telling the truth.”<br />
<br />
“They are so going to be tormented at school,” Jake closing the door as he shakes his head; “this is only going to end badly.”<br />
“They also have a choice to make for school punishment,” Brittany leading her mate to bed; “in school suspension for 2 weeks. It’s where they spend their suspension under the close supervision of the principal. Or they spend the whole of summer break helping the janitor buff and polish the floors for the new school year.”<br />
“Have they decided,” Jake already sitting on the bed; summoning his phone and placing it on the night stand nearby.<br />
“They’ll have to decide tomorrow,” Brittany giggling as she climbs on top of her mate; “when they are given the choice by the principal. But right now,” the wolf fury leaning in for a kiss; “I want a good snuggle from you.”<br />
“Just a snuggle,” Jake smiles crookedly; his cervine shaft starting to press into Brittany and he can already feeling the urge to begin bucking and thrusting; “because it seems you want more.”<br />
<br />
“Then you know what to do then,” Brittany leaning in again to give Jake a nibble on his ear; she growls happily at feeling her mate enter her and quickly fill her tunnel up as they both begin to gyrate and buck to their respective peaks. Sensing Jake’s hoof hands gripping her hip as she rides him; enjoying the air caressing her pert nipples as her breasts bounce in time to each thrust from the fury below. She collapses on top of Jake as soon as she hears him grunt as he cums inside her; feeling his shaft spasm and twitch as her muscles clamp and begin milking the rod, drinking up his essence as he pumps it in her.<br />
“Feeling better now,” Jake placing a hoof hand on Brittany’s fury rear end; her tail wagging as she adjusts her legs to lie comfortably on top of her mate.<br />
“For the moment,” Brittany murmuring; allowing sleep to finally claim her.</p>
