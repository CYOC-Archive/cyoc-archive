<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kusheil was on his third cup of coffee as he reviewed the file that was placed on his desk. It was a brief overview of Enoch Morningstar. After his meeting with the son of Lucifer; Kusheil stormed back to his office to seethe. The wolftaur demon; Kushiel refused to acknowledge that he is an angel now, embarrassed him as he once again was denied to talk to a prisoner that should by right be in his custody. So Kusheil glared; raged at what was becoming in his mind, an unstable situation. He desired control; he desired order. Kusheil desired the days when Angels and demons warred with each other.<br />
<br />
The fact that his magical surveillance device that he placed at the Papilio estate got nothing but the two demons in his mind rutting like mad, did nothing to cheer him up. He debated turning it on again; but thought better.<br />
‘Those whore are most likely still fucking each other,’ Kusheil thought sourly. So he turned back to the file in his desk.<br />
<br />
‘Enoch Moringstar. Year of birth, approximately 2600BC; per Gregorian calendar. Current age: approximately 4600 years plus or minus two decades.<br />
Not much is known in regard to the first son of Lucifer save for the following. Third child to Lucifer and Lilith. Proserpina and Nocticula Morningstar are the eldest. While Nocticula is mentioned as the eighth daughter, theory indicates that this is noted as she is the archduchess of the eighth circle of hell. Rumor is Enoch is her favorite sibling.’<br />
Kusheil put the document down to grab his coffee; he grumbles as he notices the cup empty.<br />
“Perhaps I’ve had enough,” Kusheil sighing as he put down the cup<br />
<br />
‘First Entry.<br />
Date: 2500BC Location: Now modern day Greece.<br />
IT was around this time the Enoch was first spotted by agents of the Inquisition that he was seen along with Commander Baal hanging around in the Palace of Dionysus. An Nagel Satyr with rams horns and an insatiable appetite for hedonism and debauchery. The incident in question revolved around a wager as to who commit the largest act of bestiality involving sheep. A challenge that Dionysus could not refuse. Rumor has it that this is the one time that Dionysus was out rutted by a demon.<br />
<br />
The Fallout.<br />
Information is sketchy; handed down from those that visited the court of Dionysus. Enoch Morningstar was made to spend 500 years in the sulphur mines living and working with the Kobold miners. After his sentence he was given a choice by his father. Serve another 500 years in the mines or begin a career as a judge. Encoh choose the judiciary.<br />
<br />
Second Entry.<br />
Date: 1196A.D Location: Dis, Ninth Circle of Hell<br />
The alliance between King Richard and Saladin created the Iron Knights. The large army was given the tools needed to invade hell and managed to besieged and hold Dis; shocking the inhabitants. However, the soldiers started slaughter women and children demons; once Enoch saw this, he proceeded to personally lead a counteroffensive. It is rumored that the crusaders loaded their pants that the sight of a demon wolftaur barreling down on them. It was this attack that forced the Iron Knights to begin retreating back to Earth.’<br />
<br />
“That explains why I had to rescue Richard and Saladin,” Kusheil pursing his lips; “and it says here that he stopped being a judge shortly after. Having to sentence the same knights he personally killed,” Kusheil chuckled; “how poetic.”<br />
<br />
Third Entry.<br />
Date: 1943AD Location: Auschwitz, Poland<br />
The following is based off of suspected eyewitness accounts from several demons that were tortured for information. The facts have yet to be verified.<br />
Enoch Mornistar was seen dressed as a Waffen-SS officer attempting to infiltrate the German Concentration camp. Rumor was that this was a rescue mission to free a human woman he fell in love with. While accounts are sketchy, it is assumed that the rescue mission was a failure and the son of Lucifer has since been alone as he wandered the Earth.<br />
<br />
“Well isn’t that interesting,” Kusheil commenting; “I wonder who it was that you fancied?”<br />
Kusheil went to the next page to read more, but was disappointed; there were pages missing. Pages he personally added as they noted further sightings. Sightings of Enoch at concerts, festivals and important moments of Human history.<br />
“The testimony of Tarfeil is missing,” Kusheil swearing; “I added that yesterday!”<br />
<br />
************************************<br />
<br />
Semyaza smiled as he examined the files he took, before Kusheil ordered that they be handed over to him; files pertaining to Enoch’s forays on Earth. Semyaza wanted to remove the entire set, however that would arise suspicion; he wanted to ensure that if Kusheil went on a tirade he could easily steer the ill-tempered angel in the appropriate direction.<br />
“I apologise Kusheil,” Semyaza couching his words as he destroyed the documents with a magic fire spell; “but I was ordered personally to remove said documents.<br />
“Who you ask,” Semyaza doing a half decent enraged Kusheil.<br />
“Why Jehovah himself,” Semyaza answering; grinning as he thought about the angel trying to attack the lord of heaven infront of everyone.<br />
‘Jove will now suit mine and Beelzebub’s purposes,’ Semyaza muses; ‘and it should be easy once Jehovah takes away your harem.’<br />
“And now we wait,” Semyaza pouring himself a glass of red wine; “now we wait.”<br />
<br />
*****************************************************************<br />
The Arch-Angel Michael looks at his nephew as the arrived at the heavenly palace. Seeing the angelic white furred wolftaur wearing another questionable t-shirt when addressing council, his nephew Enoch chided back; “I could have easily not wore anything. My penis is tucked into a furry sheath just like a regular wolf and my tail does conceal by furry balls when not in motion. Add the fact that my wings further obscure my genitals.”<br />
Michael got the point; rolling his eyes as Enoch added; “you can take the demon out of hell, but you can’t take the hell out of a demon.”<br />
“You’re not a demon anymore,” Michael adding; “you need to stop acting like one.”<br />
“By having the same drab fashion sense as the rest of you,” Enoch answering as they entered the palace; “As if I’d be caught wearing white on top of my now white fur. I thought Gia was going to join,” Enoch starring at the council as they waited on Jehovah’s arrival.<br />
“Well you did give her that flower and book regarding the plant life in hell,” Michael replying as he nodded to Jesus and Sandalphon; “just please act civil. This isn’t like how it’s done in hell.”<br />
“Like what is done in hell,” Enoch enquiring; “politics? You mean Belial isn’t going to barge in and eviscerate a condemned human soul as part of his grand entrance? There will be no attempt on Lucifer or my mother’s life,” Enoch adding; “A Kobold named Braxis won’t be trying to fondle your nether’s as he tries to jack off? And that is a slow day,” Enoch smiling; “for hellish politics.”<br />
“Forget I asked,” Michael dreading bringing up the conversation as Jehovah arrives.</p>
