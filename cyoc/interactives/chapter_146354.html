<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Easter this year was a lot more pleasant than last year. The spring had come at its usual time and it was a bright, sunny day. Jessica and Roger were taking a short drive around the neighborhood to take a look. People didn&#39;t decorate their houses for Easter nearly as much as they did for Halloween and Christmas, but some of them had some colorful streamers or big eggs on their lawn. More importantly, there were a lot of flowers coming up. A lot of them wouldn&#39;t be in full bloom for a few more weeks, but there were enough to make some gardens look pretty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna drive by the Meat Market?&quot; asked Roger, though he was obviously not being serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;m good,&quot; said Jessica, &quot;I don&#39;t wanna give Shyra more ammo.&quot; Their first meeting last year was really awkward, but after time, Jessica had grown to like Shyra. She had learned to keep herself in check and not push Jessica into awkward situations. She was sorta like the older sister Jessica never had, doing girl stuff together when Jessica&#39;s other friends aren&#39;t available. Of course, Shyra had also taken Jessica under her wing and was encouraging her to be a sexier rabbit. Jessica didn&#39;t deny she wanted to learn a few things, but she wasn&#39;t going to be showing off all the time, excepting the occasional magazine cover or photos at the beach.<br />
<br />
Though the real reason Jessica didn&#39;t want to run into Shyra today was because she&#39;d knew what Shyra would try to do. Sophie and Roland losing their virginity together wasn&#39;t common knowledge. Though a lot of people suspected it anyways. Jessica and Roger felt a little pressure in their group of friends for being the only virgins in it. And while Shyra wasn&#39;t trying to force her, she had been dropping a lot of hints that Jessica and Roger should get on with it. But Jessica wanted their first time to be special and wasn&#39;t about to rush into it.<br />
<br />
Jessica eventually parked her car at the park. She was a lot more confident about driving it than she was a year ago. It help that the roads weren&#39;t icy and slick. Jessica was feeling more confident with her body as well. She wasn&#39;t exactly skinny and flat when she first converted over two years ago, but she had filled out quite a bit since that. And she wasn&#39;t even at full maturity yet. Shyra said that Jessica may end up as big-chested as herself and Jessica was actually hoping she was right. Though unlike real women, she&#39;d have an Animalian&#39;s musculature and stamina to keep from having back problems later.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it&#39;s great that they have someone else be the Easter Bunnies,&quot; said Jessica, &quot;I mean, it was fun, but kinda exhausting at the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t allow for much time alone either,&quot; said Roger.<br />
<br />
Jessica looked over at Roger. He was filling out too. He probably won&#39;t be huge, but he was definitely going to be sexy when he reached his prime. Jessica had been feeling the spring fever and she had spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom sating herself. And being next to Roger pushed her to her limits. But she controlled herself, not her instincts. &quot;You wanna see how Bunni and Rockwall are doing?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kinda curious about how they look in their costumes,&quot; said Roger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, then we can get some lunch,&quot; said Jessica. She leaned over and kissed Roger. A heat rose up in her and it took a lot of willpower not to jump her bunny boy&#39;s bones right there. But Jessica was able to pull away and said, &quot;C&#39;mon, it&#39;s a beautiful day to be out.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland had gone to the egg-painting area. There were plenty of small eggs that were easy to dye. There were also big eggs laid by chicken Animalians that had a lot more surface to cover. There were kids who were painting the big eggs, but some older people were doing more detailed art. Some of this art was pretty impressive, even it was only painted on a hard-boiled egg.<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland were also doing some painting. Sophie had been painting a flock of birds on one egg, but somewhere along the line, they became pterodactyls. Sophie soon went back and started repainting the birds into pterodactyls. She looked at her artwork for a while before saying to Roland, &quot;You know, I&#39;m going to lay eggs one day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; snapped Roland, &quot;You can&#39;t be! Oh, my parents are going to be so ticked. I don&#39;t even know how your parents are going to react. How could this have happened? We were so careful...&quot; He paused and said, &quot;Wait, we haven&#39;t had-&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie reached over and flicked Roland&#39;s beak. &quot;I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m expecting eggs now,&quot; she said, &quot;I mean someday I&#39;ll be laying eggs. Maybe ones as big as these.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Roland, a little embarrassed by his jump to conclusions, &quot;How different do you expect that to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I really compare?&quot; asked Sophie, &quot;I was never pregnant the normal way. All I&#39;ve heard is that laying an egg is easier than live birth. I&#39;d only spend three or four months with the eggs inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...that&#39;s not gonna happen for a long time, right?&quot; asked Roland.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; said Sophie, &quot;I&#39;m just thinking about the future a little. Nobody&#39;s getting pregnant any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about that?&quot; Sophie and Roland looked over to see Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pauline, you&#39;re not saying you&#39;re-&quot; started Roland.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m not,&quot; said Pauline, &quot;But I&#39;m wondering why I have to wait for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re still in high school for starters,&quot; said Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that part,&quot; said Pauline, &quot;But why can&#39;t me and JC have our eggs after we graduate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;d have to get married after college,&quot; said Roland.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we? Why even go to college? Me and JC are just going to move down to Vilcabamba, aren&#39;t we?&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so soon?&quot; asked Sophie. She knew the two <i>Microraptor</i> Animalians did love the arboreal village at Vilcabamba where they were able to move through the trees easier than they could walk on the ground. They&#39;ve gotten a lot better since their uplifting/devolution, but they&#39;re clearly built for living in trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after graduation, but why wait longer? What good would a college degree do us down there. It&#39;s mostly jungle anyways,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pauline, Vilcabamba might be mostly jungle, but it&#39;s still an Animalian colony, which there will be business and business will require money,&quot; said Sophie, &quot;You two would have to have some kind of jobs if you move there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the best jobs are available if you have a college degree,&quot; said Roland, &quot;I don&#39;t think you would want the menial jobs down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what kind of degree could possibly benefit me?&quot; asked Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll working something out,&quot; said Sophie, &quot;Just don&#39;t be rash and move as soon as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pauline sighed and said, &quot;Fine, but I don&#39;t want to kick my heels at college for no reason when I could be living in the rainforest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie gave a small sigh of relief. Part of her knew that JC would have to &#39;leave the nest&#39; at some point, but she wasn&#39;t quite ready for that. Maybe that was why she had been thinking of her own eggs. But at least Sophie had time to think things over more thoroughly.</p>
