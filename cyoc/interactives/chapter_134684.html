<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was rushing, through the endless corridors, to find stuff for Mary. He knew that if he didn&#39;t find clothes, or equipment, Mary would question herself about why she was here, and more importantly, she would question herself. James didn&#39;t want that to happen, this was the first time that he had tested the nanobots on a human subject, the first time that a full change of body and mind had happened to a human, the first nurse that he had &quot;recruited&quot; into his &quot;hospital&quot;. James didn&#39;t want Mary to realise who she was, or had been. After going through the endless corridors, he found the door marked &quot;UNIFORMS&quot;. Perfect starting point to find stuff for Mary. He unlocked the door and opened it. Rows and rows of uniforms surrounded the room, all in clear plastic tubs, labelled with animal names just in case this experiment succeeded. James smiled slightly on his exhausted face, he finally had use of this room, but he had to find Mary a uniform and fast. He searched the fronts of every box, trying to find the one labelled &quot;Kangaroo&quot; in the pile of boxed uniforms. James made a note to himself, alphabetise the boxes so it makes finding uniforms easier. In between the box labelled &quot;Geckos&quot; and &quot;Reindeer&quot;, he found it, the box of kangaroo nurse uniforms. He opened the box, the smell of freshly cleaned uniforms filled up his nose, leaving him with a face of satisfaction. He had finally did it, he found the box, and more importantly, he had a nurse to wear it. He grabbed as much of the uniforms as he could, and ran out the door, slamming it shut, making sure he didn&#39;t accidentally lock his keys in the room. He ran back through the corridors until a thought popped into his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I&#39;ll get her things&quot; the thought entered James&#39; head.<br />
<br />
James wanted to scream. &quot;Of course, you HAD to SAY THAT, didn&#39;t you?!&quot; James shouted to himself. He didn&#39;t know what to do. Where was he going to get it? &quot;Wait&quot; he thought &quot;How did she arrive? By car, right?&quot;. He ran through several more corridors to the entrance of the building. Before stepping out, he wanted to know if Jess had a car. He opened the front door slightly, just to peek in and see if she had, at least, some sort of transport. He looked out. A battered old car laid outside the front of the building. This was James&#39; lucky day, but before he could open the car, he needed some way of opening it. Luckily, James knew his way around lock-picking, something he did during his late teenage years. He looked around and found two metal wires on a table near the back of the room. He attempts to pick it up with the pile of kangaroo nurse uniforms in his hands, just managing to grab them while not dropping a single uniform, and runs outside without making a sound. <br />
<br />
The sun is beating down, it&#39;s far warmer than it should be, but James had to get something out of that car. James put the uniforms on the top of the car, making it easier to unlock the car. Sweat was already beating down his forehead, as he struggled to open this old battered car. His hands were shaking, but after a while, he unlocked the car door. The door opened without any siren or security problems, considering it was an older model, battered and poor, it seemed like a no-brainer that the security would be broken in this car. James searched the car for anything that could be given to Mary and still keep her changed personality. He opened the glove compartment. He found some Polaroids of her and her female friends. He would have to alter the image severely to change Jess into Mary and her friends into Mark and Jenny. &quot;Right, something else&quot; James said to himself as she searches for anything else to give to Mary. Behind the driver&#39;s seat was a backpack, usually the type to bring on camps. Perfect. James searched through the bag to find anything, and luckily he found a couple of things. Some clothes, a toiletries bag filled with a toothbrush, leftover toothpaste, deodorant, perfume, and tissues, a couple of magazines, just a few things that was perfect for giving to Mary. James stuffed the photos into the bag, zipped it back up and pulled it out of the car. He unlocked the boot of the car. Inside was more clothes, towels and bags left over from whatever camp she (and it looked like her friends as well) went too. James grabbed the bags and the uniforms, slammed the car doors and ran back inside. <br />
<br />
James ran through the first corridor, and as he turned to the second, he saw someone standing in the middle of the corridor.<br />
<br />
Mary.<br />
<br />
James stopped dead in his path. A million thoughts of panic runs through his head, but one thought continued to flash in his mind. &quot;Well, this is it&quot; James thought &quot;She is bound to find out now&quot;. However, Mary just seemed to be confused. &quot;Woah, you must be in a hurry&quot; Mary said. &quot;Uh- Y- yeah, I&#39;m just...&quot; James said in a shy whisper &quot;I&#39;ve got your uniform, I just have to...&quot;. &quot;Oh, oh, thank you&quot; Mary said &quot;I was just wondering...&quot;. This was it, it would be all over for James. &quot;...where are the toilets?&quot; Mary asked. James sighed in relief. &quot;Down the third corridor on the right is the toilets, I hope that&#39;s okay&quot; James replied, with the smile returning on his face &quot;Now, I have to put these bags through a security check if that&#39;s okay&quot;. Mary nodded &quot;Whatever you have to do, that&#39;s fine&quot;. James smiled as he saw Mary hop towards the third corridor. <br />
<br />
James opened the door to his &quot;office&quot;, dropping the bags and searching through them, trying to find any of the photos with Jess and her friends. He scanned all the photos, running them through a computer program. The program re-scanned the photos. A screen popped up, asking what to change with the photos. The nanobots that were inside the needle installed themselves into the computer, having the ability to change the image. James entered what needed to change: Jess had to be changed to look like a younger Mary, one of her friends had to look like a fennec fox and the other had to change into a male. He pressed enter, and the image began to pulsate and pixelate. The image started to change. The young female on the left side of the first photo, her facial features started to look more masculine, she looked like she started to grow some facial hair, her long hair started to shorten and turned from blonde to a more blackish/brownish colour. The other girl started to look different too. She also looked like she was growing facial hair, but as the program continued to change the photo, it looked less like hair and more like fur surrounded her whole body. Her jaw extended into a muzzle, her teeth became more animal-like, her ears began to shift upwards and became pointed. As the image continued to change, Jess&#39; friends started to actually look like what James wrote down. Finally, since the nanobots knew what Mary looked like, the change to make Mary looked younger was easy. Mary&#39;s kangaroo appearance shrinked slightly to match the height of Mark and Jenny, her muzzle was a lot shorter compared to what she looked like now, her feet were shorter, her ears were slightly shorter, her tail was thinner and shorter. The program stopped the pulsating and pixelating the image and refined the image back to it&#39;s original state with the changes implanted. All the images changed, Jess looked like a young Mary, and her friends changed into Mark and Jenny. All the images were printed on photo paper. James picked up all the original photos, and put them through a shredder. <br />
<br />
James was exhausted. He put his head against the wall and slid to the ground, and from there, he passed out for a bit and slept.</p>
