<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had passed two toon Weeks since Carrie and John turned into Stripey and Rosie. They discovered that time on ToonWorld runs slowly than in 'real world': 6 days on ToonWorld were even with 1 day on 'real world'. They had learnt the basics about being toons, and are more adjusted with their exchanged roles as husband and wife. They learnt also how to hide their stink, knotting their skunk tails. They also learnt how to control how much stink could be exuded when their tails were not knotted, reducing to the minimum their stink. They had gone around all days with Flappy, Hunny, Don and Camille, and even had Fallen Down all together, jumping into the way of a steamroller, and running again into the FDT.<br />
<br />
But ToonWorld isn't just fun.<br />
<br />
It was in the day ZipZap said their toon papers and bank accounts were ready:<br />
<br />
&quot;I just need you two came here in the Transformation &amp; Registration Center for some bureaucracy. Just some red tape and you'll be official toons. We can also perm Stripey as toon.&quot;  said ZipZap by phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about our families on 'real world'? How they deal with this?&quot; Said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were a little shocked, specially yours. But after first impression, they reacted well. They even said they want came here visiting as soon you're okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we need some time to settle down and maybe we could receive them. Well, our friends Don, Camille and Flappy wants to go around to the Dick Dastardly's Flying Circus with the Vulture Squadron. Looks like fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing: this show worths the tickets. Dick Dastardly was turned a real showman, now that all 'stop that pigeon' thing turned a friendly competition. And they have a Fall Down Time for those who wants to experiment a parachute diving without parachute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'll talk them so we go there, take our documents and went to show.&quot;<br />
<br />
They agreed with Rosie's idea and they decided to wait for Rosie and Stripey registration as toons. The two skunks knotted neatly their tails and put some accessories: Stripey a red bowtie, Rosie a neat lady hat. They also gone alone.<br />
<br />
And then that happened:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, cutie! You're wasting time with this sissy knotted skunk. Ditch him and have real fun with Dopey here.&quot; said another skunk, that had an unknotted tail, with a rank stink, strong even for skunk standards, mixed with the smell of cheap tobacco and low profile brandy. He used a bowler and he had a snooker club on hands and a smelly cigar on his sneered mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's my wife, sir.&quot; said Stripey &quot;And I'll not let hoi-polloi like you mess with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Dopey skunk laughed defiantly and sneered:<br />
<br />
&quot;The sissy skunk speaks high, nah? Think can mess with Dopey, nah, sissy skunk? Well, guys, maybe sissy guy's nuts could works better with an anvil over his head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before they could make anything, Stripey was hit directly over his head by an anvil sent from the roof of the snooker club, Falling Down. Rosie tried to scream, but the mean skunk taken her from back, one hand on her muzzle, covering her mouth, the other handling a knife on her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, cutie. I know you're green on toon. This beauty here wouldn't kill you, but you would Fall Down for some hours, and still I would have what I want... But your sissy skunk there wouldn't be that lucky. Come with me.&quot; said the ruffian skunk, as Rosie muffed a scream for help, being pushed through a corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rosie! ROSIE!! ROSIE!!!!! HELP! HELP!&quot; said Stripey, under the anvil. He screamed and screamed and screamed until...<br />
<br />
&quot;Herr Stripey, vot happened?&quot; said a German accented voice. He felt the anvil being taken away from him and a schnauzer dog over her hind legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geoff! God bliss you! A Dopey skunk had taken Rosie after made me Fall Down...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dopey, you said? That's no good. He's a toon raper and some people fink he has thinner smuggled from 'real world'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thinner?&quot; said Stripey horrified. Thinner is one of the few things that could REALLY KILL a toon. &quot;My god, Rosie's in danger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll warn Flappy. He can fly and found Rosie. Don and Camille can help us also.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
After being pushed by some streets, Rosie was launched against a dead end's wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, cutie, I believe you understood why here? The garbage here will hide your smell so we can have some time for adult fun... And don't think you can escape now.&quot; said Dopey, sneering. Together with him was a big bulldog, a bobcat with a no friends face and a rat. The rat taken her lady hat and sent it aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I want to make a thing very clearly: NO FUNNY MOVES! I'm serious about that. I'm not playing when I said I'll have what I wanted. Snacks, show him.&quot; said the skunk.<br />
<br />
The rat put some gloves on her three fingered hands. She noted the gloves were not cartoony: it was real rubber. Then he taken a small vial and opened it. All the things were &quot;real ones&quot;, not &quot;toony&quot;. And then, he dropped a few drops of a incolor liquid on her hat.<br />
<br />
The hat, &quot;toony&quot;, had dissolved in with a BLOOP in a sickly colored blob that disappeared real fast, some rags remaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Thinner!&quot; said Rosie, fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, cutie! Thinner!&quot; said Dopey &quot;Now, if you give me what you want&quot; said him, touching her tail &quot;nothing bad will happen. Be a good girl and you be unharmed. Now, if you mess with me, we can take away your tail with that thinner at first... Do you believe that sissy skunk'll love you without your stink? Even a sissy skunk like him like a stink. But,&quot; he said, unknotting her tail with lust &quot;why lose a soooo beautiful tail. &quot; He finished and sniffed lustful from the beginning of the tail &quot;And that stink! Guy, you drive me crazy, cutie. Your stink is really hot and drives me so horny!&quot; said him, showing his mast &quot;Now... Cutie... You're smart. You know what I want, and you want too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rosie was fearfully, but she tried to think... And noted that she could play his game against him:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my... You're so...&quot; said she, making her stink explode, shooting all of her skunk musk as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, f$#k!&quot; said Dopey, feeling over his face Rosie's stink &quot;Yes! Don't stop! These other guys has no scent sense. You can stink all his way to hell if you want. I want this! I want to feel your stink before f%$k you!&quot; said Dopey, lost in his lust, scrubbing her tail against his face and passing his hands over her tail. It was so gross, so... Rosie could not describe. She know what he wanted now: he wanted to rape her. He was lusting himself on her smell and in the touch of her silken tail fur for minutes. It was gross. It was inveding. She was sick of that disgusting skunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus! Stripey, help me!&quot; she thought, when.<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP THIS!&quot; said a woman voice. Rosie looked for the dead end entrance, when Dopey put that knife again against her throat.<br />
<br />
She saw them: Geoff, the schnauzer; Tom, the Happy Scarecrow; Don and Camille; Flappy. the flying squirrel; Hunny, the bear; and her loved, Stripey the Skunk. They had stopped the henchmen to escape. Camille, dressed as Mary Poppins that time, had used her parasol to take the bobcat by his neck. He had his neck pulled by her and Fell Down in the process. The dog tried to butcher Tom with his knife. Not a good idea: the straw in the Scarecrow made him almost invulnerable against blades. Worse, this had gave Geoff time to resolve things dog to dog. The bulldog had Fell Down on the corner after some punches from Geoff. The rat was pinned down by Hunny when he stepped into his tail. He tried to use thinner against Hunny. Bad idea: he pulled his foot off the danger, and his tail was burnt into oblivion by the thinner. The pain was so great he Fell Down in process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you... Ah, sissy skunk's friends!&quot;  said Dopey. &quot;Well, do you want her back? Take this so!&quot; He pulled Rosie's tail and pointed it to her friends and forced her to shoot them with stinks.<br />
<br />
Not that this works.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moron.&quot; said Hunny &quot;Do you think Rosie's stink could affect us here? There's so much stink here that a little more don't make difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then Stripey see the partially destroyed Rosie's lady hat. He made the association. And had seen red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do... you... have menaced... my wife... WITH THINNER??!?!?!?!&quot; - said Stripey, passing by a Jackyll/Hyde transformation: his pawns showing his claws, his fur turning more bestially, primitive, unscrubbed and big and dirty, his teeth growing and showing over his lips, his body turns bigger and more muscular. He growls in rage and beats his front paws against his chest like King Kong. &quot;ME KILL YOU! ME KILL YOU NOW!&quot; he growled in anger.<br />
<br />
Dopey dropped Rosie aside and gone with his knife to the monster Stripey. He had stabbed him two times, but it was like stabbing a scarecrow. Stripey taken the knife and sent it away after these stabbing. &quot;YOU STAB ME! YOU HURT ROSIE! YOU DIE!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dopey starts to tremble in fear: that guy was a bad sport! &quot;Hee... calm down, chap... It's just... You understand... nah?&quot; she mimbled in fear.<br />
<br />
Stripey catched that guy by his tail and stars to smash it against the floor, pushing it over his head like a whip, smashing in a side and back to the another on an arc, like Jerry made sometimes with Tom the Cat. He also lauched her against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, dear!&quot; said Rosie, hugging the monster Stripey &quot;I'm okay now. We need to give him to police.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
When Stripey looked him, he smelled her stink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ro... sie...&quot; said the monster Stripey, as he shrinked back to his normal toon form as he felt Rosie's safe by her stink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, Stripey.&quot; said Don, as Camille taken Rosie tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Camille, you're without a mask!&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry. Here has so much litter and garbage that the your stink is nothing compared.&quot; said Camille. Than she pushed a brush from her carpet bag and hummered &quot;Spoonful of Sugar&quot; from Mary Poppins film as she scrubbed Rosie tail and fur, as Rosie was calming herself. She was sobbing about the tension she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dey ar' dat, mista Politzei!&quot; said Geoff, pointing all them. Some cops came into the dead end, commanded by a bulldog, as big and bold as a Bulldog Police could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great Scott! It's really Dopey from the Docks!&quot;, said the bulldog<br />
<br />
&quot;He and that guys tried to rape my friend's wife.&quot; said Don &quot;And I think they are smuggling thinner to ToonWorld.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thinner? You say, THAT thinner? Real World one?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; chirped Flappy &quot;Looked at her hat... but don't touch it directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave it to me.&quot; a beaver with a kevlar vest identifying him as &quot;ToonWorld CSI&quot; came and taken a real pair of pincers. Using them he take what remained from Rosie's lady hat and looked at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Utterly destroyed! And that awful smell!&quot; said the beaver &quot;Surely, sir. It was real thinner. No doubt sir.&quot; He taken the CB on her waist and switched it on &quot;We have a Code 2 situation here: RW thinner contamination, We need the evidence extraction equipment Mark II. Copy that, Smarty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger, Kiddy, You're on alley? Boss with you, copy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger, Smarty. Boss's here. Who needs know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ZipZap from the Transformation &amp; Registration Center.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ZipZap friends?&quot; said the bulldog<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; said Stripey, as he calm himself down to speak, as Rosie was so in shock that she almost could not react to Camille scrubbing her tail. &quot;She conducted my transformation on skunk male and her transformation also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're perm or temp?&quot; said the bulldog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Commander Budgers, sir.&quot; said the bulldog<br />
<br />
&quot;Budgers... Firstly she was to be a bunny female. But she was a human male when we came to ToonWorld in honeymoon. When ZipZap said we could break up as I'm a skunk, he plead her to turn her in a skunk also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So she's perm and you're temp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I'm going to perm myself also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. And...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are going to the TRC take our documents and having some red tape to register ourselves as toons. Then, this ruffian came and Fell me Down with an anvil and abducted Rosie from me. Geoff here taken the anvil out and helped me to a Heal-o-matic. In meantime, Flappy, Don and Camille came to rescue. Flappy flewn over the city, looking for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I smelled her over here.&quot; said Flappy. &quot;I think he was trying to seduce her and rape her. Her knot was undone, I see it. And then she expelled as much stink as she could. Even over the buildings I could feel a afterscent of her stink. As I know two skunks don't have the same stink, I could say it was her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then Flappy called us by cellphone.&quot; said Don &quot;We ran to here and in the way we found either Hunny and Tom, They helped us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The first one we Fell Down was that bobcat,&quot; said Camille &quot;I pulled it to me with my parasol hook and pulled her neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Than that dull bulldog tried to stab my with his knife.&quot; said Tom &quot;As you could stab a scarecrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dis gif me time to gif him a one-two an' Fell him Down.&quot; said Geoff &quot;And I went to call you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In meanwhile, that rat&quot; said Hunny &quot;tried to run and I pinned her tail down under my foot. Then he tried to hurt me with thinner and had the worse: I lifted my leg and the thinner spilled over her tail, destroying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then... Well, it was a little frightening, but Stripey go havok when he discovered Dopey harrased Rosie with thinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don't need to say that it was a little exarcebated from you, but it's okay.&quot; said Budgers going out, &quot;So... I need you all tomorrow on my office. 8pm. Just formalities and red tape. I know ZipZap wants you be registered today, so I'll dismiss you for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Commander Budgers.&quot; said Stripey.<br />
<br />
This moment, Camille had finished grooming Rosie's tail and release her, that ran into Stripey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stripey... It... It was... He tried... Tried to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, Rosie... It's over.&quot; said Stripey. &quot;I'm here. I'm here and you can believe I'll make you safe from harming and from this ruffians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I'm so...&quot; said Rosie &quot;And I'm stinking... He undone my knot! I can't go today! No... I'll not misbehave. ZipZap'll not SDP again the TRC.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, Rosie.&quot; said Camille, stroking lightly her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Camille, you hand'll stank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'll wash it after,&quot; said Camille, very Mary Poppins-ish. &quot;But now, we need to knot your tail back. Spit spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, Rosie sitted on Camille's lap like a very small child that needed to be groomed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is good. Now, stay calm and off we go.&quot; said Camille, knotting Rosie's tail with a almost supernatural skill and callousness, as Rosie stink was being exuding because her fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; said Kiddy, the CSI. &quot;Stay quiet. I'll take a stink remover we use in camp.&quot; He ZIPed out and in back with a spray can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, everyone stay here, you too, ms. Rosie. Even with a knotted tail you had exuded so much stink that your tail is impregnated. Okay... 3... 2... 1...&quot;<br />
<br />
They felt the liquid hitting him. The smell was like cryoline and alcohol.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just stay some seconds on wind and the smell'll gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille smelt herself some and noted that the stink'd gone, but his perfume also.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that. This is a Smell Neutralizer we use in crime scenes. It removes every smell where it hit, good or bad. The Smell Neutralizer is very useful on scene, but as he remove every smell, it's not a thing to use normally against people.&quot; said Kiddy<br />
<br />
&quot;I understood. Oh, well.&quot; again, very Mery Poppins-ish, Camille taken a small blush powder from his bag and corrected his face. &quot;Now I'm ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think now you're ready to register as toon. It's some red tape and so on, but nothing to worry about. It's very simple. Well, good luck then.&quot; said Kiddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one thing before we go.&quot; said Rosie<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Rosie, you shouldn't stay so much here. This will make bad memories for you.&quot; replied Budgers<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be worse if I don't speak out what need now.&quot; said Rosie &quot;Well, that Dopey skunk said, when he putted his knife on my throat, 'This beauty here wouldn't kill you, but you would Fall Down for some hours, and still I would have what I want...'. What he was meaning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I see you're a little green on toon, but not that much. Okay: some bad guys do what we call the Fall Down Crimes. Basically, it's the process of commiting a crime by Fall Down the victim, rendering it helpless, and then act the crime itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... Oh my god! I made a crime! I sprayed stink on Camille when she asked for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You robbed or hurted him after making miss DeMarco Falling Down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don't have anything to worry about. You see: ToonWorld is a touristic world, and some guys came here to experience a toon life. And a toon life includes Fall Down. In some way, you made even a favor for Camille, as she now knows how much a skunk can stink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know about this.&quot; said Camille &quot;My husband is a FDTnaut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's one of those nuts?&quot; said Budgers, smiling &quot;Well, although this looks strange, helping people Fall Downs it's not illegal. We even have professionals in provoking Fall Down in inventive ways. It's bizarre, but not illegal. The only crime with Fall Down it's provoking a Mega Fall Down on a 100% pure human, like you, miss DeMarco. A toonified human can be Mega Fall Down normally and he recover himself as any other toon, with a Heal-O-Matic. But,&quot; continued Budgers &quot;some guys abuse on the Fall Down to rob tourists and rape and so on. On these cases, the guys are persecuted and judged and condemnt as normal, with a extra degree, as we consider Fall Down a way to render people helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... If we are okay... Remember, ms. Rosie: I want you and your friends as witness today, 8am, on my office. And now, why not goes and see ZipZap and start your official life?&quot;</p>
