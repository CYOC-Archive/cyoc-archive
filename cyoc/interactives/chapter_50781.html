<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday morning came with a feeling of tranquility and confidence for Jensen in the master bedroom. The pack's wolf-hood was permanently theirs and could never be taken away. They would prosper and their pack would grow. Although, soon its growth would be determined by nature and not the game. He smiled down at his mates in the bed with him. Kaylee and Julie lay to his right. Fran and Darla to his left. All of them smiling in their sleep.<br />
<br />
All of them were beautiful, just as he thought himself to be handsome now. He suddenly found himself wondering what his future children would look like. Of curse he could guess, using Bart, Jenny, Kevin, Marcy, Alice, Abbey, and Samantha as references, but they were only his children because of the Game. But he still found himself loving them. They were his children, his future. He would do anything to protect them. And while Kaylee didn't entirely realize it for the moment, Jensen was certain that Kaylee felt the same way about the pups.<br />
<br />
She had had the rabbit that Kevin had caught skinned and cooked to kill any possible parasites that might make the younger male pup sick. She scolded Martha, Mr. P, Jenny, and Marcy for Marcy's handstand stunt the way any protective mother would. Just as Jensen found himself embracing parental responsibility, Kaylee was developing maternal instincts.<br />
<br />
All of that, however, didn't change who Jensen was. He was the Big Bad Wolf, after all, but it was logical that he wasn't &quot;bad&quot; to his own kind. After all, if he was, he'd end up destroying his own Pack, which he had worked so hard to build. And since Serenity wasn't a witch, Jensen intended to show her how big and bad he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Master,&quot; Kaylee said softly from beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Kaylee,&quot; Jensen replied to his mate, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Kaylee smiled, &quot;YOU were there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen only smiled back as the triplets began to stir, in unison of course.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Mr. P was jostled awake but something furry landing on his back.  He had slept calmly on the floor  of the pup's room. Fearing one of the pups had fallen out of bed he raised his head to check. To his surprise it was Chester. The small dog looked nervously at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go to the bathroom,&quot; Chester barked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So go,&quot; Mr. P answered, wondering how the dog, who had always been a dog knew how to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Mr. P could still use the toilet, but much of that was due to his greater size, which allow to position himself so that he could do his business and dispose of it without making a mess in the house. Nevertheless, it was still quite a sight to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can not reach the door, and I can not turn the... the... the ball on it,&quot; Chester told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pack removed all the interior doors,&quot; Mr. P told the dog, &quot;You should be able to walk right in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not the human bathroom that they use, but the dog bathroom,&quot; Chester explained, &quot;Master always took me for walks and followed with plastic bags. I was never sure why, but Master always had them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's just say that Fran or Julie were being sanitary when they took you for walks,&quot; Mr. P answered as he got up, letting Chester fall to the ground below him, &quot;I will see if Martha is up. She will let you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to be in an awful hurry,&quot; Margot commented with a yawn in the female's den as she leaned over Lawrence's sleeping body.<br />
<br />
Caroline pawed her hair down with her paws to make sure nothing was out of place and she was as presentable as a naked she-wolf could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;The foreman and the day workers will be back today to finish installing the new gate,&quot; Caroline answered, &quot;I need to be ready so that they don't go wandering where they shouldn't or accidentally send the new gate crashing into one of the gargoyles or the wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're teasing him, aren't you?&quot; Margot replied, &quot;You naughty girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not,&quot; Caroline protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you wish to add them to the pack?&quot; Margot replied, &quot;was Lawrence not good enough for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lawrence was...&quot; Caroline found herself smiling at the previous night's activities, &quot;Lawrence was AMAZING. But that isn't the point. Besides, it'd be a reward for all their hard work. I know they were all checking me out yesterday... might as well give them first hand experience with wolf-hood. And we wouldn't have to pay any money to the company. Once their old lives are forgotten, the money would cycle back TOO the estate anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Margot shrugged. Mostly, she was teasing the pack's &quot;fore-wolf&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there is what Mr. P said about us needing more wolves to survive short term,&quot; Caroline added, and then shuddered at the prospect of the pack dying because of a lack of unrelated mates, &quot;We can't do that. We must live... and the new wolves wouldn't directly put any strain on the manor. They'd start by preparing the island for habitation should we ever have to relocate there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Margot found herself shuddering at that prospect. It sort of made her wish that the Master had approved Lawrence's idea. If they could transform into some semi-divine wolf gods that could transform others into wolf-people by mere interaction, they'd never have to hide, and the not only Glendale would become their hunting ground, but all the world.<br />
<br />
But then, such a thing could be risky if they just used the game willy-nilly. Zack had been a problem initially because of the Game's twisting interpretation of the &quot;transform&quot; Alexandra had given to the click and Zack. And that was to be a rather simple transform. Becoming semi-divine would have been far more tricky. With that, Margot decided the Master had made a wise choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only times they'd be here would be to eat and sleep, and Alice, or Abbey, or Samantha, or all three of them could do that easily,&quot; Caroline continued, &quot;In case you feel threatened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not threatened,&quot; Margot answered and got up, &quot;I was only teasing a bit. Do you think the Master will approve of your request?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He approved yours to upgrade Lawrence and Roger,&quot; Caroline shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that we're complaining,&quot; Margot smiled, &quot;come on, we'd better get ready for breakfast if the workman are going to be back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee quietly made their way into the dining room to find the Pack waiting for them and a large slab of meat laying on the floor for all of them to eat. The triplets were with their glass pups, with Samantha holding Chester, who had done his business and came back in. He surveyed the packs numbers as he motioned for everyone to begin eating. They had well over thirty wolves. Perfectly capable of defending the pack against most things.<br />
<br />
But then he remembered what Mr. P had said the night before. A population needed at least fifty members to survive short term, and the Big Bad Wolf Pack with four females to every male would likely need even more then that. Jensen had wanted to stop using the game for creating new wolves with Julie, but he also had to insure his race would live on. He didn't know if they could interbreed with humans, but he was tempted to ignore that option, as a half-wolf wouldn't be pure.<br />
<br />
There was also the possibility that if they were in fact &quot;werewolves&quot; they only needed to bite or scratch someone to spread their condition... but then Marcine didn't become a she-wolf when Marcy bit her, so he guessed that that was out. The only way the Pack could grow was through the Game, and as Alpha Male, Jensen had a responsibility to insure the Pack lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caroline,&quot; he said in a calm voice.<br />
<br />
The dark blue she-wolf looked up from where she was eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may bring the foreman and the day workers into the Pack,&quot; Jensen told her, &quot;Remember that their previous lives are to be erased from the memories of anyone who knew them. We are also to keep to our current ratio. Four females for every male. If the numbers are such that we have left overs, write them down so when we add more at some other date, we can insure that the gender ratio is maintained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; Caroline nodded.</p>
