<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wright pushed Todd from the deck, causing Todd to fall on the cement leading to the house.  He didn&#39;t get up, his body wracking with sensations he had never felt before.  &quot;You should take off those pants before you get into a world of hurt, boy.&quot;  Wright began to smile once more, but Todd was too busy writhing in pain and fumbling with his pants to issue a proper statement.  His intestines seemed to bloat outward, straining against the muscle of his stomach.  He could feel a burning sensation from his rear, and realized his spine was elongating. The exact order of what grew first confounded Todd&#39;s mind, but the pain caused him to put his hand in his mouth and bit down.  He focused on the pain to ignore the transformation, but it only lasted until even the agony in his hand subsided.<br />
<br />
Todd became acutely aware of the wind as it blew through his fur, which covered the entirety of his body.  He gazed at his hands.  The ends of his digits had blackened into three thick nails: two extremely thick fingers and a thumb.  He looked at his arms, which were notably thinner than they once were, and was briefly confused by the pattern of black and white in the fur.<br />
<br />
He felt the massive size of his lower half, but refused to look back.  He only knew of one animal that would have this coat color.  He met eyes with Marty, and knew he had to get up and deal with it.  Rising from the ground, Todd lifted the unwieldy mass that was now his only means of movement.  Looking down and back, he was greeted by the sight of a prodigiously large bovine, which he was connected to at his stomach.  He stood slightly taller than Marty, but Marty was undoubtedly wider than he.<br />
<br />
With a few shaky steps forward, he noticed the pendulous swing of something on his lower half.  Hopeful, he twisted to get a closer look at what was between his hind legs, but was greeted by a huge udder.  Even though his cow-half was large, if Todd slouched in the slightest, he could feel the udder&#39;s teats brush the ground beneath him.<br />
<br />
Or was he now a her?  Bulls don&#39;t have udders and he clearly didn&#39;t have any male genitals.  His upper half still looked masculine enough, apart from the facial modifications he could feel.  His nose had flattened, and though it was not a snout, it was definitely wider than his previous one.  His ears were higher on his head and he could feel the nubs of horns through the thinner layer of fur.  With another step to solidify his stance, the udder jiggled viciously, and he could feel its weight, and more importantly, the fluid inside.<br />
<br />
He haphazardly twisted back to Wright.  &quot;What the hell did you do to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I should&#39;ve mentioned what my curse does, exactly.  I don&#39;t choose what you become so much as the magic reforms you to express what I think of you.  Spider-boy back there was because the first word that came to my mind was &#39;spineless.&#39;  He turned into a bug, and guess what those don&#39;t have?&quot;  He pointed to Jamie.  &quot;That fathead was supposed to get a different pill, but since he slept at the wrong house he became a copperhead.&quot;  Pointing back to Todd, his grin returns.  &quot;And you were Mister Big-dick, the head honcho with balls to spare.  You took the right pill at first and saw what happened, but this pill picked the critter with the biggest package you could get hanging between your legs: a cow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd gave him a confused look, so Wright spoke up once more.  &quot;Long story short, the pills transformed you, but it was based on my perspective, the result is something neither the pills nor I decide.  It keeps me from getting backlash from demanding too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care about your stories, what am I going to do about this thing?!&quot;  He pointed to the hefty udder barely concealed by his hind legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you&#39;ll get it milked often?  The magic of the curse will keep it nice and large, though it&#39;s not going to instantly refill that sucker.  But if I had to guess, you&#39;ll probably want a milker or a really patient person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s bullshit, old man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s proper punishment for trying to be a punk in front of me twice.  I left you all with each other and a fair semblance of life, and that&#39;s the most you can ask for from me.  God help you if I catch you trying to &#39;prank&#39; me again.  Now get off my lawn.&quot;</p>
