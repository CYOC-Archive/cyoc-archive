<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gang all saw the encampment and with joy ran quickly to greet their comrades and friends. It was Daphne that first stopped at the professor's tent and peering inside saw a drunken man laying sprawled out and sleeping his troubles away.<br />
<br />
Freddie went from empty tent to empty tent and looking around he wondered where everybody had gone. Jarett being already half trained in police work checked out the piles of torn and shed clothing which littered the camp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody is here, not even their Porters!&quot; said Daphne.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were here, their clothes and belongings still remain as if everybody just walked off into the jungle?&quot; grumbled Freddie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, over here!&quot; called Jarett.<br />
<br />
The gang all headed his way and with care and caution Jarett opened a tent flap. There laying together as if hugging when they fell asleep was Janice and Marge Belden. The college was against the two of them both coming on the dig as if something might happen or go wrong.<br />
<br />
Freddie bent down and with a soft touch shook Marge awake.<br />
<br />
The next two hours were to say very little a real eye opener to the gang. Marge and Janice told of the Medallion and it's sensual curse which made several of the students wish to join the animal kingdom and run off. Janice told of her experiance as being one of the animals but she felt lucky getting changed back by the Professor.<br />
<br />
It was Freddie who came here on a mission of mercy for his parents back home. He fell backwards to sit and listen as of his dear Sister's fate. He looked over to Jarett and then back at Marge as Jenny's story unfolded and the final wish she had to remain a male horse at stud.<br />
<br />
In all the comotion Professor Simmons came awake and peered out his tent with blurry vision. Bottle still in hand he sauntered over to the gang as the wild story continued to unfold.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Wilma, Wilma she too begged and schemed to join that herd! I tried to stop her but she took the Medallion while I slept. She's gone too! A big black shaggy nanny goat she is now, how can I explain this to their parents?&quot; groaned a still very drunk Professor Simmons.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, your all drunk!&quot; yelled Freddie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hick, drunk, yes you'd be drunk too if you saw what we saw, you'd be drunk too!&quot; moaned the Professor.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all a bunch of bull shit! I want to know what happened to Jenny, no damn stupid story I want to know for real!&quot; screamed an angery Freddie as the gang looked on with horror and wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not, cough, cough, hick, bull shit and I can prove it too!&quot; said the Professor as Marge walked close to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freddie it's all true, cross my heart it's true! said Marge as her fingers picked the silver Medallion up off the Professor's dirt shirt.<br />
<br />
Freddie walked up to the half hunched over and very drunk Professor. &quot;This silver piece of jewelry changed most everybody to a animal, huh! Well if this has such powers then I would wish to be at my Sister's side and fuck off too!&quot; grumbled Freddie.<br />
<br />
Even as his fist was wrapped around the silver bobble the growing glow of it's powers beamed out making all look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get to see dear Jenny very soon my young foolish one!&quot; said the Professor as he pulled the Medallion from Freddie's grasp.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Freddie must have had some idea of what was to come. Shaking all over he turned to look at Jarett. The gang shrank back as Freddie's face rapidly began to change.<br />
<br />
Screaming for help Freddie stood and watched as waves of darkening ski became covered in sandy blonde hairs. Eyes wild from feelings unexplained he stood there watching as did the gang. Straining his mouth around the change racked his face in pains as teeth fell out and new massive moulders poked in. Snorting his nose grew and merged with a blackened upper lip.<br />
<br />
Freddie reached a hand toward the Professor as if begging it all to stop. A terrible ripping sound announced the expanding growth of hips and thighs becoming all too much equine.<br />
<br />
As pants fell to the ground and a pair of jocky shorts ripped in half the new maleness pressed into the sunlight. Black horse hide covered Freddie and with the sandy blonde hairs growing everywhere except his groin all there seemed enticed to watch his privates.<br />
<br />
It was Daphne that stepped out of the stunned gang and walked directly up to one scared Freddie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice boy, good horsie!&quot; said Daphne.<br />
<br />
Freddie was changing rapidly but his mental abilities were still aware. Daphne's words made him whinny and snort. Yet as she stood there her soft right hand reached out and stroked Freddie's new and extra sensative sheath.<br />
<br />
Wide eyed and looking at Daphne maybe in disgust but feeling strange desires of equine nature his maleness began to fill and rise. Daphne watched and as the massive organ grew she took hold of it in both hands. <br />
<br />
Freddie blinked and stood stiff as his new maleness strained out long and longer than anything he'd ever felt. Daphne continued to urge him on as she stroked him into a state of total bestial madness.<br />
<br />
As if somehow she knew that his change would only increase in speed her touching made the change race on. It was when Freddie who growing ever taller now on hind legs finally leaned his growing weight on Daphne's shoulders.<br />
<br />
Quickly she dropped to her knees and with that Freddie found himself on all fours and feeling his sexual pangs. The gang watched and learned as the growing stallion bounced his massive black cock up and down letting it swing. Daphne still in a trance sat on her knees looking at the big cock moving about in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn Daphne you've always been a whore!&quot; grumbled Jarett.<br />
<br />
A quick look his way and she turned around grabbing Freddie's much bigger cock and with one move jammed it in her mouth. Only seconds passed till the wild urge could be denied by Freddie nolonger. A roar of white cum and chuncky semen globs came out into Dahpne's mouth. A volume few could handle the cum jetted out past her lips as no doubt heavy chunks got swallowed.<br />
<br />
The Professor was at last the one who taking Daphne's arm yanked her away and off the stallion's inflamed organ.<br />
<br />
All looked at one messed up and stinking Daphne. It took only a minute till spitting out the remains of Freddies load she started to cry.<br />
<br />
The Professor motioned Jarett to grab a belt and with it escort the new stallion to meet his sister. As all watched the swaying silky tail on Freddie's big butt head down the trail to his corral they turned to lay down or sit about the camp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry gang, he was changed to a horse and by tomorrow will wish and then be changed back to his normal self!&quot; announced the Professor.<br />
<br />
Jarett opened the corral's gate and released the new blonde and black  tailed stallion to meet his sister. Freddie walked close as Jenny's eyes showed white.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, meet your brother Freddie!&quot; said Jarett.<br />
<br />
As mules brayed their greetings an angry Jenny reared up and dropped like a fury wild beast onto her brother's back. A scramble began and then a fight of stallion against rival stallion for dominance of the herd.<br />
<br />
Bitting, kicking, whirling about hooves flew and screams echoed the canyon's walls. It was after just a few minutes that one blonde and black stallion jumped a four rail fence for safety.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she just said, go away there Freddie!&quot; said Jarett as he tried to calm the young stallion.</p>
