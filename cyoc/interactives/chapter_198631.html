<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The phone rings and both women sigh and get off of Dave. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take care of that quickly Dave. We will waiting for you.&quot; Dave&#39;s boss told him as he hastily dressed himself.<br />
<br />
As Petra sat down in one of the guest chairs with a resigned sigh, pulling out her phone. Dave&#39;s boss Kris sat down behind his desk. She imagined what it would be like to be a man like Dave sitting here. Frowning she saw a piece of paper and golden pen.<br />
<br />
Kris wasn&#39;t sure why Dave was writing down all kinds of obvious things. In fact a few were outright strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any changes made by the pen will only be realized by me unless I state otherwise.&quot; <br />
<br />
It made her want to laugh but she kept reading. Bored with herself she thought she could make a few improvements to the the jokey note. Something that they could laugh about later. Kris was one of the highest-rated superiors in the company, a lot of it was how easily she built rapport with her subordinates, and part of that was her legendary wit.<br />
<br />
There were changes mentioned to his secretary. Kris had to admit was hot but she was so obnoxious. Kris usually scheduled her own appointments but she always delegated to her secretary just to avoid talking to Janet. Looking at Dave&#39;s friend Petra as she scrolled through her phone, one leg bouncing with excess energy, causing her breasts to bounce up in down.<br />
<br />
Petra would be a much better secretary. She quickly wrote it out and laughed. It was pretty funny. Looking up at the attentive Petra she sighed. Petra stood stock still near the door waiting for Dave&#39;s return. Just because they were friends outside of work it didn&#39;t change her dedication to workplace hierarchy. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can head back to your desk if you want and once he gets back join us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Ma&#39;am. I can wait.&quot; Kris had to hand it to Dave he had made an excellent choice. Though there were a few misgivings. They were going to fuck Dave when he got back. There was no doubt. <br />
<br />
She then saw Dave returning with a short, pudgy man with glasses. He wasn&#39;t obese but probably slightly overweight. She quickly recognized him as their head of cyber security. He was very smart, if not annoying with the timing of the &quot;critical&quot; security flaws that had to be patched. In fact, he was one of many foreign hires at their company. His family had immigrated from Israeli when he was young and he still had a bit of an accent.<br />
<br />
Kris took one look down, trying to see if you could jot one more thing. Something that would give Dave a laugh later when he least expected it. She couldn&#39;t find any funny possibilities but she did find one error. <br />
<br />
&quot;Every guest will become young, thin, pretty, and fit. Their clothing would become tight, sexy, and somewhat revealing. Their attitude would become pert, bubbly, slightly horny, and attracted to Dave.&quot; <br />
<br />
Two things stood out as blatantly wrong. Kris was pretty horny right now. Plently low enough that she would have no probably going through a workday and going home to get off. Or if Dave wasn&#39;t busy see if she could swing by for some relief. What was the point of writing down all the bizarre realities of his work life if he wrote it down wrong? Kris scratched out slightly she replaced it with moderate. <br />
<br />
Another thing stood out. Dave&#39;s guests. Petra and Kris were accurately described with the words in front of her except for one more thing. Kris didn&#39;t think of herself as a guest. She prided herself on her ability to keep it fairly casual in the workplace and Dave and she frequently collaborated on projects. Then there was Petra, his secretary. Secretaries weren&#39;t really guests in any imaginable way. She quickly fixed it to anyone in Dave&#39;s office and quickly sat up and stepped away. Best not to reveal the joke too soon. She was happy she caught Dave&#39;s errors for him.<br />
<br />
Dave was frustrated. He was about to have his fantasy play out but got interrupted by work. Then purely by habit he quickly sprinted off to put out the latest fire, only to realize he had forgotten the pen that could have instantly resolved the problem. No matter, now he was back. <br />
<br />
He could write the problem away but this wouldn&#39;t take too long and his favorite part of the job actually was he good he was at putting out the fires. And Chris and Peter were here which would save time as they would need to be there while they workshopped a fix.<br />
<br />
He felt tingles rush down his spine when he re-entered his office. If the two of them had been up to something naughty there was no sign off it now. Peter sat in one of the chairs in his office while Chris leaned on his desk.</p>
