<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leaving the Magic Shop, Gloria and her friends anxiously looked at one another. Whatever the threat was they would meet it head on. Still, how could they possibly face Villar considering what Merlin had told them.<br />
<br />
Cole, Kumiko, Tom and Marjorie Harris now watched as the children approached. &quot;How&#39;d everything go in there,&quot; Cole asked as Gloria and Yuriko approached. &quot;About as well as could be expected,&quot; Gloria shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for giving us a ride dad,&quot; Yuriko interrupted, causing Cole to chuckle. &quot;No problem,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Kind of head no choice when dad decided to wrap the car around that guy.&quot; Tom Harris frowned slightly as he looked the group over. &quot;What would you have me do son,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;He was threatening my grandchildren.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess your grandfather is a bit overprotective in your time huh Yuriko,&quot; Kumiko chuckled. Yuriko forced a smile, nodding at her mothers question. She didnt want to say that Tom Harris had been dead for sometime in her future. While she was unaware of his cause of death, she knew he was both an intimidating and beloved figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now isnt this Interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s eyes went wide in horror as she slowly turned towards the voice. &quot;Villar,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Villar grinned at the group, slowly approaching. &quot;Tell me,&quot; he sneered. &quot;Do you think you have any chance of winning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria said nothing, her and her friend&#39;s now readying themselves for a fight. Villar sensed this, his hands flashing forward as he released a blast of magical energy. The group scattered, bodies laying prone as he simply looked backwards towards the group of Voids behind him. &quot;Take them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole and Tom shook their heads in an attempt to clear their minds. The blast had stunned them but they were now on their feet. As Cole scanned the group he gasped in horror. &quot;Kumiko!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked to where his son ran, seeing his daughter in law bleeding on the ground. Quickly making his way to his son he could see him cradling her in his arms. &quot;Shes unconscious,&quot; Cole said quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What about the baby,&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kumi got hit in the head dad,&quot; Cole said quickly, useing his hands to try and stem her bleeding. &quot;I got to get her out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom said nothing, simply nodding as he turned back towards where the fighting was. Gloria and the others were trying to make a stand. Already he could see the young teens trying to fight off the Voids, blasts of magical energy exploding in every direction. &quot;Cole get your wife and mother out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom what are you doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom gazed down at his wife. Marjorie could see the sad but determined look on her husbands face. Seeing that she realized what he was about to do. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered, her eyes dampening with tears. &quot;No, Tom, no dont do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marjorie,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Tell the children, I&#39;m sorry. But I have to do this, for our grandchildren.&quot; Marjorie reached up for her husband, a soft sob escaping her lips as he turned towards battle. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said as he turned to fight.<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others were shaken but trying to recover as the Voids charged at them. Already Felicia had put up a barrier as Naomi and Sasha tried to counterattack. As Naomi released a blast of energy, Sasha manipulated the walls of a building, turning it into a pillar of stone. Crying out she sent the pillar forward, watching as it pulverized a group of Voids into paste. They had successfully stopped some yet more were rushing forward. Looking at Jackie, Gloria gave her friend a simple nod realizing what they needed to do.<br />
<br />
Gloria and Jackie now stood, focusing their rings on the remaining Voids. As the rings glowed the group watched as they seemed to shudder, almost seeming to have a seizure as the magic washed over them. The once imposing Voids began to shrivel, their muscle shrinking as they began to age. Brittle bones began to crack with age as they let out a death rattle before crumbling to dust. &quot;Jackie we need to stop him.&quot; Jackie nodded as the two teens pointed their rings at Villar.<br />
<br />
Villar smirked as he watched the Voids charge into battle. He had expected to see them fail in battle. The Voids were of no consequence though, they were merely a distraction. He wanted a direct confrontation with the wizards. As Jackie and Gloria pointed their rings at him, stumbled slightly before bursting into maniacal laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Age magic,&quot; he shouted. &quot;Did you REALLY think age magic would affect me!&quot; Villar flashed a sick smile at the two teens as he narrowed his eyes at them. &quot;Let me show you MY age magic!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie and Gloria could feel the color drain from their faces as Villar sent a blast of energy careening towards them. Before the blast could connect, Felicia dove in front attempting to erect a barrier. Villars blast obliterated her shields connecting with the teen who screamed in agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Felicia,&quot; Naomi yelled as she sprinted towards her girlfriend. Jackie and Gloria gaped as they watched Felicia. The dark haired teen writhed in agony as the spell coursed through her body. Gloria watched as Felicia looked up at them, a look of pain on her face.<br />
<br />
Felicia was growing older rapidly, the teens face growing more mature as she rocketed into adulthood. Gloria and Jackie were astounded how quickly she went from teenager to adult in so little time. Still though she grew older. Felicia&#39;s body had swelled into adulthood but now it was beginning again. The raven haired womans breasts appeared to beginning to sag as small lines appeared around her eyes. As Naomi now tried to comfort her girlfriend she was astounded to see her black hair grow duller, grey strands beginning to overtake the midnight black.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening,&quot; Felicia whispered hoarsely as she sped through her 40s and entered her 50s. Naomi said nothing, trying to comfort her ageing girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Felicia gazed at her hands, watching as they thinned, wrinkling and curling as arthritis began to set in. Looking into her girlfriends eyes she screamed in pain as the ravages of age began to take hold. Felicia&#39;s dark hair now faded to grey and was quickly becoming white as she sped onwards. Fifties became sixties which became seventies and onto her eighties. &quot;Help me,&quot; she whispered, her voice frail as her strength and life drained from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria, Jackie,&quot; Naomi exclaimed. &quot;Its not stopping, hes going to kill her. Do something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie now tried to help, racing towards Felicia. &quot;I think not,&quot; Villar snarled flicking his wrist. Jackie flew backwards, hit by an invisible force that sent her crashing through a plate glass window. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Felicia yelled.  Villar paused watching as she and Sasha now tried to attack. A small chuckle escaped Villars lips as the two teens attacked. Sasha useing her ring to animate several statues as Felicia sent a blast of energy in his direction. &quot;Pitiful,&quot; he muttered, swatting Felicia&#39;s blast away as he smashed the statues. Focusing his magic he now knocked Sasha and Felica back effectively stopping the two.<br />
<br />
The distraction though had given Gloria the time she needed. Reaching Diane, she could see she was close to 100 by now. The womans face was gaunt, her eyes almost milky white with thin white hair. Taking Diane&#39;s hand she could see her body was nearly skeletal while her breathing was labored. Focusing her magic into her ring she was able to stop the progression but found trying to reverse it to be a colossal effort. &quot;Watch out,&quot; Naomi screamed.<br />
<br />
Gloria looked up in the nick of time as Villar swept his arm out. Gloria would have been struck down if not for Naomi, the Asian teen powering herself up to intercept the attack. Villar paused as he connected with Naomi, before seizing her by the throat and launching her into a nearby building.<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s eyes grew wide in horror as she quickly looked at her friends. She was the only one left standing. Focusing her magic she now tried to freeze Villar in place. &quot;Good effort,&quot; he growled, struggling to move. &quot;But not good enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Letting out a scream Villar broke through Gloria&#39;s enchantment, seizing her by the head. The teen now began to scream as Villar tightened his grip, intending on crushing Gloria&#39;s skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Yuriko screamed as she appeared from out of nowhere. Focusing her mental energy the future teen now used her magic to knock Villar back. Stunned he looked at the teen as she focused her magic on a mental attack. &quot;Psionics,&quot; he questioned as the girl tried to tear apart his mind. <br />
<br />
Villar grit his teeth as Yuriko continu8her spell. The teen was concentrating with all her might, her nose beginning to bleed as she tried to stop this thing from destroying the people she had known all her life. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get. Out. Of. My. Head!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bringing his fist down, Villar created a shockwave, knocking Yuriko backwards and effectively ending her spell. Dazed the teenager looked up to see a very angry Villar slowly approaching.<br />
<br />
The survivors would recall later how time seemed to slow at this point. Felicia and Gloria watched as Villar approached Yuriko intent on delivering a killing blow. Neither teen was in any condition to do anything and were helpless. Before Villar could attack the teens were shocked as Tom Harris jumped on the back of the behemoth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Felicia, Gloria,&quot; he yelled as he clung to Villara back. &quot;Get everyone out of here.&quot; Gloria tried to move as Tom Harris pointed his pistol into Villars temple, unloading the entire clip into him. After emptying the pistol with little effect he withdrew a knife, repeatedly stabbing Villar in a vain attempt to stop him.<br />
<br />
Villar howled with rage as he tried to shake the old marine off. Finally getting a hold of his leg he swung him downwards. The impact of Tom&#39;s body was sickening as Felicia heard his bones crack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Harris,&quot; Gloria cried as she tried to stand.<br />
<br />
Tom grit his teeth, blood dripping from his mouth as Villar picked him up by the neck. &quot;Tom Harris,&quot; he sneered. &quot;The old soldier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom snarled, taking his knife and stabbing it into Villars forearm. Despite the knife penetrating his arm Villar showed no signs of pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;A warrior like you deserves a heros death,&quot; Villar smirked. &quot;Let me give you that honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko groaned as she now cleared her head. Turning towards Villar the teens eyes went wide as she watched her grandfather held tightly in his grasp. In one fluid motion she watched as Villar snapped Tom&#39;s neck before smashing his body into the ground. &quot;NOOOOOOO!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Villar stretched as he now gazed down at the corpse of Tom Harris. In death the old man appeared at peace. A sinister smile now spread across his face as he looked at the fallen wizards before he vanished into the ether.</p>
