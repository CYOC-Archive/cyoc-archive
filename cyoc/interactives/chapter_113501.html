<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At her estate, Tachibana was relaxing in her zen garden; drinking tea prepared in the traditional Japanese way and in her were-vixen form. The aging were was relaxing for the first time in the day. From sunrise, she was was briefed with what happened regarding Peter Talbot being shot the night prior. Learning of the perpetrator’s father Frederick Parker arriving in town with a cadre of lawyers and then fining out he is still lingering about the town with enough men to cause plenty of problems.<br />
<br />
While the news of Evan Lawson’s son being born and the birth of Martin Stovall’s son and daughter were small blessing to brighten an otherwise dreary day; the birth of three young ones could not dispel the dark pall facing the town. Mayor Samantha Twist taking it upon herself to issue a were-alert as well as instruct the Were-Club and Grrrrrrr to remain close; prudent actions to help protect the town’s secret from the normal’s staying in the town. However, even Tachibana bristled upon hearing the coded messages on KPXX and KMCL regarding no shifting into your fursona during the Labor Day picnic. Like most other weres, she was looking forward to walking around in her were-form; enjoying the feel of the sun’s rays on her fur. Still as a member of the elder council; Tachibana understood that such measures were necessary.<br />
<br />
“Maam,” an attendant approaching; “your honored guests have returned.”<br />
“Thank you,” Tachibana putting her tea down; “please tell I need to talk to them.”<br />
<br />
“You wanted to speak to use,” Far entering the Zen garden with his grandson Kai following behind.<br />
“Please sit down,” Tachibana sighing; “I have some news to inform of you.”<br />
“We have some to tell you as well,” Far answering; “and from your demeanor, your news is just as unpleasant as the news we have to tell you.”<br />
<br />
Tachibana looks at the white were-tigers before her; shaking her head, she begins to tell Far and Kai what has happened recently and the actions the town has enacted to protect itself in light of the out of town individuals lingering.<br />
“Organized crime is never an honorable path,” Far Houjin commenting; “preying on the weak and stealing from others to enrich your life. It is a hard and short life.”<br />
“As long as Freddie The Shark Parker and his men are in town,” Tachibana staring at the two were-tigers; “no one can be outside in their fursonas. We are under a were-alert. This also includes the Labor Day Picinic.”<br />
“You know we have chosen to remain in our fursonas permanently Tachibana,” Kai answering; “we are sort of use to being shut-ins as a result.”<br />
“Yet this is troubling even for us grandson,” Far speaking; “Our new office complex is still under construction and our new residence has yet to clear escrow. I was looking forward to a relaxing stroll in the woods before bed. More so after what we found out today.”<br />
“Speaking of that,” Tachibana looking at her guests; “were exactly have you been?”<br />
<br />
Before Far and Kai answer, they refill Tachibana’s tea and then pour themselves a cup. Sipping it, Kai places on the small table a digital recording device.<br />
“We caught a were-rat prowling where he shouldn’t be,” Far sipping his tea again; “he had that on him.”<br />
“As we were inspecting the progress of our new office building,” Kai continuing the conversation; “we noticed someone breaking into the building across the street. I followed him and discovered him breaking into the office of Frances Twist.”<br />
“Oh god,” Tachibana looking distraught; “do the police know? Does Frances know?”<br />
“No,” Far answering; “Kai discovered the were-rat retrieving that device and quickly subdued him. As for what we were doing the entire day,” Far sighing; “we were interrogating the were-rat as to why he would need to bug a therapist’s office.”<br />
“I do not like where this is going,” Tachibana breathing heavily in an attempt to remain calm.<br />
“His name is Riley,” Kai speaking; “and he was hired by Jack Crawford to pose as a patient and bug Frances’s office for the sole purpose of recording Benton Knights sessions.”<br />
“For what reason,” Tachibana looking pissed.<br />
“Possibly to use against Benton in an attempt to unseat him as CEO of Knight Industries,” Far responding; “If Benton found out…”<br />
“No one would be able to contain the were-panther from physically confronting Crawford,” Tachibana looking glum; “and with his wife planning to announce her candidacy for mayor at the Labor Day Picnic…”<br />
“Riley said Jack had plans for this town and it involved the council,” Far added; “yet he couldn’t elaborate as he wasn’t privy to it all.”<br />
“Somehow you are not telling me everything,” Tachibana looking at the white were-tigers.<br />
“Riley did not give up the information willingly,” Kai speaking; “we were forced to work him over some.”<br />
“And we left his broken body with our business card at Jack’s doorstep,” Far commenting; “he should be getting that package shortly and the message that we are watching.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Jack was not happy with his phone ringing; on the cusp of falling asleep after rutting with his wife Kenya for what seemed like entire day. The were-panther was tired and looking forward to sleep. Grabbing the phone and heading out of the bedroom so as not to disturb Kenya; Jack answers the phone.<br />
“Who is this,” Jack growling; “you better have a good reason for calling me.”<br />
“We found your wayward were-rat,” the gruff man responding; “open your door and let Riley in.”<br />
<br />
The call ends and Jack looks on confused as he heads to the door of his private entrance. Opening the door he sees his hired lackey sprawled out on the floor, barely conscious. Dragging the man inside and looking upset, Jack grabs a glass of water and tosses it on Riley getting him to wake up.<br />
“What the hell happened to you,” Jack looking at the were-rat; “where were you?”<br />
“They tortured me boss,” Riley coughing; “worked me over. I couldn’t take it,” Riley bursting into tears; “I told them everything.”<br />
“Who,” Jack snarling; “was it Benton, Moon Lake’s doddering elder council? Tell Me!”<br />
“They told me to give you this,” Riley holding up a business card in a shakey paw; “they know of you bugging Frances Twists office.”<br />
<br />
Jack snatches the card and looks at it. His demeanor changes from anger to fear.<br />
“Wang Technological Consortium,” Jack looking at the card; “those white were-tigers are still in Moon Lake? They did this to you,” Jack looking at Riley; seeing the were-rat with two broken legs passed out, he swears as he gets on the phone to call those he trusts to collect the broken man on his floor.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Jack storming into his study; “those two will screw things up. Just like they did when they blocked my attempt to win a no confidence motion against Benton at the shareholders meeting. His father showing up and making his speech didn’t help my station,” Jack grumbling to himself; “and now I’m stuck on the fringes of the company my father helped built.”<br />
<br />
Jack,” Kenya appearing at the study entrance in all her were-panthress glory; “why are you talking to yourself? And why is Riley lying on your floor half dead?”<br />
“I’m trying to work out a major complication to our plans darling,” Jack responding; “I have called for some associates to collect Riley and look after him. He was dropped off by some people who are interfering in some business.”<br />
“Anything I should be aware of,” Kenya looking concerned; “will this affect my mayoral announcement this coming Monday?”<br />
“No,” Jack reassuring his wife; “you go back to bed. I’ll join you and,” Jack smiling through his muzzle; “rock you back to sleep once I make a few more phone calls.”<br />
“Well then,” Kenya purring and getting aroused; “hurry up then my big kitty cat.”<br />
<br />
Jack smiles as he watches his wife sashay back to the bedroom; Happy that he found the one he loved, despite ruining her relationship with a werewolf that was dating her. Jack had no beef with Nate Anderson; the were-panther knew the werewolf was kind and gentle to Kenya when they were dating. While Jack knew Nate was aware of Kenya’s past side profession as Kendra Smythe, a high priced escort agent. What Jack did not know was that Lance’s ace reporter was preparing a major expose that will be in the Gazette’s paper come Tuesday; following the questions she intends to grill Kenya over her questionable past come Monday’s mayoral announcement.</p>
