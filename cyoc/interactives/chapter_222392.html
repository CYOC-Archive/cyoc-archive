<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff took a deep breath as he slid the voluminous fabric of the Transcostume pants up his legs. It felt like any other pair of trousers he’d ever worn, the coarse material chafing just slightly against his skin as he fastened the waistband. A strange sense of anticipation filled the air around him as he surveyed his half-normal half semi-truck body. The contrast was eerie and fascinating all at the same time.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the very air around Jeff crackled with energy as the Transcostume pants started to react. It felt like an electric buzz on his skin, a tingle that fizzled and popped from his waist downward. Watching looked like sound waves rippling across a pond, he saw shimmers of silver light dance and warp around his lower half, distorting his view of his legs.<br />
<br />
His knees bulged and twisted awkwardly, strange mechanical noises filling the air as his legs thickened, his skin hardening into what looked like polished, metallic-blue steel. The transformation wasn’t painful, but it wasn&#39;t exactly comfortable. It was like his body had taken on a life of its own, morphing and shifting in ways he&#39;d never imagined possible.<br />
<br />
His feet stretched outwards, becoming elongated and metalized, his toes disappearing into what looked like rugged rubber tyres. The raw power of a semi-truck’s wheels replacing his human feet stirred a peculiar sense of satisfaction within him, as the transformation coursed through his body.<br />
<br />
The transition wave rose upwards, his thighs widening out into the skeletal frame and body of the semi-truck. Bright streaks of white blind spots erupted in chrome decals along the side and his flesh twisted and contorted into essential mechanical parts of a vehicle&#39;s undercarriage. He could see the beginnings of an exhaust system, realistically crafted fuel tanks, and detailed suspension system where his human legs were before.<br />
<br />
His waist morphed into the truck&#39;s underbelly. His human upper half appeared to be emerging from the center of a semi-truck chassis, with the steel framework branching out and spanning behind him to form the truck&#39;s cargo section.<br />
<br />
Jeff had never looked so peculiar. His upper body was still entirely human, contrasting starkly against the metallic expanse of semi-truck that now formed his lower half. So, there he was, half-man and half-semi-truck, in the solitude of the empty car park. <br />
<br />
Now that his lower body was fully transformed into the structure of the semi-truck, Jeff took the upper part of his Transcostume and pulled it over his head. Immediately, he sensed a light sparking sensation, like a cold electric wave ascending up from his belly and lungs. His torso twisted and wound like clay, and he felt a spectacularly bizarre rattling sensation, as if every cell in the upper half of his body was being unscrewed and put back together in an entirely new configuration.<br />
<br />
His abdomen swelled outward, ballooning in a somewhat alarming fashion before it snapped and molded into the massive diesel engine of a semi-truck. This change wasn’t exactly as seamless as his lower half had been. Fasteners, belts, lines, pulleys, and all other equipment typical of a truck engine emerged in a swirling storm of transformation.<br />
<br />
The feeling of change luiquidized and started to crawl up his chest and towards his neck. His shoulders cracked and warped, morphed into the rounded bulky shapes of an eighteen wheeler’s cab exterior, his arms transforming into side view mirrors, mounted on thick metal arms along the sides of what used to be his head.<br />
<br />
His neck stretched forward and his head shaped itself into the front of the truck, complete with a large chrome grill now occupying the space where his mouth was. His nose morphed into the hardy engine hood. His eyes morphed into the wind-screen of the truck, reflecting the world in a panoramic view. His hair, the last to be transformed, rippled and flattened into the smooth roof of the truck’s cab.<br />
<br />
A moment later, the transformation was complete. He was looking at his surroundings through the windshield eyes. He very much felt like himself still, just existing in an entirely new form. Jeff was now a full semi-truck. A shiny, meticulously detailed machine with vibrant blue paint and silver chrome accents where a man once stood. <br />
<br />
Even though Jeff was now a fully transformed semi-truck, his consciousness remained unaffected. He found out quickly enough how to activate his lights. All it needed was a flicker of thought, like the flicking of a switch in his mind, and the sensation of light bursting from his form was thrilling. His face lit up, or rather his headlights did, casting wide, bright cones of light onto the empty car park in front of him.<br />
<br />
Next, Jeff focused his consciousness on his engine. He felt the connection, almost like a mental pull, towards what used to be his stomach area before the transformation. By sending what felt like an adrenaline jolt forward, he experienced a bewildering sensation. His engine roared into life, a deep, pounding throb vibrated throughout his form. Yet, there was no fear or pain, only a sense of indescribable power. It was the raw power of a massive engine, and it was all him.<br />
<br />
Driving was another task entirely. He had to figure out how to get the wheels - previously his feet - to respond appropriately. It took a few tries and a couple of jerky, awkward movement attempts, but with a little concentration, Jeff began to glide smoothly around the car park. <br />
<br />
In his mind, it felt more like walking, urging each wheel to move independently. However, the result was a motion much more graceful. His truck body responded to his mental commands, the wheels turning and bringing him around in smooth arcs and precise turns. The rumble of the tires on the asphalt, the responsiveness of his body, and the wind blowing against his windshield eyes made for an intoxicating sensation. <br />
<br />
Each motion, every turn, every revolution of his wheels was a new touch of exhilaration, a new piece of realization settling in his consciousness. It felt thrilling, surreal, and a tad bit terrifying as he moved around the car park, finally pausing to take in his new form and what he was capable of.<br />
<br />
As Jeff moved around the park, chasing the thrill of his newfound form, he noticed a strange feeling stirring inside. It wasn’t pain or discomfort directly- it was more of a weakening sensation. It was as if he’d been running for miles and miles without a break, like when he used to jogg, and the fuel light in his mind flicked on.<br />
<br />
Without realising it, Jeff had indeed run out of fuel. His engine began to sputter and cough, the smooth thrumming becoming a stuttering hiccup. Suddenly, the motion started to feel like more effort than it had before. He sensed a sudden drain of energy, his exhilaration replaced by a growing sense of lethargy.<br />
<br />
His powerful engine, his bright lights, and the conscious command of his wheels all started to fade as the fuel waned. Despite this, there was no panic within Jeff; only a strong sense of tranquility washed over him. Because much like in his human form where sleep was a necessity, it seemed being a semi-truck required a similar necessity- refuelling.<br />
<br />
Feeling exhausted and hanging onto his last bit of energy, Jeff found a safe spot in the farthest corner of the car park and parked himself. His bright lights dulled to a warm glow then faded completely as his engine gave its final sputter before falling silent.<br />
<br />
A profound silence settled around him and a deep sleep swept over his consciousness. As his truck body lay dormant in the empty car park, Jeff found himself descending into a dream-filled slumber. Much like the man that he once was, even as a semi-truck Jeff was able to dream, his consciousness retreating into a restful oblivion until he can refuel and awaken once more.<br />
<br />
Awakening to the usual pangs of hunger and feeling the unmistakable texture of denim against his skin, Jeff sat up confusedly, a mild disorientation clouding his senses. His truck form was gone, replaced with his familiar human self. He inspected himself, finding two legs, ten fingers, and, most notably, no wheels or metal parts. Someone must have activated the reversal process of his Transcostume.<br />
<br />
In his pocket, he felt an unfamiliar outline. Curious, he pulled out a little card - embellished with a hologram logo and neatly printed words. ‘Transcostume User&#39;s Club’ it read, followed by a tagline that stated it was for &#39;special use cases&#39;. Intrigued, he noticed the specifics - an upcoming date, time, and a location in the city center. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt a rush of emotions. He felt a sense of comfort, as he&#39;d been seen but not judged for trying out the semi-truck Transcostume, an unconventional usage for sure. A community was waiting to welcome him; people, like him, who dared to step out of the ordinary. Perhaps, he&#39;d find same-minded companions in the specialized world of Transcostume. <br />
<br />
So, his semi-truck adventure wasn&#39;t over. Weaving his fingers through his, now entirely human hair, Jeff stared at the setting sun. He felt more alive than he had in a long time, no longer feeling like an oddity. The club meeting was soon, and he decided to attend. It was time to experience this extraordinary world of morphing costumes and embrace his place in it.</p>
