<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec carefully takes the wand. It was quite interesting actually. The thin wand was nearly weightless, but even so, he could feel some kind of power comming from inside of it. &quot;Huh, so is this sorta what all wands look like?&quot;<br />
Alec handed back the wand, not really getting much information about it do to his limited background in magic. <br />
&quot;No at all. Wands can be in many different shapes. But they usually are made with something you can direct towards a target, like a pointed end or a large ball shape. However I have seen wands which have been shaped in such a way in order to not get easily found or to mask their intended target. However usually only either skilled mages are able to wield them, or their loaded spell is meant to be cast upon the holder of the wand and not a target.&quot; Explained Andrea, as she put away the wand. &quot;Furthermore, as I have said earlier, it really is the material that is key for wands. A wand made in the shape of a brick, but made of a superior material will always out preform a beautifully crafted wand made out of a poor material. And before you ask, size matters only if the material&#39;s purity and quality are low. For example, I would need to use an entire branch as thick as my arm to make a wand able to fire a certain spell, but that same spell can be cast from a gemstone the size of my fingernail because it is a better material.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, Alec asked another question. &quot;Huh, I kind of understand it, but, uh, so... there wouldn&#39;t happen to a spell that handles, uh... weight would there?&quot; <br />
&quot;I am not making your bra a wand. For one, the material is garbage, so at best it explodes and you get some minor burns. Also, just deal with it like every other women with large boobs does every single day.&quot; Andrea said, seeing through Alec&#39;s idea instantly. <br />
&quot;But what if it was like a ring or a gem mounted on them, then could you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Could I, certainly. Will I though? ...Depends on the ring or gemstone. What do you have to work with?&quot;<br />
Alec pulled out 2 pairs of rings. They were rather dull, and lacked gems too. &quot;I found these in the Witch&#39;s place&quot; Alec said as he handed the 4 rings over.<br />
&quot;Alec, these can&#39;t become wands&quot; Andrea said the moment the rings touched her hands. &quot;Aw, why not? Are they not a good enough material?&quot;<br />
Andrea shook her head. &quot;It isn&#39;t that. Actually, their material is rather decent. The reason they can&#39;t become wands is because they already have a function.&quot; Alec was sad that they couldnt be used to make a wand, but he was curious about this function. Andrea picked up on that and with a mischievous grin asked &quot;do you want to see what the function is? It was practically made for you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Alec was only somewhat curious before, after hearing that last part, Andrea had gotten his full attention. &quot;Hell yeah. Show it to me!&quot; He shouted excitedly. <br />
&quot;Alright but in order to do it, I need you to do 2 things, and no asking any questions until I am finished ok?&quot; <br />
&quot;If that is what is needed, then sure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright first I need you to show me your breasts, including nipples. The second is to close your eyes. I am sure you will be happy with the outcome so just trust me.&quot; <br />
Alec was now a bit hesitant after Andrea mentioned his breasts. Her evil looking grin didn&#39;t help lower his suspicion either, but he was too intrigued by the rings to stop now and did what she asked. He already had a small guess as to what she wanted to do anyways. However, what he thought she would do, never happened.<br />
<br />
Andrea worked quickly but carefully. She only had 1 shot at this or Alec would stop her. Once she felt she was all lined up, she quickly slipped a ring from each set onto Alec&#39;s nipples, which then tightened around them. Not enough to cause him any harm, but tight enough to not beable to just fall or be pulled off either. With the remaining 2 rings, she had already put one on each of her index fingers before she put on Alec&#39;s rings.<br />
<br />
As she anticipated, the moment the rings tightened, Alec let out a noise which was way more feminine than he was willing to admit. &quot;Did you just put them on my nipples!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep, these are special conversion rings. One ring functions as an intake, and its pair functions as the outflow. These rings just happen to be already set to convert milk into magical power. Meaning if I were to do this.&quot; While pointing her finger,  a small flame shot out. Alec immediately felt something in his right breast get sucked out through his nipple. Honestly it felt good. Like really good. Way better than he expected it to. He didn&#39;t realize that he was absentmindedly squeezing his breasts, trying to remembering it, when Vivian came up behind him and put her own hands on top of his, interweaving their fingers as she joined him in fondling his own boobs. &quot;Starting the party without me are we?&quot; Alec nearly came from the added pair of hands. But Vivian let him go before she let him get too horny. She didn&#39;t want to embarrass him too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Vivian, watch this&quot; said Andrea as she cast another spell using her left hand this time. Again, Alec felt the flow of something, this time inside his left boob now and moved both of his hands over to start massaging that one. &quot;Wow, your tits just got a tiny bit smaller!&quot; Noticed Vivian.<br />
&quot;As they should, I just drained some milk out of those udders. Here Alec, now you try.&quot; Andrea said as she handed Alec the rings. &quot;With these, maybe now even you can do some small amounts of magic, at least until your boobs go away.&quot;</p>
