<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I know what I'm going to change you into,&quot; Kat said with a wicked laugh then uttered the spell she wanted.<br />
<br />
Dan felt the spell wash over him and his clothes disappeared. Next his dick and balls seemed to melt into his groin and once that was done he had a flat, featureless groin. He started shrinking and he felt a need to bend over and grab his feet which he did. His hands and feet melted together and his head melted down into his shoulders and chest. His body thinned out until he was as thin as a piece of fabric. His skin turned red and became silk. Soon a pair of red silk panties were lying by the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he certainly looks nice now,&quot; Rick said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you turn Dan into that Kat?&quot; Patricia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To punish him,&quot; Kat said with a smile. She picked Dan up and said, &quot;The only problem is that I don't have a bra to go with him.&quot; After thinking a bit Kat smiled and said, &quot;That can be easily fixed though.&quot; Without any warning she suddenly pointed her wand at Rick and quickly muttered the spell she wanted.<br />
<br />
Rick felt the spell wash over him and sighed. His transformation followed what happened to Dan pretty closely. His clothes disappeared and his dick and balls melted into his groin until it was smooth and featureless. He grabbed his legs and his hands fused to them. His head melted into his shoulders and chest while his body thinned. His body split making a sort of V shape while his arms became the straps of a bra. His legs formed the band and his ass enlarged a bit to hang below the band forming the underwire of the cups. His skin turned red and silky. Soon a matching bra was laying on the chair. Kat picked Rick up and said, &quot;You can't do anything like this now. I think I'll wear you and Dan out tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what you think,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Kat asked as she dropped Rick like she had just been shocked.<br />
<br />
Rick started growing and changing again until he was standing before Kat fully clothed. With fire in his eyes he raised his wand and muttered a spell. &quot;I told you I was far older than you,&quot; he said as Kat's wand disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; Kat asked looking really scared. &quot;I don't remember any spell I've read.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Rick said calmly. &quot;It's easy to strip your family of your magic. All I had to do was regress you one day and lock you at that age. Since you only become a witch on your eighteenth birthday regressing you to before that wipes out all spells that you have learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you change back?&quot; Kat asked shaking in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very simple,&quot; Rick said smiling. &quot;Pay attention Patty and listen well so you don't make your sister's mistake. When you turned Dan into a pair of panties I knew that you would turn me into a matching bra so I made sure to cast a spell on myself that would allow me to regain my form almost instantly. Now if you had transformed me first I would have been a bra longer but I would have broken your spell anyway. That's because you're a new witch, or rather you were, with nowhere near the power I possess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat dropped Dan and backed up her face going white. &quot;Wh-wh-what are y-y-you g-g-going to do t-t-to m-m-me?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now nothing,&quot; Rick said frowning. &quot;Ordinarily I would be punishing you right away but since your mom is my friend I'm going to wait until she comes home. Now I think I'll change Dan back to human.&quot; He pointed his wand at Dan and uttered a spell.<br />
<br />
Dan began to grow and thicken. His hands separated from his feet. He stopped growing when he reached the height of a five year old. Instead of his dick and balls coming back a slit appeared between his legs. His hair grew to mid-back length and a frilly dress appeared on him. White tights appeared on his legs and black Mary Janes appeared on his feet. He looked at himself and asked, &quot;Why am I a girl? I thought you were going to change me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just said I was going to change you back to human,&quot; Rick said smiling. &quot;I never said I was going to change you back into you old self. Now your parents should be coming back in a few minutes so we'll go back inside and wait for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Patty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry Patty,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Let me help you out then I'll change you into a human girl.&quot; He reached down and helped Patty out then transformed her back into a human girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to miss being a mermaid,&quot; Patty said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I can make it so you can change back and forth with a charm,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I don't have the time to do it right now though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you will?&quot; Patty asked hope filling her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise I will,&quot; Rick said with a smile. &quot;Now lets go in and wait. Don't try to escape Kat or things will be worse for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat froze as she had been edging toward the gate. Rick hadn't been looking at her but somehow he knew what she was doing. With a feeling of defeat and trembling with fear she went into the house and sat down when Rick told her to.<br />
<br />
In a couple of minutes their parents came in and their mom stopped with a surprised look on her face when she saw them. &quot;Why do I have three daughters?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Angie Dan is now a five year old girl as punishment,&quot; Rick said twirling his wand between his fingers. &quot;As for Patrick he wanted to be a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Angie said. &quot;Are you happy Patrick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mummy,&quot; Patty said smiling. &quot;I'm Patricia now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Henry it looks like you're out numbered now,&quot; Angie said smiling at her husband.<br />
<br />
Henry nodded then asked, &quot;Is there a reason why Kat's afraid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick got up from the chair and said, &quot;I'm afraid there is. She turned me into a bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie and Henry's faces went white. Angie quickly dropped to her knees with her hands together and said, &quot;Please go easy on her I beg you. She's new and doesn't understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do that Mum,&quot; Kat said. &quot;You're older than he is. You can take him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not older than he is,&quot; Angie said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're forty-three and he's only in his thirties,&quot; Kat said. &quot;You're older than he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not,&quot; Angie said looking at Kat. &quot;Rick was born on October thirty-first in the year six hundred sixty-six.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that impossible,&quot; Kat said in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know that I regressed you one day and made Dani five,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I've regressed myself many times and I've been very careful not to get killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how?&quot; Kat asked. &quot;Mum told me that when I transformed someone I wouldn't be able to alter anyone's memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a ritual that can alter memories and reality,&quot; Angie said. &quot;Many witches don't bother with it since it's a very delicate ritual. If the witch is interrupted they go mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat looked at Rick with new worry and fear. Rick seemed to see this since he said, &quot;I'm not mad. I've been very careful not to be interrupted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll go easy on her won't you?&quot; Angie asked turning back to Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well seeing as how she was a new witch I can give her a choice,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What choices does she have?&quot; Angie asked seeing a bit of hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she can choose my regular punishment for a witch transforming me,&quot; Rick said. &quot;She can choose to have a trial, she can choose to become a part of my collection, or she can choose to become a five year old boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie turned to Kat and said, &quot;I urge you to choose to become a five year old boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the best option,&quot; Angie said. &quot;The others aren't that good. If you choose to become part of his collection you'll be a doll or some sort of clothing. If you choose to have a trial and are found guilty you'll more than likely be sentenced to be burned at the stake but you won't die. If you choose his regular punishment he'll absorb you into himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat looked at Rick and asked, &quot;Will he be the judge in the trial?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Rick said firmly. &quot;I'll be the prosecutor. Should you go with a trial you'll be provided with a defense counsel. I urge you to think carefully before you tell me which you want. I'm hoping that you choose to become a five year old boy since that will be the easiest on your parents and you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat lowered her head in thought. Rick seemed sure that that she'd lose in a trial and she really didn't want to be burned at the stake. She didn't want to be added to his collection or absorbed in him whatever that meant. She didn't want to become a five year old boy either. At least two options would strip her of ever becoming a witch again. She didn't know what being absorbed would do but she knew that even if she was burned at the stake she would still be a witch as long as she was allowed to age again. But did she really want to risk being burned at the stake if she loses?</p>
