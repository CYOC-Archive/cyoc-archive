<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the other room, Brian sat on the basic bed, completely unaware of Megan’s drastic changes. He sat there looking around the rather plain room, wondering how many people had stayed there before him. He spotted a full-length mirror on the wall across from him. He stood up and walked over to the mirror, removing his drenched shirt and tossing it aside, glancing down at his muscular body and sighed.<br />
<br />
“What are you pondering about Mister Parker?” Cellarius said out loud. Brian turned around quickly, trying to see where he was. He turned back to the mirror, seeing Cellarius standing there in the reflection. <br />
<br />
“You really are some sort of ghost or something aren’t you?” Brian asked.<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily. Though as I said before, I have lived an extraordinarily long time. And over that course of time, I have helped a lot of people become the better version of themselves. So, tell me, what troubles you so?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what you mean…”<br />
<br />
“Oh, please save me the runaround Mister Parker. This house only appears to those who TRULY need it. That much I am positive on. So, I ask again, what is it that troubles you?” Cellarius said, awaiting Brian’s response with a cold stare of his glowing blue eyes. Brian paused, thinking hard on the past few years of his life.<br />
<br />
“I love what I do, helping people get stronger, healthier. But… I often feel too… hulkish.” Brian paused. “You see, when I was young, I didn’t have much attention from women, and I grinded hard in the gym and with work to build myself up to what I am now. But I think I might have overdone it. I mean, sometimes I feel like I’m going to crush poor Megan in my arms!” He laughed. Cellarius even chuckled slightly, but still stared deep into Brian’s soul. “I do like myself; I like being fit, I just… want to be what Megan wants me to be, everything she desires. I owe her that much for the joy she has brought to my life…” Brian said, sighing. Cellarius nodded.<br />
<br />
“Then I think we can help you my good sir…” Cellarius said, disappearing from the mirror, leaving only Brian staring at himself. He put his head down and walked back to the bed, taking off the rest of his wet clothes and lying down. Cellarius on the other hand, had already looked into Megan’s deepest and even darkest desires. Despite her being a very traditional young woman, she had her dark fetishes like everyone else. And Brian was going to fit that build…<br />
<br />
Brian lay there on the bed, relaxing, not realizing that his body was changing. His gargantuan muscles reduced in size slightly, maintaining their strength, but becoming more toned, more cut. As it continued, Brian began to look more like Spiderman and less like Thor. Then, a strong feeling came upon Brian as he started to get an erection. He sighed and lifted his head, looking down upon his body and gasped. His “hulkish” body was no more; rather he had a very toned and attractive figure. His penis was at attention, begging to break free from the confines of his boxers. He pulled off his boxers and walked back to the mirror, only to notice more changes. <br />
<br />
He seemed shorter, and as he watched, he confirmed that his height was shrinking, moving quickly down from his towering six feet to a more modest five foot, seven. He cocked his head, wondering what was happening to him. Almost beginning to panic, a wave of calm washed over him as he continued to watch his transformation. His toned legs started taking on a slight amount of weight as his hips pushed outward, just enough to give him a somewhat shapely lower half. He was transforming into a girl…? <br />
<br />
He wanted to panic, but the calmness in his body remained. His ass materialized with fat, pushing it out to give him a nice bubble butt, accentuating his new shape. His sides pushed inward, becoming narrower than his hips. His shoulders began to shrink as well, not losing any of their muscle mass, but looking more like they belonged on a woman’s body. He groaned as his chest puffed up, growing outward and beginning to jiggle as he gained a new pair of perky C-cup breasts. His neck thinned down as his face began to change. His jaw became slightly less chiseled as any facial hair receded quickly back into his skin. His nose thinned down as his eyes became more seductive. His hair began to grow out, but only on the top as his hair on the sides of his head became buzzed. It continued to grow out until it formed into an undercut ponytail, gaining a dark red dyed color. <br />
<br />
Although he thought the transformation was finished, he closed his eyes after feeling a sharp pain in his head. New memories of growing up as a girl filled his mind. All types of tattoos began to weave themselves over his body; tribal tattoos on his legs, elegant and detailed sleeve tattoos on his arms, and eagle’s wings on his back. <br />
<br />
He opened his eyes and took a deep breath, staring into this new person’s eyes. His reflection still looked like him, almost a twisted version of his sister if he had one. Looking down at his perky breasts and toned, tattooed body, he noticed something that looked totally out of place on his new body; his (or her, their) still-raging erection… They looked around the room and noticed it was different; the bed was now queen-sized with a dark gray comforter and headboard. A weight rack was settled in the corner of the room next to an open closet filled with sports bras and athletic leggings. Another closet next to it had a mix of feminine and masculine clothes, like the wearer preferred both. <br />
<br />
“Well Miss Parker, satisfied?” Cellarius said. Brian spun around to see Cellarius in the mirror again.<br />
<br />
“Satisfied? I’m a freak!” Brian said, stopping mid-sentence after hearing his new, husky female voice. <br />
<br />
“I believe the correct term is futanari. They were quite the spectacle in 12th-Century Japan.” Cellarius said”<br />
<br />
“Why am I a futa?!” Brian asked.<br />
<br />
“Well Miss Parker, you are now Bryce Parker, same age, same career, same relationship with Miss Burgess. However, you are indeed a futanari, which happens to be Miss Burgess’ deepest sexual desire. A desire that you wished to fulfill for her.”<br />
<br />
Bryce was taken aback. Her quiet little Megan, so “traditional”, yet deeply desired to be in a relationship with a futanari?<br />
<br />
“Megan actually desired to be with a futa?” Bryce asked.<br />
<br />
“Indeed. Although she was very much attracted to a certain male appendage,” Cellarius said, pointing down at Bryce’s still rock-hard member, “she always desired the more delicate features of the female anatomy, leading her to explore the dark side of futanari lore and erotica.” Bryce looked down at herself, cautiously grabbing her erection, and sliding her opposite hand up her toned body until it reached her breast. She moaned, squeezing her breast as she began to stroke her penis, feeling incredibly turned on. Cellarius watched but interrupted quickly.<br />
<br />
“Well, I would hope that you become accustomed to your body, but I would save your energy for Miss Burgess.” Bryce immediately stopped.<br />
<br />
“Shit. Megan! Where is she?!” <br />
<br />
“Across the hall where the two of you parted ways. Although, I would say that she is now more your type of woman…” Bryce didn’t even hear Cellarius’ last words before she ran to the door and unlocked it, coming face-to-face with a stranger, who she somehow knew…</p>
