<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barbara thought she wouldn’t be able to fall asleep, she expected to want to look at herself in the full-length mirror which hung on the back of the door. She expected to want to see her new succubus body, to study it, to feel it and to pleasure herself. She expected that, she didn’t expect that the moment she sat down on the bed that all the strength seamed to leave her body and she passed out with just enough time to kick off her shoes. <br />
<br />
She awoke to find sunlight coming in from the window, she could hear birds singing and judging by the amount of sunlight coming it she would have to guess it had to be around 9 or so in the morning. At first she studied her room not fully remembering where she was or what happened, her body still hurt. Then she saw the orange skin, horns, wings, and tail which reminded her of what she had become. Slowly she stood up and did a quick change of clothes. The only clothing, she had was school cloths so it would have to do, still she didn’t tuck in the shirt and opened didn’t button it all the way showing off more of her larger bust. The shirt and the back of her pants had cuts in them to allow her wings and tail out which was harder to button but she did it and taking a deep breath she walked out of the room. <br />
The common room was three or four doors down and she heard voices coming from there. She walked in and paused as she saw sights, she wouldn’t have imagined just the day before. She had been told there are 36 succubus and Incubus in her class and almost a 1/3rd of them in the common room.<br />
<br />
The more she looked the more she realized that succubus/incubus had similar traits, everyone of them had horns, some had ram like horns, other spikes. All of them either had forked tails, wings either bat like or her own practical like or both. She had both but some of them had only wings, others had only tails. <br />
<br />
Her eyes turned to focus on the small groups, her eyes landed on this black skinned succubus who was doing yoga by one of the windows. She had jet black skin which was blacker than the black yoga pants and skintight top she was wearing, somehow even darker hair with four small purple horns. She didn’t have wings, but her tail looked slightly longer and she looked extremely flexible. She had didn’t have large breasts, but she was twisting in ways she had never seen before. <br />
<br />
Her eyes moved toward a nearby table where a succubus and an Incubus were sitting together working on what looked to be schoolwork all the while enjoying one’s company. The succubus was dressed in a dark red corset which laced up the front making her smallish breast look bigger, she had bat like wings and lacked a tail. Her dark red hair was cut into a pixie cut which was longer in the front, her red skin stood in contrast with her partner. Their tails were wrapped around each other under the table in a way which reminded Barbara of hand holding. The Incubus had Kelly green skin didn’t look as well defined as she was expected, he was active but wasn’t ripped. He reminded her of a sexy nerd, he didn’t have glasses but wouldn’t have been surprised if he had, his jet-black hair was cut simply with forest green ram like horns sticking out the side of his head. <br />
<br />
Barbara’s eyes turned to the next group, it was an incubus and two succubi sitting at a table sharing what looked to be tea. One of the succubi had bronze skin but she had six small horns all dark red color coming out of her long bright red hair. She wore a red corset which came to points at her larger breasts, she didn’t have wings but kept her back open none the less, her tail was under the table holding the tails of the other two. <br />
<br />
The Incubus was well built and wore the most cloths she had seen so far, a black T-shirt with a band she actually knew on it. His skin looked almost human maybe a little pale but basically human, he seemed to have a swimmer’s body. He had golden color horns and a pair of wings coming out of his back. His blonde hair was bright but not as bright as her own.  <br />
<br />
The other succubus had pale blue skin and long white hair, her horns where silver and she seamed shorter than the others. She wore a silver white dress which stopped between her knees and her waist. She spoke of culture and elegance. <br />
<br />
Where those three a couples she didn’t know.<br />
<br />
She spotted Nikki, the pale pink succubus she spotted last night sitting by herself eating breakfast of what smelled like microwaved oatmeal. Nikki was the first to notice her and nodded her welcome. <br />
<br />
On the ground nearby was an shirtless Incubus who was doing sit ups, his muscles rippling and dancing with sweet. He was wearing only a tight pair of black shorts which showed a very large bulge in the center. His skin was a golden color, and his hair was cut so short she couldn’t tell his hair color but spotted two lines of horns going back into what would be his hair line like a mohawk. <br />
<br />
What really caught her attention was a pair of succubi going to town on each other on the large group bed located in the center of the room. It was another red succubus, with long curly black hair. She was lying on the bed with her wings spread out and her tail on the ground. <br />
<br />
“More!” she ordered with force to the charcoal grey succubus who she had by the green hair who was pleasuring her with her tongue. By the way the red succubus was acting toward the green succubus it reminded her of an abusive relationships. <br />
<br />
No one was reacting to two people going to town like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
“What a strange place.” Whispered Barbara </p>
