<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria and the others now found themselves on the move once more. Tatsu and Shizen had effectively quieted Aiko who now trailed behind, her head hung low. Turning towards Shizen, she now wanted to know Aiko&#39;s fate. &quot;Is she going to be okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shizen gave Gloria a serene smile, glancing back at the four tailed vixen. &quot;Aiko shall not be harmed if that is what you fear,&quot; Shizen said calmly. &quot;My husband and I shall deal with Fukushus followers after this is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how much trouble ate they in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our sons true believers as well as our son shall be dealt with severely,&quot; she frowned. &quot;However, I understand that some were led astray but false promises. When things have calmed down my husband and I shall have to think of how to bring them closer to our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria could only nod, it appeared the kitsune would have to do some serious soul searching when everything was all said and done. Turning once more Gloria was about to continue along the path before Merlin appeared before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus,&quot; Claudia exclaimed, grasping her chest. &quot;The hell Merlin? You trying to give us a heart attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies,&quot; Merlin said quickly. &quot;But a dire situation has arisen. It appears the hotel is under attack.&quot; Gasps of shock and worry now now emanated from the group. Gloria could see Katie, Samantha, Mika, and Claudia now visibly upset as they thought of their children.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got to go now,&quot; Claudia exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Felicia exclaimed. &quot;We still need to save the baby. If we split up will we be able to stop Fukushu?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now paused as they shifted nervously in place. They were in between a rock and a hard place. &quot;Claud,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Head back with Jackie, Mike, and Shiro. The rest of us need to reach Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to head back too,&quot; Naomi said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Diane added. &quot;Let&#39;s face it. My magic isnt strong enough. I&#39;ll be more helpful saving our families.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika,&quot; Claudia said solemnly. &quot;I have too. Kari, my brother, I have to make sure they&#39;re okay.&quot; Mika gave her fiance a stiff nod, giving her a quick kiss as they vanished with Merlin.<br />
<br />
************************<br />
<br />
Things were rapidly deteriorating at the hotel, whatever these things were they were extremely hard to kill. Cole now tried to catch his breath as he checked his ammo. &quot;Damn down to my last clip.&quot; Turning towards Ann and Vixi he could see they appeared exhausted. &quot;How you two holding up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Been better,&quot; Ann grumbled. Looking at the animatronic she could see a large hole in its body. &quot;Vixi you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The damage I&#39;ve sustained is superficial,&quot; she replied happily. &quot;I can still function at nearly 100%.&quot;<br />
<br />
An unholy cry now echoed through the hotel as the trio listened to the death cry of one of the Voids. &quot;Vixi can you determine how the others are doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vixi nodded, her eyes flashing as she appeared to scan the hotel. &quot;Rexie and Ayami appear to be 200 yards to the East,&quot; she said. &quot;They appear to be engaged in battle with a pair of unknown magical entities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they okay,&quot; Ann asked.<br />
<br />
Vixi&#39;s robotic smile seemed to falter slightly as she scanned the demon and succubus. &quot;Their life signs are fluctuating,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;They appear to be injured.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Cole spat. Taking a deep breath he now turned towards Ann and Vixi. &quot;Okay listen Vixi I want you to head towards those two and help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you,&quot; Ann asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Cole stated. &quot;Vixi can you tell me about the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Vixi said. &quot;I can sense four wizards 50 yards from our position. They appear to be engaged in a battle with a singular magical entity. However I&#39;ve noticed a magical being dangerously close to the locations of the children and their families. It appears to be a kitsune.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I&#39;ll check that one out,&quot; Cole said. &quot;Listen, chances are the others probably know what&#39;s going on and are on their way. We need to hold out until then. Be safe and dont take any unnecessary chances.&quot; Ann and Vixi nodded as they sped off to help Ayami and Rexie.<br />
<br />
Cole took a deep breath as he now headed towards his room. From what he had learned from Vixi it appeared the kitsune were now after his family. Cole was confident the others could handle themselves, it was up to him now to make sure their families stayed safe until help arrived. Withdrawing his kabar he now sped down the hall.<br />
<br />
Cole paused as he reached the hallway leading to his room, glancing down he furrowed his brow in anger. Cole could see an anthro fox with five tails now slowly inspecting the various rooms, a pair of kunai in his hands. Cole wasnt sure how strong these kitsune were or even if they could be hurt, his only experience dealing with kitsune so far had been his own adopted niece Kari. Still, he couldnt let anything happen to the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for something,&quot; Cole asked.<br />
<br />
Akira turned, a small smile on his face as he bowed before Cole. &quot;Greetings mortal,&quot; Akira smiled. &quot;I take it you have come to stop me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that,&quot; Cole grumbled as he pointed his pistol at Akira. Akira laughed softly as he now assumed a fighting stance. &quot;Foolish mortal,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;What chance do you have against a kitsune warrior?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The question you should be asking is what chance you have against a Marine,&quot; Cole grinned. Akira&#39;s mouth curled into a snarl as the five tails now launched himself forward.<br />
<br />
Cole was able to deflect Akiras initial attack, taking a swipe with his kabar before firing off a series of shots at him. Akira was surprised at Cole&#39;s skill as he dodged the fire before being slashed across his cheek. Delivering a kick to Coles midsection he now slashed Cole across the chest as the former marine rolled out of the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have skill,&quot; Akira said in awe, wiping the blood from his cheek. &quot;Perhaps this will be a challenge worthy of my talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole smirked as he readied himself. The marine had been in plenty of situations fighting opponents who were stronger or faster than him. Judging by Akiras actions he could tell Akira was both. Still, the kitsune did have one flaw. <br />
<br />
Cole could tell that Akira was arrogant in his abilities. If Cole could get under his skin he could rattle him, tipping the tide of battle in his favor. &quot;Was going to say the same,&quot; he grinned. &quot;But to be honest. You fight like a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira snarled lunging at Cole and cutting him across the arm. &quot;You dare insult me,&quot; he bellowed as he tossed Cole down the hallway.<br />
<br />
Cole smirked noticing the fresh cuts he had delivered to Akiras exposed arm. &quot;Not much of an insult when you havent shown me anything,&quot; Cole grinned. &quot;Now you gonna start fighting or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira growled lunging once more at Cole with furious and deadly strikes. A less skilled combatant would have fallen under Akiras blows, fortunately for Cole he was one of the best the Marines had ever produced.<br />
<br />
Cole smiled inspite of the injuries he had sustained. Akiras last attack had left him with fresh wounds along his arms and chest. Akira though was also taking damage, more importantly was the fresh slash over Akiras eyes, a wound that now bled and compromised his vision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your skill is impressive mortal,&quot; Akira smiled. &quot;But even you must realize the futility of your efforts. Yield and I may spare the life of you and your loved ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole grunted as he now held a hand over a nasty gash along his side. He needed to stall for time, just a little more time. &quot;Keep him talking,&quot; Cole thought. &quot;Just a little longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must not be too familiar with the Marines,&quot; Cole sighed. &quot;Marines dont quit. Now it&#39;s YOUR last chance, give it up or I&#39;m putting you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira chuckled softly as he now prepared to deliver a death blow. Before he could act a massive fireball collided with him sending him sprawling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole turned, smiling as his sister now raced to his side. &quot;Bout time chipmunk,&quot; he smiled. &quot;What took you?&quot;</p>
