<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaiah stared at his father, a devilish grin spreading across his face. &quot;There&#39;s a way to reverse the effects,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#39;s a vial in the machine that contains the taken years in liquid form. Once drank, the person who takes it gains those years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s heart raced at the thought of getting his old body back. &quot;Hand it over, son,&quot; he said, holding out his hand.<br />
<br />
But instead of giving it to him, Isaiah opened the vial and drank the liquid inside.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s eyes widened in shock and anger. &quot;What the hell did you just do?&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
Isaiah smirked as a strange sensation overtook him. He felt a jolt of energy surge through his body as he started to grow taller and more muscular. His skin stretched tight over his expanding muscles, and his clothes began to strain at the seams. He flexed his arms, watching in awe as the biceps bulged and the veins stood out in relief.<br />
<br />
Eric watched in disbelief as his son slowly transformed into a muscular man before his very eyes. He couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. He had lost his youth and strength to his own son, and now Isaiah was growing into the very image that Eric had once been.<br />
<br />
As Isaiah continued to grow, Eric couldn&#39;t help but feel a twinge of envy. He missed his old body, the way it felt to be strong and powerful. But at the same time, he was filled with a strange sense of pride, watching his son become the man that Eric had once been.<br />
<br />
Finally, the transformation had finished. Eric and Isaiah stared at each other, speechless. The tables had turned, and Eric was now the smaller, weaker one while Isaiah towered over him with his broad shoulders and rippling muscles.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s mind raced with conflicting emotions. He was angry that his son had taken his years, but at the same time, he was proud of the man that Isaiah had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done?&quot; Eric asked, his voice trembling.<br />
<br />
Isaiah grinned, flexing his arm. &quot;I&#39;ve become the man of the house,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s heart sank as he realized that his son was right. He was no longer the strongest, most powerful person in their home. Isaiah had taken his youth and his strength, and Eric was left feeling small and powerless.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be smaller,&quot; Eric said, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;But I&#39;m still the grown-up.&quot;<br />
<br />
saiah couldn&#39;t believe what had just happened. He had stolen his father&#39;s years, and now he was a muscular man. His biceps bulged, and his chest puffed out as he flexed in front of the mirror. He felt invincible, powerful, and confident in his new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder you work out so much, Dad,&quot; Isaiah said as he admired himself in the mirror. &quot;This is awesome. I&#39;m the man now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric watched in disbelief as his son flexed and posed, his new muscles rippling under his skin. He couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isaiah, we have to switch things back,&quot; Eric said, his voice shaking with concern. &quot;This isn&#39;t right. You&#39;ve taken my years, and you&#39;re not ready for this kind of responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaiah just laughed and continued flexing. &quot;No way, Dad. I like being the man of the house. I like being bigger and stronger than you. I&#39;m not giving this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was at a loss for words. He had always been the dominant force in their household, the one in charge, but now he was looking up at his own son, who was now towering over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Dad, let&#39;s compare muscles,&quot; Isaiah said, grabbing his father&#39;s arm and pulling him close. &quot;I want to see how much bigger I am now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric reluctantly lifted his arm, and Isaiah smirked as he flexed his bicep, which was now larger than Eric&#39;s head. Isaiah then lifted Eric up with one arm effortlessly, showing off his newfound strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, Dad? I&#39;m the man now,&quot; Isaiah said, setting his father down. &quot;And I&#39;m not going to give this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was shocked and scared. He didn&#39;t know what to do or how to reverse the effects of the machine. He just knew that his son was now a grown man, and he wasn&#39;t sure how to handle it.<br />
<br />
Isaiah left his father&#39;s room and went to his own bedroom. He stood in front of the mirror, admiring his new muscles and flexing in his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible,&quot; Isaiah said to himself as he ran his hand over his abs. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to be big and strong like Dad, and now I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaiah continued to flex and pose, exploring his new muscles and feeling invigorated by his newfound strength. He couldn&#39;t imagine going back to his old self now that he had experienced this.<br />
<br />
Eric sat alone in his room, feeling small and weak. He didn&#39;t know what to do or how to fix this. He had to find a way to get his years back, but he wasn&#39;t sure how.</p>
