<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oakius took you in the forest until you reached a very large leafy tree. He called upwards, still holding you upon his shoulder. You craned your neck backwards to see what was happening. A snake slithered down and started talking. An enormous snake. <br />
&quot;Hello, Oakius. Greetings. What can I do for you?&quot;<br />
&quot;This is my new conquest and favorite. But she is deluded. She thinks she is a man, in spite of bearing no sign of magic. You&#39;ve helped my new recruits adjust to their sweet life amongst us before. Also for the ones that had silly second thoughts. Care to do it with this adorable nymph? Take her silly thoughts out of her pretty head.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; answered the snake, flicking its tongue. &quot;Any weak points?&quot;<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t had time to discover any.&quot;<br />
But then he snapped his fingers.<br />
&quot;Ah! Yes. She&#39;s got ticklish feet.&quot;<br />
He demonstrated, leading you to laugh but soon to get very angry.<br />
&quot;That can work. Come back tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
Before you knew what was happening, a leathery, smooth, scaly muscle looped around your legs and hoisted you into the tree. And into more coils. You yelped in surprise and fear.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, dearest. Listen well to your new teacher. I shall come for you tomorrow morning. Or afternoon. Depending how much I drink to celebrate our intense union.&quot;<br />
He left you as the snake tightly immobilised you, leaving only your feet and head outside its coils. The animal held you firmly, but still enough to breathe and talk. His head reached your eye level and stared at you intently. <br />
&quot;So. You assume you are a man? How strange. You don&#39;t look like a man. Are you sure?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes! I am a man! I am!&quot;<br />
&quot;Problem is, you are not. You are female, I assure you. If you continue thinking that way, you shall become most unhappy, distraught and even mad. Let&#39;s remedy to that, shall we?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Please!&quot; <br />
&quot;Just relax. You&#39;ll be so much happier afterwards. Moreover, you&#39;ve already enjoyed Oakius. So forget your worries and listen to me.&quot;<br />
You tried to struggle but it was useless. The snake tried to stare at you. He was trying to hypnotize you! You closed your eyes but even that didn&#39;t work. With the tip of its tail, he poked the soles of your feet. The tickles made you laugh and the snake said it would not stop until you opened your eyes. You refused but under the tickling assault, you did open your eyes a crack. You saw the eyes of the snake and could not help looking back at them. They were so odd... Circling endlessly... <br />
&quot;Breathe in.... Breathe out....&quot; said the snake softly. &quot;I can help you, you now...&quot;<br />
It was interesting to gaze into the eyes of the snake. And the more you did, the harder it felt to tear yourself away from those. And the snake had a soothing voice. A nice one... Not aggressive at all... It was a soft, melodious voice... Pleasant to hear...<br />
&quot;You are relaxed now. I can feel it. What an obedient nymph you are! No wonder Oakius praises you so!&quot;<br />
The compliments made you fuzzy and happy.<br />
&quot;Oh, you are blushing!&quot; said the snake with amusement. &quot;You like compliments? Of course you do. You deserve them. You&#39;re such an innocent little thing. No wonder everyone fawns over you. You are so gentle and innocent. You&#39;ll make Oakius&#39; village delighted to have you. You could gather sweet fruits, play with the children, serve happy men that are a bit too foolish for their own good,... You will make so many new friends.&quot;<br />
That all sounded nice. The snake&#39;s voice made this future all the more logical and blissful. But... But there was one thing that troubled you still. Something important.<br />
&quot;But... But I am a man...&quot;<br />
&quot;What a strange idea! Would a man laugh like that?&quot;<br />
The snake then proceeded to lick your feet expertly, circling the balls of your feet, tracing the arch and even flicking it between your toes. You could not stop shrieking in laughter, begging the snake to stop. The snake did not, just commenting on how dainty and small your feet were. And sensitive. And ticklish. When he finally stopped, you were catching your breath. <br />
&quot;Your laughter is sweet to hear. Tell me, beautiful, does that sound like the voice of a man. Tell me the truth.&quot;<br />
The eyes incited you to be honest. It would have been mean to lie. <br />
&quot;It is the laugh of a woman.&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed. And what is so wrong about being a woman? Especially a woman like you? A nymph about to live a wonderful life?&quot;<br />
<br />
All through the night, the snake gently spoke to you, countering your arguments with lullaby-like talk, melodious words and comments irradiating good sense. Indeed, being the most beautiful nymph amongst the satyrs would be pure bliss. Other nymphs would become your friends and Oakius was a generous, wise and kind leader. Partying was fun! All days would be spent in play, like an eternal vacation. Everyone would praise you and love you. You possessed eternal youth and beauty. Anyone would wish for that! No worries, no stress and no misfortune. Already after that amazing sexual intercourse, you had thought about your life here and it had appeared natural and something anyone would look forward to. A calm, happy and blissful life. Oakius would always adore you and his pride and elation at seeing your belly bulge with children would be proof of his endearment and devotion to you. The idea of seeing your belly swell with new life, big, fat toddler satyrs and delicate nymphs that would grow up naked and without the cares of their ancestors, sweet and endearing in their innocent youth was pure paradise. The snake whispered details about your future life and all the advantages of being a youthful female. The attention of males and even other females would be amusing and quite nice. Males looked so happy when their penises were tended to. Their needs were so simple! Not sophisticated like females were. Ah, males! Those giants with clay feet. So arrogant yet so insecure and ridiculous at times! But so strong and sweet and willing to please females in turn! And all males were handsome in nature. Like all females, too. And everyone one else, for that matter. And all the food and beverages to be had... Yes, you were the fairest in a bucolic paradise. Why would you forsake such a life and be discontent with it? You were beautiful and happy. Why had you even considered beauty being a curse earlier? Hoping for more sex and happy intercourse and meals was a lot more logical. Yes, you could not wait for your new life to start! The snake was right, sleeping would make the first day of your new life come faster. And you&#39;d need your strength to please and take pleasure from Oakius again. <br />
<br />
When Oakius arrived at the tree in early afternoon, the snake presented his new gorgeous lady laid out upon his body, beautifully sleeping, delicate arms and legs dangling on the sides and gently being cradled from side to side. A picture of blissful rest, so innocent in her simple nudity. His crotch was already palpitating and straining in anticipation. With that coming bulge, it would take all night to calm his arousal and burning love. And from the peace coming off from the dainty nymph in waves, it seemed the snake had been more than successful. He thanked his friend, gathered his love in his arms and kissed your forehead. You moaned, smiled and snuggled more into his embrace. Oakius adored you even more. He would ravish you so much and your own arousal be so great that it would be surprising for you not to get pregnant with twins or triplets. Life was sweet indeed. And especially for the beautiful, he thought as he kissed you again.</p>
