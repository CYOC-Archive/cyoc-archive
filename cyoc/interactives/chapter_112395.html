<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Emilio stood in the doorway, staring dully at John.  John did his best to smile, trying to put his fears at ease.  But Emilio&#39;s expression never changed.  John was a little perplexed. He expected some type of reaction - fear, laughter, shock ... something.  But Emilio&#39;s expression never faltered, and he continued to look at John with a cold stoney face.  Emilio was a stoner and John thought maybe he was doped up.  He was about to say something when Emilio suddenly turned around and reentered the apartment, hollering &quot;Milk&#39;s here!&quot;<br />
<br />
John was conflicted with mixed emotions - confusion at his indifference and anger at being treated like a delivery boy.  Maybe only he could see the changes.  Maybe the old lady had doped him and this was just some weird LSD trip.  But a yell from his roommate quickly brought John back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t just leave it out there.  Bring it in, you idiot, &quot; yelled back Rob, his roommate.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t order it, dude.  And it&#39;s your apartment. You get it.  I don&#39;t want to touch that thing, &quot; said Emilio, as he sauntered into the apartment.<br />
<br />
John was really confused.  He didn&#39;t understand what was going on.  But he knew his friends were inside, so he nervously entered the apartment.  He had to duck down through the doorframe, acutely aware now of just how big he was.  He looked across the room at his friends gathered around the TV.  A few cast nervous glances his direction, but most stayed glued to the TV watching the game. Only Rob approached him, loudly cursing Emilio&#39;s laziness.<br />
<br />
He looked John up and down.  Before John could explain, Rob interrupted him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, it doesn&#39;t even have a leash.  Lucky I still have my leash from last time.  But they didn&#39;t say anything about that when I ordered.  I really should get a discount or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
John was still at a loss, stuttering to get a word in edgewise. But Rob quickly returned with a thick collar and long leather leash.  Silently he fastened the collar around John&#39;s neck and began to pull him towards the small kitchen.<br />
<br />
The pain in his neck brought John out of his stupor.  He struggled to talk as the collar tightened around his neck each time Rob pulled him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait .... stop .... don&#39;t, &quot; grunted John as he was dragged towards the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn these things are stubborn.  Hope I don&#39;t need the rod.  I don&#39;t know if its charged, &quot; muttered Rob as he ignored John and continued to pull.  When John finally braced himself and held his ground, Rob turned to look him in the eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;COME .... OR YOU GET SHOCK,  &quot; said Rob slowly and loudly, as if John was a stupid child.  <br />
<br />
&quot;UNDERSTAND.  ZZZT,&quot; said Rob, miming the shock of a cattle prod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be cruel, &quot; said Jenny, as she came up and gently petted John.  &quot;We won&#39;t hurt you, girl. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are just dumb animals.  You have to be rough with them.  Besides, their hides are so tough they can barely feel it, &quot; said Rob.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still mean.  COME WITH ME, PLEASE, &quot; said Jenny, loudly but sweetly. <br />
<br />
John complied, allowing Jenny to lead him into the kitchen.  She smiled triumphantly at Rob, implying that her method of kindness was superior.  Rob just rolled his eyes and followed them.<br />
<br />
There were just a few people in the kitchen. A small TV was resting on the counter and Jenny tied the end of his leash to a small bar in front of the counter.  John had to lean down uncomfortably, and Jenny motioned for him to kneel.  He did so and found it much easier, resting his hands and knees on the floor. The other guests looked uncomfortable and cleared out, leaving only Rob, Jenny and Cora in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, those things freak me out.  They almost look human, &quot; said Cora.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cora, help,&quot; John pleaded to his friend with large sad eyes.<br />
<br />
The others stared at him in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; said Cora. &quot;How does it know my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob chuckled and pointed to the paper cub she was holding, with her name clearly printed on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;These things are stupid, but sometimes I wonder if they might be smarter than you, &quot; said Rob with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Cora turned bright red.  &quot;Whatever.  They are still freaky and I don&#39;t like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But their milk tastes really good, &quot; teased Rob.  &quot;Once you try it, you won&#39;t be satisfied with anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink from that thing.  No way, &quot; said Cora repugnantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, be nice.  They are just like any other animal.  They just look a little different, that&#39;s all, &quot; said Jenny, as she stroked John&#39;s muzzle soothingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I thought you were the radical adventurous type.  Try some, &quot; said Rob, as he grabbed a cup and placed it beneath one of John&#39;s teats.  He was about to milk it when John reared back away from his hand. Rob scowled angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, easy, girl, &quot; said Jenny soothingly.  &quot;We aren&#39;t going to hurt you. We just want to share a little of your nice milk. Don&#39;t you want to get rid of all the heavy milk weighing down that pretty little udder? It will make you feel good, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... &quot; muttered John, still in a state of shock.  He was still confused and very frightened.  He didn&#39;t understand what was going on. Why didn&#39;t his friends recognize him?  His thoughts were muddied and confused and he found it difficult to find the words to explain the situation. &quot; Not .. not a cow... I&#39;m John.  I&#39;m John.  This is ... mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
They stared at him in bewilderment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what she means,&quot; said Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing.  Nonsense, &quot; said Rob angrily.  &quot;These things just know a little English and repeat it.  Like a parrot or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.  It gives me the creeps.  I don&#39;t drink milk from nothing that talks to me. Well, at least since I was a baby,&quot; said Cora.<br />
<br />
Rob scowled.  &quot;Listen, it cost me a lot to rent this thing and I am not going to be the only one to drink from it.  Here, if the talking bothers you so much, we&#39;ll just feed it.  That should shut it up, &quot; said Rob, as he strapped a feeding bag onto John&#39;s face.  <br />
<br />
John tried to protest, but the aroma of the oats and grains was too enticing.  He found himself almost involuntarily munching on the feed. The food soothed his aching, hungry stomach and eased his fear. He could always explain later.  After he was fed.</p>
