Shadows of the Past<br />
<br />
Rob enjoyed being the athletic teen that looked back at him from the mirror on the gym wall.  He and Dustin were working their delts doing dumbbell lat raises.  He smiled both from the pump he was getting working the muscles and the image in the mirror.  This was the same mirror he had first seen the muscular teen that now looked back at him, sweating and tired as he finished another set.  The slight fatigue and burn across his shoulders felt good.  It meant that the muscle would be growing.  Peter had given him a good start but both Rob and Dustin wanted their muscular builds to be their own, paid for by sweat in the gym, and not granted to them by Dustin’s powerful brother or more powerful cousin.  The trip from 52 back to being a teenager was something he was in debt to Peter for.  But Peter was one of those rare people that actually helped people without expecting anything in return.  <br />
<br />
Dustin and Rob finished up their shoulder routine and moved on to chest.  Rob had finish a set and was getting ready to spot for Dustin when and older couple entered the gym.  Panic struck Rob as he recognized the couple as his parents.  His parents, unable to reach him at his apartment or at work, had come to find out what had happened.  Rob had called in to his work and asked to be on leave for a few weeks to handle some personal issues, as they hadn’t paid him in months they couldn’t really refuse.  But the last time he spoke with his parents was on Thanksgiving, before Peter had transformed him.  He had been meaning to call them and explain that he would be unavailable for a few weeks but other things got in the way.  Frankly working out, running and reliving high school as a jock stud had been so much fun he hadn’t thought about much else for the last couple of weeks.   From his parent point of view he had dropped off the face of the earth when Peter made him a teen.  That was pretty much what had happened the old Rob was gone.  And now the new Rob would need to make peace with his past.  Dustin, ready to start his set, sees that Rob is distracted and gives him a nudge to bring him back to earth.  A bit startled Rob looks down at Dustin and says, “Oh, sorry.”  Dustin replies, “What’s wrong?  You look like you’ve just seen a ghost.”  Rob looks back to the couple that is now talking to the gym owner and says, “In a way I have.  You see that older couple talking to Gene?”  Dustin sits up and nods. Rob looks back at Dustin and says, “There’s a chance I’m wrong but I think that couple are my parents.”  “Let’s go over and you can introduce me,” said Dustin.  Rob responds, “I don’t think that’s a good idea right now.  If I’m right, they’re looking for their missing 52-year-old son.  We walk up to them, couple of punk kids they have never seen before, and I say, ‘Hi Mom and Dad… this is my buddy Dustin… Sorry I hadn’t called but since Dustin’s cousin Peter turned me into a teenage muscle boy I’ve been having so much fun I kept forgetting to give you a call,’ I think that would play really well.”  “Yeah, I see what you mean,” said Dustin, “What are you going to do?”  Rob shook his head and shrugged his shoulders, “I don’t know… Do I tell them the truth???  I don’t think they would believe it if I did…  If I went like this to tell them… I need to think about this…  What ever I do I think I’ll need Peter’s help,” sighed Rob.  <br />
<br />
The couple leaves a few flyers with the gym owner and leave.  And Gene, the gym owner, goes to post the flyers on the bulletin boards, one near the entrance and the other by the locker room.  Rob and Dustin walk over to the board to look at the flyer.  “Well, I was right,” said Rob, “They are looking for me.” And Dustin said, “Gee, I guess they really care about you.”  Rob sighs, “Yeah, they do.  Most parents do even if the kids don’t believe it.  I should have remembered to call…  That would have given me more time…”  “More time, for what?” asked Dustin, somewhat puzzled.  Rob frowned, something Dustin had not seen Rob do since the night they met here, several weeks ago.  Rob said, “Time to decide whether I stay with you guys, go back to my old life or attempt some mix of the two.  I had forgotten that other people that I do care about are involved in this… I don’t feel much like working out anymore tonight let’s head home… I need to think.”  Dustin is shock he had always had to drag Rob out of the gym and tonight Rob was quitting half way through the routine they had planned.  “Ok, lets hit the showers then,” said Dustin trying to sound cheerful.  “No, lets just get out of here,” said Rob, “and if you don’t mind I want to stop by my apartment on the way.”  Dustin could tell Rob was upset.  But he didn’t think Rob wanted to talk about it now.<br />
<br />
On the way to Rob’s apartment Dustin thought about his parents.  Ty and Dustin’s relationship with their folks had been less than good especially for Ty.  In fit of rage toward Mark and June, Dustin’s father and mother, for their abusive treatment, Ty had banished them from existence.  Since then Dustin’s relationship with his brother (or was it foster brother, Dustin shook his head to clear it) had improved and they were now close friends in addition to brothers.  Why was Rob upset?  It’s not like they were likely find him or even recognize him if he walked up to them.  And Peter or even Ty could fix that problem easily.  What was bothering his new buddy?<br />
<br />
They got to Rob’s apartment and Rob let them in.  Dustin waited in the living room while Rob wandered seemingly aimlessly from room to room.  Finally Rob searched a couple of boxes of book and retrieved his high school yearbooks and they left.  When they got home Rob told Dustin that he wasn’t hungry and didn’t want any dinner.  Rob then went to his room and locked the door.  Concerned by Rob’s sudden mood shift Dustin goes to talk to Peter and Ty.  After Dustin relates the events at the gym and apartment, Peter says, “I didn’t realize Rob had any relatives” Peter closes his eyes and concentrates.  “Both parents, a brother and a sister, he is the eldest, several nephews by his sister, a brother-in-law and the girlfriend of his brother.  I didn’t pick up on any of them until now,” said Peter opening his eyes.  “I didn’t think there was anything in his old life that he wanted to keep,” said Peter, “It’s no wonder that he’s upset confused and torn in the situation he’s in.  He wants to stay with us but he doesn’t think his folks would understand or approve of his wanting to stay here.  And he thinks if he does stay with us it will hurt his folks, and if he told his folks the full truth about what has happened it could cause us problems.”  Peter shakes his head and says, “We need to let him work through this on his own for a while.  And we all have homework to do.  Let him work it out by himself for now.<br />
<br />
When he got to his room, Rob pulled off the still damp tank top he had been wearing at the gym and tossed it into the laundry pile and flopped onto his bed.  He lay on his back reclining against the headboard and pillow, right hand behind his neck and the left lay on his stomach, where it unconsciously traced the ridges of his chiseled abdominal muscles.  He lay frowning at the ceiling as the Sun set and the twilight changed to darkness.  An hour or more ago Ty had knocked on the door to announce dinner but he ignored the interruption.  Finally he got up, turned on the lights and walked over to the dresser and its mirror. And stared at the hunky teen that looked back at him.  He had stood like this, countless times in the past few weeks, but this time instead of the grinning carefree face, which had smiled back at him before, the face was troubled and sad.  His eyes worked their way down to the muscular neck flanked by thick traps that flared into his shoulders.  The heavily muscled but defined shoulders that accented the bulk of his upper arms where the individual muscle bundles that formed the triceps and biceps could be clearly seen.  And below that were thick sinewy forearms and large strong hands.  His relaxed arms forced out from his body by the wings of his lat muscles that with his obliques tapered into his trim waist and hips giving his torso an impressive V-taper.  At the top of the V, the twin slabs of hard muscle of the pecs.  And below the cobblestones of 8-pac abs as they lead into his shorts where they met the bulge of his ample manhood.  His eyes continued down to the quads where his low body fat allowed the display of the muscle articulation as if looking at an anatomy chart.  And he continued down to the cleft diamonds of the calves.  This was the body that Rob had dreamed of having, Peter had gotten it perfect when he had reached into Rob’s mind for the model for the new Rob.  <br />
<br />
Rob abruptly turned his back to the mirror and took a few steps away from it.  He stared at the floor, shook his head and beat a few times on his quad with his clenched fist.  He could not, would not give up this body and go back to the old Rob.  He was happy in this life he was popular, guys liked him and there were girls that like him.  Some of the girls and few guys just wanted this body, but most saw him as a good looking guy with confidence and a unique attitude toward the world, and some were really nice people that wanted to get to know him.  “This life has a future where I wouldn’t be alone all the time and other people want to interact with me.  In the old life I was only existing, but in this life I have a real life.  I can’t go back to what I was.  But I still don’t want to hurt my family.  And for me to just disappear would hurt them deeply.  There had to be an answer.  I could get Peter to wipe the existence of the old Rob from their memories, if you don’t remember having something you can’t feel bad about losing it.  But there would still be traces to deal with and I would know.  Could Peter remove all trace of the old Rob from the world, and if he did how would that affect the world?  And still I would know, could I live with that?  There really was only one choice and that is to face them, and tell them I’m going to stay like this.  But how do I tell them?”  Rob start to pace the floor and shortly there’s a knock on the door.  “Dustin and I would like to come in Rob, if that’s alright” said Peter.  Rob stops pacing and lets them in  “Not that I really have much choice if you really want in there not much I could do to keep you out,” Rob says with a forced grin as his two friend step into the room.  “If you don’t want us we’ll go,” says Dustin. “No, that’s okay, I’ve worked out what to do and I’m working on the how to do it now,” Rob says with a somewhat more genuine smile.  “Dustin told me about what happened at the gym,” Said Peter.  “The way your mood shifted I was concerned I’d never seen you get like that before, since you’ve been with us you been smiling and upbeat,” said Dustin as Rob returned to the bed and stretched. “And I took a peak inside your head just to see if there was anything we could do to help,” said Peter as he sat down on the side of the bed.  Dustin pulls up a chair and sits. Rob props himself up on one elbow grins and says “You know Peter they arrest people for peeking in windows, peeking in someone’s head is a worse invasion of privacy,” he gives Peter a playful kick in the rear, “but I forgive you because you meant well.”  “We know about your family now and that you don’t want to hurt them by just disappearing and that you aren’t sure if they will believe, accept and approve of the new you, that’s where Peter decided you needed to work this out on your own,” said Dustin smiling slightly.  “When we came in you said that you know what to do, if you tell us what you decided we may be able to help you workout how to do it,” said Peter.  “Well, first of all I have decided that I need to tell my folks the truth that this is who I’m now,” Rob says and point at his chest with his hand.  “And second, this” and Rob says repeating the gesture “is Rob from now on.  I am not going back to my old life regardless of what my folks or anyone else think.  Which means, if it’s okay with you guys, you will have me hanging around for sometime to come.”  Dustin jumps out of the chair with a big grin on his face and gives Rob a bear hug, saying, “That’s great!”  Peter reaches over and pats Rob on the shoulder and says, “Good choice, I don’t think I could have put you back, to the way you where, anyways.” Peter grins, “Even if you did want to go back I was going to make you keep most of what you have now anyways.”  Rob grabbed Peter and pulled him into a group hug with Dustin an him, which quickly turned into a playful wrestling match. After a little while everyone was a bit sweaty and it was apparent no one wanted to win, so the three teens released their holds on each other.  Dustin return to the chair, Rob propped himself against the pillow and headboard in a sitting position and Peter to where he had been sitting near the foot of the bed.  Peter casually picked up one of Rob’s old yearbooks from the floor where it had fallen during the tussle and paged through it.  <br />
<br />
“But that leaves the question of how do I tell them that this,” again pointing his hand at his chest, ‘is their 52 year old son and have them accept it,” said Rob, “I suppose I could walk up to them and say ‘Hi Mom and Dad,’ but if by chance they did recognize me they would most likely freak.  “Well,” said Peter, “I changed you and even I can hardly see the old you in there,” he stops paging though the yearbook and turns it to show Rob’ and Dustin the page, “and there is no way I would guess that you and this or the same guy.” Peter points to the picture of Rob from the science fair his senior year.  Short chubby, even at his lowest high school weight, dressed in a dark sports jacket and tie, white shirt with gray slacks; with slightly slicked down hair, even for 1970, Rob was the poster boy for the chubby branch of science nerd boy.  “So I don’t think you need to worry about them recognizing you unless you start them thinking in that direction,” Peter continued.  “Agreed,” said Rob. “I see two options, 1) I meet them like I am now without them knowing I’m me and explain that their son is alright and happy, etc and then start them down a path where they will figure out the this is the new me, 2) you put me back to a me they will recognize and I explain and we top it off with me morphing back to the way I am now.”  “The second would be more dramatic and would for sure convince them,” Dustin noted.  “Maybe a little too dramatic,” said Rob, “It would need to be stage managed carefully.  I think the first option is the best plan and it should be as soon as possible.”  “I think you’re right,” said Peter,  “but even being told that you’re you, it is a bit of a stretch to believe, I did a fairly complete make over on you.” “I had thought about that,” Rob said, “I used to have a couple of scars and other defects that you removed in the process, thanks be the way,” Peter grins and shrugs his shoulders and Rob continued, “but if you put the scar back on my leg I think that would be enough to convince most any one the knew the old me.”  Peter nods his head and says, “Consider it done.”  Rob flinches with a brief pain and grabs at his leg.  “Oops, sorry, I guess I should have warned you first,” says Peter with a sheepish grim as he realizes what he had done. Rob looks at the ugly patch of disfigured skin that now covered most of what moments before had a the perfect well muscled calf that matched the rest of his awesome body.  Rob shakes his head and frowned briefly, the well formed muscle of his athlete’s calf was still there but a large patch of skin had change from the smooth tanned skin that covered the rest of his leg to a mottled pink, red and beige splotch that met the healthy skin in many radial puckers where more than 100 stitches had secured the skin graft over the hole left be the removal of a large possibly malignant mole when he was five.  He winched at the memory of the stitches being removed.  “I had forgotten it was quite as ugly as this when I was a kid,” said Rob, “by 50 it had healed to the point that at least the color match the rest of the leg most of the time.  This is the old Rob’s leg now with out doubt.  But when this is over we lose the scar again, okay?  It brings back too many bad memories that I want to forget.”  “No problem, I don’t want to see that around here either,” said Peter.  <br />
<br />
After discussing, for some time, how Rob should approach his parents and tell them that his life had taken an “unexpected turn,” that it forces a change in their relationship, and what that relationship can a should be; they agreed that Rob would call and make arrangements to meet with his parents at a public place.  Rob would go in the persona of a totally stud teen jock, and talk to them about Rob and what had happened to him.  Peter would be standing be to contain things if necessary. A plan in place the three teens head off to bed so they would be rested for what the morning would bring.<br />
<br />
Morning rolled around and as was the norm Ryan thundering down the back stairs for breakfast and cartoons meant it was time to get up.  Rob and Dustin had come down the front “stair,” started their oatmeal cooking and, as had become part of their morning routine, they were racing up the back stair that was scaled for Ryan’s adult height (as was most of the house) 40 feet high with risers almost three foot high, for an average size human it combine stair-climbing with hurtles for a very respectable though unorthodox workout.   Peter and Ty came down the front stair. (The front stair was not a stair in the conventional sense of the word, it consisted of a pair of shimmering archways one on each floor; when you entered one archway you exited the other.) Ryan joined the others in the kitchen.  Peter poured Ryan his Lucky Charms and enlarged them to match Ryan’s size.  Dustin and Rob finished their race in a dead-heat and came flopping onto the kitchen floor laughing, each try to keep the other from entering first.  Dustin pulled the oatmeal out of the microwave and divided it into two bowls.  Dustin had started eating oatmeal with Rob as part of their training routine.  Both had built a couple of pounds of high quality muscle and lost some fat since they started training together.  Peter and Ty had both offered to grow it for them but they both already had outstanding builds, different but equally stunning in their own way.  Rob, as normal, was shirtless and displayed his extreme definition with near perfect proportions and symmetry; Dustin, wore a muscle T-shirt which showed off his powerful arms and shoulders, his muscles were thicker and bulkier and his frame was broader than Rob’s.  Neither Dustin nor Rob really cared about getting bigger or stronger than they were, instead they were working out for the joy that pushing their bodies to their limits gave them, and any gains they made were the result of their sweat and determination and not the intervention of their wizard brother or buddies.   Dustin outweighed Rob by nearly 30 pounds but they were still pretty evenly matched, where Dustin was a bit stronger, but Rob was quicker and more agile.  <br />
<br />
Rob called the number from the flyer he and Dustin had seen at the gym and was connected to his dad at a local hotel.  And Rob explained he had seen the flyer at the gym and did know Rob, and that he knew Rob was fine and happy.  And told them that Rob wanted him to meet with them to explain what had happened to Rob, before Rob saw them.  Rob explained he wanted to meet them in a public place and suggested the mall, as it would be easy for them to find.  Confused by the request but anxious for information about their son, Rob’s parents agree to the meeting at the mall.  His dad ask how they would recognize each other to which Rob replied, “I’m about 17, 5’8” 150lb with short blond almost brown hair, but don’t worry I’ll recognize you.”  “But how…” said Rob’s dad.  Rob answered, “Well, a buddy and I were at the gym when you dropped of the flyer and Rob and I know each other pretty well… once I explain what has happened every thing should make sense.  So I’ll see you in an hour, near the center of the mall, okay?”  They say goodbye and hung up.  Rob looks at the rest of the guys and says, “I guess you heard show time is in an hour at the mall.  Peter will be near by to ensure things don’t attract attention.  And Dustin will go with me to meet them.  Once we get to the point where their Rob will come in, I think we’ll need some time alone to convince them I’m me, I’m happy and I want this.  If they can accept the new me and it makes sense, we’ll bring them over to meet all of you.  If they can’t, we wipe the whole incident and set an illusion that I’m still the old me from their point of view. And they call here from now on.  Well I guess we should head over we don’t wait to be late.  <br />
<br />
Dustin, Peter and Rob jump in the car and head for the mall.  When they get to the mall, Dustin and Rob make their way to the center, and Peter hangs back out of sight incase Rob wants his help.  As Rob and Dustin approach the center Rob sees his folks about half down the wing opposite the one Dustin and he had taken.  As Rob’s folks approach the mall center Rob waves to them and he and Dustin jog over to meet then.  Extending his hand Rob says, “Hi, I called you… and this is my buddy Dustin.  I want you to know Rob will be here in a few minutes but he wanted us to talk to you first.  He’s fine, no better than fine, he’s happier than he has been in years.”  “And healthier,” chimed in Dustin.  “True,” Rob continued, “but he has been through a lot over the last month… you might say he’s a completely different person now then he was when you last saw him.” Dustin unsuccessfully suppresses a chuckle and Rob continues, “He’s lost a lot of weight and feels and looks great, when taken as a whole he not sure you would accept and understand the change and he thinks you might not recognize the ‘new Rob’.”  “I think we can recognize our son,” says Rob’s dad and his mom seconds that opinion.  Rob turns to Dustin and says, “I guess we’re ready for Rob now Dustin.” Dustin replies, “Okay, I’ll be with Peter if you need us Rob.”  And Dustin walks away leaving the three alone.  After Dustin was out of earshot, Rob turns back to his parents and with a sheepish half smile says, “Hi mom and dad, I told you this would be hard to accept but is this me in here.  Jaws dropped and heads shook.  I know this is a shock for you it was for me too, believe me.  And Rob explains his chance meeting with Peter and the events of the next evening and working out with Peter and Dustin, and his shock at the end of the workout seeing the new Rob staring back at him from the mirror.  It was obvious that his parents were having trouble with the idea that the teenage boy that stood in front of them was their 52 year-old-son.  “I really tried to find a reason to go back but I want this!!! Physically I’m the person I’ve always wished I was and I can do high school and college again and the things I missed the first time because I was so unsure of myself and in fear all the time,” soon Rob lost the thread he had rehearsed and began to ramble, recounting his feelings and reasons for wanting to stay in his new life, his parent became aware of the incongruity of what was being said and the hunky athletic teen stud that was saying it and was near tears now.  “And I have the scar from the skin graft,” Rob babbled on, showing them the ugly patch on his left calf.  And his mom reaches out for his hand saying, “Robby is this really you??”  Still babbling Rob doesn’t hear her and when she touches his hand Rob briefly recoils and she says, “It is you.”  And she grasps his hand.  His dad, still not fully accepting the events, stared at Rob ‘side-ways’ and says, “Rob???”  His mother’s grip on his hand pulls Rob out of his stream of consciousness and he replies to both of his parents, “Yeah, I told you a lot had happened and I wasn’t the same person anymore.  In this case that wasn’t overstating things.  Peter says this is about what I would have been at 17 if I had been more of a jock along the way.  What I thought I should be and what I could have been weren’t all that much different.”  “Both you and ‘Dustin?’ mentioned a ‘Peter?’ who is he,” asked Rob’s dad.  “The a story in itself, I’ll introduce you later, but for now he’s a kid ‘my new age’ that has incredible power, he did this,” Rob said, “Apparently there are others like him and they call themselves “Transformation Wizards.”  He has a “mentor” that is training him on how to use his power but the mentor has others students and I was the right person at the right place at the right time and I got tapped to be a live-in advisor to Peter.  I guess I was a good guy that needed a break and was available.  It’s a chance to have a real impact on the future of the world.  Not all of these guys are benevolent like Peter and his mentor.  Some want world domination and don’t think much of the normal people like us.  So helping to keep Peter from straying to the ‘dark-side’ seems to be a good idea and the fringe benefits are nice.”  “We had hope you’d get a break for a change pal, but this is a little hard to accept,” said Rob’s dad.  “Yeah, it is a lot to accept all at once but if you can accept that I’m your Rob, the rest sort of falls in place behind it I think,” said Rob.  “This will take some getting use to,” said mom, “but I’m starting to be able to see you under that hair and the muscles.”  “That is quite a build you’ve got pal,” said dad.  “Yeah, part what I could have been if I had made some different choices and part a picture I saw on the Internet.  I ended up as one very well built stud, but that was the idea, me the way I’ve always wanted to be.  If you guys have accepted that I’m me why don’t I introduce you to Peter and the rest of the crew,” said Rob, “but I need to warn you I’m not the only one you will find hard to accept.”  Rob waves for Dustin and Peter to join them.  The two teens jogged over and Rob made introduction, “You’ve met Dustin, he is Peter’s cousin, he owns the house we live in and is my main gym partner these days.  This is Peter, who is responsible for my ‘new look.’  They both are really the teens they appear to be.  Guys this is my mom and dad.”  Peter extends his hand and says, “You seen to be too young to have had a 52-year-old-son, but since you don’t have a 52-year-old-son say 15 years less may be a bit better,” and he regresses Rob’s parent 15 years each, “and your back and your diabetes shouldn’t be a problem any more either. And lets get rid of that scar for good now.”  “Peter we agreed you would warn people before you modified them,” said Rob seeing that he once again two perfect calves.  “But I did, 5 seconds to be exact,” said Peter.  Rob shakes his head and says, “Okay, we were going to head home and introduce my folks to Ty and Ryan.”  Before another word could be said, the five of them found themselves standing in the living room of the house.  Rob looks at his parents and says, “Peter is having fun.”  Turning to Peter he asked. “Peter would you, without ‘zapping’ them here, ask Ty and Ryan to join us.”  “When you see Ryan, you’ll understand the dimensions of the room and you’ll see that I’m not really odd here.”  Ty strolls in, munching on an apple, and Rob introduces him between a series of earth-shaking thuds, “This is Ty, Dustin’s brother and Peters cousin.  He a wizard too but Peter is a bit more powerful.  An those thuds are Ryan, Peters adopted 9 year old brother.”  With a final thud Ryan was towering over the group. “Ryan these are my parents” Ryan smiled and said a bashful hello and added, “Allen called for you Peter almost an hour ago to said he would be over in an hour.”  Concerned that Allen Inflating Peter to the delight of Ryan would be a bit too much for his folk on the first visit Rob says, “Peter or Ty can you get my folks and me back to the mall I don’t think they’re ready for Allen yet.”  “Sure, no problem I was going to head over there anyways,” Ty answers with his mouth half full of apple, and the four find themselves standing in a concealed area near the dumpsters outside the mall.  “Need anything else, Rob?” Ty asks still munching on the apple.  “No, I don’t think so, thanks Ty,” says Rob. “I understand your wanting to bug out of there, put Allen together with Peter and Ryan and things get crowded fast, Ryan is a crowd all by himself,” Ty adds.  “No kidding!  We should be ok on your own Ty,” says Rob.  “Okay cool,” answers Ty, “I’m headed for the music store, I’ll probably be there for an hour or so if out need me,” and Ty tosses the remains of the apple in the dumpster and headed for the mall entrance.<br />
<br />
I’m sorry about that, things aren’t working out quite as I intended and I think you have enough to sort out for now.  We don’t general make it a habit to travel like that.  Dustin and I are just regular people like you so we can’t.  When we do it’s generally between alleys and near dumpster, so as not to attract attention.  Peter can mask stuff, from being generally observed so it’s unlikely that any one saw Peter’s little demonstration earlier.  You saw the real Ryan, but most people see Ryan as a regular 9 year old.  If Peter had let us drive over to the house you would know where it is and that it’s very normal looking from the outside and Peter can mask things that they can appear normal inside.  It can get to be a bit frantic at times.  If you want we can drive back over there, while write down the address and phone number for you.  I’m going to stay with the guys and I’m going to pretty much close out my old life and start a new one here.  I’m still figuring out this new wrinkle in the world, but so far I’m happier than I can ever remember being.  I think this is my break.  It’s nothing like we had ever imagined, but it seems like it will be one fantastic ride.  I hope you can understand.  Rob’s folks say it was a lot to absorb but they would try.  And Rob directed them out to the house.  They got out, said their goodbyes and hugged.  As his folks walked back to the car Rob grinned and said, “Next year you’ll have a long-lost nephew or an extra grandson at Christmas.”  Rob waved as they drove away and once they were out of site he turned smiled and went into the house to find out what chaos was happening now.  One thing was for sure his new life would always be interesting.<br />
<br />
With his decision to start a new life with Peter, Dustin and Ty, Rob with Peters help arranged for Rob’s disappearance and a buff tanned 18 year old with short spiky blond hair appeared with powers of attorney and other documents permitting him to act on Rob’s behalf the papers identify the teen as Robert Karlowski a close friend of Rob’s though no one had heard of or seen him before he showed up to give notice on Rob’s apartment and at Rob’s work.  The buff teen supervised the removal of Rob’s effect from both his apartment and his office.  And the teen had arranged to bring suit against Rob former employer to collect the back pay owed Rob and damages for disability from mental and emotional stress caused there treatment of Rob that had caused him to have a breakdown.<br />
