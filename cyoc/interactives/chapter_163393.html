<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Might as well have some fun and let the bartender pick.&quot; Edwin said as Mark set down the menu.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same for me.&quot; Mark nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great I&#39;ll be back with those in a moment, and if you need staff for anything, there&#39;s a call button on the table right there.&quot; The woman motioned to the same table between the two lounge chairs that held the menus.<br />
<br />
As soon as she was off, Mark stood up and began to strip out of his clothes. Edwin was a bit reluctant now that he was here, his eyes following the nude people walking along the beach. Why should he be bothered? He had a killer body now. So he stood and began to undress as well.<br />
<br />
He did notice a few people slowing to watch the pair of them strip, and felt self conscious again until he noticed most of the looks were.. appreciative. Edwin resisted the urge to cover himself up and sat down on the lounge chair. Mark waved a winked at a few of the passerbys, practically posing before finally taking his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re enjoying yourself.&quot; Edwin said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned at his friend as he folded his hands together behind his head. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I be, I got a hot body, the beach is awesome, and my best friend is here. I thought I was going to be stuck on a lame vacation with my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
A tray with two drinks appeared on the table between them, but not carried by the woman that was there before. &quot;Gentlemen, I wanted to bring these over myself, since you let me pick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin looked up at the bartender, he was probably the same age as Edwin and Mark were at the moment. He was tanned from working at the beach, and his hair was a deep auburn. Either the hotel had a lot of ridiculously good looking staff, or they made sure the best looking ones worked this beach. He had on tan shorts, but his white polo hugged his sculpted torso. He grinned at both of them as he motioned at the drinks.<br />
<br />
One was an orange colored slush in a pineapple, the other was pale orange and served in a tall glass. &quot;So.. what are they? And which one is mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would spoil the surprise, and while you could drink either, I&#39;d recommend the pineapple one for you. Not much about you needs changing.&quot; The bartender smiled brightly. &quot;Oh, and my name is Bruno if you need anything.&quot; For some reason he tapped a piece of paper on the tray and winked at Edwin before heading off.<br />
<br />
Edwin shrugged and grabbed the pineapple, though Mark snatched at the piece of paper. &quot;Dude.. I think he was hitting on you.&quot; Slurping through the straw, Edwin arched his brow. Mark turned the piece of paper to let Edwin see it. &quot;Phone number.&quot; He laughed and set the piece of paper back on the tray as he grabbed the other drink, humming softly after taking a sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not really my type. Flattering though.&quot; Edwin said as he sipped some more of his drink from the pineapple, watching the water.. and perhaps a few of the women walking along the beach.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed. &quot;C&#39;mon, maybe you should explore a little, that&#39;s the point of vacations right, experience new things?&quot; <br />
<br />
Edwin arched an eye brow and looked over at Mark, then his brows shot up. &quot;Dude.. I think it&#39;s taking affect, your hair is looking a little.. red.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark grabbed a lock of his long hair and pulled it to where he could see it, the orange color soaking into it, then looked down and ran his fingers through his chest hair. &quot;Well, damn. You don&#39;t look any different though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin shrugged. Though Mark was looking good with that fiery coloring coming in. In fact, freckles were starting to form across his nose and shoulders as he paled just a little. Edwin grabbed the menu and scanned it. &quot;Ginger Whiskey, see what it&#39;s like as a fiery redhead. Well, it kind of suits you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Mark said, scratching at his now orange beard. His chest hair making his pectorals look like they were on fire. &quot;Still nothing different on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin shook his head with an amused smile as he resumed people watching. Though he found himself looking at more than just the women. Some of the men were pulling his attention, too. Maybe it was thinking about the bartender hitting on him and what Mark said. Trying something new.<br />
<br />
He looked over at Mark, and even felt a little swelling in his cock as he did so. Quickly he looked away. His drink gave off a slurp as he finished it off, peering into the pineapple with a frown. He looked over to Mark to say something but he was already up. &quot;I&#39;m going to get us two more drink, Bruno&#39;s choice again..&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin grabbed the piece of paper off the tray and tucked it into the pocket of his folded up shorts. Couldn&#39;t hurt to have. Though as Mark headed over to the bar, Edwin found himself staring at his friend&#39;s ass. He&#39;d never thought about it before, but..<br />
<br />
He shook his head in an effort to clear it. &quot;Crap.. what was in that drink.&quot;</p>
