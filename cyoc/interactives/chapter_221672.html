<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the sound of her mother&#39;s voice, Brittany whirled her body around and began to run towards the designated house, blowing past the muscle-swapped woman and man, drawing the attention of the women with their heads mounted onto their wrists, and startling a few other people as she thundered up the porch, almost knocking over the tall mutant woman with the eight breasts and eight arms.<br />
<br />
The cyclopean girl with the tentacle limbs worriedly gazed in your direction as Brittany brushed past many mutants in the crowded entryway to the house.  Brittany&#39;s neighbor&#39;s gardener, now a curvaceous, many-breasted, pregnant woman, struggled to make room for Brittany as she squeezed past him/her and another mutant you hadn&#39;t seen yet.<br />
<br />
You took a look at the middle-aged woman as a transfixed Brittany passed by - she had a thicker coat of body hair than the average person and interestingly was missing a head on the top of her body - at the top of her neck was a large pair of full, young, upward-facing lips.  Out of them lolled a long, sexy, pink tongue the licked the lips periodically and flicked sexually at the air.  Her head had a circumcised penis at its base - testicles and all - and it was lodged between her evidently expanded cleavage that she tried to cover with a scarf - a strategy the only partially worked. The middle-aged woman was carrying a box of lighting supplies and batteries with the pair of bony tentacles that had replaced her lower arms <br />
By the way it looked glisteningly wet and was dripping pre-ejaculate (a stain was forming on her dress), and because the woman was red-faced, sweating, and despite her best efforts, walking a bit tipsy, you took a quick guess and figured that the woman had experienced a few unwitting male orgasms with her neck-penis, with the help of the sucking lips and enticing tongue.<br />
You also figured, seeing how the woman&#39;s stiff demeanor contrasted heavily with the carnal sucking and licking actions of the mouth and tongue on her neck, that she did not control their actions either.<br />
<br />
Brittany nearly also bumped into a group of people hauling two unfortunate individuals who had turned into immobile pieces of essentially human &quot;furniture&quot; - both were donned in yoga clothing.<br />
An untransformed teenage boy (brown-haired, athletic, looks better than you, sadly) was carrying one, and a pair of conjoined twin girls (both athletic also and clearly not related, but fused at the hip - their touching legs having merged into one, giving them three to share) was heaving the other.<br />
The &quot;living chair&quot; that the boy was carrying was a tall but squatting woman performing a yoga &quot;chair pose&quot; - though she was thrusting her chest outward and upward.  Her legs and feet, in a squatting position, had fused together, becoming the base of the &quot;chair&quot; she had become, while her breasts had expanded to form a large, jiggly but comfortable cushion - between the breasts sat her enlarged vagina and anus.  As for her upstretched arms, they were distended and curved into a nice, form-fitting backrest.  Her head had rotated backwards so that it could rest the right-side up.  She didn&#39;t look too happy, and as the boy carried her, the huge cushion of her breasts, resting on her head, wobbled greatly.  From the fragment of conversation that you caught, you discovered that the boy and the stool-woman were mother and son.<br />
The &quot;living chair&quot; that the conjoined girls were cradling with their four arms was different - it was a short woman stuck in a &quot;upwards forward fold pose&quot;, buttocks in the air, stomach and chest dropped, head looking upward.  Her inflated buttocks served as the &quot;cushion&quot; while her distended, now backwards-facing upper torso , served as the &quot;backrest&quot;, her already moderately large breasts serving as upper cushions.  Her legs had become fused with her arms as her feet had fused to her hands, creating two stabilizing, rear triangle-shaped legs of the &quot;recliner&quot; she had become, while a huge, 3 foot-long and 5-inch thick penis that had erupted from her crotch performed as a third &quot;leg&quot; of the &quot;chair&quot;.<br />
From what you heard, the two conjoined girls, hobbling with their three shared legs, were the best friends of the &quot;chair-ified&quot; woman.<br />
<br />
<br />
You were trying your best to try to get Brittany to calm down and take it slowly, but you could hear her mind frantically racing - nothing was stopping her.<br />
<br />
This was at least until Brittany, following the sound of her mother&#39;s voice, collided with a mutant girl you hadn&#39;t seen yet.  She barely caught you and Brittany and stopped herself from falling over by firmly planting her disproportionately huge and thick legs and buttocks that dwarfed her normal body size. <br />
You were apologizing and being courteous, asking the now-irritated girl if she was all right, when Brittany shot her hands up to your face in shock and gave the girl a huge hug - according to her, the girl was Diane, a close friend. <br />
The girl was confused and a bit unsure of what to make of the situation when you, over Brittany&#39;s mental weeping and jumbled instructions, managed to explain the situation more smoothly than you had with Gina.  You even gave proof, showing Diane Brittany&#39;s phone. <br />
The girl eased up a bit as you explained to her the situation, giving Brittany (and you) a deep hug, rubbing your shared back, until you mentioned your name.<br />
Diane&#39;s sweaty but momentarily relaxed face dropped and went pale as she backed up with a worried expression, looking away nervously.<br />
<br />
Diane stood roughly 5 feet, 6 inches tall - her face was attractive and kind, her features fit and thin, and her curvy torso was now decked with three large, firm but jiggling breasts (in a horizontal row).  Other than that transformation, her entire upper body (from the waist up), seemed to be of normal proportions.  Below the unnaturally wide waist sat a massive, shaved, shiny and thick pair of buttocks and legs.  Diane&#39;s waist was twice as wide as her torso, her buttocks as large as small tires, and her legs at least 5 inches curvy and thick.<br />
Shifting uncomfortably, Diane was wearing a loose brown V-neck long-sleeved shirt and a sweater vest on top, as well as a long cooking apron that covered her entire front body. Though it was understandable that no article of clothing could fit Diane&#39;s magnificent backside and undersides, curiously, she wore know towel or bathrobe that concealed her behind, leaving its thick magnificence on display to the world.<br />
<br />
You were getting nervous.  Had Diane seen you dreaming about Brittany at school?  Had you actually made it that obvious?<br />
No.  You hadn&#39;t.  It was impossible!  You had kept your dreams about Brittany walled up and entirely secret, leaving as few visual, verbal, or physical cues as possible.  As far as the world knew, you and Brittany were, or had been, just friendly classmates!<br />
Something else, perhaps?<br />
<br />
You were right - a deeper voice coming from behind Diane gently urged her to &quot;show&quot; you and Brittany - that you had the right to know.<br />
Incredibly curious but cautious, Brittany backed your shared body up slightly as Diane quietly whispered &quot;sorry . . .&quot; as she turned around.<br />
Two large, masculine eyes sat on Diane&#39;s exposed ass, one on each, and between them sat, instead of an anus, a sideways-facing mouth, jammed into the asscrack.  Like a tail, above the asscrack sat a short, stubby, and turgid penis.  Equipped with a condom, it shook just like a  tail as Diane turned around.<br />
The mouth smiled and spoke in a most familiar voice to YOU.<br />
&quot;Hey man . . .&quot; - it said.<br />
Your brother&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
A quick explanation revealed that your older brother had been dating Diane for 2 years now, in secret.  They were such an odd match - your brother&#39;s grungy and sharp, punkish attitude was in stark contrast to the light, smart, and bubbly personality of Diane that Brittany swore to you she was familiar with.  For this reason, they kept the relationship quiet.<br />
Diane, ashamed, showed you and Brittany the hundreds of photos and videos they had taken together.  They looked happy.<br />
They had fused together while your brother had laid his head on Diane&#39;s lap as they were studying for their upcoming exams and talking about school life - and now your brother was stuck, helpless, as her ass.<br />
You asked for Brittany to step forward, which she did before hugging a crying Diane.  You whispered to her that it was all right - that your brother typically was an ass anyway (bringing forth a quiet chuckle) - and that you were glad that they could be together forever, telling her that your brother had become a nicer person since meeting her.<br />
After asking an important but sensitive topic, Diane and your brother revealed, with relief, that your brother&#39;s oddly placed mouth did not serve as their body&#39;s anus - it had simply moved forward, sitting just behind their vagina.<br />
<br />
As you were chatting, Brittany&#39;s mother and sister walked into the room.</p>
