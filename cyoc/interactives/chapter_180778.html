<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick stretched out on the bed. It took him a moment to recognize the unfamiliar room, much less the unfamiliar body. He ran a hand over the short bristly hairs on his meaty pec and smiled. Oh, Jason, this was going to be fun. He rolled over, expecting to still see Anthony in the bed with him but the guy was gone. Instead, Jason&#39;s cell phone sat there.<br />
<br />
There were a couple of texts but there was one at the top. &#39;I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you. -A&#39;<br />
<br />
Nick grinned a little, thinking of having another round with Anthony, though who know if he&#39;d be in the same body next time. Nick found that thought even more exciting. He looked around the room with a bit of a frown, however. If he was going to spend any time at all as Jason, he was going to have to do something about this mess. He took the next hour walking around his new room naked, sorting clothes and throwing the dirty ones in the hamper, tossing out old food wrappers and just generally tidying up. The room was still a bit crazy at the end, but he felt better about it. Maybe he could leave Jason with a few good habits, too.<br />
<br />
Stretching his arms over his head, he caught a whiff of himself and cringed. Shower next. He grabbed his towel and was about to tie it around his waist then stopped, and instead just threw it over his shoulder. One part of his plan was to have Jason wear as little as possible. Turn him into a bit of an exhibitionist. He wouldn&#39;t walk out into that frat house naked in his own body, but this wasn&#39;t his body. So he stepped out of his room, dick swinging in front of him and walked to the bathroom. He thought nobody was going to spot him until the bathroom door opened in front of him and another jock he recognized as Ryan from Jason&#39;s memories stepped out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Ryan said, staring down at Jason&#39;s naked form. &quot;Cover up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick just stepped around Ryan, giving him a cocky smirk. &quot;Not like you haven&#39;t seen it in the locker room, you&#39;re just jealous.&quot; That left Ryan with nothing to say in return as Nick closed the bathroom door behind him. A hot shower was just what he needed, a chance to lather up and explore his new body with his hands. It really was unfair how hot Jason was, like god had made him the perfect body then dropped the ball when giving him a personality.<br />
<br />
His soapy hand eventually wrapped around his cock and he started pumping away. Which could Nick have been given a tool like this? All his shortcomings and he had only been just about average in this department, too. But did it matter anymore? He could go back to his old life, but from what Anthony said, he could just live a new life hoping body to body, or linger in one body for years. He could spend the next ten years as Jason if he wanted.<br />
<br />
The thought had his cock twitching in his hands. He reached around with his other hand and prodded at his hole with soapy fingers. It wasn&#39;t ideal and he mentally added another couple of items to today&#39;s shopping list. But he wanted to reinforce certain things, so having fingers in his ass when he came was needed. He shot his load on the shower wall and quickly let the water rinse it off. After quickly drying off he walked back to his bedroom, towel over his shoulder like before. He got a few stares from a couple of this frat bros who were just waking up, but ignored them.<br />
<br />
He got dressed in the skimpiest clothes he could find. A tank top with a low enough neck and thin enough shoulders that it showed off most of his chest, and a pair of shorts that were just a little on the too short side. A pair of sandals on his feet, and then he was grabbing his wallet, keys, and phone to head to the mall. He knew Jason&#39;s family had given him a card with almost cart blanche to buy what he wanted. He was their golden child and they had money. Nick intended to use it.<br />
<br />
His first stop was for some new clothes. Some of Jason&#39;s wardrobe was fine, but he needed to add some.. kink. Jason already had a few stringer tank tops like the one Nick was wearing now, but he grabbed a few fishnet shirts, sleeveless and not, and even a crop top one. Tight jeans, shorter shorts, and even a pair of leather pants and a leather vest found their way into Nick&#39;s basket. He just grabbed a bunch of thongs and threw them in as well. He spent some time trying them on in the fitting room, posing in front of the mirror, and even stepping out into the store once or twice to get the clerk&#39;s opinion. He got the opinion, and his phone number. He even took a picture of himself in the outfit to put on a hook up app later.<br />
<br />
The second stop was at a sex store. Nick had never been in one himself, and hesitated a little before stepping inside. He shot the young woman at the counter a smile. He could feel Jason&#39;s libido stirring, she was attractive, but he stomped on it. &quot;No, no more women for you Jason.&quot; He thought. He made sure that none of his looks or smile would even come off as slightly flirty. Lube and a dildo were at the top of the list, but a set of butt plugs were grabbed next, along with a leather harness and collar.<br />
<br />
Nick had long ago come to terms with his sexuality. This was going to be a little hard for him considering he considered himself a top. Also why he&#39;d never found anyone, the small, lanky top wasn&#39;t something many guys went for. But he wanted to have Jason go full bottom, which meant exploring something he hadn&#39;t considered much. Still, he knew what he was going to need to do to poor Jason, and maybe he&#39;d enjoy it in the end. Even if he was having Jason bottom, it was because Nick wanted him to.<br />
<br />
He returned to the frat house in good spirits. As soon as he was back up in his room he started the final item on his checklist. He took photos of himself in his new outfits, most from the neck down, and then downloaded a hook up app. Thirty minutes later HockeyBottom was a new user with a whole gallery of scantily clad muscle pics. He considered shaving his chest, but he thought the well-trimmed hair was a nice touch.<br />
<br />
He reached up and rolled one of his nipples between his fingers. He wondered if his ability to control his body included making it heal faster. A set of nipple rings would be a perfect addition to Jason&#39;s chest. He picked up his phone to text Anthony that question just as he got his first hit on the hook up app. Two more came quickly after. Looks like he wasn&#39;t going to be alone tonight.</p>
