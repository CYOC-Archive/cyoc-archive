<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth Harper returned with Lisa Jenkins to find her family gathered around a long table and effectively waiting for her. Also there were the rest of the Jenkins family and a young woman that she didn&#39;t recognize. She&#39;d seen many of the Jenkins when they came to the hospital after James Harper Sr. had his heart attack and saw them again when she arrived at the Jenkins home, which looked rather nice, but the woman she saw was some one new. She looked older than Harry Jenkins, but not by too terribly much and she sat next to the older son, Huck, who she had recently learned had been shot as part of Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s attempt to claim Jenny as his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we&#39;re a bit late,&quot; Lisa spoke, &quot;Mrs. Harper noticed a few old family photos in the hall and asked about them. So... I briefly took her through one of the old family albums.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things went well, I hope,&quot; Henry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Lisa answered as she moved to sit beside her husband while Elizabeth sat down at the other end of the table and opposite Henry. To Elizabeth&#39;s right was Betty, the woman Elizabeth didn&#39;t recognize, and to her left was Harry, Jenny&#39;s wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a lovely family,&quot; Elizabeth said slowly and weakly, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry that Dieter gave you such trouble...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Henry answered.<br />
<br />
There was a brief moment of silence before those at the table started eating. James Junior, John, and Janice were a bit hesitant, but did join in. The only one who looked a bit puzzled was Elizabeth. Eventually her own puzzlement was expressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No prayer before dinner?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our prayers are private,&quot; Henry answered, &quot;and given silently. There is no rule that says it HAS to be voiced. And besides, I&#39;m a Methodist and Lisa is Catholic. It wouldn&#39;t be fair to her to impose anything on her and it would be fair to me to go the other way. So we pray silently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t expect every family&#39;s habits at the dinner table to mirror yours and dad&#39;s, mom,&quot; James Jr. told her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth backed down, &quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone there noted the submissive tone to it and noticed a sigh come from James Junior. He&#39;d told Henry and Lisa about what had seemed to go on while he&#39;d been with her before at the hospital the previous day and his concerns on that. He&#39;d also voiced the same concerns to Jenny with regard to finding a way to get their mother to think more independently, especially if the hospital in Moon Lake ultimately intended to transfer James Harper Sr. to a hospital in Alabama to suit his insurance company&#39;s position before the angioplasty was done. That would require to Elizabeth to think independently because James Harper Sr. wouldn&#39;t be able to actually act in a way that would allow him to provide for the two of them on his own.<br />
<br />
Jenny saw this and looked to Harry for a moment before looking back to her brother who looked a bit downcast by it. She was certain that that wasn&#39;t quite what he wanted. He might have to manipulate it in order to expedite the process of transferring John and Janice to Jenny and Harry&#39;s care, but that wouldn&#39;t necessarily make for an easy transfer of independence for Elizabeth. When Jenny took her eyes away from her brother she noted Huck and Betty looking with some puzzlement to Henry, who was making a low wave to them as if to say, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
And from there the dinner moved quietly into something that was rather tense in a way. In her present state and as a guest in someone else&#39;s home, Elizabeth didn&#39;t want to make a scene, though she did wonder how or why Jenny&#39;s bust and hips had grown so greatly in the months since coming to Moon Lake. Jenny and Harry didn&#39;t want to start an argument either, and while Betty and Huck were a bit surprised by the submissiveness that Elizabeth had shown so far to James Junior, Elizabeth Harper was still very new to them personally and they didn&#39;t want do anything that might provoke a fight. Janice was quiet, as her great desire was to be a weremermaid and inquire into all the perks that being a were would entail from Jenny, but since Moon Lake&#39;s secret was to be kept she couldn&#39;t say anything. John was quiet as the point he&#39;d had the most to think about what he was to do. Huck told him it was okay if he was gay, and he seemed to get some odd vibe that Moon Lake was okay with that, but he still had to figure out what he wanted and that would take time and wouldn&#39;t do well to discuss it in front of his mother, who he knew had signed politically Conservative petitions intended to try and outlaw homosexuality.<br />
<br />
Eventually something did come up, even though it was more of a &quot;business&quot; nature than anything else. Jenny looked to her mover and softly cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom... I know this may not be something you want to hear... but it&#39;s still going to be something that needs to happen,&quot; Jenny spoke slowly, &quot;for John and Janice especially. Now, I will have college tomorrow, but I will look into what Washington State would look at with regard to the transfer of custody. Do they need full fledged emancipation or both yours and dad&#39;s consent or just your consent... or does it need to include legal decisions in Alabama as well. James Jr. will probably help on the Alabama end... but we may start here in Washington.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth looked up from her dinner and then looked to James, who only nodded. When he nodded, she sighed and then nodded as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Elizabeth eventually said.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the course of that there is someone here in Moon Lake I want you to meet,&quot; Jenny spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who...?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s therapist who has an office in the same ring that we&#39;re on now,&quot; Jenny answered, using the term used to apply for the central area of the town that had circular streets that formed the hub of Moon Lake&#39;s wagon wheel shape. &quot;Though her office is across the street from a pizza place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A therapist... I&#39;m not crazy!&quot; Elizabeth protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying you are,&quot; Jenny raised her hands, &quot;but she would be someone to talk to... if only for a short while... to help with all the stress that&#39;s gone on. Dieter&#39;s meddling and determination to take that which he had no right... and nearly killed one of my new in laws to do it. Dad&#39;s stress induced heart attack when he learned he wasn&#39;t in complete control over everyone... It&#39;s all stressful and I&#39;d think you&#39;d benefit to talk with someone who has no personal stake with the things that relate to John, Janice, or even you with regard to dealing with dad. You don&#39;t have to stay and commit to long term sessions... I&#39;d just like you to talk with her, at least once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her...&quot; Elizabeth said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Women can have jobs too,&quot; Lisa added into the conversation, &quot;I work  part time at the Safeway here in town as a cashier. It isn&#39;t much, but it does get me out of the house and allows for better prices on groceries there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I work at the construction company that Huck runs,&quot; Betty spoke, &quot;I handle more of the office work... but I know my way around tools and a workbench if the team is ever short a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck only smiled and took her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;A construction company?&quot; Elizabeth asked with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Jenkins Construction,&quot; Henry answered, &quot;I started while we lived down in Texas and were in an area that had a fair amount of construction needed. And for when actual services aren&#39;t needed... it has still served as a means to buy the material needed for a construction project in case one is a do it yourselfer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of it,&quot; Elizabeth said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were never super big,&quot; Henry gave a laugh, &quot;never in league with something the Home Depot or Lowes as hardware mega stores. And... in a way, when an opportunity opened here in Moon Lake, I sold the installation and services in Texas to my second in command and gave him permission to change the name as he became the new owner, and reestablished new offices here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still work?&quot; Elizabeth wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m at the age where the near constant construction work isn&#39;t really possible anymore,&quot; Henry spoke, &quot;and a lot of what I know is dated. I own the present company... but Huck is presently the man running it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds hard working,&quot; Elizabeth spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be,&quot; Huck nodded, &quot;but rewarding in that in either fixing or upgrading existing homes, building all new ones, or taking down an old structure to replace it with a new one helps people and they&#39;re usually pretty appreciative of doing that for them. And the fact that Betty works there, and has done well, is proof that women can work and in my mind do anything they want if truly given the chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why it&#39;s okay to see a woman therapist,&quot; Jenny cut back into the conversation, &quot;even if it&#39;s only something brief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Elizabeth said quietly after a few moments.</p>
