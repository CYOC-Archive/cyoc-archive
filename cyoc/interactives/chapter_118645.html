<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Genie, I wish that anytime I utter the magic words In Canis Corpore Transmuto, Nate will slowly turn from his ordinary eighteen year old self into a large Old English Sheepdog for an hour and then change back, but still have the ability to speak as a dog.&quot; Janie stood there smiling as she completed her wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted!&quot; announced Xander. &quot;Oh, this is going to be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...why?&quot; exclaimed Nate, not at all enthused that his best friend would now wield the power to transform him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m performing a magic act in the school talent show and I thought an act showing me transforming you in front of the whole school would be a lot more fun that the usual hokey tricks I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, those talent shows are always so hokey.&quot; Nate had to admit that would be a showstopper though. &quot;Alright, but how are you going to explain how you turned me, an average high schooler into a big, shaggy dog on a high school stage? And if we were going to do it, why not pick something cooler, like a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just say a magician never reveals their secrets and if they push me I&#39;ll say I have an uncle that works in Special Effects that helped me out.&quot; replied Janie &quot;As for the werewolf, we&#39;d need a full moon for that wouldn&#39;t we? Besides, you always made me watch those stupid Disney movies where the guy turns into a dog. This is my revenge.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well that might work.&quot; replied Nate.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So, yeah...I suppose we should clean this place up,&quot; said Janie. &quot;Then we can go and practice my magic act.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, cleaning up is easy enough,&quot; said Xander. &quot;Just wish for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? But you only gave me one wish?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;This would be a freebie,&quot; replied Xander.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I wish this prop room was sparkling clean and organized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted.&quot; The prop room became a flurry of activity as various prop items and costumes flew around the room, placing themselves on shelves and clothing hangers which then went onto the clothing racks. Within a few moments, everything was spic and span.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet, now we have the rest of our Saturday free.&quot; Janie looked around and saw how much of the floorspace had been opened up by the clean up and thought that this might actually make a good rehearsal space. &quot;Hey, you know what, this might be the perfect place to rehearse. Just let me check one thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janie stuck her head out the door and listened. Mr. Bergstrom was deep in rehearsal for the play he was putting on with the college kids so they would be left alone.  She closed the door and walked back over to Xander and Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, he&#39;s deep into rehearsal so we won&#39;t be disturbed for quite awhile. Shall we start?&quot; asked Janie.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, he had to admit that part of him was anxious to experience a real life human to animal transformation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so I&#39;d start of with a great beginning speech preparing the audience for the trick they were about to see and then introduce you as my assistant. Then you Nate will come out from the wings and take a spot next to me on the stage.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate walked over to where she was standing and stopped next to her. &quot;Then what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I say the magic words. You ready?&quot; asked Janie. Nate nodded. &quot;In canis corpore transmuto.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked over himself but didn&#39;t see any dramatic or sudden changes. &quot;Hey, what gives?&quot; He looked over to Xander shrugging his shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...oh Nate.&quot; whispered Janie. &quot;You are looking a bit grey. Check yourself out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate looked over to the full length mirror on the wall and his jaw dropped. Sure enough, shaggy strands of white, gray and black hairs were growing in over his usual dirty blond hair. He walked slowly towards it, watching the shaggy fur blossom over his hair and the sides of his face. His lips grew thinner and darker as his nose turned black and canine. He could feel the same fur growing all over his body as his body reformed into that of an unusually large dog. He watched as his hands became forepaws before being forced onto four paws. He felt his ears grow out and flop over as his face pushed out into a canine snout. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m a dog.&quot; muttered Nate as he checked out his reflection. &quot;This is actually happening.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janie laughed and Nate realized what it was, he was still wearing his clothes as they had been loose enough to adjust to Nate&#39;s transforming body. So, there in the middle of the prop room was a big shaggy dog wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans. His smaller canine paws easily stepped out of his shoes though.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, this is perfect actually.  Try walking over to me,&quot; instructed Janie. Nate walked over to her on all fours with ease, not feeling particularly restricted, although his pant legs were a big too long now. &quot;I think when we do the show, we&#39;ll have you wear shorts instead. It&#39;s warm enough though. Plus more of you to show off transforming.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate actually liked the sound of that. He couldn&#39;t wait for the talent show. Nate continued practicing walking on all fours, which he took to surprisingly naturally before lying down as watching Janie as she practiced what she was going to say. After the hour was up, Nate quickly shifted back to a human boy. He stood up on his two legs, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that was actually pretty fun.&quot; Nate then looked to Janie and scowled. &quot;Just so long as you never do it to me without my consent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janie gave him a coy smile. &quot;Now then, Xander, what are you going to do? Do you want to keep hanging with us, or what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I still owe Nate a wish so I think I will keep hanging with him if that&#39;s ok. Besides, I want to see this magic show of yours. It sounds like fun.&quot; replied Xander.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, we need to do something with your appearance. Can you transform to appear human or go invisible to everyone but us or something?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Xander&#39;s rabbit features shrank away until he was just a regular boy, not looking much older than Nate. He magically conjured up pants and t-shirt to wear under his vest. He picked up the top hat he was previously imprisoned in and stuck it on top his head. <br />
<br />
And with that, the three of them casually left the auditorium.</p>
