<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the mall atrium, Jim pulled out another cigarette and lit it, taking several deep drags.Damn it, where was Mr.Clarkson? Rick was happily walking with him, bags full of clothes and ready for a night of party.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck Jim, smoking is so gross! How are you supposed to get a girlfriend like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim puffed snidely in his direction and smiled almost snidely. &quot;Who said having a girlfriend was ever important?&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Rick burst into a fit of laughs, youthful voice bursting into a fit of giggles, streaked hair rocking back and forth. &quot;Oh Jim! If you had someone who loved you like Katie, you would underSTAND!&quot; voice cracking sharply.<br />
<br />
Jim nodded slowly, checking his texts. Nope, nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you're right Rick. Maybe I do need a girlfriend. How do I get a girl's attention?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Jim, she'll come to you! This is like, an awesome age to be a guy isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how do I know she's interested?&quot; Jim dragged harder, suppressing his urge to laugh at his naive friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;She'll give you a card, a gorgeous card! Remember the one Katie gave to me? I remember that day so well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I wanted one Rick, you know, to be a gentleman and all that, give her one to show that I'm a bang up guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Rick fell silent and began stroking his hair anxiously, eyes straying towards the fountain. Jim checked his texts again, no Mr.Clarkson! Little that Jim knew was that a certain honey-haired boy was entering a Hot Topic to get ready for an upcoming party...<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Rick, buddy 'ole pal. Don't you want me to be as happy as you? What are friends for?&quot; Jim flashed him a winning smile and he threw his cigarette into the fountain.<br />
<br />
Rick smiled back, perfect white teeth gleaming. &quot;You didn't hear it from me, but I heard Maddy talking to Katie about this once. But I can't remember much, I was soo lost in her eyes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim nodded his head, stifling a cough. Who was Maddy? He focused, thinking hard. Was she that weird girl? That girl who liked tacky clothes and old fashion? What could she possibly have to do with this?<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she going to the party?&quot; Jim put his hand on his lighter, stroking it. A stupid nervous habit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm, she told Katie and Tina about it during lunch. She said he was so dreamy. But Katie said I was the cutest boy she ever saw...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim nodded his head. Where was Mr.Clarkson? Where could he be? He tried calling him this time, but it went straight to voicemail. Weird, why was that happening?<br />
<br />
Jim waited for an hour, not catching Mr.Clarkson leave, his cute body fashionably adorned and riding down on a skateboard, waves of honey flowing in the breeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, we need to get ready for the party, I'm going to call a taxi and we can go to my house. I can grab my car and we can get Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded enthusiastically, following after Jim as the pair boarded the bus, getting off reasonably close to Jim's home(a twenty minute walk).<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I don't get dirty and sweaty, Katie would be so mad...&quot; Rick was noticeably concerned, even though it was sunset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep moving Rick, the faster we get to my house the faster we go to your party.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching Jim's plain home, he bolted inside. Good thing the parents were out playing Bridge. Rick made himself at home and plopped himself down on the couch, texting on his phone will Jim headed upstairs.<br />
<br />
Where was it? Where was it..<br />
<br />
There! Going through one of his pairs of pants, he found it! A hand mirror, palm-shaped and circular. And the other thing...<br />
<br />
Jim opened his desk and pulled out his sunglasses. And he pulled out his darkest shader. He saved that one for fishing, but if he wore it at night he's be practically blind. Jim muttered to himself &quot;I wear my sunglasses at night...I wear my sunglasses at night...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heading downstairs, Jim sprayed himself with some Axe to mask the cigarettes and saw Rick touching himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in my house Rick!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't help it&quot;, giggled Rick. &quot;Katie is soo perfect. I want to hold her so badly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim grunted and gestured towards the door, the pair leaving the house.<br />
<br />
Entering Jim's shitty car, he drove over to Katie's house, trying his hardest to keep Rick focused on giving him directions. What should of been a simple drive took twenty minutes longer, exasperating Jim and giving him such a craving for a smoke. But no, not now. Got to relax now. Pulling in front of Katie's home, Jim honks his horn, a feeble drone coming from an old car. But thankfully, she came.<br />
<br />
Man, Katie looked cuter than usual. Jim almost regretted not opening the note, but only for a split second. Entering the car, she giggles and immediately begins kissing Rick, the two locked tightly in embrace, exchanging sweet nothings. Jim tried to politely cough, but it came as more of a wheezing.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you two love birds are finished, could you please tell me where the party is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; giggled Katie. &quot;Maybe if you're lucky Jim, you can end up like us!&quot; She stared with adoration at Rick, stroking the smaller boys hair, planting a few pecks on his cheeks, the two smiling and giggling at each other.<br />
<br />
With the address finally in tow, Jim texted Mr.Clarkson. Frustrated at the lack of response, he called him. And this time he got an answer!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mr.Clarkson, where are you? I know where the party is, are you heading over there? Or do you want me to pick you up?&quot; Jim heard a soft laughing across the line, a delicate and soft boy's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Jim, I'm already there with my date Maddy! Come over, we'll have so much fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim's blood froze, hands trembling at the realization going through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-of c-course. I'll be there...&quot;<br />
<br />
A sweet laughter came over the line, along with another girl laughing as well. Disgusted, Jim hung up. He had to be vigilant now, anything could happen.<br />
<br />
Driving the pair to the party, Jim ran ideas through his head. Would be memorize an escape route? Would he keep the sunglasses on at all times or keep them as a surprise? He felt so tired...this wasn't his thing. He wasn't a hero he was just some unlucky bastard.<br />
<br />
Pulling up at the posh, upper-middle class home, Jim heard the booming bass of a party going on. He saw a relatively tall boy( for the blonde boys, at least) standing guard at the door. As Rick and Katie entered, Jim steeled himself for what had to happen next.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Maddy looked up from the second story window, seeing Jim exit the car. Yes, things were going quite well. She touched the envelope in her pocket. It was a special one, different from all the others. It was a lighter pink,glossier and sweeter. A soft and gentle design with a hint of lace. She had already signed it, but she pulled it out and kissed it for luck. Why keep herself with one boyfriend when she could have two? And she was CERTAIN that this one would make the reader into the perfect sweet and cute lover, better than all the rest she's seen. She would have the best for herself, and herself alone.<br />
<br />
She smiled at Mr.Clarkson and kissed him on the cheek. He was so cute and dreamy, she knew he would be a great too. He had already proven himself to be so romantic,  and soon she would have another boyfriend....</p>
