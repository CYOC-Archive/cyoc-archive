<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex could barely wrap his head around the changes he experienced since arriving on this world. Meeting the werewolves Raf and Roc, and receiving Roc’s blessing. Then on the farm with Bo, he learned about his new male reproductive system when his hole got wet ,then packing on muscle and another couple of inches to his already impressive new tool thanks to Roc’s blessing.<br />
<br />
The night with Marsyas had taught him he was definitely a bottom in this world. The pleasure he got from having another male inside him was indescribable. Did he really want to go back? Was it so bad here? Maybe after this errand he could find Bo and they could start a life together. Or maybe he would apprentice under Pascal while he carved out a place for himself in this world.<br />
<br />
“Hey, pup” Pascal barked. “While I appreciate the attention, if you don’t hurry up and fuck me I’m going to lose it!” He said with a laugh. Alex, lost in his thoughts, had continued his ministrations on Pascal’s furry nuts and his hole. A quick glance confirmed that Pascal’s cock was rock hard, completely unsheathed. Pascal’s hole was sopping wet, though Alex could smell that the moisture wasn’t his saliva alone. Alex may have been a bottom, but right now the furry Mastiff with tail raised was in need, and Alex was happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
“Sorry sir” Alex said with a smirk, and mounted Pascal, wrapping his forelegs around his mentor. He walked his hind legs forward, one paw in front of the other. Pascal’s scent had Alex completely unsheathed as well, and he murred as the tip of his penis brushed against Pascal’s soft furry haunches. Pascal shifted his weight so that Alex could hit his target, and both canines whined softly as the tip slid in. Alex continued walking forward, sliding inch after inch of himself into the horny wizard. Alex gave pause when his knot touched at the canine wizard’s entrance, reveling in the feelings of their fucking.<br />
<br />
“Ohh, good boy.” Pascal encouraged. “I still need to relax a bit before you get your knot in me” Alex drew his hips back, slowly sliding out of Pascal, the thrust forward, hit knot abutting against the wizard’s hole. “Fuck pup, just like that.” Pascal cooed.<br />
<br />
“Oh sir, you feel so good, I don’t know if I’ll last until I knot you” Alex panted.<br />
<br />
Pascal closed his eyes and concentrated. “Oh yes you will, just made sure of it. Now come on, fuck me pup.”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir” Alex said, increasing the speed of his humping.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, yeah, yeah! Good boy! Oh fuck!” Pascal panted. With each thrust his hole gave just a little more purchase. Alex was in a blind fog of lust, the praise from his mentor and the incredible pleasure from being inside him distracted Alex just enough for a bit of the canine to take over. In an act of pure instinct, Alex’s jaws clamped on the scruff of Pascal’s neck, causing Pascal’s entire body to relax in submission.  He pulled out once more, and with a forceful thrust, popped his knot into Pascal.<br />
<br />
“OH FUCK PUP” Pascal roared.<br />
<br />
“Oh... Oh God... Pascal... You’re so... Oh God...” Alex panted, jackhammer thrusting into the Wizard. Pascal’s hole wrapped around his knot driving him mad with lust.<br />
<br />
“Yeah pup, right there. Oh, oh good boy. Keep doing that. Oh yeah, Oh fuck, Ohhhhhhaaaaawooooooooo!” Pascal’s moan turning to a howl as a he sprayed canine seed on the floorboards of his room. <br />
<br />
The clenching of Pascal’s hole around Alex’s knot as he came was what it took. The orgasm hit Alex in a flash of white light as he completely emptied himself into Pascal. He was so engrossed in the release, he didn’t realize he was howling until he stopped, collapsing his weight onto the furry wizard.<br />
<br />
“Damn pup. That was better than I remembered. Are you sure you’re just a bottom?” Pascal cooed.<br />
<br />
“Ha... Ah... I think... whew. I think it had something... Ah! Oh wow, every time you squeeze me it feels Ah!  like I squirt a little more” Alex panted.<br />
<br />
“You do pup, I’m still squirting too” Pascal said with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Oh, I think it had something to do with whatever magic you put on me” Alex said.<br />
<br />
“I just made it so you wouldn’t finish before you got your knot in me pup, Oh! Yeah, thrust in me again. Ahh...” Pascal trailed off. “The fucking and biting my scruff was all you.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah well, I think that was more canine than me. The bottom in me would really like to see what your knot feels like sir” Alex said.<br />
<br />
“Trust me, that can be arranged. When you get back” Pascal said and gave a little squeeze. Just then, both canines heard clomping footfalls coming up the stairs.<br />
<br />
“What in THE WORLD is with all the barking and howling up here” Marsyas hollered from the stairwell.<br />
<br />
“Uh-oh. We woke the faun.” Pascal sighed. Marsyas stifled a laugh as he rounded into Pascal’s room to find the canines tied together.<br />
<br />
“It looks, and smells, like you two had quite a night!” Marsyas said with a laugh. The canine on top responded with a few yips and barks, only to be cut off by the larger canine he was tied to.<br />
<br />
“Remember pup, he can’t understand you. Not until you’re on two legs again.” Pascal explained.<br />
<br />
Marsyas approached the dogs, kneeling down to scratch behind their ears. “Good morning boys. I would have appreciated an invite, but I won’t hold it against ya. Why don’t I go get breakfast started while you two cuddle?” Marsyas stood, gave the couple a wink, and exited the room.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh Gods, I’m... uhn... I’m never going to get out of you if you don’t stop squeezing me sir” Alex moaned.<br />
<br />
“Just be quiet and enjoy it pup” Pascal said.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, both men joined Marsyas downstairs at the table. Alex sat next to Marsyas, and Pascal took the seat across the table from them. “Okay Alex” Pascal said.  “You’re going to need some more shapes for this errand I’m sending you two on. First we’ll go to the stables and get a stallion for you, that will make your journey faster. I’ll pack a saddlebag with food for the two of you and a set of clothing for you when you’re human Alex. We should find you something small too in case you need to hide, but there should be plenty of rats and mice along the way.” <br />
<br />
“Can we get him a goat, too?” Marsyas said with a smirk. Both men rolled their eyes and laughed.<br />
<br />
“Some sort of bird would be useful too.” Pascal continued. “There are usually quite a few ravens closer to the woods. If you were going alone Alex, I would suggest you just fly there. But you need Marsyas to guide you. I could turn him into a bird as well, but then he wouldn’t be able to change back until you return” Marsyas looked uneasy hearing this suggestion, but remained quiet. Pascal continued, “So you go by foot, or hoof more likely. Marsyas, I will loan you a communication talisman so the two of you can communicate no matter what species Alex is. It shouldn’t be more than a day and a half of walking to get to the tomb. Retrieving Endler’s lens shouldn’t take long once you’re inside. I would wager you’ll be back here before the end of the third day. Now, you will be spending two nights outside, so it might be a good idea to get you something with claws. After you have your bird, we’ll fly up toward the mountain and find Brune.”<br />
<br />
“Brune?” Alex asked.<br />
<br />
“Brune. Big mean Grizzly that calls the mountain his home.” Pascal said.<br />
<br />
“But he’s named. Is he a werebear?” Marsyas asked.<br />
<br />
“No. He’s a true Grizzly through and through. I named him. You see, Brune is a pretty solitary specimen, except during mating season. He gets pretty lonely, and the Grizzly population has been declining, so for the past 5 seasons I fly up to the mountain, change myself into a Grizzly and give Brune some cubs.”<br />
<br />
Alex’s mouth hung open in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“So he’s your mate?” Marsyas asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes and no” Pascal replied. “For a few days a season, yes, Brune is my cuddly bear. We spend the days foraging, frolicking, and I mate him over and over, then at night we sleep together in his den. Once the season’s heat leaves him and he is sure my cubs are growing in him, he becomes quite solitary again and I leave him be, returning to my home and my life here in Dicktin.” Pascal said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“That’s sweet” Alex said. “But as nice as claws and fangs would be, if I need firepower couldn’t I just turn into you and use your magic?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm...” Pascal pondered. “That is possible, though I would need to teach you the spells and we don’t have much time. Perhaps after we find Brune I can teach you a few rudimentary spells that could be helpful.”<br />
<br />
Alex smirked. “You sure are insistent on me getting the shape of the bear you mate with.”<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, quite astute pup.” Pascal said. “I may have an ulterior motive, but it won’t be anything you won’t enjoy” and gave Alex a wink.<br />
<br />
Marsyas rolled his eyes. “I don’t mean to interrupt you two lovebears, but isn’t it about time we get to work?” he stood, clearing his plate from the table.  The males dressed, and headed out into Dicktin. Not too far from Pascal’s residence Marsyas found a small white mouse for Alex. After acquiring the mouse and letting it go, they walked to the stables where Alex acquired a medium sized Arabian that Marsyas felt confident he could ride. From the stables, they walked to the edge of the town and Pascal called to a large raven with feathers the color of ink. The bird obliged and flew down to land on Pascal’s outstretched arm. The raven watched Alex with keen intelligence as he outstretched his arm for the bird to climb on. The bird seemed to question Pascal, and Pascal gave a slight nod. The raven gingerly stepped onto Alex’s arm, Alex focusing on the handsome bird and imprinting his shape. The bird once again regarded Pascal, who have another slight nod, and the bird took flight.<br />
<br />
“Friend of yours?” Marsyas asked.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes. I see him around town, he’s quite articulate and has some fascinating stories. Wizards and corvids are drawn to each other you know. Sometimes I go flying with him, but that’s about it.” Pascal explained. “Well, I think that’s it for around town. We should go find Brune. Have you ever flown before Marsyas?”<br />
<br />
“I have not and today won’t be that day.” Marsyas asserted, hoping they wouldn’t discover his fear of heights. “I am perfectly fine on the ground.”<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself. Would you mind doing the shopping for your trip while we’re gone then? We’ll send our clothes back with you too. You can study my notes after shopping to prepare you for tomorrow” Pascal said. Though he was hoping for a day of rest and maybe some fun in the Beastman district, Marsyas agreed to the change of plans for his day, especially if it meant he would be staying on the ground.<br />
<br />
They walked to the treeline so that they could disrobe and change. While public nudity wasn’t a crime, it was somewhat frowned upon. Pascal undid his robe and handed it to Marsyas, while Alex removed his tunic and the kilt the faun had given him. <br />
<br />
“Now remember pup. You have to go a bit further than just taking the physical shape. You’ll need some raven instincts so you can fly the first time.” Pascal offered. Alex nodded, closing his eyes and focusing on the large black bird. Truth be told, he was quite giddy about the prospect of flying. Back on Earth he had often wondered what it would feel like. He felt the vertigo of shrinking he has experienced when shifting to the dog. His nose and lips hardened, pushing out from his face into a beak. Bones hollowed and his skin tingled as feathers grew. His anus shifted, drawing his penis and testicles into a cloaca located just under his sprouting tail feathers. His feet shifted into talons, arms into wings, and Alex knew he was physically a raven. He kept concentrating, gaining instincts and memories, but making sure to stop before he went too far. Finished in his shift, Alex opened his eyes and let out a throat “Kraaa!” Looking up at his companions.<br />
 <br />
Pascal smirked, and turned to Marsyas. “We shouldn’t be more than a couple of hours. We will meet you back at my home.” With that, he uttered a few unintelligible words and blinked into a golden eagle roughly twice the size of Alex. With a nod Alex understood to mean “follow me”, and he took flight. Alex let the raven instincts take over. He crouched, sprung off the ground while spreading his wings and followed the wizard toward the mountain.<br />
<br />
“So is that a no on the goat then?” Marsyas called after them.</p>
