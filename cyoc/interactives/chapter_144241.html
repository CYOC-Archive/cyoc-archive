<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now class, I want volunteers for what is potentially the most important lesson of the day, maybe the most important lesson of your young adult lives.  You will all experience adulthood and you will all inevitably go through the profound changes we have discussed today.  However,  it is important to remember that procreation requires two people.  Two people from different sexes, who experience reality in distinctly different ways.  I am not going to spoil the journey through puberty you are going to experience any more than I already have today.  I will, however, offer anyone who wants it, the opportunity to experience the throws of passion felt by the opposite sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
The class erupted in poorly disguised whispers.  Everyone was curious to see who, if anyone would be changed, but no one was confident enough to volunteer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I implore you.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  This is something you may literally have no opportunity to experience for the rest of your lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the back of the classroom, one of the meekest girls in the class raised her hand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, Leana.  I didn&#39;t expect you to volunteer, but I am incredibly proud that you have.  So class, I&#39;m not going to beat around the bush here.  Who want&#39;s to have sex with Leana?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leana knew what she volunteered for but hearing it spoken aloud made her embarrassed and uncomfortable.  Peter, one of her childhood friends, was amazed to see her volunteer.  She never expressed any sexual desires before.  Peter didn&#39;t want to volunteer but he could see the look of pain and embarrassment on her face and couldn&#39;t help but jump to her rescue.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Peter.  I&#39;m not as surprised to see you raise your hand, but still, I&#39;m quite proud of you.  Will you both please join me at the front of the class.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two teens awkwardly waddled their way past their piers and stood next to each other at the front of the classroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, puberty and sexuality are important, slow burning experiences that develop as you develop as people.  Clearly, you two can&#39;t slowly develop into members of the opposite sex in front of this classroom, so I am going to drastically shortcut the experience.  When you both agree you are ready, I will send you both into the throws of opposite sex attraction.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The two teens waited for a moment then nodded in approval.  Before either of them realized what had happened, a quick, frightening bolt of electricity shot across their bodies.  The transformation to the opposite sex occurred so quickly, their classmates heard a faint popping sound as their physical forms spontaneously expanded. <br />
<br />
There was no time to think.  In front him him, Peter saw a tall, handsome man with a kind face and truly loving eyes.  There was no question in his mind.  He wanted to spend his life in this man&#39;s embrace, he was willing to give up his body for the chance to see a younger version of this man enter the world.  He could imagine the salty smell of his body and the feeling his his damp breath against Peter&#39;s head as they drifted off to sleep in a warm bed.  He imagined waking up early and putting on a cup of coffee, excited to be the first thing that man saw when he opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
In front of Leana was the most beautiful woman she had ever seen.  She had a petite build with an almost perfect bust that showed through a thin, low cut tank top.  She had auburn hair and freckles.   The sight of Leana&#39;s male form made her blush and recoil backwards in embarrassment.  Even though Leana had never seen Peter as a women before, her mind was filled with fond thoughts of their childhood.  She imagined the two of them playing with a pair of beautiful kids, just as they had played together in the past.  Although she thought it somewhat vulgar, Leana was absolutely consumed with the thought of physically placing herself inside of Peter.  The woman before her was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen and she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to kill a person to protect her.  <br />
<br />
Although the teens were each experiencing new, strong feelings towards each other, their bodies were reacted faster than their minds.  Leana threw her new, masculine arms around Peter and pulled Peter&#39;s feminine body as close to Leana&#39;s chest as she could manage.  In turn, Peter wrapped his feminine arms around Leana and placed his lips against her bare neck.  He angled his pelvis to let him rub his new, throbbing vagina against the material of Leana&#39;s pants.  As he started to grind against her, he felt her penis expand tightly against in inside of her pants.  <br />
<br />
Leana leaned in and started to kiss Peter again and again, each time pressing her lips more firmly against his.  Her arm, which was wrapped around the small of Peter&#39;s back, quickly made its way underneath his shirt.  As if she had done it a hundred times, she swiftly unhooked Peter&#39;s bra then ran her hand around to grope his partially exposed breast.  <br />
<br />
At the same time, Peter began to unbutton and unzip Leana&#39;s pants.  As soon as he could, he ran his hands down her pelvis and began to stroke her erect penis.  The thought of having it inside him drove him mad with pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaand, stop.&quot;  The teacher snapped his fingers and the two horny teens fell to the floor, now back in their original bodies.  &quot;I hate being a cock-tease, but I do have to enforce some level of decorum.  While I know it may be helpful for the class to hear you explain your experiences as the opposite sex,  I recognize that this experience is both highly instinctual and highly individual to each person.  So please, does anyone else want to volunteer?&quot;</p>
