<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fred? Is that you?&quot; Holly and Jeff both asked the question at the same time, with the result of a strange harmony in their voices.<br />
			<br />
			Fred, or rather what appeared to be Fred, sauntered up to the two-headed creature. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Hi Holly, Jeff,&quot; Fred said in his usual voice. <br />
			<br />
			It seemed strange coming from his body. <br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 29<br />

			<br />
			Fred was attired as a satyr, a half-goat, half man creature of mythology. <br />
			<br />
			Horns sprouted from his head, and a beard and goatee adorned his face. He was bare-chested, more muscular and with more chest hair than was normal for Fred. From the waist down, he appeared to be goat, with furry legs ending in hoofed feet. At his waist he carried a pan pipe, the traditional musical instrument of a satyr.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Is this why you refused to show yourself last night? Have you been like this since last night? What the hell are you anyway? Some kind of goat boy?&quot; Jeff mocked and interrogated.<br />
			<br />
			Fred frowned. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I was going to compliment you on your &#39;costume&#39;,&quot; he said, &quot;but if you&#39;re going to be rude...&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Ignore him,&quot; Holly laughed. &quot;He woke up on the wrong side of the bed.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She raised a glass of wine and took a sip.<br />
			<br />
			Fred chuckled. &quot;I can see that _one_ of you would always be getting up that way.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff reached up and wiped his brow. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Is it hot in here?&quot; he asked with a puzzled frown. <br />
			<br />
			Holly, too, wiped her forehead, then took another sip of her wine.<br />
			<br />
			Fred grinned. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Probably just me,&quot; he said. &quot;After all, I&#39;m a satyr, and I kind of have that effect on women.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;But...&quot; Jeff started to protest. Then he realized that he was starting to feel a bit aroused - their manhood was getting firm, <br />
			while he could visibly see their nipples standing fully erect. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I&#39;m not a woman,&quot; he argued.<br />
			<br />
			Holly frowned again. &quot;You mean to tell me that just being around you makes women horny? What did you do? Add some kind of pheromones when you changed?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff caught on a bit more slowly. &quot;You used the box to change into that?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He picked up his beer from the table beside them.<br />
			<br />
			Fred smiled. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;All I did was think of a satyr and the effects they were supposed to have on women. And it works,&quot; he added with <br />
			a grin. &quot;Something about my body chemistry makes women uncontrollably horny. I&#39;ve gotten laid three times already tonight!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He made a show of staring at their breasts. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;And I have to say, those tits of yours are making me feel kind of horny right now!&quot;<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			Jeff scowled, then he wound up to slap Fred. Holly, however, blocked that impulse, and their arm just swatted the air by Fred&#39;s head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Are you queer or something?&quot; he demanded. &quot;It&#39;s still me in here!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred leered. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You never had tits like that before,&quot; he observed.<br />
			<br />
			Holly laughed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Serves you right,&quot; she said to Jeff. She turned back to Fred. &quot;The large ... breasts ... were his idea, not mine!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff scowled at Holly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You try anything, goat boy, and I&#39;ll knock your head through the wall!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred laughed anew. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Oh, are you implying that you&#39;ve got _all_ the equipment that I _could_ try something?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s face flushed red, and he turned away from Fred&#39;s leering gaze. Holly, however, met his gaze levelly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You keep this up,&quot; she said calmly, &quot;and _I&#39;ll_ be the one tossing you through a wall.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fred realized he&#39;d pushed way past the point of humor. He decided that it was time to be discrete. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he tried to sound like a calm voice of reason. &quot;I get the message.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He shook his head.<br />
			 <br />
			“Speaking of added baggage, did you remember to bring the box?”<br />
			<br />
			Panicked expressions crawled up their faces before clumsily fumbling around their pockets. After a tense moment, they found the cube tucked securely in their skirt pocket. There was confusion of who would grab it until it was settled that Jeff would grab it.<br />
			<br />
			They less then gracefully held out the cube to Fred.<br />
			<br />
			”Sheesh! Must be that time of month for the two of you!&quot; He thanked sarcastically.<br />
			<br />
			Before they could react, he snatched the cube and scampered away, his hooves making a strange clicking sound on the floor.<br />
			<br />
			Feeling no real offense towards his friend, Jeff guzzled the remaining two inches of beer in his glass, then as a waiter passed by, he deposited the empty and grabbed a fresh one.<br />
			<br />

			added by ElrodW on 09/18/2016 06:38<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You&#39;re drinking too much,&quot; Holly observed as he took a sip.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; Jeff countered as he lowered the glass from his mouth.<br />
			<br />
			Holly frowned. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yes, you are. Remember, I&#39;m in this body too? And I can feel a buzz.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff raised his arm to take another drink, but Holly fought the arm, with the result of beer sloshing from the glass onto their blouse. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Look what you made me do!&quot; Jeff hissed. <br />
			<br />
			The hand without the beer glass reached up and patted uselessly at the wet fabric of the blouse.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;All I asked is for you to slow down the drinking,&quot; Holly insisted. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault you&#39;re so drunk you spilled your beer.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Great costume, Holly, Jeff!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			The two turned to see the source. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Uh,&quot; Holly stammered as she gazed at the pair approaching them, &quot;I&#39;m not sure...&quot;<br />
			<br />
			The woman laughed in a familiar voice. Every inch of her body, including her low-cut gown, was familiar. She took a sip from her wine glass. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You don&#39;t know who we are, do you?&quot;<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			Jeff frowned, then he shook his head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You&#39;re Raquel,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Or at least that&#39;s who you&#39;re supposed to be.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He glanced at the man accompanying Raquel. &quot;And Clint?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			The two nodded, smiles on their faces.<br />
			<br />
			Holly shook her head. &quot;But you&#39;re younger - like from the early seventies?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Clint grinned. &quot;But you still don&#39;t know who we really are, do you?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff shook his head. &quot;I give up. Your makeup and costumes are ... too good.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Raquel laughed, a pleasant friendly sound. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;We can thank Fred for that.&quot; She glanced up at her partner. &quot;Right, Amy?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s and Jeff&#39;s jaws dropped. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Amy?&quot; they both asked, staring at Clint. They turned to Raquel. &quot;Rich?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			The two stars smiled. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;We decided to ... swap ... for the evening. To make it harder for people to guess.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So,&quot; Holly said slowly, &quot;how ... far ... ?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Clint smiled knowingly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Do the changes go?&quot; she finished Holly&#39;s unspoken thoughts. &quot;All the way.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Clint leaned closer to Holly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;To be honest, I&#39;m going to try to get her drunk so I can seduce her later!&quot; he said with a wicked grin and a laugh.<br />
			<br />
			Raquel grinned. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I heard that,&quot; she giggled. Then she turned to Holly and Jeff. &quot;You know, I&#39;m having a lot of fun. You know - all <br />
			the attention because I&#39;m a sexy broad.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Then she frowned as she glanced at Jeff and Holly&#39;s breasts. &quot;But somehow, now I feel kind of ... inadequate!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She arched her back to make her breasts jut forward. Even then, they paled in comparison to the large bosom of Jeff and Holly.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So what, exactly, are you?&quot; Clint asked in a perplexed voice. &quot;Some kind of Star Journey transporter accident?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff grinned. &quot;There was an old B sci-fi movie where a scientist merged two bodies. I thought the two heads would be a nice added touch.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So how far did you go with the merger?&quot; Raquel asked with a wink.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped momentarily, then he frowned. &quot;That&#39;s kind of personal.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly just laughed. &quot;This is going to sound really weird and kinky, but we&#39;ve got both.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Raquel&#39;s eyes widened, as did Clint&#39;s. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You&#39;re a lot more creative than we were,&quot; Raquel said in an awed voice. <br />
			<br />
			Clint peered up and down their body. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Can I see?&quot; he finally blurted plainly.<br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 33<br />

			<br />
			&quot;What?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Can I see?&quot; he repeated. <br />
			<br />
			Clint glanced at Holly and shrugged. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I mean, we went to school together,&quot; he said to Holly. &quot;We did PE together. Remember, it&#39;s Amy in here.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Raquel took another sip of wine, then she grabbed Clint&#39;s hand. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Listen, you lecherous bastard,&quot; she said in a sweet yet firm tone, &quot;if you&#39;re going to start gawking at anybody&#39;s body around here, it better be mine!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She took Clint&#39;s arm and the two melted into the crowd.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;I&#39;m not feeling so good,&quot; Holly said after a moment&#39;s quiet. &quot;My stomach feels a bit upset.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff rolled his eyes. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re mixing wine and beer,&quot; he answered sarcastically.<br />
			<br />
			Holly turned and glared at him. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Who&#39;s mixing? Seems to me I was the first one to get a drink. And it wouldn&#39;t be so bad if you weren&#39;t pouring the beer down.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff ignored her comment. He gazed over the crowd. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I&#39;d like to dance.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He started walking toward a girl standing alone.<br />
			<br />
			Holly frowned. The walk turned to a drunken stagger as she fought Jeff for control. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You only dance with me,&quot; she protested. &quot;Or that&#39;s what you said!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff stopped. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;And I&#39;ll still be dancing with you,&quot; he said, trying to sound reassuring. &quot;But right now, we kind of need a partner.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So why does it have to be a girl?&quot; Holly asked, her words slurred ever so slightly. &quot;Why can&#39;t it be a guy?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;I&#39;m not dancing with a guy!&quot; Jeff protested. <br />
			<br />
			He turned back, and saw that the girl was gone. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Now she&#39;s gone,&quot; he complained.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Serves you right,&quot; Holly said sternly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay. Can we please ask someone to dance?&quot; Jeff changed tactics quickly.<br />
			<br />

			added by ElrodW on 09/18/2016 07:11<br />
			<br />
			Holly seemed taken aback, then she nodded slightly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay. That&#39;s better.&quot; She glanced around the room. &quot;Yes, we can dance.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Excuse me,&quot; a sultry voice said from beside Jeff, causing he and Holly to turn quickly. With the alcohol in their system, they swayed and staggered just a bit. They found themselves staring at a lithe dark-haired girl with Goth makeup wearing a sexy low-cut long black dress. She looked like a vampire, complete to the red stains around her lips. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Would you like to dance with me?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s eyes bulged out at the valley of cleavage the girl was showing, and he nodded enthusiastically. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said. He offered an arm to the girl.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Holly protested. &quot;Don&#39;t I get some say in who we dance with?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff stared at her for a moment; it was clear he hadn&#39;t considered _that_ angle. After all, he had asked if they could dance with someone, and she&#39;d agreed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Oh? I suppose you want to dance with some guy?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly glared at him. &quot;You could at least ask.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff glanced defiantly at her. &quot;I _did_ ask. And you said okay.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He turned back to watch the backside of the vampire girl, who was holding their hand and leading them to the dance floor. She had a shapely figure, and Jeff was finding himself getting turned on just following the wiggle of her rear.<br />
			<br />
			Just as they reached the dance floor, the song ended. The vampire smiled, indicating that they should wait for the next song. As soon as it started, the vampire girl started swaying to the music, dancing rhythmically and seductively beside Jeff and Holly. Jeff tried to dance as well, but he could tell Holly was not cooperating. The result was some kind of monstrous drunken stumble around the dance floor. Given that it was Halloween, and given their &#39;costume&#39;, it somehow seemed fitting.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;She&#39;s a little tramp!&quot; Holly hissed in Jeff&#39;s ear. <br />
			<br />
			He ignored her, watching the girl dancing instead. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Oh, great!&quot; Holly sighed bitterly. &quot;Now you&#39;re getting horny watching her dance!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff turned briefly to Holly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;No I&#39;m not,&quot; he protested.<br />
			<br />
			Holly rolled her eyes. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Then what are we doing with a hard-on?&quot; she asked sarcastically. &quot;And why are our nipples firm? Or are you going to say something lame like it&#39;s cold in here?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff glanced at Holly, shooting her a look of disapproval. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You said we could dance. So why don&#39;t you just enjoy yourself?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He turned back to the vampire girl.<br />
			<br />

			added by ElrodW on 09/18/2016 07:25<br />
			<br />
			Holly turned away from the girl, a pout frozen on her face. She scanned the crowd, looking at the costumes, scanning for faces she recognized, and generally doing anything and everything to avoid having fun dancing. <br />
			<br />
			The music changed again, and Holly was caught by surprise by a whiff of perfume wafting about her face. She turned and saw the vampire girl held close in their arms - or rather, as close as their bosom would allow. The girl&#39;s eyes were half-closed, and she was swaying very seductively, rubbing her own breasts and body against theirs in a very intense manner.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Holly hissed at Jeff. She could feel the girl rubbing against the bulge in their pants, and it was alarming her.<br />
			<br />
			The girl looked up at both faces. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You know, I&#39;m really glad I met you tonight,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I can tell I excite you.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s mouth dropped open. Jeff&#39;s eyes widened, but he said nothing.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;In fact,&quot; the girl admitted, &quot;you excite me.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;I don&#39;t follow,&quot; Jeff said cautiously. He wasn&#39;t quite sure, given their semi-drunken state, what this girl was implying.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;I want you. Both of you,&quot; the girl said plainly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You see,&quot; she blushed a bit, &quot;I&#39;m bi, and you two are so ... exciting to me.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She rubbed insistently against their crotch again. Holly felt the surge of energy from their aroused member. It was <br />
			startlingly powerful, strong enough to distract her.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You want to go to my room?&quot; the girl asked seductively as she rubbed her breasts against theirs.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff glanced at Holly, and he could see that she was conflicted. The sexy perfume, the erotic rubbing disguised as dancing, the unfamiliar and strong sensations from their crotch - all of these were confusing Holly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Let&#39;s go with her,&quot; Jeff whispered insistently to Holly. <br />
			<br />
			He, too, felt the powerful arousal, and he wanted - no, needed - to get some relief from his nearly overwhelming desire.<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s mouth dropped open again. &quot;But ... she&#39;s a girl.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So am I.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;So, I&#39;m not a lesbian!&quot; Holly hissed.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;But she wants _us_. And we&#39;re part guy.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;We _can&#39;t_! It isn&#39;t right!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Why not? We&#39;re horny. She&#39;s horny. She&#39;s willing. What else do we need?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly stared, open mouthed, at Jeff for a moment. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Just like a guy!&quot; she snapped. &quot;Thinking with your little head instead of your big one!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;And you know you&#39;re curious. Aren&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			MAU: The Ultimate Costume, part 36<br />
			added by ElrodW on 09/18/2016 07:38<br />
			<br />
			Jeff continued to plead his case. Alcohol had dulled his sensibilities, and he was being ruled by his passions. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You should try it!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You&#39;re sick!&quot; Holly hissed. &quot;And I&#39;m _not_ curious!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She turned away angrily. Then she turned back for a moment. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;And anyway, it&#39;d be cheating on me. Kind of. Somehow.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Her last words were soft, stammered, uncertain, as if she were groping for some kind of sane argument.<br />
			<br />
			The vampire girl watched the argument as she swayed against them in time to the music. As it ended, she pulled herself up on her tiptoes. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I can see your other half isn&#39;t ready. Yet.&quot; She gave Jeff a kiss on his mouth. &quot;But remember, I&#39;m available if you change your minds.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She lowered herself and sauntered away, her hips swaying sexily. She turned and blew a kiss over her shoulder at them.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff stood, watching her walk away, one hand absently rubbing their crotch. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Stop that!&quot; Holly hissed at him.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff glanced angrily at Holly, then he reached up and pinched their tit. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Ow,&quot; he said softly, wincing at the same time Holly did. <br />
			<br />
			He&#39;d forgotten, in the heat of the moment, that he was attached to the breasts as much as she was.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Good riddance,&quot; Holly said, her words dripping with venom. <br />
			<br />
			She made them turn and walk slowly from the dance floor. As they passed a waiter, Jeff snagged another beer. They walked awkwardly to a table and slumped into a vacant chair. Jeff set his beer down on the table.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You were going to cheat on me, weren&#39;t you?&quot; Holly demanded.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;But ... it wouldn&#39;t have been ... it was _both_ of us!&quot; Jeff protested weakly. &quot;It wasn&#39;t like ....&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He stopped as he realized, slowly, how pathetic his excuse sounded. They sat in silence for a couple of minutes. Finally, Jeff turned to Holly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I guess I did want to screw her. I would have, I suppose,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I don&#39;t know why.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Because you were horny as hell,&quot; Holly answered.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff thought for a moment, pausing to sip his beer. &quot;But I&#39;ve never ... I mean, no girl ever got me so horny that I even thought of cheating on you!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s anger lessened. &quot;You&#39;re not used to having sensitive nipples that make you horny. And you&#39;re drunk.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;_We&#39;re_ drunk,&quot; Jeff corrected.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;We&#39;re drunk,&quot; Holly agreed.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;But still...&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly kissed him before he say anything else. <br />

			<br />
			Holly kissed him again before he could do anything else. Given the proximity of their heads, it was easy for her. Her lips parted, and they began to kiss more and more passionately. As they kissed, a hand slipped up and began to caress one of their breasts, causing the nipple to instantly harden. Their breathing started to get ragged, and after a moment, Holly slid the other hand down to rub on their crotch. <br />
			<br />
			Jeff broke the kiss for a moment, and he burst out laughing uncontrollably, despite his best effort not to. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What?&quot; Holly asked, annoyed that he was laughing in the midst of their rising passion.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;How are we supposed to &#39;make up&#39; with this body?&quot; he chortled.<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s eyes widened, then she started snickering too. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that. It&#39;s a good thing you stopped when you did. Before you got us too horny, that is!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff laughed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Unless you want to go find the vampire again,&quot; he suggested playfully.<br />
			<br />
			Holly grinned wickedly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You keep up that touching and kissing, and I just might go looking for her,&quot; she answered.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s mouth dropped open. <br />
			<br />
			Holly laughed softly. &quot;I&#39;m only joking. And anyway, you&#39;re getting turned on by our tits, so is it any wonder I&#39;m getting turned on by our ... thing?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Speaking of our ... thing,&quot; Jeff interrupted, &quot;we&#39;ve got to get to the bathroom before we have a problem.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly frowned. &quot;Yeah, I see what you mean.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Then she wrinkled her forehead. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Which one do we use?&quot; she asked.<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			Jeff thought for a second. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;The men&#39;s room,&quot; he answered as if it were obvious.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;With tits and legs like this?&quot; Holly asked incredulously. <br />
			<br />
			They started walking in the general direction of the restrooms.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff frowned. &quot;But we&#39;ve got a willy. We _have_ to use the men&#39;s room.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Why? Because ...&quot; Jeff thought for a moment, but no answer came to him. &quot;Well, just because.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;But we look like a woman, too,&quot; Holly protested.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;The men&#39;s room is right here. And we need to go bad.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly started to protest, but she, too, felt the pressure in their bladder. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Well,&quot; she said reluctantly as she let Jeff walk them into the men&#39;s room, &quot;I guess so.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Fortunately for Holly&#39;s sense of modesty, the rest room was empty. Jeff stepped to the urinal and, despite the handicap of <br />
			having two brains trying to control the one body, and the unfamiliar pantyhose and skirt, he quickly got their willy freed from their briefs. A profound sense of relief flooded them as their bladder gushed its contents into the urinal.<br />
			<br />
			As the last few drops fell, Jeff noticed something. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked.<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s eyes widened. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What?&quot; she shot back, her voice innocent.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;You were ... playing!&quot; Jeff accused. &quot;You were going to whack off!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly&#39;s mouth hung open for a second, then she shook her head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; she protested.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Don&#39;t give me that. You were going to whack off!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly felt her cheeks burn, and she started to protest, then she shut her mouth. As Jeff tucked things back in and pulled up the panty hose, she sighed. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Okay, so I was. So what? Can you blame me for being curious?&quot;<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			&quot;That was fun. But weird,&quot; Holly mumbled as they walked unsteadily off the dance floor. <br />
			<br />
			On her side of the body was Clint, while Raquel was on Jeff&#39;s side; the two were bracing Jeff and Holly to help them stay standing. The trio had danced - it was Holly&#39;s idea that they do a &#39;group dance&#39; since they were both man and woman. Clint and Raquel had gotten a big kick out of it, as had most of the other party-goers. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;An eminently practical solution,&quot; Jeff slurred with a grin. They sat down at their table and Jeff picked up his beer. &quot;I especially liked the slow dance.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Well, they&#39;re playing another one. Want to go again?&quot; Holly said, carefully forming each word. Her eyes were a bit glazed and her tongue felt numb, making it hard to speak coherently. She picked up her wine glass. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Too late,&quot; she observed. <br />
			<br />
			Clint and Raquel were already making their way back on the floor, and from the way they started grinding their bodies together, they appeared to be having sex while dancing.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;May I join you?&quot; The sultry voice was back.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff turned, and after taking a moment to steady himself and to focus, he saw ......<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			Jeff turned, and after taking a moment to steady himself and to focus, he saw the vampire girl again. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Sure,&quot; he said. <br />
			<br />
			The girl saw Jeff&#39;s eyes, then she looked at Holly. &quot;Are you guys okay?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff grinned stupidly. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Sure! We&#39;re just ...&quot; His voice cut off and he sat trying to focus. The effort of simultaneous conversation and staring were too much for him.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Never mind him,&quot; Holly stammered. &quot;He&#39;s drunk.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She giggled. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;s&#39;matter of fact, so&#39;m I.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She giggled some more. She leaned close to the vampire girl. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;We had a little bet,&quot; she whispered, as if conveying state secrets. &quot;We wanted to see who passed out first.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She giggled again. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Know somethin&#39;? I&#39;m gonna&#39; win!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She grinned. <br />
			<br />
			The vampire girl frowned. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not driving tonight.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff stirred for a moment. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;&#39;S okay,&quot; he muttered. &quot;We&#39;re staying here tonight.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He let his gaze drop to the girl&#39;s chest. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;We got a nice comfortable ... cleavage to sleep in!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			He grinned again, then fell silent.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Know somethin&#39;?&quot; Holly whispered to the vampire girl. &quot;We&#39;ve got a willy in our pants!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She giggled. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I bet you thought we were just a girl!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She leaned toward the girl&#39;s ear again. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Know somethin&#39; else? Jeff wanted to screw you earlier. He wanted me to, too!&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Holly straightened her head and stared at the girl. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What&#39;s your name, anyway?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Carol,&quot; she answered. The girl shook her head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Let me help you to your room,&quot; she offered, standing and helping Holly lever their body upright. &quot;You&#39;re pretty drunk.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Carol?&quot; Holly mouthed. &quot;Why isn&#39;t it something like Draculina?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			With Carol&#39;s help, they staggered slowly from the party.<br />

			<br />
			A fierce pounding greeted Jeff&#39;s mind the moment consciousness started to return. He winced, then he pried an eye open. The sunlight streaming in the open curtain nearly blinded him, and he clamped his eyes shut again.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;What a dream,&quot; Jeff muttered to himself as he began to collect his thoughts. <br />
			<br />
			Slowly, however, strange sensations intruded on his mental awakening. He heard breathing close to him, and he risked opening his eyes again. He saw a platinum blond mass of hair beside him on the pillow. At the same time, he felt something heavy on his chest. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Oh, shit!&quot; he muttered as he lifted a hand toward the blanket covering himself. <br />
			<br />
			Wincing, Jeff pulled the blanket back, and he flinched when he saw the soft rounded mounds rising and falling on his chest with each breath. He let the blanket fall.<br />
			<br />
			Slowly, to avoid the jackhammers pounding his brain, Jeff turned his head again. The mass of blond hair, he knew with certainty, was on Holly&#39;s head. Which, thanks to Fred&#39;s weird machine, was on a joint body. Which had tits. Jeff looked at Holly again. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;It wasn&#39;t a dream,&quot; he muttered softly.<br />
			<br />
			The soft sigh on the other side startled Jeff. The quick turn of his head was rewarded by a ferocious burst of pain, and he closed his eyes and locked his muscles to prevent further motion. Slowly, the pain subsided. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;How much did we drink?&quot; Jeff thought aloud. His eyes pried open again.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff&#39;s heart leaped to his throat at the sight that greeted him. <br />
			<br />
			There was a girl next to him in bed. A dark-haired girl with vampire makeup. And she was naked. Jeff felt panic swell within him. <br />
			<br />
			What the hell had happened? <br />
			<br />
			And how was he ever going to explain this to Holly?<br />
			<br />
			He felt stirring beside him, and he turned back just as Holly&#39;s eyes opened. They looked as bloodshot and battle-worn as his felt. Slowly, she adjusted to her surroundings, although she seemed less hung over than he was. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Morning,&quot; she muttered as she lifted her head to kiss him.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Morning,&quot; Jeff answered uneasily. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Great party,&quot; Holly tried to make small talk. &quot;But I think we drank too much.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			She felt the bed move, and she lifted her head. Her face was unreadable to Jeff as she saw the girl next to them.<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			&quot;Uh,&quot; Jeff sputtered quickly.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;I ... that is, I&#39;m not sure ... I don&#39;t know how she got here!&quot; he finally blurted out. <br />
			<br />
			Holly frowned. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she said evenly.<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Honest!&quot; he protested. &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything! I didn&#39;t do anything, either!&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly let him babble for a few moments, then she shook her head, cutting off his words. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;What _do_ you remember?&quot; she asked cautiously.<br />
			<br />
			Jeff frowned as he thought. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;You got mad at me for wanting to dance with her. I think. And we were dancing with... Raquel?&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Holly nodded slowly to avoid causing pain in her own head. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;Yeah, it was Raquel. You don&#39;t remember talking to her,&quot; she nodded toward the sleeping girl, &quot;after dancing with Raquel and Clint?&quot;<br />
			<br />
			&quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; Jeff finally demanded. &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Holly smiled thinly. &quot;You passed out. She helped us get back up here.&quot;<br />
			<br />
			Jeff nodded; a bit of the night was being revealed. But there were still mysteries. Such as ....<br />
			<br />
			&quot;Who is she? And why is she still here? And why is she naked?&quot; he asked, deciding to start with the obvious.<br />
			<br />
			Holly winced. <br />
			<br />
			&quot;I think we kind of, you know,&quot; she looked down, and her face was reddening, &quot;had... sex.&quot;</p>
