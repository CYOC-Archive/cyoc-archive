<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael was in dire need of a change. Micheal was an middle aged man around 5 feet and weighed a ton.<br />
<br />
Michael was going through a midlife-crises. in his mid fifties, he wasnt really proud with where he ended up. he never got a major growthspurt during puberty, he was divorced to his former highschool sweetheart, he raised a son all on his own, he gained alot of weight and gained some unhealthy habits, he had difficulty handling his finances, his son moved out of the house and never called again. Just recently he lost his job at the accounting firm. His life was in the truest sense of the word... &quot;A Mess&quot;.<br />
<br />
Michael would often stare out his cheap apartment window to stare jealously at his neighbor Joel, Joel was Young, Fit, Had his stuff together and was also openly gay as compared to Michael who was closeted and felt pressured and insecure in his own sexuality. Michael would give anything to be something better, or something else entirely.<br />
<br />
He was currently sitting on a small bench on a train station platform near his apartment to catch the cheapest train to go at a job interview, convenient when he had to go out of town, but terrible when he wanted to sleep but was woken up by train sounds at 4am. did i mention he has a terrible sleep schedule?<br />
<br />
Michael was nodding off, waiting for the train, it was getting pretty late but the moon light kept the platform well illuminated. though as he was about to fall completly asleep, the sound of thunder woke him up. He looked up to see it was raining heavily outside, to bad he didnt bring an umbrella, he could of checked the weather before leaving. as the platform becomes quiet again, the silence was cut short by the sound of Michael&#39;s phone ringing.<br />
<br />
He picked it up, not recognizing the number, he answered. On the other end of the call was a cold, emotionless static voice. &quot;Would you like to go Elsewhere?&quot; it said. Micheal denied the offer, but deep down he was curious as to what the voice was reffering to, Michael did want to start over and have a better chance at things. The call abruptly ended, confused, he quickly hung up and put his phone away and continued to wait.<br />
<br />
Though the wait was&#39;nt long as a train arrived at the station, though it was not the usual modern train or metro. Instead it was a rather old looking train, made of black metal and decorated with dark green paint and butterfly motifs. Several passengers cars attached to the engine can also be seen, Michael couldnt make out what was in them but he could distincly hear the laughs and cheers of passengers. on the side of the train engine was written the words &quot;Elsewhere Express&quot;. As Michael was admiring the train, his attention turned to the sounds of doors opening and saw the entrance to climb onboard, most curious though was that no one was exiting the train.<br />
<br />
Michael&#39;s sleep deprived hald told him this might be the train to get him to his job interview, his other more rational side told him not likely, but it couldnt hurt to look inside, a bit of adventure to spice things up.<br />
<br />
Michael walked foward, peering through the door, the cabin entrance was awfully dark. though in the darkness, he spot something gleaming in the low moonlight, as he steped foward to take a closer look. he steped into the cabin entrance. as his foot left the entrance, the light turned on and the doors closed behind him. he turned and tried to open the doors to no avail, he then saw the station moving. The train was leaving the station! he tried to escape but could not and soon the station platform was out of view and the outside would was hidden as the train entered a tunnel blocking the view.<br />
<br />
in the cabin, Michael was panicking but tried to calm himself. he turned his attention to the thing that got him into this mess. embedded into the wall was a golden plaque that reflected the light of the cabin. Under it was a table equiped with papers and pens. the plaque on the wall had a slit which seemed to be where you can insert some papers, and etched into the golden plate was tje following question. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is you Final destination&quot;<br />
<br />
Micheal annoiyed took a pen and wrote on a paper. &quot;somewhere better than here&quot;. as he inserted the paper into the slot. a door that was leading into the main section of the car unlocked. seeing as there was nowhere else to go, he opened the door walked into the room.</p>
