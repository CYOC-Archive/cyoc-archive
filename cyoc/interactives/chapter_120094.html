<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just then, the cranes then pick up Matt&#39;s motorcycle suit body, gloves, and boots, as he lets out muffled grunts or screams and in vain, tries to move to break free from the grip of the cranes as they go to another room, holding his helmet head shows him a mechanical skeleton that he is going to be put on. Matt wondering what it does, continues to let out muffled screams begging the cranes not to stuff that thing, but the cranes still continue their jobs as they open up Matt&#39;s suit and stuff the skeleton inside, then insert his booted feet, gloved hands, and finally his helmet head as the collars then snap and beep knowing the assembly is complete. The inside padding then fills up his hollow body comforting his new skeleton as it links the collars magnetically.<br />
<br />
Luke on the other hand, is vaguely aware of his surroundings. Can&#39;t see, can&#39;t move but twitch a bit, and a quiet moan somewhere inside him physically, wondering what has happened, as the floor beneath him shifts to the other room and can hear the muffled screams of horror from Matt. He wishes he can move to save him, but in his position, he can do nothing but just stay there and wait to see what happens next.<br />
<br />
The crane, holding Matt the living motorcycle suit in the air slowly puts him down as a screen panel comes down from the ceiling. To his right, he sees a motorcycle with some human features that Luke is now and hopes he is still alive in someway. The screen lights up displaying texts. &lt;Hello Matt, please try and move.&gt; Matt wondering how it knows his name, then tries to move and realizes he can bend his arms as the leather creaks. He notices that they&#39;re somewhat a bit heavier than his normal body is. He then moves his head down to see his bending arms and curls and uncurls his right gloved hand. He then looks straight again as the panel displays more texts. &lt;Good! Now, try to walk.&gt; Matt then looks down again and tries to lift his left boot and can feel the heavy difference as he groans in effort. With one heavy step, he manages to walk but wobbles in his new form. &lt;Easy now. It will take time for you to get used to it.&gt; the screen says as it pulls out railings for him just in case he needs it. To Matt, it feels like he is carrying lead in his feet as he moves his other foot. With each step, he manages to get the hang of his new weight as he makes it to the halfway point of the room. &lt;Very good!&gt; the screen text says and continues, &lt;You have a lot of questions that needs to be answered, and if the major question of you and your friend, Luke, to be able to turn back to normal, is, well, maybe. I haven&#39;t been able to make it since they shut down my systems to make the reverse process.&gt; That answer didn&#39;t satisfy Matt much and lets out a muffled grunt. Too Luke, he couldn&#39;t hear what Matt was grunting to. <br />
<br />
The screen displays more texts, &lt;However, since you and Luke came down from the school, it reactivated my systems to make the reversing stages for you and your friend. But will take time.&gt; In front of Matt, is a keyboard that is rising up from the floor and the screen display shifts in front of it for Matt to type on the keyboard to respond as another line of texts are displayed, &lt;If you need more questions, type on to this keyboard, I am afraid there is no way to fix your vocal bug due to long time shut down.&gt; Matt, still slowly struggling to walk to it, then types on the keyboard, which is also a bit difficult to type since his fingers are gloves and a bit more puffy, &lt;Who are you? What have you done to us?!&gt; the screen responds, &lt;I apologize for turning you and your friend into bio-mechanical creatures of speed, but that was my programming. My name is Halberd. I was created to make living bio motorcycle suits and motorcycle itself by human beings that want to be motorcycles in someway.&gt; Matt then types another question, &lt;Who created you before the school was built?&gt; the screen replies, &lt;It was a principal several years ago who decided to make this underground facility. However, he didn&#39;t have the full funding and needed to redirect his funding to educational things before he decides to bring me back online again. Since then, he pulled the plug on me- No, wait, he kept me in hibernation until someone comes. And you and Luke did.&gt; The screen displayed more texts, &lt;Anymore questions? Y/N?&gt;<br />
<br />
Matt wanted to know more, and hit Y, and typed another question, &lt;Halberd, what do you want us to do now that we are some sort of motorcycle freaks? Can we eat? Sleep? Or anything human related?&gt; Halberd replies, &lt;It is your choice, and again, I apologize for turning you and your friend into biomechanical motorcycle. It was in my programming to do so once you stepped into the conversion chamber. But for now, you and your friend can ride out on the road and tell anyone who wants to be like you or Luke to come by and be converted into bio mechanical rides. And do not worry, I will make sure to make the excuses for the school staff and your families about you and Luke being gone. And no, you do not need to worry about eating or drinking. However, you can still sleep. And cleaning is still optional, well to make you more shiny and new like you are now, Mr. Matt.&gt; He then stops answering questions, &lt;Well, I guess we can go out and drive off somewhere. Thanks for the information Halberd.&gt; Halberd replies, &lt;You are welcome. And for now, this will be your new room until the reversing process will be complete. If you need more information, I will be here. Have fun!&gt;<br />
<br />
Matt nods as a table rises showing Luke&#39;s keys on his right and grabs it. Already adapting to his new form, he then sits on Luke&#39;s seat as Luke can feel someone on his back and an ignition key then turns him on as Matt revved his engines and Luke lets out a muffled scream and his vision immediately comes back and tries to move on his own. With Luke&#39;s engine purring, in Matt&#39;s vision, there was a chat hud to Luke, &lt;Aaaahhhh!!! What happened to me?! Why do I feel a lot of rush inside me?! What&#39;s going on?!&gt; Matt realizes he can hear his thoughts through chat like speak. He then tries to talk to him that way, &lt;It&#39;s okay Luke, it&#39;s me.&gt;<br />
Luke- &lt;Matt?! What&#39;s going on?! Why am I a motorcycle?!&gt; <br />
Matt- &lt;The computer named, Halberd turned us into some sort of bio motorcycle thing. But we can be turned back, but not now.&gt;<br />
Luke- &lt;Not now!? I got studies to do!&gt;<br />
Matt- &lt;Halberd will take care of it while we&#39;re gone. Until then, we get to have fun driving!&gt;<br />
Luke- &lt;Why are you enjoying this?! Tell this Halberd to do it fast!&gt;<br />
Matt- &lt;Well, he was shut down for a long time, it wasn&#39;t his fault he couldn&#39;t control his programming. We&#39;ll be okay, just enjoy some r&r for now.&gt;<br />
Luke was worried, but he did need some time to rest up.<br />
Luke- &lt;*Mental sigh* Fine, but if something happens to us while we&#39;re gone before we get turned back, I will kick your ass!&gt;<br />
Matt- &lt;Fine by me! :) &gt;<br />
Matt then grabs his handlebars and revs Luke up as he lets out a forced muffled sound from his voice.<br />
Luke- &lt;Why do I moan or groan when you rev me? That&#39;s weird, but it is awesome at the same time!<br />
Matt- &lt;Don&#39;t ask me and enjoy it.&gt;<br />
The room then opens up a ramp at the ceiling as it comes down, Matt then places his booted foot on one pedal and aims Luke at the ramp as he then places the other on the other pedal and drive up the ramp and to the surface at midnight as they go for a ride around town as Matt lets out a muffled howl as they drive off far away from the school. Matt then pats Luke&#39;s side and talks to him through chat again,<br />
Matt- &lt;Where do you want to go?&gt;</p>
