<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After you leave the magic shop and get back into the car, you spend the rest of the day in a haze. You don&#39;t really know or care what&#39;s happening, you&#39;re just kind of there. Brooke tries to make conversation with you, but most of what she says just goes in one ear and out the other. She takes you out for breakfast, but you don&#39;t really say anything, playing with your food more than you&#39;re eating it. Once you get home, you flop face down onto your bed, not bothering to change out of your clothes, cover up in a blanket, or even take off Brooke&#39;s flip flops. Before you know it, you fall asleep.<br />
<br />
When you do finally wake up, you can immediately tell Brooke&#39;s been in the bedroom with you - your flip flops are gone, your hair is down out of the pony tail, and you&#39;re wrapped up in your favorite blanket. Not wanting to wake up just yet, you curl up tighter in the blanket. You breathe in and find yourself entranced by the smell of it. It smells like you - or at least, your old body. Brooke always had a thing for wearing clothes that smelled like you for some reason, and you begin to understand why. The scent of your old body is absolutely intoxicating now. You can feel your whole body becoming relieved and relaxed as you inhale the aroma of the bed sheets deeply, not wanting to let go. It feels like your body is there without really being there, and you clutch the blanket close to your chest. Just then, you hear the door knob turn and the door squeaks softly as Brooke cracks it open.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m awake,&quot; you say, your voice low and a little scratchy. Brooke walks in, shutting the door behind her. She sits on the edge of the bed and puts her hand on your hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling baby?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; you say. &quot;What time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;9:45-ish,&quot; Brooke says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we... Can we talk?&quot; You ask, sitting up. You try to push Brooke&#39;s long hair out of your face. A few of the hairs fall back down and tickle your nose, so you lean your head back and try to blow them back out of the way. Brooke smiles slightly as you bring your head back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m just really scared, you know?&quot; You gather up some of the blanket&#39;s excess and hug it in your lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Brooke nods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just about being pregnant, or being stuck in your body. That much I think I could handle... I just... I don&#39;t know, please don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but I&#39;m really scared, for us, our relationship,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? You don&#39;t think I&#39;d leave you, do you?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... No, I know you won&#39;t. This whole thing is just so fucked, I...&quot; Brooke leans in and kisses you before you can finish your thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it baby. You&#39;re overthinking everything. My body has that effect on people,&quot; she says with a smirk. You let out a small laugh and hug your blanket even tighter. &quot;You&#39;re stuck with me forever, you hear?&quot; She puts her hand on your shoulder. &quot;Forever and always.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forever and always,&quot; you say, forcing a smile. &quot;Ugh, this is going to be the longest 45 minutes of my life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OUR lives,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m scared too? I&#39;m sorry, but I prefer being in my own body.&quot; She pulls you close and gives you a tight hug. &quot;I told you before, we&#39;ll get through this. And, I&#39;m sorry, for last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have worn protection. I know you keep condoms in your nightstand, but everything happened so fast last night I didn&#39;t even think about it. Before I knew it you were on top of me, and I was so horny I wasn&#39;t thinking straight, I&#39;m sorry...&quot; her voice trailed off. It wasn&#39;t until just then you realized that Brooke is just as scared as you are, and she blames herself for all the stress of today.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault baby,&quot; you say, looking up into her eyes. &quot;Both of our new hormones flooded our minds, and I wasn&#39;t thinking clearly either. Please don&#39;t blame yourself, none of this would have happened if I didn&#39;t bring those stupid necklaces home from that stupid magic shop. We wouldn&#39;t even know about the magic shop if I hadn&#39;t taken the long way home from the restaurant. We both did things we shouldn&#39;t have yesterday,&quot; you said. Brooke looks down at the blanket you&#39;re holding, playing with it in her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get what you&#39;re saying, but that doesn&#39;t make me feel any less bad,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what, we&#39;ll split the blame. Equally my fault and your fault.&quot; Brooke rolls her eyes and gives you a playful push.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; she says, shaking her head with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m going to pass the time by taking a shower,&quot; you say, pushing the blanket aside. &quot;You&#39;re welcome to join me if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would, but you know what happens every time we take a shower together, and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to avoid right now,&quot; she says. &quot;Plus, I just took one a few hours ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good point,&quot; you say, standing up off the bed. You lean over and give Brooke a long, passionate kiss before heading into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;And brush your teeth while you&#39;re in there!&quot; Brooke yells just after you close the door. You crack open the door and give her the finger, sticking your tongue out. She returns the gesture, and you shut the door.<br />
<br />
You turn on the water, trying to get it hot before you get in. While the water runs, you strip Brooke&#39;s clothes off and toss them on the floor. Pulling her hair back, you inspect your body in the mirror. Her D-cup chest, plump ass, hourglass frame, all of this may be yours for much longer than you originally intended. You start to notice all the little flaws Brooke is always complaining about. The light bags under her eyes, the little bit of acne she usually covers with makeup, how her right breasts is just a little bigger than her left. You never cared about any of this stuff before you were in her body - you thought she was perfect just the way she was. But now, in her body, you can start to see where she&#39;s coming from.<br />
<br />
You stick your hand under the running water and it&#39;s finally hot enough, so you step inside. The shower seems bigger to you - you have more room on your sides, and the detachable shower head seems to be up much higher now than it was before, even though you know it&#39;s you that&#39;s changed and not your shower.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not exactly sure how to wash Brooke&#39;s hair, but you figure doing it wrong just this once won&#39;t hurt anything. You lather up with her shampoo, then rinse it out, then repeat the process with her conditioner.<br />
<br />
Before you grab her body wash, you stand under the hot running water and close your eyes. The water is relaxing, and helps to soothe some of Brooke&#39;s sore muscles. After a few minutes of thinking to yourself, you open your eyes. You lather her sponge with her body wash, and begin to scrub your body.<br />
<br />
Washing yourself this time feels like a different process than it normally does. Your skin is smooth, with little to no body hair. The sponge glides along your skin easier, your legs in particular. With a smaller body, you have less of yourself to wash, and are able to finish quicker than you normally do. Brooke keeps her toothbrush and toothpaste in the shower, so you brush her teeth while you rinse off the soap from your body.<br />
<br />
Turning the water off, you open the shower curtain to a steam filled bathroom. You instinctively grab your towel instead of Brooke&#39;s and start drying your hair, but there&#39;s so much of it you realize you&#39;re going to have to wrap your hair up in the towel to absorb most of the water. Having never done that, the end result looks more like a do-rag than anything. You grab one of Brooke&#39;s towels and dry off the rest of your body from top to bottom. You wrap the towel around your waist and open the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Brooke is still laying on your bed, watching a video on her phone. She looks up and smiles at you, then begins to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so funny?!&quot; You demand, putting a hand on your hip.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t know anything about being a girl, do you? Come here,&quot; she says, sitting up on the edge of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no, actually, it&#39;s kind of my first day with the new body,&quot; you say matter-of-factly as you walk over to her. Brooke chuckles and takes the towel off from your waist, re-tying it around your chest, over your boobs. Oops.<br />
<br />
Then she takes the towel off your head, scooping up all your hair in one swift motion and creating a neat and tight little towel hat for you, the way it normally looks when she gets out of the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you say with a half smile. With her sitting on the bed and you standing, you&#39;re just about eye level with her. She puts her hands on your waist and pulls you in close, kissing you again and inhaling in deeply through her nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell much better,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; you say, playfully rolling your eyes. You look over at the alarm clock, but you have to squint to see it from this distance. You can just barely make out the time, 10:15 P.M.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re almost there,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you may need glasses baby,&quot; you say, realizing how fuzzy the rest of the room is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve always been a little nearsighted, but lately it&#39;s been getting worse. I haven&#39;t had time to see the eye doctor yet. Having your 20/20 vision has been really nice today,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t notice this before now,&quot; you say. &quot;You know, I think you&#39;d look great with glasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I never thought so,&quot; she said. &quot;I always wanted to get contacts, but I don&#39;t like the idea of poking myself in the eyes twice a day just to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that,&quot; you say. &quot;But hey, maybe you won&#39;t have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Brooke looks down, realizing what you mean.<br />
<br />
You grab some of Brooke&#39;s clothes and head back into the bathroom. You change into a fresh pair of panties, a red tank top, and a pair of black booty shorts. Then you grab her brush and head back out, since you know she&#39;ll want her hair done a certain way and that you probably won&#39;t get it right.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to go into the bathroom to change babe, it&#39;s not like you have anything I&#39;ve never seen before,&quot; Brooke says, motioning for you to sit in front of her so she can work on your hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, it&#39;s just a habit I guess,&quot; you say, climbing onto the bed. Brooke removes the towel from your head and runs it over your hair once more to dry it off as much as possible. As she begins to work the brush through your hair, you feel yourself relaxing, enjoying the feeling of being taken care of. After a few minutes she finished and tosses the brush back onto the bed. She wraps her arms around you from behind, pulling you up to sit on her lap and resting her hands on your tummy. Placing your hands on top of hers, you know in that moment that no matter what happens, everything will turn out all right in the end.<br />
<br />
You squint over at the alarm clock again. 10:27 P.M.<br />
<br />
Any minute now...</p>
