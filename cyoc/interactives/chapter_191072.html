<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To be honest, Jeff felt the night went by very quickly as he hung inside his brother’s locker.  At first when he had realized that Ryan was going to be leaving him in the locker for the next day, he was worried.  After all, his brother had done plenty of complaining when it came to losing his speedo even while it was in his locker.  Jeff spent the whole evening worried that he would somehow be taken from his brother’s locker and that he would be stuck as someone else&#39;s speedo.  It was bad enough being his own brother’s speedo, and while he may like guys as well, he wasn’t sure how he would feel being worn by someone else.  But as the new day started and he heard voices outside the locker, he figured that he had apparently been worried for nothing.  Although all of his worry didn’t leave until Ryan came and unlocked the locker and reached for him.<br />
<br />
Similar to the day before, Ryan and his teammates each got into their speedos and made their way to the pool, ready for the tournament to be over.  Ryan reached down and adjusted the back of his speedo, absently thinking about a subtle way in which he could thank his brother for leaving his catalog open while not making it too obvious.  The speedo was a perfect fit and he had noticed that his swimming was a little bit less resistant, and he wasn’t sure if it was because of them or not.  But as he felt the pool water drip down him, and roll down the fabric, he felt like it didn’t really matter.  He had managed to secure two races in second place and one in third, out of his four races that was pretty good.<br />
<br />
As he and Damian watched Kaito finish his final race, Ryan couldn’t help but sigh in relief causing Damian to chuckle.  “Well it looks like this one is done finally,” he said as he stretched his arms.  “Now it’s time to finally relax.”<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded in response as they were joined by Mike and Aaron, “At least it’s the weekend now.  No need to do anything except rest our sore muscles.”<br />
<br />
Mike snorted and jerked his head at Kaito who was walking over, looking like he wanted to keel over.  “Especially that one there.  He’s probably going to be dead before we even leave the locker room.”  This caused them all to chuckle a bit, especially as Kaito glared at Mike having heard him as he got there.  They made their way over to the locker room with very little trouble and they each went to their lockers.  Aaron and Mike quickly both stripped down and headed towards the showers, while Damian seemed more focused on gathering his stuff together before heading to the showers.  Ryan glanced over his shoulder and had to bite on his tongue when he saw Kaito.  Mike’s prediction was pretty much on point, he had managed to take his speedo off halfway before falling asleep on the bench ass up.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Ryan turned back to his locker.  Usually he would take a shower and then head home, but right now he was exhausted and the idea of joining Kaito in unconsciousness was appealing.  So he decided to take the easy way, and instead of stripping off his speedo he grabbed his jeans and started to pull them on over him.  Jeff was certainly not expecting this, he had figured Ryan would take him off and he would be placed back in the bag to be brought home.  That wasn’t the case though as he felt himself being pressed even tighter against his brother’s cock, seeing the darkness envelop him once again as the zipper went up over him.<br />
<br />
Ryan shrugged his shirt on and grabbed his bag before closing and locking his locker.  Turning to Damian, he clapped him on the shoulder, “I’m heading out, message me if something comes up this weekend, yeah?”  Damian nodded and Ryan turned around right as he saw a mischievous light spark in his friend’s eyes as he saw Kaito’s position.  As Ryan made his way out of the locker room the last thing he heard was a smack of flesh on flesh, and Kaito’s startled scream followed by Damian’s laughter.  Shaking his head with a smirk, he made his way out of the building to his car to head home.</p>
