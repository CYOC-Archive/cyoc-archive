<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about a lovely group of deer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Angie snapped her fingers. Immediately, the naked scout girls felt tingling all over their bodies, as if things were bubbling underneath their skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-whoa! Our feet!!!&quot; exclaimed Gwen. The girls looked down at their legs, which were still hovering from the ground. Their soles and ankles were stretching longer, as if they were being pulled like soft putty. Their middle toes were fusing and swelling into two solid clumps, while the toes at the ends of each foot (their smallest toe and big toes) changed similarly, but shifted along their lengthening feet. These clumps took on a darker color with sharpened edges, while the inner flesh of their soles stayed pink and smooth.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird!!&quot; said Katie, as she and her friends wiggled their new deer&#39;s hind hooves around. Change was coming to their legs too, as their shins and lower-legs shrank while their calf muscles plumped up to large mounds of flesh. Little, reddish-brown hairs were growing out along the skin of their legs, and they soon sprouted into patches of fur that rapidly spread across their lower limbs. <br />
<br />
&quot;AH!&quot;, piped Holly. &quot;There&#39;s something right on my butt!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel it too!&quot;, said Sofia, as she tried twisting her body in midair for a look. And the girls saw it: above the crack of each of their butts, there grew a stubby lump of flesh, with fur quickly sprouting on them. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a tail!&quot; Sofia squealed giddily. &quot;We have tails!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re so cute!&quot;, laughed Gwen. The girls toyed their new appendages with their hands, and giggled as the parts wiggled on their own. They felt almost like big moving cotton buds, though they soon grew longer into bigger furry tufts, almost like white feather-dusters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. our hands are changing too!, remarked Katie. &quot;Look at our fingers!&quot;<br />
<br />
Their hands were changing too. The fingers were shortening into little clumps of paw-pads, while the nails grew long into hoof-like points. This came with their arms getting longer and fur-colored as well, matching the length of their legs.<br />
<br />
As they flailed their strange changing arms, the girls giggled even more as they saw each other&#39;s ears. They shifting higher up their heads, growing longer, hairier and pointed to match their new species. Like their tails, they could even wiggle them about. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re really going to be deer!&quot;, exclaimed Holly, as she and her scout-mates marveled at their new cute additions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are!&quot;, said Angie. The woman was circling around the happy girls from below. &quot;You girls are now becoming female white-tailed deer! Well, Sofia gets a little bonus...&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Angie gestured to Sofia. The little girl was confused, but gasped as she felt something below.<br />
A red, fleshy nub was pushing out from the top of her vagina, and was swelling rapidly. Whatever it was, it made Sofia shiver pleasantly as it parted her virgin slit. Sofia shivered even more as her vagina&#39;s folds magically wrapped around the growing member like a pocket, with its pointed tip exposed. Below, two large bumps were growing under the skin, and bloated out like a pair of balloons stuck together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow...&quot;, uttered Katie, as she and the other girls stared at Sofia&#39;s new part in awe. &quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re growing a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A penis!&quot; said Angie, cheerfully. &quot;That&#39;s right, Sofia&#39;s going to become a boy deer! A handsome stag, with a lovely toy to play with.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sofia didn&#39;t reply. Looking down at her new sheathed member, the child couldn&#39;t help but touch it. Sofia let out a pleasured breath as her fore-hoof brushed upon the tip. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel?&quot;, Gwen asked. Sofia tried finding words to describe it, but instead moaned out a high-pitched sound. Angie and the other girls found this funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s time for you girls to try testing your new legs out,&quot; said Angie. With another gesture of her hands, the transforming girls were lowered towards the ground, with their bodies tilting forth along with their new ungulate limbs. They were released just a few inches from the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof!!,&quot; grunted Katie, as she landed with the rest of her Cabin-mates. The four girl scouts found themselves standing quite perfectly on their four hooves. Though their torsoes were still mostly human shaped, albeit now covered in fur, the girls were now stuck in a quadruped position. <br />
<br />
Carefully, Gwen took her first steps, followed by Holly, Sofia and Katie. It was strangely easy to do, even though they knew how different it was from walking as a human. They knew how to balance their hooves, and move their limbs in sync, almost as if they were always born in these bodies. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool!” exclaimed Sofia, as she trotted forth, feeling her new member bobbing underneath with each step. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s easy!&quot;, said Holly, laughing, as she pranced around with her friends. With Miss Angie watching from the sidelines with a smile, the girl scouts happily trotted around the forest clearing. Amidst their new movement, the girls found the rest of their bodies reshaping even further. Their line of vision grew higher as their necks grow longer and bulked up, letting them angle their heads better. The overall size of their bodies increased, with their child-sized chests and ribs bulking out to fit the frames of young adult deer. Their nipples even shifted down to their abdomens, with their new teats poking out. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re getting bigger!&quot;, remarked Katie, as she noticed herself suddenly looking further from the ground, with legs feeling more powerful than ever. The girls were ecsatic. They felt so full of energy! <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, girls, gather around!&quot;, beckoned Miss Angie. The deer-girls obeyed, and they happily gathered in front of their Cabin Mother. By now, the girl scouts of Cabin 4 resembled a group of normal deer, but with the heads of preteen girls; complete with their normal hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at yourselves, you&#39;re all such beautiful animals now!&quot;, said Angie. The girls were looking curiously at each other&#39;s new selves, and were excited for what&#39;s to come. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we have antlers?&quot;, asked Gwen.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, only male deer grow antlers,&quot; said Angie. &quot;Which brings us to our stag. Sofia!&quot; <br />
<br />
Eagerly, Sofia stepped up to Miss Angie. Her new maleness was back in its sheath, but Angie knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before it emerges again. And Sofia&#39;s going to be quite busy with it. <br />
<br />
“Now, since you’re learning to be one with nature as deer, you’re going to learn a few things about deer reproduction. That means you, Sofia, are going to be mating with these lovely deers here.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Mating??&quot;, Katie asked. &quot;Wait...do you mean sex???&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie chuckled. &quot;That&#39;s right! Stags need to breed with their mates, to produce more deer. There&#39;s a special way that deers attract mates, and you&#39;re all going to try it today! With Sofia!&quot;<br />
<br />
All eyes turned towards Sofia, as her cheeks went a bashful pink. <br />
<br />
&quot;But before that, let&#39;s make Sofia fit the part, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
More magic came. Sofia felt two nubs growing out through her blonde hair, and they soon sprouted into long, branch-like structures that curved backwards, ending with pointed (but smoothed out) tips. Sofia blinked as she felt the weight of her antlers, and she carefully moved her head around to get used to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;, Holly remarked, as she and the other deer girls admired Sofia&#39;s majestic antlers. &quot;Those look so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I really look like a boy deer now?&quot;, asked Sofia, grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost!&quot;, said Angie. Another tingle came, and Sofia&#39;s neck grew thicker than the other girls, while her body grew slightly more bigger and muscular than her scout-mates. A thick pelt grew in the front of her neck and chest, while the blonde hair on Sofia’s head (and its two long braids) evaporated into magic dust. Her bald scalp was replaced by fur like the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it! A proud prince of the forest., but still with a cute little face.&quot; said Angie, cheerful at her handiwork. &quot;Do you like it, Sofia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Sofia nodded her antlered head. Her antlers almost felt like she was wearing a crown! Though Sofia still felt like a girl, she felt more powerful, more thuggish. More willing to dominate, and to show off! It wasn&#39;t anything like she was before, and she liked it! <br />
<br />
&quot;Sooooo...&quot; Holly spoke up, &quot;are we gonna mate now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Angie laughed. &quot;Of course! But here&#39;s the thing...when deers mate, they don&#39;t just meet up and go at it! There&#39;s a time of year when female deer go into a state called &#39;estrus&#39;, where they get a higher urge to mate. When they do this, female deer put out a special chemical called a &#39;pheromone&#39;, which male deer can smell. And this can get them CRAZY for rutting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But the male deer can&#39;t just have the female deer, no. If there&#39;s other males around, then they may have to fight over her. And the female deer don&#39;t just give themselves to the stags, they need them to chase!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chase?&quot;, the girls all uttered (including Sofia). <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. You girls need to get Sofia to follow you, and play &#39;hard to get&#39;! He&#39;s gotta earn the right to you, after all. I&#39;ll give you instructions on what to exactly do. But first, let&#39;s put you in heat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Angie snapped her fingers. Suddenly, the three does&#39; of the group felt a warm, tingly feeling bubbling inside them. Their hearts beat faster, and they felt a sudden hunger in their loins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god....&quot;, Katie uttered, as she, Gwen and Holly staggered on their hooves for a moment. The girls all shuddered pleasantly, as they felt their new heat take over.<br />
<br />
And with that heat was a musk that reached Sofia&#39;s nose. It was heavy, and enticing, and it made her penis throbbing harder, as it emerged from its sheath and pointed out. Her balls also grew a little bigger, as they began churning with semen. Her eyes glanced over at the rear ends of her Cabin-mates. She wanted it. She wanted <i>them</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re feeling it, right?&quot;, quipped Angie. &quot;Now, for normal deer, this chase can go on for several days, until the female deer finds the stag worthy. But for us? Let&#39;s keep it to just fifteen minutes. Gwen? Holly? Katie? Get ready to run around in different directions. Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready!&quot;, they all replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;And....GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that signal, Gwen bolted away, with Katie and Holly following suit. Sofia reacted fast, and charged after one of them. Miss Angie giggled, as she watched the chase unfold. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck!&quot;, called Angie. &quot;Remember: stay in the general area, and try making him catch you!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the deer vanished into the forest, Angie took a moment to be proud of herself. Though she did feel a bit guilty about violating her probation, and her promise to Catherine. Not to mention the virginities of four little girls. <br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Oh, they&#39;ll have fun&#39;</i>, thought the witch-woman. She&#39;s absolutely sure of it. Quickly, though, Angie put up several spells at once. One was to ensure the four girls would keep to this forest, and avoid the nearby camp. The other was a mental connection to all four girls, so Angie could tell them what to do, and also change their forms even from far away.<br />
<br />
And then there&#39;s one other special spell she put on Sofia. Something neither the stag nor his mates would notice.</p>
