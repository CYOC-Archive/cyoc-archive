<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><center></center>As Dustin passed a small café, his stomach grumbled. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to grab a quick bite, so he ducked inside and ordered himself a toasted sandwich, sparing a short glance at the twink that handed it to him. The clerk certainly would get a surprise when he came home to his boyfriend tonight. Happy with his handiwork, Dustin sat down at a table and began to eat.<br />
<br />
As he munched away at his sandwich, Dustin glanced around the café for more victims. The roguish man trying to chat up the barista? Well, he was already cocky enough. The trio of old men having tea together? While that one was tempting, another, more interesting option appeared. A woman, mousy brown hair pulled up into a ponytail, glasses, slightly freckled skin and a blush dusting her cheeks. A man, blond hair and blue eyes, and an average build tucked away in a comfortable gray hoodie. The two were laughing as the man shared a video with her, before pressing a light kiss to her cheek. Dustin smiled. This was exactly what he had been looking for.<br />
<br />
<center>~~~~~~~~~~</center><br />
<br />
Alex stared at Hailey lovingly. The date had been going well so far, every joke making Hailey laugh harder, and every word she spoke making him fall deeper in love with her. And then, the moment dawned on him, when the sunlight hit her just right, encapsulating her in an angelic golden glow, her smile gleaming and perfect, her voice a tinkling bell, and he knew that he had to marry this woman. He felt a stir in his pants, and looked around for something, anything that might service as a ring, just until he could buy her something nice. There was another tug at his pants, and his cock seemed to strain to be free. He frowned. It wasn&#39;t usually that tight, maybe his underwear had shrunk in the wash. Shrugging it off, he continued to search.<br />
<br />
Just as he thought he&#39;d found something at least vaguely toroidal, he heard a gasp from Hailey. He looked up at her. Her brown eyes were blown wide as one hand clutched the table, the other snaking down towards her crotch. A quick peek under the table revealed a much larger bulge in her shorts than she&#39;d ever had before. Alex placed his hand on top of hers, snapping her out of her trance. &quot;Alex, honey,&quot; she blurted. &quot;I think we need to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why? You haven&#39;t even finished your lunch!&quot;<br />
<br />
As he spoke, though, he could see her getting more and more panicked, her breaths coming in shorter and shorter bursts. &quot;Look, I just think it would be a good time to get out of heeere- oooh!&quot; She broke off into a moan, keeling over the table. <br />
<br />
Alex quickly moved to support her. &quot;Hailey? Speak to me. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, hon, I have no - <em>ohhhhh</em> - idea.&quot; Alex could feel her hand beneath his as it began to grope at her crotch. With each second, <br />
the bulge in her pants seemed to grow larger and larger, until their knuckles were grazing the underside of the table. &quot;But please, we need to go home!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright. Let&#39;s get you to the car. Do you need help walking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey nodded as she wobbled on her legs trying to get up. &quot;Everything feels so goooood, Allie. I&#39;m all shaky and horny- ooooh!&quot; By now, she was moaning loud enough that the patrons around were taking notice. Alex blushed and hooked one of her arms over his head, hurriedly carrying her out to the car. He placed her in the passenger seat and was about to do up her seatbelt, when he noticed the enormous bulge straining to escape her pants. With a <em>ping!</em> her button flew off, allowing the zipper to undo and expose the hot, throbbing mass of flesh barely restrained in her underwear. Alex watched in horror as even that those failed, the pink fabric tearing and exposing what was underneath.<br />
<br />
One ball, then another, fell out against her thighs, each one the size of an orange. Then, a pink, mushroom-shaped head snaked out, followed by inch after inch of thick, turgid man-meat. Five inches, six, seven. Alex&#39;s eyes bugged out of his head as his girlfriend revealed her newly-grown dick, which absolutely dwarfed his. Fourteen, fifteen, <em>sixteen</em> inches of hard-on protruded from Hailey&#39;s crotch. The girl in question could barely think from all the new and strange sensations that assaulted her mind. All she knew was that she had a needy, throbbing cock and it felt fucking fantastic.<br />
<br />
While, Alex shakily climbed into the driver&#39;s seat, he could barely keep his eyes off his girlfriend&#39;s enormous penis as she thrust into the dashboard, lathering pre-cum over the fabric. &quot;Come on, Hails, we just need to get you home,&quot; he muttered. Hailey only offered a moan in reply. Gripping the wheel with tightly-gripped hands, Alex whispered a prayer under his and pulled out of the parking lot, beginning the frantic race home before his girlfriend painted the inside of his car white.<br />
<br />
<center>~~~~~~~~~~</center><br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I have to say, your imagination is pretty twisted,&quot; Ty said, startling Dustin as he appeared next to him. &quot;But seriously hot. I like your style.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess?&quot; Dustin replied, trying to keep his gaze away from his brother. &quot;Any reason you decided to scare the shit out of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned. &quot;Only to give my approval. And to make an offer. I have the ability to make us both invisible, and transport us anywhere in the world. What do you say we follow those two and mess with them a little more?&quot;</p>
