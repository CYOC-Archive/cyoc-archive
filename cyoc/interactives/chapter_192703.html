<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everything had begun a month ago, around half-a-year after you turned nineteen and following its own changes in your body as you rapidly aged. First you felt your clit begin to throb and push out of the hood as turned into a real &#39;peepee.&#39; Then it was your breasts that felt swollen and uneven which you didn&#39;t like at all as you had to constantly adjust your bra, even buying a cupsize larger had barely helped. Less so now though and the doctors said they likely wouldn&#39;t push past a modest B-cup. <br />
<br />
Worst of all were your nipples which were constantly aching and making it hard to sleep. You felt sure they wouldn&#39;t stay that way unless it subsided soon. Although it wasn&#39;t one of your immediate concerns currently.<br />
<br />
You splayed your legs a bit wider and adjusted the aim over the toilet that had its seat folded up. The sudden feeling of your thin fingers touching your sensitive penis flooded your body with a strange heat. “Uhhhh... It&#39;s throbbing and becoming hard again.” You whined, sending a plaintive look at your twin sister, who only seemed to have eyes for the thing growing in length between your legs, for support. “Can&#39;t you look at your own instead, Maia. You&#39;re making me feel weird.” <br />
<br />
Exposing yourself in front of her filled you with the same warmth as touching your penis did. Part of you wanted to stop, but your fingers continued to move on their own and your hips were beginning to tremble. It felt unfair, she had been born first so she should be the one showing you. And now instead of peeing as you did before you went to bed last night would do it in this weird way.<br />
<br />
A pressure begun to build in the base of your penis. A yelp escaped your lips. You tried to desperately hold it back, only lasting less than ten seconds before you felt the rush and then the relief and the sound of a flowing river. Your sister had leaned forward, looking down at the liquid stream that came out of you. The tie around her bathrobe had fallen away, revealing her entire naked body. It was too much! All you wanted to was bury your head in your hand and forget about everything. So you did, releasing your grip around your penis which continued to flow– except now the stream went everywhere besides into the toiletbowl.<br />
<br />
Once things settled your breath hitched and caught, but you kept the tears from your eyes at least. And your twin was there, hugging you tightly against her body. Her lips were close to yours, her breath hot against your skin. Like everything else, things were changing between you. But you minded these changes less as you snatched a kiss from her lips. Only fair after what she made you suffer through. You turned around, cupping her cheeks while maintaing the kiss. Your mind was already floaty as it was carried away by her soft exploration. <br />
<br />
The moment was interrupted by a high-pitched and cute voice calling from the other side of the bathroom door. Not that you had any room to call others&#39; voices cute. The doctor&#39;s knocking was quite insistent, she must have been at it for a while. You giggled at the sheer absurdity of the situation and felt the a tear make its way down your cheek. You quickly brushed it away, feeling much better now.<br />
<br />
““Coming!””  You and your twin said in perfect synchronicity. You dressed quickly, making sure the bathrobe was tight and snuggly around your thin and slightly curved waist. Being identical twins with the same large and expressive golden eyes, soft and rounded features and lithe bodies with porcelain skin, you both found different ways to let others tell you apart. So you helped your twin adjust her ass-length raven hair, tying it into a pair of twintails. You kept yours straight<br />
<br />
Outside the little girl genius was waiting. She was holding a clipboard and wearing an oversized pastel pink labcoat. So adorable! She adjusted the fake glasses sitting on her the bridge of her nose before looking at both of you. A beaming smile painted her lips. It set your heart racing, the thudding in your ear almost drowining out what she said. <br />
<br />
“After scoring your written tests we only found a barely noticeable dip in intelligence. While the progression of most of your physical changes are slowing to a crawl. Still monstrous transformations are only mildly affected at this stage and shouldn&#39;t be far away. Same with sexual urges. In line with our other volunteers. Maia, Mara. Our conclusion is that you&#39;re both healthy and suffered no significant ill effects, so we&#39;ll continue to administer the gene therapy and then we&#39;ll meet again next month for our second check up.” <br />
<br />
You and your twin were excitedly hugging each other again as soon as she finished, happily bouncing up and down. And then your doctor was also included  in your celebration. She resisted, at first, but no one escapes the cuddle pile and she soon relented!<br />
<br />
Instead of going to the &#39;The Quarry,&#39; you and Maia had both been lucky enough to be admitted to the one active medical trial trying to contain the worst changes of the transformation. Contain, since everyone had given up hope of reversing it decades ago. Some even argued against trying to fully reverse it. Being identical twins meant you were both able to cut through the massive line. Though it hardly meant you were entirely free and still had to isolate outside of specific circumstances and tests. <br />
<br />
The premises of &#39;The Institution&#39; itself, a refurnished beachside hotel and its accompanying grounds and a fenced few streets, were much nicer and amongst the best your society could manage these days. It even had a handful working solar panels!</p>
