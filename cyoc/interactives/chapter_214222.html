<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today was the day they would begin transferring the unwanted build up in Selicia’s collection to the new storefront behind the manor. Selicia strode down the hall toward where the bulk of her extra keepsakes were being stored currently. Passing Marina’s room, she peered in on her young head maid who at this time was busying herself with the dollhouse she’d been given some days prior. She seemed enraptured in whatever made up scenario she was playing out. Amusingly whatever she’d been doing had seen former daughter of the household straddling a thin model stand. The young woman was just as bare as she was when Selicia put her back in the house.<br />
<br />
Selicia approached Marina to get a better look at her little house play taking note of the entire scene. The daughter’s leg kept the stand’s pole pressed firmly against her parted lips and between her modest breasts. Seems her current role was that of a stripper in this game. Whereas the former mother was stripped down with only her panties pulled down to her bent knees. She was in the midst of giving on the serving men oral by the looks of it as he was seated with her head in his lap. Inside the house, the other serving man was being ridden face and lap by the two serving women left bare to the world. Only the former head of household was left out, however from where he was sat, he would be able to see everything~ There was a chorus of moans and pitiful cries as they lamented or enjoyed their current situation.<br />
Marina froze up as she made an adjustment to the mother pressing her tiny hand against her vagina. She seemed to finally catch on that she was no longer alone and slowly turned to face Selicia. Selicia merely gave her a snide smile as she might’ve been expecting before Marina swept the dolls unceremoniously into their home. Quickly spinning around and standing up with a furious blush on her face, Marina spoke first.<br />
<br />
“M-Mistress! What brings you to my room?! Was I… Was I tasked for something already? I… I will get-” She was hushed as Selicia pressed a gentle finger to her lips. Meekly she spoke again as the finger left her lips. “You saw everything, didn’t you…?” Her blush increased with a fury as Selicia’s grin widened. Shriveling up with embarrassment she managed to keep her eyes locked with Selicia’s.<br />
<br />
“Dear… I never said anything to shame you, if anything, I’m surprised of you~ You know who those are and yet here you are… Playing house with them as if they were common toys. Albeit rather lewdly~” Peeking past Marina seeing the dolls tangled into each other after being swept aside. The former daughter’s face crammed into her former mother’s sweet spot especially tickled Selicia. “I suppose since you haven’t asked for it and you’re due for it as is… You may take the day off to enjoy your toys however you might. I’d advise closing your door however especially if you’re enjoying them quite that much~”<br />
<br />
Marina bowed quickly before thanking Selicia and awaiting dismissal. With a wave, Marina turned back to her toys slowly and cautiously pulling them apart. Selicia made her way out of the room and closed the door for the young woman. With a shake of her head, Selicia quietly took her amusement with her. She’d let the poor thing save face by not mentioning the wet mark on her underwear while she was knelt over. Apparently, she was enjoying them quite a bit more than she wanted to let on.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, Selicia rang the bell and waiting for the other serving staff members to gather. She’d summarily dismissed all but, two of them, Lisa and Min. The pair stood silently awaiting their orders before her.<br />
<br />
“Lisa. Min.” As they stood attentively, Selicia continued. “I’m tasking the pair of you with taking the lighter items and therefore the bulk of them to the storefront. Task the men with carrying the larger and heavier items later… For now, follow me.” She walked out of the manor through the back hallway and toward the storefront with the pair in tow.<br />
<br />
After arriving at the storefront’s backdoor, she waved her hand causing the locked door to open inward to the backroom. The next few moments saw the three of them into the currently concealed front area where she addressed them again. “I want this area to host the bulk of the items. I trust the two of you can manage to arrange them in a satisfactory manner?” With their nods, Selicia made to leave them to their work but, not before setting a simple trip alarm spell at the backdoor. Did she believe anyone would actually try anything? No… However recent events have left her still feeling a bit cautious… If anyone did, she’d know and she’d deal with them accordingly~ With that she left the pair to their task and took on her own task of setting aside the inventory to be transported that wasn’t already set to move…<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
From this point the story will follow a pair of college students name Maya and Brea. Maya is a 5’11, black haired, sun kissed tanned young woman of age 22. Under her short bangs are amber colored eyes, her healthy framed body sporting C cupped breasts, and thick thighs. She is wearing a gray tank top, a pale blue dress shirt around her waist, cut off blue shorts, and dark blue sneakers. Brea is 6’1, Brunette, with fair freckled skin and age 23. Her long hair frames her forest green eyes, her body is thinner due to her height with D cupped breasts, and more modest thighs. She’s wearing a red and white checkered shirt with buttons undone to mid chest, blue jeans, and calf high boots.<br />
<br />
Brea sat with Maya as they watched a pair of maids carrying boxes from that large manor to the small storefront behind it. They’d been talking across the street when they saw the tall mystery woman bring them across that yard. Maya’s home was situated across the street from that empty store for years, so from her balcony was where they watched the trio at first. Since then, it was a back and forth with the maids and occasionally some men carrying a much larger item down. The sudden use of the store was a curiosity and more so with that huge decal. A very big image of a young woman in a French maid outfit smiling out toward them. They’d gotten a feel for their back and forth to get a sense of when they’d be back again.<br />
<br />
Brea smiled mischievously at Maya, tilting her head toward the store briefly. “Ya wanna go check it out? ~” Seeing Maya’s expression go from a hard stare to a roll of her eyes just made Brea grin wider. “Oh come on, ya gotta be just a bit curious don’tcha?” Again, Maya stared at Brea flatly before sighing and shaking her head. “Ah. I know what yer thinkin’ You wanna go see, don’tcha lie to me~” Muttering under her breath Maya locked eyes with Brea.<br />
<br />
“So what if I am? You’re suggesting we trespass on my neighbor as if it’s the right thing to do.” Maya’s face went flat as Brea just grinned and nodded. “What do you propose we do if we get caught?”<br />
<br />
“Well… Them maids don’t look like much, so I reckon we can just bolt through’em~” Brea snickered as she gestured the idea by smacking her hands together and thrusting the aggressive hand forward. “Just like that, if it’s got an alarm it’s bound to be off if they’re going in an’ out like that. So what’cha say we go look?” Grinning ear to ear, Brea knew if she kept the pressure on that Maya would cave. She always did even when they first met years ago. Three… Two… One… And… There! Maya rolled her eyes and stood up from the patio table.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go before I change my mind and my parents kill us later…” Maya strode into her house and out the front door with an excited Brea at her side.<br />
<br />
Brea and Maya waited along the side wall for the maids to leave again just out of casual sight. When the pair of maids had gone just out of sight themselves, Brea and Maya hurriedly and quietly made for the backdoor. Getting to the backdoor, they paused and looked for any obvious security measures before they stepped through the doorway. They didn’t stay in the back area long since it was pretty empty yet… When they got in the front area though, they were met with a plethora of naughty nick-nacks and such.<br />
<br />
“Would’ja just look at this place, Maya~ It’s chock full of all sorts of dirty bits.” Brea walked calmly toward the front windows attracted by the extremely sexy looking maid on this side of the glass. “Wow… It looks nothing like the other side, don’t it?” She ran her fingers along that window decoration lingering on the finely detailed clit for a moment. When they came to the front Maya strayed back a little as Brea boldly pushed forward. Feeling someone standing behind her again, Brea turned back with a smirk that quickly faded… Somehow at some point, that mysterious lady’d come back and boy was she stacked. Brea shook her head getting the important thing into mind, that was running of course… At least, she wanted to but, her legs weren’t moving. There was a gentle touch to her chest as that woman put a hand on Brea. Before Brea fully registered the oddity of the situation, the woman backed away regarding the two maids that had shown up as well.<br />
“Keep an eye on that one while you bring in the rest. Don’t worry about staying to watch her… She’s already been dealt with~” Said that mystery woman who didn’t even look back at Brea as she left.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, the maids looked at Brea with a casual glance before setting down boxes and leaving once more. Thoroughly freaked out, Brea made to leave as well but, found herself still rooted in place. She didn’t want to give away Maya if she hadn’t been caught already so instead of shouting, she looked about for her. Maya must’ve hidden good since she was nowhere to be seen… That was good, now all she had to do was get moving… As she struggled to even jerk her body, Brea made her first scary realization. Everything around her was getting taller, not crazy quickly so it took her a moment but, fast enough now.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t move her head to look around so she looked with her eyes best she could. That’s when she realized her legs were pretty much melting beneath her. Already she was down to her knees, her boots nowhere to be seen either. Now, she tried to call out for Maya hoping she could save her somehow. Still that girl was nowhere to be seen… Had she been caught first? Ah hell… What’d she get the two of them into? Her legs had stopped melting but, her hips had slid forward leaving her able to see her slit perfectly underneath her breasts. Seemed like her shorts just vanished while she wasn’t looking.<br />
<br />
The whole process must’ve been taking awhile because them maid girls had been back and forth twice now. Brea had tried to plead with them but, they just looked at her and left both times. By now, even her arms had shriveled into her body leaving shirt to slump and disappear as it slid downward. She could feel the floorboards under her puckered asshole now. Whatever was melting her was also rearranging her as it wanted. Once that part of her was against the floorboards it gaped wide puckering to the floor itself. If she could’ve she’d have shuddered with that feeling. It was soon over taken by the return of that shrinking feeling.<br />
<br />
This time the shrinking was a more complete deal as everything grew in size, not just in height. It was especially driven home as the maids returned looking like giants. They looked at her a little longer this time giving a slight glimmer of hope before they left again… Maybe this was all in her head, some weird mold or something in the air… Yeah… This couldn’t be really real… Maya was just over there toward the far end of the shop… Wait… Maya! There was Maya directly across from her, unharmed and still normal! Making to plead with her friend, Brea tried to speak only to find she couldn’t… She looked down with her eyes again seeing everything stop growing and saw something worse. There through her now widely parted lips, she could see through to the floor… Her freckled body was becoming see through… Looking over to Maya again with pleading in her eyes, Brea finally froze entirely as she became to see through the nose on her face.<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Maya had hidden quickly among the stock when she saw that mystery woman stride in toward Brea. She was fast and silent as if she just glided across the floor. That woman just put a hand on Brea and left her alone like it was nothing. Then she went to say something to those maids before leaving. It felt like she’d almost seen Maya, so she’d ducked further behind some of the stock and didn’t dare come out. Damn it… Why’d she let Brea convince her into this… Fuck! This was a bad idea… She didn’t hear the woman leave but, the two maids certainly did.<br />
<br />
Resolving to stay put until Brea came to get her, Maya hid next to a medium sized box… Since she was stuck waiting, she pried open the cardboard box and was met with the sight of variously colored and sized dildos! Recoiling from the surprise of plethora of toys, she stared a little harder a moment later. A few of them were really strangely shaped… Surely, they wouldn’t be used, Maya thought to herself as she took out one of the stranger ones.<br />
<br />
Holding the toy in her hands, she made out the shape that she was looking at. It wasn’t styled like a dick at all, it looked like a tiny statuette of a woman standing stock still. Another stockier one was a much different, this one was styled with no limbs but, a realistic vagina as its base. As she looked it over, her fingertips brushed the clit and it vibrated to life in her hands. Startled, she frantically tried to turn it off and waited to be caught… Yet, no one came for her… Still just to be cautious she kept hiding until one last toy caught her eye from in the box.<br />
<br />
This dildo wasn’t just shaped like a woman, it was perfectly detailed in every way. It looked as if they’d shrunk a woman down and made her into rubber. The realism was so uncanny, Maya jumped as she heard a box placed nearby to her. She had to catch the toy before it flew out of her hands in surprise. Brea had to see this one, it was scarily real looking. Waiting for the maids to leave again, she made to look out to where Brea was earlier. Maybe, she was waiting for her to leave with just a warning from that lady… Maybe…<br />
<br />
That thought died in her mind as she looked out to see what had taken Brea’s place. There was a tiny little effigy on the floor that was slowly becoming translucent as she watched. It was colored just like Brea looked as she made an impossible connection… It didn’t just look like Brea, it was Brea! Then that meant! She threw the toy back in the box and scrambled away from the box. Just how many people had ended up like that?! What the hell was going on in here?! No… She didn’t think she could do anything about Brea anymore… Best she could do is get out of here and tell someone!<br />
<br />
She gave Brea one last sorrowful look as the translucence had fully taken her friend now. Making for the backdoor fast as she could while dodging potential victims, she almost made it unseen. Just as she’d gotten to the door, the maids returned and they definitely saw her. Fear caused her to back away, what if they could do the same to her? No… No… No, she didn’t want to be a toy… There was so much more to her life yet! As she ran back into the front room, the maids seemed unbothered by her presence. In fact, the one in the lead came over after placing her box down and approached her.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” The maid asked a bit stiffly seemingly curious about Maya.<br />
<br />
Maya just shook her head as she curled up against the door to the front of the store. As the maid approached, she shrunk slower to the door. The maid cautiously reached out a hand and pat Maya’s shoulder gently once she couldn’t move any further away.<br />
<br />
“There, there. It’ll be ok.” The maid smiled gently though her words were still a bit stiff. “You’ll be just fine, I promise.”<br />
<br />
Some reason this seemed to oddly calm Maya, who relaxed against the door frame. Her breathing was coming easier now and her heartbeat was normalizing. Once the maid moved away from Maya, she relaxed even more. Everything was going to be fine… She was going to do her best… It was at this point that her hands melded with her wrists and her feet with her ankles. It went beyond her notice what was happening to her now. The maids had turned away and left, yet she laid there calming down. Everything was going to be fine after all.<br />
<br />
A dreamy feeling overtook her as her calves and forearms melded upward. Maya could just feel that it was all a dream now, it must be… There’s no such thing as magic after all let alone something that could turn people into toys… The maids had returned and the other one just stared at her before waving a hand in front of her still face. When the hand passed there was a sort of gentle smile that seemed to placate Maya even more. They left without much more interaction beyond that of her strange smile.<br />
<br />
Her arms had melded away into her torso and her legs up to her ass leaving her unable to flee anymore. Certainly, if she wanted to, she could hop away but, this dream would end soon. Everything would be fine and Brea would come visit like normal. That relaxing feeling amplified as she felt herself slump against the door. Now things began to get bigger as her soft body shrunk and dragged her head down the glass of the door. This time when the maids came back they were gigantic, especially the mystery woman… Getting a better look at her like this… She was gorgeous from her looks to her stride as she came over to Maya.<br />
<br />
Effortlessly, the gargantuan woman picked Maya up in her hand that just barely didn’t wrap around her waist. As she lifted Maya off the floor, her body bent over backwards without support. Her head lolled quickly backward facing the now upside-down door. Another hand propped her head up to face the gorgeous giant. She was smiling at Maya but, not in a kind way like the maids had. No, this was where the dream became a nightmare…<br />
<br />
“I had half expected you to go try and save your friend~ If you had at least you’d have been together before your changes finished. And yet, you tried to leave her behind… Just another toy to be sold like the rest…” She carried Maya with her as she crossed the store with her in hand.<br />
<br />
Maya felt the woman’s fingers ply into her body as if she was made of some extra cushiony material all though out. What’s more, she felt increasingly hollow and like she could feel her inner walls touching each other acutely. As her head momentarily lolled forward, she saw that her body had become translucent like Brea’s had. She could make out a pair of tunnels going from her large vagina and another behind it. It was partially obscured by the deep tan color of her body but, she could even make out the shadow of the hand holding her. So she’d become something like Brea had… What a wild nightmare this was.<br />
<br />
Soon she was slumped forward planting her chin against her incredibly soft breasts as the woman bent over to pick something up. A moment later, Brea was in her opposite hand looking almost clear as fair as her freckled skin was. The woman carried them back to where she’d picked up Maya and paused for a moment appraising them. Maya watched as the woman placed Brea firmly on the counter top and scooted her side to she before gripping her upper body and pulling. Brea was stuck firmly in place without even budging an inch. Seeing Brea as she was and how she’d stuck to the counter made Maya realize what she was… Based on that she knew what was next to come…<br />
<br />
Before that however the woman waved her hand producing a whole new object seemingly out of nowhere. It was a sign of some sort on a long stand that came down and the back upward about an inch from itself. That end was a cylinder half as thick as Brea and she held it in place behind her friend. With a nod to the stiffly face maid, she came and held that one in place as the woman produced a bottle in that hand. The clear liquid drenched both Brea and the end of the sign copiously before she was regarded again at last.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Darling it’s going to be quite cold I’m afraid… However its to ensure you have a very tight fit with ease, I assure you~” The giant woman said with a assuring smile before sliding Maya down over Brea.<br />
<br />
Maya wanted to scream and roll her eyes into her head as the cold rods that were Brea and the sign entered her slowly and deeply. Her body demanding to shiver with chill and ecstasy as she was penetrated for the first time. She could feel Brea’s firm head reaching up to her breasts inside of her as their clit’s met at Brea’s base. A finger budged between them causing Maya’s head to swim with colors slowly shifting in her view. As her vision returned from the unreleased orgasm, she’d realized the colors were real… She could see just down to her breasts that changed hues from an inner light she couldn’t make out. At least, this seemed to be the end to the nightmare… Any moment now, she’d wake up in her bed with a knock at the front door~<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Selicia nodded in appreciation at the second official decoration for the store. Those two little trespassers made a perfect duo to advertise one of the policies they would offer. The foot tall head and torso onahole was held up by a novelty light up suction dildo. She was doing a fine job of propping the sign behind her that read; “Early Bird Specials! First Come, First Served!” Selicia made the sign to be held up that way so the poor thing didn&#39;t have to feel even the slightest bit empty~ With a little more effort, the store would be open to the curious public and she hoped… That there was certain more curious people like these two lovely volunteers~</p>
