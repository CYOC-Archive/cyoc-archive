<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Bitch…”<br />
<br />
It was not a word that Joel wielded easily or flippantly. He appreciated female dogs as some of the most loyal and cunning animals. Alyssa was welcome to vent and get mad. But to force him into this was not cool. Casually, Joel removed the last of her clothes and stood there stark naked.<br />
<br />
She was skinny, with her ribs obvious below those modest breasts. On second thought, maybe she was being unkind to them. They seemed like they had the potential to fill perhaps a D-cup and definitely a C-cup. Their prominent hang displayed the same confidence she felt from her regular chest. Below, she had sprawling hips despite her skinny body and no hair down there. For emphasis, she went from jiggling her new tits to sliding slender hands across the shape of her sex. Alyssa appeared especially dissatisfied that he wasn’t disconsolate. <br />
<br />
“You going after my man, Dunc, next?” Joel accused. Alyssa raised her dark eyebrows and nervously shot her gaze around. Duncan, who still gave the events a wide berth, looked up in surprise that he had even been invoked. He appeared as though he really wanted to look at what Joel was showing off but resisted. <br />
<br />
Jess came over to Joel soon after and asked to help him. Joel had no qualms about spending the rest of the day buck naked but welcomed her help as she led him over to other side of the car. Alyssa drifted over and scowled, as if to say her clothes were totally off-limits for loaners. <br />
<br />
Joel didn’t even wanna wear them anyway. Jess rummaged through her bag and came up with a pair of jeans so tight that Joel felt like they would’ve popped his balls like an overripe pimple and cracked his dick. Since he didn’t have either of those now, it just felt like the fabric was giving him a pelvic exam. Not a notion he wanted the dwell on. She had no clue how Jess squeezed into them without breaking some bones. That earned some kudos.<br />
<br />
For the top, fortunately, it was actually a pretty decent fit with a ring of her skinny stomach revealed and her boobs looking pretty decent. After slipping on a pair of flip-flops which only stayed on because she tightly gripped with her toes, Joel strolled close to Barry but still over an arms length away. Duncan and Alyssa moved over to the jetty and we’re quietly chatting. It didn’t look like Alyssa was going to shove him in but Joel honestly had no idea what she might do. She looked at Barry and dipped her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I am truly sorry, man. I fucked up and messed with bad spirit forces. Sorry you had to pay the price.” She didn’t advertise her words with a booming invocation. This was just for Barry. <br />
<br />
Barry tilted her face a few different ways and searched her with those gorgeous green eyes. After a minute, she nodded and answered, “Thanks for taking care not to split my head open.“<br />
<br />
Joel was glad she noticed. Carefully, she laid a hand on Barry’s shoulder. And that was that. Just because they looked like girls, didn’t mean they had to act like vendetta spewing, devious jerks. Jess eventually found and passed them a sizable hand mirror. They shared it to inspect themselves.<br />
<br />
Barry’s biggest surprise was seeing exactly how enormous her bust appeared no matter how she shifted her clothes. An ever-present, hot blush colored her features. Otherwise, she marveled at her shifted face and whispered, “I look like a model…”<br />
<br />
Joel reiterated her mention of ‘goddess’ and Barry gave a plaintiff squeak evocative of, but of a different character than when he startled geek boy Barry. The poor guy twisted between awe and looking mortified at the social implications. He could barely get a grasp on when he seemed to look decent as an early-age balding blonde man. Looking like a freaking sex bomb spun her with a tornado of bewildering emotions.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t as much of a shock for Joel to see herself. She knew she looked awesome as a man. What pestered her were the faint variations. She expected a pendulous, unearthly mountain of flesh jiggling from her chest. She assumed that instead of honed muscles, she would have the voluptuous curves of one of those classic clay figures from antiquity in celebrated museums. Instead, it all felt muted and insubstantial. <br />
<br />
She wondered if the difference came from immersion in the lake versus being splashed in the face. If Alyssa had robbed her of the full possibilities of her shape, then that was another indignity. It was weird to feel the desire for more of this but Joel figured if she was going to be stuck this way then she at least wanted the same head turning power as a woman she held as a man. <br />
<br />
She pondered and thought through what Duncan told them. He had said that a dip in this lake was some sort of permanent ritual. But that didn’t necessarily mean that you only got one opportunity. What if he wanted to re-roll his result, as Berry sometimes referred to with his table games? Duncan had said that there was a lot of history, folklore, and confusion when it came to the exact details of this place. Maybe he was just sugarcoating it for Barry but that didn’t necessarily mean he was off-base. <br />
<br />
At the same time, he had no idea what would happen. Maybe a second dip turns you into some kind of animal spirit and she’d wind up as a horny doe. A lot of myths and legends went for that kind of thing. Among her ideas for what to do, she could easily envision dropping her head, barreling towards Alyssa and tackling her off the jetty into the water.<br />
<br />
It was a pleasant thought, but she wasn’t going to do it. That was the kind of solution Alyssa would take. Get someone else into trouble. And then Alyssa would be the martyr and Joel would be a total pariah. <br />
<br />
She had to think. If all those wild feminists around college were to be believed, then Joel should’ve had some sort of mental boost from all this. The power of double X chromosomes and estrogen flooding her body should’ve naturally boosted her intelligence. <br />
<br />
She didn’t mind that. She just barely got through classes at the college. It was still all prerequisites. Jess wanted him to get a focus, somewhere in the sciences, but that was too heavy for him. She was going into psychology with a minor in linguistics. She always talked to him about all sorts of books she was reading on the side and they sounded good. But he couldn’t get more than a few pages before switching over to something funny on YouTube. Jess tried to explain that his difficulty focusing actually suggested some intelligence that they didn’t really have a “metric” for, but he suspected she was just being nice. <br />
<br />
He was a meathead, but it would’ve been kind of cool to know shit as well. Be able to talk to Jess about her books on the same level and not feel like a child talking to an adult. <br />
<br />
She didn’t immediately feel any smarter just from having a cleft between her legs, skinny limbs, and alright boobs. The water probably just translated what you already had, she figured. If so, then did that make her now a lesbian or did it shift over from the same deal and mean she was as hungry for cock as her manly-self loved pussy?<br />
<br />
Only Duncan was left with one between his legs. Thinking about the guy didn’t trigger any sudden epiphanies or feelings in her. But then it wasn’t like the ladies were all rushing to get a piece of him. However, Joel detected a presence in the air when the wind shifted over the water, blowing from the jetty towards them. From this distance, there wasn’t enough to tell. <br />
<br />
Leaving Barry to sit there and ponder, Joel got up and approached Alyssa and Duncan standing over the water on that old jetty. Alyssa brought her arms up as though she were about to pull out some karate moves. Joel snorted, held her hands up, and then put them behind herself. Alyssa didn’t back down but she lowered her hands a little.<br />
<br />
“Just curious”, Joel explained, then added. “I’m not gonna touch you, just investigating.”<br />
<br />
Duncan seemed to have no idea what was going on. He stepped back, checked where he was in relation to the water, and positioned himself at the center of the platform. Gingerly, Joel bent her head forward and took a strong whiff. There was definitely something there. Pressing her nose against his shirt allowed her to really catch the aroma.<br />
<br />
Alyssa made a indignant, muttering sound but didn’t say anything else. The scent didn’t seem all that different from regular guy sweat and the lingering remains of a masculine aroma. She wondered if her original clothes had any remnants of this. Get turned on by the man she used to be, next level narcissism. <br />
<br />
And there was something alluring in Duncan’s aroma. It was muted by the wind and perhaps by the kind of guy he was, but she could definitely detect something there. It was like being a wolf or some sort of attuned animal and this particular framework of scents triggered a feeling. It was pleasant and did something to her she never would’ve imagined before this moment.<br />
<br />
Joel bent up and kissed Duncan firmly on the lips. She held that position without wrapping her arms around his neck or pushing herself against him. He seemed too shocked to kiss back, but his lips twisted and yielded beneath hers. And Alyssa was freaking pissed off. She began kicking at her legs and looked like she wanted to use her blue nails on Joel’s face. <br />
<br />
Rushing up from the shore as Alyssa screamed at him, Joel noticed Jess joining them. The tussle, with a Duncan looking for the nearest pylon to grab onto, twisted and turned as Jess tried to pull Alyssa off of Joel. With an angry twisting elbow, Alyssa basically smacked Jess in the mouth. She staggered back and ran out of board underneath her. <br />
<br />
Pulling away from Alyssa, Joel yelled for Jess and jumped into the water after her. Somehow, neither of them hit the bottom. Joel knew that Jess was a poor swimmer, so she watched her head as she plunged beneath the water and struggled to support her head above the surface. Kicking and yelling, Joel carried her until there was enough beneath her feet to make it back to shore. Jess had already started changing though.<br />
<br />
Her clothes looked like she was going to burst out of them. Jess‘s neck practically seemed than both her original arms had been. This new version of her sure looked like he lifted. Her long hair receded on her head into a rough, dense, water-matted pile. The new man’s face was broad but clean-shaven. Lifting his too tight shirt up, Joel could see that he had broad pecs that stretched out so much they almost seemed like ghosts of her breasts. His legs were thick and about to split her pants. <br />
<br />
Arriving on the shore, Joel had a moment to assess that no changes had occurred to her. This was apparently what she got. She sighed and cast that off to make sure that Jess was alright. None of the new man’s clothes were going to last very long, so she carried him over to the car, where hopefully something in the sparse things he had packed as a man would be enough to keep her decent.</p>
