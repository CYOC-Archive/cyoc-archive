<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My clothes exploded, and I got extremely dizzy. It took me a second or two to adjust to my new perspective, and another second to realize what had happened. I was suddenly much, much larger than I had been moments ago. I looked down at Madame and the rest of the audience, stunned. Then my arms and feet stiffened in a weird way, I felt wobbly and off-balanced, and then I keeled over and landed with a thundering sound on the wide, flat bottom of my ... arms? ... front legs? ... whatever.<br />
<br />
-- I must weight a freaking ton now! -- I thought to myself. I couldn&#39;t help but notice that even on all fours I was much taller than anyone else here.<br />
<br />
I felt a swelling feeling and a surge of mobility at the end of my spine, and looked back and saw a long, slender tail hanging over my butt. I waved it around a few times, watching with wide eyes. I looked back at the Madame, my mouth wide open in astonishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like Jerry certainly has a knack for living large!&quot; she said to the audience. They laughed in amusement.<br />
<br />
-- What kind of spell are they under? -- I thought.<br />
<br />
Then my mouth was forced open as two of my front teeth pushed there way out. Soon they were so long that I could actually see them curving downward and outward in front of my face. Each tooth--no, tusk!--was probably as tall I used to be. I couldn&#39;t believe I had these things sticking out of my mouth! This woman was actually turning me into an animal!<br />
<br />
And yet she was still standing there, making casual quips to entertain her seemingly mindless audience. I could scarcely believe I had been one of them just a minute or so ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for showing us that nice toothy grin, Jer!&quot; she said with a wink. &quot;Sometimes to find true happiness, you&#39;ve just got to follow your nose!&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when my nose started to grow. Down over my upper lip it spread--no, it&#39;s replacing my upper lip!--then down, down, down, it stretched, longer and longer until it reached almost to the ground. I felt a tingling all the way down it like a limb that was regaining it&#39;s feeling after having been numb, but my mind was flooding with new sensations from a limb I&#39;d never had. I swirled it around, curled and stretched it, lifted it up over my head--this was surreal!<br />
<br />
Then my ears stretched out. They felt like big flat fans on the sides of my head! I was still watching my new nose bend to my will like a charmed cobra when my ears flapped for the first time. That pushed me over the edge. I raised my trunk up and trumpeted.<br />
<br />
-- Whoa that was loud! -- I thought. I was also surprised that it came as naturally to me as shouting. The audience applauded. Somehow I didn&#39;t really feel like being the center of attention right now.<br />
<br />
The Madame said something, but I just tuned her out. I was too mesmerized by my new body. I&#39;d always kind of liked elephants, but the last thing I expected was to actually turn into one at a magic show for real. If I had expected it, though, I would&#39;ve thought losing my thumbs and human arms would feel extremely limiting and debilitating. Instead I was actually really impressed by just how much of my body I could move with all four pillar-like legs planted firmly on the ground. I had these gigantic ears waving at the sides of my head, a trunk sticking out of my face that was at least as versatile as my human arms combined (and which I could breathe and make noises through, no less!), plus I still had that swinging tail all the way down at my back end. Not to mention that this enormous body was much more powerful now. I could probably crush Madame Illusia under one foot at this point--not that I would dare trying!<br />
<br />
If I had known more about elephants, I might have known what to expect next. Instead I thought my transformation was finished. I kinda liked it. I took a step forward to try walking with my massive new elephant body and then stopped in my tracks by a very unfamiliar sensation. There was a massive surge and a squirming sensation between my massive rear legs. Did I ... yes, I did ... I had another appendage! But what was it?<br />
<br />
Unnerved by the audience&#39;s collective gasp but undeterred, I turned around and looked back--I still couldn&#39;t get over how huge I was!--and looked at the slithering firehose-like thing that had wormed its way out of my groin. It took me a moment to register that it was actually my penis. At first it looked like I had grown a second trunk back there, and it kind of felt like it, too. If my nose had basically replaced my arms, this was like growing an extra pair. I could scratch my belly with this thing, for crying out loud!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when I remembered the audience was still watching. I turned my head to look at them. I would have been blushing in embarassment if I still had human cheeks. Some of the men in the audience stood up and cheered and shouted sarcastic sexual remarks. Madame made some sidecrack about third legs. I had been mostly ignoring my nudity until just now, but a look back at the ripped pieces of clothing reminded me just how low I had sunk. Just a naked beast on display. Boy I&#39;m really letting my inner animal out now, I thought sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Still hoping to regain some dignity, I held my cock as still as possible and looked for some way to make it less obvious. I thought back and remembered that it had literally felt like it was crawling out of my groin into the open air. I noticed it was hanging out of some kind of opening between my back legs. I found I could maneuver it backwards, pulling it back inside myself (this was so weird!) until it was tucked back inside a big fleshy pouch hanging under my crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat trick!&quot; someone from the audience shouted. I cried a little inside. Oh well, better than nothing. I looked back at the Madame, flopping my ears and waving my trunk from side to side. What was going to happen next?</p>
