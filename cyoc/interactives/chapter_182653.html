<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miss Fabina had her hands full these days. Above all else, she was trying to polish her tennis skills for the upcoming IAC. It has been years since she was in a serious competition, though having an Animalian body ought to help her get into shape quickly. She wasn&#39;t quite sure who she&#39;d be competing against. Especially since she has heard that Japan is reconsidering hosting the Olympics this year. While the pandemic has certainly lessened in a lot of places around the world, it was still going strong in others and not everyone had been vaccinated yet. As such, Japan might end up pushing the Olympic Games to 2022. Which wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea, all things considered. At least the IAC wouldn&#39;t have to split the spotlight between itself and the games.<br />
<br />
But even if the games weren&#39;t coming up, Miss Fabina was still busy enough with her regular work. For instance, there were some adult entertainment stars coming from France soon. Now that Juliet has been eased into the idea of having a nightclub built on her lands, the French government were sending some of their best adult entertainers who were willing to reboot their careers as Animalians. Miss Fabina wondered if the other European colonies would also be getting nightclubs. Well, the eventual Greek colony would certainly have one, but she was pretty sure Lord Chumlee and Countess de Vasconcellos would be put out about adding nightclubs to their lands. Fabina wondered if Macduff&#39;s Castle counted as an Animalian colony or not.<br />
<br />
But even putting aside foreign affairs, Miss Fabina still had more than enough to deal with right here. The three gyaru girls that had been sent to her from Heiya Island did not strike her as a particularly bright lot. A large part of that was because the three of them had baked themselves in tanning booths so much that their skin was almost orange and leathery and clearly suffering from melanoma. But another reason is that these girls didn&#39;t seem to have really learned their lessons. Their choice of Animalians seemed to be more about them being &#39;kawaii&#39; than anything meaningful. And they were still wondering how they&#39;ll be able to tan afterwards even though they&#39;ll be covered in fur. Fabina had half a mind to offer these girls to the French to get them off her paws.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Though perhaps the girls were not as dim as they appeared. While their choices of Animalians may have been mostly about how cute they were, but they did show quite a bit of knowledge about them, particularly since all three were animals with misleading names. For instance, the red panda isn&#39;t quite as closely related to the giant panda as was once thought. But then, pandas were thought to be more closely related to raccoons than bears. Eventually, the panda bear was confirmed to be from an odd branch of the ursu family. And the red panda itself was now to be more related to mustelids.<br />
<br />
The ringtail cat was also a misnomer. It was a member of the raccoon family, though it was built very differently from raccoons. They got their names more from their behavior than their relations. When miners and settlers moved into the American Southwest, the ringtails moved into their cabins and made themselves valuable by eating vermin. They quickly became accepted by humans much like how it was theorized early domestic cats did. As such, it was jokingly stated that ringtails and cats have domesticated humans.<br />
<br />
The tanuki is an animal that&#39;s often harder to describe to foreigners. They certainly resembled raccoons, though mostly for their faces. And there has been many times throughout history where they had been mistaken for badgers. Truthfully, they were actually an offshoot of the canid family, hence the proper term for them is raccoon dogs. Anyways, tanukis have been a prominent feature in Japanese culture for centuries, nearly as popular as kitsune. It was hardly a surprise that one of these Japanese girls would want to become one, though they did want something more...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Naya, you look do cute,&quot; squealed Tani, freshly converted into a red panda.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look adorable too,&quot; squealed Naya, the first ringtail Animalian. It wasn&#39;t much of an exaggeration. While Animalians tended to lean more towards &#39;sexy&#39; than &#39;cute&#39;, their particular animals were definitely on the adorable side. There would be people looking at their cute faces just as often as they were looking at their sexy bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re totally going to be the cutest duo on Animalia&#39;s media site,&quot; said Tani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, the cutest trio,&quot; reminded Naya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right, what&#39;s taking Date so long?&quot; asked Tani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I do know that we&#39;re going to be the cutest girls around,&quot; said Naya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that may be a little subjective.&quot; The two turned to see Date. She looked pretty sexy in the bra and boxers she was currently wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Naya, &quot;You&#39;re plenty cute enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I may not be qualify as one of the girls,&quot; said Date, patting her hip. It was then that the other two noticed the rather big bulge in the front of Date&#39;s boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, did you stuff down there or did you...&quot; started Tani.<br />
<br />
Date smiled and said, &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t be much of a tanuki if I didn&#39;t have their legendary balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...wow...&quot; said Naya, &quot;I never would have guessed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did we not notice you were...&quot; Tani thought it over before saying, &quot;Actually, I don&#39;t think you showed any sign you were trans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I was...maybe...&quot; said Date, a little uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t go herm just because you&#39;re a tanuki, did you?&quot; asked Naya.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn&#39;t,&quot; said Date, &quot;I just...felt like a guy sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, were you gender-fluid?&quot; asked Tani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what it&#39;s called?&quot; asked Date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, whatever you were, you&#39;re a herm now,&quot; said Naya, &quot;You think you can handle it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How hard could it be?&quot; asked Date. Looking at hir friends, shi noticed how curvy and voluptuous they were now. Shi felt a tightness in hir groin as hir bulge became more noticeable. Date blushed under hir fur and said, &quot;This might take some getting used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know that the Raccoon Cuties are going to be the biggest hit on Animalia&#39;s media site,&quot; said Naya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, we&#39;re not actually raccoons,&quot; said Tani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right,&quot; said Naya before thinking it over, &quot;Does Quasi-Raccoon Cuties work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Works for me,&quot; said Date.</p>
