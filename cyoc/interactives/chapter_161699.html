<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carla, she was sedated and carted away to a certain physical doom, where her youth as an advantage and her pretty face would change; becoming average, looking like most of any common Santa-Gertrudis heifer.  <br />
<br />
Doctor Byle having heard the story of a girl raped by a Bull and a rare breed for north of Texas. He would make use of the semen to aid as direct the physical transition of a human female to become as a bovine animal. He felt sure that by the time young Carla became aware of her plight, she would awake and discover her body as partially reconfigured.<br />
<br />
The doctor as slightly mistaken in his assumption, as he sedated her, she was in a state of shock. As quite unexpected, on her first night in a T-cell, Carla awoke to find herself as inside a dark prison like cell, she strapped down to a cot, was lying there stripped of her clothing, she naked, having a cathode inserted into her for removal of urine, and a worse as more uncomfortable pipe stuffed into her anus.<br />
<br />
Naturally, Carla began to scream for help!<br />
<br />
Screams were a common sound coming from the T-cells, as if or when a subject awoke, what they soon discovered about their situation, was that they were partially, or mostly devoid of being a human.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, no help arrived, and Carla continued to lie there, scared, naked, and feeling used.<br />
<br />
Unknown, but outside the security fence a worried friend sat, she pondering at how she might enter the research facility, and retrieve her friend. Jen sat in her car, she with the thoughts and vivid memories of her friends, Carla and Jerry, they being as doomed. Her day and the cool of the night worked to ease her to fall asleep. As Jen slept until a gruff sounding man spoke to her, demanding she move along, as having parked there for most of the night.<br />
<br />
“Huh, who, me, oh I must have dozed off, long day yesterday!” Jennifer said, as she turned the key to start her car, a man standing guard inside the research facility compound yelled to the guard standing beside her car, to take her into custody.<br />
<br />
Before a sleepy eyed Jen could put her car in gear to drive away, the security guard had her car door open and had grabbed her left arm. Hauled out of her car, a stunned as horrified person was summarily hauled across the street, and then held by two guards, one Jennifer recognized as the man talking to the Ibex and the bull.<br />
<br />
“What, hey I have rights, you can’t arrest me,” Jen said, but to her surprise the one guard she somewhat knew, said to her, “Honey, after you were incarcerated, and entered past those gates, you became as property of this research facility!”<br />
<br />
“Why Bob, what did she do,” Asked the other guard, as his partner. As did the guard Bob smile, and looked at Jen, “Because she might well have heard me talking to Arnold and Justin, trying to keeping them quiet, Justin was bawling loudly.”<br />
<br />
“What, you had me take her into custody for what you said, as by mid-morning the two bull animals will get shipped out, and you would damn her to gain their cruel fate?” A rather kind and considerate guard asked of his partner.<br />
<br />
“Yes, for that, and for the weekly bonus paid for finding a trespasser, she was as good as thinking to gain entrance when and if she could; so that is reason enough. Let me take her upstairs and present her to one of the Professors or Doc Byle.” Said the guard named Bob, as Jen hearing the name Byle, she said, “No please not that quack!”<br />
<br />
“Ah-huh, enough admitted, she knows Doc Byle by name and his reputation!” As that said the guard Bob laughed as he took Jen by her right arm, and dragged her into a freight elevator.<br />
<br />
“Yea Honey, this is a stinking freight elevator, it is rarely used to take people like you inside the facility, but weeks later they ride it when delivered to a corral to await shipment. I get paid $500 for finding a nosy brat like you; a trespasser has worth, especially for me!” <br />
<br />
As the elevator rose from the basement floor, passing the second floor, Jen heard the scared voice of her friend Carla screaming for help.<br />
<br />
“Ah-huh, you know a voice, as that floor holds the T-cells, jail cells where those so medicated we take and put them inside to face how their bodies change, conforming to whatever animal the Professor has a need to produce for a buyer.<br />
<br />
Let us go have a look,” the guard said as he stopped the elevator, and lowered it to the second floor entrance.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go see your friend over there Honey!” The guard said as he shoved Jen toward a block of cells looking like real jail cells, no windows except a small port opening in each cell door.<br />
<br />
“HELP ME…,” Yelled the voice of Carla!<br />
<br />
The guard pushed Jennifer toward the first cell of six in a row. He shoved Jen to look in through the port window, to where inside the cell, huddled into a far corner sat what looked facially like a young teenage boy. As he heard Jen being body-slammed to look past his cell door, he stood up.<br />
<br />
“Hello, my name is William, or now as Doc Byle calls me as Billy. He makes fun of me, as see what he did to me!<br />
<br />
I Naa…, damn it, as whenever I, Naa…, speak and refer to myself as say I, Naa.., it makes me bleat like the goat I, Naa.., am becoming more each day I, Naa…, am here!” The half goat creature said, before he realized his visitor was a female. “A girl, female ah…, what I would delight to do to you if you entered my cell.” Billy said, as he shivered and Jen watched, seeing his red colored goat cock rising from his sheath. <br />
<br />
Jen was forced to watch, as she saw Billy, his facial expression turning as aggressive, and his cock beginning to spurt shots of pre-cum.<br />
<br />
“How about I unlock this door and shove you inside, as Billy there would molest, rape, and infect you with his virus. I wonder how you with a sleek figure like yours would look changing into becoming a doe goat.” The guard said, and he got out a key from off his belt, and unlocked the cell door.<br />
<br />
Just as the cell door was swung out into the hallway, the half goat boy stood to one side of the opened door. He was salivating, seemingly famished for want of having sex with a female. As the guard went to give Jen a shove to enter the cell, she stepped aside, and the goat boy reached at, as grabbed hold of the guard by his left arm, and summarily dragged him into the cell.<br />
<br />
Jen seeing her chance to escape a beastly fate she slammed the cell door shut. The cell door key was still in the lock and she gave it a quick twist, locking the guard inside with a spiteful feeling goat boy with a stout erection shoved then inside the struggling guard’s big mouth.<br />
<br />
Jen had a cell door key and taking her chance, she checked each port in each door until she found where Carla lay, she crying as to her fate.</p>
