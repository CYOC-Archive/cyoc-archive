<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even though some Animalian selections were available, they aren&#39;t exactly popular. Fish-based conversions are usually only sought by those who live near large bodies of water, namely the ocean. And even those that go through them tended to select more popular fish like sharks. Though with a new Animalian colony developing on the Californian coast, specifically on a section of Venice Beach, interest was starting to renew in aquatic Animalians. And considering Venice Beach&#39;s reputation for having weird people, it was expected for there to be some unusual requests.<br />
<br />
The deep-sea fish have been left untouched for a long time. But that was about to change as a group of goths from Venice Beach were wanting conversions. And they weren&#39;t wanting to be just any deep-sea fish, they wanted the ones that were naturally hermaphrodites, anglerfish and lizardfish. While not unacceptable, they had to be informed of the extra conditions that came with being physically bisexual. The only parts the goths complained about was having their piercings removed before the conversion and the fact that their tattoos would disappear.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel so naked without my nose ring,&quot; said Xanthe as he felt the space between his upper lip and his nostrils.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to have much of a nose afterwards,&quot; said Indigo who was looking at her inked arms wistfully, &quot;There better be a good tat artist in Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard there&#39;s one,&quot; said Dagger, &quot;I wonder if they do tattoos that glow in the dark. That&#39;d be awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t glow-in-the-dark stuff radioactive?&quot; asked Wyatt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a wet blanket,&quot; said Dagger.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re about to be fish. Wet blankets is probably a good thing for us,&quot; said Xanthe.<br />
<br />
Indigo grinned at Wyatt and said, &quot;Hey, you know how male anglers merge with females to become their gonads? You should go down on me while we&#39;re changing and see if you become my cock and balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...that doesn&#39;t work for Animalians, right?&quot; asked Wyatt, backing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;d be a lot less whiny if it worked,&quot; said Dagger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you don&#39;t want to switch girlfriends?&quot; asked Wyatt to Xanthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know she&#39;s joking,&quot; said Xanthe, &quot;Even if that were true, she&#39;d never let that happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eventually, the shots were delivered and the goths were led to a room where they could change together. It took a little coordination to make sure the right person got the right shot, but eventually they were left alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is starting to feel weird,&quot; said Xanthe, feeling a cold feeling go through his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s starting to look weird,&quot; said Indigo, watching the spot on her arm where she was injected. Fish scales were spreading out from that spot. Quite fittingly, they were indigo-colored. Unfortunately, she could also see her hard-earned tattoo collection being erased. She was going to start all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long before we start to change sexes?&quot; asked Wyatt as he watched his hand grow claws and webbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m looking forward to it,&quot; said Dagger. She removed her shoes to look at her new flippers. She could feel something building up in her spine as well.<br />
<br />
The changes had reached Xanthe&#39;s head now. His face was stretching out into something resembling a barracuda&#39;s snout as his teeth grew sharper. His longer silver-dyed hair parted as a dorsal fin started growing out, going from the back of his neck to his upper back like other herm fish. Speaking of which, the first signs of becoming herm were making themselves known as his shirt started pushing out. &quot;Dude, I&#39;m starting to grow tits,&quot; he said, his voice seeming to go up an octave.<br />
<br />
Indigo went over to the light switch and turned it off. The room didn&#39;t go into complete darkness, but it was quite dark. More than dark enough to see the light glowing from Indigo and Wyatt&#39;s escas. There was also a glow coming from Wyatt&#39;s going and Indigo&#39;s was starting to glow as well. She pulled down her pants, releasing a rod that grew longer as it was exposed to open air. Indigo stroke hir new rod and said, &quot;Looks like we don&#39;t need to fuse now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt licked his lips, feeling the sharper teeth. &quot;Could I still have a closer look at it?&quot; he asked, his voice getting higher as his breasts became more noticeable.<br />
<br />
&quot;First let&#39;s see if you&#39;re ready for me,&quot; said Indigo, hir voice getting more guttural. Wyatt offered no resistance as shi pulled off his clothes, revealing his larger breasts, the deep blue scales growing over his body, his relatively small tail, and his larger fish cock which now had a glowing head. Indigo squeezed Wyatt&#39;s ass, provoking moans from the still-changing angler fish until shi found a new dripping slit. &quot;I guess you are ready for me,&quot; said Indigo before removing what clothing shi had left before plunging hir dick into Wyatt&#39;s new slit.<br />
<br />
Dagger was appearing more like a fish as she peeled off her clothes. White scales had covered her body which contrasted with her hair. Unlike her friends, her hair was a bright gold, though she kept the sides of her head shaved. Her tail had grown out but was still getting longer. Her body was getting closer to the herm standard as her shoulders broadened and muscles grew larger. Her breasts were already much larger than they had been before. She was stroking between her legs, waiting for the next part to emerge. And soon enough it did, a piscine penis that lacked the glow of the angler fish&#39;s, but was quite functional. &quot;Ready to try my fishstick?&quot; Dagger asked Xanthe with a lusty growl.<br />
<br />
Xanthe removed the clothing from his feminizing body but gave Dagger a frown. &quot;That&#39;s the best you could come up with? That almost kills the mood,&quot; shi said as hir new slit opened up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares about what I say? Are we doing it or what?&quot; asked Dagger impatiently.<br />
<br />
Xanthe spread hir legs and said, &quot;We can work on your pillow talk later.&quot; Dagger crawled on top of hir before shi inserted hir new dick inside hir mate.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The biggest adjustment was making sure their scales didn&#39;t dry out. The four goths found it rather easy to accept their herm roles. Indigo seemed to be more dominant than Wyatt, who found shi liked being submissive. Xanthe and Dagger had a more equal partnership, though there was a bit of argument over which one would be laying eggs first.<br />
<br />
Though one thing they had overlooked in studying their new instincts was their feeding habits. That usually wasn&#39;t a problem with average meals. But when presented with a buffet like at the Thanksgiving dinner, they lost control of themselves and gorged until their elastic stomachs had swollen out. And thanks to deep-sea fish&#39;s digestives being designed to make sure very little went to waste, they were going to have to work off those extra pounds, which ought to keep them busy for most of winter.</p>
