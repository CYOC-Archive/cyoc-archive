<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The increasingly monstrous freaks moaned as the last of their cum squirted into the bloated emo cockslut that Chris had become. Dominic found himself mewling into Jeff&#39;s mouth as they savagely kissed, the smaller of the two musclegods finishing minutes before the largest man on the planet was even close to finishing his god-like orgasm. When Jeff finally stopped, his hungry, sex-starved cock still pulsed inside his brother&#39;s stretched out ass. The two giants parted their lips and drank in the sight of the other.<br />
<br />
Dominic raised his arms and flexed, cooing to himself as he basked in his own gargantuan grandeur. Thanks to Jeff&#39;s tampering with the Chronivac, the beastly college wrestler swelled to simply massive proportions as he fucked Chris&#39; ass, and even more when he came in it. As Dominic licked his giant bicep, groaning as he pumped more and more blood into it, forcing the peak into the palm of his hand, he wondered which side of a ton he landed on; he really hoped he weighed more. He looked down at his best friend and smirked. Besides the giant, bloated belly, Chris was so tiny now and Dom guessed he had to be at least 8 feet tall. The giant shuddered and lowered his arms, pressing them together. He sighed lustily as his hairy chest pushed up against his chin, his neck disappearing vertically, but billowing out into traps that threatened to swallow up his ears. The massive beast could no longer see them, but he felt up his giant, densely-haired abs. There was so much muscle there, they had no place to go but out, his physique carved, yet bowled out into a thick, hairy musclegut.<br />
<br />
As Dominic reveled in his new size, Jeff did the same. Pulling out of his brother&#39;s anus and standing up, he realized Dom only came up to his collarbone. The immensely muscled 16-year-old musclegod smirked and rolled his shoulders, purring as his rough hands roamed across muscular perfection. He grabbed at Dominic&#39;s hand and made the older, lesser, musclegod feel his hairy abs, his giant glutes, his tree-thick thighs.<br />
<br />
The two giants were leaking copious amounts of pre, moaning and groaning as they felt each other and themselves up. The fluids dripped onto Chris&#39; abused, swollen twink body, the little size queen whining as he reflexively opened his mouth to drink in as much pre-jizz as his sluttly mouth could get a hold of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I gotta test this body out,&quot; Jeff mused, smiling devilishly as Dominic played with his chest, mesmerized by the sheer size and expanse of the twin muscled mountains. Jeff squeezed his pecs, trapping Dom&#39;s hand between the slabs of beef.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urmf, then let&#39;s hit the gym, kid,&quot; Dominic huffed, his eyes meeting the even bigger man&#39;s. The two of them saunter out of Chris&#39; room, their humongous thighs swinging around each other as they were forced into an exaggerated bodybuilder&#39;s swagger from the sheer volume of meat on their bones.<br />
<br />
Chris wanted to join them, but his body was so weak, unable to move around with the mass of how much cum he was forced to ingest. He watched futilely as Jeff and Dominic waddled past his room, now dressed in skin-tight clothes that &#39;fit&#39; the Jeff that was &#39;merely&#39; 1200 pounds. Their stringer shirts couldn&#39;t even cover their chests, looking almost like bras. The shorts they wore looked like Speedos, not even able to cover their baskets, mounds of vein-covered dickmeat on display, the impressions of their cockheads clearly visible through the nearly transparent fabric. As the beasts boomed down the stairs, Chris clawed his way forward, barely making any progress. He had to get to the Chronivac...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jeff should&#39;ve known that playing with the Chronivac so much would have had dire consequences for reality. As he and Dom piled into the college wrestler&#39;s pick up, it should&#39;ve been the first sign that something was up. For some reason, they fit inside the truck. Not perfectly, but they still fit. As they drove to the gym, Jeff noticed that the houses were bigger, much bigger. A regular house shouldn&#39;t tower over a century old tree, but they all did. Dominic was getting a little uneasy as well. He noticed that as he drove, the lanes seemed a lot wider and as they rolled into the parking lot, the parking spaces were spaced well apart, almost twice the width of the vehicle. And it needed every inch of that space, Jeff and Dominic&#39;s huge, meat-filled crotches pressed against the sides of the adjacent cars as they squeezed out of the truck.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the two of them made it inside that things really began to hit home that this wasn&#39;t Kansa- erm, this wasn&#39;t the reality they were used to anymore. Everywhere they looked, there were massive muscle monsters strutting around the place, their pumped muscles straining at their clothes, if they opted to wear them at all. And that statement included shorts and underwear!<br />
<br />
Dominic&#39;s jaw dropped as he stared at someone he knew from college walked passed him, casually waving. It was the football team&#39;s backup kicker, the damn backup, and he was huge! A linebacker, he could see having a build this guy&#39;s build, but he had never seen a kicker that needed to be over 600 pounds of muscles of bearish beef!<br />
<br />
Jeff was equally mortified by what he saw. All those alterations on the Chronivac had seriously screwed up reality. He saw guys openly fucking one another on the bench press, worship sessions going on by the dumbbells. His gaze was fixed on a huge, hairy stud that seemed familiar. He looked young, almost like him. He was bent over a bench and his ass was being slammed by a much hairier, older gent; a huge muscledaddy and his cub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey everyone,&quot; the guy he was staring at boomed, wincing and smiling all the while as his ass was being pounded, &quot;Jeff and Dom are here!&quot; There were whoops in reply. For as large as all the men in the gym had become, Jeff and Dominic were leagues ahead of them, their bodies over a ton to these lesser gods, none weighing less than 500 pounds.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as he felt hands coming up to feel him from behind. Murmurs and soft groans surrounding him and Dominic. &#39;Did he get bigger?&#39; &#39;Holy, Dom, ya look more hung than last time!&#39; Jeff looked to his side to see Dominic surrounded by giant, muscled men, their cocks rubbing against Dominic&#39;s hugeness. Jeff felt the same, searing hot flesh pressing against him as we was being worshiped dutifully by the smaller musclemen. He felt himself chub up and greedy hands instantly grasped at his steely, pink flesh, eager to please the largest of them all. The huge teen raised his hands and let out a deep roar of approval, feeling tongues lick at his hairy pits, his musk washing over the lesser men. He smiled as Dominic did the same, the two gods among men growing delirious as they were pleasured and worshiped the way they ought to.</p>
