<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing as I had one more day, I decided to wait on making a decision.  To pass the time before breakfast, I went downstairs to see play video games on our Wii U.  When I came down, it seemed that no one was up yet, so I went to the TV to turn on the Wii U.  Upon looking at our game selections, it seemed that our games were limited to mostly rated E, the only rated T game I could see was Super Smash Bros.  Understandable, considering I made myself 8 with reality to match so I could not really complain.  I settled on Mario Kart 8 and sat on the couch to play.  On sitting down I noticed that with my shorter frame my feet no longer touched the floor, I am not sure I could get used to everything being so big compared to before.  Oh well, so I played for for about an hour before I heard both Mom and Megan come down.  I paused the game to see them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Mom, morning Megan.&quot;  I greeted.  Mom then pulled me into a hug.  &quot;Good morning Jeff,&quot; She greeted, &quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;  Megan was giggling at my predicament.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; I replied, embarrassed.  &quot;Is this going to be a reoccurring thing with you?&quot; I asked, having to crane my head up just to look her in the eye.  &quot;Well,&quot; she began playfully while still hugging me, &quot;It is not exactly everyday that you could make yourself younger.  I might as well savor every moment that I have my little boy back, especially since it will only be temporary.&quot;  She finished.  &quot;Erm, that&#39;s nice, but weren&#39;t you going to make us breakfast?&quot; I asked, still embarrassed.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I did not hate the hug.  It felt very warm and comforting in my mom&#39;s arms when I am this small, however it was still embarrassing and she could not hold me forever.  &quot;Fine,&quot; she sighed, reluctantly letting me go so she could prepare breakfast.  Normally I would be helping her make it but at the moment I was too small.  I then turned to my sister, who then stared giggling again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha,&quot;  I said dryly, &quot;Laugh it up Megan.&quot;  &quot;What?&quot;  She began, &quot;It is not every day I get to be the big sister to a now cute younger brother, I&#39;m tempted to hug you myself.&quot;  &quot;Erm, that won&#39;t be necessary.&quot; I said, embarrassed, causing my sister to pout.  &quot;Humph fine, be that way, no hugs for you.&quot;  She said, turning away from me with her arms crossed, though I could tell she was only playing.  Megan then looked over to the TV,  &quot;Oh, Mario Kart, wanna play two player?&quot;  She said excitedly.  &quot;Heh, why not?&quot;  I replied, and we set the game up for two player mode.  Once again, I found myself having fun playing with my sister.  I won some races, she won some others, it did not matter much to me, I was just having fun.  After an hour of playing, mom called us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, Megan, breakfast.&quot;  She called.  &quot;Coming,&quot; Megan and I both said.  Breakfast consisted of eggs, bacon, hash-browns, pancakes, and orange juice.  Though I could only eat it all in smaller portions, which is why Mom did not make as much as she normally did.  After a satisfying breakfast, Mom had something to announce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, Megan,&quot; She began.  &quot;Sometime today we will need to go grocery shopping, so before that, why don&#39;t we go out to lunch as well?&quot;  Megan and I both perked up at that.  I now wondered what it would be like to go out while I was younger.  &quot;Sure/no problem,&quot; Megan and I both replied respectively.  &quot;I thought you two would say that, okay then be ready to go by 12:00.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
At 12:00, we went out to the car to go to lunch.  Despite being younger than I normally was, luckily I was still tall enough not to need a car seat (which would have been embarrassing for me).  I almost opened the front passenger door, but then remembered that at my current size it would be too risky for me to sit in front, so I settled for the back seat with Megan.  Mom then drove us to McDonald&#39;s and we went inside, this one happened to have an indoor playscape.  Mom them went up to order for us, because of my smaller size I settled for a junior cheeseburger with small fries and drink, I didn&#39;t need the kid&#39;s meal.  While we were waiting, I looked over at the playscape.  It has been years since I have been on one those, how nostalgic; however now that I was a little kid again I had to admit, it was very temping to try it again.  I looked over to Mom and is seemed that she had already noticed me eyeing the playscape and had an amused expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on ahead,&quot; she sighed, &quot;I will call you when the food is ready.&quot;  She finished, and that&#39;s when I gave in to the temptation.  I then made my way to the playscape.  &quot;Make sure to be safe though.&quot;  She added.  &quot;I will Mom,&quot; I replied.  I went in to the playscape room and I noticed my sister followed me in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am here to watch you.&quot;  I just shrugged and took of my shoes an started climbing up.  I had to admit, it was rather fun and nostalgic to play on the playscape again.  I was enjoying myself quite a bit climbing up and sliding back down again now that I was the right age and size to do so.  After several minutes of playing, mom called us when the food was ready.  After enjoying my cheeseburger and fries, I played in the playscape some for for 10 more minutes then we left to get groceries.  At the store, everyone except for kids of  around my current age or less now looked so big to me.  Also with my now short legs, I could not walk as fast as I could.  While we were getting groceries, we ran into one of my mom&#39;s friends and they did some talking.  I noticed that my mom&#39;s friend did not seem to notice that I was actually only half the age I normally was, at least the Chronivac was working like it should.  While they were talking, my mom&#39;s friend made a comment on how well behaved I was in the store to which my mom remarked,<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Jeff may be only 8 but yet he already has the maturity of a boy twice his age.&quot;  Megan and I could not help but giggle at the irony.  We then took our items for checkout and went back home.  A couple of hours later we had dinner.  After dinner, since we all had some downtime we decided to watch a movie.  We all decided on Zootopia since we have recently got it on bluray.  We have not seen it yet but we heard it was very good.  It may be somewhat of a kids movie, but hey for now I am a kid.  The movie was a good as we heard and we all enjoyed it.  After it was over Mom looked at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, its after 8pm already?&quot;  She said.  &quot;Alright you two, you should both wash up, i expect you both to be in bed by 9.&quot;  &quot;Yes Mom,&quot; Megan and I both said.  We went upstairs; I got my pajamas and went into the bathroom to wash.  Afterward I went to my room.  It was around 8:30pm when I went to the Chronivac again to make my decision. Should I just grow back up tomorrow evening?  Should I stay 8 until the next Sunday?  Or should I just make this permanent and start over at 8 and grow back up the natural way? Decisions decisions.</p>
