<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Allison was expecting to feel the demonic wolf's fangs tear her apart but was surprised when she felt it's nose sniff her crotch. Her surprise grew as she felt it's tongue licking her crotch. It sent waves of pleasure through her entire body making her shudder.<br />
<br />
Her dad said &quot;This pleasure is pale in comparison to what you'll experience if the great Zamdarr picks us as his mate. Why fight and be in pain when pleasure is so much better?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was considering just giving in. The pleasure was almost overwhelming and she looked forward to the pleasure Zamdarr could bring her. It would be so easy to just give in.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right sweetie&quot; her mom said. &quot;It's so much easier and much less painful when you just give in to the pleasure. You can help spread this pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was tempted. She knew that her parents had let go of her and were standing back. She thought about all those she could help to experience this pleasure. Aunt Charlene would like this as would Uncle Andrew. Jen would too but at that thought she realized that she wasn't old enough to experience this pleasure. At seven Jen hadn't even started puberty yet.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes in time to see the wolf rear up with it's mouth open. She quickly dodged to the side and said &quot;I won't join the pack&quot; before running into the forest.<br />
<br />
She kept running for days resting every so often. After about five days she came across an old two story house. It was rather dilapidated but it looked sturdy enough. It would provide her with some shelter at least. She was tired of running through the woods nude. She might even find some clothes inside.<br />
<br />
The door creaked as she opened it. Peering inside she could tell that it was dusty and there was a musty smell. It was slightly warmer inside though and she went in. Looking around she found a chest that held nothing but scraps of paper and some wire. In the kitchen she found a rusty spoon but that was it. There was nothing downstairs so she headed upstairs. As she did the stairs creaked and she was afraid that she would fall through.<br />
<br />
Upstairs in one of the bedrooms she found a sword. This sword seemed out of place as it wasn't rusted or broken. It looked like it was brand new. It was hanging on one wall by a magnetic mount. On closer inspection she realized that it was the same type of sword she had when she was a guy. She had ordered some swords from a catalog and when she had been transformed her parents had allowed her to have them in her room. She hadn't been able to bring them to England of course. She lifted the sword from it's mount and even though it was heavy she could wield it.<br />
<br />
Her parents came through the door her mom saying &quot;Come with us honey. It's not too late to join the pack. Listen to us. We know what's best for you. We are your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not my parents&quot; she said raising the sword. She had figured that bit out during the past five days. &quot;You're part of the demonic wolf taking the form of my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not true princess&quot; her dad said. &quot;No put that sword down before you hurt yourself or someone else. You don't know how dangerous it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know how dangerous it is&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;My parents knew that I know. They also knew that I could handle myself around swords which is why they let me keep them after my transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the image of her parents lunged at her. She dodged and slashed at the image of her mom. It connected with her partially severed head and finished the job. There was a sickening scream and the image dissolved into a puddle of black bubbling goo.<br />
<br />
The image of her dad was still there and he lunged at her again. She brought the sword up and he impaled himself on it. The same thing happened to the image of her dad as happened with the image of her mom. Suddenly she was knocked down from behind causing her to lose her grip on the sword which clattered just out of her reach.<br />
<br />
She knew that the wolf was on her back as she could hear it snarl at her. She desperately tried to reach the sword to defend herself. She stretched as far as she could and by some miraculous chance her fingers touched the hilt. It was enough that she was able to pull it closer to where she could get a good grip. Instinctively she jabbed behind her head and she heard an unholy howl of pain. She was able to turn her head around enough to see that the blade had gone through the wolf's mouth into it's brain.<br />
<br />
The wolf was shaking violently and she said &quot;Go to Hell where you belong.&quot; She gave the sword a little twist and the wolf let out another unholy howl. It then dissolved into the same black goo that the image of her parents had. It was disgusting to feel as it covered her back but it quickly disappeared. Quite suddenly the house changed. She now recognized her room at her parents' house that she stayed in for the short time she lived with them again after her transformation.<br />
<br />
A sound in the doorway made her look and she saw her parents there. This time they looked like they had when she last saw them. Her mom smiled and said &quot;We're so proud of you honey. You beat the demon and are free of it now. We have a message for you. There is one more girl or boy that Jen has to transform into a magical girl to complete her group. Help her find that girl or boy before they become a victim of Zamdarr. Also tell your Aunt that we are awaiting the day when she will join us. We don't know when that day will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything went dark at this moment.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Allison woke up to find Father Winston by her bedside. She told him that the demon was gone and she was free. She was surprised when he told her that she had been out for only an hour.<br />
<br />
Over the next month they kept an eye on the news. The police as a whole had finally gotten brave enough to go out at night and as reports of the wolves grew a strict curfew enforced. It was only a matter of time before the wolves were at the door. They kept busy preparing for that eventuality by setting up various defenses.<br />
<br />
People kept coming to the school to seek refuge having heard rumors of an angel that would protect them. They of course were disappointed that there wasn't an angel but they stayed none the less. Allison even met a few Atheists that came in.<br />
<br />
As the wolves continued to gain ground news of several of the children's families having been turned came in. Father Winston and Allison formed a group to comfort those children in their time of need. It helped that Allison and Father Winston had been able to beat their demons. Father Winston beat his a week after Allison while she watched over him when he fell into unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
One of the girls that Allison was helping was six year old Elizabeth. Her parents had insisted that she attend a religious school and so sent her here. The day after Father Winston beat his demon Elizabeth's parents were converted though they didn't find out until two days later. Since then Elizabeth refused to leave Allison's side. Allison had to go to her classes with her so she would go and not be in hysterics. They formed such a deep bond of friendship that Allison wondered if Elizabeth might be the magical girl her parents had said to help find. Of course she also had the same deep level of friendship with Father Winston so maybe he was the one. They would just have to see.</p>
