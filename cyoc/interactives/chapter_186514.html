<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two of you sat comfortably on the edge of Luna&#39;s bed, and now that you&#39;d moved in with the Vaxer family as a result of getting Luna pregnant on your path to becoming a MILF-wolf it would probably be a bed that the two of you would share. However, your thoughts were more focused on Luna and her comfort. You hadn&#39;t expected her to be that upset over Kellie and Roxie going out to get in contract other MILF-wolves and any regular werewolves they could find that a group of known killers were thought to be either coming to town or were already in town, but in a way it was understandable. Luna had always seemed close to her mom, and you supposed in private with Roxie, and the fact that they could be targeted by a bunch of racists that the Wolf Hunters were would mean a very personal loss if something went wrong.<br />
<br />
The closest you could equate to that was the death of your biological mother, but that had been due to things that no one could control. It had hurt you and your father, and until he met your stepmom drove some of his more &quot;reactionary&quot; opinions, but it was still something that was natural. The threat that the Wolf Hunters posed was different. You had only paid loose attention to the news on them, as they weren&#39;t necessarily a massed army that could overpower the police or anything like that, but that didn&#39;t remove the fact that they were known to be violent, hated werewolves of all kinds, and were now coming to the town you lived in, or might already be in town. The violence that came with them was scary, even with what limited knowledge you had on them, and Luna might actually have more knowledge about those things.<br />
<br />
After all, based on what you&#39;d learned tonight, that Luna&#39;s mother, Kellie, was the first MILF-wolf and became one while pregnant with Luna, that had meant that Luna was going to eventually become the MILF-wolf she was now from the moment she was born. Luna just had to wait until old enough for those &quot;genes&quot; to kick into action. That would mean that she and her family likely paid more attention to these sorts of things than your family did, as groups like the Wolf Hunters would be a threat to them. Thus by knowing more, Luna could probably go into greater detail on the sort of actions that the Wolf Hunters took and had more reason to be afraid, something you didn&#39;t have to worry about until becoming a MILF-wolf. That had you focused on doing all that you could to try and comfort Luna, as the two of you had been close friends for years. The fact that both of you had secretly considered the other as a romantic partner, but had never been able to say it out loud was just another of the surprises from the night, and thankfully one of the good ones. It let you be open on how you felt about her, and you held her to you to try and show that, occasionally licking at the sides of Luna&#39;s muzzle as you tried to figure out something that would make her feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Luna said to you after about ten minutes of sitting there in a warm and loving, though non-sexual embrace, &quot;thank you for being you... the same as you were as Nick... my friend. The only one that I could say I&#39;ve had interest in from the other boys at school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; you said back to her, &quot;you&#39;ve been my best friend for years... accepted me for me, transgender... foot fetish... and all the other things that most would look down on me for. Even without the love for you there... I&#39;d do my best to make you feel better because we&#39;re friends. Learning you loved me too... that was just an extra for tonight and something that would only make me want to help you more... and... and... I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going with this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... tonight had its fair share of surprises, and while some weren&#39;t bad, it wasn&#39;t quite how I imagined by first night in my MILF-wolf form would go,&quot; Luna said weakly, &quot;I&#39;d imagined it all out that I&#39;d transform and would then be able to contact you, we&#39;d sit and talk... I&#39;d be able to say how I love you and we could then become the couple we are now. Me carrying your baby and you feeling confident in the right gender. From there, we&#39;d then integrate into the rest of the pack and all the ceremonies that go with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom and Roxie told you a lot about those things, I take it?&quot; you asked as Luna nuzzled her head and muzzle into your shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I was always going to grow into this,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;so it&#39;d make sense that I&#39;d be aware of things that would relate to being a MILF-wolf. As it wouldn&#39;t work well to end up with the wrong person... or if I get overwhelmed by things.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and rubbed Luna&#39;s far shoulder with one hand. Through the pads underneath your fingers, you could feel the softness of Luna&#39;s blonde fur and you hoped she like the feel of your brown fur. It was something that if the overhanging tension caused by the warning that the Wolf Hunters were on their way, if not already in town, would have been something that you would have wanted to escalate to another round of sex with Luna, but they were in town. That presence and that tension was enough seriously worry Luna about the health and safety of her parents as they left the house, and trying to seduce her didn&#39;t seem right to you at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; you said to Luna and nuzzled your muzzle to hers, &quot;and I&#39;m sure your parents will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Luna said weakly, &quot;but all the stories that have been out there on the Wolf Hunters. For as small as their group is... only like 2,000 people nation-wide, they&#39;re violent and ruthless. There&#39;s one report that gives an indication that they killed a normal human a few years ago on the assumption that the person was a werewolf. The guy was just walking home and a member drove up, fired a round though his skull and left a cardboard note reading &quot;were&quot; and then drove away. And that was with a guy who WASN&#39;T a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... they are scary,&quot; you agreed, &quot;but they aren&#39;t perfect, either. I&#39;m sure your parents will be able to pay attention and note the presence of anyone strange and avoid trouble. I&#39;d think for right now you just need to focus on something else. All we can do is wait for your parents to come back. For I wouldn&#39;t be of much help. I&#39;m still getting used to the better hearing, sense of smell, balancing with these big breasts I&#39;ve grown and all the other things that any man that&#39;s ever become a MILF-wolf has had to go through.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got Luna to give a small chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it pretty quickly,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;Mom said that dad adjusted to being a busty middle aged women in a matter of days with regard to things like balance and staying covered and so on. You&#39;ll be fine there.&quot;<br />
<br />
You returned the chuckle and accepted the complement that you&#39;d be able to adjust to things quickly. You took that as something to reinforce the decision to come to the Vaxer home earlier in the evening. Some of it made sense, given that you&#39;d seen becoming a MILF-wolf as the means to be in the right gender, but you did like the encouragement from Luna. Particularly at a moment where she was rather nervous about things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though right now... with everything going on, while I wouldn&#39;t mind some things more pleasurable, that probably isn&#39;t appropriate,&quot; Luna said slowly, &quot;so... if we do something, it&#39;d need to be something we can pause quickly if and when mom and &quot;dad&quot; get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and nuzzled Luna&#39;s muzzle again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I was thinking we get your PlayStation hooked up and we can play through one the game&#39;s story-mode while we wait,&quot; Luna offered, &quot;that way when they get home we can pause and even save progress in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like fun,&quot; you replied with a smile as you stood up, &quot;and we can keep an eye out too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you got up and then proceeded to make your way out and head down the stairs that lead to the living room. In the past it had amazed you at how the Vaxers had as big of a house as they did with two stories, particularly when Luna was an only child. For a time, your thought that Roxie was Kellie&#39;s sister might have allowed for it, but now, as a MILF-wolf and knowing that Roxie was actually Luna&#39;s father transformed into a MILF-wolf that raised some private wonder at that. It was something that marked on how successful Kellie and Roxie had been. It was success on that side and was something that you were amazed by. You could only hope that you and Luna would manage to do as well going forward, but a lot of that would be more long term.<br />
<br />
You both arrived back in the living room and began setting the PlayStation so that the two of you could start one of the games. It took a little rearranging on some things to make sure the console was properly plugged into the television and then plugged into the power strip that it had initially been placed near. While you did this, Luna moved to close the front blinds, the blinds you had initially looked through to see Kellie in her MILF-wolf form trying to accelerate Luna&#39;s transformations at the start of the evening. Now, both of you were fully transformed MILF-wolves and looking to play one of the games for the PlayStation you owned. As you finished putting things together for the power and TV cords you then passed the controllers over to Luna as she sat down on the couch. She took them and you then looked to the stack of games that were on the floor next to where the gaming system had been. You didn&#39;t own too many games and most fit within a fairly select genre of fantasy and even role playing games. They were fun and often allowed the player to have customized characters, which you liked, as you could often play them with a female character.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what game would you want to play?&quot; you asked to Luna while she leaned over to a small square table that was next to the couch to turn the television on.<br />
<br />
&quot;How Zoria?&quot; Luna asked referring to a sort of level game in which a princess and her sister battled a dragon that frequently kidnapped their gardeners, &quot;the campaign isn&#39;t hard and the save system is quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and then collected the game from the stack turned on the PlayStation and placed the disc in. From there you then moved to sit next to Luna where she then handed you the controller. You found the controller smaller than you remembered, and it took a few moments to remember that in your present wolven form you were actually much bigger than you had been as Nick. It&#39;s where as the MILF-wolf Nicki, you had grown tremendously and this was something came as both surprising and pleasing in a way. You hadn&#39;t lost too much dexterousness in your transformation and it was more that you had to restrain your strength, and Luna had to do the same as well. It isn&#39;t long before the pair of you are playing of the games and even having some fun. You occasionally looked over to check on Luna and she looked a bit happier as the two of you played the game. Though your ears were also on the alert while waiting for Kellie and Roxie to come home from their warning mission.</p>
