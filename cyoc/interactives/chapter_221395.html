<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle paced. His cock slammed into his shins with every step, his now monstrous balls bouncing off of his thighs. His cock was wider than his leg, and his balls each almost the size of volleyballs. They pulled heavily on his crotch with every swing, threatening to throw him off balance. He raced through his contact list, trying to find anyone he would consider a friend. Being almost untouchable because of his dickish behavior, this was difficult, but he did eventually find his friend Jarred&#39;s number. He dialed it.<br />
<br />
Jarred picked up, groggy from another late night of gaming. Kyle quickly rattled off everything he could about the curse and his predicament, sounding to Jarred like he&#39;d lost his mind. After begging him to answer dare, Kyle asked, &quot;Transform, or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...dare,&quot; Jarred responded. The pause unsettled Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;PLEASE change my curse to make it better!&quot; he squealed, almost crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;re saying you&#39;re unhappy with that monster of a cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle froze. He had forgotten something important. Jarred had a hyper fetish, and even worse for him, was a furry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Jarred, I can barely wear pants!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So? You have the biggest cock on Earth, how could you even be unhappy? It&#39;s gotta weigh what, 40 pounds?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If not more,&quot; Kyle groaned. &quot;But that&#39;s- that&#39;s not the point! Please change it, make it stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare?&quot; There was jealous venom in Jarred&#39;s voice. Kyle gulped, but his eagerness to be rid of his third leg overtook him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Kyle, I get you&#39;re unhappy with it, but I just can&#39;t imagine why. That&#39;s my dream, y&#39;know? It&#39;s hot as fuck. Everyone would kill for a cock like yours. So, I&#39;ll change your curse alright. Since you aren&#39;t grateful to Jen for giving you such a massive gift, maybe you&#39;ll thank me for turning you into my dream guy. For your transformation, your cock will change into a horse&#39;s, sheath and fur and all. Your balls too, gallon upon heavy gallon of equine cum filling them to bursting. Instead of an inch per hour like Jen said, you&#39;ll grow three, and it&#39;ll be retroactive. To top it off, you&#39;ll also keep growing for an extra day. You&#39;ll be able to go nude from the waist down, but I can&#39;t guarantee no one will think it&#39;s weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle could hardly believe what was being told to him, but then he suddenly remembered. Jarred was also gay, and into feminine men. His thoughts raced as Jarred completed the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll also gain muscle on your legs, so you can still walk. And plenty of insulation to keep it padded. Plus, a cute horse tail above your ass and hooves instead of feet. There. Hope you&#39;re happy now.&quot; Click<br />
<br />
Kyle fought back tears as he screamed in rage and despair. He could hardly believe his own foolishness, at asking Jarred of all people to fix his curse. His crotch burned as it changed in front of his eyes, his human dick flattening at the tip. It turned a mottled pink and black as a fuzzy black sheath grew around the base. It pulled his cock up his abdomen as it grew in, stopping nearly at his nipples. From there his equine dick sprouted forth. And sprout it did. He could hardly believe it as the previous day&#39;s inches grew in. Already 24 inches long, he feared how big he&#39;d end up.<br />
<br />
Inch on inch grew onto his already monstrous dick until it pushed against his chin, then his face, finally drooping forward from his chest as its weight sagged. 24 inches. 36. 48. Foot upon foot of cock grew as its sheath overtook his torso. 60 inches. With a final spurt and a bit of pre-cum dribbling out, it reached 72 inches. It was thicker than his waist, and its weight was unbelievable. His balls rested against the floor, spreading out like beanbags in front of his feet. His cock threatened to pull him to the ground, the strain on his sheath almost painful if it weren&#39;t so pleasurable. His legs started to shake and buckle under the new weight, until suddenly they heated up.<br />
<br />
First, a slight pain at the base of his spine. He felt something push out, and soon felt a hairy new appendage swing against his legs and sack. His tail. He felt his feet morph, his middle toe pushing out as his posture adjusted. The nail expanded around the tip as he grew slightly taller, standing now on the tip of his toe instead of his foot. His new feet gave his back an exaggerated arch, poking his ass out behind him. <i>My hooves...</i> He then watched in silent fear as his thighs and calves bulged. His hips cracked, widening to make room for his couch-filling balls. His thighs ballooned out, eclipsing 40 inches in diameter as quickly as he could eyeball them. His ass bulged out behind him, creating a shelf of unbelievable strength. His legs and ass continued to heat up as the &quot;insulation&quot; grew in. Soon each thigh was almost 60 inches around, and his hips growing past 100. Pound upon pound of soft fat grew in on his legs, the muscle underneath growing to compensate. Eventually, to Kyle&#39;s horror and relief, it was over.<br />
<br />
Kyle waddled over to the mirror to take in the damage. Each slow, labored step caused his thighs and ass to jiggle like crazy, while his huge equine cock bobbed up and down farther ahead than he could reach. His ass pulled down heavily on his skin, stretched beyond belief. His balls shuffled on the ground, the feeling of them dragging on the carpet threatening to harden his already massive cock. It was incredibly difficult to keep balanced on his spindly new hooves, and he almost fell over twice. He gasped as he looked in the mirror. The bottom half of his vision was filled by his balls and the arched top of his cock. Veins bulged the size of his wrist, and he was completely soft. His ass and thighs didn&#39;t even fit in the &quot;full-body&quot; mirror, each thigh nearing 70 inches around, competing for room on his minuscule human torso with each other and his crotch.<br />
<br />
He looked over his shoulder and wanted to sob. His ass stuck out almost 3 feet behind him, and his hips began to jut out well above his navel. As if to taunt him, he watched as his tail instinctively swished. It only managed to tickle his ass, before settling back in the center atop a lump of fat, the very tip of it only barely managing to reach his crack.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t hold his arms flat against his torso anymore, only managing a nearly 70 degree angle before they started to press into his hips. He pressed as hard as he could, amazed by how far into himself he could push, pound upon pound of soft fat hanging off of his otherwise skinny frame. He slammed his fists into his hips in anger, which both hurt and gave him a staggering amount of pleasure. They seemed to jiggle and ripple for a concerningly long time. <i>Did the curse make my skin more sensitive?</i> he wondered, massaging his now sore hips. He looked back up in the mirror, still in disbelief. His hips were nearly 120 inches around, compared to his tiny, almost feminine 26-inch waist. Well, what used to be his waist, now dominated by excess hip fat thrust up by his massive glutes. Turning around, he felt his body jiggle in foreign ways. Entirely new parts of him brushed against other entirely new parts, an overwhelming deluge of foreign sensations. As he looked at the back of his ass, he groaned.<br />
<br />
A perfectly placed outgrowth of fat rendered it impossible for him to reach his ass crack. Even his nearly 3-foot-long tail could barely reach it. He leaned back as far as he could, only making it 2/3rds of the way around his cheek. He blushed, embarrassed, only to then grow horrified as another familiar sensation quickly overcame his entire lower body. <i>Not just my crotch anymore...</i> he thought, pale.<br />
<br />
His cock lurched forward another 3 inches in length, drooping slightly more. His balls also spread out a little more too, and he swore he could see a ripple of fat and muscle go over his legs. He absolutely dreaded what the next 2 days had in store for him.</p>
