<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s father looked at the program and was amazed by what it can do.  So far, he already saw his son’s hair change from brown to blonde and he was already impressed.  So he wondered about what else this Chronivac can do.  Just then a thought occurred to him that could work.  Throughout the years, Jeff has always been lonely in the family.  Though he had friends in school, he never had a bond with his siblings.  This older brother spends less time with him since he’s more focused on sports.  And though he has a younger sister, her only interest is to play with her dolls.  Not to mention that he was busy with work all the time and has very little time for his son.  But maybe with the Chronivac his son has, he could make a change of that.  Perhaps he could change himself into a younger brother Jeff will play with so that he would never be lonely.  Plus he just got off of work early and now has plenty of free time on his hands.  So maybe this is a good enough opportunity to bond with his son in a completely different way.<br />
<br />
Looking to his son, he asked him, “Hey son.  Can I ask you something?”  Jeff looked to his dad and wondered what he wants.  “Yeah dad what is it?” he asked.  “I know things have been hectic for you,” he said, “being that you never bond well with your siblings in the house.  And I know that you want to bond with them so badly, only they can’t connect with you.  So here’s the proposal.  Why don’t I bond with you, but not as a father.  I’m thinking more along the line as a younger brother.”  Jeff listened to that and was surprised by the sudden news.  “Really dad?” he asked a little shock, “You really want to become a younger brother?  Sounds a little unexpected.  Shouldn’t you worry about your job?”  Jeff’s father looked at him happily and responded, “Don’t worry about it Jeff, I got off early today.  I think now would be a good opportunity to bond with you   Don’t worry; it’s only for today.  Just enough for us enjoy our fun together.  By the end of the day, you will revert me back to normal so that no one will notice that I’m gone.  Deal?”<br />
<br />
Jeff listened to him and was a little hesitant.  Indeed he never had much of a bond between himself and his siblings.  So to let his father take over as the younger sibling, that seems out of place.  But he needed someone to play with at home and with everyone busy doing their own thing, it’s never really easy.  Perhaps his father was right and maybe it could help him bond with him really well.  After all, he now as the Chronivac to change both him and his dad to whatever they want.  So shrugging his shoulders, he said, “All right pops.  If that’s what you wanted, then let’s do it.”  Jeff’s father smiled warmly and was glad that his son made his decision.  But before they could bond, Jeff needs to start making the changes.<br />
<br />
Jeff started by looking through the menu and found the option for age.  Then he had to fill in the proper information necessary to make the changes complete.  He started by typing the name of his father, John.  Then he typed the age of eight, which is a perfect age for a kid.  After that, he made the mental change to on because his father wants to become young both inside and out.  After that, he left the clothing option off since it would be funny to see himself shrinking in his own clothes, which it was a suit he’s still wearing after his work.  Next he set the awareness to on so his dad will experience the regression first hand without having to deal with him forgetting about it entirely.  Another thing he has to do was changing reality. Since he’s going to regress his father into a little kid, it could be problematic if the rest of his family will be confused as to why his father isn’t around why a young kid is with them.  So that’s why he decided to make the reality around him and his father change.  That way, no one will notice his father gone and they will think the newly regressed kid is part of the family.  The last thing he wanted to do was the duration of the change.  Jeff thought about it long and hard and was a little worried about how to approach this.  It should be a long enough duration so that his father will experience it.  So thinking this through, he decided on a full twenty minutes.  Not to fast, not to slow, just enough for him to see the regression first hand.<br />
<br />
After putting those options down, Jeff turned to his father and said, “Well dad.  What do you think?”  John looked to the information his son put and read through the option.  After reading this, he was a little confused by some of it.  “Well this is interesting…” he said, “Says you’re going to make me an eight year old kid both physically and mentally.  Then you left my clothing change off.  Then altering reality.  What are you trying to do Jeff?”  Jeff looked to his father and said, “Well you did say that you want to be a kid so we could bond together.  What better way then to change you both in body and mind?  The altering reality part is so that the family wouldn’t suspect you missing and the mysterious boy is in place.  As for the clothes changing option…  Well…  I just want to see how funny it is to see you in oversized clothes.”  His father looked at the options again and felt a little worried.  “I don’t know about this Jeff,” he said, “Do you really think all of this is necessary?”  Jeff turned to his dad and said, “You said you want to be young and bond right?  Well this is the perfect opportunity.  So, you’re ready?”  John looked at the information his son put down and sighed to himself, saying, “As ready as I’ll ever be.”  Jeff smiled and went back to the computer to click on the start button.  There was then a warning telling about what would happen next.  Reading the message, he understood the terms and clicked the ‘ok’ button.<br />
<br />
The moment he started the changes, John started to feel a tingle in his body and wondered about that.  “What was that?” he asked a little confused.  Jeff looked at him and realized what it was.  “It must be the start of the changes.  Normally it starts with a little tingling before the real changes manifest.” he said, “In fact, I think the changes are starting.”  Jeff’s father looked at him oddly and said, “Really?”  Jeff gestured for him to turn to the mirror to look at himself.  Turning to the mirror, John notices no change on his body.  He was in his mid forties and was a little bit in bad shape.  He had a belly gut on his stomach that wasn’t too bloated for him, but he looked out of shape.  Thankfully he had his suit on so no one won’t know the difference.  He still felt a little weak with flabby muscles and a soft chest, yet he’s still a little fit with his athletic workout he did back in high school.  His face was a little worn as he had wrinkles around his eyes and mouth and he had thinning hair on his head, leaving some bald spot on the back.  Even his beard he trimmed to be just around his mouth and on his chin has a few grays here and there.  So basically, he wasn’t as handsome as before.  But as he was starring at the mirror, John noticed something a little different about him.<br />
<br />
Approaching the mirror, he got a closer look at himself and spotted something strange.  Looking at the top of his head, he noticed a few hairs growing in on the spots that were empty.  He also notices a few gray hairs darkening into his natural dark brown color while the bald spot on the dome was filling in.  Looking at his hair, he immediately came to a conclusion.  “Oh my god…  You’re right Jeff,” he said in pure excitement, “it’s actually working.  I’m growing younger!!”  Jeff smiled and knew that his dad liked it.  “I knew you’d enjoy it.” He said with an anticipated look to his face.  John looked on to see his face youthening before his eyes as the gray on his hair is slowly disappearing and his bold spot is filling in bit by bit.  Even the gray flecks of his beard was filling with his dark brown.  But then, he felt a little tightness in his suit and it was getting a little uncomfortable.  So stepping back, he could see that his suit was showing signs of it being a little wear and tear.  So he quickly removed his tie, vest jacket, and button shirt to get a good look at himself.  What he saw was truly shocking to him.<br />
<br />
Wearing only his white V-neck T-shirt, he could see his muscles slowly returning.  His arms were so evident because they were getting a little hard and not as flabby as before.  He could even see his stomach feeling less rounded then before as all the excess fat from the beer and food was being removed.  He looked on in awe and was surprised to see his body returning to the shape it once was.  “Wow Jeff, this is amazing.” He said, “I never thought this machine would get my body back.”  Jeff watched on, as he was intrigued to see what his dad looks like before converting into a younger age.  “Get use to it dad,” his son said, “Cause it won’t last long.”  John nodded, as he understands that he will grow younger, and in turn, won’t have this body of his.  But at least it’s only temporary since he will return to normal.  So he looked at his body as it regressed into his thirties.<br />
<br />
His body continues to get all tones up as the softness of his muscles hardened and regained its youthfulness.  His stomach starts to flatten, leaving a little pouch instead of a huge stomach.  He could feel his chest broaden while his pectorals rose higher and was looking less flabby.  His face was regaining its luster with the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth fading away and smoothing out.  His hair had very little gray and the beard his no gray what so ever.  Even the balding areas were filling in with more hair covering the clear skin and looked more youthful then before.  Looking on, John was just enjoying himself and liked to see his body was getting younger by the minute.  He started to flex his muscles as they continue to get stronger and stronger.  During his posing, his body starts to youthen further t his twenties.<br />
<br />
He now looked like a football jock from his senior days in college.  His muscles grew hard and toned with no weakness anywhere.  His stomach became flat as a board and indents of his six-pack abs began to show.  He slowly untucked his shirt and lifted it up to reveal his defined abs, liking what he sees.  He looked to his chest and enjoyed the end results with his hardening pecs and a speckle chest hair.  Even his face showed no sign of his old self.  There was no gray, no bald spots, and no wrinkles.  He was something women will do a drool on.  John continued to pose and felt incredibly happy that he got his old body back temporarily.  Even Jeff looked at him and was surprised at how good his dad was back in the day.  “I got to say dad, for a young man, you’re certainly a head turner for the women.” he said.  His dad turned to him and said, “What can I say, I was quite a stud back in the day.  In fact, this is how I met your mother back in college.  She was so lovely that day.  It’s no wonder why I married her.  Wait…  Did I even remember marrying her?  Better yet, did I have you as a son?  My brain feels a little fuzzy…”  Jeff noticed it too and realized what is happening.  During his inputting of data for his father’s change, he made the regression mentally as well.  So not only his body is regressing, but also his brain as well as memories of his wife, job, and family were fading away.  He’s now back to his college days and slowly regressing through them.<br />
<br />
Regressing further, he could feel his hormones returning and he felt turned on.  It was almost like he was on overdrive as his attention turns to his pants to see something stirring.  Pulling his zipper down, he saw his dick starting to raise higher and slowly poking out of his boxers.  Touching the tip, he felt a little pleasure as he grabbed his shaft and stoke it gently.  Jeff saw his father doing that and peered his eyes away, telling him to stop it.  “Ew!  Dad!  Don’t do it in front of me!  That’s disgusting!!!”  John turned to his former son and said, “It’s not my fault!  All this regressing is bringing me back to my sexual activity days back in college.  I can’t control it!  And by the way, call me John from now on.  I don’t fell like a father anymore.  Remember?”  Jeff looked at him and could tell that his father isn’t his father anymore.  Rather, he’s a college Jock that is a ladies man.  So he rubbed the back of his head and said, “Right.  Sorry about that Da-  Er-  I mean John.”  John smiled about it and continue to look himself at the mirror while softly stroking his dick.  As he was enjoying himself, he could see himself leaving his twenties and into his teens as his body was loosing what makes a man.<br />
<br />
He started to loose a few inches of his height, going through his first reversal growth spurt and was close to below the five foot mark.  He could see his muscles shrinking bit by bit as his arm looked a little less hard and thin.  Yet he still has that physic to him since he started to work out since the start of high school.  His fact was slowly loosing it’s adult look too as his jaw line looked a little rounder.  Rubbing his beard, John then notice that it was a little shorter and shrinking into his skin, meaning that he’s going back to the time to when he stopped shaving around his mouth.  Even his hair was starting to get a little shaggy, as he never had much of a haircut in a few years.  He could feel his brain getting lighter as years of college education and memories in his twenties disappeared completely.  New bound energy was entering his youthful body and his hormones were in complete overdrive.  John was now an 18-year-old high school graduate with strong ambitions and a bright future ahead of him.  Jeff kept on watching and was impressed at how his former father looked as an older teen.  “Wow John, look at you.” He responded, “You reminded me of one of those jocks I see at the football field.”  John kept on admiring himself at the mirror and said back to his former son, “Oh it’s no big deal Jeffy.  Been working out to keep me strong and healthy since I was thirteen.  Gotta keep myself in tip top shape.”  He continues to look good in the mirror, knowing that it will be a matter of time before he looses all of his assets.  At that moment, he could feel himself shrinking though his teens as his body and mind continues to regress.<br />
<br />
John continued to shrink further and further to his childhood as his body was loosing all of his traits that made him a man to begin with.  All the muscles on his body shrank rapidly as he was looking very skinny, entering his thin phase.  In fact, the clothes he had on were getting a little baggy as his pants were too big for his legs to hold, even with his belt to tighten with.  So he held his pants with one hand while holding his dick with the other.  Speaking of which, his penis was looking far smaller then he though, like around the five incher as his testosterone was feeling less energetic.  All of his body, arm and leg hair thinned incredibly and was nothing but a thin speckle.  Even his face was incredibly childish.  His face was rounder and his jaw was softer while his beard was no more.  All that’s left was a few hairs over his lips, making him look like an awkward teenager.  Even his hair on top of his head was completely shavel as he never had much was a haircut in his life.  Jeff looked at his former dad and could tell that he was right as John went from being an eighteen-year-old senior to a fifteen-year-old freshman.<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed at John’s lanky phase and said, “Wow John, I never really thought you were that skinny.  No wonder why you’ve been working out since high school.”  John looked at him and agued back.  “Hey!  It’s nOt mY FauLT THat I had TO be sKINny to BEGin wITH!  I hAd to wORK oUt SO I WOn’t be PiCKed on BY bULLies!”  His eyes grew wide as he could tell that the sound of his voice was cracking.  Placing his hand on his throat, he could feel his Adams apple shrinking as he was entering his prebubesant stage.  He even rubbed his head as his mental regression was shrinking fast while all knowledge of his high school years vanished away.  The preteen continued to regress while Jeff watched the metamorphosis takes place in front of him.<br />
<br />
John shrank below four feet as he entered puberty in reverse.  His muscles were long gone as he was a thin as a twig.  All the hair on his body vanished completely with the exception of the hair on his head.  The pubic hair around his privates thinned completely as it sank back to his sin, leaving his lower region bare.  His dick grew shorter and the stiffness went completely limp, making it unable to erect at the age he is in.  In fact, his knowledge of sex vanished in his head, leaving him with nothing but curiosity in his privates.  His face was completely childish with his cheeks a little puffy his hair a little shaggy, and skin devoid of any facial hair what so ever.  Looking at himself in the mirror, John could tell that he was now a mere 12-year-old on the cusp of puberty.<br />
<br />
Being that he couldn’t hold his pants together, John decided to let go of his pants, letting it fall to the ground.  He also stepped out of his shoes and socks, being that they were too big for him.  The only thing that he was keeping him from being naked was his white T shit, which acted as a male dress for him.  See his scrawny and childish frame, he was amazed at how much has changed for him.  “Look at me,” he said in a childish voice, “I look like a little kid.  Sound like one too.”  Jeff watched on and said to his former father, “Don’t celebrate yet John, because the changes aren’t finished yet.”  With that said, John felt one last tingle as he was going through one last regression phase.<br />
<br />
He had grown a little shorter, into his mid three-foot length as his body was taking a different direction.  He could see a little fat build up on his arms and legs while his stomach had a little pout.  This means that John was developing baby fat in some places.  His face was completely childish as his cheeks started to puff up a little more and his nosed looked a little short and stout.  His hair was then a complete mess too as it looked like he had that look when he woke up.  Finally, his brain was feeling lighter as all of his memories up to that age were gone.  It’s like the weight of the world was lifted off his shoulders as memories of school, college, married life, family, and work was removed from his life.  Now all he cares about is playing games and spending time with his old brother, Jeff.  With the changes complete, John went from being working husband and father of forty-five to an 8-year-old kid without a care in the world.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to him and asked, “John?  Are you okay?”  John looked to the mirror for a brief moment until he turned to his former son and said, “Okay?  No Jeff I don’t feel okay.  I feel great!  This is so cool.  I’m now young again!  No more grown up stuff for me!  Just feel like playing all day with you bro.  In fact, my mind is thinking you as my brother.”  Jeff listened to him and realized that he does have a point.  He doesn’t remember John as a father no more, but now as a younger brother.  He even has memories about him having fun with his new younger brother.  Obviously, the alter reality option started to kick in as it changed the reality to match John’s new age and life.  Now everyone would think that his former father is now his brother except for Jeff and John.  Now that everything had changed, Jeff looked to his new younger brother and said, “So, what do you think we can do, little bro?”  John thought about this and decided on.</p>
