<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time you reach the kitchen table you are ravenous.<br />
<br />
Grizz greets you and sits you down.  The table is piled high with food to the point of almost groaning.  <br />
<br />
He takes the cigar from your hand and says, &quot;Gus my son, you better eat it and eat it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't need to be told twice as you dig in.  You shovel in food, mostly meats, some starches like potatoes and corn and very little in the way of vegetable matter except what you imagine would supply you with vitamins.  You pack it away and as you do you notice you are growing: you only notice this because you have to shift how you sit in the chair as you change and the fact that your clothes are getting tight.<br />
<br />
You are building muscle, bone and some fat as you eat and Pops, Richie, Grizz and his four other brothers are dead quiet.  They seem very concerned about you and Pops whispers to Grizz occasionally.  You don't care at the moment.  You figure this is some sort if initiation and you're going to prove that you can eat everything on the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
Two hours pass and it seems that the food is converted within minutes to your mass.  When the table is almost clear you start to slow down and with one last dinner roll on the platter, you push it away and say, 'Enough' in a deep rumble.  <br />
<br />
You are very sleepy, you look down at your body and are only mildly surprised to see the changes because your thinking has grown very fogged and not surprised at all to see that you are naked and sitting in a pile of ripped clothing.  You briefly examine yourself.  You've got a thick medium length beard that is somewhat caked in food and you chest is only just less furry than your face.  Your strong, muscular arms are covered in thick hair as is your muscular tree-trunk legs.  You can feel the hair on your back as the air from the fan ripples through it.  You cover the now huge cock you have with the remains of your T-shirt, now that you notice it's visible.  You run a hand over your head and notice that your hair is thin on top but not gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Gus, we need to get you cleaned up and into bed.&quot;  Grizz says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;  You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rapid transformation.  We don't know what causes it, but it happens to some of us werebears.&quot;  Pops says.  &quot;Happened to my great grandfather and it almost killed him.  If they hadn't slaughtered a calf for him, he would have starved to death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... I could have died?&quot;  You say in your bass rumble, somewhat amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have starved to death.&quot;  Bull says to you.  It's a good thing you weren't alone today and that we were able to get this much food this fast.<br />
<br />
You yawn and pat your substantial &quot;Bear Belly&quot; with a large hairy hand.  &quot;So, I'm really a werebear?  This isn't a joke?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you're my Bear son by blood rite and a full werebear just like Richie here, 'cept you grew up real fast.  I'd say you're age is somewhere around thirty by the looks of you, but you don't need to mourn for your youth, we werebears are virtually immortal barring severe injury or murder and even that takes some doing.&quot;  Grizz says puffing on his cigar.  &quot;Time to get you to a shower and bed.  You're in for a long sleep while your body tries to sort itself out.  Pops says there'll be minor changes yet, but you pretty much look the way you will for the rest of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that you new family bids you goodnight and Grizz helps you up the stairs to the shower, you clutch the T-shirt rag all the way to the shower.  You have trouble walking as your balance is off and your legs are a bit wobbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;When will I change into a werebear?&quot;  You ask your father.<br />
<br />
&quot;After you've slept for awhile, my son.&quot;  Grizz says, &quot;I have ancient lore to pass down to you, but that can wait until you've rested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grizz gets you into the shower; you start cleaning the food off your huge hairy body, yawning deeper and deeper as the hot water soothes your aching bones and muscles.  You jack off in the shower and you can hear Grizz chuckle as you grunt.  You really don't give a shit, you're a man and need release and if Grizz happens to overhear, well, he's a man and understands a man's needs.  <br />
<br />
By the time you're finished, you are so sleepy you want to just curl up on the floor and sleep.  Grizz makes sure you make it to your bed and almost before your head hits the pillow you are asleep.  Grizz covers your naked hairy body as you snore deeply.<br />
<br />
**********************<br />
<br />
Pops is standing in the doorway and Richie is there too.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do you figure he'll sleep, Pa?&quot;  Grizz says around his cigar to Pops.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rapid transformation takes about a solid week of sleep, maybe two.  That fat he put on tonight will tide him over, but damn if he didn't put on a freakish amount of muscle.  He's bigger than you are son and he doesn't even know it yet because his brain is half bear at the moment.  Damn near all he was thinking about were the survival essentials.&quot;  Pops says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was great-great-great grandpa G&uuml;nther that big?&quot;  Richie asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, maybe a bit smaller than your brother, Richie.  I had no idea Gus was of the line of Ursos Champions, it's a proud mark to be descended of a 'Swift Skin' as your are son and it looks like your brother Gus comes from a proud line of bear warriors too.  That rapid change only happens if there's 'Swift Skin' bear blood somewhere in your veins.&quot;  Pops says.<br />
<br />
As it dawns on Grizz, his great form puffs up with pride; &quot;Both of my sons are mighty Bears!  The son of my loins is growing up to be a 'Blood Rager' and the son of my blood is 'Swift Skin'.  There are might deeds you two could do, incredible feats of strength and valor.<br />
<br />
Pops chuckles, &quot;Easy there now, son, that was a different age.  The Order of Ursine Knights has dwindled down to a few handfuls here in America and a few more in Europe and most all of us haven't fought as bears in over a hundred years.  Better to let the world think we're just rowdy, uncouth bikers and the Berserkers are a legend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know, Pa…  No Camelot for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pops shuts the door to the bedroom where his new adult sized grandson lies sleeping.  He will grow a little taller, Pops knows, and put on a little more muscle from his fat reserves; which could be augmented by exercise.<br />
<br />
The three drift down the stairs to serious conversation with Wolf, Snake, Bull and Tiger.<br />
<br />
***************<br />
<br />
Three weeks later, Gus awakens...</p>
