<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg, the pizza delivery guy, felt a twinge in his neck. He rubbed the spot and continued driving out of the neighborhood. He recognized his next delivery location. It was going to one of the frat houses near the local college campus. He vaguely remembered at one point wishing he could have joined this fraternity, but they had turned him away. As he drove, he readjusted his belt. It seemed a little tight on him. He began to feel an urge to start taking his clothes off in his car, but he ignored it for now. He reached for his soda cup and took a sip. While the straw was in his mouth, it turned into a cigar. Greg didn’t seem to notice. He scratched absentmindedly at his stomach. He felt a twinge in his dick as he rubbed his growing belly. He fondly recalled when he first began to grow this paunch. At a traffic light, he scooted the seat back as his legs lengthened and swelled. Greg smiled egotistically. Out of his entire Asian family, he was by far the tallest and largest of them. It gave him a sense of pride. He took another puff of his cigar.<br />
<br />
Greg finally pulled up to the frat house. He remembered fondly the first time he had gotten drunk in college. To Greg, that was now years ago, despite the reality that it had actually been last month. His body swelled even further as he aged a few years. He got out of the car and carried the pizzas to the door. One of the pizza boxes turned into a box of cigars. Feeling a peculiar urge, he opened the box and licked each of the cigars, his massive tongue coating the cigars evenly with his saliva. He shut the box and rang the doorbell. His body was slowly continuing to swell larger and larger with each passing second. Greg was also growing hornier and hornier with each passing second as well. Greg was oblivious to all of this that was happening to him. It did not alarm him when he felt his ears slowly rising up to the top of his head and changing shape. Nor did it bother him that he was starting to grow a thick coat of black hair on his arms. He rubbed a thick hand through the white hair that was growing on his face. God, he was so horny.<br />
<br />
The door opened, and a young man in a suit and tie appeared from within the house.<br />
<br />
“Finally, pizza’s here!” the young man announced. He hadn’t looked into Greg’s face just yet. He was eyeing the pizza and the cigar box. The guy opened the cigar box and peered inside. “What are these for?”<br />
<br />
“What do you think, boy?” Greg growled. He picked one up and stuck it into the guy’s mouth. Any protests the guy had seemed to die in his mouth. The cigar lit itself, but this fact was missed by the two individuals on the front porch of the frat house.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name, cub?” Greg asked, rubbing his crotch with meaty clawed hand.<br />
<br />
“D-Drew,” the boy stuttered. Drew’s stomach was already starting to push out against his white button-down shirt.<br />
<br />
“Mine’s Greg.” He pulled Drew in close. “But you can just call me Daddy.” He pulled the cigar out of his mouth and planted his slightly distended mouth on Drew’s. He blew the cigar smoke into Drew’s mouth and stuck his tongue deep inside the boy’s mouth. Drew moaned. After a few seconds, they came up for air.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Drew mumbled. “I’ll call you whatever you want me to, Daddy.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” Greg growled possessively. “Give your buddies these. And then come right back.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir!” Drew replied enthusiastically. His arms were swelling even quicker than his stomach at the moment. He pawed at his crotch and carried the cigar box deeper into the house.<br />
<br />
Greg stared at Drew’s retreating and swelling rear end as he walked away. He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to his boss with the phrase, “I’ll be a little late getting back. Daddy’s going to get lucky.” He pocketed his phone and rubbed his dick through his pants. The buttons on his shirt gave way, and his large furry belly stuck out significantly in front of him. With his free hand, he rubbed the thick white and black fur. His pants still somehow managed to hold his ass in. Greg’s small little tail twitched in horny anticipation of the fun he was going to have soon. With each twitch of his tail inside his pants, it sent a tingle up his spine and then straight back to his hardening erection. Greg smiled. He’s going to fuck each and every one of these boys like the bear he is.</p>
