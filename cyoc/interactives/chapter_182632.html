<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dude, really?&quot; Ian said, baffled at the fact that Trevor decided to swap bodies with his younger brother. Of course, he was slightly relieved when Trevor did not pick him. Which kinda makes him feel that his current protests are not legitimately out of concern.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What? It&#39;s just a game and I don&#39;t think the game would permanently place us in the other&#39;s body.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The white card in the air flipped and bright golden light filled the room. The light did not last long and dissipated within a second. It might have left fast, but the consequences it left are now becoming apparent. Trevor looked at his limb with confusion present in his eyes. Jim is smiling from ear to ear while his hands scour his body.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Holy fuck!&quot; Trevor said, rejoicing at the fact that he turned 8 years younger. &quot;It worked!&quot; He jumped in the air and took notice of how light and nimble his body is.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I- I&#39;m in an adult&#39;s body!&quot; Jim said, &quot;My voice is so deep. Ian, look!&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Good lord,&quot; Ian muttered to himself.<br />
 <br />
The white card fell on the floor. On its surface is a timer set to thirty minutes. When Ian touched it, the timer started to trickle down on its way to zero.<br />
 <br />
&quot;That leaves us with thirty minutes to have our fun,&quot; Trevor said in his pre-pubescent voice. He looked at the clock and it was barely past seven. That leaves them with a few more hours to have more swaps after this. But first, he grabbed Ian by the hand and led him to another room. &quot;You two boys do your fun while we do our thing.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Out in the room and into another, Trevor and Ian sat on the floor inside Trevor&#39;s room. The room is nothing but a mess. Clothes are strewn on the floor, the scent of deep male perfume hangs in the air, and posters of video games are found across the walls.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Jesus christ Ian, did you teach your younger brother the birds and the bees yet?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
 <br />
Ian looked at him, confused and afraid. He doesn’t think that he is going to get used to hearing Jim talk to him like an adult in his 20s. &quot;What? No. I was planning to then the whole thing with the school shooter happened. And I can&#39;t find the right time to tell him. Why?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Your younger brother is hard as fuck. Didn&#39;t you notice?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Why the hell would I notice? I don&#39;t often sneak a peek at my brother&#39;s crotch throughout the day. Where are you getting this question?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Did you see the videos we watched on the computer before?&quot; Ian heard of this question and he was quick to nod his head in disagreement.<br />
 <br />
&quot;No. I see what you mean, and the answer is no. I want to have sex, but with my younger brother? It&#39;s just weird.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Psh. He won&#39;t even know before the thirty-minute mark is up. It&#39;s a quickie. Do me, and I&#39;ll do you. Just to get this stiffy off my pajamas.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Ian looked at Trevor, now donning the face of his younger brother. The features may be of his younger brother, but everything else screams of his best friend. And he is sure as hell that Jim would not make that thirsty look with those eyes.<br />
 <br />
Trevor huffed. His cheeks are burning him, and the more this goes on, the more painful his dick becomes. And throughout the entire two minutes, since he was placed in this body, he has not even taken a peek at his new manhood. Without even taking Ian&#39;s permission, he undressed his pajamas revealing the three-inch uncut wiener beneath. It&#39;s a cute little thing, and it has already become pink from getting so hard. The head is already peeking out of the foreskin.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh, what the hell,&quot; Ian said before pushing Trevor on the bed and began slobbering his tongue on his skin. Ian never had the thought that he would do this to his younger brother&#39;s body before. Because why would he? Nevertheless, the lack of thought in the past is not enough to stop his actions. He licked Trevor by the neck, tasting the film of sweat that has accumulated since coming here. Ian&#39;s tongue journeyed downward where he dabbled on the pair of pink nipples now poking hard from his ministrations.<br />
 <br />
Trevor flicked off his garments and did the same to Ian&#39;s. Now that he is in a younger body, Ian looked gigantic and equally menacing. He&#39;d be lying if he didn&#39;t feel a shred of fear of what is about to come.<br />
 <br />
Ian laid over Trevor, the surface of their sweaty skins touching another in a warm embrace. Their members frotted on one another with Ian taking the charge of connecting their penises of differing size. They huffed, their breath misting on the cold air-conditioned room. Trevor moaned, which is more akin to a mewl thanks to his voice.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Why haven&#39;t we done this in our real bodies before?&quot; Ian said as he pumped his hands up and down on their penises.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You never asked, but we could do it once we&#39;re back to normal.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; Ian hit a good spot, &quot;We should.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Trevor copied whatever Ian was doing. He used his smaller tongue to taste Ian&#39;s clean-shaven chest and pink nipples. He poked his nose inside Ian&#39;s pits and licked the briny surface clean. Then he led his tongue upwards, where both of their tongues connected into a wet and lengthy kiss. Trevor, being the smaller one, was more vulnerable to Ian&#39;s maturity and strength. Ian prodded his tongue inside, tasting Trevor&#39;s saliva and the hint of the Doritos from this dinner&#39;s snack. Ian kept on kissing, sucking every essence from Trevor&#39;s mouth until the two of them could barely catch their breath. Everything they are doing is making them even harder, and even hungrier to push their intercourse to the next level.<br />
 <br />
Seeing that his pre-pubescent penis is not long enough to penetrate Ian&#39;s ass, Trevor reduced his expectations to an equally enjoyable blowjob. He pushed Ian&#39;s head downwards into his groin, where Ian easily popped the entire groin into his mouth. He marbled the dark-pink balls with his tongue while keeping the penis bobbing inside his mouth.<br />
 <br />
The pleasures are too much, and Trevor could barely keep his eyes on Ian. Trevor gurgled a moan in the air, with a tear dripping out of his eyes. Ian continued to lick him, suck him till he was practically screaming. It&#39;s a good thing that the room is padded or the other boys could hear them scream each other&#39;s names.<br />
 <br />
Ejaculating for the first time is a world of its own. Trevor could barely remember how it felt, but what he is feeling right now reeled him back to memory lane. His mind is a sea of honey. Complete thoughts could not even bubble to the surface. Tears are gushing out of his eyes and his mouth is spilling over with unswallowed saliva. The pressure building in his groin feels alien and taboo. One small push and could break his weak sanity and body. But the feeling is a train that cannot be stopped, especially with Ian&#39;s mouth continuing to bob his mouth up and down on the prepubescent member.<br />
 <br />
&quot;AHHHH!&quot; Trevor moaned. Cum came out in streams. Thick slimy cum flowed like a spurting house, and Ian&#39;s mouth was there to swallow it all. &quot;Fuck! Fuck! Ian, I&#39;m fucking cumming. I&#39;m cumming!&quot;<br />
 <br />
Tried as he might, Ian could not swallow all the punk. As he tried to swallow one batch, a spurt exploded on his face and covered him in its slime. Ian scooped some of the cum, and slathered it on his dick.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Ian asked.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I- I think so… Ejaculating for the first time is a different kind of high, man. You should try it on, Isaac.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Ian could if the fate and luck from the cards allow him to do so.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to flip you over now,&quot;<br />
 <br />
Trevor nodded his head, as he flipped over and exposed his ass in front of Ian. With his dick lubricated with his younger brother&#39;s semen, Ian slowly slipped his dick inside and was welcomed by a tight wall of flesh around him. Barely an eighth was inside and Trevor was already writhing in pleasure and pain. It&#39;s too tight, and he doesn&#39;t think Ian&#39;s manhood could fit in. And there he used to think that Ian&#39;s manhood is a sorry sod for its average length.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Fuck! Be careful. Don&#39;t want to rip your younger brother&#39;s asshole don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Ian only heard three or four words of what he said. Being inside another person&#39;s ass reduced his mind to a single goal of being pleasured. He pushed further inside, which made Trevor scream and claw on the mattress of the bed. Trevor grits his teeth and heaves through the pleasure and pain.<br />
 <br />
One fully inside, Ian rested for a bit and let Trevor&#39;s ass adjust to his engorged member. Trevor sighed a breath of relief until Ian ended the grace period and started pegging him. Trevor&#39;s ass and Ian&#39;s groin pounded on a rhythmic slap of flesh on flesh. Each step earning a gritting moan and craning of the other&#39;s throat. Fucking another man in the ass is better than a hundred masturbation, Ian thought.<br />
 <br />
As he pounded on Trevor&#39;s ass, Ian opened his eyes and looked at the body he was violating. He never saw it in this way before, but damn, his brother looks cute when he is being fucked. He doesn&#39;t want to say that it&#39;s a good thing, but he is happy that the cards allowed him to have this opportunity. He gulped a mouthful of saliva as he released a week&#39;s worth of semen. Ian swore that Trevor came for the second time as he did.<br />
 <br />
There they lie on the afterglow of what they did. Their chests rose and fell, each catching a gasp of breath. With the ten minutes they have left, they spent it cleaning up their bodies and dressing in a new set of pajamas. However, Trevor is afraid that Jim might feel numbness in his ass after they turn back to normal.<br />
 <br />
Ian and Trevor went back to the guest room where they saw their younger brothers getting drunk on soft drinks.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Did you two boys have fun?&quot; Ian asked.<br />
 <br />
Jim chuckled in Trevor&#39;s voice, &quot;Yes, we did.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The white card rose from the floor and uttered its new set of words.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Time is up<br />
<br />
Trevor - 1<br />
Ian - 0<br />
Jim - 0<br />
Isaac - 0<br />
<br />
Five games left.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Trevor expected that the change would turn them back to normal but nothing is happening so far. So, they guessed that the game must continue and see its end before they turn back to normal.<br />
