<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now let&#39;s see here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Time stretched on as Larry flipped through the book one handed trying to make sense of it while his other arm kept me in a headlock. I tried to signal to Greg without tipping off Larry that we needed to get the book back. But Greg was completely mesmerized with Larry&#39;s slowly stiffening trunk. After a few minutes it appears he couldn&#39;t resist any longer. He fell to his knees and reached out to grab the over-sized cock, bringing it to his mouth. He barely managed to touch his lips to the tip of the enormous appendage before Larry pulled away and used a foot to shove Greg onto his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Settle down you little cocksucker, maybe I&#39;ll let you lick the log later once you&#39;ve earned it&quot; Larry gave Greg&#39;s disappointed face a few light taps on the cheek with his fat cock. &quot;Now be a good boy and write what I say using your fancy words and numbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry tossed the book at Greg who barely caught it. Maybe there was a little hope. Surely Greg wasn&#39;t just going to write whatever Larry told him to right?<br />
<br />
Any hope I had vanished when Larry reached out the toe of his boot to gently twiddle with Greg&#39;s tiny weenie. Greg gave out a feeble moan before grabbing a pen from the nearby coffee table and giving Larry his full attention. He seemed completely entranced by the cock teasingly bobbing up and down in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of get rid of all these gay ass massive cocks everywhere. I don&#39;t wanna have to watch giant dicks flopping around every second of the day, Change them back to the normal 8 or whatever inches. I still want to keep mine though. But make sure enough other guys have them that I&#39;m not some kind of freak.&quot; Larry started as Greg started to scribble.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s also too many tiny dicks running around. One in four men? I don&#39;t want to be surrounded by fairies drooling over me and my fat cock all the fucking time. Besides I know little Jason wants be special. He wasn&#39;t happy just being below average he had to be right at the bottom. And it makes it more embarrassing if he actually has something to hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
I tried to scream at Greg as he eagerly rewrote some of the book entries but the sounds were muffled by the sour underwear shoved in my mouth. I could just make out the changes he was making:<br />
<br />
&quot;Average Penis sizes for 1% of men classified as &quot;large-dick&quot;:<br />
Erect: 13-15 inches<br />
Flaccid: 11 inches<br />
<br />
Average Penis sizes for 98% of men classified as &quot;average-dick&quot;:<br />
Erect: 7-10 inches<br />
Flaccid: 6-8 inches<br />
<br />
Average Penis sizes for 1% of men classified as &quot;small-dick&quot;:<br />
Erect: 1 inch<br />
Flaccid: ½ inch&quot;<br />
<br />
With the new sizes I felt my half inch dick double in size to a one inch nub of needful erection. At least it was something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Secondly I don&#39;t wanna have to wait in line behind a bunch of other dudes to get my cock sucked so make sure the average guys know guys like me have first dibs.&quot; Larry paused for a moment thinking &quot;And I don&#39;t want guys with normal dicks being able to control small-dick guys the same way big-dick guys can. All the good cock-suckers will be snatched up before I get a chance at them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg flipped the book over to a short paragraph about small dicks being embarrassed or something I didn&#39;t recognize and began adding to the end of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Average-dicks also seek to humiliate or dominate any small-dicks who have been exposed. While they are also comfortable in using them for sexual gratification, should any large-dick also desire to use a small-dick, average-dicks will defer to them as they find the added humiliation for the small-dick highly amusing. Where large-dicks can easily use their natural superiority to make the small-dicks bend to their will, average-dicks tend to rely on blackmail and threats to coerce the small-dicks to perform deeds their submissive natures already desire, even if the small-dick denies as such. However large-dicks still employ blackmail and threats for the purposes of humiliation and domination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg finished writing and looked up from the book eager for Larry&#39;s next order, &quot;Third I don&#39;t want any tiny dick sympathizers walking around pretending to be real men. Any loser that lets someone stick a tiny cock in their ass or mouth can have nub dick too. Consider this my gift to little fairies like you Greg, who secretly wish to be at the bottom of the ladder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg nodded eagerly I could see him gyrating his hips back and forth on Larry&#39;s foot as he wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;Many small-dicks have difficulty finding partners that will allow them to top in oral and anal sex. Not just because of the general undesirability of their genitalia but also due to the fact that anyone who allows a small-dick to attempt penetration orally or anally shall themselves become a small-dick&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think of that?&quot; Larry asked, finally yanking the briefs out of my mouth, but still keeping me tightly held &quot;Anything you think I should add?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please&quot; I pleaded, &quot;Just give me a normal size dick again, I don&#39;t want to be part of all this small penis humiliation stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but I think you do. Greg only added all his perverted fetish world stuff after our little session this morning didn&#39;t he&quot; Larry looked down at Greg who obediently nodded in confirmation. Thanks again Greg. &quot;I saw the way you were stiff as a nail when I made fun of Greg&#39;s little seven inches. I saw you trying to rub your pint-sized pinky while you were sucking my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I-I&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right then, I&#39;ll let you pretend you have a chance at being a real man. You and I both know it won&#39;t happen but it&#39;ll be a laugh for me when you fail.&quot; Larry turned his attention back on Greg, &quot;For every month one of you tiny dick losers goes without squirting their jizz at the thought of someone making fun of their pathetic cocks you&#39;ll get to grow half an inch until you have just enough to pass as a real man. But at any time until then, if you cum from thinking about how embarrassing your useless dicks are it&#39;ll shrink all the way back down. It&#39;ll be hilarious watching you nub dick fairies trying to play big boy and getting caught. And just as a bonus, if you fire off your spermies without being touched you can go down to half your normal size.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg continued writing like a madman.<br />
<br />
&quot;For every month that a small-dick does not ejaculate while experiencing or thinking about small penis humiliation (SPH), his penis will temporarily grow half an inch up to a maximum of 7 inches at which point he becomes an average-dick. If at any time should a small-dick reach orgasm while experiencing or thinking about SPH his penis shall shrink to it&#39;s original size. If the small-dick achieves orgasm through SPH without physical contact to it&#39;s genitals his penis will instead shrink to half it&#39;s original size. This further encourages small-dicks to hide their sizes and gives them hope to one day have normal penises, causing them to resist even harder and deny their submissive nature. As such it adds greatly to the humiliation when they inevitably surrender and anywhere from a month to a years worth of progress is lost. It also adds to feelings of inadequacy as their tiny penises are no longer due to a factor outside of their control but a direct result of their failures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s not what I meant!&quot; I whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;What think you can&#39;t last a year without popping off your pimple to the thought of being a tiny dick loser?&quot; Larry goaded me, causing my cock to shudder in pleasure &quot;Worried all your little college friends will find out and make fun of you? What if I sent them that video? You might not ever cum from normal fantasies again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could only whimper in response as Larry put images in my head. The idea that I had to last a whole year without cumming from SPH to be a normal man again. Surely I could manage, it&#39;s not like I enjoyed SPH... right? In any case it could be worse. I couldn&#39;t imagine how embarrassing it would be to have a half inch again. I could almost feel the humiliation already at everyone thinking I had a SPH fetish. Just the thought of it made me...oh no- NO- NO! I felt my untouched tiny cock perform a few involuntary spasm before releasing it&#39;s weak load onto the floor. Just as I had gained a half inch from the changes earlier I felt it quickly dwindling away as my penis shrank back down to a pitifully twitching half inch, before settling down into a quarter inch of flaccid shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that that&#39;s done&quot; Larry said cheerfully. &quot;I still haven&#39;t to decided what to do about my hacked TV&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait did he still think that was my fault? I watched the ink sink into the page and despite the dreaded sense of what was to come, my half inch boner returned to its hard and dripping state.</p>
