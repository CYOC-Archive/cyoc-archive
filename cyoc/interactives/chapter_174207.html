<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With an evil Cheshire grin, you run to the shed, where Chad is doing his after school workout. &quot;Chad will be aware of what I say next.&quot; You whisper, not wanting him to hear that part of your statement. You want chad to suffer to know that he was once the older brother, that he was the man that you are going to become in just a few short moments. You want him to feel what it&#39;s like to be bullied and mocked for not growing like the other kids. You want Chad to hear the words &quot;When you become a real man then we&#39;ll talk alright son.&quot; come from your father. Knocking on the door looking to find Chad&quot; What do you want twerp your killing the vibe.&quot; Your older brother says. &quot;I&#39;m 17 years old your 12 years old.&quot; Let&#39;s start small you thought. There was a blinding light and dizzy feeling like the world was shifting: reality had changed itself to the reality you had spoken of.<br />
Now standing in your living room with chad sitting next to you on the futon you realize that you are still in your old body just aged up. Though Chad is 12 and has now reverted to his prepubescent stage of the teen years he still has the potential to grow up into the asshole jock he was. That has to change. Looking at your new little brother, you contemplate your next move. The first order of business; make him a late bloomer. &quot;Hey, Chad do you want to know a secret.&quot; Yeah, play it off like a secret that&#39;s a good way to discreetly include him in the change. <br />
&quot; How do you have a secret to tell, you don&#39;t hang out with anyone, at least I have friends who come over.&quot; Chad says. Wow, the nerve on this kid just for that I might add a few extra changes that I wasn&#39;t going to do. you think. &quot; Just because, you&#39;re a late bloomer doesn&#39;t mean you get to be mean to everyone.&quot; You say to your younger bro. &quot;What no I&#39;m not David I&#39;m a 19-year-old 6&#39;4 quarterback.&quot; <br />
&quot; Not, anymore your a 12-year-old geek who gets bullied in school, a kid who plays WAY too many videogames and doesn&#39;t get enough sunlight, oh and you don&#39;t have very many friends just a couple of D and D friends named Paul and Wynston who are the only 2 people besides me and dad who will actually talk to you and not make fun of you for being weird.&quot; Chad looks at you for a moment then looks down at the carpet. His mental status changing to that of the gaming geek you made him be. With a new idea, you continue. &quot; If it helps little buddy, your one of the kindest most caring little brothers I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of meeting, your the only little brother I would want to have too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really, David how&#39;s that supposed to cheer me up.&quot; A pause hung in the air as you pondered your next phrase. &quot; Oh, come on man it can&#39;t be that bad, not really.&quot;  You look at your brother with interest and whisper silently. &quot; You look up to me I don&#39;t want to let you down. It feels like I haven&#39;t really spent that much time with you lately.&quot; Chad&#39;s demenor change almost instantly, like night and day. One moment he&#39;s still a little shit who doesn&#39;t- didn&#39;t- appreciate how much you cared for him despite his uncaring and disdain, to a little sibling looking for approval.<br />
As reality settled again the door comes open, your father has come home from work. &quot; Boys I&#39;m home, I brought pizza from the office for dinner David, get the plates we are eating separately tonight. I had to bring some paperwork and and important project home.&quot;<br />
&quot; Yeah, be right there dad.&quot; you say getting up.<br />
After eating your dinner you quickly dispose of the paper plate and look at your mirror. What you see doesn&#39;t exactly spark the happy feeling in your gut. But it will. you think. Your a 5&#39;4&quot; scrawny boney little guy, not much of a looker either. Rather average, the lower end of the spectrum. sighing you think of what you want to change first. If anything should change- what are you thinking everything is going to change now that you have this mysterious new power. &quot; I&#39;m a handsome young stud, the most handsome in the school.&quot; Instantly the world starts that weird spinning that makes you dizzy, you face stings a lot as your bones shift around to mold you and your memories to make the world think that you were the most handsome kid in school. Looking in the mirror you first notice you striking green eyes deepset and piercing. next your eyes delve deeper down to the contours of your now strong cheek bones and squared off jaw you look like a teen model though, something is still missing. Power, You are missing power, now that you have the ability- the power- to change your destiny your going to take hold of this opportunity. &quot; Not only am I the most handsome kid in the school but, the whole world. I&#39;m the most popular guy in the school as well, must have dude at all the parties.&quot; When you stop speaking the world around you shifts and your memories change. So does your attitude towards this power that you have been given. What you didn&#39;t realize is that when you changed yours and your brothers social status it also changed your personalities to fit the new you. When you looked down you noticed that you left your other assets out of the equation. &quot; No no no, this won&#39;t do I can&#39;t be this hot and not have a killer bod to go with it.&quot; taking all of your clothes except your underwear off you look into your closet quickly and notice that it looks like Chad&#39;s been in here storing his clothes again. &quot; Chad come get your stupid clothes out of my room!&quot; you shout, Chad quickly comes and grabs your old wardrobe and just as quickly takes his leave. &quot; Crap, I don&#39;t have any clothes anymore.&quot; With that off handed comment your Underwear instintaly dematierializes and you are in your room nude. Oops, you thought. Hey silver lining though it means you get to change more of your body without having to worry about tearing your clothes.<br />
<br />
Instantly you thought of what to do next.<br />
Swiftly moving to your mirror again looking at all your handsome glory, you think swiftly to yourself, &#39;I&#39;ll deal with you later.&#39; then you look down at your unimpressive phallic member. &quot; I have a 9in long, 13 in circumference schlong.&quot; you command of your Penis. It jumps into action. instanly you feel pain it subsides little by little but it&#39;s still there and it feels like you dipped your lower half into a vat of hot and white hot burning coals. You scream out in pain or so you thought you screamed when actually you whimpered and passed out because the burning sensation clouded your nerves and it became to much to handle.<br />
You woke up about 40 minutes later. Wondering if what you had experienced was just a dream that is until you sat up a decided you needed to pee. And so, you got up and walked into the ensuite bathroom- your father giving you the master bedroom when you moved into the penthouse apartment as a thank you for being so generous.- When you look down aim youswapr dick you notice it is rather swollen this early morning. &quot; OHHHH SHIT THAT&#39;S NOT SWELLING THAT&#39;S ACTUALLY MINE!&quot; you shout, It all came back to you in an instant the voice, knocking on the garage door, swapping roles with Chad; Everything came back to you in a tidal wave.<br />
After finishing up in the bathroom you go back into your room and look at your phone to check the time. Your phone read 1:45 AM. &quot; Luckily it&#39;s Friday going into Saturday.&quot; you mumbled tossing your phone back onto your king sized bed, headed toward the full length mirror.<br />
Let&#39;s see what to change next. you thought checking yourself out. If you had to admit, with your new title as most attractive teen in the world it was hard for even you to look away from your magnificence. Suddenly, you had a thought. A brilliantly wicked good thought. As selfish and greedy as it was this new you didn&#39;t seem to care much about that at all. &quot; Adding to my high status in the school social heiharchy, I will now be a charismatic god among my peers. The Guys will be jealous and want to be me, while the ladies what to do me.&quot; Suddenly your phone goes off there were 12 different parties that you were invited  to but opted out of going for the sake of playing with the powers.<br />
&quot;Dude, where are you.&quot; one of the texts read.<br />
Another one reads, &quot;David, your missing out on some serious ass.&quot;<br />
Then one from your crush from when you were a dweeb comes in. It says &quot;Hey baby I&#39;m sure your busy tonight helping watch your baby of a brother but I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out maybe hook up again sometime.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve fucked Monique Daily?&quot; you ask yourself, Just the thought of her gets you going. &#39;In a minute you.&#39; &quot;Wait, she likes taller guys why in the world would she want to take me?&quot;  Instantly you rush to the mirrior and speak almost rushed, &quot; I&#39;m 6&#39;9&quot; tall, weigh 247 lbs of pure muscle and am on the football team, the star quarterback.&quot; To be completly honest with yourself you were nervous with this change you were literally changing your body to be that of what monique likes in a guy you told yourself you wouldn&#39;t do that. Here you are, though you love the change so far Watching your legs grow with height strength was euphoric for you to witness. <br />
With a rippling throb your calves and thighs gain pound after pound of muscle and soon resemble that of tree trunks.<br />
Your butt gain a nice swell and amazing muscle to form a firm tight muscled bubble butt.<br />
your waist and abs tapering off, Abs rippling of into chunks of individual slabs of strength and power coming in 2 by 2 and creating a sexual aura around yourself that you can&#39;t help by moaning out, &quot;Yes, Yes I want more.&quot; Unbeknownst to you your body did indeed give you more. Instead of stopping at the 8 pack abs that would come with the raw strength you had asked for it gave you the added bonus of 2 extra abs.<br />
Pecs, by this point you were so into your sexual fantasy that you were seldom aware of the change. Strong, bulging pecs lay in front of your body not hidering your ability to move in any way but sexy all the same.<br />
Your bis and tris were the size of volleyball round and smooth to the touch, though tough and when flexed you could see the power they held within.<br />
The changes started to slow as you started to reach your height goal of 6&#39;9&quot;. &quot; Man, that felt amazing!&quot; you say coming out of your euporic haze. Though you realize that while you were in your subconscious you had cum all over your mirror and your room your were covered in sweat, and smelled of spunk. &quot; This is all cleaned up.&quot; Might as well take advantage of my powers you think inwardly.</p>
