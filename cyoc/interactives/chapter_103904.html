<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire was walking down the road from where the weretigers were meeting and towards the Moon Lake General Hospital.  She could see the hospital in the distance, and it really wasn&#39;t that far from it.  She thought about the dream she had last night, about the decision that she had to make.  She was certain about two things.  First is that she was in love with the town.  And the second is that she was in love with Ryan Conner.  She wanted to be with him.  And in order for that to happen, she had to change.<br />
<br />
The only question in her mind was which were did she want to be.  She&#39;d seen both Ryan and Barbara in their werewolf forms, and she&#39;d be lying if she said that she didn&#39;t find them attractive.  On the other hand, after being in that weretiger pride meeting, she loved the idea of being a weretiger even more.  The weretigers looked so beautiful, with the patterns in their fur, their strong bodies, and they seem to be so strong.  She was definitely leaning more towards being a weretiger than a werewolf at this point.<br />
<br />
While she was in her thoughts, she saw a car drive up next to her and stop.  &quot;Hey, pretty lady.  Need a ride?&quot;  Claire recognized the voice and the smirking smile, and returned the smile back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; she replied, &quot;but it&#39;ll cost ya.&quot;  She climbed into the car and sat in the passenger seat next to Ryan.  &quot;Can you take me to the Moon Lake General Hospital?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; he said as he made a U-turn and headed towards the hospital.  The smile on Ryan&#39;s face disappeared, and then he asked, &quot;You&#39;re really are going to go through with it, aren&#39;t you?  Be a weretiger that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she replied, &quot;that&#39;s why I was heading to the hospital.&quot;  Ryan didn&#39;t reply to that, but just sat there quietly thinking.  Claire was a bit uncomfortable with the silence and wondered if she did something wrong.  The two sat in the uncomfortable silence as the car drove to the hospital and parked in the parking lot.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; Claire said as she climbed out of the car, eager to get away from the uncomfortable silence.  <br />
<br />
Ryan also climbed out of the car to follow after Claire.  &quot;Claire, wait,&quot; Ryan called out to her as she started to walk towards the hospital.  Claire stopped and turned to Ryan.  &quot;Claire, before you go in there, there&#39;s something I want to say to you.  I know why you&#39;re doing this, and I know that you want to be a weretigress, but there&#39;s something that you should know first.  First is that I love you.  I&#39;ve fallen so deeply in love with you, and I think about you all the time.&quot;  Claire smiled as she heard this.  &quot;I want to support you the best I can, and I will support any decision that you make.  But...&quot; he paused as he pursed his lips and thought about what he wanted to say.  &quot;I can&#39;t help but feel a little disappointed and hurt that you&#39;ve decided to go this way.&quot;  He stopped talking for a bit and thought about his words as he walked closer to Claire.  &quot;I love you, and I was hoping that you would be a werewolf instead.  I was hoping that I would be the one who would induct you into were-life, and that we would be together for the rest of our long lives.  I was hoping that we could raise a litter of pups together, and that we would be happy.  If you go through with this, I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t know what will happen.  I don&#39;t know what will happen with our future together.  And...I can&#39;t help feel a little scared by that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire was touched by Ryan&#39;s openness.  She could see where Ryan was coming from on this.  &quot;Ryan Conner!&quot; she said with a bit of sharpness.  She walked up to him quickly, and at first she looked a little angry.  But then, she walked right up to him and kissed him deeply.  While they were kissing, she unbuttoned the top half of her shirt without Ryan noticing.  &quot;Ryan, let me ask you something.  No matter what happens, would you take care of me?&quot;  He nodded his head in agreement.  She smiled as she took his hand and put in her shirt and over her left breast.  He could feel her erect nipple and her heartbeat pounding through her chest.  &quot;I love you, Ryan, and I do want to be with you.  I know that you&#39;re a good man, and that you&#39;ll take care of me.  This is something that no one else can have, which is my heart.  No matter if I wear wolf fur or tiger fur, that part won&#39;t change.  We can still have the rest of our lives together, and instead of pups, it&#39;ll be kittens and pups.  But we can have our happy future together, no matter what I do tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled at Claire when he heard this, and removed his hand from her breast and then took her hand and put it down his pants.  &quot;And this is how much I love you, Claire.&quot;  Her hand could feel his penis, throbbing hot and hard.  Hearing him say that he loved her and feeling his erect penis was turning Claire on like she never felt before.  She was being turned on by this situation, and Ryan could smell it.  The two looked at each other, and Claire climbed up to Ryan&#39;s face.  The two started kissing, and it wasn&#39;t long before that kissing started to get very passionate.  Maybe it was the hormones coursing through their bodies, maybe it was the famous were-libido, maybe it was the pheromones in the air, but the two were going at it rather fiercely.  Claire knew that if they didn&#39;t stop soon, then she&#39;d soon be a werewolf. A pregnant werewolf.  And while she was set on being a weretiger, there was a part of her, after having this conversation, would be fine with being a werewolf and carrying&#39;s Ryan&#39;s baby.  Yet, there was another part of her that really wanted to be a weretiger, and that she wasn&#39;t ready to be a mother yet.  This part of her said that they should stop before things progress much further.  The only question is, which part will she listen to?<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Francis hung up the phone after talking with Claire.  &quot;Well, that progressed rather quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Claire.  She was asking about weretiger birth control pills.&quot;  Francis answered as she sat in the living room with Samantha.  &quot;It sounds like she&#39;s going to be joining the weretigers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that went smoother than usual.  I&#39;m just glad that we didn&#39;t have to force her change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.  I think we can chalk this one up as a happy ending.  And speaking of weretigresses...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Samantha paused as she took a sip of her tea, &quot;We have the matter of Kat and Martha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis thought for a moment and said, &quot;While I&#39;m happy that Martha has moved on and found someone else to love, but at this time, being pregnant with William&#39;s child and all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Samantha replied, &quot;And I just hope that Kat isn&#39;t using Martha as a &#39;fling&#39;.  Being pregnant means that Marth will need all the help she can get.  If Kat is just using her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it might turn bad for Martha and her family.&quot;  Francis nodded in agreement.  &quot;The thing is that we can&#39;t simply tell Martha who to date or not date, and what to do with her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed, but at the same time, we can&#39;t leave her alone in this either.  As her were-sisters, we do have a responsibility to take care of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis paused for a moment, and then said, &quot;I think we&#39;ll need to keep a close eye on Kat, and even talk to her to find out her intentions with Martha.  But we&#39;ll need to be subtle about it, though.  We can&#39;t tip our hand too fast, or it might backfire on us.&quot;  Samantha nodded in agreement.  &quot;Oh, that reminds me.  Tomorrow, I need to call Dr. Curray about Julie.  I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s been some interesting developments, but I don&#39;t know what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that can wait till tomorrow,&quot; Samantha said as she put down her tea.  She walked over to Francis with a rather seductive smile on her face.  &quot;One thing that I know right now is that this cat&#39;s ready to play.  And with all that&#39;s been going on, with Claire, with Julie, and now with Martha, this cat really needs to play.&quot;  She started to walk to their bedroom, sashaying her hips seductively.  Francis watched as she smiled, put down her tea, and followed Martha.</p>
