<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'Yeah your little prick, I get how it's a curse now.' Gill thought, she was now sitting in her <br />
living room with Jacob sitting on the other coach. Everything in the house was now to <br />
scale of her new nine-foot tall body. 'It's gonna be hell walking around at the station, Gary <br />
and the others were ready to bump heads in the ceiling down there as is...' <br />
<br />
Gill looked at the cub of hot coco that Jaccob had made for her. She remembered looking <br />
into the coco. <br />
<br />
'I remember you, you jerk. You had a shot at me. A turn at the game. You could have <br />
turned me into a slut whore or a law ornament like most of the other bastards like you <br />
have done to police over the years. But no, you had me, that stupid way the game seems <br />
to have of keep people playing it aren't interrupted in full force and what did you do <br />
instead? You made sure  no matter how much reality changes, no matter how much <br />
species, genders, race, age, and a million other things are screwed with by that game, I'd <br />
remember the way things used to be with crystal clarity. I thought you were retarded at <br />
the time. Then came that first really big change, and the one after that, and the one after <br />
that. You bastard. And unlike everyone one else, I have to get used to these screw ups with <br />
existence the old fashioned way! Yeah Serenity, I know, I don't see you moaning, but at <br />
least no matter what happens you stay a black human woman! But I've had my curse <br />
longer than you've had yours, and even you don't have the whole story.' <br />
<br />
Jaccob just sat back, watching Gillie stare into her coco, happy that she was now a lot <br />
calmer than when he had helped her into the living room and was no longer acting like a <br />
lunatic. <br />
<br />
 He hoped it wasn't a side effect of the mass flux that apparently the super witch Kurse <br />
had used to turn millions of the country's populace into donkey people and the other <br />
millions into elephant people, not to mentions all the OTHER fantastic horrific and almost <br />
beautiful things millions around the world into... THANK GOD IN HEAVEN they all reverted <br />
back into their original species once Kurse was destroyed and her power imploded (that <br />
people like Kat who had originally possessed a Turn of the Game with them before Kurse <br />
had spread her power had remained what they were turned into had been retrofitted by <br />
reality). <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready to talk about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BS.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing you can do to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we're not Prime Mates Gillie, and I'm happy with Marie. But we're still pack mates. <br />
And that means we look out for each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GILLIE!&quot; Jaccob shouted getting her full attention in the dark house.  &quot;We are a -PRIDE-, a <br />
family!  I don't know what happened! And I can't know unless we talk! And don't you dare <br />
say 'there's nothing to talk about' again! Or I'm bringing in every member of our pride in <br />
here one by one until you start letting it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Fine. You know the game right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard what happened.... Gillie. Is this about you not being there with the other pack <br />
members who are with the police? Your the chief. Your job is to stay where you're needed. <br />
I know it sounds heartless, but .... you were better off where you were back in Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill blinked in surprise, 'I forgot just how thorough these changes to existence -are-!'  &quot;It's <br />
not that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll think I'm insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you're planning to murder children in their sleep I have no intention of telling <br />
anyone what you tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill looked -very- aggravated at Jaccob's example and hissed at him. Jaccob stayed firm. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know how the game can change reality? I'm not supposed to be a lioness. Lion-<br />
people didn't even exist last week. I'm not even supposed to be a woman! The game <br />
changed everything! I don't even know how the game screwed with me this time! But I <br />
know it did!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jaccob controlled himself at everything Gillie was claiming, &quot;What do you mean 'this time?<br />
'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't the first time the game has royally f'ed with me and those around me. Or even <br />
the second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't matter anymore... because no one remembers but me and maybe some by <br />
Serenity... I ask where someone is, their own mother asks 'who?'  I ask what someone is <br />
doing in my home, and they swear on a bible we've been best friends for years... &quot;<br />
<br />
Jaccob picked up on that analogy. He shuddered at the mere idea he had forgotten <br />
children he once had, or that the Pride that he always been proud to be a part of hadn't <br />
existed a week ago. &quot;Gillie... I... I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as sorry as I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish others could remember then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glade they don't!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?! The changes I've seen over my life that no one else noticed? They'd be <br />
running around like chickens with her heads cut off screaming their lungs out, then get to <br />
the suicides and the mass hysteria... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never imagined YOU of all people Gillie would advocate ignorance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a difference between saying millions of innocent people weren't executed by the <br />
state... or pretending there isn't a serial killer on the loose whose immune to bullet, and <br />
telling others about things that no longer even happened. It's now no better than fiction. <br />
It's been so long I just figured I was done with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had these episodes before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the first to catch me while I shout out my aggravation and everything else out at <br />
the universe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm glade I'm finally the first one here to be there for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you believe me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be frank. It doesn't matter weather I believe you or not. What matters is as a pack <br />
mate, I'm here to be a shoulder to cry on if you need it. This is the only life I know and it's <br />
precious to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill thought, 'Women are treated like property in some countries. Yet are allowed to <br />
express their emotions more. What a screwed up world.'   &quot;Thanks. Shouldn't you be <br />
getting back to your family then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told my Prime Mate and cubs I'd be going to check on you, they understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
'Of course all packs have different traditions. It was dissonance of traditions that got the <br />
Big Bad Pack dumped on a boat and sent across the ocean to begin with.' Marie thought <br />
accidently learning Betty's very loud thoughts. <br />
<br />
Marie was just glade she -had- been modeled due to the shock wave into an -ideal- <br />
image of how Kurse saw herself. No normal person could hope to hold onto the power that <br />
was now looming behind her without crowing themselves king determined to 'fix' the <br />
world exactly like the witches had. If she had been a normal person with a normal <br />
psychology, Marie would have sought her own destruction... mostly cause the power she <br />
now wielded was truly terrifying to think about, and would easily corrupt anyone into <br />
declaring they would be the one to fix all the world's problems like a real life Mary Sue <br />
character. And Marie knew the moment she stepped on the slippery slop she'd be <br />
crowning herself queen of the planet Earth before the week was out.   'I  -have- to limit <br />
the use of the power I now have, like an addict with an addition, or I would fall into the <br />
exact same trap the witches had.'  <br />
<br />
+++++++++++ <br />
<br />
Marie walked with her fellow Choir Boys and Alter Boys. Of course her godfather had <br />
known they couldn't uphold their performance forever, but he had been hoping that she'd <br />
be at least a few years older before the signs started.  Marie being an early bloomer had <br />
been the absolute last thing anything the priest and Marie had thought of or wanted. <br />
<br />
Right now, no signs were outwardly visible, she had the same walk, the same face, the <br />
same hair, the same clothes, but now her chest was beginning to agitate her. But now she <br />
knew, SHE KNEW that this performance was going to reach it's conclusion soon, and Marie <br />
wasn't sure what the Council would do with her to make 'non-existence' official and <br />
sweep her under the rug while she was kept with her god father. She felt she was waiting <br />
to be told by death when she was going to die. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marius you okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie turned her head to see the 'other' boys she was walking with. They were a mixed <br />
bunch. All of them including 'Marius' were wearing the standard uniform for children in <br />
the service of the church her age. A leoman cub, a lupman pup, and a lad constantly <br />
hidden in wrappings to cover the majority of his skin, red eyes looking out beneath the <br />
bandages, a dragon hatchling. Like felmans, they made up of about less one percent of the <br />
entire world's population, their history as a horde of raiders, vandals, holding entire town <br />
for ransom, and having been historical partners in crime with the Mongols and Huns had <br />
not helped increase their numbers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... I'm okay Jim... &quot; She said to the leoman cub, whose formal name was Gillian. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't sound it.&quot; The fact their friend hadn't talk about much of how he had lost his <br />
eye one night hadn't helped. <br />
<br />
'Friend? Pst. Friends are honest with each other, I've been lying to them since the day we <br />
met.'  &quot;I've just been a little sick lately, don't worry, it'll pass over soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just be, just be careful okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Careful... why do you think I chose to hang out with those who wouldn't be as easy to <br />
spot a human girl posing as a human boy?' Marie remembered when 'Marius Cruz' had <br />
first met the other Choir Boys, and had wandered over to the non-humans after one lad <br />
had asked a simple off handed question that had nearly blown her cover on day one. <br />
'You've been my friend. Have I really been your friend?'  <br />
<br />
Her father had named her Mary for the Virgin Mary, and Cruz for the Spanish word for <br />
'Cross'  when she had forgotten her own name... was the name Marie any more real than <br />
Marcus? <br />
<br />
&quot;In other word,&quot; The blood wolf Marie in her black and red dress said in the present, &quot;Like <br />
ANY other girl entering puberty, Marie Cruz was struck by questions of self identity.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Penny looked at her book, 'It's not done yet. It's not done yet. I guess deep down I'm glade <br />
I can just live my life with Kirk but I'm not done yet! There are still parts of Penn's life I <br />
need to pen down before I forget him!... Great, now I'm thinking of 'me' as 'him' ... oh well. <br />
You don't get to chose what you are in life. And I volunteered for this entire scheme, I <br />
have even less right to bellyache.' <br />
<br />
Mother Glen had of course had gone over to Mr. P and Gillian. It was a regular reunion <br />
between friends and family.  While Gillian II and Mr. P and Mother Glen continued to catch <br />
up on old times and gently broke to GIllian the many social changes to society in the last <br />
sixty plus years, Penny looked at Amy who in turn was watching the water war that was <br />
now thanks to Tatuli's self sacrifice decided in the pack's favor. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing back here anyway?&quot; Penny asked Amy, &quot;Did the Hokkaido wolves <br />
decide to drop the whole penance business?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry no.&quot; Amy explained, &quot;Yomato and his mates thought it was an acceptable penance. <br />
At first Yomato wanted to serve you -anyway- before he healed, but Akane and the others <br />
managed to convince him that his burdens were their burdens like a marriage should be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glade to hear that. But I figured one of Yamato's mates would be out follow you at <br />
once back here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Logically. But they said they had to a few things to prepare themselves to be in your <br />
service until Yomato heals.&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Such as?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak of the devil, I believe you are about to find out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny then saw the Hokkaido lupman leave the mansion. Her fur was the color of peace <br />
plums. Her chest was double the size of beachballs, and even for a tall female lupman, <br />
that size left her with an almost comical appearance. She was wearing what seemed to be <br />
a black wig done in a bun with chopsticks sticking through the wig. She was also wearing <br />
a brightly colored kimono with a bamboo and leaf pattern colored orange and red with <br />
white trim.  Thankfully it was night and the kimono breathed enough that she was able to <br />
move outside without overheating.  She had a suitcase in her left paw.   It was Umeko. <br />
<br />
The Hokkaido silently came right up to Penny (thankfully not becoming a water target) and <br />
standing between Penny's disabled feet, she got down to her knees, placed her paws <br />
before her and placed her forehead onto the grass, &quot;Mistress Penny. Until My  Yomato <br />
heals so he may serve you until you yourself heal, I am your slave. Command me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy looked insulted, &quot;Kowtowing is a Chinese tradition Umeko not Japanese.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH!&quot; Umeko blushed under her fur and assumed a full kneeling position instead. <br />
<br />
Penny did her best to suppress a groan, the last thing she needed to was upset the apple <br />
cart. &quot;Alright. Umeko... last time we saw each other wasn't under the best circumstances. <br />
And I'm sorry for what I did and I know you are too... right now I'm writing down <br />
something private, you're not to read what I'm writing or written and you're to make sure <br />
I'm not disturbed while writing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Umeko nodded her head, &quot;Yes Mistress Penny.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What's with the suitcase?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am to be your servant during your recovery I must be with you until that time, if <br />
that is acceptable to my mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny suppressed a sigh, &quot;Okay, I'm sure my mom and dad won't mind an extra paw <br />
around the house, and I'll likely be staying with them while I heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Mistress Penny.&quot; Umeko bowed again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Since you now have someone to look after you while Kirk looks after Saba and Paula's <br />
game. I'll be taking a closer look at my brother's adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about your pen and ink well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider them keep sakes until you've finished with them. I have my own. Goodday <br />
Penny-San, Penn.&quot; Amy made her way to the center of the front yard leaving the crab <br />
apple tree behind, the sun-set just about finished and the moon rising and the stars <br />
emerging. <br />
<br />
Umeko looked at the light beige lioness, &quot;What did she mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to know right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress Penny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy saw right now it was Mary, Moja, Nneli, Tano, Sita, and Nane, verses Griselle, <br />
Gretchen, Pence and of course Zelipe. Of course this meant the pups were out numbered.<br />
<br />
Amy looked at her dirty self, &quot;While I need a bath, I think I'd rather not be caught in that <br />
water war like P-Sama was.&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when Amy felt it, looking at the fountain, something was missing from it, <br />
something very important, it took her several seconds to realize what was missing was <br />
herself! How could she not have noticed that before-?! She quickly ran to the fountain and <br />
splashed into the basin past her brother without even a look! <br />
<br />
Amy fell on all fours, and felt a wave of total peace sweep over herself and she felt no <br />
need to move anymore and her size grew greatly and felt something grow out of her back. <br />
<br />
The statue looked like a quadruped adult female wolf made from solid white marble, with <br />
what appeared to be a sun-dial on her back. <br />
<br />
Amy did however notice her brother calling out to her one moment, and then scratching <br />
his head wondering just who he had been calling. Pence pulling him down before he got <br />
squirted. <br />
<br />
Of course Amy realized what that means, 'He... my own brother doesn't remember me?' <br />
Amy thought about the laws of cause and effect,  'But, but how is this even possible-!? If I <br />
wasn't there to destroy Gaal's shade, and if I wasn't there to fight the battle with Kurse-&quot;<br />
<br />
'Don't worry, you still were there.' Said a male voice in her mind. <br />
<br />
She realized the voice had come from one of the identical Japanese Lupman size busted <br />
fountain heads. <br />
<br />
'Who... who are you?'<br />
<br />
'I'm Nelson, or Nessie, take your pick.' The voice shifted tones at the names. <br />
<br />
'Why am I not alarmed, scared, or panicked at being a statue?'<br />
<br />
'Because there's nothing to be scared of.' Said another of the pieces of pipe and marble in <br />
her mind, 'You wanted a ring side seat without being a target, and now you have the best <br />
seat in the house with us! And don't worry, we've already voted that you're free to leave <br />
any moment you chose.' <br />
<br />
'Who, -what- are all of you?'<br />
<br />
The five introduced themselves as the willing living souled gallery of  Alpha-Kaylee, and <br />
that she had NOT ceased to exist. <br />
<br />
'But then why does my brother suddenly not remember me?!'<br />
<br />
Nelson/Nessie chose to be the one to explain things, 'We call it 'perception camouflage'... <br />
those events still happened. It' just people aren't thinking about you, or your role in them, <br />
and don't feel like thinking about how the hole you absence makes in events too hard. It's <br />
not actually a reality shift so much as it's people turning a blind eye to your existence. <br />
After all, who thinks that deep about a statue anymore?'<br />
<br />
'And once I become me again?'<br />
<br />
'You're you now little lady. Only right now you're preserved for posterity.' <br />
<br />
'Point. But what happens?'<br />
<br />
'Everyone goes 'ah right, that's how it really happened' without so much as a thought. It <br />
makes for funny gags too.' Kira injected.<br />
<br />
'I see. So unlike the game, you don't change reality, just people's perceptions of it?'<br />
<br />
Nelson/Nessie explained, 'More or less. Maybe since we're objects reality doesn't mind us <br />
dancing around as much as living creatures. Or maybe as art we don't do much major, <br />
we're free to change roles more. Who can say?' <br />
<br />
'Since reality doesn't feel like it's ready to erase you from the timeline to preserve <br />
consistency, I'd have to concede. So will I be aware of you afterwards?' <br />
<br />
'Maybe, maybe not. We can't really be silent observers if people know we're watching. And <br />
it's not like we're secret police.'  The idea of being spied on didn't really bother Amy, she <br />
was a Lupman after all, and sense of privacy among packmates was pretty much non-<br />
existent. <br />
<br />
Nneli was sneaking around the pups, keeping herself low to the ground and against the <br />
wind. Her plan was simple, sniper her targets and use the statues to her advantage like <br />
Pence and Jay had apparently to mess around with them. <br />
<br />
As Nneli got closer however, as she looked at the fountain, really looked at it, she thought <br />
of the glass art she loved (and hence her interest in Alice and her half-sisters) and looking <br />
at the fountain, wondered how it would look with a lion cub glass sculpture... she <br />
wondered, how it would look with her. But she thought of her sisters, and knew she <br />
couldn't just leave them, she was too important to them to just disappear....<br />
<br />
And as she stood there day dreaming she was drenched by the four remaining lupman <br />
pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there goes Nneli.&quot; Moja observed from their position. <br />
<br />
&quot;Figured she was a bad choice, she always has her head in the clouds,&quot; Sita said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that was me.&quot; Nane injected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same edge, different angle.&quot; Mary said. Most didn't know what she meant and none <br />
bothered to ask where she had heard the phrase from.  <br />
<br />
&quot;NANE! NANE! Can you please come here!&quot;  Called out a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
The prankster cub looked and saw a golden lupman pup waving at her near their <br />
makeshift fortification via a few crab trees. She was alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gretchen!&quot; Nane called out and began to run towards her. <br />
<br />
Tano screamed, &quot;SIS! NO! IT'S-&quot;<br />
<br />
The gold wolf cub took a water tub from who knows where from behind her back and <br />
emptied it's contents at the coming lion cub soaking her utterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Griselle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;False flag operation!&quot; Nane called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't recall either of these armies signing the Geneva Convention, and I didn't say I say I <br />
was my sister you did. And-WHAO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Griselle now ran for it as four squirt guns fired at her and she ran for it getting her tail <br />
soaked but nothing else, and since the cubs had to refill their guns from the hose, the <br />
attack was not continuous. <br />
<br />
Griselle came back to find Pence and Zelipe sitting on her twin on the opposite of the <br />
fountain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi sis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was cheating!&quot; Gretch said from where the boys were using their weight to hold her <br />
down.<br />
<br />
&quot;All fair and love and war.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it isn't!&quot;<br />
<br />
Griselle said, &quot;Pence can you make sure she doesn't try to jump in the basin and out <br />
herself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it.&quot; The jasper colored twin nodded.<br />
<br />
The boys got off her, and she did make a go for the basin, but didn't make it. The boys <br />
also got her out of the way of an accidental squire from the fountain.<br />
<br />
'Maybe we should have that looked at.' Amethyst wondered. <br />
<br />
Omega-Whitney said, &quot;Maybe we should have said something after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amethyst said, &quot;Maybe we should have, but they're just kids. And they didn't -hurt- <br />
Gretchen, so we didn't need to interfere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Omega-Whitney nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;So now we're down to four to four and our number advantage is gone. Great.&quot; Sita <br />
lamented. &quot;Maybe three of us should kamikaze and have Tano stay back while the rest of <br />
us take them down with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That worked because they didn't suspect it. This time they'll know what's up and just start <br />
mowing us down.&quot; Moja explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's getting late.&quot; The ever observant book worm Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't say that!&quot; Sita warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;OKay everyone!&quot; Amethyst called out. &quot;Twenty minutes. Then it's in for dinner and then <br />
goodnight! Greater number of survivors win! IF the numbers are equal, it's a draw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pence and Sita BOTH felt the absolute truth that would NOT accept a -draw!- <br />
<br />
Mary and the quadruplets would normally wonder if they'd be sleeping at the Pack's estate <br />
due to their parents being out of commission for the time being, or if they'd be staying at <br />
the house of another member of the pride for a while, but right now, they had more <br />
important things on their minds. <br />
<br />
The two sides stared at each other, both not wanting to make the first move and leave <br />
themselves vulnerable to an ambush on what had become effectively the enemy's domain. <br />
It was like an invisible force field held the two sides apart as both fell silent at their <br />
nanny's command. Zelipe hated this, he hated fighting and the idea boys were supposed <br />
to like it!  <br />
<br />
Gretchen had lost her taste for this game after her sister had used her to take down Nane. <br />
Pence and Griselle had survived this long, and this close to a win weren't about to give up. <br />
<br />
Mary knew she was a late comer to this game, but she wanted to reach the gold. Moja was <br />
wacking her brain hoping for some kind of solution for some kind of assault that would <br />
give them a superior chance of winning. Sita was itching for something, anything to be in <br />
target range. Tano hoped her sister didn't due anything too reckless! <br />
<br />
Finally several snapped as two words were spoken, &quot;Fifteen minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lioness' did what they did best and charged across the nightly lawn, low to the ground <br />
and only wishing the grass was even taller than it was (the Big Bad pack let their lawn grow <br />
longer than most people's), looking like sharks going through the ocean. <br />
<br />
Gretchen threw down her squirt gun, crossed her arms and sat down. She was the first to <br />
go as the little lionesses hit hard and fast leaving her drenched. <br />
<br />
Griselle not believing her sister took her squirt gun and began firing double shots at the <br />
grass sharks, finally Sita leapt at her determined to push her into the precious basin of <br />
water they had been defending all this time, but Griselle proved size wasn't everything and <br />
let the larger lion girl go her and slash into the basin behind her and out of the game. <br />
<br />
Pence and Griselle stood back to back next to the basin with the three surviving grass <br />
sharks circling. Then came the next click that forced the stalemate to end. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ten minutes!&quot; Whitney called out.<br />
<br />
The grass sharks came from three different directions at once. Tano as fate would have it <br />
was the one along the two's side and realizing they were cornered concentrated all their <br />
fire on her, managing to drench her just as she got close, Miss Amethyst declared &quot;Tano! <br />
Out of the game!&quot; <br />
<br />
Pence and Griselle split hoping to split the grass sharks up too, but they both went after <br />
Griselle, &quot;THis is for the trick with Nane!&quot; Moja declared. <br />
<br />
Griselle screamed and cried for help but Pence just stared helpless as she vanished <br />
underneath the grass and was spat out now soaking wet and clearly out of the game. <br />
<br />
Pence ran, rather foolishly as children will often be, around the fountain, the statues <br />
looking in all direction looking as if grinning at amusement at the sight. Pence ran one <br />
way, Moja ran the same way, and so Mary ran the opposite way. Closing around them like <br />
arms on a clock-face. Pence fired in both directions and barely any hitting, let alone <br />
enough to declared an 'out.' Finally they closed in on him. Pence, not being completely <br />
stupid, dodged out of the way at the last moment, and Mary having the more itchy trigger <br />
finger ended up soaking Moja, and declaring her out of the game. <br />
<br />
Pence breathed a sigh of relief, a very stupid mistake as it gave Mary time to take Moja's <br />
gun and refill it at the basin and soak him to the bone with hers and it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Five minutes!&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when it hit Mary like a thunder bolt. Like three of the pups had stayed put to <br />
defend their precious resource. One had taken off running. <br />
<br />
&quot;One boy against one girl. Shouldn't be too hard.&quot; Mary thought very confidently. <br />
<br />
That was when Zelipe howled, leapt across the fountain, landed on one of the statues, <br />
leapt again, and fired at the startled Mary.... and in a matter of seconds. <br />
<br />
&quot;OUT! WOLF PACK! WINS!&quot; Amethyst declared like a video game announcer, and then began <br />
singing the catchy theme song to the movie remark of Flash Gordon. &quot;And he saved every <br />
one of us!&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when Amy leapt out of the basin, returning to perception and hugged her <br />
brother, ironically getting him wet, but since the game had already been declared over, it <br />
didn't matter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Half-brother,&quot; Amy hugged him, her hidden eyes wet, &quot;let no impose on you what to <br />
think. You will be a truly great man one day!&quot; <br />
<br />
Zelipe was surprised, but nodded.<br />
<br />
Just out of the perception of most, one of the fountain heads then stood up, it's piping <br />
disconnecting, and becoming a flesh and blood red-orange lupman who a more believable <br />
figure. <br />
<br />
'Where ya goin' Michelle?' Thought one of the identical statues, Kira. <br />
<br />
Michelle spoke though no one but the statues really heard her, &quot;Back to the medical wing, I <br />
wanted to provide the cubs and pups with more water spouts to refill for the game and I <br />
did. Now I need to go back to being Julie's good luck totem, it's where I belong.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Whao kay girl. I think I'll stay out here for a while more though, I think afterwards I'll be a <br />
male lupman entry way statue just for the heck of it.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Kira, see you.&quot; She kissed the statue on the forehead.<br />
<br />
'Hey, don't get so silly. We see through each other's senses if we want and hear each <br />
other's thoughts if we want. We're never apart if we want.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, yes I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle walked into the entry way, 'It really does look kinda empty without Kira here.' She <br />
thought and walked into the medical wing, neither lupman nor leoman noticing her. She <br />
then breathed in deep, breathed out slowly, and shrank down into she was the size of a <br />
kitchen nicknack, in a yoga pose and made of inorganic material. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there you are!&quot; Said Julie reaching down and picking up her good-luck totem, &quot;And <br />
just where have you been? Well, back ya go.&quot; She placed her good-luck totem back on the <br />
table, and telling the leomans to be a bit more careful when walking. The tranform of fate <br />
kept Michelle from -ever- being damaged, but Julie didn't know that.  Michelle felt so <br />
happy when Julie held her and placed her back on the table, feeling whole. She'd go back <br />
to the library, eventually, after everyone had healed, but for now, 'This is where I belong.'</p>
