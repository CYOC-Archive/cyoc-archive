<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While telling each other on what you&#39;ve both see yourselves in the mirror&#39;s reflection that you look a bit relieved as the rabbit had told you what his was. After having been turned into a girl twice, aged, de-aged, doggified, and now a kangaroo as his was only being a cute rabbit that you weren&#39;t sure if there is away to find a mirror to turn you both back to the society of humanity. You were probably sixty to fifty-five present kangaroo then being a fully formed kangaroo for his was a seventy to a sixty-five present bunny then a full rabbit that the mirror showed you&#39;re both humanoid, but at least you&#39;re not a girl anymore.<br />
<br />
Jumping off your marsupial head while glimpsimg at the mirrors that you were both going to take what you can, in order to get back a little bit of semblance of your humanity. At first sight as you stare into the mirror for it becomes a bit clearer, the reflection was that of a extremely muscular kangaroo with the upper body so ripped and tough. Male red kangaroos were known for being buff for your arms were long and ripple with bulgeing muscles as your hands were some what large and squared off with roo like claws, instead of having human nails. However, they still shomehow fit fine into blue boxing gloves you carry laced together and thrown over your right shoulder.<br />
<br />
you then raised your head a bit further up when you take notice at what seems to be a  more mature version of yourself for you also see that your human aspect stretches your chest and shoulder girdle wider, so you can have a powerful athlete&#39;s upper body with thick muscle everywhere as your neck and upper back was thick and powerful while showing off every bulging muscle of your body. Even though they aren&#39;t quite the same structure as your former human shape was is where You understood at this very moment that he was most likely to become something similar to what you&#39;re going through while thinking about why you were both to remain like this for some strange mysterious reason, yet this was quite excruciating for you somehow. You preferred to try and stare at your friend who was turning into the same species of his rabbit form as his body looked more human that both of your abdomen was partly human, but his was partly rabbit while yours was also partly kangaroo for you couldn&#39;t stop yourself from seeing more of yourself.<br />
<br />
Rather than a tight narrow six-pack, or even a strong cylindrical shape going out to the powerful kangaroo legs that you now have a muscular cylinder for it was wrapped around from the front to the back as it also went from side to side by almost over-developed muscle. This was a sort of plate of muscle that was leading down to your hips, with back and side muscles to match. With a body like this that you knew it was more than just for show for your legs and tail were still those of a kangaroo, though with a bit more of a humanlike shape around the thighs. the muscles in your back that helped balance your tail were now bigger, and even more sexier.<br />
<br />
you then notice something about yourself for you&#39;ve become extremely aware of your attractiveness. Wait a minute, this was not a thing you remember from being human foryou were shocked, especially frozen by this. well, perhaps if you were still in a girl&#39;s boby, but that was now firmly behind you as you looked over a bit more and see if you missed anything important.<br />
<br />
You try to walk around with your oversize feet for it didn&#39;t work out so well that you decide to hop and bounds a bit on your feet, quickly noticing one thing about yourself as your image in the mirror you&#39;ve saw grows sharper and clearer with detail. you weren&#39;t naked anymore as this was a good thing for you felt relived to know that Your modesty was back to you, and also your friend. Still though, you felt like your modesty was concealed by what feels to be a jock strap with a built-in protective cup, which was probably a good idea at the time that over the top of it was a sort of wrap-on silk or rayon garment as it uses a velcro belt to hold it up in place. it seemed to resemble what basketball and boxing shorts would be, if this boxer had a tail as thier legs for of course you do while it was showing off your bulge abit.<br />
<br />
You had on top of you a long sleeved black hooded sweat shirt, which was probably a good thing at the time since you felt shirtless underneath. The sweater had two rope like strings, like most sweaters at least near the neck caller for the hood as this hood came with two small holes for your large and mobile marsupial kangaroo ears that can hear the distant chaos of the midway outside and also the occasional gasps, grunts, or even surprised bleats of the other former humans who came into the mirror maze here. You weren&#39;t wearing it over your head though for you have short, generally downy fur with longer, blond-red guard hairs that stick up a bit past the fuzz. This also covers your entire body as this was including your face, yet it wasn&#39;t a modified human shape for it was more of a kangaroo&#39;s deer-like.<br />
<br />
However, you had a human-case skull for your human brain as you were looking through larger forward-looking human eyes. Your irises were blue-green as they weren&#39;t your usual brown, but you did remember wearing blue contacts over your eyes when you were human. You&#39;re not wearing any contacts though, but you seem to see fine that you also have a a pair of goggles resting on your forehead as you thought it was probably going to be on when you&#39;re out boxing with someone.<br />
<br />
And yet, there was something about you for you shortly began to look closely at your snout -- it wasn&#39;t quite a muzzle of a kangaroo as it wasn&#39;t quite clearly a human nose ether that it was sure wide enough for it to go all the way down while having a sort of five-sided shape where it meets above the cleft of your lips. Your jaw was now  stronger and wider that it even extends forward out, further than a humans as it gave you a sort of animal-profile. your face was also able to mobile enough for human-ish expressions that when You smiled, Your teeth were strong for you still have your canines you had as a human. perhaps a bit larger even for You seem to clearly be an omnivore.<br />
<br />
You were wearing pads on your knees and around your toes as they match the color of your boxing gloves, even on your elbows that you felt them being underneath your sleeves of the sweat shirt. feeling as though you were done looking at yourself is where you felt like that was the change. At that very moment However, you felt like you need to check out onto your rabbit friend for you look to him and see his similar fate as yours.<br />
<br />
His chances were much like yours as you observed him that his whole skeletal structure changes quite fast to be more human than an animal forhe was allowed to stand on his two legs once more, much like you. Having his arm structure again that like you is where his hands were now some what large and squared off with rabbit like claws, instead of having human nails. Unlike your boxing gloves, his were red and were thrown over his left shoulder for his body was more slinder and fit then yours was.<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t going to asked about his modesty for undergarment, but you didn&#39;t had guess for you see him wearing a tight black spandex shorts with a similar sports bra vest that like yours is where you see his was also a velcro belt to hold his pants up in place as his was too showing off his bulging frount while it was making his butt cheeks look tight on him too. Like with your fur that his was with white fur as his face was more rabbit then human for his forward-looking irises were his usual brown of eyes. His facial expression says it all, especially if he had cute bunny face with his two buck teeth sticking out while wearing similar padding around his elbows, knees, and on his toes that were on his rabbit feet as his size grows slightly taller for he was gaining a few inches of height without growing into a full-grown young adult and accommodate to his newly formed aging process.<br />
<br />
At last, as the feeling of all your former selves being removed and stripped away while being morphed into something else and losing hope of ever turning back to normal that the transformation was now over for he looked up at you pitifully. However, he didn&#39;t seem to be distraught by his unwanted state as you reached out for him and try to ease his pain by cuddling him softly in your stronger arms of a man that you couldn&#39;t help it. With all that has happened here as he sits on his newly formed butt down on your tail, you somehow felt like you indeed enjoyed yourself for a brief moment of your time.<br />
<br />
you weren&#39;t sure about what to think about this place anymore as you were being torn apart by your sudden change of becoming this strange roo person that there was a mix feeling of emotions running inside, yet you somehow felt like taking the time and currently looking after this boxing rabbit person who was now subbing for a bit. After Taking care of him as he soon hopped off your tail, for safety reasons that it was most likely he hates the state he&#39;s in. still remaining silent about this though that Both the of you began to think about what your next step should be while following onto this strange, yet new set of events.</p>
