<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Aw shit! What was I thinkin'&quot;, B reached over to stop the Chronovac. &quot;I need me some liftin' partners, and ya'll two scrawny white asses <br />
just ain't gonna cut it!&quot; He began to type furiously into the Chronovac.<br />
<br />
Colin and Rob didn't like the sound of that.<br />
<br />
Colin had to admit being in a porn star body felt pretty good, but he wasn't sure that turning into a hulking black bodybuilder was <br />
something he wanted. Rob, resigned to the fact that in a few minutes, he'd be some sort of Nubian god, just braced himself for what he <br />
knew was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on just a second,&quot; Colin tried to reason with B. &quot;You're not thinking straight, you're Bryan, a white high school kid, not - <br />
nnnrrgggghhh! Oooooh!&quot; Colin was caught off guard by the beginning of the changes B had keyed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute, bro, and you be thinkin' straight!&quot; B smiled as he watched the changes start.<br />
<br />
Colin had been interrupted by the simultaneous growth of his pecs and ass. The two globes of his butt actually lifting higher on his <br />
frame, while his pecs pushed out into two unbelievable plates of pure muscle. His back widened and piled on muscle while it <br />
compacted, leaving him at a height of 5'6&quot;, though he was still gaining weight. His feet and legs cracked as his legs compressed as well, <br />
and calves like footballs, hard and etched as diamonds grew in. He moaned in ecstasy, fighting the changes turning him into a freak, <br />
but giving in as the pure pleasure of the transformation took hold. His tree-trunk thighs started to grow as his arms, now hanging out <br />
away from his enlarging body due to the impossible thickness of his back, began piling on mass. What little bit of body hair he had <br />
retracted back into his skin, leaving him the perfect complexion for the Mr. Olympia bodybuilder he was fast becoming. &nbsp;Meanwhile, his <br />
arms had finished growing into the 22&quot; pythons that would be his signature in competitions. He stared in wonder at his huge forearms, <br />
seeing the veins snaking their way up and out of his sight. He touched one tentatively, not believing that this could be his body.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The next wave caught Colin by surprise as his dick swelled and lowered. Pure pleasure ran through him as a foreskin grew back over <br />
his member and his balls dropped to accommodate his new manhood. He may have been a porn star before, but he was most <br />
definitely king of them now. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
While he was trying to see over his pecs, a tough task in his current form, he noticed his field of vision change. Colin couldn't tell, but B <br />
grinned as Colin's features started showing their soon to be African heritage. His head began widening slightly as his cheekbones rose <br />
to prominence. All the while his bald head began to round off, almost like B's - the two began to resemble each other, like they may be <br />
brothers, or possibly cousins. Colin's nose flared and flattened against his face. Combined with the strong jaw he developed, he had a <br />
very commanding visage, even with the expression of ecstasy and confusion it was now displaying. As Colin's eyebrows arched higher <br />
giving him the look of a model, B thought to himself, &quot;jus' one thing left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin was still reeling from the changes and power he now felt. He was just coming to terms with his new muscle when he looked down <br />
and noticed he was getting tanner. A lot tanner. He shot a look over to B as his skin darkened into the color of deep milk chocolate, the <br />
shade he'd be from now on. &nbsp;To seal his identity as an award winning bodybuilder, a pair of dark red posing trunks appeared on him, <br />
accentuating the curves of his improved physique. The distended pouch bulged obscenely with Colin's huge endowment. The sensation <br />
of the silk against his dick was almost too much as the python encased in the pouch started to stir sending waves of bliss to it's new <br />
owner.<br />
<br />
Assuming the changes were finished Colin shouted out to B, &quot;What da fuck you do ta me, son?!&quot;. He stood wide-eyed in surprise. The <br />
voice and vocabulary weren't his. His voice was deep and smooth, like a Barry White impersonator. And his speech had noticeable <br />
&quot;hood&quot; inflections in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last bit of changes,&quot; was all B said.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;What da fuck?! I didn't want to change race! I didn't want to be no bodybuilder! You turned me into a-&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin didn't get to finish as his mind changed. Instantly, he got information on working out, nutrition, which gyms were the best, posing <br />
and competing with the new pro bodybuilder body he had. He also got information on his new race. The history, the heritage, the sense <br />
of community. He looked over to B and felt a new connection, a new sense of brotherhood.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
He was conflicted for a moment. He still remembered and knew he was a white, gangly, high school student. But he wasn't. &nbsp;He looked <br />
down at himself. &nbsp;The only thing hinting what Colin once was were his piercing hazel eyes. &nbsp;He was a huge hulking black bodybuilder, <br />
and B was his workout partner. He had to admit, he liked being this better than a white high school student. The muscles felt so <br />
incredible, the blood pumping through them giving him a natural high. His new racial identity gave him a sense of belonging he never <br />
had known before. And anyway the changes were permanent - and the memory of his old life seemed like a dream. &nbsp;As he accepted his <br />
new identity as Cedric, or Ced as all his bro's called him, his bookbag that had been tossed in the corner of the room shimmered and <br />
changed into a gym bag, completely stocked for the bodybuilder he had become.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, I'm not sure whatcha did to me, but thanks!&quot;, Ced shook his head to get the cobwebs out as his new identity settled in. He looked <br />
over at B and began posing for the first time.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Even though he was &quot;Ced&quot; now, Colin was still in there, and posing was a whole new experience for him. He couldn't believe the power <br />
he felt, or the fact that this was his body. Each pose flexed muscles he'd never had - he'd seen the huge musclemen in the magazines, <br />
and wondered what being that big would feel like, but he never imagined it would feel this powerful. It all felt strange, but good, and <br />
natural. He couldn't wait to get up on a stage as his new career identity kicked in.<br />
<br />
Smiling, B joined in the impromptu pose-off.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rob had been going through his own changes.</p>
