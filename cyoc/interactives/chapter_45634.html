<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sandra was nude!<br />
<br />
Well topless anyway.  On closer inspection Bobby could actually see some fabric that clung to the girl's shoulders and wrapped around the back.  The cloth, probably cotton, also ran under her magnificent breasts and hung loosely around her stomach.  Her modesty was saved only by her careful palming of her breasts.  Hands and fingers covering her nipples but little else of her breasts.  When he focused, Bobby could make himself see her as she was with bared breasts free to be perky to the air with no support but her hands.  But if he let his mind drift to something else his mind seemed to tell him that she was as covered and unremarkable as himself.  It was an odd feeling to be bothered by her nudity and to not even noticed it at the same time.  Below the waist she wore a kicky jean skirt that showed of her new shapely legs, right down to her heeled sneakers and fluffy tube socks.  When his eyes eventually came back to her face she had stopped smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, even you notice, huh?&quot;  She said in a defeated tone.  &quot;I thought that someone else that had been at the prom would be immune to what Loki did.  I guess not, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, what did he do?&quot;  Bobby said trying very hard to not look at the great cleavage she was presenting to him on two seemingly minuscule hands.  Soft white hands that seemed entirely too small to be on a lovely girl with such large tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you do notice that I am not really wearing a top, right?&quot;  Sandra was starting to grin again.  Bobby's discomfort seemed to imply that he really was trying to not look at her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, yeah, sort of.  Well, you do have that bit over your shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you believe that it was a t-shirt when I put it on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what happened to the front of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Loki made it so that no matter what top, bra, or shirt that I wear, it will sort of 'slide' off my breasts revealing them to the world.&quot;  Sandra said this with a careful mix of fear, hatred and incredulousness that the situation warranted.<br />
<br />
Bobby remained silent for a moment.  Given the number of students in the graduating class and the creativity of Loki, Bobby reckoned that all over town there were people telling these same stories.  Short sound-bites of explanation that would quickly convey what could only be a new way of life.  Secretly he wished that somewhere someone was chronicling their misery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do people notice?  I mean, like, other people?&quot;  Bobby said.  He knew it sounded stupid; 'other people' were not like the class.  But somehow, Sandra and Bobby were part of a select group.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't think that people would notice a busty girl with her tits out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, they don't seem to notice.  As long as I keep my nips covered people just seem to think I show a lot of cleavage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  That's good.  I guess Loki doesn't want to draw too much attention to what he does.  But you must get a little tired having to cover up like that all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's more than that,&quot; Sandra said moving in closer so she could whisper.  &quot;If people can see my nipples then something strange happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby was going to say something supportive but the way she was standing was just too much for him.  Leaning forward a little her breasts all but spilled over her hands.  It was like she was trying to hold two soft, balloons filled with gelatin.  They quivered and blushed a little.  He was immediately reminded of Colleen in his bed yesterday.  Bobby felt his dick push down his pant leg and he squirmed to get it into a more comfortable position.  For a moment he forgot why he was so afraid to get aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I don't keep covered,&quot; Sandra said, &quot;then people get too focused on my tits.  Just them looking causes my nipple to feel like they're being played with.  The longer it lasts the better it gets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Bobby said.  The way she talked he wanted her to go on.  His hand was absentmindedly trying to loosen the pressure in his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  It's really annoying.  Like, kissing and nibbling and licking and flicking.&quot;  Her hands were now doing more than just covering her breasts.  Moving slowly in small circles her breasts were being mushed together and around.  Sandra was also rubbing her thighs against each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you be willing to show me?&quot;  Bobby said, his mouth working almost on its own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she said biting her lip and grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got my own secret, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Do you want to know what it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra laughed her little laugh once again.  But before she could answer a door down the changing hall opened.  Sandra turned quickly and skipped off to the front of the store just as Colleen came into view.  She was so focused on the items in her hands to notice anything untoward.  Bobby played as if nothing had happened.  His erection ebbed slowly but Colleen did not seem to be effected enough to notice.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Colleen was purchasing a set of new bras.  Sandra was doing her best to ring up the sale and bag the items with one free hand and the other pressed across both her nipples.  As they left Bobby looked back and found Sandra smiling at him.  Lingering a moment longer he saw her wave goodbye with both hands and her free nipples suddenly drew his eyes.  It was hard but he managed to refocus on her face.  Sandra's face now a picture of bliss stayed with him as he left almost walking into a glass wall.  As his penis once again stiffened he wondered if he would ever get to see her again.<br />
<br />
Smiling himself, Bobby caught up to Colleen and grabbed her bag to carry it for her.  &quot;Where to next?&quot;</p>
