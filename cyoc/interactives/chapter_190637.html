<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom was nothing exceptional. He had average looks, short brown hair and was of average stature. He wasn&#39;t particularily eyecatching but also not ugly in any way or form. He usually scored just average in sports and his grades were also run of the mill. He was nothing short of content with the state of things. Except for one thing.<br />
<br />
You see, his mother was very attached to him. Usually this was no big problem, after all he loved his mom just as match, if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that the schools gossipy girl clique catched onto the fact. After that his school life has been turned into a myriad of annoyances.<br />
<br />
Whoppee cushions placed on his seat, embarrassing photos of him and his mom placed in his locker to fly out, stolen gym clothes, the words &quot;mama&#39;s boy&quot; with hearts around scribbled all over his desk...<br />
<br />
And of course the smug leader of that girl clique, Sophia harrasing him at every opportunity. She was anything but average compared to him. She had a large and ample chest and rear, and a beatiful face, topped off with beautifully styled long blonde hair and shining blue eyes. If not for her atrocious personality and poor performance in school, she would have been every guys dream in town.<br />
<br />
However, despite all this, there were two things exceptional about Tom, his iron will and unshakeable pride. Despite all the bullying, he is waiting and planning to get his revenge and restore his honour.<br />
<br />
As such, today it seems his determination will finally pay off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Tommy, a package has arrived for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hesistantly Tom answered<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect any delivery mum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s odd. Maybe it&#39;s something important, I&#39;ll put it down right in front of your door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, thanks mum&quot;<br />
<br />
After finishing the session in his favourite videogame, Tom stands up and takes the package into his room.<br />
<br />
Examining it, there is no sender to be found. Nothing on it indicates what it could contain or which person or service sent it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... Hopefully it isn&#39;t one of those bitches prank again. It could be something like a glitter bomb. I better make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom put some paper sheets on the ground around the package and put on some old clothes, just to make the clean-up easier in case he was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well here goes nothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom took his side cutter to cut through the tape, careful to not damage the insides.<br />
<br />
What was inside wasn&#39;t what he expected at all. Inside was a suspicious blue box, with some Japanese characters written on it, with the translation below: &#39;Pervert Stickers&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom turned the box upside down looking for any clues on what it contains, but except for the title on top there weren&#39;t any indicators. Not were it was produced, not who it was manufactured by, nothing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here goes nothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom slowly lifted the top of the box, revealing whats inside. On top there was a what seemed to be small manual with some instructions:<br />
<br />
&#39;These stickers will make what&#39;s depicted on them grow on whatever surface they are stuck on. Now with unlimited lasting glue and unlimited stickers! Portable version included -<br />
<br />
Can also be applied on humans. Results depend on location and stickers can be combined as creatively as you wish.<br />
<br />
Notice: Stickers can only be removed by who placed them. In case of that being a deceased person, a hotline number will appear below:<br />
<br />
-blank-<br />
<br />
Rules:<br />
1. Have fun!&#39;<br />
<br />
Tom looked into the box and recoiled in suprise. Inside there were 5 rows of different sticker types, depicting dicks, breasts, asses, pussies and lips of varying sizes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This must be a prank!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked around his room frantically in case there was a camera, and inspected the window frame to see if there were signs of an intruder placing such a cam. However nothing seemed out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
There is no way this is real... or is there? (insert you know what music)<br />
<br />
Tom looked back at the box. Each sticker type had a whole stack and they were all placed neatly on top of each other, despite him shakimg the box around earlier. Intrigued, Tom took a human pussy sticker, disgusted at the horse option, and looked at it with a blush. No way, right?<br />
<br />
He placed the sticker on a small wooden cube had as decoration and see, right there on the sticker appeared a neat human pussy. No way...<br />
<br />
Tom touched it with his finger, shocked at the warmth it was emitting, not only that, it reacted to his touch, quivering slightly, juices slightly moistening the outside of the lips. Congused and aroused, Tom used his fingers to slightly spread the lips to see inside. Despite the cubes size, the pussy had the full insides, reaching way deeper than physically possible with the cubes size.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Tom tore off the sticker and held it in his hand. He wasn&#39;t tripping, right? No, no, he never did any drugs. Besides, he would have noticed if he was under some influence. And this all felt very much real...<br />
<br />
Rom peered over to the box again. The pussy sticker stack was just as big as before he took one. He placed the sticker back and it seemingly placed itself perfectly back without the stacks size increasing at all.<br />
<br />
Tom thought to himself... I wonder how...<br />
<br />
Tom took a breast sticker with the size indication A and took off his shirt. Don&#39;t wanna go overborad after all. He placed the sticker on his chest, right in the middle and suddenly the sticker shifted to nearly perfectly match his skin tone. Quickly, all his chest hair receded, leaving him completely devoid of it and he could feel his chest becoming more sensitive. His nipples lightened in shade and became more girly, increasing in size. Soon after, his chest formed slight mounds, now possessing proper female fat tissue.<br />
<br />
He looked in the mirror. The cute small breasts looked completely off on the high schooler, yet he couldn&#39;t help but get slightly aroused at the sight. He carefully coordinated his right hand to one of the nipples, touching it. He blushed at the sensation, realizing how much more sensitive they had become. <br />
<br />
After prodding at the tissue for a while, he snapped back to reality and carefully took off the sticker. Suprisingly the glue didn&#39;t hurt and there was no ripping. He placed the sticker back into the box as his girly breasts turned back into his regular old male chest.<br />
<br />
He looked at the corner to see a small dispenser lying in the box. It was also blue and has two indicators on it with two slits, one labaled as entry, the other as exit. Tom picked it up and wondered how it worked. He thought back to the boob sticker and see, one came out of the device for him to take. Simple, yet effective. <br />
<br />
Tom put the lid back on the box and placed it in his drawer, keeping the handheld stickers dispenser. A darkened grin appeared across his face. Finally he could have his revenge. But how will he do it?</p>
