<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie reached out and grabbed the amulet as it was thrown. He didn't <br />
believe anything would happen, but it was thrown in his direction.<br />
<br />
He had other things to think about. His wonderful wife was under a lot <br />
of pressure from her father to divorce Charlie. At 22, Charlie was a <br />
mechanic and his father-in-law was a powerful, wealthy, successful <br />
corporate executive. He despised Charlie and didn't like having to <br />
give them money all the time.<br />
<br />
Charlie enjoyed the extra money and the gifts, but he didn't like his <br />
father-in-law's arrogant attitude and his contempt for him. <br />
<br />
They were meeting the next morning for breakfast at Starbucks. Charlie <br />
knew he was going to try to force Charlie to leave his daughter.<br />
<br />
As he was leaving, he thought &quot;If this amulet really works, I have an <br />
idea&quot;<br />
<br />
The next morning, Charlie arrived in his jeans and tee shirt.<br />
<br />
Edmund Parker, his father-in-law, arrived in his navy blue three <br />
piece, pinstriped business suit, silk tie, starched white shirt and <br />
highly polished shoes, carrying a briefcase.<br />
<br />
Charlie held the amulet and said: &quot;I want to control my father-in-law <br />
- I want him to obey whatever I say&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Charlie&quot; said Mr. Parker in a sharp tone. &quot;I'm glad to see you <br />
are on time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It didn't work&quot; thought Charlie. &quot;I should have known&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will get right to the point&quot; continued Mr. Parker in his commanding <br />
tone. &quot;You seem like a decent young man but you know I have never <br />
approved of your marriage to my daughter. Do you understand why? I see <br />
no financial future for you as a mechanic. You have no ambition, no <br />
drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Charlie looked hard at his father-in-law.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to listen to me!&quot; he said and stared at him.<br />
<br />
Mr. Parker looked shocked and then angry - and then his clear blue <br />
eyes lost their focus.<br />
<br />
He struggled with himself and then said in a quiet voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am listening&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlie felt a thrill of excitement and control.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now you will obey me - whatever I tell you and whatever I want, <br />
you will obey. You may not like it. You may resist. But you will obey! <br />
And you call me SIR from now on - and I call you Eddie whenever we are <br />
alone. Got it?&quot; said Charlie boldly, staring into his father-in-law's <br />
frightened eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes I...understand....&quot; said Mr. Parker slowly, feeling the <br />
impossibility of resisting. <br />
<br />
&quot;YES WHAT?&quot; snapped Charlie<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...sir&quot; said Mr. Parker grudgingly. He didn't know why he suddenly <br />
had to obey, but he did...<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we need to test your obedience&quot; said Charlie. He looked over <br />
his Father-in-law. At 54, Edmund Parker was a tall, lean, imposing <br />
man. Charlie was always intimidated by him. He was so perfect. <br />
<br />
It was time to make some changes.<br />
<br />
“I…I have a conference at 11 today. I should be getting back…” said <br />
Edmund Parker nervously. He didn’t understand what had happened and <br />
wanted to get away.<br />
<br />
“Not yet Eddie!” said Charlie. He looked at his father-in-law’s <br />
perfect head of thick silver hair. “Time for you to get a haircut!. <br />
You got TWO HOURS!”<br />
<br />
“But, sir – I – I don’t need. I don’t WANT a haircut. I have a stylist <br />
that…” Edmund Parker stuttered and pleaded. But his son-in-law was now <br />
in control.<br />
<br />
Charlie knew his father-in-law was proud and vain about his hair. He <br />
had a full head of hair, carefully groomed and neatly parted, when <br />
many men were losing theirs and since his divorce many women <br />
complimented him and called him a Silver Fox. He spent plenty to keep <br />
it perfect. It was part of his perfect image. <br />
<br />
So Charlie decided it had to be changed. NOW<br />
<br />
“No choice, Eddie! I said it’s time for a HAIRUCT!” said Charlie. “And <br />
no fancy stylist for you now!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir” whispered Edmund Parker.<br />
<br />
Together they left the coffee shop and walked through the city, and <br />
Charlie led his well-dressed executive father-in-law to a low income <br />
neighborhood.<br />
<br />
People stared at the tall man in the three piece suit and briefcase. <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” said Edmund Parker to his son-in-law. “Where are <br />
you taking me?” Here he was, a powerful, wealthy 54 year old executive <br />
being led by his slacker son in law through dirty streets and there <br />
was nothing he could do to stop it.<br />
<br />
Charlie smiled and opened the door to a tiny, dusty, dark shop.  <br />
Edmund Parker looked in and Charlie pulled him inside.<br />
<br />
There were three barber chairs with three very old barbers, with two <br />
customers – both men in overalls.  Cigar smoke filled the shop. <br />
<br />
They all stared at the man in the business suit and the polished <br />
shoes.<br />
<br />
Charlie said “My father-in-law here wants a whole new haircut. <br />
Something really different”<br />
<br />
The oldest barber grinned, grabbed Mr. Parker by his pinstriped arm <br />
and propelled him into the one empty chair. He pulled a huge, dirty <br />
barber cape over him – covering his suit.<br />
<br />
Charlie leaned over and whispered to his father-in-law:<br />
<br />
“Eddie, tell him to shave your head completely. BALD. Every hair. I <br />
want you to be a cueball. Tell him you want a new image”<br />
<br />
“BALD!! NO PLEASE” Edmund Parker was horrified. But he had no choice. <br />
He had to obey Charlie.<br />
<br />
“What’ll it be sir?!” said the barber. “What kind I do for you? A <br />
trim? That’s a FINE head of hair you got there! I wouldn’t mind having <br />
it myself! Bet you’re REAL proud of it!”<br />
<br />
Edmund Parker took a deep breath. “Yes – I…I am….but I want you to <br />
shave it all off”<br />
<br />
The barber was stunned. “SHAVE YOU BALD?!”<br />
<br />
“Yes” said Edmund Parker. “Shave it off. Every hair. Completely bald. <br />
I…I want a new image”<br />
<br />
All three barbers and the customers laughed.<br />
<br />
“Shave off all that hair!? OK – You’re in charge…” said the barber.<br />
<br />
Edmund Parker closed his eyes. He couldn’t bear to watch.<br />
<br />
“No – I’m in charge” whispered Charlie to his father-in-law as the <br />
barber put the clippers to his forehead and began to push them through <br />
the curtain of silver hair. Four inches of hair fell slowly in sheets <br />
and tufts to the floor. The executive watched as all the hair on his <br />
head was cut off. Then the barber changed blades and shaved off every <br />
bit of stubble.<br />
<br />
Charlie’s father-in-law’s beautiful head of hair was gone.<br />
<br />
Edmund Parker opened his eyes and stared in horror. He was BALD. “I <br />
have no hair” he gasped.<br />
<br />
“That’s right pal – no hair at all!” said the barber, shaking his <br />
head. “I can’t say you look better because you don’t! I’ll shine it up <br />
for you!”<br />
<br />
The barber rubbed lotion into his naked scalp and lifted the cape.	<br />
<br />
A stunned Edmund Parker stood up, paid the barber and walked out with <br />
Charlie.<br />
<br />
“I am bald. I am bald” repeated Edmund Parker, over and over. “My hair <br />
is gone. But at least it will grow back” he whispered. “I will wait <br />
for it every day”<br />
<br />
Charlie grabbed his tall father-in-law and looked up in his face. “NO <br />
YOU WON’T! You will STAY bald! I don’t want to see ONE hair on your <br />
head! Keep it shaved! No more silver fox!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Parker begged and pleaded but finally nodded sadly. “I must stay <br />
bald. No more silver fox. I am now a bald man”<br />
<br />
Charlie’s father-in-law was learning obedience.</p>
