<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad felt something warm lips caressing his anus, as his body seemed to swell all over. He felt his cock and balls inside him moving. He was disoriented.  He remembered being in the locker room, and eating something that Rick had given him as a peace offering after pranking him. He had been pranked again!  He was going to Bruno&#39;s party as a sex doll. Everyone would recognize him, but Rod or Rick said that 5 or 6 loads would make him look generic. So Rod, Rick and Ty had fucked him. All three at once. He wasn&#39;t sure how, but he was sure they did. After the 3rd or 4th load, Chad couldn&#39;t remember clearly. Maybe he would later, but he wasn&#39;t sure. He was lying on a bed. If the sheets hadn&#39;t been blue and the football helmet on the nightstand by Chad&#39;s head, he might have thought he was in Karen Sinclair&#39;s bed getting a rim job. He had been in Rick&#39;s bedroom before, and this didn&#39;t look like it. Maybe he was in Rod&#39;s room, he thought hopefully.  <br />
<br />
Chad knew he should be angry with Rick, but he could not be angry. He should have been angry with Rick, and Ty for using him, but he was a sex doll now. They only did with him what he would have done if he was human and they were sex dolls, right?<br />
<br />
Plop, his cock and balls popped out, and got harder and harder, as Rod blew hot air into Chad&#39;s air valve. Rod took another breath, blew again, breathed in, blew out, again and again. Rod held the valve shut, and tested Chad&#39;s taut rubber buns. He nodded, and smiled. He took a deep breath and exhaled into the sex doll.  Then he sealed the valve, and pushed the valve  part way between Chad&#39;s buns. Then Rod jerked off until he was rock hard, and then he plunged his cock into Chad&#39;s anus to push the valve deep inside Chad.<br />
<br />
Chad was elated. He was a sex doll now. It was good to be used.  He wanted to be used even more. He needed to be used. Rod blew his load. Chad felt whole.  He was owned. Things need to be owned. He was a thing. He was a sex doll.<br />
<br />
Rod pulled out. No cum leaked out. It was just like Rick said, Chad was a self-cleaning sex doll. He chuckled.  He strutted over to his desk, and found a permanent white marker. Then he grabbed one of Chad&#39;s legs and printed with the white marker on Chad&#39;s blue rubber skin, &quot;ROD&quot; and then he grabbed the other foot,  and wrote in smaller letters, &quot;TOULEMANN&quot;. <br />
<br />
Chad could sense the letters being written on his feet burning into his soul. It was like in Toy Story, only Rod Toulemann owned Chad.<br />
<br />
Next he felt a cardboard stencil on his back, and the pen filled in his jersey number 23.  He was 23, the QB, the MVP, he was Rod Toulemann&#39;s sex doll. This was Chad&#39;s reality now.<br />
<br />
Rod flipped Chad over, and got a face full of dick and cursed. He&#39;d have to do something about that. He flicked Chad&#39;s penis, and smiled. Rick didn&#39;t think Chad would remember being a doll- at least not clearly. Rod squeezed it. He wondered what it would be like to ride it? It was only fair, right? And Chad wouldn&#39;t remember anyway.<br />
<br />
Rod had fantasized about his teammate before, but nothing serious, at least until Chad became a jockstrap.  Since he&#39;d worn Chad, he&#39;d been obsessed with Chad.  When Rick canned Chad, Rod had sprayed himself thoroughly with Chad&#39;s essence. Instead of satisfying his obsession though, it intensified.  He had to have Chad. He just had to have it- uh, it&#39;s a him still. Or is it? <br />
<br />
Rod lay his erection on top of balloon boy&#39;s inflated cock. He wasn&#39;t sure exactly when he stopped thinking of the sexdoll as Chad, and started thinking of it as Balloon Boy, but he had. Chad&#39;s penis was still bigger, even though Rod had easily 60 lbs on human Chad,  and like 235 or 240 lbs on Balloon Boy who couldn&#39;t weigh more than 5 lbs now. <br />
<br />
Rod straddled Chad&#39;s  legs, then positioned Balloon Boy&#39;s cock on Rod&#39;s own rosebud. Then he sat down on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeow!&quot; Rod yelped,  and blew a load of cum across Balloon Boy&#39;s chest and face.  Rod watched as the white goo seemed to vanish as the rubber skin absorbed it. No residue remained, and Chad&#39;s facial features and pecs became less distinct.  <br />
<br />
Rod glanced over at the antidote sitting on his bookshelf.  Yeah, Balloon Boy would probably  get a couple hundred loads at Bruno&#39;s.  But it was Spring Break, and Rod&#39;s family was already down in Miami. Rod would join them in a couple days, with Balloon Boy stowed safely in his luggage. After 1000 or more loads from drunk kids on Miami&#39;s beaches, what of Chad would remain, if Rod used the antidote? <br />
<br />
Rod looked down at Baloon Boy&#39;s shiny blue penis. Not a drop of his shit remained.  Chad was totally self cleaning.  Rod picked up the pen, and wrote MVP on the doll&#39;s penis&#39; mushroom tip..<br />
<br />
&quot;MVP?&quot; Rod remarked, &quot;Most Valuable Player? Not any more, Balloon Boy,  you&#39;ve been played. Most Valuable Penis? Maybe? MVP, hm?&quot;  Then Rod grabbed the penis with his fist, and rammed it deep into Chad. Rod smiled, &quot;I think MVP standa for most valuable pussy, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad sobbed from the pain. MVP burned deep into his being. It reminded him of what he had been Most Valuable Player,  and of what he now was Most Valuable Pussy. It was good to be Valuable. <br />
<br />
Rod pulled his hand out of Chad&#39;s new pussy, and plunged his cock in.  Rod fucked Chad&#39;s new pussy until Rod fell asleep with his boner inside.  Chad felt the connection to Rod.  While Rod slept Balloon Boy formerly known as Chad couldn&#39;t sleep. Apparently,  sex dolls don&#39;t sleep. Chad couldn&#39;t move, or speak, but he was totally aware. Rod&#39;s thoughts betrayed his plans to Chad. Balloon Boy thought Miami sounded exciting. The pool party would be fucking fun, but Spring Break Miami promised he&#39;d be totally used. Rod was so good to it.</p>
