<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex decided to embrace the perversion of this world, keeping his name and settling on the Pink Mage build. Half-Angel was, strangely, a green category, so inspecting it he found that one could be a hybrid of various celestial beings with obscure names and rankings. He guessed angels weren&#39;t so simple around here. Deciding to randomize by category on race and randomize the remaining stats and occupation, Alex entered the next phase of character creation.<br />
<br />
ROLLING FOR ANGELIC SUBTYPE...THRONE<br />
ROLLING FOR OCCUPATION...GENDALFINE<br />
ROLLING FOR STATS SYSTEM...CATEGORICAL, 10/20 STAGE AVG<br />
STR: HUMAN, 10<br />
DEX: HUMAN, 10 (CONDITIONAL: POSTHUMAN, 12)<br />
CON: POSTHUMAN, 12<br />
INT: HUMAN, 18 (CONDITIONAL: POSTHUMAN, 12)<br />
WIS: HUMAN, 16 (CONDITIONAL: POSTHUMAN, 12)<br />
CHA: HUMAN, 18 (CONDITIONAL: POSTHUMAN, 12)<br />
<br />
Information hit Alex like a brick, in that it quite literally knocked him out from a blow to the head and when he woke up he had it. He was now Alex Guy, spawn of Throne 42 Aegis of Lawbreakers&#39; Restoration and Some Guy, a priest-summoner of the Ordering One, knightgod of Meljin. He was...surprisingly similar to how he was in his previous life, though with some details added on. 18 year old, piercing blue eyes (now speckled with some weird stardust effect, but whatever), short brown hair that merged into his 5’o clock shadow, generic caucasian overall look, about 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; height, mild body hair, a cock of about 3 inches soft and 6 hard...the other add-ons were more notable. His spirit condensed itself into something both physical and immaterial, between that of a ghost and an immortal being that most of the time hid in his body but could wander about a good distance and orbit him like a half-ghost&#39;s separated soul body (weird that he knew what that was), taking the form of a bluish-auraed white blob with a halo of firey eyes he could see out of (freaky, let&#39;s let those eyes rest for now then, maaaybe keep the soul inside the body where it won&#39;t bump into things).<br />
<br />
Passive Skill: Native Faith: You can fly at will unpropelled, and flashstep.<br />
Passive Skill: Loosely Souled: Your soul can wander out of your physical body and influence the physical world, but it takes effort to bring beyond a given range while alive.<br />
Pink Mage Skill: Dicks Are Wands Too: Pink Mages use their dicks as magic wands to affect the world around them. Masturbation acts as a sort of nudging influence, guiding others&#39; thoughts, telekinetically moving things, or shifting the finer details of proximity reality gently if concentrated on doing something. Pissing is brute force conjuration, materializing desired things in larger quantity than made sense for the volume, or transmuting and transforming things at will. Precum and cum are used to cast more complex or specific spells, with pleasure and pain both enhancing them (especially the force of orgasm). Fucking oneself is useful for becoming a more powerful mage quickly, with the mightiest casting world-rewriting spells and opening supposedly-unbreakable seals simply by plowing themselves repeatedly in ritual circles and such. Sigil-based spellcasting and such is possible by drawing symbols and imbuing them with energy and meaning (magical or otherwise), though it is hard to actually imbue that energy without special tools or using a magically unleashed part. Pink mages can control their genitalia remotely, able to change size and shape at will, detach and reattach it (along with other body parts), and direct it telekinetically. Unlocking potential in other parts is strenuous without demons, prolonged ritual, or excessive self-love, and only the latter is pretty much guaranteed to be safe. But it&#39;s a sex world, your genitals are enough, right?<br />
<br />
The not-capslocked declaration of other gameplay-centric features brought Alex back to his new reality: he was some free-roaming magic-cocked dude in a village, with the occupation of &#39;supporting adventurers however he deemed fit&#39;. Whether that was being a mysterious sexually-powered healer and upgraded tool provider, or just fucking all the enemies to open the way, he could probably do it all and change the world with some setup rituals or whatever. What DID he have set up, anyway? Alex looked down, revealing that he was wearing a simple beige tunic over brown trousers with an adventurer&#39;s bag and sensible black boots.  Underneath those trousers, he had a butt plug with a cleansing enchantment that kept his whole body clean and free of waste (&#39;convenient for adventure!&#39; the dad that Alex had in this world but conveniently was not beholden to had told him in the retroactive history) and his hole in particular loose enough to fuck while still fairly tight. He could still piss if he wanted to for a cheap conjuration spell, but otherwise he didn&#39;t really need to deal with those bodily functions as per usual RPG fashion. Mildly amazing, though strangely normal. Sleep, food, drink, and even breathing were recommended for bonuses, but were optional due to his race. Alex noticed he was floating like a dream slightly above the cobblestone-and-dirt village main path, a feeling that was strangely natural and practiced to him.<br />
<br />
Half-angel or not, the human want for lust had apparently been inherited from Some Guy, and compounded upon Alex&#39;s arousal from character generation. Even realizing that in most parts of the world public indecency wasn&#39;t a problem, Alex sheepishly floated into a relatively quiet-looking alleyway between two shops and stuck a hand into his pants. This caused him to blink repeatedly as beginning to masturbate heightened his magic-sense (and at that the sense of the fluidity of reality: that he could retcon someone&#39;s history just by wanking hard enough with a goal in mind caused him to put aside the thought beyond &#39;let&#39;s not do that just yet&#39;). Exposed to the new feeling of many magical signatures in the area (the details of his own very bright), his soul-self jostled out of the center of his body like a ghost, exciting his cock as it flew forward and slightly down, phasing through his clothes but forming a ghostly aftercurrent.  Memories of a life not lived flooding back into him, Alex realized...he could fuck himself this way. A lot. Youthful exploration of a detached cock, forming the mythological &#39;pussy&#39; hole to be fucked in a new spot by it, masturbating with his very ghost...apparently, a Pink Mage&#39;s sexual stamina for hundreds of orgasms a day was difficult to exhaust without a literal army, and their lust usually didn&#39;t fall far behind or they wouldn&#39;t have gone for the class, world-shaping power or not. Tail-trail twisting around his shaft for a few experimental tugs on the way back, Alex&#39;s soul returned to immaterial within-body status with an even more raging boner. Pulling his clothes aside for the easy access they were designed for, Alex breathed deeply and clenched on his plug as he came for what was the first of likely many times that day alone. Magical potential surged within Alex&#39;s mind, rapidly transmuting the cum into the floaty blue energies of a divination spell, with which he scried for the village&#39;s meetup spots, which turned out to be &#39;yeah dude it&#39;s pretty much everywhere&#39;. He could bang in the inn&#39;s tavern or bedrooms, bang in the bathhouses, jerk off in the streets...the sheer possibility was massively tempting, but it could wait.<br />
<br />
Some voyeurism of the guys to adapt Alex&#39;s isekai&#39;d mind to the much more lenient sexual standards of this world struck him as a great idea. They apparently might even appreciate the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, you&#39;re a Pink Mage? Hot.&quot; a male voice suddenly said, causing Alex to instinctively pull up his pants and turn around.<br />
It was a man in an anachronistic green-sleeved white T-shirt labeled &#39;LORD LUCK&#39; with some stylized clover around it, some short shorts, simple green shoes, and a leprechaun-style green hat on red hair, and emerald eyes more piercing than the azure of Alex&#39;s own. He was shorter than Alex, and skinnier too, but incredibly smug. &quot;Sup bro, check your passives. I&#39;m the guy it&#39;s talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cursed Hero. Level up quickly, but luck is not your friend and evil will be attracted to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got that?&quot; he said. &quot;I know you do. I know everything about you, from Lord Meljin&#39;s fetishes to your retroactive daddies and an Earthverse life bad enough to make you an exit candidate. And I find it HOT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luck punctuated this by grabbing Alex&#39;s crotch, a new boner popping up already. &quot;Don&#39;t be shy just cause I&#39;m not your friend! I&#39;m still going to fuck you though. And you&#39;re going to like it at least as much as I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
A charm effect washed over Alex&#39;s mind. Luck continued talking as a dumb smile crossed Alex&#39;s face. &quot;Got it? Good. Now take that dick out before I take it off. If somebody wants me to cosplay Lady Luck at a multiversal god party I might as well practice what those &#39;woman&#39; things have somehow, and your tool&#39;s looking more charming than mine. Act fast or I&#39;ll borrow it balls and all, dude-o.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex let his pants drop that Luck could inspect his prize physically rather than through godsense, before both men opted to chuck their clothes (including Alex&#39;s plug) into inventories entirely. Luck frotted an already hard five inches against Alex&#39;s six, grinning dirtily at the thought of another bigger-dicked bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, nice and obedient when you&#39;re charmed. You&#39;ll get to do this to your fair share of dummy thick enemies soon enough, but don&#39;t expect to turn the tables unless you can level grind a lot faster than an idling god. Might ride that meat later though.&quot;<br />
Luck gave Alex a kiss that Alex was too blissed out to really respond to, before picking up the rather light man (passive floating, hah) and bracing him against the shop wall. One hand guiding Luck&#39;s dick to Alex&#39;s hungry hole, the other jerking off Alex&#39;s cock, Luck ordered &quot;Make your dick bigger. Go for like a footlong or something, and increase the thickness to match. Gimme a firework shot when you cum, pretty sparkles and everything. We&#39;re gonna celebrate you being my new fucktoy whenever you roll badly enough that you need to be bailed out from all the evil that wants a piece of that bod, me included.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex obeyed, his cock expanding enough to make Luck take it in both hands to steady it for licking the shaft even as he kept pounding Alex against the wall. As Luck neared orgasm, he pulled out, then set Alex down to spray cum in the unlucky bottom&#39;s absentmindedly open mouth, a single word order to swallow driving him to gulp it down with gusto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, good boy.&quot; Luck said, job satisfied. &quot;Cum now, then you can put yourself back to normal. Have a nice day, slut-to-be.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a twitch of his cock, Alex comically shot out a miniature firework burst that rose up and lit the alleyway in a shower of heatless bright magical sparkles. Satisfied, it shrank down to its normal six inches and a humanly possible thickness, easing its way down to flaccidity beyond that. The charm effect snapped off Alex, and he blinked moreso at the return of full consciousness rather than his strangely complete lack of objection to being mind controlled and taken in the streets. Well, this world WAS one that matched his fetishes according to information from his skill system...<br />
<br />
As Luck vanished, Alex shook aside the stunning revelations related to being an isekai hero and the local version of Luck being a horny villain, then tried to think of his next move. More information from the life he&#39;d been inserted into stumbled into his head, mostly the inn he&#39;d been staying at. Most of the rest, the adventurers&#39; guild where he got most of his income for both gratuitous prostitution and actually helping with quests and whatnot. That&#39;d be interesting...</p>
