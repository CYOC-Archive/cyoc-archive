<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Much Later When Jeff Woke Up, He Was Staring At The Ceiling  To See A Mobile, He Struggled To A Sitting Position, Where He Saw He Was In A Baby Crib In The Crib Was A Bunch Of Stuffed Animals, Toys And Even A Pacifier Which Seemed To Be In His Mouth And He Spit Out Sometime In His Sleep As It Was Wet At The Part You Suck. When He Tried To Call Out To Mason, All That Came Out Was Baby Talk. Jeff Was Able To Look Around His Room, Which Was No Longer His Bedroom But Looked Like A Nursery, The Floor Was Covered With A Soft Plush Carpet. There Was A White Bookshelf Next To The Door, Filled With Baby Books Whose Titles He Couldn&#39;t Make Out As They Looked Like Gibberish, There Was Also A Rocking Chair Next To His Crib.<br />
<br />
When Jeff Attempted To Climb Out Of The Crib He Fell On His Butt Back In The Crib Causing Him To Cry It Didn&#39;t Hurt But He Felt Defeated. He Heard The Door Open And In Came An Adult Woman Who Didn&#39;t Look Anything Like His Mom.<br />
<br />
She Held A Baby Bottle Full Of Milk As She Walked Over To The Crib, &quot;There, There, Sweetheart, What&#39;s Wrong&quot; She Asked. She Picked Up Jeff And Put Him In Her Lap, She Then Fed Him The Baby Bottle Of Milk. Once Jeff Finished, She Gave Him His Pacifier And Set Him On The Ground In A Gated Area, With Baby Toys To Play With, When Jeff Looked Up At Her He Noticed She Was Still A Young Lady Probably In Her Late 20&#39;s.<br />
<br />
She Had Short Hair And Wore Glasses, She Looked Very Professional But Had A Very Nice Smile, Her Body Was Quite Beautiful She Was Curvy. She Was Wearing A Blouse That Wasn&#39;t Buttoned Properly. She Didn&#39;t Have On A Bra So Her <b class="highlight">Breast</b>s Were Popping Out Of The Blouse.<br />
<br />
Jeff Did His Best To Say &quot;Mason&quot; But It Was Jumbled In Baby Speak And Barely Coherent, &quot;Shhh, Sweetie... Mason Is Gone... Only Mommy Remains Can You Say Mommy?&quot; The Woman Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom---my?&quot; Jeff Managed To Get Out Questioningly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s My Baby Boy&quot; She Says Picking Up Jeff And Lifting Him Above Her Head Before Kissing Him On The Forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Sweetheart, Mommy Has To Go Your Big Sister Mandy Is Still Getting Used To Me As Your New Mommy... You And Her Are Now Full Time Kids&quot; She Says Sitting Jeff Back Down On The Floor With The Toys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wai-- Mas--on--- Tha--t Y-ou?&quot; Jeff Says As The Woman Begins To Leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sweetheart, That Was Me... But Now I Go By Macy... But It&#39;s Mommy To You... Remember That&quot; She Says And Leaves.<br />
<br />
Jeff Was Confused He Didn&#39;t Know How This Happened, Did Mason Do This? Why? And What Happened To His Mom? And Big Sister? He Wanted To Be His Old Self, But He Exactly Get To The Computer Which Didn&#39;t Seem To Be In This Room... Which Wouldn&#39;t Have Mattered To Much Cause Even If It Was In Here He Couldn&#39;t Get Past The Baby Gate... He Would Just Have To Wait Until Macy Came Back, He Tried To Make Another Attempt At Getting Past The Baby Gate But It Was Futile... So He Decided To Try And Pass The Time By Playing With The Baby Toys Which Were Surprisingly Fun Despite Being At Least Somewhat Mentally 16.<br />
<br />
Later On Macy Came Back In, &quot;Mommy Is Back, Sweetheart,&quot; Macy Says, Smiling Down At The Toddler. She Then Picks Up Jeff And Sits Down In The Rocking Chair And Holds Him In Her Lap, &quot;How Are You Today, Sweetie? I See You Had Fun With Your Toys&quot; Macy asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma-son&quot; Jeff says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetheart, It&#39;s Mommy To You&quot; Macy says, &quot;But I Can See You Want To Know What Happened. I&#39;ll Tell You If You Say Mommy&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff Nods, &quot;M-om-my&quot; He says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll Explain,&quot; Macy begins, &quot;After You Fell Asleep After Losing The Bet, I Having Just Experienced <b class="highlight">Breast</b> Feeding For The First Time Didn&#39;t Want To Change Back...But Right Then Your Mom Returned And Caught Me... I Explained Who I Was... What I Did Too You And How I Felt And She Decided To Let Me Be The Mom For Awhile... She Then Made Herself A 16 Year Old Teen Girl... I Then Aged Myself Up Making Myself The Mother Of You, Her, And Mandy... I Am Now Your New Mommy And They Are Your New Big Sisters.&quot;<br />
Jeff Then Tries His Best To Mutter How Long He Will Be Like This, <br />
<br />
&quot;Not Sure, Sweetheart, Until I Am Satisfied... That Could Be A Couple Days, Weeks, Months, I&#39;m Honestly Not Sure? But Don&#39;t Worry About It, Sweetheart... I Promise To Be A Good Mommy To You&quot; Macy says.<br />
<br />
Jeff Wants To Say Something But Begins To Fuss As He Is Getting Hungry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are You Hungry, Sweetheart,&quot; Macy Asks, Smiling Down At The Toddler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hung—ry,&quot; Jeff replies Holding His Stomach Which Was In A Lot Of Pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, I&#39;ll Fix That,&quot; Macy Says, Smiling And Then Opening Her Blouse And Revealing Her Right <b class="highlight">Breast</b>. She Then Pulls Jeff Up Into A Position Where His Mouth Can Latch Onto Her <b class="highlight">Nipple</b> And Soon And Without Fuss Jeff Begins To Nurse.<br />
<br />
After Jeff Is Done, Macy Puts Her <b class="highlight">Breast</b> Away And Burps Him Before Setting Him Down In The Crib.<br />
&quot;Sweetheart, Mommy Has To Go Do Some Things With Daddy, So She Will Be Back In A  Little Bit To Check On You&quot; Macy says As She Leaves The Room.<br />
<br />
Jeff Eyes Widen As He Realizes What Exactly She Just Said And His Mind Begins Racing With His Thoughts<br />
&quot;DADDY!?&quot;, &quot;Was It Still His Normal Dad...? And What Was The Things Macy Was Doing With Him... Was She Really About To??&quot;, &quot;Would His Former Mom, Now Big Sister Be Okay With That?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, Stop, Don&#39;t Think About That&quot; Jeff Scolded Himself, He Really Didn&#39;t Want To Think About That... A Moment Later Jeff Felt Something Press Against His Lower Section Of His Body, He Looks Down To See A Large Wet Spot Forming In The Crotch Of His Diaper... He Could Feel The Warmth From The Urine... He Must&#39;ve Noticed He Needed To Go And His Baby Instincts Took Over And Began To Cry...<br />
<br />
But The Person Who Came In To Help Wasn&#39;t Macy It Was A 16 Year Old Looking Young Girl With Long Hair.<br />
She Wore A T-Shirt That Exposed Her Belly Button And Pants, She Held A Baby Bottle Full Of Milk As She Held Him In Her Lap, &quot;There, <br />
There, Jeffie, What&#39;s Wrong?&quot; She Asked.<br />
<br />
She Picked Up Jeff And After Seeing His Wet Diaper Pulled Down His Diaper And Started Wiping His Rear End With A Wet Nappy, Then Pulled His Diaper Back Up.<br />
<br />
She Then Fed Him The Baby Bottle Full Of Milk, After Jeff Finished, She Gave Him His Pacifier. She Set Him Back Down In The Crib.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jeffie, How Are You Liking Being A Baby Again?&quot; The Girl Says Smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... Mommy?&quot; Jeff Mutters<br />
<br />
&quot;I Was... Now I&#39;m Just Your Big Sister Isabelle Or Izzy For Short!&quot; Isabelle Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-sabel?&quot; Jeff Says, &quot;B-aby... No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, You Don&#39;t Want To Be A Baby Again? Sorry, Jeffie But, I&#39;m Not The One Who Will Decide... You&#39;ll Just Have To Wait For Macy To Decide <br />
When She&#39;s Done With What She&#39;s Doing&quot; Isabelle Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Mommy Doing With Daddy?&quot; Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Isabelle Giggles, &quot;Oh, She&#39;s Fucking Him Obviously&quot; She Replies, &quot;But I&#39;m Sure You Won&#39;t Understand That.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You.. No... Bot...Terred?&quot; Jeff Mutters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, Oh No, I&#39;m Not Bothered... It&#39;s Normal For A Mommy And Daddy To Have Fun Together... Plus, I&#39;m Now His Biological Daughter, So It&#39;s Not Weird For Me,&quot; Isabelle replies.<br />
<br />
Jeff Then Yawns And His Eyes Get Heavy... Isabelle Notices And Picks Up A Teddy Bear And Gives It To Jeff Who Grabs It Instinctively... She Then Places The Pacifier In His Mouth And Whispers &quot;Nap Time&quot; Before Leaving Slowly And Turning Out The Lights. And Leaves The Room</p>
