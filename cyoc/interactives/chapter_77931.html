<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris started tapping away on the computer.  Erica was too absorbed in her cellphone to even notice.  Her fingers were flying across the keys, tapping out text messages.  She sighed and looked up.  &quot;What is Josh doing?  I really need to talk to both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shower..&quot;  Chris looked up from his computer screen and shrugged, before going back to modifying Erica's profile.  Erica's gaze lingered on him a bit longer, he could tell she would leap on a chance to screw either him or Josh, despite her being in a relationship.  It was then that inspiration struck.  She could have one or both of them.  With a grin he finished up his planned changes, looking them over.<br />

<br />
Chris thought it was pretty good.  Give Josh someone other than Chris to give his attentions to, and well, Chris could participate once in a while.  He chose to make sure no one would notice Erica's changes, except for himself, and because they were linked, Josh.  But he didn't think he'd have a problem with the changes.  He pushed to start the changes and leaned back in his chair, turning to watch Erica's change.<br />
<br />
It was noticeable almost immediately.  Erica shifted in her seat as if she couldn't quite get comfortable, and Chris could see why.  Her clothes, already tight on her were stretching beyond their capacity.  He tugged on the collar of her shirt, trying to free some extra room.  Her shoulders were expanding and her limbs were stretching longer.  Already she looked to be about six inches taller than she was before.  The bottom of her skirt was riding high enough that her black panties could easily be seen, as well as a few inches of bared flesh between her skirt and the bottom of her shirt.  The muscle of her stomach was becoming more firm.  It looked like her stretching shirt was smashing her breasts down, but as Chris watched he could tell they were actually shrinking.  Erica shifted in her seat again, tugging at her shirt and skirt, not even seeming to notice how poorly they fit now.<br />
<br />
Her too tight shirt gave way with a loud ripping noise.  Her torso had elongated, muscle definition starting to show.  Her pert breasts were exposed to the air, no larger than a B cup now, and shrinking by the second.  Her skirt and panties didn't last much longer, tearing free of her waist.  She kicked off her shoes herself as they became too tight for her growing feet.  She was still obviously a woman, but was much taller and more athletic.  The petite socialite was gone, replaced by a woman who most would take one look at and assume to be an athlete.<br />
<br />
Her face was losing some of its rounded femininity.  Her jaw was becoming more square, her nose bolder and her brow heavier.  Her hair began to retreat back into her scalp, growing in reverse.  Inches disappeared from her locks, but it retained its bright blond color.  Her large nipples were shrinking down, though her nipples had become hard from their exposure to the air.  Her breasts were shrinking down past A cup.  They didn't flatten out completely, instead the skin became taught around a firm set of growing pectoral muscles.  Her arms and legs had thickened with muscle as well, her hands and feet no longer dainty and feminine.  Her painted nails lost their color, their finely manicured tips retreating back into a man's typical short clipped nails.  The makeup on her face started to fade away, giving way to her natural skin tones.<br />
<br />
Strangely, Erica was still obsessed with her cell phone, like nothing was happening to her.  Her hand slipped down between her legs, though instead of slipping inside her slit, her finger rubbed against unbroken skin, and up to her clit, which looked swollen.  As she touched it it grew larger, pushing outwards.  The tip formed into the mushroom head of a cock, a veiny shaft continuing to swell large behind it.  The skin at the base of her new penis loosened, a saggy empty pouch of skin hanging down between her legs.  She let out a small gasp as a testicle dropped down into the sac, the touch of her fingers on her groin caused the second to drop.<br />
<br />
As her, or rather his new endowment continued to grow in size, his shaved and waxed pubic area began to grow curly dark blond slightly reddish hair.  The same hair started growing in along his legs and arms.  Hair sprouted up his tight abs, and up to his pectorals.  It grew in thick, though only an even half inch or so in length, nice and evenly trimmed.  The entirety of his pectorals was covered in the clipped blond chest hair, and if left to grow Chris could tell it would be thicker than what he and Josh were sporting.<br />
<br />
His head hair and finished retreating, leaving only two inches of blond hair ontop of his head, which took on a spikey gelled style.  His hair grew further down in front of his ears, long sideburns down to his jaw.  His facial hair curled forward along his jaw, meeting at his chin.  Chris could see a little bit of stubble on the rest of Erica.. Eric's face.<br />
<br />
When Chris looked up he saw Josh standing in the doorway, nothing but a towel around his waist as he watched Eric in fascination.  Josh looked over and met Chris' eyes, grinning like an eager maniac.  Chris just shrugged and tried to look as innocent as possible.<br />
<br />
Eric's changes were finishing, a few last inches of cock growing in.  His muscles gained a bit more bulk and his skin started to darken with a nice healthy tan, spreading until only the faint outline of a speedo could be seen about his waist.  With the changes done, the spell over Eric seemed to break, as if he finally noticed things going on around him again.  He looked over to Josh, grinning lewdly as he looked Chris' still damp twin up and down.  He got to his feet, moving closer pretty much completely oblivious to the fact he was naked.  &quot;Hey, bro..&quot;  He had a deep voice, with a heavy California surfer accent to it.  He wrapped his arms around Josh and locked his lips in a deep kiss.<br />
<br />
After almost a full minute of liplock, Chris coughed to get theri attention.  &quot;So, Eric, you said you had an emergency?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked confused for a minute, as if he was having trouble remembering.  Though Chris was sure it was a moment of confusion coming from new memories.  Then he snapped is fingers.  &quot;Oh yeah.  They're doing some work out by my apartment, and me and Mark need a place to crash for a few days.  You dudes wouldn't mind would you?  I mean, you got this big place to yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris almost laughed, Mark.  Who had been Erica's boyfriend was reduced to Eric's roommate.  Though before Chris could speak up, Josh broke in.  &quot;Course, babe.  As long as Mark doesn't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric laughs.  &quot;Bro acts straight, but I think he's got a thing for you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Josh gave Chris a look from across the room, mouthing silently, 'My turn..'</p>
