<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cold air could be felt across Agent Bishops exposed skin as they sailed across the water in contrast to the hot sun shining down on them. They would start to stir a bit as they opened their eyes and were met with tinted vision of the sky as they were wearing sunglasses. They could feel the odd feeling of hair all along their head something they weren&#39;t use to with how short their hair was normally kept. They felt a bizarre feeling in their chest and lips as she started to sit up and then let out a girlish shriek as they sat up looking gown to a massive pair of boobs. Their hands moving and grabbing them and they felt firmer then expected. Their shape more round and spherical then you&#39;d expect from a pair of natural boobs... no these were more tits then boobs. A pair of big fake tits bolted on to her chest as she stood up and moved inside of the boat looking around still a little groggy as she found a bathroom.<br />
<br />
Their jaw dropped as they looked at their new reflection. Standing in their place was a woman with tanned skin and long wavy dark brown hair that came down to her shoulder blades. Her face looked like it was done up in make up. Her lips looked full and felt kind of numb as well. Bringing their hand to poke their lip they would notice they had long nails with a purple polish. They looked at their hand for just a moment before looking back to their reflection taking off their sunglasses and noticing their piercing grey eyes. They looked down looking at their large bust and cupping their chest. They felt heavier then expected and were hardly supported in a tiny blue bikini with a yellow trim. They were a lot hotter then anything Agent Bishop touched before. In fact everything about her new look was way out of her former league. She looked like some high class trophy wife with a perfect pair of fake tits. Their hands moving down to touch their toned tummy. Their skin was still soft but it also felt a little different. Like it was a little more damaged from tanning in the past. Turning to her side her mouth hung open at her impossibly perky ass sticking out in a real shelf grabbing it. This was the sort of woman Agent Bishop would spent hours jerking off to if they still could.<br />

<br />
[&quot;That asshole!&quot;] she said and gasped hearing her sexy voice speak something other then English. Focusing on it now she wasn&#39;t even thinking in English all this time. She glared looking even more worked up now as she moved out of the room looking around and noticing a folder lying on the bed. She went and opened it slipping through it and gasped in horror realizing it was English and couldn&#39;t read it. She no longer knew english!? She looked over the documents and could tell they were files about their new life&#39;s. She flipped through pages and kept seeing the word Malcom Green on lots and lots of papers and figured it was clearly their new paper trail and list of assets. She seemed confused as she didn&#39;t seem to find much about her own life thought except for a high school diploma for a woman named Camilia Santos. &quot;Cam&quot; she thought to herself remember the name she was told she&#39;d have.<br />
<br />
[&quot;I&#39;m going to kill him!&quot;] she said before finding something that made her stomach turning. This paper in her hand seemed like it was some kind of wedding ticket with her name listed on it.<br />
<br />
[&quot;And... oh god, am I a fucking trophy wife?!&quot;] she blurted out before looking over more papers unable to read most of them. She did find some bank statements that seemed to belong to Cole or well Malcom now listed a lot of money. She then found a bank statement listed in her name and it confused her. It was full of negative numbers. She couldn&#39;t read all of it but recognized a few words that seemed her new identity was familiar with. One of them was Brazilian and with her new look and name and the fact she was speaking Portuguese she assumed that she was a Brazilian woman now. Another word was &quot;Butt&quot; she saw something listed as &quot;Brazilian Butt.... something?... wait... BRAZILIAN BUTT LIFT?!&quot; she gasped at the thought grabbing her big ass she thought looked impossibly big and perky before. She then noticed something very expensive that has words she didn&#39;t know but understood one thing... 800 CC... those were implant numbers....&quot; she felt kind of sick at the thought looking down to her deep cleavage snug in her bikini and cupped her boobs noting how they were so firm and perfectly shaped knowing she had implants.<br />
<br />
[&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anyone use this setting on the nanobots...&quot;] she mumbled as she cupped her tits and poked her lips again. It wasn&#39;t common since the nanobots could make any of the changes &quot;real&quot; so to speak, but you could set them to alter a person&#39;s body and then convert into inorganic materials like silicone and collagen if you were taking on the role of someone with work done.<br />
<br />
Looking back into the bathroom at her reflection from across the room there was no denying it. She looked like the type of woman who has put a lot of time, work, and money into looking as hot and perfect as possible. Just then she heard the door open turning over to see.</p>
