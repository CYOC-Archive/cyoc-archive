<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Karen left, Jesse and Andy had dinner with their parents. They both felt very awkward after everything they just did, but their parents filled the silence with their own conversation. Something about dad’s office starting a new project and mom’s workplace hiring a new HR rep, but neither of the brothers paid much attention. The entire time, Jesse shifted in his seat, his ass still sore from…earlier… and kept making small glances to Andy. <br />
The evening wrapped up with no excitement as every member of the family turned in for bed. Mom and dad went to their room at 9:30, leaving only their two kids. Jesse and Andy sat in silence for thirty minutes before they each went to their rooms. Jesse tried to sleep, but kept tossing and turning for what felt like an eternity. Finally, he got up and turned his lights on. His room was still a mess from today’s events. He took off his pants to view his Femboy curves, his cock was still very small and kinda wimpy. His ass on the other hand. His cheeks were huge and curvy, sticking out farther from his waist in perfectly plump mounds of sexiness. Posing in front of his mirror, he marveled at the two Christmas hams that composed his beautiful backside. Jesse reached his hand into the crack and marveled at how deep he could go before even reaching his overly sensitive hole, all the way to the knuckles and maybe even more! He could feel himself getting horny and his tiny pencil cock started to rise to attention. He glanced at the clock, it was already past 11:00, but he couldn’t sleep, he needed some release and new exactly where he needed it from. <br />
Jesse quietly opened his bedroom door and stepped into the hallway. In his haste, he forgot his pants but the cool breeze of the hallway AC felt wonderful on his puckered anus. He gingerly stepped to the opposite end of the hall, farther from his parent’s room. They were heavy sleepers so he wasn’t worried about getting caught in any activity that may transpire. He snuck over to Andy’s room and tried the door handle; to his surprise, it opened. He swung the door open slowly to find his brother was as awake as he was. Andy laying on his bed, was massaging his 11 inch rod, though not fast enough to masterbate to. The two brothers froze in surprise before Jesse hastily entered and shut the door. This time, he had the sense to lock it. <br />
“J-Jesse! I wasn’t…uh…what are you doing in here?!” <br />
“Andy, I can’t sleep. I can’t stop thinking about…earlier…”<br />
Jesse strolled over the Andy’s bedside and sat down, emphasizing his ass on the way down. He positioned himself so his ass would be pushing into Andy’s hip, mere inches away from the only thing that could satisfy him. <br />
“We-we shouldn’t do that again.” Andy stammered “I mean you’re my freaking brother! That’s like, really weird!” <br />
“Please Andy. I’m begging here! I’ve never felt anything like that before and I know you haven’t either. Besides, we still need to get my cock back and this is the best way to do it!” <br />
Jesse positioned himself to straddle over Andy’s legs, the massive cock extending over Jesse’s stomach. This sight sent both the them into a horny sensation. <br />
“Andy! Please fuck me!”<br />
Without a moment wasted, Andy grabbed Jesse’s ass cheeks and groped. Jesse, already starting to pant, and raised his goods over the monster that laid in front of him. In one swift motion, he plunged Andy’s cock into his gapping anus. He slid down about 6 inches before Andy began pumping his member. The two began to grind into each other, slowly adopting a rhythm. Jesse was panting and meaning through his teeth, twerking desperately as his craved more meat for his insides. Andy continued to grope Jesse’s rear and pump harder with every thrust. <br />
Jesse could feel his G spot being prodded with every jab from Andy’s cock. <br />
Jesse began to twerk harder, letting a full 8 inches in. A solid bulge began to appear in his abdomen. He was in heaven, his insides were filled nearly completely with Andy’s meat. As he did this, Andy felt the pressure pushing on all sides of his cock, yet he could still slide in and out of Jesse’s tight little hole. <br />
Andy continued to thrust hungrily into Jesse’s ass, all the while continuing to play with it like molding a lump of clay. The two continued to moan through their teeth as their passion was reaching a higher climax. Andy felt pressure building in his massive balls before starting to build at the base of his cock. He reached his limit, it was time. <br />
“Jesse~…I’m gonna…uh…uh~…blow!”<br />
The barely conscious Jesse quickly grabbed Andy’s hips and slammed his ass as far as he could go, finally taking the full 11 inch monster into his ass. <br />
“Here it…co-uh-comes! Ah…uh~~…AARGH~~!”<br />
Andy’s monster cock began to stream the full force of his most powerful orgasm to date. Seed spewed out into the cavern of Jesse’s insides before filling up any available space left. The two moaned in unison, neither caring about how loud they were anymore. After a full minute of pumps and pulses, Andy’s cum was spent. Both boys were exhausted. Jesse, tiredness getting the better of him, collapsed into Andy’s chest. The monster cock that brought them together was laughed out of Jesse’s cavernous ass with a satisfying “pop”. Jesse, his ass in the air and leaking cum, quickly fell asleep on Andy’s chest.</p>
