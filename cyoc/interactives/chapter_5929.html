<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim and Kelvin re-entered the house, Tim went first, his cock growing in his overalls as he thought of all the things he could do to Kelvin upstairs. Behind him he could sense that Kelvin had begun to change, he grinned….this afternoon was going to be so much fun! <br />
<br />
Tim half turned to say something to Kelvin when something caught his attention out of the corner of his eye- the box was still here! Tal had not taken it. Tim’s dick softened quickly<br />
“Kelvin” he said pointing, Kelvin growled behind him<br />
“Damm” Tim stepped over to the table and picked up the box. <br />
“There’s a safe in the cellar, I’ll put this and the crystal in there. Why don’t you go upstairs and……get comfortable?” Kelvin grinned a semi-fanged grin at him. As he went past Tim he leaned over and kissed him. <br />
<br />
Tim cock surged back to full erection as Kelvin’s lips met his; he opened his mouth and let Kelvin’s probing tongue in. He reached out with one thick arm and pulled Kelvin closer rubbing his thick beard into his. Kelvin reached out and swept Tim into a huge Bear hug. Tim drank in Kelvin’s smell and felt himself beginning to change, his body swelling with muscle, fur and passion. Kelvin pressed his tongue deeper into Tim’s mouth, swirling it round Tim’s sharp teeth. <br />
<br />
Tim pressed himself into Kelvin one arm trapped between their thick bodies. Kelvin was changing shape too, both of them thickening, and growing together. Their clothes began to rip across the chest and up the leg as they became Bears. Tim’s cock throbbed and he willed the change faster; claws pushed out of his hands, he could feel the leather of his boots beginning to give way as his feet exploded in size. His mouth grew longer into a semi-muzzle and he tilted his head so his mouth was sideways to Kelvin’s own brown-white muzzle, their fangs interlocking together as their long tongue probed deep into each others throats. <br />
<br />
Belly pressed against fur covered belly, hard cocks rubbing against each other. Each muscle twitched with passion as they grew into their Man-Bear forms. Kelvin moved his hips slightly to accommodate his thick thighs, the overalls spilt all along the seem as he did; his swaying sent a shockwave of pleasure up Tim’s cock and with a ‘whumpf’ from his nose he came, spewing his seed inside the ripped overalls and spurting out up their furred bellies. Tim racked his claws across the overalls hanging off Kelvin’s back shredding the cloth. Kelvin felt Tim’s orgasm and came as well, pleasure ripping though him, he hugged Tim deeper. <br />
<br />
Panting the two separated with only little licks of each others black noses. Their overalls were hanging off them and their belly fur was splattered with each others cum. They started laughing, deep belly laughs that shook the windows.<br />
“Oh man, look at you” Kelvin rumbled. He reached out a long arm and pulled the overall remains from Tim’s chest, the flap sliding under his huge furry belly. Tim’s semi-hard cock popped out and dribbled cum on the floor. <br />
“Look who’s talking” Tim guffawed and ripped the overalls from Kelvin’s hips. The garment fell away from completely leaving Kelvin naked, his massive hard cock still pointing out and ready. Tim swiped a paw-hand at it making it bob up and down <br />
“Man, I’m ready for that” he laughed. “but let me put this down stairs first” Kelvin grinned showing off his long fangs.<br />
“Sure. I’ll be upstairs waiting for you” he said stepping out of the ruined clothes. He grabbed Tim by the shoulder and squeezed slightly “don’t be long” he rumbled in a lower voice “I can wait forever”<br />
Tim ran his thick ursine tongue over his fangs. <br />
“I’ll be there” he said in a low bass tone that sent sparks to Kelvin’s cock. Kelvin turned and lumbered over to the stairs, each one creaking in protest as his huge ursine body climbed them. Tim watched him go marvelling at the beauty of his furry butt and stubby tail. He could feel himself getting hard again.<br />
“Damm” he said to himself. He pulled the crystal from the pocket of the overalls. He considered stripping off the ripped overall but decided to leave that pleasure for Kelvin. <br />
<br />
Tim opened the under stairs door with his paw-hand. He lacked some of the dexterity of his Human hand but his strength was so much more. Tim felt much more comfortable in this Bearman form than in his Human skin. He felt more in touch with who he was. Big as his Human form now was he missed the seer BEARness of his ursine self. Tim chuckled to himself as he squeezed his big form down into the cellar. When he reached the lower door he admitted defeat and concentrated on shifting down to Human again, the overalls nearly falling away from his smaller body as he did. Tim rehung the overalls from the shoulder straps before going in.<br />
<br />
The cellar was as in both Tim’s memories. Disorganized office stuff archived down here along with Hank’s old oak deck and his battered leather office chair. The desk was covered in neat piles of filing that Tim had not done. The whole area was huge stretching out under and beyond the base of the house, evidence of a larger house having stood there years before. Tim crossed the cellar comfortably, he knew its various holes and uneven surfaces. In the far corner, next to the old still Hank’s father had made, was a pile of paving slabs, and behind them and built into the stone wall was the safe. Tim shifted the slabs easily. He still marvelled at his strength in this body, but he could not argue with results and quickly gained access. <br />
<br />
Spin left, spin right, dah, dah, click, clunk. Tim opened the safe and placed the box gently on top of the piles of paper. The gems winked at him on the cellar strip lights. Tim was reminded that there were more gems on the box, and more keys. He grinned. Another time. He placed the crystal on another shelf under the papers and stuff. No point risking it rolling around despite what Tal said.<br />
<br />
Done Tim shut and locked the safe before heading back up stairs. He was smiling as he crossed the cellar and pulled the cellar door shut. Kelvin was in for some wild time as his memory fed him various position, games and other things he could do to him. As Tim climbed the stairs he shifted back to Bearman form and was rubbing his cock oh yeah he was going to have fun…..<br />
<br />
As Tim came out of the cellar a voice greeted him<br />
“Stop right there Shifter. We have you covered  with enough firepower to kill even you. Don’t play the hero”. Tim looked round confused. Standing by the base of the stairs was a big, barn door of a man in a  black suit, another stood in the lounge, a third by the front door and he could smell the fourth by the back. They were armed. <br />
“Who are you?” Tim growled wondering what had happened to Kelvin. <br />
The one in the lounge stepped closer, he was obviously the leader. He slowly looked Tim up and down and snorted. <br />
“We are………”</p>
