<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My strong need to go to the bathroom returned.  I pulled down my pants and sat on the toilet.  Peeing with my new vagina felt a little odd.  When I finished I left the bathroom and stood looking around this strange, darkened house.  What was I going to do?  A pair of strong arms suddenly reached around me from behind and grabbed my waist.  One hand then reached down and grabbed my ass, and it felt like a jolt of electricity went through me.  I gave out a girlish yelp.  Did I actually like that feeling?<br />
<br />
I turned around and found myself face to face with a red haired, teenaged boy.  He was shirtless and was showing off a well defined chest.  A surge of need came to me.  This boy was hot!  Wait, I didn't think boys were hot, did I?  What was going on?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kelly, want another go at it?&quot;<br />
<br />
So the girl's name was Kelly?  I tried to think of something to say to him, but thoughts were coming hard to me now.  &quot;I... ummm...&quot;  Then I giggled.<br />
<br />
He smiled and started kissing me.  Part of my mind screamed out in shock and alarm, but the rest of me didn't care.  This boy was HOT, and I wanted him!  I started kissing back.  I realized I was now thinking and acting like Kelly, and she was definitely a slut.  She also didn't seem very bright.  Without thinking I took off my pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whooh, Kelly, not here.&quot;  He guided me to a bedroom and closed the door.  This was going to be fun!  He ripped off his clothes while I took off the rest of mine.  We quickly were on the bed together.  I moaned in delight as I felt his manhood penetrate my new womanhood.  This feeling!  It was so GOOD!<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
A while passed, I don't know how long.  I sat up on the bed and giggled.  It was so good being in this sexy body!  I could have any boy I wanted!<br />
<br />
No, wait!  I stopped myself.  This wasn't me, was it?  My mind was still moving slowly.  I remembered that I was thinking like a dumb bimbo.  This wasn't good, I had to return to myself somehow!  I had to get out of here and find that little girl with the device.  I didn't remember where I left the jeans I was wearing before, but I did find a pair of girl's shorts near the bed along with the rest of my clothes.  I put them on, left the bedroom and saw a cute brunette girl who was waking up.<br />
<br />
Through my cloudy mind, I figured that Kelly must have a purse.  I had no clue what it looked like, though.  I walked up to the brunette and said, &quot;Hi!  Ummm, could you tell me where my like, purse is?&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave me a funny look.  &quot;It's the red one over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh, thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
I picked up the purse.  As I walked past the brunette toward a door I heard her mutter under her breath, &quot;Dumb blonde.&quot;<br />
<br />
I left the house and looked around the street.  The morning sun was just about to rise.  I was in a residential neighborhood, but I didn't know where.  I found a pair of car keys in the purse, but I didn't know which car they belonged to.  I went back to the house and found the brunette again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm, could you tell me which car is mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at me incredulously and then started laughing.  &quot;It's the white one on the corner!  Geez, Tom was right, you are thick, aren't you?&quot;  My only response was to giggle.<br />
<br />
I went back outside and found a dusty, white sports coupe parked on a nearby street corner.  I groaned as I found it had a manual transmission.  I knew how to drive manual, but not well.  I clumsily started driving down the street.  After a few minutes I recognized the name of another street I was passing.  With relief I realized I was still in my city and could find a way back to my house.  I turned onto the street.  After a few minutes I realized I was going the wrong way and turned around with a giggle.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
I parked across the street from my house.  I remembered having a spare set of keys hidden away, but it took me a few minutes to recall where I hid them.  I unlocked my front door and went inside.  I found the young girl awake and making herself at home.  She was cooking eggs for breakfast.  I wondered how I could tell her what had happened to me.<br />
<br />
She looked at me and asked, &quot;You messed with my remote, didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gasped when I realized she already knew.  &quot;Oh gosh!  How'd you know I was, like, me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I woke up, my prototype had been moved and you were missing.  I figured you would either be returning here as yourself and with help for me, or you would be returning here in a different body.&quot;  She laughed.  &quot;Looks like you got yourself an interesting one.  I can also tell you have part of her personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you like, change me back from Kelly to myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.  Just one minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
I watched as the girl ate the eggs, then we went to my guest bedroom.  She picked up and pressed a few buttons on the remote, while briefly explaining what it did.<br />
<br />
&quot;This prototype has the ability to transfer your mind into another person's body.  Your body and DNA is scanned, disintegrated and stored in the device.  The other person's thought patterns are also stored in it.  I'll use it now to rematerialize your body, put your mind back into it, and return the girl's mind to her body.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was confused, this sounded complicated.  Trying to think using Kelly's dim brain was not getting me very far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will this, you know, make me turn from Kelly back into myself and stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome.  Do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl pressed a button on the remote.  She waited a minute, frowned, and pushed the same button a few more times.  &quot;Very strange.  I wonder why it didn't work...&quot;  She thought for a few seconds and asked me, &quot;Have you had any close contact with another person since you entered that body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm, I did have sex with some guy before I came here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had sex with a guy??  But, weren't you a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I like, totally lost control!  I couldn't stop myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her personality must really be getting to you.  Well, having sex would do it.  Although it's just a trace amount, you still have some foreign DNA in your body from the other guy's semen.  That will confuse the scanner in the remote enough to prevent it from switching you back.  I have a theory that by killing Kelly, you might get switched you back into your body.&quot;  She paused.  &quot;I am NOT recommending that we do that.  It might not work, anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm, does that mean I'm trapped as Kelly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I was trapped.  Trapped as a dumb, blond bimbo.  I felt despondent.  I started to cry.<br />
<br />
As I sobbed, the girl said, &quot;Well, there is one option for you.  I can't give your old body back, but I can use the device to give you your old mind.  You said that you lost control before.  I can prevent that from happening again by taking away the girl's urges.  I can also give you back your intellect.  This is a new function though, and all of the bugs haven't been worked out yet.  Sometimes it works just fine, and sometimes there are side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Side effects?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes.  Sometimes it's just a minor physical change, but once I saw someone get unlucky.  I'm very grateful I was finally able to finally reverse what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unlucky?  That like, sounds bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Missy, do you want me to help you out here or not?  What is it that you want?&quot;</p>
