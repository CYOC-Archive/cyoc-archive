<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen pulled her car into the school parking lot and jumped out.  She had sped to school, fearing she'd be late, but she still had fifteen minutes before the bell rang.  Adjusting her book bag over her shoulders she set out towards the building.  As always three of her closest friends stood outside the doors, talking and chatting.  All of them had their free period first, but they still had to report for attendance before they could go off a hang out.<br />
<br />
Brad her boyfriend had his back to her, his broad shoulders and short black hair  being mostly what was visible.  He was cute enough, but he was the quarterback for the varsity football team.  That and he was hung like a.. well, she shivered thinking about it.  Next to him stood Alicia, another of the schools cheerleaders.  Her dark mocha skin always looked flawless, and her black hair was done in a multitude of beaded braids that she had pulled back in a ponytail.  The third person in the group was Alicia's boyfriend Mark.  They seemed so different, it was hard to believe they were even a couple.  Where she was dark he was pale, even working out shirtless under the sun as was his habit he never got more than even the slightest tan.  His blond hair was always looked messy, but Jen knew for a fact he spent an hour every morning making sure it was just the right kind of mess, and his eyes were the brightest blue Jen had ever seen.  It was generally agreed he was one of the best looking guys in school, everyone thought him timid and shy though, well at least when it came to girls.<br />
<br />
As Jen walked up Brad stepped aside to let her stand next to him, bending down for a quick kiss.  She felt an electric tingle pass through her at the touch.  It tickled the back of her mind for some reason, but she ignored it.  &quot;Thought you were going to skip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen laughed softly.  &quot;No, not today.  Got hung up, couldn't find my uniform this morning.&quot;  She turned and gave Alicia a quick hug, another tingle passing through her as their arms touched.  It made her mind spin for a moment again, making her frown for a quick moment. Static, that must be it, she had gotten her skirt right out of the dryer.  She gave Mark a slight smile and a nod.  Brad was the jealous type, and if she had done anymore he would have been staring at her like a hurt puppy for the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
They began chatting, the latest gossip and who did what.  They turned to get to the study hall, Jen's focus on the group so she didn't notice when she bumped into someone.  She turned ready to cuss out whatever stupid classmate had run into her but her mouth froze as she saw who it was.  Mr. Greene was one of the youngest teachers in the school, only 25.  Most of the girls fawned over him.  Where Mark had to style his hair, Mr. Greene's brown hair just seemed to naturally be that way, always the exact right amount of stubble was on his jaw.  He also sometimes used the school's weight room, and whenever he did a flock of girls always came to watch.  Supposedly he had been captain of the football team at this school when he attended, and he kept in shape, he had apparantly played a bit in college as well.  But when he stopped it didn't turn to fat like some ex-jocks, he kept himself well.  There was a rumor he had been offered a spot on a professional team, and no one knew why he turned it down.<br />
<br />
Jen quickly bent and picked up his briefcase, handing it to him.  He thanked her, showing twin rows of straight white teeth, his hand brushing hers as he took it from her.  Jen returned the smile, he was handsome, and a real man not like the guys in her class who were little more than grown boys.  When she turned back to the group Brad was giving her that look, he had seen how she smiled at him.  She opened her mouth to apologize but clamped it shut, he could just deal this time.  She strode ahead, her arm brushing Mark's as she pushed by him.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of her eye she could see one of the younger students moving by her.  He was bundled up in a jacket and gloves as if was about to snow.  It was the freak Kyle, but why was he tugging off one of his gloves.  He swept by her, his hand touching hers before he pulled the glove back on.  Suddenly everything came crashing back to her, the transform or dare.  That she even forgot was proof enough it was real, Kyle was the fifth!  He had taken the curse from her to be the next one, but why would he even want it?  A Rumbling in her stomach made he break that line of thought, it felt like her insides were rearranging.  Without another word she ran off.  She needed to get away from everyone before anything happened.  She tried to remember who she touched in what order, and which one meant which, but in her panic she couldn't think straight.<br />
<br />
She ducked into the staff bathroom, locking the door behind her.  Already her clothes were feeling too tight.  Her skimpy cheerleader outfit was straining against her growing body.  The skirt was digging into her waist.  She yanked it off and tossed it aside.  Her panties were straining against her sudden growth, and her shirt was tight across her shoulders making it hard to breathe.  With a pair of twin ripping noises both pieces of clothing fell to the floor in shreds.  She ran over to the mirror, kicking off her painfully small shoes as she did.  When she saw herself she gasped softly.  Her shoulders were definitely broader, in fact everything about her just seemed thicker, and taller.  As if she had been working out too much, too much muscle on her lean frame.  Her breasts were shrinking back into her chest, her large pert nipples becoming slowly smaller.<br />
<br />
A strange tingling between her legs drew her attention with a gasp.  Her clit looked swollen and was sticking out from her.  Even as she watched it it swelled longer and thicker taking on the familiar shape of a penis.  Her carefully shaved and now quite muscular legs were growing a sparse layer of dark hairs, her thickening arms were soon following.  Her breasts finally retreated fully into her chest, leaving a pair of firm pecs in their place.  Her flat stomach was becoming more defined as abs suddenly became apparent.  She felt a sudden yank between her legs as a pair of balls dropped down, making her grit her teeth.  In the mirror her face was changing, it was still obviously her, but things were off.  Her nose was stronger, her jaw a bit more squared, her brows a bit thicker.  Her blond hair was pulling back into her head to form a short buzz cut.<br />
<br />
More hair was growing around her crotch, a treasure trail growing up between her hard abs.  A light bit of hair grew between her pecs and around her nipples.  Her dick seemed to stop at a rather average size, and fr some reason that disappointed her.  The changes started to slow down.  Looking at herself in the mirror she looked like she could pass as her jock twin brother.  But.. she had touched Brad first.  The first was gender.  The next person she touched was..<br />
<br />
Alicia?  Even as the thought crossed her mind her skin began to darken.  Her carefully cultivated tan moving away from bronze towards brown.  Her hair on her head and body was turning pitch black, becoming thick and curly.  She watched in the mirror as he blue eyes turned brown, shading beneath brows that were getting a bit thicker.  Her nose was becoming broader and her lips more full.  While her skin mostly became a milk chocolate brown, her nipples and cock were almost black.  Her cock was also swelling, growing by a few inches, the flaccid five inch shaft now an amazing eight inches soft.  Even bigger than her boyfriend's.  Her hands and feet stretched larger as she gained a few more inches in height, well past six feet in height.<br />
<br />
With a shudder another set of changes overcame her.  Age.. which was Mr. Greene.  A few more inches were added to her height.  Her muscles bulging with added growth, veins popping along her arms and legs.  Her face became harder, loosing the look of youth it had as it became more masculine.  A harder jaw line with a thick layer of dark stubble.  Her body hair increased, only a bit more on her arms and legs, but the bit on her chest was spreading out, covering her two heavy pecs in a forest of curly black hair.  Once more the changes ground to a halt.  Jen looked in the mirror, only to see a twenty-six year old muscular black man looking back at her.<br />
<br />
Thoughts in her head started whirling.  She was going to get the sexual preferences of Mark then?  Well, he was Alicia's boyfriend so it couldn't be bad could it.  But thinking of the blond haired handsome teenager made Jen's thick cock stir, becoming a ten inch erect tool pointing right out from her crotch.  She gripped it with her large hand, stroking it as she imagined Mark sucking her off.  She tweaked her nipples with her other hand, bringing herself quickly to an orgasm.  with a loud grunt she covered the wall with load after load of creamy white cum, leaving her gasping.  No wonder Mark always seemed so timid around women.  Jen laughed, a deep echoing bass rumble in her chest.</p>
