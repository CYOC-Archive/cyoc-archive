<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer’s eyes were fixated on the picture in front of her. It was a very detailed picture of a cute devil girl with a long pointed tail. The girl’s feet were clawed like a tiger but with skin instead of fur and she seemed to not stand on her heels at all but rather the balls of her feet. All the devil girls nails were at least 3 inches long even the claws on her feet, and were deep obsidian black. Her skin was a Safire red and had a dull shine in the light of the picture. The girl had small bat wings with little spikes at the peak of the wings that were maybe a foot long she guessed based on the picture, with short black fur on the top and a darker tint of red skin  for the wing membrane. Other then the top of the girls head and the fur on her wings Jennifer could not see any other hair on the body. And finally Jennifer focused on the head of the girl. Jennifer noticed all the girls teeth were pointed, her eyes were yellow with black slits in them, and there were two large horns poking out of her head.the hair on her head was the same shade of black as the fur on her wings.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was stunned at what she saw she didn’t want this to be her. Looking at the rest of the picture it showed the devil girl cowering in fear of the people around her the little kids were throwing sticks and rocks at her while the older people just glared at her.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer was looking at the picture she noticed something. Her skin began to tingle, it started in her feet and moved up her body fast like a wave. She looked at her feet as saw red skin. The shade followed the tingling feeling all the way up tell her entire body was a deep red and her hair had completely darkened to a moonless night black.<br />
<br />
She grabbed a handful of hair and pulled it just to make sure it was real, it was. She began crying as she examined herself. Her skin was a hellish red and there wasn’t a thing she could do about it. She began feeling a pushing sensation at the tips of her fingers and toes. Looking at them she watched in horror as her nails grew and as they grew they turned blacker and blacker until they were a extremely dark black. Then her toe nails curled downwards into sharp claws growing thicker until they were almost raptor in appearance.<br />
Next she felt her leg muscles cramp up, no matter how much she massaged them the cramp just grew more painful tell she couldn't take it she had to stand on her tippy toes in order for the pain to stop. Once her feet were in position she heard cracking noises and felt huge waves of pain ripple through her feet almost causing her to lose her balance as the bones moved and reformed so her legs were stuck indefinitely like that, and they took on more of a paw like form.<br />
<br />
She began crying even harder because of the pain and her inability to lower her legs. She tried her hardest to put her heels on the ground to no avail. It was very uncomfortable for her the further she put her legs down. <br />
<br />
Her struggles with her new feet were short lived as another cramp formed at the base of her spine. Again the cramp was replaced with pain as she heard a ripping noise. It felt like she fell on a knife that cut into her tailbone and kept moving up and down. She fell onto the floor in pain squirming and digging her new claws into the tile ripping it apart as a new limb slowly and painfully slid out from her spine.<br />
The changes began moving faster as her shoulder blades cramped up. By now she wasn’t aware of where she was anymore because of all the pain.<br />
<br />
Finally the pain in her tailbone dulled, she reached back and felt the new limb behind her touching it sent a fast wave of pain though her body and she jerked her hand away looking at it her fingers were covered in a fine layer of blood. Closing her eyes wishing the pain would go away. The cramp in her shoulder blades grew stronger by the minute. She reached back and felt a small little spike poking through her skin. The pressure started to build and she let out a loud cry as the pressure released and her small wings burst fourth glistening with a layer of blood. The pain moved to her mouth she covered her mouth muffling her screams in pain as her teeth began getting pushed out of her mouth. Slowly her teeth fell out of her mouth and rested against her lips. She spit them out along with a mouthful of blood. New teeth began pushing through.by the time the pain subsided her mouth felt like the inside of a sharks mouth. All the pointed teeth almost sharp enough to cut her tongue as she felt them with it.<br />
<br />
The pain moved to her eyes and ears her ears just tingled for a couple seconds. Though that was of little concern to her as her eyes began throbbing. It felt like someone was squashing her eyes under a rock. Then as quickly as the pain came it was gone. Jennifer lay on the cold bloodied tiles in defeat. Sobbing at the small painful spasms her body had every couple seconds.<br />
<br />
Slowly a pressure built at her forehead she reached up and rubbed the spots and felt two small spikes pushing through. The pressure continued to grow and grow until Jennifer thought her head would explode. Then like popping a zit her horns burst out of her head spewing out a small jet of blood with them.<br />
The pain was to great she passed out shortly after her horns emerged.<br />
<br />
When she came to her body didn't hurt nearly as bad it was mainly focused on her wings and tail. She got off the floor and looked down at the dried blood all over the floor. She could feel the dried blood that covered her legs, back and head, she felt disgusting. She decided a shower would do her good and tried walking towards the bathroom. When her legs stopped responding to her commands and turned to the counter to pick up the note again.<br />
<br />
The last two instructions were:<br />
<br />
you will be seen as normal in this form, but that does not mean you will be treated the same. Some people will be scared of you, others that are into demons will respect you or want to be like you and want to hang out with you. Those that fear you will discriminate against you. There might be some other reactions but those are for the people themselves to decide.<br />
<br />
And finally you will go to the location on your collar. Where ever that is you will take the most popular route so people will see you. And that spot will be your new home. If someone lives there or owns the place you will be theirs, like a pet or a slave.<br />
Have a fun life Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt a pulling in her legs they wanted to go, and she guessed where they wanted to go. She did have some control over her legs though she thought she could just go to the location and be done with it. Or she could quickly take a shower before she goes.</p>
