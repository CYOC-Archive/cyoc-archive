<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With all international travel frozen, the Animalian colonies had to rely on internet and cell phones to keep in touch with each other. Some of the colonies were faring better than others. For instance, Maelewano was still having trouble with locusts. But mainly, it&#39;s the isolation that was starting to get to people, especially those trapped far from home. And also those far away from those they care about.<br />
<br />
Shuixing in particular was feeling very frustrated. Her spring plans have gone out the window because of this pandemic and it wasn&#39;t looking that summer was being more favorable. Heiya Island may not be a tiny island, but it was feeling more confined to her, especially since Nate wasn&#39;t there. She could still webchat with him, but somehow it didn&#39;t quite fill the gap completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...how are things on the island?&quot; asked Nate on their latest webchat session.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing really new,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;Everything&#39;s just the same, day after day. My sisters say I&#39;ve spend too much time on my computer. Muxing actually says I&#39;ve been going soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re just as hardcore as you ever were,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she means I&#39;m getting soft in the middle,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;Which I am certainly not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve been forgoing your training and exercise to spend time on the computer. Or gorging yourself with ice cream because I&#39;m not around,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have not been gorging on ice cream,&quot; said Shuixing in annoyance. She went through her tubs of ice cream at a moderate pace.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I&#39;m saying is that your life isn&#39;t meaningless without me,&quot; said Nate, &quot;You have your sisters with you and I have my family with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, how&#39;s your aunt and stepmom?&quot; asked Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Aunt Meryl and Uncle Olly aren&#39;t as noisy as they used to be. And Blueberry isn&#39;t my stepmom yet. The wedding&#39;s not until next month,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wish I could be there,&quot; said Shuixing, though the wedding was probably the least excuse for her wanting to be over there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope tensions will ease enough to allow travel by then,&quot; said Nate, &quot;At least for Animalians. You don&#39;t carry the corona virus like humans, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but it probably wouldn&#39;t a good idea to have people going back and forth,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;The problem is that this virus is asymptomatic that people could have it without realize it and carry it around infecting people who&#39;ll react much worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t apply to Animalians, right?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far, no. But people don&#39;t want to risk that,&quot; said Shuixing.<br />
<br />
Nate sighed before saying, &quot;We&#39;ll get together eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we will,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;And we&#39;ll have a lot to do until then.&quot; She was already thinking of how to convert Nate. With his father younger, he won&#39;t have to hand over the dairy farm for quite a long time. Not to mention with a new wife, Nate will probably soon have a half-sibling who can inherit the farm while Nate can be her mate. That was another reason Shuixing wanted to be at the wedding: she wanted to thank Blueberry for remaking Mr. Bowman&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Blueberry made her first move back on Valentine&#39;s Day. Not that she wasn&#39;t giving big hints about her feelings before, like the way she spent as much time around Ulysses as she could and how she often wore low-cut clothing. While it was very clear that she was flirting with her, it wasn&#39;t clear how serious she was until she came out and told Ulysses she love him. She made it clear it wasn&#39;t just gratitude or affection for being a good farmer. She knew that Ulysses had to deal with the hard task of raising both a dairy farm and a son by himself ever since his wife left him. Even with Meryl&#39;s help, it was such a burden on him, something he often told the cows back when he never thought they&#39;d really listened. But Blueberry did listen, even if it took the Animalian uplifting to make her fully understand. She knew Ulysses was a good man who deserved a better wife and she wanted to be that wife.<br />
<br />
Ulysses was flattered, but wasn&#39;t quite certain what to think of his former livestock falling in love with him. At least Blueberry gave him time to think it over. But then the pandemic started and people started leaving their houses less and less. Which gave Blueberry more time with Ulysses. Eventually, she won him over. Ulysses didn&#39;t deny that there was an ulterior motive of youth, strength, and the chance to father another son. But at least Nate approved of Blueberry and didn&#39;t seem upset about the possibility of losing his inheritance. But Ulysses knew Nate already had his heart set on Shuixing, so this arrangement worked out for everyone.<br />
<br />
It took a while to order and arrange the transport of the reactivation and vaccination shots for the Animalian virus, though Blueberry had a few other things to arrange. First of all, she had to get Meryl, Olly, and Nate out of the house for a while. For one thing, they were going to need Meryl&#39;s reinforced bed as Ulysses&#39;s current bed just wasn&#39;t strong enough for their needs. And obviously, Nate probably wouldn&#39;t want to hear what his father was getting up to.<br />
<br />
Ulysses knew what was up when he saw a box labeled from Horizon Labs with a note saying, &#39;Come upstairs&#39; taped to it. It looked like it was finally time. He went up the stairs and started towards his own bedroom. But then he heard mooing coming from Meryl&#39;s bedroom. A bit befuddled, Ulysses went over to that room. When he opened the door, he expected to see Blueberry waiting for him. He didn&#39;t expect to see the other three cows with her. Each one was wearing a set of lingerie that was colored after the berry they were named for. Blueberry and Strawberry were, obviously, wearing blue and red respectively. Blackberry was wearing a very dark purple. And Gooseberry (the odd one of the bunch, partially named for her habit of trying to get at people&#39;s back pockets) was wearing green.<br />
<br />
Ulysses lifted an eyebrow and asked, &quot;What&#39;s all this? I thought this was going to be just between us, Blueberry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all wanted to show our gratitude for what you&#39;ve done for us over the years,&quot; said Strawberry.<br />
<br />
&quot;And considering there&#39;s a lack of available bulls, Blueberry didn&#39;t mind sharing with you,&quot; said Blackberry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t expect you to be committed to them,&quot; said Blueberry, &quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to form a harem or herd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless the state of Wisconsin allows for polygamy,&quot; said Gooseberry, only for her to get elbowed in the boob.<br />
<br />
Ulysses walked into the room and said, &quot;So where do we get started?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blueberry walked up to Ulysses until her very large breasts were right in his face. &quot;We start with you milking my udders,&quot; she said in a sultry tone. She pulled up her bra, allowing her leaking nipples out. Very soon, Ulysses had his mouth over one, drinking quite a lot of milk from her. The other cows soon crowded around them, occasionally pulling up Ulysses&#39;s head to make him latch onto another teat.<br />
<br />
Their milk quickly had an effect on Ulysses. His body started growing larger, starting to strain his old work clothes. Youth he hadn&#39;t felt in years flooded his veins while his muscles filled with more strength than he ever felt. His clothes were soon ripping up from the increased bulk he was putting on, aided by the eager cows who wanted to see more of his increasingly bovine body. Ulysses nearly stumbled as his feet became too uncomfortable for his boots. The cows were eager to help him out of them and massage his feet as they transitioned into hooves. His pants were already off when his tail grew out. Blueberry was licking and kissing his face as it pushed out into a muzzle, a pair of horns parting out through his hair.<br />
<br />
When his transformation ended, Ulysses was now taller than the cows, which put him quite above the average human in height. A look in the mirror showed how much he had changed. As a bull, Ulysses&#39;s fur was a darker brown than the cows. He was very well-toned now, but he wasn&#39;t as massive as the Belgian Blues back in Animalia. It made sense as the Belgian Blues were raised for beef and the Brown Swiss were dairy cows. Even so, Ulysses was hardly small when compared to humans and there was nothing small about the large bullhood he was now sporting or the heavy balls beneath it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s what I call a calf-raiser,&quot; said Gooseberry as she stroked Ulysses&#39;s shaft. He let out a small low at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say he has real brass balls now,&quot; said Blackberry as she fondled Ulysses&#39;s sack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, girls, we can all have a turn, but I think Blueberry is first,&quot; said Strawberry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn straight,&quot; said Blueberry as they pushed Ulysses over to the bed. As soon as he was lying on it, Blueberry crawled on top of him. She perched just below his mighty cock. &quot;So what do you say, stud?&quot; asked Blueberry, &quot;Care to take this cowgirl for a ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re getting your terms mixed up,&quot; said Ulysses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t spoil this,&quot; said Blueberry flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, saddle up,&quot; said Ulysses.<br />
<br />
Blueberry rolled her eyes. It really has been too long since he&#39;s been with a woman. His pillow talk really needed work. But as she slid herself over his shaft, she could tell there was nothing wrong with his dick. Blueberry soon started bouncing, allowing her tits to bounce around. Ulysses grabbed the teats and gave them a yank. Blueberry mooed in pleasure as milk sprayed out, she was far from empty. The other cows started crowding in, giving the bull some tits to suckle or a pussy to lick. Fortunate for them, Ulysses&#39;s bull balls weren&#39;t so easily emptied either. It was going to be a very long night for the new breeding bull.</p>
