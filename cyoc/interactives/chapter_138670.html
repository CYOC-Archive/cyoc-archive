<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas was enjoying his thumb when he felt a warmness on the front of his crotch. Pulling the sodden digit from his mouth he looked down to see a growing yellow stain on the front of his diaper, realizing he was peeing himself. He didn’t even feel the need until he started going which meant his potty training was indeed gone now, a fact he found most pleasing. Thomas grinned as the warm steady stream continuously hit the inside of his padding turning it puffy and causing it to sag a little.<br />
<br />
Looking over at Dr. Issacs and Sarah he saw the two grown ups were too busy talking to each other to notice he was wetting himself right in front of them.<br />
<br />
He was about to call attention to what he was doing when Thomas felt a churning in his stomach, a familiar pressure building in his rear. His grin widened at knowing what he needed to do now and prepared to cement his new role as a baby by pooping his pants like one. Balling his tiny fists his young body instinctively moved of its own accord as he bent his knees and squatted down a little. With a soft grunt and a slight push he let out a loud muffled fart as he passed a huge log, the brown solid dropping into the awaiting seat. Thomas moaned happily as with a few more tiny farts he pushed out two more smaller solids, loving the crinkling the garment made as it stretched and expanded to contain his number two. Grinning from ear to ear he relished the simple fact that he was currently using his pants as a toilet, loving the freedom and convenience his padded underwear provided him as he messed himself with the reckless abandon of a toddler. Throughout the whole thing his padding held strong and kept everything inside.<br />
<br />
When he finished he stood up straight and marveled at how nice and full and heavy the back of his diaper now felt after unloading what felt like at least a pound of poo into it, the seat even sagging a little under the weight.<br />
<br />
He then looked up and saw Dr. Issacs and Sarah looking back at him with knowing smiles on their faces, the two having heard his first gassy release and saw him going potty. Thomas lightly blushed but still felt really good about what he just did, even feeling a sense of pride at his ‘accomplishment’.<br />
<br />
The only one who wasn’t fine with what happened was Luis who because of his unfortunate position had a great view of Thomas pooping. If he had been able to move his eyelids they would have widen upon seeing the man turned toddler squat down and take a big dump in his diaper without any shame at all. He could also plainly see the back pushing out into a large noticeable bulge, a sure sign the kid needed changing. If Luis hadn’t seen the regression with his own eyes he would have sworn the little boy standing on the table across from him was a real baby and not an adult in a baby’s body.<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to say Thomas continued to just stand there silently in his well used padding, awkwardly shifting his feet until the silence was broken by the only woman in the room.<br />
<br />
“Awww…did someone just go and make their first boom boom as a toddler?” Sarah playfully teased knowing he liked the baby talk.<br />
<br />
His cheeks turned a faint red as he was talked down to like a little boy, making him feel even more like his new age.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh and it’s a really big one too!” Thomas bashfully replied with proud enthusiasm that came out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
“Well to be honest I’m not too surprised this happened, after all we did have a big lunch before we came here” Sarah admitted thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
“Actually, it’s not uncommon for clients who regress past 5 to experience some sort of bladder release or bowel movement since those parts of the body shrink considerably during the regression process. That’s why I suggested getting him some protection right away” the doc explained to the both of them.<br />
<br />
It was at that very moment a certain scent crossed the toddler’s nose and he quickly realized that it was coming from him, or rather his rear end. Apparently the poopie (and he loved being able to say that) he had just made was so big that the smell was beginning to leak out despite the built-in odor guards. He did end up giggling at Dr. Issacs and Sarah whose faces scrunched up at catching a whiff of his massive load.<br />
<br />
“Alright Mister Stinky Butt, you need a fresh diaper and pronto” Sarah said as she grabbed ahold of the 18 month old under his armpits and gently laid him back down on the table.<br />
<br />
“Good thing you were already on a table” she commented as she pulled the changings supplies she had brought along from her bag, laying them out along with one of their three remaining spare diapers.<br />
<br />
Realizing he was about to experience his first change as an actual baby Thomas beamed with absolute joy knowing that someone else was going to take care of the mess he made.<br />
<br />
Once she had everything ready Sarah reached down and began untaping the adhesive tabs on either side of the dirty diaper. Pulling down the front revealed his wet stinky mess along with a wave of stink that rose up, Thomas eagerly taking it in while the adults covered their noses at the horrendous stench.<br />
<br />
“Phew, who knew you were such a stinky baby Thomas” she commented as she opened up a package of baby wipes to which Thomas responded with a giggle.<br />
<br />
Luis was likewise appalled being forced to breath in the faint smell of the baby boy’s poop which had spread to the other side of the room. Also since he couldn’t turn away or close his eyes being paralyzed and all when the garment was opened up and thus saw the man baby’s pile of brown turds, grossed out by the sight. Suddenly he wished he hadn’t tried moving his head and was still staring up at the ceiling. Luis was very grateful when the woman removed the soiled diaper and moved it off to the side, leaving it open and turning it so that the poop was no longer visible to him. He then inwardly groaned as he realized he would still end up having to watch the rest of the toddler’s change.<br />
<br />
Thomas on the other hand was having the time of his life.<br />
<br />
The moment the moist wipes made contact with his bare bottom he was in total heaven as Sarah gently and thoroughly wiped his butt. Embracing his baby side he began to giggle and squirm as he was cleaned of his poo, enjoying the moment for all it was worth. Thomas especially liked when she did in between his legs, going over his tiny penis and balls with utmost care. After getting every nook and cranny she quickly disposed of the soiled wipes inside his old padding before moving onto the next step.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the bottle and tilting it sideways Sarah began to sprinkle his rear and crotch with a light coating of powder, the sweet smell quickly getting rid of the other smell he had previously made. She then pulled a brand new diaper from the bag and lifting his chubby legs, unfolding it and slipped it under his clean bottom. Thomas smiled as he was swiftly taped up in the fresh pair of padding, looking down to see his underwear was naturally decorated with images of sesame street characters as it was a Pampers brand. Feeling so content and at peace in that moment he just laid back stretching out his arms and spreading his legs wide, basking in the afterglow of an amazing change.<br />
<br />
Sarah gave a small smile at the cute sight of baby Thomas lying there in just his diaper.<br />
<br />
Remembering the messy one still lying open on the table Sarah grabbed it and swiftly wrapped it up into a ball for disposal.<br />
<br />
“Is there someplace I can throw this away in?” she asked Dr. Issacs, having noticed there wasn’t a trash can anywhere in the room.<br />
<br />
“There’s a garbage chute right over there that’s built into the wall. Just pull down the handle and you can toss it in” he said pointing to it.<br />
<br />
She nodded appreciatively and began walking over to the designated spot. <br />
<br />
The freshly changed Thomas having overhead them then eagerly sat up and sitting on his crinkly padded bottom watched as Sarah opened the chute and threw away his poop before returning to the table.<br />
<br />
Now with that mess literally taken care up Dr. Issacs immediately returned to the topic of his release as Sarah busied herself putting the wipes and powder back in the bag.<br />
<br />
“Well Thomas I can see you are satisfied with your treatment” he said reaching out to shake the young boy’s tiny hand.<br />
<br />
“Very much” Thomas smiled showing off his baby teeth.<br />
<br />
“I trust that you’ll consider coming back for another one in the near future” Dr. Issacs asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh I definitely will”<br />
<br />
At this point Sarah took over speaking for him.<br />
<br />
“Thomas here plans on coming back for another regression session when he turns 5. He intends to use his fortune to stay young for as long as he can” she explained as she gave the little boy a look then fake groaned, “Which unfortunately means I’ll be changing his diapers for quite a long time.”<br />
<br />
“Yay, that means I don’t gotta use the big boy potty anymore” Thomas said with a grin, having felt that weird rush of excitement again as he patted the front of his padding happily.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled and played along, “That’s right Thomas cause you’re now wearing your potty” she said giving the young toddler a quick tickle on the stomach which made him giggle.<br />
<br />
“It’s my diaper! I go potty in that now” Thomas answered.<br />
<br />
“Correct again, such a smart little boy you are” she complimented.<br />
<br />
Dr. Issacs then awkwardly cleared his throat bringing both of their attention back to him.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s all good to hear and it sounds like a great long term plan you got there. We here at ReGenesis always love to have repeat business” he chuckled mirthfully.<br />
<br />
Sarah gave a small nod before taking out a small t-shirt, shorts and a pair of shoes from her bag, quickly dressing Thomas in all three before picking up the baby boy and setting him down on the floor. Moving around the room he quickly got used to his smaller younger legs, letting off some of his newfound energy before scampering over to obediently stand beside her.<br />
<br />
Both Thomas and Sarah exchanged a few more words before bidding each other goodbye, the latter taking the former by the hand and leading the toddler to the door.<br />
<br />
He turned and gave the doc a smile and a friendly wave before leaving which the man returned.<br />
<br />
Once the two of them had left the room Dr. Issacs was able to turn his attention to the old frail looking man lying on the other table, the smile disappearing from his face as he frowned. He swiftly walked over to Luis and check to make sure he was still alive and that the paralysis was still in effect. After confirming both he paged one of the nurses to come and take Mr. Martinez back to his holding cell in the basement level. He watched the young woman wheel the man out of the room on a gurney, not feeling the least bit of sympathy for the convict’s state of being. Even if what they were doing with these prisoners was considered illegal Dr. Issacs saw it as the opposite, that they were giving these people the punishment they deserve and at the same time bettering other people’s lives.<br />
<br />
He paused for a moment to glance around the room before shoving hands in the pockets of his lab coat, walking out the door and locking it before heading to his next appointment.</p>
