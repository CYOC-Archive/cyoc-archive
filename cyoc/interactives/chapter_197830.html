<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What are you talking about?” Darren asked as he stood there in the hallway, shirtless.<br />
<br />
“That!” Andrew shouted again, pointing to Darren’s slightly distended abdomen. The big man looked down, his eyes widening in shock as he beheld his rotund belly. <br />
<br />
“What the hell happened to my abs, I…oh,” he groaned as he felt something jerk inside of him. He stumbled into the living room and lightly planted himself onto the couch, a big hand cradling his bloated midriff. “Oh my god, dude, what happened to me?”<br />
<br />
“Darren, I think you’re pregnant!” Andrew exclaimed as he watched Darren wince and grunt on the couch. <br />
<br />
Darren would have Charlie-horsed Andrew right there if he weren’t so distracted by the alien sensations churning near his pelvis. “What? I’m a man, men don’t get pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“Can I feel?” Andrew asked, as he watched the big man lean bag against the sofa. Despite his heavy belly, Darren looked more or less the same. His face seemed a little hairier than Andrew remembered it being this morning, but in contrast most of the hair on Darren’s chest and belly had disappeared. <br />
<br />
“No, that’s gay, man,” Darren grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you could be having an actual problem. We might need to go to the hospital, so let me feel your belly.” Andrew demanded, growing concerned. <br />
<br />
Darren huffed. “Fine, you know you always wanted to feel ‘em anyway,” he said, trying to preserve the last of his masculine bravado.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be a dick,” Andrew said, moving closer and reaching out to feel Darren’s belly. It was warm, soft but also firm. Andrew didn’t know what to feel for, but nothing alarming stuck out to him until he felt a jerk against his fingers from within Darren’s inflated belly. He jerked his hand back.<br />
<br />
“Darren, you don’t feel that?” Andrew asked, reaching over to feel his stomach again. “That’s a kick!”<br />
<br />
“I know,” he groaned, and when Andrew looked up at him he was surprised to see the big man’s man was on the verge of tears. “What the hell happened to me man? I literally just got back from the gym and now I’m…” He stumbled for the word before blurted out, “I’ve never even fucked a guy!”<br />
<br />
In a moment of levity, Andrew arched his eyebrow and looked Darren dead in the eye. “Really?”<br />
<br />
“Swear to god! Thank god, I think its stopping.” He rubbed his belly.<br />
<br />
“You okay?” Andrew asked, after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” said Darren. “It actually feels kind of…good.”<br />
<br />
“You checked the goods yet?” Andrew asked, the thought suddenly occurring to him. When Darren gave him a questioning look, Andrew pointed to his crotch and the man’s eyes went wide again. He pulled away his towel, paying no mind to Andrew’s protests, and reached between his legs and was relieved to find his soft cock and balls resting between his legs. However, something about them felt a little off, almost as if they were smaller than they had been before.<br />
<br />
“Glad to see you’re intact, buddy. Now can you cover up?” Andrew asked, still looking away?<br />
<br />
Darren chuckled, figuring it was just shrinkage. “Sorry. I had to be sure.” He may be pregnant, but at least he was still a man where it counted, he rationalized to himself.<br />
<br />
“Its gotta be that damned mirror,” Andrew said. “On the phone today my mom was talking about a nursery. Then my girlfriend mentions how my mom is supposedly four months pregnant. And now this!” Andrew gestured towards Darren.<br />
<br />
“I know I’m a…pregnant man,” Darren began, “But magic ain’t real.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you just said that in the same sentence as, ‘I’m a pregnant man’.”<br />
<br />
“Well then you go and stand in front of it!”<br />
<br />
“I did! And I didn’t end up pregnant!” Andrew retorted, throwing his arms up. The motion made the pendent around his neck shake, reminding him of its presence. “And I was wearing this,” He said, fingering the chain.<br />
<br />
“I was gonna ask about that gaudy thing,” Darren said, grunting as he pushed himself up from the couch. <br />
<br />
“Where are you going?”<br />
<br />
“To the bathroom. Guess I better get used to this,” He chuckled dryly as he stumbled back to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Wait, take this!” Andrew said, removing the necklace and holding it out in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Why?” Darren said, turning around and arching an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I dunno. Maybe it protects you, or something,” Andrew said, feeling foolish.<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should get rid of that creepy mirror altogether.” Darren said, taking the necklace and placing it around his neck. He blinked a few times as his vision seemed to lose focus for a second. “But I have to pee too bad to argue.” He finished before leaving for the bathroom and closing the door behind him. <br />
<br />
After Darren was finished, Andrew felt the need himself and made for the restroom. Darren quickly left the bathroom and went into his room to sulk, closing the door behind him. Andrew peered hesitated for a moment before stepping into the bathroom, peering into his own reflection in the strange mirror. What he saw reflected back surprised him. <br />
<br />
It was still him, but Andrew’s reflection was very different from what he thought he looked like just a moment ago, and he wasn’t pregnant either. His plain t-shirt strained against his well-defined chest muscles and thick biceps. His arms were noticeably more hairy, as was the rest of his body; dark curly hairs crept up almost to his neck, and the rest of his skin felt strangely itchy. His face still bore the same distinguishing features, but his jaw was broader, more angular, and adorned with a thick and well-manicured beard. Andrew away from his reflection and at his own body, letting out a gasp when he looked down to see his muscled chest and sinewy arms. He lifted up his shirt and was taken aback by the firm, muscled, hairy belly that was hidden beneath. Looking back to his reflection, Andrew couldn’t help but appreciate how masculine-looking he had suddenly become. His admiration of himself created some stirring down below, and Andrew’s attention shifted to the thick bulge straining against the front of his jeans. His larger and calloused fingers shaking with excitement, Andrew fumbled with his belt and unzipped his jeans before pulling them and his underwear down.<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Andrew said aloud, his new, deeper voice surprising him as he admired his newly endowed manhood. His normally above average cock had grown by more than a few inches in length and girth, and his balls had grown to match. They were low hanging, heavy, and each one the size of a lemon. Andrew was only semi-hard, but his heavy cock lurked from his bushy crotch a good seven inches already. He reached down to take hold of it, letting loose a deep groan as he felt the warm, heavy length between his fingers. It was so much thicker, he realized, as it grew in his hand. Andrew gave it a few experimental strokes and quickly brought himself to full erection. At full length, his new cock was almost ten inches long, and over six inches in girth, but in Andrew’s inexperienced hands it felt a mile long. This thing is straight-up a baby-maker, he thought to himself. That last thought gave him pause enough to stop stroking his big dick. The mirror had made Darren pregnant just moments ago, and now here Andrew was, a paragon of masculine virility. He was starting to get an idea of who the father of Darren’s baby might be…<br />
