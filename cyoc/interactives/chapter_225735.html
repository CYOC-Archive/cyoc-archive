<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The chief is a large and intimidating man. From what you could gather, most male orcs were around 7 foot or taller while female orcs were around 6 foot. The chief is nearly 9 feet tall with an impressive body to match. His entire body is covered in muscles, bulges in nearly every area, with a physique that could make the bodybuilders back in your own world cry tears of shame. It’s as if he was the definition of muscle with the girth, strength, and power he encompassed throughout his body. His arms and legs were as wide as tree trunks with his chest as strong as metal, an intricate tattoo running across his right shoulder to his forearm.<br />
<br />
The chief has long gray hair combed back and placed into a bun and tied with a strong leather band, thick locks of hair hanging around his neck, He has a trimmed black chin strap beard with flecks of gray scattered throughout, showing his age but also his strength: being able to survive long enough to reach this point of his lifespan. <br />
<br />
His blue eyes resembled those of blue flames, the most radiant and strongest of the fire’s colors and also the most passionate. They held the priority of the tribe above all else, even his own life.<br />
<br />
The chief’s eyebrows were sleek and thick, captivating and expressing his emotions easily. He had a thick silver ring in his jagged nose. Perhaps the result of past injuries to the face. A long vertical scar ran from the middle of his forehead to his cheek, going over his left eye. Yet his eye remained fine, surviving whatever gave him the mark.<br />
<br />
He wore a necklace with an assortment of teeth, string, and beads. Small golden skulls scattered throughout. In the center laid a large metal emblem of a wolf, representing their companions, their spirit, and the symbol of the tribe.<br />
<br />
He carried the pelt of a white bear on his back, never daring once to think of making one out of a wolf. A pauldron made of the finest metals hung over his left shoulder with leather bands wrapped around his left bicep. A strap from the pauldron ran over his chest and met his belt at his right hip. He carried fingerless armored gloves with him with a similar set of armored boots on his feet.<br />
<br />
His loincloth was made of a strong brown texture, derived from a tough and valuable animal, that provided the proper flexibility and endurance needed for a warrior. A belt made of the same material wrapped around his waist with a iron diamond-shaped badge in the middle. Despite looking as if he was ready for battle, the chief was actually wearing his casual wear.<br />
<br />
Looking at the chief left you mesmerized in admiration and shame. Suddenly, you felt even more embarrassed at wearing too little in spite of being clothed with a loincloth.<br />
<br />
“Warriors.” The orc finally speaks. His voice is authoritative and commanding. Sending out vibrations of a baritone voice, so deep, that it should be classified in its own league.<br />
<br />
“We have finished another successful raid and acquired plenty of valuables and assets. Ones that will provide us support in our future conquests.”<br />
<br />
A roar of congruent yells roam throughout the tent, full of bloodlust and emotions of pride. They synchronized with one another as they fill the tent before the chief holds his hand up. Instantaneously, the noises cease.<br />
<br />
You’re surprised to see what’s going on around you. All of these orcs seem to be at the call of their chief and you could understand why. The chief simply resonated the aura of a leader. Someone you just had to comply to. Even YOU felt ready to submit to him.<br />
<br />
Glancing around you, you hoped no one had seen you not yelling and joining in their cries. That felt a bit too much for you (although a small part of you felt like joining in). But it appeared that all the orcs had been so engrossed in their war cry that none had noticed your lack of participation. <br />
<br />
Even the friendly Kagan and the serious Lurog had joined the other orcs, as if their instincts told them to respond and react, and let out their own loud bellows.<br />
<br />
“Although we mustn’t diminish our attention from our goals and lower our guards, a milestone this lucrative merits a reward,” he begins, “we will use the day to scout ahead, prepare ourselves, and understand our surroundings. Once we finish we may enjoy the night. For tonight… WE FEAST!”<br />
<br />
The war cry begins again and resonates louder than before, if such a thing was possible, before the chief stops it once more. He holds up the flagpole he’s been holding in his left hand and raises it. A grey flag waves in the air, a logo comprised of a wolf and an orc in the center. The chief alludes a farewell before leaving the stage.<br />
<br />
Once he exits the tent a commotion erupts as orcs begin to boisterously converse and rapidly make their way to the exit. You suddenly find yourself being pushed from behind by a large group of orcs and believe you’re about to be crushed. Was this really how it was going to end? Trampled by orcs?<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing Boruk?” A voice says.<br />
<br />
A strong hand grips your right hand and with a  powerful tug you find yourself quickly pulled ahead.<br />
<br />
Light hits your eyes as you exit the tent, Kagan being the individual having dragged you out. Lurog is already in front of you two, having dashed out of the tent the second after the chief left, and walking away. Kagan lets go of your hand as you feel yourself at a loss from being saved by an orc.<br />
<br />
“Being last does have certain advantages,” Kagan says proudly with a charming smile before joining Lurog in leaving. You look behind you at the rush of orcs exiting the Grand Hall and at your hand before running up to catch to the two.<br />
<br />
***<br />
“So you two are roommates!” you exclaim in surprise. The revelation bringing you to a shock.<br />
<br />
“Yep. Me and Lurog here have been in the same hut for years,” Kagan says as he stretches himself. He has to be careful not to hit the roof but manages it easily as he stretches his arms.<br />
<br />
“Feels like eons to me,” Lurog says with a annoyed expression. Kagan turns to look at him and laughs.<br />
<br />
You’re just as surprised that the three of you had been able to fit in the temple. You all sit cross legged on the floor, attempting to take as little space as possible in the room. However, three large orcs and one small room didn’t exactly equal the most comfortable conditions.<br />
<br />
You’d only suggested it to them after meeting back up with them and hearing Kagan’s request to find a secluded and new location to relax in.<br />
<br />
It was far from cozy but Kagan didn’t seem to mind. He was happy to be somewhere different that his regular hut. And with the door shut, the three had all the privacy they needed.<br />
<br />
“Wish I had somewhere to stay…” you say absentmindedly. Realizing you would be lacking a hut to stay in when night came.<br />
<br />
“Really? We’ve been looking for another member to join our hut for a while.” Kagan tells you happily.<br />
<br />
“Huh- wai… what?” you stutter, realizing you had accidentally told them something confidential. How would you explain this?<br />
<br />
“Did you forget your hut when we left the campsite yesterday?” Lurog questions you and gestures to Kagan with his thumb. “You don’t know how many times this idiot almost did the same.”<br />
<br />
“Hey! I apologized.” Kagan says with fake offense.<br />
<br />
“Only the first time. I gave you ten chances to pack up our belongings and you forgot the hut every single time. Fortunately I knew you’d always fail and left the site last to recover our hut.”<br />
<br />
The two began to wildly chatter as you breathed a sigh of relief. You’d been really lucky to have found them. You liked these two orcs. They seemed to be more carefree and easygoing than the others. All of the other orcs gave you threatening vibes with their neutral states. Never knowing what they were thinking. Questioning if they were going to flip out on you or abandon you at any moment from any mistake you’d make with your strange un-orclike behavior.<br />
<br />
But Kagan and Lurog were straightforward and honest with you about everything. And they just saw you as a regular orc. Maybe a tad different but still an orc.<br />
<br />
It also helped that they were both friendly to you in their own ways.<br />
<br />
“Do I really trust these orcs?” you wonder.<br />
<br />
It had only been a day since you arrived to this realm and transformed into an orc. You still didn’t know anything about this world. And orcs didn’t seem to be most kind and reliable people to surround yourself with. Yet… you felt yourself relaxing around these two in spite of telling yourself not to.<br />
<br />
“So what do you think? Do you want to room with us?” Kagan asks you. “No one ever wants to join our hut.”<br />
<br />
“Sure. Sounds good!” you respond with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
“Great. Now that that’s settled we better get a move on.” Kagan stands up slowly as his head makes its way to the top of the ceiling. He has to crank his head to one side to properly stand all the way up.<br />
<br />
“Where are we going?” you ask him.</p>
