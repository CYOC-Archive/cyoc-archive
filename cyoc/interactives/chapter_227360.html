<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christina was separating her clothes out onto her bed for the Goodwill people when there was a knock at the door. Standing before her was a tall man in his mid 50s in a camo army uniform. She/he reminded the man of a young Keri Russell or various soap star actresses his wife liked to watch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Christian Harris? My name is Colonel Bill Pitts.&quot; The man stuck out his hand and practically grabbed Christina&#39;s before entering without being asked. He must have been the guy that Grandpa had hired, she thought glumly and a bit in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Christina.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Christina is not a MAN&#39;S NAME. You have entered SECOND PUBERTY,&quot; the man announced, his words loud and practically bellowing. His forcefulness was obvious and it intimidated Christina. Colonel Bill Pitts looked like the epitomy of a man. He was always scowling, and he was at least 6&#39;3&quot;. He had a craggy face like Clint Eastwood or that gay porn star her gay friend Jack liked. What was his name? Cole Tucker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...look...I don&#39;t  know what my grandfather told you but...I&#39;m going through a lot of adjustment right now and my therapist thinks that this whole thing might need...I ..I think I need some time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, you do not have the LUXURY of time. You are going to be seen and treated as a grown man in American society within just a few short months whether you LIKE IT OR NOT. Are you planning on taking these with you, son? I hope not,&quot; Colonel Bill said, grabbing some pink panties. &quot;Oh boy, those smell real nice. Bet they make you horny for some pussy, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how to respond to that comment,&quot; Christian replied. &quot;I still look like a girl. I wasn&#39;t sure what I would still need and I&#39;m taking the rest to Goodwill and...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Chuck it all. Every last vestige of your previous life is going to go out. Now start packing your bags. Your grandfather gave you male clothing and grooming equipment. You will be ready at 1400 hours to depart from this dorm room and you had better not give me any lip about a therapist again. We have therapists at Camp Sawdust-Grit and they&#39;re a hell of a lot more equipped to help you than some nampy pampy old woman who likes to talk to you about taking your time. She hasn&#39;t been through Second Puberty and the counselors at our camp have been. Half the men at Camp Sawdust Grit have been female in their previous lives, which they have utterly discarded. They will motivate you to embrace everything masculine and leave everything feminine at the door. If you need someone to throw the rest of your things out, I can arrange someone to come by later. I will be outside waiting for you. I am under explicit orders to make sure you don&#39;t plan to do anything stupid like make a run for it. And change out of that outfit and into some decent clothes. You will not set foot into a vehicle with me in that pink little getup and lavender skirt. Your grandfather bought you decent clothes and you will wear them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how do you know? How do you know that this is what I need? I mean, look at me! I&#39;m a girl and that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever known. I don&#39;t look like a guy at all yet. Shouldn&#39;t I enjoy it while it lasts?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, that will only do more harm than good, believe you me. You need to prepare for the future, not the past! NOW GET GOING. GET YOUR ASS MOVING. GO! GO! GO! GO! HOO HAH! YOU GET YOUR ASS OUTSIDE WITH THOSE BAGS PACKED IN ONE HOUR, DO YOU HEAR ME SOLDIER!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU RESPOND BY SAYING YES, SIR OR YES, COLONEL!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; Christian blinked. He hurried to get everything in his suitcases. No makeup, he thought glumly. He still looked like a girl. Beautiful long hair and earrings, a necklace...did he have to give up all the jewelry as well? He would have to ask. All my golden hair, he thought miserably. All my tresses. All my dresses. All my bras and all my dreams of having a daughter to do makeup with some day...<br />
<br />
Christian didn&#39;t even fight the name change. He just accepted it. He put on a blue and white plaid shirt and jeans. <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, what the hell are you wearing?&quot; he asked the college girl who entered the jeep his grandfather had provided for him. The Colonel told him he&#39;d be driving it all the way to the Camp, so they were in for a long ten hour drive. <br />
<br />
&quot;What/&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Men don&#39;t wear sparkling earrings, son. Hand em&#39; over.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. They were expensive so I kept them and all the jewelry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We always return jewelry to the family. Should have told you that before,&quot; the Colonel said, putting a cigar in his mouth. He started up the Jeep. &quot;We&#39;ll send them all back to your mother. Don&#39;t you worry, you&#39;re not gonna miss em;&#39; at all by the end of summer.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you...have to smoke that thing right next to me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, I smoke cigars where I want and I like to smoke cigars when I drive. You&#39;ll get used to cigar smoke. Smells good on a young man like you. Just wait until you try one out when your new body comes in.&quot; <br />
<br />
The rest of the drive was fairly uneventful. The Colonel made Christian wipe off the makeup he&#39;d applied that morning. When they stopped at a gas station, the Colonel warned him that this would be the last time he used a women&#39;s bathroom...ever. <br />
<br />
The Colonel popped in tape after tape of army band music and WW2 podcasts for the new yountg man to absorb. <br />
<br />
&quot;My grandfather...wants me to join the military, but...it&#39;s not something I ever considered,&quot; she admitted to Colonel Pitts. &quot;I just...never saw myself that way. I thought I might marry a military man.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;ll have a wife someday that can appreciate how far you&#39;ve come in being a military man. It&#39;s all right. Just worry about fitting in. Do everything we tell you to do and we will guarantee you a successful career as a man. We have a VERY high success rate here. Most camps try to use the soft touch and we don&#39;t. You&#39;re probably thinking to yourself, hell, what have I gotten myself into? Well, mister, I&#39;ll tell you what. Our recruits have gone on to CEO positions. They&#39;ve gone on to hold political office. Some are in professional sports. Military bases all over the world have our former graduates. Not to mention doctors, scientists, lawyers, all respected in their fields. And they don&#39;t have to worry about getting pregnant or their biological clocks running out of time. You can concentrate on what you were born to. Becoming the leader of your family unit. Men are leaders. Women are usually followers. Now I know what you&#39;re gonna say, women are in the military blah blah blah. Well most of them are dykes, I hate to break it to ya. And most of the straight ones aren&#39;t gonna stay more than four years and they just want to show it off on their resumes, get into good colleges, etcetera. You, on the other hand,&quot; he puffed cigar smoke the entire time he was talking, &quot;are on your way to greatness. WIth a family like yours and the connections they have, your career is going to go places you never dreamed imaginable when you were on the path to mommyhood.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So doesn&#39;t that say something about how sexist our society is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck no!&quot; Bill dismissed. &quot;First thing you gotta learn about being a man. No one should force us to give up the roles God gave us. Women are not the providers and it&#39;s foolish to force them to be. Society has gone haywire. Second Puberty is probably a way of telling us that we should adhere to gender norms no matter what. You ever hear about the cases that can&#39;t handle it? The women that can&#39;t handle being men and try to hold onto their feminine side? A six foot six man holding onto a purse is a fucking joke and you know it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is...so transphobic.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s realistic. You ever see a woman wearing carpenter jeans and trying to keep her hair buzzed? Covered with tattoos? How is she ever going to find a good husband? How is that six foot six man in a dress not going to be a joke to everyone? Do you want to be a fucking freak or do you want to be a functioning adult? You don&#39;t even need to answer that question. I know the answer.&quot; <br />
<br />
He smoked cigars on purpose, she found out later. He was trying to set an example for Christian. He did it with all the new recruits, they told him later. Smoked in the car on purpose to get new men to be used to the smell. <br />
<br />
They arrived at nearly midnight. Christian was given a room and told to be ready at 0600 hours, which gave him little time to crash and sleep. It was hard to fall asleep. He had so much anxiety. He looked like a CW actress and soon he was going to look like...what...his father? How tall would he even grow? What would he even say to people the next day?<br />
<br />
Bleary eyed, Christian woke up to the sound of pounding on the door and a man at the door told her to get dressed and come outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re late, recruit! When you are told to be ready at ZERO SIX HUNDRED HOURS, then you will be ready at ZERO SIX HUNDRED HOURS. DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN OR YOU WILL FACE PUNISHMENT.&quot; <br />
<br />
Christian swallowed his shock. They drove him to get his hair shaved. Others were there in line. Some of the women looked taller and stockier already. Some of them had stubble growing in. All of them had long hair. Some of them cried as it got shaved off and the got yelled at by the staff. Christina steeled herself to say goodbye to it and soon it was all on the floor. She now had a crew cut. <br />
<br />
Breakfast in the mess hall was next. The room was filled with what looked like women with muscles, women who were tall and swarthy and muscular, or men that looked slightly effeminate still either with their posture, hips, lips, eyes, ears, etc. As you went from left to right, the room became more masculine in appearance until you got to the rows of fully transitioned males who looked like full men. They were...some of them were average sized but they all had stubble and didn&#39;t look like women at all. Some of them were quite large and Christian couldn&#39;t believe that any woman could grow that big in just a few short months...<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t say much to his new companions. They were all in shock. There was one talkative chick who was still super girly in her speech patterns as she gossiped about her life back home with all her boyfriends. It irritated Christian. Was this what it was like for men to listen to women? Had her brain already started to go man on her? She blinked several times. She had heard the mental changes could come swiftly and before the physical ones were even that obvious. <br />
<br />
Orientation was next. The drill instructors laid out the law. No one was to disrespect any of the staff. Any sign of femininity would be rebuked. Exercise routines and schedules were handed out. Christian was introduced to several other men to be at the cot filled cabin he was assigned to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess this means I won&#39;t be bunking alone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you thought you were getting your own room? This ain&#39;t a hotel, sweetie. Oh, sorry,&quot; the new buzz cutted girl who introduced herself as Sam told her. &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m trying to keep the girl sounding stuff to a minimum.&quot; The man to be held her hands to her temples. &quot;This is all so frustrating.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. But I&#39;m just going to try to make the best of it. It&#39;s only for a few months,&quot; Christian reasoned. He met his other bunkmates, Marvin (formerly Marisa), Jacques (formerly Jacqueline) as well as Tony (formerly Antonia) and Hank (formerly Hannah). <br />
<br />
The exercises were insanely structured. They ran, they hiked, carrying a ton of equipment. They were exhausted at mealtimes and wolfed down increasingly large amounts of food as well as protein shakes. 2000 calorie shakes! Christian shook his head. Was he really resigned to all this? It seemed so daunting at first but the more he looked at the men who were graduating and moving on, the more he felt a yearning to make his parents proud. He got to talk to them finally after a week at Camp, along with Grandpa. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s not so bad. Hmm. Excuse me. Not so bad. Yeah. My voice is dropping a little. It&#39;s embarrassing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO, honey! Don&#39;t be embarrassed. It&#39;s natural!&quot; her father told her. &quot;If God didn&#39;t want you to turn into a man, he wouldn&#39;t have given you Second Puberty. It&#39;s a gift, sweetheart! Sorry, I mean...son. Uh...tiger? How does tiger sound?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fine, Dad,&quot; Christian said cooly. &quot;Gotta go, they&#39;re rounding us up. Say hi to Katie for me.&quot; Christian hadn&#39;t talked to his little sister at all since finding out about the transition. There were some things he just wasn&#39;t ready for. <br />
<br />
Every night, after supper in the mess hall, the new men were allowed to watch war movies. WW2 mainly, but also Vietnam, Korea and WW1...documentaries, miniseries, movies with some of the grittiest actors from cinema history. There were also Westerns, the more violent and hardbitten the heroes, the better. <br />
<br />
In male behavioral class, Christian learned to practice with his new instructors on proper etiquette. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that how a man stands? With his hands out like this?&quot; one admonished him. &quot;You look like a faggot. Try it again. Come up to me and say hello to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...hello. I was just wondering.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO. Wrong. Why are you playing with your fingers? Stand up straight. Walk like this. Extend your hand and say &quot;What&#39;s up, bro? Nice to meetcha. I&#39;m Christian.&quot; <br />
<br />
Christian practiced over and over again, day after day. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing? Why are you moving your head that way?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m used to having more hair.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you don&#39;t have a lot of hair anymore and you never will. You will not pretend to flip back hair you don&#39;t have. Try it again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hank was having problems being the fat one in the group. They put him on a special diet and already his mustache was growing in. It made him self conscious since he still had large breasts. Christian tried to comfort him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll deflate soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy for you to say, your boobs are almost gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Rude much?&quot; said Sam. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, am I the only one noticing this? Christian is already taller. How tall are you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...ahem...five foot eleven.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How many inches is that?&quot; Marvin asked. Marvin had glasses and used to be a librarian nerd girl, but now he was beginning to resemble a man with stubble, though his voice was still high. <br />
<br />
&quot;Four,&quot; Christian admitted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Four inches!&quot; the group all exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s only been two weeks!&quot; Tony said. Tony had dark hair growing in on his Italian pate, a shimmering of charcoal and eyes to match. Tony looked the most masculine but still hadn&#39;t grown much past 5&#39;6&quot;. Tony was eagerly awaiting his stubble, and out of all of them he was the most excited to turn into a man. Christian was beginning to think he might have an upper edge in the group and that excited him. He hoped he grew to be taller than any of the rest of them...and have bigger muscles, too!<br />
<br />
Christian realized with a start that he was feeling male competitiveness and it wasn&#39;t just there. On the field, he was leading the team in running track, and was doing well at all the outdoor exercises, even the pullups he had been dreading. <br />
<br />
Weight lifting was introduced and Christian took to it gladly. What a relief! It was like all the stress he&#39;d been feeling since this whole thing started went away all at once. Christian found that it had become the favorite part of his day and within a few weeks was excelling beyond almost any other trainee in the ranks of the newbies, otherwise known as the Guppies. Month Two they became the Salmon and Month Three they became Sharks. <br />
<br />
Physical exams were weekly, sometimes several times a week for the Guppies. Christian&#39;s vagina had closed and he had grown a small penis, about one inch long. The holes both worked for piss but it was uncomfortable and took a long time. The staff understood this when bathroom breaks were allowed. Christian&#39;s breasts were now small pecs and her frame was surprisingly strong. He had grown to a full six feet in height and was now the tallest person in his cabin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Harris. I&#39;d like to see you in my office.&quot; Colonel Pitts told Christian after he had earned his Salmon pin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
He followed the Colonel to his office where the man offered Christian some paperwork that showed he was the number two athlete in the Guppy ranks. Number one was that black man from South Caroline. Mack was already six foot three and lifting a hundred pounds for most barbell exercises. It riled Christian up. He wanted to be number one! <br />
<br />
&quot;Your grandfather and father will be VERY pleased, I&#39;m sure.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your counselors tell me that you have also adjusted the best out of everyone psychologically, but tell me that you are hesitant to share your feelings over your changes. Why is that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You do not respond with &quot;I dunno:&quot; to me, Harris! Answer my question!&quot; Colonel Pitts chomped a cigar and lit it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. I guess I feel like while I&#39;m here I might as well stop fighting it. I&#39;ve been picturing it ever since you told me to think about a big stocky muscular man in a dress and...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And it seems like a fucking ridiculous idea, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Christian sighed. &quot;I always thought...gender was fluitd but ever since I&#39;ve been here and I&#39;ve felt the changes I have been reconsidering.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mm hmm. Not so easy when you actually are becoming a man as opposed to just pretending to be one. You know trans people shouldn&#39;t join the military because of just that reason. It&#39;s pretend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So transphobic,&quot; Christian muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? You wanna say something to me? Speak up!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just...I don&#39;t know, it seems cruel.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a goddamned fact! Men want to be women and women want to be men and they look like circus people. Second Puberty is a WHOLE different ballgame, son! You are the real deal. The real fucking deal and the sooner you begin to realize that you are not trans, that you are a MAN who is not pretending to be a man, and that there is a HUGE difference between the two, the better. Now I know you want to fight me on nearly everything. I can tell from your dirty looks, but you&#39;ve been keeping that liberal hippy crap to yourself and I appreciate it. So I tell you what I&#39;m gonna do. You have a weekend day pass into town. You will wear your uniform at all times, and your motel will be arranged in advance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dismissed!&quot; <br />
<br />
Christian drove his new black &quot;pussy magnet&quot; Jeep into town, and his bunkmates had been so jealous when they found out! Good! That&#39;s what I get for working my fucking ass off all month! Christian thought, proud of himself. <br />
<br />
There were women walking down the street and Christian hadn&#39;t seen any women since getting to camp. There were rarely women in the movies they showed, but he could tell that he felt a growning attraction to the opposite...er...to women. Christian had already accepted it without much suffering. He felt indifferent to the change so far but walking up and down the street in his uniform, (the Colonel had given him a list of supplies to procure for the camp so there was a pretext to be in town to begin with) he felt a surge of pride over what he was becoming. True, he wasn&#39;t entirely there yet. His voice was a little bit high. He sounded more like a 13 year old boy than an 18 year old man. But the important thing was he didn&#39;t sound like a woman. And he was walking like a man, too. They had trained Christian every day to stop walking like a girl and he had been remembering his lessons. It was so easy for guys, he thought. Looking at the way they sauntered around, or stood up straight, or walked with confidence. The beta males were the exception, looking at the ground or hunched over. Christian couldn&#39;t help but feel a little bit disgusted by them. <br />
<br />
Colonel Pitt had covered this topic himself in Male Social Roles class. They were training all men at Camp Sawdust Grit to act like Alpha males, not betas, and they explained the differences, showing educational videos of males who exhibited all the signs of either Alpha or beta characteristics. Christian became increasingly disgusted by what was termed beta behavior. He supposed he always had, coming from a military family. The men he had been attracted to as a woman were definitely masculine. As a woman, she had never been attracted to the men presented as being beta male. <br />
<br />
Christian had to follow protocol. Colonel Pitt gave him a list of acceptable male activities, including going into a barbershop. That barbershop knew all the recruits from Camp Sawdust Grit were Second Puberty but they were always under strict guidelines to treat every man that walked through as a natural man and no different from any other man who had always been that gender. Christian found himself enjoying a conversation about war movies he&#39;d seen recently. They probably know in advance what to talk about, he thought afterwards. Still...it felt...good for them to treat me like I was one of them. <br />
<br />
He visited a local bookstore and picked up copies of several Second Puberty transition guides that the Camp ordered to be distributed to the recruits. He walked past a local park and oogled several girls walking past him, amazed by how good they looked in their skimpy summer outfits. <br />
<br />
Mostly, he got plenty of rest and found himself stroking his now hard member to a women&#39;s volleyball game. He didn&#39;t cum but he felt something! It was starting to feel good to touch himself down there with his one inch boy penis. He couldn&#39;t wait for it to grow bigger! He rubbed his face. Felt it again. Wait...was that peach fuzz? Was he finally growing peach fuzz??<br />
<br />
Coming back to Camp Sawdust, he was ready for the grind. He was ready to get bigger and to take on the challenges that awaited him. His bunkmates were all slightly in awe of him as he started to excel at rowing boats, flag football, and archery lessons. <br />
<br />
Over the next few weeks, his Adam&#39;s apple grew in. His voice dropped so that no one would mistake him for a little boy. His mother and father didn&#39;t recognize his voice when he called them, asking &quot;Who is this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me. It&#39;s Christian.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, it doesn&#39;t sound like you at all! How tall are you now, son?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready for this, Dad? I&#39;m six two.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy...you&#39;re one inch away from my height, son!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. What are you gonna do if I grow taller than you, Dad?&quot; Christian smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll buy you a fucking beer and we&#39;ll watch football together, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll fucking do! My son! Six foot two!&quot; Chritian described the others. Tony was coming along and had the thickest stubble and was 5 foot 9 inches now. They had all dropped the boobs except for Hank who now had moobs and Sam was still mad his voice was so high. Everyone had dropped a few octaves. Marvin was starting to muscle up but was still the same height of 5&#39;9&quot; while Jacques was starting to get taller and was now 5&#39;10&quot; and no one had a vagina left. The only exception was Hank who was still experiencing a drizzle. Christian didn&#39;t mention cock sizes but of course Grandpa wanted to know when he got on the phone. Christian could hear his parents telling him to shut up.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna know how big my cock is, old man? It&#39;s four fucking inches. I grew three fuckin&#39; inches in two weeks and I ain&#39;t done yet!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy hell, you&#39;re sounding like a real man every damn day! That camp is worth every fucking penny!&quot; Christian laughed with a shit eating grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I gotta admit that I love it here. It&#39;s hard and I work all the time, but I&#39;m getting into it. And I can bench press 150 now. I can bench press ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FUCKING POUNDS!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT??? Already??? How is that even possible! In a month and a half!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Miracle of Second Puberty, that&#39;s all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Christian hung up the phone. When he got to the mess hall, they announced that the Salmon would be doing war games over the next few weeks. The others groaned slightly while Christian grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can hardly fuckin&#39; wait!&quot; he told the group of men who were quickly learning to look up to him.</p>
