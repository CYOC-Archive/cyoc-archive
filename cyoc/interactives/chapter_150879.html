<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I swear I had only closed my eyes for a brief second when I suddenly felt something considerably wet around my groin. No, not just my groin, but gripping tightly around my cock! What the hell? Am I having some sort of sex dream imagining I’m fucking some random dude again – damn, I’m really gonna need to get laid soon if that’s the case…<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes and found the room was completely dark. Crap, did I have a wet dream then? And since I fell asleep in my work slacks, well, that’s gonna be a pain in the ass to deal with dry cleaning and all that junk. Sigh… But no, I still felt the tightness around my cock, and it honestly felt pretty good, good enough to cause my cock to throb slightly, making whoever was in the room with me whimper slightly. Wait, am I sleep fucking someone? Is that even a thing? Well, it’ll be the most action I’ve gotten in… fuck… almost a year, so might as well enjoy it then…<br />
<br />
So as I’m standing up, I pull out a little and slam all the way back in. The fuck do I care if it hurts whatever dude decided to hook up with me in the middle of the night when I was half asleep? Then I heard the yelp… A distinctly feminine yelp. Great, so I decided to pick up some twink from the bar then I guess. Not my usual type, but any port in a storm as the saying goes. <br />
<br />
“Oh yeah Tony, fuck my pussy with that fucking thick cock!” I heard my partner say. Damn, this dude is really playing up the girly voice, almost enough to make me lose my hard on. Well, I like a nice big cock to play with, and it always seems the most effeminate little twinks have the biggest dicks for whatever reason (damn, life isn’t fair, why can’t I have a big cock – since I actually put mine to use?) So I reach down between his legs and… there’s nothing there! Or there’s something there, but it’s definitely not a cock! Oh fuck, am I actually fucking some chick? I reach around, and yeah, that’s the unmistakable shape of a woman’s vagina, something I had only ever seen in sex ed class, like two decades or more ago, but definitely never experienced in person. I mean I knew I was hard up for sex, but would I really go out and pick up a chick? <br />
<br />
I started to panic… I think this… chick… sensed something was up, maybe she thought I was playing with her, so she reaches around to my ass and pulls me tight into her pussy again, and then starts to grind around on my cock… Fuck that actually feels kinda good! Shit, I know I shouldn’t be enjoying this at all, but honestly, I never fucked a chick before, I guess don’t knock it until you try it? So I just give in, and start fucking her hard core, now she’s getting way into it and screaming “Tony” over and over. I guess I gave her a fake name or something, surprisingly a smart move when I was half-asleep.<br />
<br />
In a matter of minutes I can feel the cum rising up in me, I’m amazed I got turned on enough to actually shoot a load into a chick. OH SHIT! I really hope I wore a condom! I reach down between my legs and feel the unmistakable feel of the rubber hugging my cock, that was somehow more swollen than I ever was before – Damn, I must be really fucking turned on, or maybe I took a Viagra or something? Fuck it, I’ll worry about that later. So I keep pounding, and she’s all short of breath, and then I just fucking ROAR! <br />
<br />
“Ohhhhhhh FUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!” I say in the deepest most guttural voice I think I’ve ever heard out of my mouth, even when I was sick with some throat shit. I collapse on top of her surprisingly well endowed breasts and just keep pumping little short spasms as I continue to shoot my load into the condom. Damn, that’s gotta be the best orgasm I’ve had since I was in college! I just lay there on top of her enjoying the sexual afterglow when I hear her squeak out “Fuck Tony, you’re crushing me you big brute.” She exclaimed with an exasperated chuckle. “Oh, uh, sorry about that.” I say, still with an oddly deep voice as I roll over onto my back beside her. “But fuck that was fun!” She said, reaching down and squeezing my cock, causing me to jump slightly with a deep moan. She leaned over my body and gave me a kiss, explaining she had to go with an early morning. I weakly nodded and said “OK…” feeling myself drift off into sleep while lying there, legs still hanging off the bed, and completely naked near as I could tell. <br />
<br />
I woke up the next morning, room still dark thanks to blackout curtains, with an incessant knock on the bedroom door (what the fuck? I live alone…) In walks a young man, if I had to guess barely old enough to drink legally, wearing a black Nike tank top, gray Nike Basketball shorts, and some black Nike slides with some Under Armor cleats hanging from his shoulders with the laces tied together. He looked to be tall, mixed white and black, and lean but ripped build. “Fuck man, again?” He spits out at me in an unsurprised way, “you gotta quit with this shit man, I don’t wanna have to keep wakin yo ass up for practice and findin you naked with last night’s condom hangin from yo dick, bro!” I looked at him, barely awake, and honestly completely shocked this total stranger is getting on my case at all, especially for… practice? I don’t practice anything other than trying to stay up while looking at boring spreadsheets all night long… <br />
<br />
“Go away…” I say bluntly, and roll over, feeling the load in the condom squish as I do. “Nah… Nah man, Coach made you MY problem, so you’re getting your ass up, getting cleaned, and out that door in 10 minutes even if I have to drag yo huge braindead ass…” I snorted, huge? I’m not lean, but I definitely ain’t fat, fuck this kid. “Fine, do it…” I say and chuckle. “Ugh!” he said in exasperation, “You’re a fucking worthless meathead jock, all you’re good for is taking big dudes down. You can’t even pass a class without someone cheating for you, why they let you in this school anyway?” He said, with a sigh, obviously answering his own question for himself.<br />
<br />
I rolled over and sat up, as the condom slid from my dick falling to the floor, making it splatter and hit my foot, but I was too incensed with this punk kid to care. He started to chuckle at my predicament when I just tore into him “Dude, I don’t know who the fuck you are, but don’t come into my room and tell me what to do, I’m a grown ass man and I won’t be bossed around my some punk kid – how the fuck did you even get into my apartment anyway?”<br />
<br />
He looked at me dumbfounded, partly because he didn’t expect me to blow up on him (or maybe to blow up on him as articulately as I had) and partly because he didn’t understand what the hell I was talking about…<br />
<br />
“The FUCK you talkin about Tony? I’m your roommate, this is our dorm we share and that makes you, for whatever fucking reason, my responsibility since we’re on the team together. Now, if you don’t want to go to practice, fine! But I am not taking the fall for you again. I’m not gonna lose MY scholarship because you want to be a little kid and sleep in. So I tell you what, I’m gonna go get the coach to come talk to you himself, see how you like that shit…” <br />
<br />
OK this kid was pissing me off, but I could tell he wasn’t going to leave me alone unless I did what he wanted, so I caved and said “All right dude, I’m coming. Shit…” I shook my head and stood up. It was then I realized I was actually taller than this kid. Not by much, maybe an inch or two, but his shaved head nearly reached the top of the door frame, so somehow overnight I grew a good several inches. I’m too tired to figure any of this shit out right now…<br />
<br />
So he left and I looked around the room. It was then I realized this wasn’t even my room! I didn’t notice before because it was about the same size and configuration, but those definitely weren’t my discarded gym clothes, my giant cleats, or my free weight set in the corner of the room. The dresser was in the roughly the same location I had mine in my own room, so I started there, finding socks in the top drawer, underwear and tank tops in the next drawer, and gym shorts and casual shorts in the drawer below that. No jeans? No dressy shirts? Maybe in the closet. I’ll worry about that later I guess. Going off of what “my roommate” was wearing, I figured maybe I could get away with something similar. So I pulled out some Nike compression shorts for underwear, with some blue basketball shorts to wear over that, longer socks that looked like the kind you wear for sports (Hell if I knew), and a gray tank top. <br />
<br />
The pieces assembled, I was about to start putting the outfit on when I finally looked at my body, or what I could see from my perspective. The first thing that stuck out (besides my massive new cock and balls) were my feet, they were easily bigger than size 13. I wasn’t exactly sure how big they were yet. Above that were the biggest legs I think I’d ever seen, even bigger than the biggest guys at my old gym. And they were shredded too, each muscle was clearly defined, from the calves all the way to the quads, I could see the detail of each and every muscle. I peeked around my massive back and caught what glimpse I could see of my new ass, and it too stuck out and was solid muscle, I even flexed a few times, making myself chuckle in my new deep voice. Above my re-hardening monster was a solid eight pack that stuck out slightly, but if I sucked it in, it looked like it was carved from solid granite. I reached up with my two massive hands, attached to arms that I swear were almost as big as my new quads, and squeezed my new pecs like they were big meaty pillows. That also made me chuckle, especially when I started flexing them, and making them dance. I flexed my biceps and they grew to a massive size, I was fully hard again by this time, so I started licking the flexed bicep with my new agile tongue while stroking my cock with the other free hand. Damn, I wanted to just fall back on the bed and play with my new toy the rest of the day, but maybe I should get to practice… UGH!<br />
<br />
So I stopped with my cock, letting it deflate a little (though even soft it’s still pretty damn massive). I put on the clothes, sad to see this Adonis body covered with fabric, and grabbed the cleats (peeking inside, they were freaking sized 16!). I was about to just put the cleats on, when I thought better of it, there must be some reason my roommate isn’t wearing his, right? So I looked around until I found some cheap flip flops, probably shower shoes, and slid those on my massive feet. Shit, what about pads and a jock strap or a cup? I started looking around the room frantically, the corners, the closet, the bathroom (finally seeing my face for the first time – I looked like an even hotter version of Chris Pratt, imagine that but with an even more square jaw and shorter hair with bright blue eyes, that was me now).<br />
<br />
I heard a pounding at the door again “WHAT!” I shouted, a little louder than I intended, in popped my roommate again, “What the fuck you doin now man? We gotta go, like five minutes ago…” “Fuck dude, I’m trying to find my gear, leave me the fuck alone!” He started cracking up, “The fuck wrong with you man, your shit’s in your locker, come on man, fucking dumbass…” he said, shaking his head. “I had no idea fucking a chick could make you even DUMBER, but here we are…” He said as he walked out the dorm room. <br />
<br />
I followed after him, running back to grab the cleats, and then followed along him while fuming… I’m not dumb! Am I? Shit, I know the stereotype about meatheads, and maybe this kid didn’t have any lights in the attic more than needed to play whatever sport we play (looking how I do I figure it’s gotta be either football or rugby), but that doesn’t mean I’m going to be dumb too now, does it? Then I realized, I have his body now, which means I have his brain too, and that means I am using his brain to do shit. FUCK! <br />
<br />
I tried to think about something from my graduate level classes, something simple like the formula to calculate future value with compounding. I closed my eyes to think through it, but I couldn’t see it anymore. “Come on Tony, think man!” I thought to myself… Tony? Oh shit, I’m already starting to think of myself as this massive jock, I can’t even remember my old name anymore! Focus, what was I trying to think of? Something about the future, that’s like sci fi shit right? I’m not into that Star Trek kinda stuff, too boring and too many big words. Eh, fuck it, ain’t important, I’m gonna go run over some dudes and show them who the real man is, fuckin second string ain’t got shit on me! <br />
<br />
I smirked to myself and started chuckling to myself. Kenny looked over and shook his head at me, giving me a smirk of his own. “What?” I said. “Nothing man, nothing – You’re just… You’re a trip man, glad you’re on our side…” I looked at him some more, was that a putdown? Nah, Kenny wouldn’t be mean to me, we’re buddies. So I just kept smiling and looking forward to putting on my pads and helmet and doing the only thing I love more than bouncing loose skanks with big tits on my massive schlong! Play some fucking American Football for the greatest school in America – Fucking University of Alabama, Roll Tide motherfuckers!</p>
