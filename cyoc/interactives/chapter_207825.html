<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Again, big thanks to rawr7. He wrote the start of the chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Take him to the dwarves!”<br />
<br />
“Sir?” Sam asked. “Not, like, the orcs or minotaurs?”<br />
<br />
“Think about it, they’ve got gunpowder and…we can always convert them.” Mugrel grinned. “Plus the resources they mine are great for manipulating the auction house prices.”<br />
<br />
Sam smirked and hauled on the fat farmer’s flabby arm.<br />
<br />
Martin jerked in the werewolf’s firm grasped. He was terrified and dazed, though why he was feelin’ so terrified was a bit beyond him at the moment, his thoughts slow n’ sluggish-like. S’what happened when ya got older, thinkin’ got hard. Fer some reason, he kept on thinkin’ he was supposed to be a husky teen, which was silly, since he was nearin’ fifty seasons old!<br />
<br />
They were takin’ him ta the dwarves of some-such, which was weird. Dwarves weren’t monsters, were they? His bracelet cracked a bit more and Martin felt even woozier. What was he doin’ in a gym? Why wasn’t he on his farm with his husband? The hot young stud next to him pinched his ass and Martin moaned contentedly. He loved it when the youngin’s were sweet on him.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I watched in complete horror. Dragging myself away from the glass and to one of the nearby classrooms. Martin had gone from a young redneck to an old and fat farmer. It all had to be from that bracelet. It only happened after they forced it onto him, in fact everything was getting weird after &#39;Reborn Venture&#39; launched. That had to be the source of everything, but a sudden numbness reached me when I got to that conclusion. I thought of Martin and the werewolves. They were always like that. Martin was just a fat farmer that got lost near our school, and the coach was helping him out. Mmm, they&#39;re both kinda hot too. Coaches burly body, and Martin&#39;s pudgy self. Wouldn&#39;t mind some intimate time with either, maybe coach is even recruiting for the team.<br />
<br />
I was getting hard just thinking about it. The captains a loving guy, he&#39;d be happy to introduce me to the team. Break me in, bulk me up, make me so happy to serve every inch of him. I&#39;d make a good jock, not needing to think anymore. Just following the coach and my bros. Plus Sam would be there with me, snuggling up to me and fucking me. Yeah that&#39;d be really nice. My hand starts to stroke my cock, excited at the idea of improving myself even more. A monotone voice coming from my bracelet, sounding robotic as it lulled me to a better fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it. Give in. Let it take over. Let us take over. Go to your coach. Join his pack. It&#39;s normal. Natural. It&#39;s what you want.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I want...&quot;<br />
<br />
I smile, taken in by the programming. Ready to just give in and give up. A shadow being cast from outside, the jocks and their coach lifting Martin and taking him to somewhere else in the school. A loud hell heard from outside, following by a slam, then the familiar voice of Mugrel and Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the other teachers slacking? Why are so many students still human! They should be used to this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Boss, it&#39;s okay. We can make this guy into another packmate.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine, he has potential. Take him to storage, break him in, pup.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing coach!&quot;<br />
<br />
More people were going to fall to these monsters, something about that shook me. I slipped my hand out of my pants, fighting the mind-numbing sensation to slam my arm against the desk. Bracelet cracking further, the reprogramming stopping as the device temporarily sparked. Robotic voice slowing and distorting until it was unrecognisable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Device tampered, location recorded. S e n d i n g a g e n t s t o y o u r l o c a t i o nnnnnnnn&quot;<br />
<br />
It died out entirely, as I started planning. Sam was at the storage room with an unwilling student, making him into a new werewolf. I could try going there to save Sam. But there&#39;s no point, I remember Martin&#39;s words. Kill the alpha and I&#39;ll save all the jocks right then and there. But how the hell am I going to kill Mugrel? He&#39;s a lot bigger and tougher than I am, and there&#39;s plenty of people under his control. I need weapons, and maybe I can get them from the dwarves. It&#39;d make sense, they&#39;re known for crafting. Plus it&#39;s a chance to save Martin.<br />
<br />
I left the room, my hard on completely gone as I followed the trail of these werewolves. They were going further into the school, past hallways that had students standing and talking. My gut was telling me not to trust whoever I passed. Some were hairier than normal, others bigger. At one point I swore there was a mirage. Two men kissing, one was a large green skinned man with two tusks jutting out. While the other was a thinner man with smooth skin and pointed ears. But the moment I blinked; it went to just two ordinary students making out in the corner.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I caught up to the coach and jocks. They were heading into the janitor’s closet, it should be a fairly tight squeeze but they lined in and closed the door behind them. I approached and listened, but heard nothing. It&#39;s dead silent inside, so I decided to check on what was going on. Looking in, and seeing an empty room. The only thing around was cleaning supplies, mops and buckets, and a desk at the back. There had to be something around here, I wandered further in, then felt a sudden pain in my foot. It was dragging close to the ground, and hit against something hard. I bit my lip to shut myself up, and looked down to the wood floor to see a piece raised above the others.<br />
<br />
Slowly, I lifted the wood and set it aside. There&#39;s a ladder going down to a stone cave, how long has this been here? I grabbed onto the rails and descended, putting the wood back in place as I reached a fairly tight tunnel system. There are a few lights dangling from the ceiling, providing minimal vision, but enough for me to get through. I pass by barrels and crates that are filled with armour, weapons, and raw materials. I was tempted to go through them and find a sword to deal with Mugrel, but his voice quickly quashed that idea. Drawing me further through the tunnels to a more opened area where the jocks had laid Martin over an Anvil. <br />
<br />
The werewolves behind their alpha, and their alpha standing with arms crossed. A short and stout man mimicking the gesture, his face weathered. Old and grumpy in appearance, mouth hidden behind countless white hairs. Braided into several strands with gold and silver bands. His head bald, though there&#39;s quite a bit of long hair hanging from the back. Which is treated to the same ties and care as his luscious beard. The two were deep in conversation, and I definitely didn&#39;t want to get caught. Hiding in an empty barrel and listening in on what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;I give you the human, it&#39;s a peace offering.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aye, a peace offering? A piece of shit offering, yer up to something!&quot;<br />
&quot;Up to what? We haven&#39;t taken over the school yet. I try anything and the remaining students might catch on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like that&#39;d stop ye. What is it, spit it out. Ye&#39;ve been more direct before!&quot;<br />
&quot;I <I>am</I> being direct! Us monsters need to be strong before the human&#39;s fight back. Your forces are at the weakest, and you can use another man in the mines. Just take him, Vagruf.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf grumbles to himself, sizing up Martin who doesn&#39;t react to what&#39;s going on. Just spread on the anvil, a few of the jocks groping his naked body while talking dirty to each other. Something that brings a smile to the farmers face as he lets out an innocent laugh. Vagruf silent for a few more seconds, before turning to Mugrel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Thank ye for the gift. I&#39;ll keep the pack in mind for whatever we mine. Now git out of here! I have work ta do!&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon pups, Sam will be done by now. We have another wolf waiting for us!&quot;<br />
<br />
The alpha&#39;s speech perks all of the wolves up. One going to howl, then yelping as the dwarven foreman punches into his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;OUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
The monsters clearing, leaving through the ladder as I remain hidden. Waiting for my opening to search and save Martin. But instead of an opening, I hear chains.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The werewolves had all left, and now Martin laid on an anvil. He missed their company, the nice wolves had soft fur and were all so attractive. Maybe his husband became a werewolf after he went missing, he&#39;d be happy if that was what happened. A calloused and rough hand grabs onto Martin&#39;s arm. The farmer finally looking over to see the dwarf attaching a shackle to his left hand. The cold steel snapping into place, Vagruf moving over and doing the same to his other side. Forcing Martin to make a Y shape with his hands, as the chains move back and lift the human just above the anvil. Giving him a better view of the room, the forge roaring with flame. Heated metal nearby, partially shaped swords laying around. It was kinda like the blacksmith&#39;s building, he remembered going there to get his tools repaired. What was he doing here though? Oh, he was chained up, so the kind blacksmith might be needing to fix him up.<br />
<br />
His simple mind accepted this as quickly as the initial thought came. Two more bindings being attached to his legs, now making a distinct X shape with his body, lowered to be closer to the anvil as the foreman calls out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyrih, Burxten. Git yer lazy asses in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin sees two more dwarves enter. The first looks younger, a mane of flowing blond hairs on his well-built body. Arms swelling with muscle, though there&#39;s a bit of a gut underneath his singlet. It reminds him of his younger days on the farm, before the beer and meat got to him and made him into a slob. The other is older, having a more heavyset form. Moobs barely contained by his sweat stained shirt, grey hairs peeking out of all openings that this dwarf has. He&#39;s good looking too, Martin&#39;s cock getting hard again at all the nice eye candy he&#39;s being treated to. Vagruf undoing the farmers overalls, checking out his new goods while ordering his subordinates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man the chains, ye&#39;ve got a new drinking buddy on the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two dwarves nod, getting in position to raise or lower Martin as necessary. Vagruf tearing off the farmers clothes, gripping onto the lumps of fat underneath, and bringing a finger to the mans drying cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, give me yer sloppy seconds...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, then stripping himself down. His own heavy body greeting the farmer. Every inch of his skin covered in pure white hairs. Form the perfect mix between muscle and fat. Fat enough to grip, but firm enough to not mindlessly jiggle from the touch. Large and rough hands gripping onto the human’s shoulder, barely able to hold on due to the difference in height. Tyrih and Burxten reacting as they lower Martin.<br />
<br />
Martin enjoys every second of what&#39;s happening. Still not understanding it, but not needing to. His eyes getting a good look at this sexy dwarf. The beard, the bod, the cock. <I>Oh the cock. Thinkin’ that’s the meatiest dick I’ve seen. </I> Martin&#39;s mouth instinctually opens. Vagruf&#39;s pubes thick and numerous, but still unable to hide the dwarf&#39;s pride. As long as a well-endowed humans&#39; cock, but as thick as the farmer&#39;s own arm. Rock hard and sturdy, just begging to be pleasured.<br />
<br />
Vagruf continues to grumble his annoyances as he shoves his cock inside the human’s mouth. Martin as ready as he can be, licking his lips, before his mouth is quickly filled. Several of the dwarf’s pubes rubbing against his nostrils. The fat of the forgemaster’s stomach rubbing against the farmer&#39;s bald head. Martin feeling like he&#39;s in heaven, happy to pleasure such a hardworking man. Tongue massaging the surprisingly tough dick. The dwarf not bothering to back all the way out. Just moving his hips slightly, then going forward. Gut hitting the top of the human’s head. More pubes digging into his nose. Cock hitting the back of Martin&#39;s throat as he keeps on his current task.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s used to the rough treatment. Remembering the times his husband would turn the tables on him. When they were young, he would grip him by the hair to guide him in their fucking. But as they got older, it would all be on Martin to do what he loved, and finally he got the chance to do it again. Enjoying the taste of this dwarfs pre, it&#39;s as strong as freshly made ale, and just as tasty too. Martin&#39;s stomach grumbling as he hears the chains adjust.<br />
<br />
The farmer is starting to be pulled up. At the same speed as his body compresses together. His form compacting, broad shoulders and extensive width unchanged while he shrinks by the second. The fat being put to work, parts of it converting to muscle, and parts remaining pure flab. Becoming closer to the dwarves build, having the strength needed to work, and the body that comes from days and nights of drinks. Martin feeling youthful, reminded of his younger days as he pleasured the dwarf with newfound vigour. Moving his head further forward, smothering himself on the dwarfs skin, and getting a grunt of pleasure out of the otherwise stoic man. <I>The sound you’re wantin to be hearing when pleasurin a bloke</I><br />
<br />
&quot;Yer good, lad. Maybe Mugrel ain&#39;t all too bad.&quot; He thinks for a moment, looking down and asking. &quot;Does my cock taste good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin moans in response, chains adjusting further. Creaking along with his changes. Arms being flexed as firm muscle is shown underneath them, muscle needed to man his hammer and ready his metals. Relaxed soon after to return to a more undefined and fatter form. Vagruf gripping onto the muscle and nodding. Martin further excited by his forgemasters approval, his legs shortening, and gaining a similar coating. <I> They’ve got that wee bit of strength I’d need. </I><br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. Yer making a good dwarf.&quot;<br />
<br />
The former farmer blushes. More hair growing out across his entire form. Skin becoming rougher, hands larger and calloused, nose bigger. Still mostly grey due to his age, though he&#39;s young by dwarven standards. A recent convert to the clan. Martin knowing that this is his initiation to a new life. His husband was gone, but the boss here was helping him make new friends and family. He liked it, happy to fit in once more and feel so damn good while it was happening. The creaking of the chains finally stopping, as Martin&#39;s moobs became firmer. Still jiggling as the movement slowed, but no longer wild and free.<br />
<br />
Tyrih and Burxten moved from the chains to the two dwarves. Bringing over a box of jewellery as Vagruf keeps pumping himself into his clansman. More of his pre filling up his kin, and the two other dwarves bringing a hand to Martin&#39;s beard. Their movements calculated, and creating immediate pleasure for their new family member. Just the touch of their rough hands working through Martin’s beard is enough to cause his cock to dribble. Tyrih and Burxten carefully turning and braiding the strands together. Constantly adding jewellery to his glorious mane, and with it adding the feeling that his cock is being stroked. Martin unable to hold it back anymore as his beard is cared for and completed, and his cock empties itself on the anvil. His clansmates not caring that he had just came, continuing to add the finishing touches, and their forgemaster pumping one last time.<br />
<br />
Martin gladly drank what came from his foreman&#39;s cock. It tasted just like their dwarven ale. <I>Course it did. Just a wee bit of cum was in their drinks after all! </I> Not even a drip spilling out as Vagruf pulled away and turned to the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now git to work!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two dwarves do as they’re told, Vagruf inspecting his new acquisition. Even after all the changes, Martin still felt like something was wrong. The damaged bracelet unable to have him fully accept reality. But what was dominant was what wanted to accept this reality. Happy to feel his foreman&#39;s rough gropes on each part of his hairy body. A regular inspection to make sure his body was up to working standards. An approving grunt being the confirming, as Vagruf cleaned up and started to head off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Setting up yer room. Stay there ye wee lad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not bothering to free Martin, as the newly made dwarf was left hanging by chains. Lingering doubts bothering him each second. Memories of being home on the farm. Cuddling his husband. No… cuddling his father. His cousins and brothers… no, their adopted son. Of the werewolves attack, or… of what happened in the gym? It was all so confusing, but then he remembered where he currently was. <I>Forgemaster approves. Cannae be that bad. </I><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I had just watched my friend change, again. The halls were empty, it was just me and Martin. The former farm boy now a well-built dwarf, a clear smile visible underneath his bushy beard. Is he still hanging on? Or has he given in? I want to check in on him, make sure he&#39;s alright. But if he&#39;s gone, he&#39;ll sell me out. I can&#39;t afford to waste this time, I need to find a weapon, and at least save Sam.</p>
