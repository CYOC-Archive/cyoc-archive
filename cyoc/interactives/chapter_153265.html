With a twist of a door handle the four new Succubus stepped out of the transformation chamber which was whitewashed walls with long benches on two walls and two doors. They walked out expecting to see a forest or something of the like, instead the four of them found themselves in a city. It had tall high gothic towers which shot up to points. It had busy streets with multiple different monsters walking up and down the streets like it was normal. As they stood there a group of two Vampires walked by blood dripping from their fangs as they drank from a blood slushy.<br />
“Ah…you must be our 8 o’clock group.” said a werewolf wearing what looked to be a biker vest and nothing else. The vest with the resort’s name and his own name and it was clearly a male werewolf.<br />
“Four Succubus…welcome to the horror section of our mythical section. This is where all Succubus and Horror monsters start but you are welcomed to go to other sections.” stated the werewolf as he held out a computer pad. “Please place your hand on the pad to confirm that you have been transformed and it is as you wish.”<br />
They all placed their hands on the pad one by one as it took a small DNA sample and filed it with their human DNA. <br />
“Alright, you are in the Yeomen’s Manor for a 10 day stay.” Explained the Werewolf “If you choose to stay longer and become a full resident you will have to report to the main office for new housing and for possible job placement if you can’t find a job. Do you understand?”<br />
“We understand.” explained Amber as everyone nodded their heads in agreement.<br />
“Good, your DNA is also on file and is linked to your bank account by placing your hand on the scanners you can access your money and get whatever you want.” Explained the werewolf<br />
“Good, our IDs will not really work right now.” Confirmed Jade with a laugh. <br />
“Now since this is your first stay with us, I must inform you that the transformation can take a lot out of you, it is highly recommended that you sleep and let your body get used to the change before you carry out any stressful activity. Most of all do not attempt to fly until tomorrow, your muscles there haven’t fully formed.” Explained the werewolf “So please head to your rooms and spend the night resting and begin your vacation tomorrow morning.”<br />
After a quick guild the four friends entered the town, it was like a dark twisted open air mall area, there where restaurants selling blood burgers in which you could taste the still warm blood and bars where one could drink blood slushie. A lot of people seamed to be Vampires which explained all the blood but there where gargoyles as well flying overhead and other dark monsters ranging from dark pixies to giants. They passed by a group of dark elves and dark fairs sitting outside blowing smoke rings from a hookah. A large female Minotaur was a large bouncer for a sex club and an open air pit fight between an Ogre and a werewolf while people took bets.<br />
“I think we should get some cloths before we head to our resort.” advised Jade “We only have one outfit.” <br />
They nodded their heads, lucky they didn’t have to go far to find a clothing store. The price was higher then normal for the cloths but they had saved up for a long time to carry out this plan to get out from under their parents and they planned to be wearing these cloths for a while. They bought cloths that would have caused their parents to scream bloody murder and call down the power of heaven on them for even looking at the cloths they now where wearing. Like a lot of resorts when they bought their close, their DNA was linked to their hotel rooms so they didn’t have to carry the items around, they where sent back to the hotel room to await them. <br />
“Well this isn’t Choir music!” yelled Katie over the heavy death music in the bar they where now in, the music was pounding as the four of them stood around a small table. As a shirtless male demon danced in front of them before kissing another male.<br />
“Ya!” yelled Jade as she enjoyed the sight before them.<br />
“Think our family think we are at some religious retreat to prepare us to be dutiful faithful wives.” Laughed Katie<br />
“And to follow our Husbands like slaves.” Countered Molly with a laugh. “So backwards, it is the 20th century not the 16th.”<br />
“Agreed.” Confirmed Amber<br />
“Your food ladies!” said the server as he brought their food and drinks, he winked at Amber smiling as he showed his Vampire fangs. <br />
“Thank you.” Said Amber with a smile of her own. <br />
“Here to our new lives!” yelled Katie as she held up her own drink, it was a mix of blueberries, vodka mixed with small amounts of blood. The Gargoyle bartender recommended it and it was good. It was actually one of the her first drinks Achochla was the gateway to a life of sin according to her father, even while he drank his whiskey. As he would say when she brought that up, men where strong enough to handle the temptation while women where weak. “Here to you Dad go screw yourself.”<br />
“Screw you!” yelled all the girls as they kept celebrating. <br />
Finally they headed to their hotel, the Yeomen’s Manor. It was a multiple story building with multiple stone arches in front of the entrees with flaming torches in front of the main entrees. When they entered and checked in the found that all their rooms where side by side. <br />
When Amber opened her room door she found that instead of a normal hotel room with a bed, a TV and a bathroom it was a large round bed in the center of the room, covered with pillows and blankets. There where no TV and separated by a low wall with a large open window was a hot tub capable of holding two or three people with ease. A shower and toilet were in a separate room. The new cloths she had bought where already in bags by the dresser located along the back wall.<br />
Amber walked over and pulled open the nightstand, normally there would be a bible in the nightstand instead there was a pair of handcuffs, blindfolds and a very large vibrator. <br />
“Clearly not a bible camp.” Laughed Amber as suddenly….</p>
