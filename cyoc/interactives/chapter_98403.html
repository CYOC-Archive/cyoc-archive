<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff realized he should probably go do something but what. He finally decided to watch tv. Jeff walked into the living room which was alone. Soon Jeff turned on the television and began to watch cartoons. Jeff kept on watching it and soon the next thing he heard was a alarm. Jeff opened his eyes to see an alarm ringing. He pulled his had to stop it but it was too far. Suddenly got up in a hurry and looked at his hands. They were small and short. He must had fallen asleep Jeff thought realizing further in to despair since he was now 9 years old. Jeff went into the bathroom and saw that the mirror was a getting a little taller everyday. He brushed his teeth and prepared to go to school. On the bus ride to school Jeff realized this was going to be the first day he was back in elementary school since he was in high school. When Jeff got there he went to homeroom.<br />
<br />
The whole day he learned simple stuff that was easier. It bothered him that he was the only one mature enough to realize how chidish everybody around him acted. Eventually Jeff went home and ate dinner with his Mother, Father, and Brother. His brother talked about the college he was going to choose after he graduated from high school. Jeff already knew which one he would choose but he didn&#39;t want to mess up time. Jeff then did his homework, took a bath, and got ready to go to sleep. Just 4 more days Jeff told himself before falling into slumber.<br />
<br />
Jeff woke up and got ready for another dreaded day but as a eight year old. He felt so small and imature since he was now half the age he used to be. Jeff felt like he was being treated as a child wherever he went since evry adult acted like he was one which he was but not mentally. When Jeff got to School he had gym class. The gym class was much easier but for a strange reason Jeff found it tiring. He realized he only had the strenght the body he was in had. This meant he was losing mostly everything. After a bit more of tourture he went home. Jeff did his much easier homework. Then Jeff noticed something his room had changed. Jeff had been more dreadful he hadn&#39;t realized the changes to his room. It had racecar sheets on his race car bed. His room was full of toys. Then Jeff went around the house and noticed the little changes. The technology was getting a bit more less developed. Jeff then wondered about something when his brother came into the living room. &quot;Hey little bro&quot; he said giving Jeff a noogie. He was only 17, just a year older then Jeff would be normally. When dinner time came Jeff realized his parents looked much younger. &quot;I heard they just developed this thing called a mp3 player&quot; Jeff heard his dad say. Jeff realized that the whole world was changing.<br />
<br />
Jeff eventually got hope when he realized he only had 3 days he could survive if he had already survive 8 days. Jeff felt stranger when he woke up this morning. He opened his eyes and saw a wet spot on the bed. Jeff realized he must had wetted the bed. Jeff couldn&#39;t believe he was geeting more childish. He turned the cover so his mom wouldn&#39;t be able to figure it out and went to get ready. Jeff realized he could only see his eyes and hair in the mirror now. After brushing his teeth Jeff saw his clothes were laid out. It seemed that his Mom set up the clothes you wore. Jeff foregotten she did that. He also forgot how embarresing his clothes were. They had spiderman on his shirt. Also his shoes had velcro and were Power Ranger designs on them. After getting to school Jeff realized that what would happen if he forgot to act mature. Suddenly Jeff opened his eyes and saw himself on the bus ride home. That was strange Jeff thought it seemed that letting go of his maturity caused his childish behavior to take over. Fortunely he was able to control himself again. Jeff just got into bed and realized that his child energy had been wasted and fell imedianlty asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Brother wake up were going on vacation&quot;. Jeff opened his eyes to see his now 15 year old brother in front of him. Jeff remembered that when he was in first grade they took a vacation to Florida. Even though he had foregotten about it since he couldn&#39;t remeber much of it he thought he had a second chance. He got ready and got into the booster seat his mom had laid out. Jeff was happy that he  wouldn&#39;t have to go to first grade. While on the ride Jeff notice his brother was listening to a cd-rom... Wait were those evented a while ago. Before Jeff could process more information he fell tired. Oh-no Jeff thought realizing that he was getting bored on the trip and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Jeff woke up and finally remembered today was hs last day but wouldn&#39;t that mean he was... Jeff got out of his bed and ran into the bathroom, except he couldn&#39;t even see the mirror now. He had to get in the stool and stared back at the reflection of a young little boy. Jeff looked at his body it was just so young, no acne,hair or anything. The door the rattled and opened. &quot;Little Bro move out of the way&quot; Jeffs brother said pushing him off the stool before he kicked it away. &quot;What are you still doing in here get out?!?!&quot; Jeffs brother shouted before literally kicking Jeff out. Jeff never realized how mean his brother was when he was younger. Jeff got up and went into his room and turned on his light. He then saw a room that was even more childish than before. He walked to his child dresser. He opened it and saw a buch of underoos in them. Jeff then took down his pjamas to reveal that he was wearing a pair of underoos yet they felt snug. He took off his pjama shirt to reveal a smooth, chubby-ish, prebescent chest. He took off his underoo he was wearing to see a tiny dick. It was so small and frail. Jeff touched and he erupted in piss and for some reason he couldn&#39;t control it. When he finished there was a wat stain on his carpet. Jeff put on a new pair and put on a shirt,short,socks, and shoes. Jeff then walked downstairs to see his backpack and bagged lunch sitting on the couch. He put it in his superman bookbag and walked to the bus stop.He waited for the bus and when he got on he felt so small. The bus was full of kids much bigger than him now. He saton a seat alone. Finally he was dropped off.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Jeff cried walking back to his house. The kids were so mean to him and everything was terrible. It was a tough life for a little kid. He walked into his house after he controlled himself. Jeff then felt panic wait what year was this. He checked it and found he was in the 90s. Much too early for his family to have a computer. Jeff realized he couldn&#39;t fix and cried out of nowhere. Suddenly Jeff felt himself being whisked away and he was back in his old room. Jeff looked at his hands they were normal. Jeff then noticed he was back in his old room and saw the computer with chrovanic still on it. DING- Hope you enjoyed your choice the computer said. Jeff was so happy he was back to normal but...</p>
