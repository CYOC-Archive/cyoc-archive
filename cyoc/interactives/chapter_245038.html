<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Linda Michaels was exhausted of all of this by now. Magic users, kitsunes, vampires, all she wanted now was what she considered to be her family beside her as they fled from this warehouse together. She went to what was the last location shown of the Seraphim, which was where Lilith and Alyssa were being kept. She burst through the damaged door to see that her &quot;daughter&quot; wasn&#39;t alone in the room with just Lilith and Alyssa, but also Mason Harris, the kitsune Fukushu, and a large dog were also in the room with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eliza! Grab the woman and girl and come with me now, we&#39;re leaving here.&quot; Linda said barking orders to the Seraphim as she stood up, still partially dazed from Fukushu earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Aunt Sophie, you can&#39;t listen to that woman anymore. She&#39;s pure evil.&quot; Alyssa said begging to her aunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, quiet girl,&quot; Sophie or Eliza growled as she kicked her foot against the bars of the cell. &quot;She is.....my mother....and I must....obey her.&quot; Eliza said as she stood up and grabbed her head walking towards Linda.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it Eliza, just come right to me. Listen to your mother.&quot; Linda said with a wicked grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amelia Kane was your real mother!&quot; Lilith shouted towards Sophie as she suddenly stopped in midwalk towards Linda, in the middle of where Fukushu and Mason were still on the ground watching how things would play out. Or at least Mason was, Fukushu seemed in a near catatonic state from what he had almost done looking down at his sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;She....she was a mother of four beautiful children. There was her oldest son, Oscar, who did his best to help out his mother however he could.&quot; Lilith began.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Then there were her twin children, Jeremiah and you, her first daughter, Sophie,&quot; Alyssa continued as the two of them stood up in their cell together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jere....miah? My....my twin....brother? I don&#39;t....I don&#39;t....have a twin, do I?&quot; Eliza questioned as she held her head and began sweating as she tried to wrap her mind around everything that was being told to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then she had her youngest and second daughter, a beautiful little baby girl she called Lillian, but her oldest sister didn&#39;t like it, so she called her....&quot; Alyssa began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, she should.....she should be named....Lilith, because....because.....&quot; Eliza was saying as it seemed the memories were starting to come back to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s a badass name,&quot; Lilith said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And my mom is the most badass woman I know and I love,&quot; Alyssa said holding Lilith&#39;s hand. &quot;Just like how I love you, Aunt Sophie.&quot; Alyssa said as Eliza slowly looked at Lilith and Alyssa with tears in her eyes and almost turned and walked towards the two of them before a shot was fired towards Lilith and Alyssa as Lilith held Alyssa tightly to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; Alyssa cried out as a suddenly memory came into Eliza&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; A young Sophie Kane shouted to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie, listen, your father&#39;s coming home and he&#39;s....he&#39;s very angry, I&#39;m going to need you to go and protect your sister, okay? Protect your little sister.&quot; Amelia Kane said as the memory was now firmly in Eliza or rather Sophie&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
********************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Amelia, Amelia, was my....my real mother.&quot; Sophie said aloud as she heard Linda scoff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Amelia was a weak woman who could never match the woman I would have been to Ezekiel, had I been with him. I would have been the faithful and dutiful wife he deserved.&quot; Linda said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;If.....if she was my real mother, then why did you take me away from her?&quot; Sophie asked Linda looking her straight in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;When Ezekiel was excommunicated by the church for slaughtering an entire tribe of werewolves before torturing a local shaman and fairy fuck, he took it upon himself to try and kill his family. He didn&#39;t think any of you would have survived, and many thought you all had died. But I checked your pulse and you were alive and I took you away from those who would raise you to be a dutiful servant of those heathens. Your baby sister, I wasn&#39;t so lucky in getting. Jacob Moreland had her and would later subject her to foster care families that were all toxic for her. Had I gotten my way, I would have raised her right like Jacob would have wanted.&quot; Linda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But....he tried slaughtering his family, just because of something he alone did? He sounds like a complete monster to me!&quot; Sophie shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only monsters in this world are the ones like the vampire I bribed to torture you!&quot; Linda shouted as Sophie, Lilith, Alyssa, and even Mason all gasped in shock at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...what did you just....say?&quot; Sophie asked almost in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....I had to show you....just....just how cruel the world can be like with these kitsunes and wolves in the world.&quot; Linda said looking at Fukushu and Fenrir as growled Fenrir growled at the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you really been manipulating me, my whole life? Why....why don&#39;t I have more memories of what those two are telling me?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She made me block out those memories Sophie!&quot; Briar suddenly shouted refusing to remain quiet any longer. &quot;She wanted me to block out and erase the memories of your real family, so you would remain loyal to her all these years. Trust me when I say that she&#39;s one of the most evil humans in this world that I have ever met.&quot; Briar said glaring at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Briar, Briar, you were so faithful to me for so many years, now you go and give it all away. Well fine, I guess I can just finish the job Ezekiel started years ago since it seems none of you are willing to go with me.&quot; Linda said positioning the gun and firing at Lilith and Alyssa as Lilith quickly pulled Alyssa down to the ground and lay on top of her to keep her safe.<br />
<br />
Sophie meanwhile dodged out of the way of the bullets before Mason charged at her trying to be a hero in the situation to make her stop. Linda saw Mason charging towards her and kicked him away before pointing her gun at Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;For being such a smart boy, that was your last dumb mistake boy.&quot; Linda said as she cocked her gun and was about to shoot Mason.<br />
<br />
Fukushu suddenly snapped out of his catatonic state and grabbed Linda&#39;s arm and snapped it backwards making even Mason wince at seeing it as Linda fell onto the ground and screamed in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll STILL MAKE YOU SUFFER FOX, JUST LIKE I&#39;LL MAKE YOUR NEPHEW SUFFER AND ALL THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY, THEY WILL ALL SUFFER!!!!&quot; Linda shouted in anger.<br />
<br />
&#39;No, Linda Michaels, only YOU will suffer, for all eternity.&#39; A female voice said as everyone looked around the room in confusion for the source.<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie?&quot; Lilith asked looking around for the demon queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pendragon?&quot; Fukushu said equally as confused.<br />
<br />
Suddenly demonic arms wrapped around Linda Michaels and began pulling her body down through the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What&#39;s happening? Stop it! Help! Eliza! Eliza, help your mother!&quot; Linda called out in desperation.<br />
<br />
Sophie tightened her fists together and glared at Linda.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Sophie Kane, the name my real mother gave me.&quot; Sophie declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you think this is over, it isn&#39;t! You can&#39;t escape Ezekiel Kane&#39;s shadow! You all can&#39;t escape his legacy! The world will forever hate your name!&quot; Linda shouted before finally disappearing below the floor altogether.<br />
<br />
Fukushu felt the area where Linda Michaels had been, only to find nothing to indicate she had ever been there before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle,&quot; Mason asked coming over to Fukushu. &quot;What just happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s over Mason, that&#39;s what happened. It&#39;s finally over.&quot; Fukushu said putting his hand on his nephew&#39;s shoulder.</p>
