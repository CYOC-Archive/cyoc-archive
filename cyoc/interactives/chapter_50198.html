<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the wolves, meals were one of the few times that all of them were all in the same place at the same time. For the most part, the pack would then divide up for the days activities. Martha and Mr. P would likely take the pups outside, the study, the living room. Most of the pack was expected to do some basic cleaning, to make sure that dust didn't accumulate, but would also have plenty of time to themselves. Jensen, with Kaylee and her copies, and the twins would likely change the bandage on Jensen's leg and would then prepare for the next phase of the plans needed to complete pack by adding Julie and her and Fran's children... which would of course require Alice.<br />
<br />
Things were rather quiet as they ate, and the meat was consumed quickly without even a puddle of blood left on the floor, mostly lapped up by Mr. P or the pups. As they finished, Fran and Darla were lead out of the mirrorverse by Alice. Alice was quick to join the other pups and hugging Mr. P while her mother and Aunt approached their master.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will need Alice for what comes next,&quot; Jensen spoke to Darla directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;For checking on the police's progress?&quot; Darla asked back, &quot;Of course, I had thought we'd change your bandages first though. Just to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't want it to get infected, Master,&quot; Kaylee spoke up from beside him.<br />
<br />
Jensen glanced over to see Kaylee and her copies nodding in agreement with Darla. He then glanced down at the bandaged leg. It wasn't bothering him all that much any more, and hadn't really thought much about it since lunchtime yesterday. But he nodded. He couldn't let the wound become infected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Jensen sighed, &quot;We'll change the bandages first. Then we'll send Alice on her mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gathered she-wolves nodded, and began to follow Jensen out toward their small medical center. They did not get far as they found Margot waiting in the doorway to the dinning room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you need something?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a request to make of you, Master,&quot; Margot spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not now, we've only just had breakfast,&quot; Jensen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's not THAT,&quot; Margot answered, &quot;I only wish to ask if I may use my turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On who?&quot; Jensen questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger and Lawrence, Master,&quot; Margot answered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are already part of the Pack,&quot; Jensen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the initial transformation has left much to be desired in physical form,&quot; Margot answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already given both of them orders to do what they can to put on muscle mass,&quot; Kaylee told the red-violet female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Alpha Female,&quot; Margot answered, &quot;but it is not so much the lack of muscle but the lightness of their frame. I mean if they bulked up, their present frame would make the enlarged muscle appear unattractive. Similar to how males stare at breasts. At some point, they get too big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wish to bulk them up?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Master,&quot; Margot answered, &quot;I do not see a problem with it. Neither of them would surpass you and it would allow them to do what they were made to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would also gain you a turn since both Roger and Lawrence have already used their turns and only I would be needed to beef them up,&quot; Margot spoke.<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded again, &quot;Very well, Margot, you may use your turn to beef up Roger and Lawrence. Remember that they are to Nick and Zack's equals. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master, thank you,&quot; Margot bowed and was off like a shot.<br />
<br />
Jensen then continued on his way to have his bandages changed.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, new deer!&quot; Marcy pointed as the she, Jenny, and Alice came into the backyard with Mr. P following.<br />
<br />
Jenny had wanted to check her garden and water that which needed watering. Marcy and Alice decided to tag along, and Mr. P followed to protect the female pups. As they came out, the red-brown female spotted another doe laying next to Marcine and another buck, smaller then Jack, browsing on the branches on one of the trees near them.<br />
<br />
&quot;White tails, I think,&quot; Jenny spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look more like orangish-brown,&quot; Alice commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's their summer coat coming in,&quot; Jenny explained, &quot;the name &quot;white tail&quot; comes from the underside  of their tails. When they run they raise their tail in alarm and every other deer sees that white tail as a warning sign.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will our summer coats look like?&quot; Marcy asked, not knowing a thing about how deer camouflaged themselves in nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely the same as it is now,&quot; Jenny shrugged, &quot;It'll get longer when we get closer to winter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And will be shed the following spring,&quot; Mr. P grumbled as he scratched a spot behind his head, &quot;best leave the deer alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't come to mess with them,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;I want to show you my garden... at least the back part of it as the front part would leave us too exposed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO ONE will harm you,&quot; Mr. P promised, &quot;not while I'm here... although I will need to talk with your father about improving the gate...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Margot found Lawrence and Roger in the male's den looking at the day's newspaper. Zack was surprisingly absent and Nick was gone as well, though Margot knew that Nick was likely doing what Nicole told him to do, trying to find a way help his pack mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; Margot spoke calmly to get the attention of the two males.<br />
<br />
They then looked up to see the red-violet she-wolf standing there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Margot,&quot; both males smiled as best they could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi guys,&quot; Margot gave a slight smile back, &quot;I have what I think should be good news for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good news?&quot; Roger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Margot nodded, &quot;to help with your insecurity around us or around Nick and Zack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You noticed?&quot; Lawrence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's kinda hard to miss when you're not all that confident around us and back away from Nick or Zack,&quot; Margot pointed out, &quot;You thought that last night was nothing but pity sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence looked down embarrassed, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure, but as I said, I have good news,&quot; Margot smiled again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is that?&quot; Roger sighed, feeling nervous about the way things were going.<br />
<br />
&quot;The master has given me permission to use my turn to improve the two of you,&quot; Margot smiled, &quot;You'll be the physical equals of Nick and Zack and should have nothing to fear from them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't fear Nick,&quot; Lawrence said, &quot;He's nice, and always has been. It's Zack that makes us nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He won't, anymore,&quot; Margot replied, &quot;transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot; the two male wolves said eagerly, not wanting to be left on the bottom of the pile when it came to the pack's organization.<br />
<br />
Margot smiled as best a she-wolf could with her muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your transformation, you will both remain as a member of the Big Bad Wolf Pack, but your musculature, frame, and maleness will enlarge until you are as strong and well endowed as Nick and Zack, but will not surpass the Master in anyway. Your loyalty to the Master and the pack will not change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger and Lawrence looked on they began to feel pressure build up inside them, mostly along their shoulders as they began to widen out, taking a definitely more masculine shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's happening!&quot; Lawrence exclaimed as he raised one paw to see his claws lengthen slightly and to feel his biceps and forearm muscles enlarging, &quot;we're getting bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigger everywhere,&quot; Roger agreed as he felt his sheath enlarge, as the organ inside grew larger, even while remaining flaccid.<br />
<br />
Margot felt herself drool a bit as the two males also grew slightly taller as the new &quot;transform&quot; helped them improve from what Zack originally saw as scrawny wastes of a Y chromosome to legitimate competitors for the affections of the pack's females.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Margot,&quot; Lawrence said quickly as he lifted her into a firm hug, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can thank me later,&quot; Margot promised, although admiring his now slightly greater height then before.<br />
<br />
The two males were still smaller then Jensen, but they were now the same size as Nick and Zack were. Margot hoped that it would ease the current power struggle going on between Zack and Nicole.</p>
