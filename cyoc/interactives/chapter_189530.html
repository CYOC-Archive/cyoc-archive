<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The warning tag is more for a combination of male self pleasure and herm self pleasure.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;The only &quot;hive&quot; I&#39;ll be joining is already with me,&quot; Jeff said back to the closed door and then began to step away from it, &quot;and already loves me for who I am, and not because I&#39;m there with a penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then stepped away from the door and moved away, though in the back of his mind he knew what had to be done. If whatever Edward Cupple did had kept him in the Chapman house because he was human, but his mother and sisters could go outside because they&#39;d become Slug Women, the only thing left was really to complete his own transformation. It&#39;d mean losing his legs and potentially having a change in his own gender, but it was also likely the only thing that would really protect his free will. For if his sisters left, while their link through the hive mind might protect them from Cupple&#39;s attempts to overpower their minds, they&#39;d be far enough away that either Megan and Jenny could try to come in again or Cupple would just teleport in and enslave him that way. He had to complete his transformation in order to go with his mother and sisters. If the churches rejected their calls for help as Slug People, they might be able to at least get help and protection from the Slug People colony to the north of where they were now. Lucy and Grace seemed to notice this movement and noted the slight rise in Jeff&#39;s penis as he tried to make his way toward the bathroom. Lucy was the first to  reach her brother and gently put a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about this, Jeff?&quot; Lucy commented, &quot;I mean... granted it&#39;s probably going to happen eventually anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we have much choice,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;if you go for help... I&#39;ll be left alone and who knows what Megan and Jenny may do... or what Cupple may do while you&#39;re gone. As it seems that they already tried something when you went for food, and that was only within the house and while we avoided real problems then... a lot of it was luck. We didn&#39;t know how well the hive mind linking you to Zoe, Grace, and mom would protect you from Cupple... and with no magic of my own... I couldn&#39;t have beaten him at all if he showed up while you and the others were beating Megan and Jenny..&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy nodded, as did Grace, while Zoe and Whitney also moved away from the door to approach.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you all largely stayed you when you transformed... and we managed to talk mom back into mom... at least with regard to her personality,&quot; Jeff commented, &quot;so... I may end up looking different, but I&#39;ll still be me... right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Lucy answered with a small smile and actually slid forward to hug Jeff, &quot;that was one of my biggest fears with all this, even when looking on Grace after she transformed... but when things after wrestling with mom then lead to Zoe and me transforming... I didn&#39;t feel like I lost me. And even with the hive mind... it&#39;s not like I&#39;m now part everyone else... it&#39;s more like I can feel their support and love for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, it&#39;s also helped us tap into your confidence,&quot; Grace said to Lucy as she joined in the hug, &quot;I could feel that when we first met Cupple downstairs and feeling your confidence... it made me feel more secure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe and Whitney also joined in the hug as well. There were a few small kisses on the cheek, something that was more for family love than anything else, and while it covered Jeff in a thin layer of slime from the four of them, it wasn&#39;t much and Jeff also recognized that once he transformed he&#39;d also be producing his own, so worrying about that wouldn&#39;t matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you become a Slug Woman... we&#39;ll do all we can to help you adapt,&quot; Zoe said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jeff said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though it would be better if you did your transformation out here,&quot; Whitney advised, &quot;speaking from experience... regardless of whether you become a Slug Man or a Slug Woman... once you cum... it&#39;s going to be a LOT more than you&#39;ve had before and it&#39;s going to a lot further than you would have had before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Slug People orgasms are powerful,&quot; Zoe agreed as she thought back on her own transformation and actually trigging some feelings of lust that got her penis to slid up and out of the slit where it was contained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And once we can get the help to defeat Cupple and reclaim our home,&quot; Whitney added, &quot;it would be easier to clean the bedroom here than the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hug began to break apart and the more lust driven pheromones were already being produced as Zoe was already reaching full attention in expectation of what Jeff was about to do, and Jeff wasn&#39;t that far behind. Jeff could also notice that Lucy, Grace, and Whitney&#39;s penises were also starting to emerge, pushing the slit open to also reveal their vaginas underneath their penises.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not embarrassed?&quot; Jeff asked, &quot;or ashamed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think any of us have any ability to judge,&quot; Lucy commented as she ran hand down her own erecting shaft, &quot;and we may end up joining you as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked over to see that all of them were responding to the rising lust filled scent that was carrying the room, and Grace even had a finger starting to ease its way into her vagina. And looking down he saw his own penis at full attention and even looking a bit bigger than he normally remembered it being, but he knew what he had to do and reached down to begin to pump his hand up and down on the shaft. The sensation of pleasure was immediate and powerful and it didn&#39;t take him long before he found himself giving an audible moan, though it was soon joined by higher pitched moans coming from his sisters and he found himself moving one eye to find that they were openly masturbating with him, with one hand stroking their penises and the other digging their fingers into their vaginas. It was only when he noted that he was looking at Lucy, who was on his left, with one eye and Grace, Whitney, and Zoe,  with the other eye that he began to recognize something was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some... thing...s ha...pp...en...ing,&quot; Jeff moaned out as he felt his eyes actually push forward with his eyelids moved with them as they took up residence of two stalks that pushed forward from his face. They weren&#39;t super long, but they did push his vision forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yu..rrr st..aarr...ing to ch...an...juh,&quot; Grace answered while feeling her own pleasure rise as she worked both her penis and vagina and noted the two eye stalks that Jeff had just grown were a grayish-yellow color, as where the sensory stalks growing from the corner of his lips. His eyelids, though, where more of a brownish yellow color. From the waist down, his skin was starting to change to a bright yellow color, and Grace also thought she saw some indication that Jeff was starting to produce his own slime, but she wasn&#39;t sure if that wasn&#39;t just something that was left over from the family hug they&#39;d just pulled out of.<br />
<br />
Of course Jeff did know he was starting to complete the transformation as he continued to pump his his penis with one hand, making him moan a bit as he did so. Some of it was now that his fully erect member was starting to get some lubrication of its own and he looked down to see a thin layer of slime starting to coat his hands in a way that couldn&#39;t have come from the hug. The movement of his eye stalks also let him get a better look at the rest of him as his skin from the waist down turned bright yellow. Then as the levels of pleasure grew even higher, it felt like his legs were pulled together an the growth of slime there was even thicker, as if to hold his legs together. He gave a semi-startled gasp and pleasure filled moan as he continued to slide his hand up and down on his penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do...nt wo...ree J...eef,&quot; Zoe moaned out, &quot;y...oar tay...el is stu...ar...ting to fo..rmm. Yu...ll be uh bi...t we...ek as it f...or...mms.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long after that that he watched as his skin seemed to wrap around him from his legs down. As Zoe tried to say, but limited as she worked her hands with her penis and her vagina and thus moaning through her own pleasure driven feelings, Jeff&#39;s tail was starting to form. He felt a little bit weak as the bones in his legs vanished to be replaced by powerful muscles that made up the tail, but the pleasure building inside him was such that he barely noticed it. For a moment he wobbled a little bit and almost tipped forward, but that lasted only for a moment as the new muscles in his tail actually caught and he was able to right himself on muscle power alone, and in this he soon felt feelings of love in the back of his mind that came from Lucy, Grace, Zoe, and Whitney. It wasn&#39;t quite telepathy and judging by their faces they looked to be just as full of &quot;lust&quot; as he did at the moment, but it was something that assured him that he was still loved. That made him happy as he joined the hive mind that linked his mother and siblings, and in looking over himself, he noted that had not grown breasts or anything that would be indicative of being a Slug Woman, which could only mean that he was now an incredibly rare Slug Man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here... I... cum,&quot; Jeff managed as his body finally erupted in full pleasure and a massive shot of semen burst from his now larger penis. It flew through the air in thick ropes, and despite facing the bed, still covered in cum from Zoe and Lucy&#39;s transformation, most of Jeff&#39;s orgasm hit the wall above the headboard and then dripped down onto the bed, and then the second burst hit and was almost as powerful as those white ropes of cum came from his orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are... we...&quot; Lucy said in response as she, Grace, Whitney, and Zoe blew their second load of the day onto the bed. That served to finally get things to calm down a bit. The room still carried a very sexual scent, but with everyone&#39;s orgasms now spent, their penises went limp and retracted back inside the slits that was where their waist had been when they were human. It was then that she looked more to the kind of Slug Man her brother had become. &quot;You&#39;re all... yellow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;I became a California Banana Slug... Ariolimax Californicus Californicus… I&#39;m... I&#39;m not sure HOW I know the animal&#39;s scientific name... but... I seem to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably magic,&quot; Zoe managed, &quot;though you do make a handsome slug.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jeff managed as he slid on his new tail toward the window that he couldn&#39;t exit earlier and tested it again. This time, there was no barrier and his hand passed through the space easily, &quot;though, I&#39;d think for the moment the mission should be to get help... find some way of defeating Cupple. Either from the churches or from the Slug People colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Lucy answered, &quot;and we might get a head start. I think your decision to accelerate your transformation has Megan and Jenny enjoying each other out in the hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
A series of moans heard through the door seemed to confirm that.</p>
