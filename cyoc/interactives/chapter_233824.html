<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark had an idea what to make Aidan, that would be useful to himself. And if it worked like he intended, it would make life a little bit easier for him.<br />
With a grin that Aidan didn´t like, Mark stated: “Let´s see Aidan, I want you to strip naked, as you won´t be needing your clothes anymore afterwards.” Yes, he knew he didn´t like that grin. He was helpless, and turned beet-red in embarrassment when his body did as ordered against his own wishes. Soon, his jeans joined his shirt on the ground. His boxers joined as well, and as he raised his legs to step out of both, he also stripped off his socks, leaving him naked, as he kicked his clothes away from his feet.<br />
Mark laughed at Aidan´s embarrassment, and even more seeing his small gear down there. It took him a bit to calm down enough to continue his plan, but he did so anyway. “Okay Aidan. Now that there is nothing in the way anymore, you will be flattened in your profile, but remain floating in midair, as you will shrink smaller after the flattening until you fit in my hand.”<br />
Aidan looked horrified at that, not knowing what Mark wanted to achieve with that. Still silenced, he couldn´t even scream out the pain he suddenly felt, when pressure build from both sides, starting to press him flat. Aidan was blinded by the pain, and even Mark winced when he heard bones breaking. As quick as he could, Mark used the chronivac to vanish Aidan´s insides, not trusting to voice it. While he could be a little sadistic, he could guess how painful it should have been for Aidan. He only realized that Aidan was still silenced, or he would have been hoarse from screaming already by his guess.<br />
Aidan felt a shift, as his body lost its resistance to the pressure, speeding up the flattening. Without any obstacles in form of insides, he was flat in seconds, feeling increased over all skin of his body at once. The pressure vanished, but his flat body stayed as it was. Suddenly, he felt as if millions of ants walked over his skin, and his sided view made him realize that the second part had started, and he was shrinking fast. Mere twenty seconds after he was flattened, he was now a small, flat, naked version of himself, floating midair in his flat.<br />
Mark collected the floating little Aidan and took him back to the laptop, lying him next to it. “I´m sorry, Aidan, I should have made all this painless for you. I guess if you weren´t still silenced, you would have screamed for the whole city to hear. But it´s done now, can´t undo your pain. And simply let you forget it would be boring. Now, let´s finish your new form, shall we? First, your whole body will become silver-colored, but also as hard as a diamond. I don´t want to break you in half now. Then, your body will reform into its new form. It will be a key, with your head as the key-head, a small hole above your ears for the keyring. The rest will round out, but your features will remain in the metal. Your body will be the key itself, but it will fit in any lock to open, as it will reform to fitting inside the moment it gets stuck in. And you will remember any lock you opened before, easily reforming other keys the second you´re near an old lock. Last, for safety reasons, you will never be more than ten meters away from me, as I don´t want to lose my little key. When all that is finished, you can talk again, but only I can hear you if I want to.” Mark explained, first being a little sad, before becoming excited.<br />
Aidan was shocked. A key? Something of so little importance? Even his added skill didn´t make it better. He felt the hardening, feeling cold for being metal. The hole formed painlessly as his nose receded, rounding out his head, while his body simplified features away. Unbeknownst to him, each mark of his key-body was linked to his old form. The key-tip was his repositioned dick, and the marks of his body from there were his feet, his knees, his hands and his elbows, each right before left, and unused would simply be pushed back inside. But Aidan remained silent, even as he could now speak again, maybe he was just speechless.<br />
Mark waited a bit, but as Aidan remained silent, lying before him on the table, he looked around. He wanted to test his new little key, after all. Aidan had no lockable parts on his desk, and from what Mark could see, there was no locks on any cupboard in either the living area, nor the kitchen. But with Aidan living alone, there was no reason to lock anything normally.<br />
Finally thinking that Aidan´s flat-door was the only door with a lock, maybe beside the bathroom door, he would use it. Aidan´s bedroom had no door, either.<br />
Aidan remained silent, still somewhat in shock, as Mark grabbed him and headed for the door. Only when Mark inserts Aidan into the door lock, he showed a reaction, moaning loudly. To him, it felt as if someone had grabbed his cock and rubbed it all over. The bad part about it being the very tip of his body, it felt the whole lock sliding over it. He even felt his body moving, even if it was a small motion. To him, his feet pushed forward, his knees slightly bend forward as well, while his hands pushed back and his elbows remained where they were.<br />
He only broke out of the bliss as Mark turned the key to lock the door. While he was hard enough to not be breakable, it still needed pressure on one side to turn the mechanism. This felt strongly like he run into a wall with his right side, making him yelp, even as the lock clicked. Mark tried the door, now locked, and nodded satisfied. “My little key works.” He removed it from the door now again searching for another lock.<br />
Aidan was aware of being in Mark´s hands and control, asked in a light voice: “Mark? Can you turn me back” Right now, he was overwhelmed by the feelings. He wasn´t as angry as anyone would think he should be.<br />
Unbeknownst to them both, Mark´s plan for Aidan to “remember” locks he was used for would slowly overwrite his memories, and as ironic as it was, his first lock had overwritten the pain of his changes, taking most of the negative emotion away. From Aidan´s view of the changes, it could have been more of a prank done by Mark right now.<br />
Mark was surprised Aidan didn´t scream at him in spitting fury, but it was good to him anyway. “No, at least not now, my little key.” “As if I would change you back now.” He thought. He knew he was demeaning Aidan by not using his name, even degrading him as a simple object.<br />
Aidan wasn´t happy about that, but before he could complain, Mark slipped him into the bathroom door, making him moan yet again. His “muscles” moved around, repositioning his feet and hands, while his knees and elbows remained in position. Again, he woke up as he turned, pushing the lock closed and then open again, as Mark turned it the other way before pulling him out.<br />
“How does it feel? Mark asked his key.<br />
“Slipping in and out feels great” Aidan replied, “but turning around hurts, as if I throw my body sidewards against a brick wall.”<br />
Mark grinned at him. “Any other locks to test here?”<br />
Aidan pointed out a lockable part in his night table, wanting to feel the slipping again. Mark complied to using him to open that lock next, and as Aidan liked the slipping, did just that a few times. If Aidan still could, he would have cummed now but he couldn´t.<br />
Mark left Aidan in the lock to use the chronivac without him noticing. Wanting to keep his little key, he deleted Aidan´s name from his profile, making him forget having a name. He also erased his human existence from the world, only Mark himself would remember it fully, while his little key would remember being a human once before. Even if he would want to be turned back, without Mark he couldn´t, and he wouldn´t, so his little key was his to keep.<br />
A grinning Mark took his key out of the lock after packing the laptop, and soon left with it and the key, locking the door to the flat once belonging to the little key, also locking away his old life.</p>
