(Ryan&#39;s POV)<br />
The tension in the room hung thick, almost suffocating. Amelia sat stiffly on the bed, her arms wrapped tightly around herself, her gaze fixed somewhere distant—anywhere but the board. Clarissa stretched lazily beside her, tossing out some casual remark that didn’t quite land, while Stacey gnawed at her lip, eyes darting between us all.<br />
I exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of the dice in my hand. My turn. No way out of it.<br />
With a resigned breath, I rolled.<br />
The small plastic cubes bounced across the board, clattering and tumbling until they settled.<br />
An eight.<br />
Before I could even process it, the crystal ball pulsed with an ominous glow, sending a shiver down my spine. The piece representing me slid forward on its own, gliding with an unsettling grace before stopping on a black-marked space.<br />
Random Effect.<br />
&quot;Uh... that can&#39;t be good,&quot; Stacey muttered, tucking her knees closer to her chest, her voice small but laced with unease.<br />
The glow intensified, mist curling from the board in ghostly tendrils that slithered through the air. The dim hotel light flickered against it, making the room feel smaller, more enclosed. And then, the words appeared—etched into the swirling haze like they’d been waiting all along.<br />
A riddle. Cryptic, poetic, and yet somehow... too specific.<br />
&quot;To embrace the softness within, the shell must first be shaped.<br />
The mirror will deceive, the heart will retrace,<br />
What was once steadfast, now laced with grace.&quot;<br />
I stared at it, my chest tightening. The words twisted in my head, each syllable hitting harder than the last. Softness within. Laced with grace. A sick realization curled in my gut, and for a fleeting second, I thought about standing up, calling it quits, walking away.<br />
But my body wouldn’t move.<br />
The glowing letters seemed to pull at me, as if the game had already made its choice—and deep down, I could feel it too. Something inside me... shifting.<br />
And then, it happened.<br />
<br />
The heat started slow, creeping under my skin like a whisper, curling through my veins with an unsettling ease. It wasn’t sharp or sudden—it was insidious, spreading outward in waves, wrapping around me like invisible hands molding clay. I could feel it pulling, tightening, reshaping.<br />
I clenched my fists against the growing pressure, but something was off. My fingers trembled in my lap, and when I looked down, my heart lurched. They were smaller. Slimmer. More delicate than they had any right to be. The knuckles I was used to seeing were softer now, the veins beneath my skin barely visible, leaving behind something... dainty.<br />
A cold sweat broke across my back as the sensation deepened. My chest burned, a prickling, tingling pressure building beneath my skin, and I gasped as something shifted inside me. My ribs seemed to squeeze inward, my waist narrowing unnaturally, cinching tighter and tighter until I felt lightheaded. The curve of my torso melted into something unnervingly smooth, an exaggerated hourglass taking shape where it never should have been.<br />
I forced myself to breathe, each inhale shallow and ragged. This isn’t real. This can’t be real.<br />
But my body told a different story. My hips pulsed with an uncomfortable fullness, stretching outward, pressing against the waistband of my pants until they sat higher, clinging too tightly in all the wrong places. I shifted, and an unfamiliar weight settled in my lower back, the curve of my ass pushing against the fabric in a way that made me wince.<br />
The next wave hit my legs—my thighs thickening, closing the natural gap I was used to, leaving them flush and smooth. I swallowed hard, trying not to panic as my calves took on a more toned, shapely form, my ankles narrowing to a dainty point. I could already feel the difference in how I sat, how my knees instinctively pressed together, my posture no longer my own.<br />
And then, my face.<br />
The pressure behind my cheekbones surged, pushing them outward, sculpting higher, sharper planes that were alien to me. My jawline softened with a sickening pull, the familiar strength dissolving into something delicate, something petite. My lips tingled and plumped, swelling into a poutier shape, and I felt my brow lift ever so slightly, my skin smoothing over into something too perfect.<br />
I couldn’t look. I didn’t need to. I knew that if I did, I wouldn’t see myself anymore.<br />
I shifted again, the movement making me painfully aware of something else—something that hadn’t changed. My stomach twisted at the contrast, the weight between my legs still there, still me, while everything else... wasn’t.<br />
What the hell am I becoming?<br />
My breath hitched as I felt the final piece fall into place—my skin, silky soft, too smooth, too flawless, every rough edge erased. The tiny prickle of body hair I’d never thought about was gone, leaving only a disturbing, unnatural perfection behind. Even the clothes I was wearing didn’t fit right anymore, the fabric stretching in ways it never should have.<br />
I wanted to scream, to rip off the feeling of it all, but my hands wouldn’t stop trembling, tracing over the new curves, the foreign softness that now belonged to me.<br />
I sucked in a shaky breath, staring down at myself, my mind racing, screaming for an explanation, for a way out.<br />
But the board sat still. The crystal ball’s glow dimmed.<br />
And I was left with the horrifying, undeniable truth.<br />
I wasn’t the same anymore.<br />
<br />
(Ryan&#39;s POV)<br />
Clarissa&#39;s voice cut through the suffocating silence like a knife. “Holy... dude.”<br />
I snapped my head up, my pulse hammering in my ears. The way she was staring at me—wide-eyed, mouth slightly open—sent a shiver down my spine. My hands trembled as they gripped the silky fabric draped over me, but I didn&#39;t need to look down to know something was very, very wrong.<br />
The babydoll nightie clung in all the wrong places, brushing against my skin in ways that made my stomach churn. It was soft, delicate, and light as air, but it might as well have been a straightjacket. The hem tickled the tops of my thighs, and with every nervous shift, the lace scratched against my skin, reminding me how little I was actually covered.<br />
No.<br />
I swallowed hard, fingers curling into the fabric as if I could somehow pull it away, as if I could undo whatever had just happened. My chest rose and fell too fast, the new weight—the softness—pressing against my palms in a way that sent a bolt of panic through me. My thighs, now smooth and shapely, pressed together with an unfamiliar tension, and the silky panties hugged my hips, the delicate fabric stretched snugly across me in a way that made it painfully clear—I was still me down there.<br />
A shaky breath escaped me, but it wasn’t the one I expected. It was softer. Higher. Not mine.<br />
The room hung in silence for a beat too long. Then Stacey’s voice broke through, hesitant, laced with disbelief. &quot;Ryan...?&quot; She said my name like she wasn’t sure it belonged to me anymore.<br />
I looked at her, saw the uncertainty flickering across her face, and for a second, I thought she might actually start crying. Her knees were drawn up to her chest, eyes darting between me and the game board like she was waiting for someone to hit the rewind button.<br />
Clarissa, on the other hand, was taking it all in with a slow, appraising grin. She leaned back against the pillows, her arms stretched behind her head, and smirked. “Well... at least the game’s got taste,” she said, eyes trailing down my frame like she was evaluating a new recruit for the team. “Pink suits you, man.”<br />
I felt my face burn, heat creeping up my neck in an uncontrollable flush. “Shut up,” I snapped, but even that came out too soft, too breathy. My stomach lurched.<br />
Clarissa’s grin widened, and she tipped her head to the side. “Relax, princess. You’re pulling it off.” Her eyes lingered way too long on my chest, and I instinctively crossed my arms, trying to hide what was painfully obvious. The movement only made it worse—the soft swell pressed against my forearms, reminding me of how much had changed.<br />
I tried to focus on something—anything—else. My breathing. The pounding in my chest. The game board. The weight in my lap.<br />
I shifted, and there it was. Still there. The silky panties pressed firmly against me, tight and restrictive in a way that made me want to crawl out of my skin. Relief crashed over me like a tidal wave. Whatever the game had done, at least... that was still intact.<br />
Stacey, catching the movement, chewed on her lip. “Ryan... are you... you know, still...?” Her voice trailed off awkwardly, and she gestured vaguely at my lap, her face burning red.<br />
I shot her a glare, frustrated and embarrassed all at once. “Yes, okay? It’s still there.” The words tumbled out in a rush, and I hated how desperate I sounded.<br />
Clarissa snickered. “Good to know,” she said, propping her foot up on the edge of the bed, lounging like she didn’t have a care in the world. “Though, I don’t think those panties were made for... all that.”<br />
I groaned, burying my face in my hands. “Just... stop.”<br />
The weight of their stares felt crushing, like they were seeing me for the first time—or worse, seeing someone entirely new. I wasn’t me anymore, not to them, and the thought made my chest tighten.<br />
The lace of the nightie brushed against my skin again, reminding me of the way it fit—how it accentuated everything it shouldn’t. My waist, impossibly narrow. My hips, rounder, fuller. My legs, longer and softer, completely hairless. And my face... God, I didn’t even want to think about my face.<br />
Stacey let out a nervous laugh, shaking her head. “I can’t believe this is happening.” Her eyes darted to the crystal ball, still glowing ominously. “Ryan, we have to figure this out before it gets worse.”<br />
I wanted to agree. I wanted to say something, anything that would make this better. But all I could think about was how wrong my body felt. How foreign it was.<br />
And how deep down, part of me was terrified that this... might not go away.<br />
Clarissa’s voice broke through my spiral. “Hey,” she said, surprisingly softer this time, “just take a breath. We’ll figure it out.”<br />
I met her gaze, and for a moment, I saw something I hadn’t expected—concern. Real concern. But it was fleeting, disappearing beneath that cocky smirk. “And hey, at least you got curves now,” she added with a wink.<br />
I groaned. “Kill me.”<br />
“Not before the next turn, princess,” Clarissa teased, tossing a pillow at me.<br />
It hit me square in the chest, and the soft weight pressed against me in a way that made my stomach twist. I didn’t laugh.<br />
<br />
(Ryan&#39;s POV)<br />
I shut the bathroom door behind me, pressing my back against it as if it could somehow stop reality from creeping in. My chest rose and fell in shallow, uneven breaths, each inhale feeling foreign against the delicate fabric now brushing against my skin. The thin straps of the babydoll nightie bit lightly into my shoulders, the lace so soft yet so intrusive, clinging with every tiny movement as if to remind me that it didn’t belong to me.<br />
I took a hesitant step toward the mirror, the plush pink slippers muffling my footfalls, their softness unsettling in a way I couldn’t explain. Each step felt like a betrayal of everything I once was, the sensation too light, too delicate to be mine. My fingers trembled as I reached for the sink, gripping it tightly, desperately needing something solid to anchor me.<br />
And then, I looked up.<br />
The face staring back at me was a stranger. The delicate jawline, the high, sculpted cheekbones, the full, glossy lips—they were all wrong. Too perfect. Too artificial. My eyes drifted upward, tracing the immaculately shaped arch of my eyebrows, filled in with cruel precision, framing eyes that were larger, softer, fringed with impossibly long, curled lashes. I blinked, the weight of mascara making the motion feel exaggerated, almost theatrical. A bitter lump formed in my throat.<br />
My chest tightened, and I instinctively pressed my hands to the soft swell beneath the lace. My heart pounded as my fingers met the weight of my surgically enhanced breasts, firm yet yielding, pressing against the sheer fabric with an undeniable presence. The tiny satin bow at the center rested against my sternum like a mocking declaration of my new reality. My fingers brushed against my nipples, sending a shiver racing down my spine—a sensation so alien, so wrong, that it made my stomach turn.<br />
With a shaky breath, I tugged at the lace, shifting it aside to get a better view. The sight made my head spin. There they were, fully formed, round, and perky, a perfect mockery of femininity. The skin was smooth, unblemished, and so foreign under my touch. I traced along the curve with hesitant fingers, the warmth, the softness all too real. My stomach twisted in knots, bile rising in my throat as I realized just how seamlessly they were now a part of me.<br />
<br />
My breathing hitched, ragged and shallow, as I pressed my hands against the sink for support. My body trembled, a fine sheen of sweat coating my skin, making the lace of the nightie cling even tighter. The mirror reflected a nightmare I couldn’t escape—soft curves, delicate features, and the unrelenting swell of my chest. The pressure in my gut twisted, the weight of my transformation settling deep, heavy, and undeniable.<br />
I pressed down lightly, feeling how tight everything was, the delicate material doing nothing to hide the truth beneath. My head swam, the sheer wrongness of it all sending my heart into overdrive. Desperation clawed at my chest as I hooked my fingers under the waistband of the lace panties, tugging them down with shaking hands. The silky fabric resisted at first, clinging to my hips, but with one final pull, I freed myself.<br />
I looked down, my breath catching in my throat. There it was—long, heavy, and undeniably mine. But it felt... different. The familiar weight now carried an eerie softness, a subtle lack of firmness that sent a fresh wave of nausea rolling through me. My stomach clenched as I reached out, fingers trembling as they traced over the length of it, expecting reassurance and finding only more unsettling change.<br />
The absence of my testicles left it looking... feminine in a way that twisted my insides. Without them, the girth and sheer size seemed almost exaggerated, standing out in stark contrast to the delicate lace framing my hips. My fingers trailed lower, ghosting over the smooth, empty space where something once hung heavy. A choked sob bubbled up in my throat, my knees threatening to buckle as the sickening realization dug its claws deeper into me.<br />
My throat tightened, and I gagged, the urge to vomit nearly overwhelming as I staggered against the sink again. The conflicting sensations warred inside me—fear, confusion, and a heat that wouldn’t leave. My reflection blurred with unshed tears, my lips parted in shaky gasps, and I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to will it all away.<br />
But it wouldn’t go away.<br />
I opened my eyes again, and the stranger was still there, flushed cheeks, trembling hands, and a look that was equal parts horror and reluctant fascination. The lace of the nightie tickled my exposed thighs, the weight of my chest pressing down with every breath, and the ache between my legs refusing to be ignored.<br />
I needed to know. Needed to feel it all. Because if I didn’t, if I just ignored it, then maybe—just maybe—it wouldn’t be real.<br />
With a shaky breath, I let my hands roam again, tracing the curves, the edges, the softness that shouldn’t exist. My stomach churned, but I couldn’t stop.<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be happening...&quot; I whispered, but deep down, I knew it already had<br />
<br />
(Amelia&#39;s POV)<br />
The bathroom door clicked shut, and I exhaled, feeling the tension in the room settle into an uneasy quiet. The mattress shifted beneath me as I adjusted my position—carefully, deliberately. Sitting was the only thing keeping it in place, but the constant pressure, the way my muscles clenched instinctively against it, was already wearing me down. Every tiny shift, every little movement sent a pulse of discomfort through me, and I could feel the burn lurking, threatening to come back with full force if I let up for even a second.<br />
Clarissa, of course, had other plans.<br />
“So,” she said, stretching her arms behind her head with that same obnoxious ease she’d had since her change. “You gonna tell us what’s really happened with you in the bathroom, Ames?”<br />
My stomach twisted, and my grip on the blanket tightened. “Clarissa, don’t.” My voice came out tight, too defensive, and I hated how obvious it sounded.<br />
She smirked, leaning forward, elbows resting on her knees in that wide, careless sprawl she’d taken on since the game did... whatever it had done to her. “What? We all saw you squirming, and you’re sitting like you’re afraid to move an inch.” Her gaze flicked to my lap, and I shifted, my thighs pressing together involuntarily. “I mean, if you’re dealing with what I think you are... yikes.”<br />
Stacey shot her a glare, shifting closer to me in that instinctively protective way she always did. “Clarissa, seriously? Back off.”<br />
Clarissa held up her hands in mock surrender, but the grin never faded. “Relax, I’m just saying. We’re in this together, right?” She paused, her gaze flicking toward the bathroom door. “Besides... at least you don’t have to deal with... that.”<br />
I could feel my face heating up, and I refused to follow her gaze, but Stacey did. She bit her lip, glancing at the closed door, then back at us. “I mean... did you see him? I—I know it’s still him but...” she trailed off, her expression torn between pity and disbelief.<br />
Clarissa snorted. “Yeah, I saw him. Or should I say, her? I have no idea what he is” She leaned back, spreading her legs further apart, shaking her head in amusement. “I mean, those things on his chest? Dude’s stacked now.” She grabbed her own chest and a small grope stated &quot;I wish I had puppies that like…&quot;<br />
I felt my stomach twist, a wave of secondhand embarrassment washing over me. “Clarissa, stop.”<br />
“What? It’s true!” She gestured toward the bathroom, her eyes twinkling with mischief. <br />
Stacey groaned, burying her face in her hands. “God, you’re impossible.”<br />
I shifted again, trying to find relief in the smallest of movements, but every little adjustment reminded me that I was stuck. My ass were already aching, my body screaming for release, but I couldn’t—wouldn’t—let that happen, not here, not now. The snug fabric pressing against me, holding the travel item up in me and keeping everything in place, felt like a ticking time bomb, and the way Clarissa kept staring at me wasn’t helping.<br />
“I can’t believe we’re actually talking about this,” I muttered, pressing the heels of my hands into my thighs, trying to focus on anything else.<br />
Clarissa grinned. “You can’t believe it? I can’t believe Ryan’s not out here losing his mind.” She stretched lazily. “Bet he’s in there right now just... Just checking it all out.”<br />
Stacey made a strangled noise of protest. “Oh my god, Clarissa!”<br />
I squeezed my eyes shut, the pressure in my lower half pulsing insistently. “Can we not talk about it?”<br />
Clarissa chuckled, leaning back against the pillows, clearly enjoying herself far too much. “Alright, alright. Just saying, at least I don’t have it the worst.” She looked over at me, eyes flicking downward for just a second before adding, “Yet.”<br />
My fingers curled into the blanket, frustration building alongside everything else inside me. “Clarissa,” I said, voice low and tight.<br />
She held up her hands again, grinning. “Fine, I’ll drop it.” But the way she looked at me made it clear she wasn’t done—not really.<br />
Stacey reached over and gave my knee a reassuring squeeze, whispering, “Just ignore her.”<br />
I nodded, focusing on the warmth of Stacey’s touch instead of the unbearable awareness of everything else.<br />
A muffled sound from the bathroom caught all our attention, and we fell silent, eyes snapping to the door.<br />
Clarissa smirked. “Sounds like he’s having a great time in there.”<br />
Stacey groaned. “Clarissa. Seriously.”<br />
I bit the inside of my cheek and stared at the floor, counting the seconds in my head, waiting for this nightmare to be over.<br />
<br />
(Stacey&#39;s POV)<br />
Ryan stepped out of the bathroom like a man on a mission—except he didn’t look like a man anymore. The soft pink nightie clung to his curves in ways I couldn’t wrap my head around, the lace edges brushing his thighs with every hesitant step. But what caught me most off guard wasn’t the outfit—it was his posture, the way he walked with one hand firmly pressed over the front of his panties, his knuckles white, his jaw clenched tight. He was trying unsuccessfully to hid a large erection poping out the top of his panties. <br />
He wouldn’t meet our eyes, not fully. His gaze darted around the room, desperate, like he was looking for something to hold onto—something that wasn’t the soft sway of his own hips or the ridiculous slippers he now wore.<br />
Clarissa, sprawled across the bed, barely lifted an eyebrow, but I saw it—the flicker of interest behind the lazy grin she always wore now. “Damn, Ry,” she drawled, stretching her arms over her head. “You hot.”<br />
Ryan shot her a sharp glare, shifting uncomfortably. His hand pressed tighter against his front, and I could see the slight tremble in his fingers, the way his shoulders hunched inward, like he could make himself smaller. He crouched by his travel bag, unzipping it with shaky hands, but as soon as he lifted the flap, his entire body stiffened.<br />
I moved closer, peering over his shoulder. And that’s when I saw it.<br />
Pink lace. Silk ribbons. Tiny, frilly skirts. Corsets. Stockings.<br />
His hands hovered over the items, frozen in disbelief. For a second, I thought he might laugh, maybe even throw it all out onto the floor, but he didn’t. Instead, he just stared, his shoulders rising and falling in shallow, uneven breaths.<br />
Clarissa let out a low whistle. “Well, looks like you’re set for the weekend.”<br />
I shot her a look, my stomach churning. “Clarissa, not now.”<br />
She shrugged, but there was something too smug in the way she watched him, like she was enjoying it a little too much. I turned back to Ryan, who had pulled out a silky camisole and was staring at it like it might bite him.<br />
“Oh my God...” he muttered under his breath, and I could hear the crack in his voice. He dropped the camisole like it burned him, then yanked out another item—something lacy, delicate, and so absurdly tiny that I felt my own face heat up just looking at it.<br />
Beside me, Amelia shifted awkwardly, her face still a little pale from earlier. I caught the small, tight movements of her hips as she curled her toes and clenched her feet. I knew why—At least I think I knew what she was going through—but right now, she was looking at Ryan, something soft and understanding in her eyes.<br />
With visible effort, Amelia stood, her movements slow, careful. I watched as she walked across the room, her hand acting as a barrier at the base of her rear as if she needed to hold something in like she was headed to the bathroom in a hurry, pressing up in her rear. She hesitated for a second, then knelt down beside Ryan, biting her lip.<br />
Ryan blinked up at her, his eyes wide with something that looked dangerously close to breaking.<br />
Amelia, her voice quiet but steady, held out a pair of spare volleyball shorts and an oversized t-shirt she had grabbed from her bag. “Here,” she said gently. “It’s... not much, but it should cover you up better.”<br />
Ryan stared at the clothes like they were a lifeline, his hands hovering just above them. His throat bobbed as he swallowed hard, then nodded once, taking them from her with a shaky breath. “Thanks,” he muttered, barely above a whisper.<br />
Clarissa leaned back, grinning wider. “Aw, isn’t that sweet?”<br />
Ryan shot her a murderous look, then dragged his hands down his face, the pink lace of the nightie shifting awkwardly as he did. “This isn’t funny,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else.<br />
Amelia gave him a small, understanding nod, her fingers pressing a little harder into the fabric at the back of her shorts before stepping away. She didn’t say anything else, but the way her shoulders tensed told me everything I needed to know. She got it—what he was feeling. She really got it.<br />
As Ryan stood up, clothes in hand, he hesitated. I could see the internal struggle on his face—the thought of changing again, of looking at himself in the mirror one more time. He shot a glance at Amelia, a flicker of silent gratitude passing between them before he disappeared back into the bathroom.<br />
When the door clicked shut, Amelia let out a shaky breath, rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly. “I just... thought it might help.”<br />
“He still...” Amelia’s voice was quiet, hesitant. “I mean... he’s still... a guy, right?”<br />
Clarissa leaned forward, her smirk widening. “Oh, trust me, Ames. Did you not see that monster. He’s still got plenty package there.” Her eyes flicked <br />
<br />
Stacey hugged her knees to her chest, her voice strained. “What if this game doesn’t stop? Like... what if it makes us do worse things?”<br />
Clarissa arched an eyebrow, that smirk still hanging on her lips. “You mean worse than turning him into Miss Sissy over there?” She gestured toward the bathroom door with a chuckle. “I think we’re way past ‘worse,’ Stace.”<br />
Amelia didn’t respond. Instead, she slowly made her way back to the bed, lowering herself carefully, biting back a small wince as she settled in. I saw the way her hands curled tightly into the blankets, how she kept her legs pressed together like she was trying to hold everything in place.<br />
I swallowed hard, the weight of everything settling in heavier than ever. This game wasn’t just messing with us. It was changing us in ways we weren’t ready for. And I had no idea how much worse it was going to get.</p>
