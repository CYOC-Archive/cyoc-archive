<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle gasped, seeing his own head while, mere inches away from his face, was the ample chest of the woman whose body was now his. He noticed the badge on her chest, a golden name tag with the name of the bank his mom worked at, and under its logo was a name that was all too familiar. Sheila Perkins.<br />
<br />
“No! It can&#39;t be mom! I can&#39;t!” They both shouted in unison, backing away hurriedly, falling backwards onto their asses. Kyle stared at his mother&#39;s body and back at himself at the same time and shuddered.<br />
<br />
Sheila Perkins, age 54, was not actually Kyle&#39;s birth mother, she had married Kyle&#39;s dad after his mother had died, and a few years ago his father died as well, she treated him well, but more like a room mate rather than a son. Her behavior around him after he turned sixteen was lewd to say in the least, dressing in revealing clothing around the house, making sure to show a lot of her ample cleavage around him. “Accidentally” bumping into him with her plump ass against his crotch, faking a fall just to put his face into her breasts by “accident”, she seemed obsessed with the sexy step mom fetish. More than once Kyle had to jerk off after these encounters, trying not to and failing to not fantasize about her while doing it.<br />
<br />
And her she was, staring at him as he watched himself through her eyes. Sheila was taller than Kyle by a foot, enough that his eyes met with her cleavage if they were standing in front of each other. She had the classic cartoon milf body, wide hips, thick thighs, a thing waist and breasts as large as cantaloupes. Her face was soft, and round, with slightly pronounced cheek bones, sharp green eyes and full lips, she wore her wavy hair long, and tied in a pony tail which stopped at her shoulder blades. She had been on her way to work when the curse plucked her out of her bus seat, Kyle remembered that she had been promoted to branch manager, which she was excited to get started, but bemoaned the hours she would have to work. Kyle had breathed a sigh of relief at the news, he could get some breathing room from his sex crazed step mom, but not anymore.<br />
<br />
“Well.” Kyle said from his body.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Sheila&#39;s body said under his command.<br />
<br />
“I guess she finally gets what she wanted.” They said in unison.”So how do we... do you... well...” He trailed off as he realized that he had to do the dare that Jen said, and that he&#39;d be fucking her body every day from now on. “Damn.” They sat there in silence for a few minutes, Kyle wondered why they hadn&#39;t been forced to fuck by the curse, but he figured it had already knew he would just do it. Kyle started moving his bodies to strip. <br />
<br />
“May as well get this over with Kyle/Kayla.” He muttered to himself and stopped. “Kyle.” She pointed at her male body, “Kayla.” She pointed at herself, trying to say his name but forced to say the new one. “Okay.” She said and continued taking off clothes, she started at her shoes as Kyle had already gotten naked and made his way over to his bed, sitting down and watching her through both sets of eyes. She undid her top and paused, bringing her hands to her chest. <br />
<br />
“Damn.” Kayla said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and their mine now.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“I know,” Kayla said messaging her breasts.<br />
<br />
“Stop that.” Kyle shivered.<br />
<br />
“Come on dude, we&#39;re about to fuck, I can to this if I want to.” Kayla giggled. She continued to message them, getting Kyle hard as a rock. She undid her bra, and pulled off the last bits of clothing leaving her naked in all her glory, she stood up and walked over to him, her hips naturally bobbing back and forth, even though he tried to stop them. She stopped standing in front of him, Kyle looked down at himself, and back at herself through both sets of eyes. <br />
<br />
“You&#39;re strangely okay with this.” Kayla said to herself.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s all so weird, this can&#39;t be happening.” Kyle said to himself. “I don&#39;t think I can...” Kyle was cut off by his other half when she suddenly grabbed his head and shoved it into her pussy. “No more talking until you finish breakfast.” Kyle tried to fight the urge but found himself with his mouth full of his step mother&#39;s pussy as Kayla started to talk.<br />
<br />
“Oh Kyle,” She cooed. “Jen didn&#39;t say that I would be gone, we have all of mommy&#39;s memories and personality in here, I&#39;m just mostly under your control, except when I&#39;m horny, and this is so fucking hot.” Kyle continued to eat his new pussy, “I can feel your body too! Give mommy a fun time!” She shouted as he ate her until she climaxed, he fell back moaning through both bodies as she fell on top of him, mounting his cock.<br />
<br />
“No, no, no!” Kyle stuttered, “Stop! Wait!” Kayla kissed him.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you want it?” She cooed in his ear.<br />
<br />
“Yes! But let me breath for a minute!” Kyle gasped.<br />
<br />
“Mommy needs this, I always wanted it so bad, but you never let me have it, and it&#39;s all ours! And I can feel you too! This is amazing! I&#39;m part of you and you&#39;re part of me! Oh Kyle! We need to thank Jen for this!” She shouted as she started to grind on his cock, Kyle couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t stop her, she was right this was bliss, heaven on earth. They felt sensations that no one had ever felt before, twin bodies feeling each other as they reached climax again and again, their stamina unnaturally high, they committed themselves to their private orgy. After half an hour of non stop sex, they finally stopped, Kayla laying on top of him, Kyle feeling her flesh against him from both sides, sweating and panting the room reeked of sex. <br />
<br />
“Kayla?” Kyle panted<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” She said.<br />
<br />
“Are you really?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I&#39;m still me, but you&#39;re in control, I&#39;m just a passenger.” Kayla said.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry.” Kyle sighed “I..”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t be,” Kayla kissed him, “I love this, I get to be with you, and be you at the same time. This is amazing! We have to give Jen this gift back she&#39;ll love it!” She smiled. <br />
<br />
Kyle realized that she was telling the truth, Sheila was still in her body but under his control, save for when she was horny. Kyle thought to himself for a while.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t be sorry. Don&#39;t worry. I love this.” She kissed him, “I really do, I want you. I want us.” She continued to make out with him, he started to hear her thoughts in their shared minds, and realized that she really did want this. After another hour Kayla under Kyle&#39;s control got up and grabbed his hand, pulling him off the bed.<br />
<br />
“Awww, I wanted to snuggle.” Kayla said.<br />
<br />
“We need a shower, and since I have both bodies now, well...”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Mommy likes.” Kayla cooed, they made their way to the shower.</p>
