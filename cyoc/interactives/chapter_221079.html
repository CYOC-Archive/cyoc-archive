<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kim continued laying on the bed.  &quot;I&#39;m kind of tired.  I just want to lay here for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg sat up and looked back at Kim.  &quot;Oh, I know that feeling.  After a release, I&#39;m often pretty tired.  Five minutes and you&#39;ll be feeling back to normal, but it will probably take a bit longer before you&#39;re ready for a second round.  ...if that&#39;s what you&#39;re hoping for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim smiled.  &quot;Yeah, I definitely want to do that again before we swap back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg stood up and started walking toward the bathroom.  &quot;I need to pee.&quot;  As he hurried in, he asked Kim, &quot;Anything I should know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just sit and let it flow.&quot;  After the door closed, she added, &quot;Don&#39;t forget to wipe after!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Greg shouted from inside the bathroom.  He sat his new butt on the toilet seat and took in the new sensation.  Kim had a larger butt so it felt like he was sitting on more padding, but at the same time he could feel the seat.  He looked down and wondered what to do with his hands.  With no better option in mind, he laid them on his legs.<br />
<br />
As he waited and tried to figure out what muscles to relax to start peeing, he looked at his stomach.  There was a blurring between skin tones just below his belly button.  Kim&#39;s skin on his legs was a slightly lighter shade than his.  Where the swap happened seemed to be marked with this half inch area.  Above this area was Greg&#39;s hairy belly and some &quot;love handles&quot;.  Below the line immediately became thinner with less hair and softer skin.  With his mind distracted, he managed to pee with his new anatomy for the first time.  He recalled what Kim had reminded him and wiped himself.<br />
<br />
As he emerged from the bathroom, Kim ran in.  &quot;Going to clean myself up a bit.  I&#39;ll be out in a minute.&quot;  She hurried in and shut the door.<br />
<br />
Kim emerged from the bathroom to find Greg in a hotel bathrobe sitting on the end of the bed.  He looked at her and immediately explained himself.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure what to wear, so I figured I&#39;d just put this on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is there another?&quot; Kim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.  It&#39;s in the closet.&quot;  Greg pointed to the closet to Kim&#39;s left.  She slid the door open, pulled the robe off its hanger, and put it on.  As she tied the cloth belt, there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
Greg continued sitting on the bed and made sure the robe covered him properly while Kim went to the door and peeked out.  &quot;It&#39;s our champagne!&quot;  She opened the door and a young man in a hotel-branded polo shirt carried in a tray with a bottle of champagne, two champagne flutes, and a plate of assorted cheeses and crackers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like this on the desk?&quot; he asked Greg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that would be wonderful.  Thank you!&quot;  Greg reached into the pants which he had earlier failed to zip up and pulled his wallet from a pocket.  He took out a $5 bill and handed it as a tip which the young man graciously accepted before departing and leaving them alone.<br />
<br />
Greg unscrewed the wire over the champagne cork and pushed the cork out.  He poured two glasses and handed one to Kim.  &quot;Here&#39;s to my better half!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim laughed.  &quot;I see what you did there!&quot;  They sipped the champagne and kissed.<br />
<br />
As they enjoyed their champagne, Kim and Greg couldn&#39;t help but reflect on their unique situation. The body swap had been an unexpected twist during their vacation, but it had also brought them closer together in ways they never anticipated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who would have thought that our romantic getaway would turn into such an adventure?&quot; Kim said, her eyes sparkling with amusement.<br />
<br />
As the evening progressed, they savored the rest of the champagne, indulged in the delicious cheese and crackers, and shared stories and laughter.  After finishing his second glass of champagne, Greg had concern.  &quot;So, I just had a thought.  I&#39;ve got your...nether regions.  You weren&#39;t going to have your period anytime soon, were you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim chuckled at the thought of Greg having to experience that for once.  It might make him a bit more understanding in the future.  &quot;No, that probably wouldn&#39;t be until the end of next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg exhaled a sigh of relief.  &quot;Oh, good.  By then, we&#39;ll hopefully have found Marvin and swapped back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Although, that reminds me...&quot;  Kim got up and walked into the bathroom for a moment.  She returned holding a round pill.  &quot;You need to take this.&quot;  She held it out and offered it to Greg.<br />
<br />
Greg picked it up with his fingers and looked at it.  &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my birth control pill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg tried to give it back.  &quot;I can&#39;t take that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg, do you want to get pregnant?&quot; Kim asked, not taking back the pill.  &quot;You&#39;re obviously the one with the vagina.  We haven&#39;t done an x-ray on you, but I&#39;d be willing to bet that you&#39;ve also got my ovaries.  If you don&#39;t want to get pregnant, you need to take this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d only get pregnant if I had sex and I&#39;m not into guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim shook her head with disappointment.  &quot;Greg, there&#39;s a full set of daily pills that I need to take for birth control.  If that cycle is interrupted until Monday, then the whole set is shot.  You&#39;ve got to take these until I get my bottom half back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t that have estrogen in that?&quot; asked Greg out of concern.  &quot;Is that going to make me grow boobs and start to look like a woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple days of pills aren&#39;t going to turn you into a woman.  Transgender women have to take months of hormone replacement therapy and they don&#39;t start seeing effects until a few weeks in.  You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Kim reassured him.  &quot;Besides, with my ovaries you&#39;re already producing estrogen.  With your gonads, I&#39;m making testosterone.  Although as long as we change back Monday, there shouldn&#39;t be any changes to the other halves of our bodies.  Anyway, just take the pill.  Please.  You&#39;ll be fine and it&#39;ll help keep me from getting pregnant later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg hesitated, still unsure about taking Kim&#39;s birth control pills. The situation was already incredibly bizarre, and this added another layer of complexity. But as he looked into Kim&#39;s eyes, he saw the seriousness and concern in them. He realized that she was right—they needed to take every precaution to avoid any unwanted surprises during their body swap.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Greg reluctantly accepted the pill from Kim&#39;s outstretched hand. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll take it,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with uncertainty.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s face softened with gratitude, and she smiled at Greg. &quot;Thank you. I know it&#39;s a strange request, but it&#39;s important for both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg nodded, popping the pill into his mouth and taking a quick sip of champagne to wash it down. He couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of responsibility for their temporary shared body. It was a strange and unexpected role reversal, but he was determined to support Kim in any way he could.<br />
<br />
Kim moved over and sat next to Greg with their legs touching.  &quot;You know, I totally get that you don&#39;t want to have sex with a guy, but I&#39;m not a guy.  I&#39;m your wife.  I just so happen to have a penis and hairy legs at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg laughed and shook his head, but Kim continued.  &quot;If you think about it, it&#39;s really your own penis.  You&#39;re not having sex with some dude.  It&#39;s yourself.  So looking at it one way, you&#39;re having sex with your wife.  Looking at it the other way, you&#39;re having sex with yourself which makes it essentially masturbating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg fidgeted uncomfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna try?&quot; Kim suggested with a playful smile.  She put her champagne flute aside and wrapped her arm around his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Greg considered the proposition silently before looking into Kim&#39;s eyes.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s try it.&quot;  He started to take his bathrobe off.  &quot;But if this gets too weird, we&#39;ll stop, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim began to disrobe as well.  &quot;Agreed!&quot;  She pushed Greg&#39;s naked body back onto the bed.  &quot;I want to be on top.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg laid back and smiled.  He reached up with his right hand and ran his fingers through Kim&#39;s hair and pulled her in for a passionate kiss.  With his left hand, he began to fondle her breasts.<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s lips and tongue continued to intermingle with Greg&#39;s while she supported her body with her left arm and used her right arm to guide her penis into Greg&#39;s vagina.  As it entered, Greg&#39;s eyes opened wide and he smiled.  Kim managed to speak a breathy, &quot;I love you&quot; to Greg as she started moving back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; replied Greg.<br />
<br />
Kim pulled her lips away from Greg&#39;s and changed to a more upright position.  She inserted two fingers into Greg&#39;s vagina and began to stimulate him.  Greg ran his hands down the slender sides of Kim&#39;s body.  When he got to her waist and felt hair, the reality of the situation hit him.  He was feeling his own legs next to his body and could feel his own penis inside him...and it felt amazing as Kim sent an orgasm  rippling through his entire body.  Greg grabbed the sheets with his hands and arched his back slightly while bending his neck back to that he was looking at the headboard with his mouth wide open in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god.  Oh my god!&quot; Greg panted.  &quot;That was amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim smiled with pleasure as she looked down into his eyes.  &quot;My turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim pushed her pelvis into Greg&#39;s body and started moving in a slow rhythm.  &quot;Oh, this feels so good!&quot; she said.  Greg hummed in agreement.  It didn&#39;t take long until Kim froze and Greg knew she was cumming inside of him.  Worn out, Kim lowered her body on top of Greg.  &quot;Oh wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was amazing!  Thank you for talking me into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure...and I mean that.&quot;  Kim hummed and embraced Greg.  &quot;I hope we can do that again before we swap back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;d like that,&quot; said Greg.  &quot;I guess it&#39;s a good thing I took that pill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Although if you carried the baby to term, would you be the mother or the father?&quot; wondered Kim.<br />
<br />
Greg pondered the question.  &quot;I&#39;d imagine if I went at least nine months with your ovaries pumping me full of estrogen along with all the other body changes that come along with pregnancy, I&#39;d really be a mother.&quot;  Greg shivered.  &quot;What a scary thought!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s scary about that?&quot; asked Kim.  &quot;Women have been becoming mothers for as long as women have existed.  We said that maybe I&#39;d be a mother someday when we&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s scary for me,&quot; Greg admitted.  &quot;I&#39;ve spent my entire life as a guy, so to one day say, &#39;Hey, you&#39;re gonna pop out a baby!&#39;...yeah, that&#39;s scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I can see that.&quot;  Kim slowly pulled out of Greg, grabbed her robe, and headed to the bathroom.  &quot;I&#39;m going to clean up again and then get ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m just going to lay here in the afterglow for a minute and will see you there in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim and Greg proceeded to get ready for bed.  Kim had put on Greg&#39;s pajama bottoms with her satin pajama top and crawled into bed.  Greg had agreed to wear Kim&#39;s satin pajama shorts with one of his T-shirts.<br />
<br />
As Greg sat on the toilet before heading to bed, he looked down at his navel.  &quot;That&#39;s odd,&quot; he thought.  &quot;I could have sworn the line separating our bodies was just below the belly button, not just above it.&quot;  He tried to remember, but his mind was a bit cloudy from the champagne and the passionate sex.  After he finished, he turned out the light and joined Kim in bed to get a good night&#39;s sleep.</p>
