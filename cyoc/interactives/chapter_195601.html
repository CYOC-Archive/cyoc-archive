<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Grant woke up in a very comfortable spot. He had ben awake for a bit now, but he didn&#39;t want to disturb Tanner, whom he was resting his head on, fluffy chest fur against the shorter fur of his cheek. Just the barest hint of light came in through the window, and the TV still played on mute on the other end of the room from the movie they had been watching. The kangaroo had ben very respectful of his request they not move forward yet, but he had once against shown him what he could do with the right kisses and a little bit of ear tugging.<br />
<br />
<i>Tanner expertly played with the bundle of nerves right at the base of Grant&#39;s ears that kept the giant things moving, but also served as an unexpected  sensitive spot. A spot the kangaroo knew how to tease. Kisses rained down on his muzzle, muffling his soft moans. Grant could feel himself rock hard in his boxer-briefs, a damp spot moving out from the head of his rigid cock. Tanner left his lips, kissing his neck then snuffling through his chest fur until he found on of his nipples. He began to tease it with his lips and tongue as his fingers continued their erotic ear massage. Grant came, gasping and shuddering as he orgasmed without Tanner even looking at his cock.</i><br />
<br />
The memory made Grant&#39;s cock twitch again in the fresh pair of underwear he had donned after cleaning himself up, with a little help from Tanner. He had offered to return the favor but he kangaroo has insisted that Grant was supposed to be relaxing. As if what they had did hadn&#39;t almost worked him up into a frenzy.<br />
<br />
Their feet had stuck out from under the sheet during the nigh, and Grant couldn&#39;t help but smile a little. He had always thought he had big feet, being taller just meant bigger feet, but Tanner&#39;s were something else. He had thought them awkward looking at first, too big. But now they seemed just right and his looked oddly small in comparison. He rubbed the fur on top of Tanner&#39;s foot with the bottom of his, enjoying the softness under his toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.. good morning.&quot; Came Tanner&#39;s slightly groggy voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning.&quot; Grant replied, not even noticing his feet stretching out as he played footsie with the kangaroo. Pinkie toe shifting under his foot as his big toe pulled back letting the middle two push forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; Tanner&#39;s foot responded, pushing back against Grant&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little after 6:30.&quot; Thick pads formed under Grant&#39;s foot as his toenails narrowed into blunt claw tips, good for traction and a little digging but not much else.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to get showered and start breakfast for the guests.&quot; Tanner gave Grant a kiss on the muzzle and slipped out of bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I help?&quot; Grant asked, sitting up a little in the bed as his knees and ankles felt a bit strange, reworking themselves into a better form for his new hoppers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, if you can figure out how to walk by then. And get down the stairs. Hint, you gotta go a little sideways on the steps, they&#39;re not made for long feet usually.&quot; Tanner was smirking, nodding towards the bottom of the bed. Grant noticed just in time to see the grey speckled brown fur shooting up his feet, feeling it taper out above his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can manage.&quot; Grant replied, a touch sarcastically before a kiss shut him up. This was a very nice way to wake up.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Benny stretched. It felt like he hadn&#39;t moved in days. Every muscle in his body was stiff as a board. He rubbed at his face as he looked around. Why did his hand feel so weird? He opened his eyes to look at it. Pink, five fingered. It was wrong. It was too big.. no.. that&#39;s not what was wrong, it was furless, and there were too many fingers. Way too many fingers. It felt like he had little twigs on his hand rather than good solid digits. How did some anthros put up with that? He started checking himself out, prodding with the hand. If that was wrong..<br />
<br />
&quot;Doc! He&#39;s up!&quot; Came a call from a chair in the room. Benny looked over to see Sheriff Niles getting out of the chair to come check on him. His head was pounding, worse than any hangover he had ever had. Even that time his brother had egged him into seeing how many tequila shots he could put away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss?&quot; The word had Nile&#39;s ears twitching for a moment, his brow furrowing. &quot;Where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hospital. Doc&#39;s on his way, just give him a moment, he&#39;ll explain everything. Can I get you something?&quot; Niles was being mothering. It had to be bad. The jackal was good as bosses went, but he didn&#39;t mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss? Where the fuck is my dick?&quot; Benny said, suddenly startled as he couldn&#39;t find it. Not the question he would normally have asked the sheriff, nor in the way he would have, but it spilled out once his hand found nothing between his legs. Or almost nothing. Luckily, Niles looked amused. Wait! Amused?! At Benny being castrated! He gave a little snort of agitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Important questions first I see.&quot; Dr Schnauf stated as he stepped into the room, giving Benny a cursory once over. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be back soon. Probably by the end of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor came and looked at the monitor hooked up to the wires on Benny, checking his vitals before pulling a flashlight out of his pocket. &quot;Can you tell me your full name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Benjamin Long.&quot; He replied, leaving his middle name out. Most were fine with that. He had out lucked his brother there. &quot;Doc, what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll get to that in a second. Residence and occupation.&quot; Light flashed across Benny&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;64 Hoof St, deputy, my boss is right there.&quot; That got another curious expression out of Niles, as if the jackal was trying to recall something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the last thing you remember?&quot; Schnauf tucked the flashlight back in his pocket, making some notes on his clipboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something at the boundary. Disturbance. The sheriff sent us out to check it out. A bang.. then.&quot; Benny frowned and looked down at his hand. &quot;No, last thing I remember is Grant, he was here wasn&#39;t he? Visited?&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor pulled up a chair and sat down next to the bed. &quot;There was an incident in the boundary. The Valley reacted to someone it didn&#39;t want crossing. You got caught in it and partially changed. Don&#39;t worry, your anthro self is asserting itself, and quickly. You should be completely yourself by tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, normally when the town crosses I don&#39;t end up..&quot; He&#39;d lived in this town since he came here for college, he stayed through a few crossings, he knew his human self. Big and burly with curly red hair, not.. &quot;Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, you got caught in something. You should take your normal human look at the next crossing. This is just temporary, I&#39;m sure.&quot; The doctor tried to sound reassuring, but Benny could hear those unspoken maybes in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss, you can&#39;t let the guys know. They&#39;ll never let it drop. Wait, at the boundary.. they know. Aww.. man.&quot; He put his hands over his face and moaned a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t say a thing.&quot; Niles promised. &quot;Get some rest. Grant promised to stop by later to check on you.&quot; That perked Benny right up. It had been a long time since he had seen his brother in person, the brief visit earlier not withstanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s he staying? I was supposed to meet him when he got into town, but..&quot; Benny looked around, trying to put memories together but the whole last week seemed a fuzz.<br />
<br />
Niles looked at him. &quot;The Hop On Inn, Tanner&#39;s place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh.&quot; Benny mumbled, trying not to smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Problem?&quot; Niles asked, suddenly sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only that that kangaroo is going to have my brother wrapped around his little finger in no time. I know my brother, and that&#39;s just his type of guy.&quot; Benny grinned. &quot;Oh I can&#39;t wait to see this.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Full fledged memories. He knows the personality of some townsfolk and his own brother without even really meeting them. I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m starting to remember him being here for years working with you.&quot; Raymond rubbed the bridge of his muzzle. In all his time here in the Valley he had never had memories inserted in his own head. At least he had the experience to help some through it now.<br />
<br />
Niles looked more than a little shell-shocked. Though he had been through this before when he came here for college. Raymond remembered his friend and roommate from back then. Bookish, scrawny, jumping at almost every noise. Then becoming the confident, self-assured jackal. It had been fascinating to watch. Niles nodded his head. &quot;I can remember, it&#39;s jut like then. The old ones are fuzzy and I have to think about it, but I can remember him being here, too. This is gonna affect more than half the Valley. Inserting a whole resident of several years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most probably won&#39;t even notice. The families on this side usually don&#39;t.&quot; Raymond added in. &quot;I think we do only because we know to look for it. I say address the problem if it comes up, otherwise let it lie. We still need to bring in Max though. See if that triggers anything. We don&#39;t need a melt down from Benny if they accidentally bump into each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; Niles said with a nod. &quot;I&#39;ll phone up Oakton, let him know he&#39;s awake.&quot;</p>
