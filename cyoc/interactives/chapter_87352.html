<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily looked around the audience and wondered who else she should hypnotize on stage. With a whole lot of people in front of her, it was hard for her to decide. After looking around, she spotted a father and son sitting close to her. Pointing to them, she told them, &quot;How about you two? Come up on stage please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The father nodded and he and his son came up on stage next to Lesily. Once they were on stage, Lesily took a look at the two. The father looks like he&#39;s in his mid thirties with dark hair with a couple of gray streaks on his sides. He was pretty tall, like around 5&#39;7 with a nice muscular build. His face was a little rugged but it was still a little young for his look with brown eyes, a pointed chin, and a bit of stubble on his face. He was wearing a bottomed up Hawaiian shirt, a pair of cargo shorts that goes down below his knees, and a pair of beach sandals.<br />
<br />
Next to him is a boy that&#39;s five-years-old. He&#39;s just 3&#39;5 with a little baby fat left over and his stomach was a little plump. His face was completely round as his cheeks were puffy and aqua blue eyes were gleaming, with his black hair looking all childish and fluffy. He was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Diego from the show Go, Diego, Go, blue jean shorts, and a pair of Diego sneakers with anklet socks.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked at the two and was pleased with them. &quot;Now tell me, what are your names?&quot; she asked in wonderment. The man looked at her and answered, &quot;My name is Joshua Rodriguez. And this is my son Daniel, or Dan for short.&quot; Little Dan looked at the performer and waved to her, saying, &quot;Hi!&quot; Lesily waved back and had a happy expression on her face. Looking back at the father, she then said, &quot;So Josh, what brings you here to the resort?&quot; Josh smiled and answer, &quot;Well, I want to take my son to someplace fun. I heard this place can change your age into whatever you dream of and though maybe this will be good for my son since he has a wide variety of imagination. This is our first day here and we are getting started getting comfortable around here. And who knows, maybe this would give us a chance to bond more.&quot; Lesily listened in and couldn&#39;t help but to feel delighted by this tender moment. &quot;Aw...&quot; she said in pure happiness, &quot;Isn&#39;t that sweet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to her audience, she explained to them what she was listening to. &quot;As you can see ladies and gentlemen, this father and son are trying to bond like any other father and son. They came to the island to have some fun and maybe change ages to get closer. You know, since this is their first day here, let&#39;s give them a something they would remember for a long time.&quot; She then took out her pendent and turned to the two to begin the next performance. &quot;All right boys&quot;, she then said to them, &quot;I want you to look into my pendent. When you do that, I want you to fall into a deep sleep and listen to my voice. Now watch the pendant...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two looked at the pendant and starred at it for a few minutes. Upon starring at it, their eyes were slowly starting to get heavy as their eyelids slowly closed. Once they closed, they went to a deep sleep standing up. Lesily looked on and could tell that phase one is done. Once the two were asleep, Lesily turned to the audience and told them what she&#39;s going to do next. &quot;Now these two are asleep and I&#39;m in complete control over them. Now being that this is the son&#39;s first time here, I think I would give him a little taste at what&#39;s going to come. But first, let me speak to the father about one more thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to Josh, she asked, &quot;Now Josh, you are asleep, but you can still hear me. Correct?&quot; The father slowly nodded as he heard every word she said. &quot;Good.&quot; she then said, &quot;So tell me Josh, are you two the only family in this resort?&quot; The father then responded in a hypnotic tone, &quot;Yes. Only my son and I came to the resort to have a little fun.&quot; &quot;What about you wife, your son&#39;s mother.&quot; she then asked, &quot;Is she here with you?&quot; Josh felt a little depressed and said to her, &quot;Sadly no. You see, my wife died after giving birth to Daniel. Something about a vessel in her brain snapped and killed her in a matter of minutes. Now it&#39;s only me and my son getting along. But it&#39;s hard for me since I have to balance work with my son. I just hope that this vacation will make our bond stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was shocked by what they heard from the father. Even Will and Tia heard that too and were surprised by this as well. For Will he couldn&#39;t believe it, for Tia, she was saddened by that lost. &quot;Aww... That&#39;s so sad.&quot; Ã¢&quot;Yeah...&quot; Will said, &quot;Never expect that coming at all.&quot; But Lesily rubber her chin and found that quite unique saying, &quot;Hmm... Very interesting. And does your son know of her mother&#39;s death?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; was the answer he gave her, &quot;Not yet at least. Dan is still too young to know of her death. Sometimes a lied to him that his mother left us and would never return again. I&#39;m hoping that when he&#39;s older, I will tell him the truth. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily nodded and could tell that Josh wanted to keep this secret from his son until it was time. Now that she was done talking to him, she went to his son and wondered a few things herself. Lowering to his lever, she asked him, &quot;So Daniel, please tell me. What do you think of your father?&quot; Daniel heard her and responded in a blank but childish voice. &quot;I think my daddy is the best daddy in the world! Though he never had time for me cause he is working, he always loved me and take good care of me. Though I wish mommy was here. Daddy always said that she went away for a long time and she won&#39;t come back anytime soon.&quot; Lesily rubbed her chin and said to herself, &quot;Oh boy, you have no idea. So Dan, do you ever wonder what it&#39;s like to be a grown up?&quot; Daniel shook his head and was a little nervous. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; he answered, &quot;I think it&#39;s a little scary not being able to play and have fun.&quot; &quot;Oh it&#39;s not scary.&quot; Lesily responded, &quot;In fact, it&#39;s quite special. I&#39;ll tell you what we can do. Why don&#39;t we play a little game? I&#39;m going to say a number and when you hear it, you will grow to that number both of body and mind. Are you ready?&quot; Daniel nodded to himself and was ready to play this game. Smiling to herself, Lesily looked at him deeply and said, &quot;All right then, let&#39;s begin. Let&#39;s start with seven.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment she said that, Dan started to age to seven years of age. Though not much has changed, his height grew a little bit, almost 3&#39;9 to be exact. All the remaining baby fat was long gone, as his body had gotten thin and lanky while his cheeks on his face look less puffy. His hair was a little shorter and looked like it was cut recently. His clothes started to change slowly as he was now wearing a red T-Shirt showing the logo of Autobots, blue jeans that go down to his ankles, and a pair of sneakers with the Autobots logo on it. On top of his head is a red cap that was showing the same Autobots logo as his T-Shirt and shoes and a baseball glove appeared on his left hand.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked on and could tell that Dan had become a little kid now. Getting close to him, she said, &quot;So Dan, how old are you?&quot; Dan was still in a trance as he said, &quot;I&#39;m seven years old.&quot; &quot;And what are you doing today?&quot; asked the performer. Dan answered, &quot;I&#39;m going to play catch with my dad. We usually play it almost everyday.&quot; &quot;I see...&quot; was Lesily&#39;s response. &quot;Now let&#39;s see what you look like at ten years of age.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the second time, Daniel aged up to that age. His height grew substantially as he was over the four-foot mark. His body remained skinny, but his arms and legs grew to match his height. His clothes then changed to a gray polo shirt, dark blue jeans, and Nike sneakers while his cap and baseball glove disappeared.<br />
<br />
Looking at the changes, Lesily noticed that he was about to enter teendom. So she walked to him and said, &quot;Daniel, can you hear me? What is you age now?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m ten.&quot; was Dan&#39;s answer. &quot;And what are you doing today?&quot; she continued. &quot;I&#39;m getting ready for school. I promise dad that I would study hard to get the best grade. When I grow up, I&#39;m going to be a lawyer to help bring justice to the innocent and to put bad guys in jail.&quot; Lesily smirked and nodded in approval. &quot;That is great!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;Now move forward to thirteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel grew bigger as he had another growth spurt. He sprouted like a weed, as he was almost five feet. Just as he was growing, puberty is starting to take over. Lesily looked on and notice his arms and legs growing and slowly gaining a little bit of muscle on them. She also notices his face starting to mature and grow harder. His hair continued to change styles over the years and now looked like a look for young teens. His clothes then alter to a black T-shirt with a skull and crossbones on it, faded blue jeans that were ripped on the knees, and a pair of Converse shoes.<br />
<br />
When the changes are finished, Lesily looked at the son and said, &quot;What is your age now Daniel?&quot; Dan then responded in a voice that was a little older, &quot;I&#39;m thirteen.&quot; Then Lesily asked, &quot;And how are you feeling?&quot; The son shrugged and said, &quot;A little weird I guess. Dad said I am going through changes in my body. Changes that would transcend me into an adult. It seem scary at first, but dad told me to give it a few months and it will be normal.&quot; His voice cracked a little bit as his Adams apple is still in development. Lesily just chuckled a little bit, knowing that this boy is still getting use to puberty, but he has a long way to go. &quot;Oh, you poor boy...&quot; she said to ease him. &quot;Let me help you with that. Seventeen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once more, Daniel sprouted up real fast. He was now over five feet tall and his body continued to gain muscles over the years of working out and staying fit. His body looks athletically fit and he looked like a young teenage stud. The performer also saw little hairs growing out of his arms and legs and was maturing by the second. His face was getting more masculine as his jaw line became broader and his looks less innocent. His hair grew even shorter as it became a buzz cut while peach fuzz grew on his chin. As he grows, his clothes changed more drastically. Now he was wearing a black suit with a dark blue tie and his hair was kept neat and he was wearing black shoes.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked on and wondered why he was wearing a suit. But that&#39;s when she noticed him crying a little bit and the tears came down his cheeks. He could even hear him speak up privately. &quot;Mom... sniff... Why did you have to die after I was born? We would.ve been a family together. Why...&quot; After listening to Daniel, she understood what he was talking about. Turning to her audience she said, &quot;Looks like he&#39;s at the age where he now knows of his mother&#39;s death. And judging by what he&#39;s wearing, he must be at his mother&#39;s grave. This is a little bit awkward. Better fix this a quick.&quot; Turning to him, she then said, &quot;All right Daniel, Time to enter twenty one.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so he aged up to twenty-one. When he reached up past to five feet, he stopped growing and remained like that for the rest of the progression. But there were other changes that were happening and turned him into a young adult. The muscles on his arms and legs were well toned and briefly tanned, making him look like someone from a male super model magazine. If Daniel hadn&#39;t had a shirt, she would&#39;ve been his manly pecs with chest hair sprinkled on top of it or his stomach that was showing off his 6-pack abs. His face belonged to that of a handsome young man with grizzled looks and a hardening jaw line. All of his hair grew back in and it was styled more mature like. Even his clothes looked more mature as he was wearing a college uniform with a blue vest and tie, blue cargo pants, and dress shoes.<br />
<br />
After the changes were finished, Lesily looked on and could tell that Dan had changed a lot more then before. In fact, he dressed like he was in some form of college. Wondering about that, she looked at him, which he was on her level, and said, &quot;Daniel, what is your age this time?&quot; Daniel&#39;s response is with a manly voice saying, &quot;I&#39;m 21-years-old today.&quot; &quot;And I could tell you are wearing a standard school uniform.&quot; She then said, &quot;Tell me, what school do you go to.&quot; There was a bit of silence until Dan spoke up in the most professional way. &quot;Why, I go to the Law School at New York University. I promise my dad when I grow up I want to be a lawyer and now I&#39;m following that path. NYU&#39;s Law School has the best facilities that will teach me what I need to be a professional lawyer. I can&#39;t wait to graduate so I can defend the innocent.&quot; Lesily smirked to herself and said, &quot;Maybe not... Go up to 25.&quot;<br />
<br />
So with that said, Daniel aged up to that year. So far, not much has changed in him since he had mature to an adult male, but there were other changes taking place. She could see his hair go in and out under a couple of occasions when he had many haircuts at the salon. His outfit changed back and forth from his uniform to casual clothing. When he reached to the age of twenty-five, he was now wearing a black graduation cap and gown, meaning that he graduated from law school.<br />
<br />
With the changes finished, Lesily then said, &quot;Now how old you are Dan?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m twenty five.&quot; he said. She then asked, &quot;And are you graduating from NYU?&quot; Daniel&#39;s response was, &quot;Yes. Today is the day I graduate from law school. Got myself a degree in Business and a Ph.D. in Law and Society. This is by far the best day in my life. Sure wish mom were here to see this though. She should&#39;ve been happy to see me graduate.&quot; Lesily looked on and could tell that he was happy with that. &quot;That&#39;s good to hear.&quot; She then said, &quot;Now, age to twenty eight.&quot;<br />
<br />
One final time, Daniel aged up to that year. Again, not much in physical changes, but his clothes started to look more professional. He was now wearing a gray suit with a tie to match and a buttoned white long sleeve shirt underneath with a pair of black dress shoes. In his hand, he was holding a brief case and he looked like he was ready to go to work. Heck, Lesily looked at him and could tell that he almost looked like his father, with the exception of aqua blue eyes with his dad&#39;s brown eyes.<br />
<br />
As the last of the changes were finished, she headed to him and said, &quot;Now Daniel, I want to know your age now and what job you&#39;re in.&quot; He was quiet for a little bit until he spoke up. &quot;Well I&#39;m twenty eight and I got a case to take care of. I&#39;ve been quite busy as of late. I already have four cases this month and had to meet up with those who are suing companies for safety reasons and low payment. It&#39;s always something with these people. Wish I could get myself a little break. All these people are going to drive me crazy!&quot;<br />
<br />
When he finished saying all of that, Lesily turned to the audience and said, &quot;There you have it folks. With my magic, I turned this cute little boy into a grown man. And a handsome young man I do say so myself.&quot; Everyone applaud that performance and enjoyed seeing the boy grow up before their very eyes. Tia looked at the young man and felt a little flushed by how he transformed. Will on the other hand, looked at her then back to him and felt a little bit jealous. Once the audience finished applauding, Lesily turned to Dan&#39;s father and wondered what he&#39;s going to do with him since she hadn&#39;t touched him yet. &quot;Hmm... Now let&#39;s see,&quot; she then said toherself, &quot;What shall I do with you?&quot;</p>
