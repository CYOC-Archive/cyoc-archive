<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake rested partially on his side and stared at the fourteen year year old girl, Tess, who gazed back at him from the other side of the mirror. Gazing at the teenage body that he had slowly developed since his encounter with the amulet, he found that even though he had said ten months and it was now a little over twelve months, the biggest reason for choosing the change still eluded him.<br />
<br />
He had never wanted to be a girl. Yet, in his previous life, when he had been a guy he had had questions about the differences between the two sexes and felt like something in his life was missing. He had gone to great lengths to try and solve the problem as to whether if it was biological, sociological, psychological, a combine, or something else that separated the two sexes. Peering at his naked reflection, studying the round feminine face, the hair that came down the shoulder, the taut young A cup breast with the nipples that always seemed to be hard and his flat stomach, he considered how he could easily change back, as he still had the amulet that had somehow transformed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not ready,&quot; he thought as he also decided that it wasn&#39;t simply that he didn&#39;t have the answer to his question yet, nor that, for reasons he could explain, he liked being Tess, but because of something else.<br />
<br />
He understood perfectly what the other reason was and as he stared at his reflection, he prepared himself to look upon a part of his body he had forced himself not to look at for some time. Studying the subtle hints his teenage body was already displaying its march toward womanhood, including the barest traces of an hourglass figure and the ways puberty was causing his body to change, including in the hips, butt and thighs, which had started to go from the general flat look a lot of prepubescent children had to something that was more pronounced, Drake sighed and shifted on the bean-bag chair he was lying on. Feeling the material press into the his butt and the area between his legs, he tried to ignore what else he felt as he leaned back and spread his legs. Grasping his knees, he shifted a bit more until he could see the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
What he could see was the other reason he felt that he was still not ready to change back, even though he felt that he should. Peering at the semi-formed pinkish-white gash, knowing that if he spread it he would see the normal vagina entrance, Drake instead looked at the other part of his genitals, which happened to be the last traces of his masculinity. Barely a nub, but clearly leaving no doubt of what it was, and had been, was the last vestiges of his dick. He did not understand why it hadn&#39;t transformed yet like the rest of his body, and felt certain it would eventually do so, but off all the gradual changes that had happened, his cock&#39;s transformation was the slowest, leaving him with the sensation that he would probably not truly be able to find the answer he sought until it had morphed fully into a girl&#39;s clit, clit hood, and urethra. Feeling his hold on his knees start to slip, Drake huffed in agitation that he still had a penis, thought it was both stupid that only he could see it and slight blessing that only he was able to see it, then shifted until he was sitting lotus style, his teeny, tiny penis pressing into the bean-bag chair, and stared at the girl he had, for all intents and purposes, changed into.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really should transform back,&quot; he muttered after a moment, then found himself doubting that was a good idea, as he still didn&#39;t have the resolution he sought. Standing, holding his legs clamped tightly closed, unable to see any hint of his dick, he asked himself, &quot;Would it be so bad to stay as Tess?&quot; before thinking of the past thirteen, fourteen months and what he had learned.<br />
<br />
The first that came to mind was Cecilia, who was not only his best friend, but also his girlfriend. Their love for each other had grown stronger since they had finally admitted their feelings for each other and it seemed like nothing at the moment could separate them. Yet, Drake had a sinking sensation that his changing back would be the thing that drove them apart and he wondered what would happen to the other girl if he made, what he deemed in this situation, a selfish choice and became his normal, thirty-six-year-old self. Thinking about her, and all they loved doing together, and how nothing drove a wedge between them, he found himself staring at his torso, the missing teats and wondering about that instead.<br />
<br />
It took him another three months to figure out why he had four extra nipples. And when he did, it was such a brutal discovery, he almost changed back as soon as he was able to. Starting with a slight pain in his tailbone, and continuing on to other issues including a sharpening of his sense of smell and hearing, as well as odd hunger cravings, usually for raw meat, it eventually coalesced into him awakening to find he had undergone another transformation. Finding that he had morphed into a dog, and not one like he had been, somewhere between being a girl and a boy, but rather a bitch in heat, Drake had been terrified and that something had gone wrong. And then his mother had found him and things went even weirder from there as he found out it was a extremely rare condition only certain people, all girls, undergo, and that, of his family, only his aunt Grace had the same condition.<br />
<br />
Now, as he stood and turned away from the mirror, Drake better understood why he had four extra nipples every so often, why nobody said anything about it, and why Diana, after a couple months of snide comments, eventually admitted that Drake, as Tess, was lucky in that he would never experience a lot of the discomforts of having a period. Thinking about the dog he could transform into, and sometimes did without meaning to, as his control was still not the best, how he spent a month or two with his aunt Grace learning to master control over his changes, Cecilia, and everything else that he had learned whilst being Tess, and found he still didn&#39;t know if he was ready to go back to being Drake, even though he felt that he should. Looking down at his small, female build, which was at least two sizes smaller than the average girl of fourteen, Drake sighed and headed for his dresser. Figuring, that since it was still winter break, and that he had at least another week and a half before returning to school, he would try and reach a decision by the end of the break. Taking from the drawers a pair of black sweats, a bra that clasped in the front, a black sweatshirt that had the logo of a big name university printed on it, a pair of panties that were white with a strawberry print and a pair of socks, he began to dress.<br />
<br />
As he did this, Drake took a series of deep breathes and allowed himself to slip back into the female frame of mind. Reminding herself that, for the moment, she was Tess and that she was fourteen years old, having celebrated her birthday back in September, she thought all the things she did that stated she was a girl and the memories she had that confirmed this. Her thoughts shifting subtly, but still thinking of the choice she faced, Tess turned away from the dresser and headed across the room, deciding that, after breakfast, she give Cecilia a call and seeing if the other girl wanted to hang out.</p>
