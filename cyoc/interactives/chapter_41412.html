<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was a little taken aback. But whether his interest was out of professional interest or personal, I was only too willing to oblige. I dropped my pants, revealing my erect member. “Shit, man, that’s like six inches or something!” He looked back at my face, and I smiled under his eyes. “You should make it even bigger!”<br />
“What?”<br />
“No, seriously, I mean, you’ve still got the juices flowing, let me see you do it!”<br />
Though a little nervous, I put my hand around my dick and squeezed it. After a few seconds, I felt it getting bigger again.<br />
Brandon was watching it slowly engorge, his hand over his mouth in disbelief. He leaned in closer. I released my cock and looked down at it. If it wasn’t at seven inches, it wasn’t far from it.<br />
“Man,” he shook his head, “that’s gotta be the hottest fucking thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”<br />
Before I even knew what was happening, he put his hand on my hips, got on his knees, and shoved his mouth over my cock, dousing it in spit and running his lips back and forth, his tongue up and down my shaft. I’d been sucked off before, but between Brandon’s talented tonsils and the new size of my own dick, the sensations were overwhelming. I put my hand on the back of his head, guiding his motions as I reached climax. I looked down at him, and convinced myself again that I was dreaming. I closed my eyes, reared my head back, and came in his mouth.<br />
It was all I could do to keep my footing. Even so, I fell back, leaning on the massage table. I looked at Brandon.<br />
He had a huge goofy smile on his face, wiping my semen from his chin, and the whole thing was framed by his hair, now as long as it was when I saw him before the accident.<br />
“I’ve been wanting to do that for, like… a year and a half,” he said, brushing his suddenly-longer bangs from his eyes. He ran his hand through his thick hair and giggled. He shook his head. “Man, this is fucking comic book shit, right here.”<br />
I laughed. “What the hell kind of comic books do you read?” I stood up.<br />
Brandon stepped up to me. “Do me,” he said.<br />
“Just give me a minute…”<br />
“No, I mean, like… grow me. Make me bigger.”<br />
I stared at him, almost agape. This was beyond comic book shit, this was wildest fantasy shit. The man of my dreams, after having just given me the blow job of a lifetime, was now asking me if he could fulfill my most hopeless of hopes.<br />
I kneeled down on the floor, and pulled him with me. We kissed, undressing each other as we went.<br />
“You got condoms?” he asked.<br />
“Well, sort of… I don’t think they’ll fit anymore.”<br />
He laughed, kissing me on the cheek. “I’ll risk it if you’ll risk it.”<br />
He ran his hand through my hair, I ran mine down his taut back. He tickled my spine, and my stomach, finally finding his way to my crotch. He fluttered his fingertips over my penis, and I felt it begin to stir. He grabbed my balls and tickled them, sending more blood to my cock. It wasn’t long before I was good to go.<br />
Quickly, I turned him about, and guided my dick down his ass. He gasped, and threw his arms behind us, leaning back into me and cupping my own ass in his hands. I found his asshole and began undulating into him. The sensation was so amazing I nearly lost all concentration. I had a job to do.<br />
I reached forward, and hugged him close to me, feeling his toned back against me. I ran my hands along his chest, giving him the best massage I could muster. It wasn’t long before I felt his chest begin to puff up under my palms.<br />
“Oh god!” he cried out. “Oh my fucking Christ this is so… fucking…”<br />
He leaned his head back, and I kissed the back of it, moving my hands now down his arms, paying particular attention to his biceps. They began to get tense, more toned, as well, and I moved my hands back to his chest – I’ve always been a sucker for good pecs.<br />
I felt my head bulge within him, and knew that I was going to cum soon. Quickly, I moved my hands to his already formidable dick, stiff as a phone pole, and gave it a few swift strokes before I exploded inside him.<br />
We both cried out and I hugged him close, convulsing as one pump after another shot load after load into his ass. When finally I was empty, I collapsed backward onto the floor, letting the tingles of both orgasmic aftershock and sultry anticipation play on every square inch of my skin. I heard him stand up.<br />
“Holy fucking shit…”<br />
I opened my eyes. He had his back to me. And as pleased as I was with yesterday’s handiwork, I couldn’t wait any longer. “Turn around,” I whispered.<br />
He glanced back, smiled, and then turned about.<br />
If I hadn’t just emptied a cement truck of cum into his ass, I think I would’ve showered him in the stuff right then and there. His chest was amazing. His pecs bulged out of his chest like balloons. He ran his finger down the deep rivet between them and giggled. Then, with a grin, he raised both arms and struck a fierce double-bicep flex, showing off his newly acquired softball-sized guns. And though I hadn’t gotten a good look at it before, I knew merely from checking out his bulge that his cock, still dripping jizz from his own orgasm, had gone up a size, too. The whole thing was so magnificent and unbelievable I thought I was going to have a stroke or something. And I might as well have, since I just stared agape at his face, glistening with sweat and grinning with the same disbelief I had. I tried to talk, but all I managed was a few consonants.<br />
He flexed his right arm hard and ran his left hand over his bulging bicep. “I’m such a fucking pussy, Julian,” he said, staring at his muscles. “I’ve wanted you ever since I started coming here. I even started working out more often just to have an excuse to come here more often.”<br />
I laughed aloud. “Well then I guess that’s just one more thing we have in common. I’ve been developing new and original ways to hide my raging hardon from you for over a year, now.”<br />
He got on his knees again, grabbed my arm and pulled me forward. He moaned happily. “It was nice to finally be able to touch you back.”<br />
“Not to mention…” I ran my hand over his rock hard left pec with a smirk.<br />
He grinned. “Yeah, that was pretty nice too.” He blushed. “When I found out you had closed down, I stopped working out, almost completely. Dropped, like, twenty pounds in two months. Now, thanks to you, I probably just made it all back. And I did it by having the best fucking sex of my entire life.”<br />
We kissed again. I made to cup his head but put my hands on the floor.<br />
We separated, and then he shifted over to my side, and we lay together naked on the floor of my office.<br />
“So…” I began slowly, “what are we gonna do about…well, all of this?”<br />
Brandon sighed. “Buy some new shirts, I guess.”</p>
