Ryan Says Look Dude Let&#39;s Just Switch Dates, You Can Hit Up Macy While Make The Moves On Jess... <br />
<br />
Billy Says &quot;Good Luck&quot; He Says Mockingly Then Follow Up With &quot;She&#39;s Clearly Not Here For A Date!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan Says &quot;Watch Me!&quot; Ryan Was Talking Big But Now He Needed To Prove Himself Not Wanting To Look Bad After Talking Shit He Edits, Jess&#39;s Profile.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s Mental Section&quot;<br />
Mental<br />
Iq-90<br />
Libido-High<br />
Preference - Boys<br />
Mood - Disinterested Because She Got Stuck With The Loser Guy, Is Totally Crushing On Ryan<br />
Awareness-On<br />
<br />
Ryan Closes The Device After Hitting Enter. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Back At The Table... Shortly After Billy And Ryan Left...<br />
<br />
Macy Turns To Jess And Says &quot;What The Hell Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Come On, What Are You Trying To Do?&quot; Macy Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;I Don&#39;t Know What Are You Talking About, I&#39;ve Done Nothing?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, You&#39;re Just Gonna Sulk The Whole Time This Is Supposed To Be A Date Have Some Fun...&quot; Macy Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Macy I Just Don&#39;t Think I&#39;m Ready To Date&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess Come On You&#39;ve Been My Best Friend Forever, Even If You Don&#39;t End Up Liking Him... Just Enjoy The Date... Seriously What&#39;s So Bad<br />
About Hanging Out And Having Our Meals Paid For... And All You Have To Do Is... Not Look So Dead Inside... Trust Me If You Do You&#39;ll End <br />
Up Having Fun!&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I Can&#39;t Promise Anything... But I&#39;ll Try Macy&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank You, By The Way The Boy Probably Didn&#39;t Leave Because Of Drinks It Was Probably Because You Were So Disinterested... And<br />
They&#39;re Thinking Up A Game Plan... So When They Get Back Apologize And Say That You Had An Upset Stomach And Our Feeling Much Better&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
At That Moment, Ryan Hits Enter And The Two Boys Return With Drinks <br />
<br />
Ryan Says &quot;Look Ladies, I Know It&#39;s Sudden But Let&#39;s Try Switching Partners, I&#39;ll Go With Jess, And Macy  Your With Billy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Macy Gives Him A Confused Look But Then Notices Jess Seem To Brighten Up Hearing That, Macy Then Thinks Jess Wasn&#39;t Being A Downer, She Was Just Being Down In The Dumps Because She Preferred Ryan. Macy Smiles And Thinks She&#39;ll Take One For The Team And Date Ryan And Let Jess Enjoy Herself With Ryan And Says &quot;Actually, That&#39;s Better With Me!&quot; She Says Placing Her Hands On Billy&#39;s Hand<br />
<br />
Jess After Hearing That She Would Be Paired Up With Ryan Smiles, Not Because She Wanted To Date Him Because She Didn&#39;t But If She Was Going To Date Either Of Them, Which She Wouldn&#39;t But If She Would It Would Have To Be The Better Looking One Right, Not That She Was Into Him Or Anything But If She Were Into Guys Which She&#39;s Not, Ryan Would Totally Be Her Type, Which He Isn&#39;t (Jess&#39;s Thoughts Desperately Trying To Deny The Fact That She Was Actually Excited For The Date)<br />
<br />
As Macy And Billy Start Talking While Eating, Jess Turns To Ryan And Says &quot;I&#39;m Sorry For How I&#39;ve Acting Earlier... I&#39;ve Had A Lot On My Mind Lately And Kinda Put It Off On Billy, I&#39;m Sorry... I Hope At Least The Two Of Us Can Still Have Fun Tonight&quot; She Says Holding Out Her Hand, Hoping He&#39;d Forgive Her<br />
<br />
Ryan Looks At Jess&#39;s Hand And Takes It And Says &quot;Don&#39;t Worry About It...&quot; He Says Before Turning To Billy And Saying &quot;Right, Billy&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy Turns Away From Macy And Says &quot;Huh What?&quot; He Says Clearly Lost In His Own Conversation With Macy<br />
<br />
Ryan Just Rolls His Eyes And Says &quot;Never Mind&quot; He Says Before Turning Back To Jess Saying &quot;Let&#39;s Have Fun Tonight&quot; He Says While Shaking Her Hand<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; Jess Says Excitedly Smiling As They Start Eating, While The Other Two Continued Their Conversation...The More Jess Learned About Ryan The More She Felt Her Heart Beat Fast, She Could Feel Herself Blushing Whenever He Spoke...She Was Laughing At All Of His Jokes, Most Of Which Were Only Slightly Funny, But She Wasn&#39;t Fake Laughing...This Was So Embarrassing And Yet It Was Kind Of Exciting Too...But She Knew This Wasn&#39;t Her...It Was Some Stupid Computer Glitch It Had To Be That Or Being A Female Just Makes You Act Like This, Yeah That Had To Be It Being A Girl Was Messing With Her Mind And Making Her Act Like This If She Was A Guy There&#39;s No Way Right?! But Even Knowing That, She Couldn&#39;t Help But Enjoy Herself...Even Though It Was Weird Since She Was Supposed To Be A Guy...She Really Shouldn&#39;t Be Attracted To Guys...Especially Not This One, But She Is...At Least For Now...She Hopes It Will Go Away Once She Changes Back, But Right Now She Can&#39;t Really Imagine Going Back To Being A Guy And Just Friends With Ryan After All of This..<br />
<br />
The Rest Of The Meal They Talked Laughed And Flirted Though It Was Mostly Unintentional When Coming From Jess, But She Did Notice That He Was Looking At Her Boobs A Lot...Which Was Fine, Because Well She Has A Pretty Nice Pair On Her Chest, And She&#39;s Also Noticing Her Boobs Seem Much Bigger Than What She Remembers Them Being...And Why Does She Keep Having Thoughts About How Sexy Ryan Is?...This Was So Confusing But Right Now She Doesn&#39;t Care As She Laughs At Another Of His Bad Jokes And They Enjoy Each Others Company...Ryan Switches Seats So The Table No Longer Separated Them And They Could Sit Next To Each Other...After The Meal Their Were Only The Drinks Left, But They Were Taking A Long Time To Finish Them As The Conversation Was The Main Focus.<br />
<br />
But After A Particularly Flirty But Unintentional Flirt, Ryan Stares Into Jess&#39;s Eyes Which Stops Jess In Tracks And She Stops Speaking Noticing Ryan&#39;s Eyes And Stares Back Ryan Approaches Slowly Their Faces Getting Closer, Jess&#39;s Heart Beating, Pounding As He Gets Closer Jess Desperately Wanted To Tell Him To Stop, Push Him Away, Slap Him, Anything But Stand There, But She Couldn&#39;t Do Anything As They Felt Each Others Hot Breathes Cover Their Faces As Ryan Closes The Distance And Kisses Her.. Jess Closes Her Eyes And Continues The Kiss Feeling Electricity Running Through Her Body As She Enjoys The Feeling Of Their Lips Meeting Jess Couldn&#39;t Help But Love This Man, It Didn&#39;t Matter That She Was Meant To Be A Boy, He Was Perfect, And She Was Completely Hopelessly Trapped Under His Spell.<br />
<br />
She Wraps Her Arms Around His Neck As The Kiss Deepens, Feeling Completely Oblivious To Everything Else Except The Feeling Of His Tongue Entering Her Mouth, Causing Her To Moan Quietly Into The Kiss As She Moves Closer, Not Wanting To Let Go And Wishes This Moment Never Ended...<br />
<br />
Until Macy Says &quot;Alright, Alright You Two Break It Up!&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
Jess And Ryan Pull Apart With Red Faces, Realizing That Everyone Saw Their Public Display Of Affection Jess Cheeks Go Red. Embarrassed By How Much She Loved Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come On Jess We Need To Go&quot; Macy Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Okay&quot; Jess Says Blushing Before Standing Up And Walking With Macy Dragging Out The Food Court, While The Guys Followed Behind... (Billy And Ryan Still At The Food Court)<br />
<br />
Jess Was Trying To Listen To Macy But Couldn&#39;t Think About Anything But Her Kiss With Ryan, And How She Was Probably Falling In Love With Him...She Wanted To Ask Macy For Advice But Was Too Embarrassed To Admit She Had Fallen In Love With A Guy...So She Just Kept Getting Dragged Away.<br />
<br />
Ryan Then Turns To Billy And Says &quot;Hey Dude, What&#39;s The Big Deal? Why Couldn&#39;t You Hold Down Macy? A Little Longer And Jess Would&#39;ve Been Putty In My Hands&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy Says &quot;I&#39;m Trying Man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan Says &quot;Try Harder! I&#39;ve Already Had Both Girls Deeply In Love With Me! And Both Time Stopped Because Of Your Blunders!&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy Says &quot;It&#39;s Not Like I Haven&#39;t Tried, It&#39;s No Fair The Girls Were Completely Mesmerized By Your Charm! I Did Everything Right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan Says &quot;You Act Like I&#39;m Some Love Guru, I&#39;m Just Better At Picking Up Chicks, Hell I Bet I Could Get You To Swoon Over Me Too!&quot;</p>
