<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>WOW! This thread really heated up over the last day or so, starting with &quot;First Shots of a War&quot; found here: <a href="/interactives/chapter_114437.html">#114437</a><br/>
Hopefully I&#39;ll get back to some of the other Moon Lake stories either later today or tomorrow for sure. Meanwhile...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Harold Jenkins came down the stairs in his new weretiger fursona, his tail swishing proudly behind him, he couldn't help overhearing the conversation going on about recent events.<br />
"Now, Decrux threw the first punch, correct?" asked Chief O'Hara.<br />
"Yes. I had already put myself between her and Harold because he had already stated quite clearly that no matter when or if he ever decide to join were society, it would not be as a were-raccoon," answered Virginia McCoy. Although she was still wearing a bathrobe from her house next door, everyone present was still in their human forms.<br />
"Did she make any threatening moves towards Mister Jenkins?" asked the Chief.<br />
"I thought she was about to, because she kept going on about how allegedly Dean Myers and I had formed a conspiracy to keep her away from Harold. Instead I wound up getting punched in the nose," answered Virginia.<br />
"And did you?" asked Chief O'Hara.<br />
"Did I what?" wondered Virginia in return.<br />
"Form a conspiracy with Dean Myers to keep Alice Decrux away from Harold Jenkins?" clarified the chief.<br />
"No. From what I've been able to figure out, Harold and Myers talked about Decrux over lunch today, but I was not a party to that conversation, nor did I have any prior knowledge of it," answered Virginia.<br />
<br />
"How well do you know Alice Decrux?" asked Tachibana no Akane.<br />
"She's lived across the street from me for over a decade now," began Virginia, "but I rarely see or interact with her. The most interaction I've had with her in months started when we both wound up coming here to Harold's to welcome him and his daughter Melissa to Moon Lake at practically the same time."<br />
"I see, and have either of you discussed Mister Jenkins in any context since that first day?" inquired Akane.<br />
"No. Somehow she always seemed to show up just as I was either arriving or leaving here, but there was never anything like <i>I saw him first,</i> or a formal discussion of how either of us feel about Harold until she told me in no uncertain terms earlier <i>Back off bitch! He's mine!</i>" explained Virginia.<br />
"And just how do you feel about Mister Jenkins, Miss McCoy?" asked Akane.<br />
Virginia didn't hesitate to answer, "I like him. He's charming, witty, and smart, as well as being a history teacher like I am, although on the college level. I had originally came over here today to retrieve two possible text books that the school district is considering for next year that I asked Harold to review and give me his opinions on when Alice came storming over from across the street and started everything."<br />
"And what were your long range intentions towards Mister Jenkins?" Akane wanted to know.<br />
Virginia McCoy actually blushed before she said, "I hoped that Harold would develop a natural interest in me and that we would at least start seeing each other socially from time to time, if not eventually go on actual dates. Whether or not things would have progressed from there would have been up to him, although I wouldn't have pushed the issue because the Jenkins family has only been in Moon Lake less than a week now. He's still a bit overwhelmed about weres existing, despite his daughter considering becoming the family were and his sudden entry into our society. Besides, there is... or was, if I understood his delirium earlier, his concern over betraying the memories of his late wife Eliza that he expressed before allowing me to complete his first transformation."<br />
"I see," was all Tachibana no Akane said, before stepping back to confer with the others.<br />
<br />
"I must admit, when I was first informed of a disturbance at the Jenkins household, I was worried that maybe Dieter Wilhelm had a THIRD henchman in Moon Lake*, until I saw the address was here," began Town Chancellor Samantha Twist. "I've already been here to introduce myself and inform them of the Mandatory Were Law, but this is the first I've heard about his daughter going to be the family were."<br />
"She is over at my house right now with my granddaughter Megumi, after having asked me questions about the Skulk's life/soulmate bond with another," revealed Tachibana. "But our focus at the moment is what to do in <i>this</i> situation."<br />
"Even though there were no major delays in completing his first transformation like with Jenny Harper*, Harold still needs to be medically examined since he wasn't planning to join were society today," pointed out Samantha.<br />
"And give a statement," added Chief O'Hara. "So far everything McCoy said has concurred with Dean Myers' statement, although Decrux is obviously singing a different tune. Yet Decrux has a bad record with us of transforming men and then hitting them up for child support afterward, but we've haven't been able to prove anything illegal in her actions, despite there being multiple occurrences and having her up on Statute 1A accusations before."<br />
"I see," replied Akane, thinking things over. Then she said, "My suggestion would be to arrest the two women for disturbing the peace, breaking the public daylight display law, and whatever else is applicable at the moment."<br />
"I would prefer to refer any potential Statute 1A violation charges to the District Attorney's office," added Samantha.<br />
"Agreed, but whatever the DA says, you can bet we'll use this incident to reopen our investigation into Alice Decrux again," added Chief O'Hara.<br />
<br />
<b>OPTIONS TO CONTINUE THIS STORY ARE BELOW.</b><br />
<br />
<i>AND NOW FOR SOME BONUS MATERIAL!</i><br />
<i>I had originally written the following under the title "Actions Have Consequences", but discovered "Harold's First Moments Post Transformation" was already here. So while "So What Do We Do?" is all NEW material, thought you folks might like to see what I first had planned.—tmw.</i><br />
<br />
After they had sex to complete Harold Jenkins' induction into were society, he and Virginia McCoy coupled a few more times, but these were far more romantic than their initial dance together.<br />
For an encore, Harold remained on top, feeling the power and thrills of being a weretiger coursing through his new body as he finally expressed his repressed feelings towards Virginia.<br />
He did have a growing interest in her since the high school history teacher and next door neighbor first introduced herself, but thoughts and memories of his dearly departed wife Eliza kept Harold from exploring any possibility of a relationship with Virginia before that fateful moment he was scratched during her fight with would be suitor and man user Alice Decrux.<br />
<i>At least I'm not a were-raccoon,</i> Harold thought happily as they cuddled together afterward.<br />
<br />
Then Virginia expressed her growing interest in Harold by assuming the dominant position as they made love once more.<br />
Harold couldn't help noticing the smile on her feline muzzle as the weretigress happily rode him to ecstasy, and wondered how he looked furry now.<br />
Finally, as if by mutual consent, they coupled again laying on their sides facing each other. Equal partners in the proceedings, just as each hoped they would be from now on, but that was a subject that had yet to be discussed.<br />
Now the two weres laid side by side in Harold's bed, holding and caressing each other lovingly.<br />
Not a word was spoken. None were needed.<br />
They could see the feelings each had for the other in their partner's eyes.<br />
However, there was one thing Harold really wanted to do, yet wondered if it was too soon, let alone if he had the right to do it at all; while Virginia kept hoping Harold would take her from behind and truly claim her as his like a weretiger should declare his mate.<br />
<br />
Then came the knock on the bedroom door as reality shattered their romantic tranquility.<br />
"Mister Jenkins? Miss McCoy? It's Officer Sharp. If the two of you are finished now, I'm afraid I need to arrest Miss McCoy."<br />
"WHAT?" roared Harold, raising his head to face the closed door.<br />
"It's okay Harold," said Virginia, raising a paw to calm him down with a gentle stroking of his new fur. "Actions have consequences and now it's time for me to face mine."<br />
"How bad is it?" wondered Harold, looking at Virginia with great concern.<br />
"Moon Lake's laws might seem strict, but they're applied equally to weres and normal humans alike," explained Virginia. "At the very least, I'm guilty of revealing my fursona in public during the day, let alone the fight itself. I can claim self defense to an extent, especially since Alice threw the first punch. But I'll probably be facing at least the night in jail and a hefty fine for the former."<br />
"Well," began Harold, while holding her closer, "that doesn't seem too bad. But I noticed that, except for a little dried blood, your nose looks much better now."<br />
"Yes. Us weres heal fast, and there's still a lot I have to explain to you about were society because since I'm the one who turned you, technically I'm responsible for you too," revealed Virginia. "Which is why I might also be facing charges for violating Statute 1A."<br />
"What's that?"<br />
<br />
"After murder itself, which is Statute 1, the second worse possible crime in Moon Lake is turning a normal human being into a were against their will," began Virginia, in a tender voice. "It's different than the Mandatory Were Law in that the victim, in this case you, didn't have a say in the matter."<br />
"Well," began Harold, "I honestly don't know when or if I ever would have joined were society, but I'm glad I'm a member now. Especially if it means I get to spend more time with you."<br />
"That's really sweet," said Virginia with a smile, before she kissed him. "But like I said, we take our laws seriously around here. It will be up to the District Attorney's office to review the case and decide whether or not I should be charged, but if I am and am found guilty at trial, then I'll be facing a minimum jail sentence of 50 years."<br />
"WHAT?" roared Harold again. "I have no intention of pressing any charges. At least, not against you dear," he told her.<br />
That last word meant the world to Virginia, but "That doesn't change the fact that you are a were now, and that you had no immediate intention of joining were society. The only opinion on the subject you ever expressed before the fight started was that you had no intention of ever being a were-raccoon. While it might have been an accident and I have no clear memory of the exact moment, it's obvious that I did scratch you," she added, indicating the handsome weretiger lying with her in bed, "so I'll just have to wait and see what the District Attorney says."<br />
<br />
"But I... That is... you, me, us—" began Harold, trying to find the right words as Virginia reluctantly broke away from him and stood up.<br />
Harold watched as she resumed her human form and bent down to retrieve her robe from where it fell earlier.<br />
He couldn't help noticing that Virginia McCoy was as beautiful in her human form as she was furry.<br />
"It's okay Harold," said Virginia, while tying her robe's sash. "Come what may, I'm glad you're my friend and I would dearly love to get to know you better as time and fate permits. But right now I have a responsibility to face whatever guilt I have in this situation. I'm just sorry you didn't enter were society under much better circumstances than this," she added, a tear beginning to leak out of her eye as she reached for the door handle.<br />
"V-Virginia McCoy," began Harold Jenkins, standing up to face her in his feline form, as nervous as a school boy around his first crush. "I... I love you."<br />
<br />
"Oh Harold!" she exclaimed, running back to hug him. "It may be a tad too soon for the L word, but I have strong feelings for you too. Later?" she asked, before kissing him again.<br />
It felt kind of odd, but wonderful, for human female lips to be in contact with his new tiger muzzle, but for once Harold didn't stop to question the moment as he passionately returned her kiss.<br />
Then, Virginia broke away from him and kissed the tip of Harold's nose as she ran her fingers through his fur once more.<br />
After that, she brushed the tears away with one robe sleeve as she turned and opened the bedroom door.<br />
"Officer. I live next door. Would it be okay if I went home right quick and got dressed?" Harold heard her ask the cop.<br />
"I'll have to send a matron with you, but otherwise I have no problem with that ma'am," replied the officer.<br />
"Thank you," Harold heard Virginia say as he heard their footsteps start to fade.<br />
<br />
Then the new weretiger of Moon Lake sat on the edge of his bed and began to cry.<br />
That was how another officer found him moments later.<br />
"Sir?" the police officer began. "We have to take you to the hospital to make sure you're all right and get your statement on today's events."<br />
"I understand," Harold replied, looking up at him with bleary eyes. "But I have two questions for you first."<br />
"Sure. What are they?" wondered the cop.<br />
"First, how do I make sure Virginia will be all right, because she's as much an innocent victim in this mess as I am. And secondly, how exactly do I change back to my human body?" asked Harold, not knowing yet all the ins and outs of being a were.<br />
