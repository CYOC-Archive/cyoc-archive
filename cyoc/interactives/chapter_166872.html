<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were a whole lot of things running through the newly-minted amazon&#39;s mind as she looked down at Elizabeth, most of them quite dirty. With her physical changes, however, there seemed to have come a resilience to panic - or at least, that was her best explanation as to why she didn&#39;t drag Elizabeth down to the ground right then and there, instead stammering out a question. &quot;C-could uh... could you... show me around this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a wide smile she nodded, shifting her hands away from Cassandra&#39;s chest in a way that brougt her both relief and disappointment all at once. Her delicate grip was instead on one of the redhead&#39;s muscular arms, gingerly tugging her in the direction of the nearby building. &quot;I assume you&#39;ve seen parts of the island on your way here. It&#39;s quite idyllic, is it not?&quot; She giggled. &quot;I&#39;ve never met anyone who shipwrecked here and didn&#39;t consider it a paradise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well uh... yeah... got a bit of that... vibe,&quot; she agreed, hastily grabbing the sword and sheathing it before they moved closer. So she wasn&#39;t the first one who shipwrecked here. There hadn&#39;t been any other wrecks on the beach near where she crashed, but this seemed like a big island. Could&#39;ve been more wrecks elsehwere, or just at the bottom of the deep, where she couldn&#39;t hope to find it. &quot;The sword voice thing... it ah... it mentioned a fountain?&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed to put another spring in Elizabeth&#39;s step. &quot;Of course! It is, after all, why you were chosen.&quot; She led her tall companion up the steps, moving at a slow enough pace that Cassandra could take in all the decorations adorning the vast interior. Past the steps and columns, the pristine white marble played host to vibrantly colorful murals along the walls, depicting all manner of fantastical and mythological scenes. Bronze torch-stands held fires that illuminated the luxurious carpets, and the countless treasures of gold and silver and gems that lined said carpet.<br />
<br />
Though by now she could guess that the greatest treasure was at the other end of the carpet, where a traditional Greek temple might have held some grand statue of a god. Instead, the redhead found herself being led to a fountain, just as the sword had described. Intricately detailed stonework held a pool of crystal-clear water, supplied by a jet of the same liquid that spilled from atop the fountain. Elizabeth quickly sat down at the pool&#39;s edge, helping Cassandra to do the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;The spring that feeds this fountain was blessed at the moment of creation,&quot; the blonde began explaining, her tone practically reverent as she slowly moved a hand through the water. Cassandra could have sworn that her hand was actually glowing just from contact with it. &quot;A fragment of cosmic power, the same that brought life into being, permeates these waters. With a single drink, that power can stave off death forever. It&#39;s the power that forged your new body...&quot; Her eyes dropped slightly. &quot;And in the wrong hands...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassandra huffed. &quot;Yeah, I get the idea.&quot; She hesitantly dipped a hand inside the water, finding it extremely cool and pleasant to the touch. Tingly, even, though she didn&#39;t linger there long enough to get much more of an assessment. &quot;So let me guess, whichever sucker picks up the sword gets put in charge of keeping it safe, until...&quot; She trailed off, remembering the skeleton outside. &quot;They go kaput.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde raised an eyebrow. &quot;Ka... put?&quot; She seemed not to understand the word, but moved on quickly. &quot;I can assure you, to pick up the blade is no random occurrence. Many are guided here by providence, but the sword itself selects who will wield it, and only from those who are pure-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god please don&#39;t say &#39;pure of heart&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-pure in their humanity, and unaltered by other magics.&quot; There was just a hint of smugness that crept into her smile. &quot;My lady, you can rest assured that no mortal being is entirely pure of heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
She let out a sigh of relief. &quot;Oh thank Christ.&quot; Another cliche and she might&#39;ve been running that sword through her own gut. &quot;So... what do you mean by &#39;unaltered&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those who have not been changed by some mystical force.&quot; She gestured around. &quot;Such people are quite rare in this island. Those who spend any prolonged period here... they are... changed, by the magic that flows throughout this place. Only a new arrival, such as yourself, has a chance of remaining untouched by such forces.&quot;<br />
<br />
Should it have surprised her that other people here might have undergone some sort of freaky transformations? Probably not. &quot;Er... changed how, exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;It varies, from person to person. Some might only see small alterations, becoming shorter, taller, fatter, leaner. Some might see their form become something else entirely, something devoid of humanity... and still others are halfway between man and beast - sirens, centaurs, harpies, and the like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monsters and mythological beasts. Terrific. Probably the sort of thing she&#39;d be protecting this fountain from pretty soon. &quot;And what about you? You uh... you don&#39;t look like... a centaur, or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth&#39;s cheeks reddened ever so slightly as she leaned closer, her hands once again reaching up to Cassandra. One played with the long red locks of her hair, as the other drifted closer to a more sensitive area. &quot;Oh... I was one of the lucky ones, you might say. Before I came here, you see, I had developed certain... talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without warning, she squeezed a soft handful of Cassandra&#39;s chest, producing a shocked whimper from the towering woman. &quot;Before all of this, you see, I had served my kingdom against a great evil, by mastering certain ways of providing... pleasure.&quot; She raised herself up to stare into Cassadra&#39;s eyes, and within those pale green orbs, she could have sworn she saw a fire erupt. &quot;The magic of this island... it&#39;s greatly enhanced those talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
The redhead offered no resistance to being pushed off the fountain&#39;s edge and onto her back, Elizabeth following right after her. A hand trailed along the straps holding on her breastplate, and with a soft sound of leather being cut, she suddenly found the pressure released. The woman above her pulled away the bronze, tossing it aside with hands whose nails had grown black and pointed. Those same clawed hands reached up to her hair, brushing it aside so that a pair of blackened, curling horns could finish emerging from atop her head.<br />
<br />
Her touch seemed as gentle as ever as her hands turned to kneading at the massive endowments that were now exposed on Cassandra&#39;s chest - and the crimson spade tail that now wrapped around her leg seemed just as gentle. There was a new pressure on her bosom, forcing out a moan, as Elizabeth pushed herself up, stretching her back so that a pair of black-feathered wings could fully emerge, tearing away her robe with them to reveal the succubus&#39; nude form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do hope, my lady, that you&#39;ll permit me to demonstrate?&quot; She asked as she leaned in, lips hovering mere inches from Cassandra&#39;s. &quot;It has been so very, very long since I had a champion to serve.&quot;</p>
