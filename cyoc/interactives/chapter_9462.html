<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had finished all his homework and was looking for a place to go when he overheard Peter and Dustin talking about heading to the pool hall. There was a pizza place next door to the pool place, and the group had decided to spend their Sunday evening eating pizza and then hanging out at the pool hall afterwards. So Dustin decided to drive on over there with Rob, while Ty and Peter used their powers to teleport themselves, along with Ryan, to the pool hall. When they arrived there, they were greeted by Max and Brian.<br />
<br />
“So, you buys think you can come in here to play some pool, huh?” Max growled at the crew. Max was a big, tall, heavy set man who hated it when high school kids walked in the hall.<br />
<br />
“Hey, there’s nothing wrong with us coming here to play pool. As long as we pay for our table, we have every right to play pool here!” Peter answered, while feeling annoyed by Max’s comments. <br />
<br />
Dustin and Rob were about to start a new match, while Ty went to pay for a table so he could play a match with his cousin. But Max clearly didn’t like the idea of high school kids walking around the pool hall, and was determined to toss them out of the hall.<br />
<br />
Max and Brian happened to be there, although they weren’t exactly friends. Max was playing with Bo, when the guys walked in. Brian was one of Ty’s classmates from school, and he was very happy that Ty and Peter had decided to show up, since he began to feel lonely being the only teen there.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty had just gathered their cue sticks and began to place the balls in the rack on the table, when Max walked up to them.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want you guys taking the table next to us! Use some other table!” he yelled at Ty.<br />
<br />
“But I just paid for this table! We have every right to play here, so leave us alone!” Ty responded, clearly getting annoyed.<br />
<br />
“Look, Max, Ty just paid for this table and we are going to play here. So leave us alone, alright?” Peter said calmly, realizing that Max was looking for trouble.<br />
<br />
Max stepped forward, and placed his hands on Peter’s chest, shoving him with his back against the table.<br />
<br />
Rob and Ty immediately grabbed hold of Peter, who obviously hurt his back against the edge of the table which was behind him. He began to grind his teeth, clearly showing that he was in pain, when he opened his eyes and looked back at Max with anger.<br />
<br />
“Boy, I’m gonna turn you into a lizard…” Peter said, while he was furious.<br />
<br />
“Peter, stop! Don’t do anything!” Rob said, “Just stay calm”. Rob then thought of a plan for teaching Max a lesson. Knowing that Peter and Ty had the ability to hear his thoughts, he thought of the following. “Don’t use your magical powers in here, for you’ll cause a panic. Fight him at his own game, and just beat him at pool!”<br />
<br />
Peter smiled for a minute, as he watched Max walk back to his table. Ty realized what Peter had in mind, as Peter made a silent wish for Max not to be able to hit the eight-ball in any pocket. Ty grinned, as he looked over, when he noticed the results of Max’s handicap.<br />
<br />
Max was still finishing up his match with Bo, and only had the eight-ball left to clear off the table. Every time he tried to line up his cue stick and aimed for the eight-ball, his shot would be off by just a bit and the eight-ball would bounce off the edge. This gave Bo the opportunity to clear all his solids off the table, ending the game when he knocked the eight-ball in the corner pocket. Max was very disappointed, but felt like Bo was just lucky and beat him.<br />
<br />
“Okay Max, let’s play. Just you and me!” Peter said out loud. Ty decided to play against Bo, while Peter played against Max. Rob and Dustin had a table of their own, while Brian walked around the hall, feeling bored. Ty picked up on that, and called out to his buddy.<br />
<br />
“Hey Brian, don’t go too far! I’m playing you next!” Ty shouted at him.<br />
<br />
“I want to walk around a little bit, but there’s nothing else to do here! This place is too small…” Brian complained, while looking at Ty. <br />
<br />
“I can fix that!” Ty said, with a smile. Suddenly, Brian felt himself shrinking down, as his clothing shrunk with him so he would not be naked. The 6-foot teenager slowly shrunk down to 5 feet, 4 feet, 3 feet. He gasped at first, but then smiled, as it was always a fantasy of his to see the world as a tiny human being. Ty decided to shrink Brian down to 6 inches tall, until they would get ready to play the next pool game.<br />
<br />
“So, you think you can beat me, huh? Don’t be a sore loser when this is over, Peter!” Max sneered, as he placed the balls on the rack. Peter just wiped his tip of his cue stick with some chalk, as he watched Max place the balls on the table.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I won’t!” Peter responded confidently, already knowing that he was going to win the match.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to be humiliated in front of all your friends!” Max growled back, not knowing he was playing with a teenage wizard.<br />
<br />
“No, I won’t be humiliated!” Peter responded quickly. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, Brian found himself in this giant room! He walked around, looking up at the giant pool tables, which now looked like huge buildings towering over him. He became thirsty from walking, what seemed like miles and miles of hardwood floor, when it was just a few feet to the bar, overlooking the pool hall. Once he got there, he began to climb up one of the bar stools, that was towering over him.<br />
<br />
“I will have the pleasure of breaking, since I know I’m going to beat you!” Max said in a boastful manner, as Peter calmly looked on, holding his cue stick in hand, and giving him a serious look on his face.<br />
<br />
One of the solids rolled in the pocket, as Max waited for the balls to stop rolling following the break. Max then knocked two other solid balls off the table, giving peter a look of confidence and an assured victory.<br />
<br />
Peter knocked two balls off the table and scratched on his third, allowing Max to place the ball for his next hit. Max rolled three more balls off the table, until he missed his shot on the fourth one. Peter missed his shot, and Max easily cleared all the balls off the table, except for the eight-ball.<br />
<br />
Brian finally made it to the bar stool, when he climbed on to the counter top. The bartender was just busy wiping the wooden surface, when Brian decided to place his order.<br />
<br />
“Bartender! Excuse me!” Brian shouted out loud. But since he was only six inches tall, the bartender could barely hear him. When he finally heard Brian’s squeaky voice, he looked around the bar, but he didn’t see anyone.<br />
<br />
“Over here, mister bartender!!” Brian shouted, waving his hands over his head. The bartender looked over, until he noticed the tiny human being standing on his counter.<br />
<br />
“AAAAAARHHGGHHGG” the bartender yelled, as soon as he saw the tiny high school student. He had never seen anyone that small before, and he was shocked beyond belief when he saw Brian. “I need a drink… fast!” the poor man yelled, as he poured a glass of soda for himself.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, I had better ask Ty to make me grow back!” Brian thought to himself, as he jumped back on to the bar stool from the counter top and decided to climb back down on to the wooden floor in the pool hall, while Ty and Bo were finishing up their game.<br />
<br />
Max was clearly getting frustrated. He only had the eight-ball left to knock into the pocket, but he somehow could not get the ball to roll into the pocket. In the meantime, Peter continued to roll all his balls into the pocket, and it finally came down to the eight-ball being the only ball left on the table. Peter tried to sink the ball but missed, leaving the game in Max’s hands.<br />
<br />
Max’s bragging clearly had died down when he realized that Peter had an opportunity to beat him, so he tried his hardest to hit the eight-ball on his turn so that he could finish the game and declare himself as the winner. But it didn’t happen, he missed his shot again, and Peter ended up sinking the ball on his last turn.<br />
<br />
“Darn! I can’t believe I lost that game! You were lucky!” Max sneered at Peter, who just stared at him with a smile on his face. He taught Max a lesson, but he wasn’t done with him yet. He wanted to make sure that Max wasn’t going to bully anyone for a long time to come.<br />
<br />
Max threw his cue stick on the table and turned around, as he began to walk towards the door, but Peter stopped him.<br />
<br />
“Not so fast, Max! You think you can bully us around, like a big, overgrown gorilla? Well, then you’ll be one too!” Peter shouted back at him. Suddenly Max froze before the door. He looked down, as he felt his skin itching all over. His arms, legs, and chest were all covered with long, black fur! He began to bend down as his spine was reformed, and he was suddenly standing with his legs spread further apart than normal. His hands and fingers became thicker, as he watched his hands changed color in horror. <br />
<br />
“What is this? What are you doing to me?” he said, as he felt his body changing into that of a large, silverback gorilla! Peter and Ty just stood there and smiled, as Dustin, Bo, and Rob gasped in horror as the large, muscular man found himself slowly being transformed into a full size gorilla!<br />
<br />
“OH NO! STOP IT! I’M TURNING INTO A… A… OOH OOH OOH!!!” he said, as he lost the ability to form words and now was left with just making grunts and snort sounds.<br />
<br />
Rob grabbed Peter’s arm as he pulled the teen towards him. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing? The people in here are going to cause a major panic!” Rob warned Peter cautiously.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry. He’ll change back as soon as he’s out the door!” Peter grinned. <br />
<br />
Max’s human face began to shift, as his mouth was pushed out further and the eyebrows became thick and deep. Max had a silver colored line of fur on his back while the rest of him was covered with black fur. He then stumbled out the door and walked out on to the parking lot, where he slowly began to change back. In the meantime, Brian had observed the incredible transformation while standing in front of one of the tables. He was completely in awe, and began to cry out to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Ty! Ty, don’t forget about me! TYLER!” he screamed, but Ty couldn’t hear him. Brian ran over to where Ty was standing, and climbed up his tennis shoe. Ty and Peter were just looking on as Rob and Dustin were playing their game.<br />
<br />
“Boy, you really taught Max a lesson alright!” Ty said to his cousin, who was standing next to him.<br />
<br />
“Well, I really didn’t play that great, but I felt like I had to do something. I couldn’t stand the way he was yelling at us in the beginning!” Peter responded, explaining his actions to his cousin. Then Peter looked over and noticed tiny Brian crawling up Ty’s t-shirt.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ty, don’t forget about Brian who is crawling up your sleeve right now!” Peter responded, pointing to Ty’s shirt.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry Brian. I’d better grow you back!” Ty replied, as he looked down at the small man who was climbing up his shirt’s sleeve.<br />
<br />
“No! I want to be a small gorilla, just like how you changed Max! I want to know what that feels like!” Brian shouted back. Ty grabbed the 6-inch student by his shirt and gently lowered him on the surface of the pool table. He then made his clothes disappear, and immediately Brian felt his body becoming completely covered with a thick, layer of fur.<br />
<br />
Ty and Peter looked on as Brian quickly grew into a young, 4-foot gorilla! His face had changed, and he began to lean forward as his arms, legs, feet and hands began to grow bigger, heavier, and were now covered with a layer of hair.<br />
<br />
“Alright you guys, we’re heading home! We’ve had enough excitement for one evening!” Dustin said. Dustin and Ray left and took the car home, as Peter and Ty were left behind with Ryan and Brian, who was now transformed into a young gorilla. <br />
<br />
“What are you going to do about Brian?” Peter had asked Ty.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I guess I’ll change him back when he lets me know he’s ready!” Ty responded, as Ty and Peter walked on out to the parking lot while they were being followed by a young, baby gorilla.</p>
