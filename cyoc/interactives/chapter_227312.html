<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew hadn&#39;t thought about going back to slave times, but after several months of living comfortably in a world with no rap music, Black Lives Matter riots or annoying commie libtards, he was beginning to warm up to the idea. <br />
<br />
Still, he found himself wanting to experiment more. True, he worked hard and his family spent a lot of time gathering food for the winter or making quilts and such, but he thought about it and after a while conceived of a new experiment. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am now one of the handsomest men in the world. I am famous in America because my good looks, charm and intelligence propelled me into politics. I am also a bodybuilder but I don&#39;t have to work out. I am over 450 pounds with only 10% body fat, no matter what I eat. I have superior genetics. I am over 7 feet tall and most normal sized men find me incredibly intimidating to be around and happily agree to do anything I ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a white flash. <br />
<br />
Soon, the house he lived in had changed to a large mansion near the outskirts of a small town, There was still farmland as well as a private lake for his 8 children to play in and explore. His libido, in combination with the era, had resulted in him having far more children, and he was proud of how many he had sired. His wife, bless her soul, had produced 8 healthy boys and girls. <br />
<br />
He towered above her now. At 7&#39;8&quot;, he was a literal giant. A Goliath among men. When he spoke, his booming voice echoed throughout the house. He face was a combination of some of the best and most rugged looking men of all time. His muscles were like that of a titan, a god. He walked among mere mortals and they looked up at him as if he was a Greek god. He was an ex army general and had gone into politics and easily won the race for governor of his state. Men jumped to do what he told them to do. When he spoke, everyone listened to him. <br />
<br />
It was an incredible thing to be one of the largest, most impressive looking men on Earth. His physique was so perfect that he found himself overwhelmingly turned on as he looked at his reflection, pumping his 90 inch chest and his 37 inch arms in the vast mirror of his enormous bathroom, which spanned the marble floors and gold gilded faucets. His bathroom was the size of his former house! His cock was proportioned and sprang out a full 12 inches, a fuckrod of such superior make that his wife often complained about its size and girth in the early days before she got used to being fucked so hard and so often by his giant dick. <br />
<br />
Most fully grown men, the tops of their heads came up to his belt. Perfect for sucking his enormous shaft, he thought ruefully. <br />
<br />
Wait...why did I just think that? <br />
<br />
And then he remembered. Giants were an actual race here. True, he was one of the tallest men of giant heritage but there were giant white men scattered all over the world. Roughly 5% of the human population was made up of giants and giantesses, which explained the few 6&#39;4&quot; women he had seen with parasols fanning themselves on the street, pining over him and hoping their parents would be able to find them a giant suitor so they could marry soon. <br />
<br />
His wife was six feet and two inches tall herself, short for a giantess but at least he didn&#39;t totally dwarf her the same way he did these pathetic little runt humans, he thought gratefully. <br />
<br />
Most giant men didn&#39;t surpass 7 foot 2, but he was in the top tiers of giants himself. Being seven feet and eight inches tall gave him a complete superiority complex. Most giants were seen as superior to normal men and they quickly found themselves becoming leaders at an early age. A five year old giant boy was going to be five feet tall, and by the time a giant boy was seven years old, he was usually five feet and five inches tall. By the age of 8 or 9, most giant children were six feet tall and could easily shove around most fully grown men around like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
Still, society dictated a polite decorum and giants were under heavy scrutiny to follow the protocol. However, it wasn&#39;t uncommon at all to see seven foot tall police officers, army men, and positions of leadership in business were common as well. The world looked up to giants...and the pheromonal affect they had on regular humans ensured their survival as the dominant race. Whereas the previous universes he had lived in would think of him as a rarity, he was now part of a dominant giant class above the rest of humanity, ruling as the gentle giant rulers often did. <br />
<br />
However, that was not to say that giants couldn&#39;t be strict with their human counterparts. <br />
<br />
One of Andrews new giant sons, Henry, was a six foot tall nine year old dressed up for church one day when a man picked a fight with him over an accusation that he had spooked the man&#39;s horse on purpose. Henry had put up with the insults until the man mentioned his giant mother and then he promptly knocked the man out, being much bigger and stronger than the adult he was dealing with. The authorities had handled it well, admonishing the man for mouthing off to a young giant, who was clearly in the right. The police almost always sided with giants, and there was a silent &quot;giant privilege&quot; that was unspoken of in American society. Giant boys could technically push around whoever they wanted, granted that they didn&#39;t make too much a spectacle of it. <br />
<br />
Giving speeches to the townsfolk was one of Andrew&#39;s newest greatest pleasures. His large booming voice made pronouncements about building efforts to restore the library and build an addition to the orphanage, fund the hospital with new staff and make sure that the drinking water was being filtered properly. Sanitation had been very lax when he first arrived to this universe so he fixed that with the book and now everyone had modern plumbing and sewage systems. <br />
<br />
Slaves were especially respectful of him, and Andrew noticed that there were none of the problems that came with allowing blacks into political positions of power. There was very little corruption in a world dominated by white giants. Who would dare to make a white giant angry? <br />
<br />
He was happy with his new life and saw no reason to change it. He was a giant among men and his strength and muscles were unrivaled in his area. He liked to show it off every now and then by taking his shirt off on special festival days, and played tug of war by himself with 6 men on the other end. All the townspeople cheered as Andrew won by a margin, though he congratulated his much smaller counterparts for giving him a good workout. <br />
<br />
All of the men were entranced by him after being defeated and overpowered. This was of course due to the fact that in this universe, giants were a sort of oversexed beast man at times, and other normal sized men who were not homosexual would become infatuated with the idea of gay sex so that they could receive the gift of giant sperm entering their bodies. Such a gift of masculine energy was known to be medicinal. In fact, many of the modern medicines had been produced from giant sperm. Giant sperm was dried and powdered and put into all kinds of things for people to heal from injuries and ailments. <br />
<br />
However, there was a revitalizing effect that happened in regular sized men when they were able to ingest the sperm or even the sweat of their giant counterparts. They became energized, moreso for fresh cum than powdered and it was considered an honor for a giant man to bathe his smaller human counterparts with the gift of giant semen straight from his dick. <br />
<br />
That day, all the men from the tug of war challenge begged for Andrew to meet them at the local bathhouse, and he obliged. All sex men threw themselves at Andrew, who sat calmly in the hot spring as they all kissed him, groomed him, massaged him. All of the men were known to him. Some of them worked on farms he owned. Some of them were clerks in the building he governed. They ooohed and ahhhed over his giant shoulders, pecs, back, legs, abs, and arms, calling him Zeus and Hercules were common nicknames for Andrew these days. He showed them how strong he was as he picked them off the ground like children and swung them into the air for them to land in a giant splash in the pool. Andrew laughed so hard the windows in the building vibrated. <br />
<br />
When it came time for him to cum, he had over a gallon of giant sperm in his enormous basketball sized balls. He bathed them all in a torrent, hitting them across all of their six faces the way a firehose would, a firehose filled with sugary frosting. <br />
<br />
He had quite a lot left for his wife back home so he excused himself as they all thanked him for the bounty of his sperm. <br />
<br />
Andrew thought about the new universe he lived in. He wasn&#39;t expecting homosexual acts to be so fun and he wanted to explore them further. After all, what was a giant dick for, if not to provide pleasure to mere mortals?</p>
