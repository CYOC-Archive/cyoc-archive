<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Nate that girl of yours is a piece of work,” Mike sighs after dropping her off at her parent’s place.<br />
“Yes,” Nate agrees; “But the sex, that was something.”<br />
“Life isn’t all about rutting kid,” Mike getting serious; “While it’s fun to fool around with a person like that when you’re young; later you’ll want someone more grounded in common sense.”<br />
“Well Liv is Bi-sexual and living in Seattle,” Nate answers; “Not a lot of options there for a were to get some relief as it is.”<br />
“Not true,” Mike answers; “plenty of were’s living outside of Moon Lake manage to make do. I did after my wife passed on.”<br />
Nate thinks upon what Mike Lawson just said; “yes, but those options cost money for the services of a were escort. They aren’t cheap.”<br />
“How the hell do you know that?” Mike looking shocked.<br />
“My previous girlfriend was an escort agent; when she wasn’t working as a teller at Moon Lake’s bank, she was servicing various &#39;gentlemen&#39;.” Nate states referring to Kenya; a were-panther he broke up with after finding out she was still working her second job and was proposed to by one of her clients.<br />
<br />
Mike Lawson doesn’t answer; preferring not to know, he pulls into the parking lot of the local grocery store. Both Nate and Mike get out doing some shopping for the breakfast feast Maggie is prepping. They grab several dozen of eggs, packages of hickory smoked bacon, pemeal bacon, sausage links, loaves of bread and a sack of oranges. As Nate pushes the cart to the checkout, Mike drops in a couple packs of steaks and a family sized package of ready to eat hash brown mix. Mike pays for it all on his credit card and the two werewolves head back to his car.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
“Think you bought enough food,” Maggie looking at her father in law in stunned disbelief.<br />
“You’ll thank me,” Mike answers pulling the steaks out of the grocery bags; “especially after all the energy you expended last night with your humping and hollering.”<br />
&quot;Well it looks like we are having a brunch instead;” Maggie looking at all the food; “Even with Martha helping me it’s going to take forever to prepare all this.”<br />
“Evan and I will cook the steaks and sausages on the BBQ,” Mike continues; “Eric and Spencer can work the toaster and help you with the bacon by microwaving it.”<br />
“That still leaves the eggs and pemeal bacon,” Maggie sighs.<br />
“Scramble the eggs first and keep them warm in the oven then work on the pemeal,” Mike finally adds; “Nate and William can cut and prep the orange slices.”<br />
“And the hash brown mix?” Maggie looking at Mike.<br />
“That just needs to be reheated;” Mike taking the steaks and sausages to his son’s BBQ.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
With everyone pitching in; making breakfast only took an hour. The smell of bacon and eggs staying warm in the oven with pemeal frying on the stove; quickly overtook the smell of love throughout the house. Eric dressed in the clothes Nate brought over was sitting next to Spencer. Both digging into their steak and eggs with gusto; clearly those two were hungry after the intense night of passion the two had.<br />
<br />
While Martha and Maggie decided not to have the steaks, Evan and Mike cooked up; they did devour the sausages. If children were not present at the table; the two bi-sexual weres would be putting on a show of playfully nibbling the tubes of meat and slowly deep throating them. Instead they just enjoyed the company of each other’s family as small talk was made and a laugh expended from a joke or two.<br />
<br />
While Mike and Evan did try to cook the steaks evenly; some did come out rare and a few others came out medium rare. William grabbing one of the rare steaks; he used his eggs and toast to sop up the bloody juices. Evan and Nate were also doing the same with their rare steaks. Despite the amount of food prepared, everyone eventually started to slow down as they were getting full.<br />
“Looks like we got breakfast leftovers for supper,” Evan comments as he quietly belches.<br />
“We’ll help with that,” William answers.<br />
“I’ll get the Tupperware,” Maggie slowly gets up.<br />
<br />
Eric and Spencer the only two to clear their plates twice were nibbling on orange slices. Both looked like they were ready to have a nap. Evan notices the two starting to nod off speaks up.<br />
“Do you two have plans today?”<br />
Eric and Spencer wake up and both nod their heads. But Eric speaks up; “We are going to meet up with Frieda and then decide what to do afterwards.”<br />
“Fine,” Evan answers, “Just remember to be careful; If you three come back here; be mined full that the basement isn’t sound proof.”<br />
“Ours is,” William comments looking at the two amorous children; “But will Benton be dropping Frieda off or picking her back up afterwards?” William still angry that the were-panther had the gall to lay hands on Eric Anderson last night.<br />
“Frieda is getting dropped off somewhere and walking here,” Spencer answers as she and Eric get up;” but first she is to visit her mother at the hospital.”<br />
&quot;Is Frieda spending the night here or at our house?&quot; William asks.<br />
“That we don’t know dad,” Eric answering.<br />
“Alright then, get going you two. But Eric;” Martha adds; “tomorrow you and I are going clothes shopping.”<br />
<br />
Eric just nods. Since becoming a were-panther, all his clothes have become tight fitting. He is yanked by Spencer and the two head out the door. Nate is about to get up when William places a hand on his shoulder making him sit back down.<br />
“Did you think your mother and I forgot about you playing hooky?” William grins; “you got chores. Both the front and back lawn needs to be raked up with all the leaves that fell on the ground.”<br />
Nate moans but is interrupted.<br />
“You’re doing the raking son,” William showing no hint of humor; “While you are raking I have papers that need grading.”<br />
“And I have lesson plans to prepare for,” Martha states; “I just hope the elementary school is up and running on Monday.”<br />
Mike Lawson interrupts; “Before I forget; Frances Twist wanted me to let you know that she needs to talk to you about something. She didn’t say what is was about.”<br />
“Thanks Mike,” Martha answers as she and William accept the Tupperware containers full of leftover breakfast; “I’ll have Eric bring these back the next time he comes over Maggie.”<br />
“No rush,” Maggie states; “But we do need to do this again.”<br />
“Our place next time,” William grins.<br />
<br />
Evan and Maggie escort William and Martha to the door and see each leave in their own vehicles; Nate having already left minutes ago. Evan closes the door and look at his father;<br />
“Come on you crank,” Evan jokes; “I need your help in measuring the material needed to sound proof the basement.”<br />
“But first,” Maggie interrupts; “you two are helping me clean up. Dishes need doing, laundry needs washing and carpets need vacuuming.” Maggie continues, “I got the laundry; you two fight over who does the dishes and who does the vacuuming.”</p>
