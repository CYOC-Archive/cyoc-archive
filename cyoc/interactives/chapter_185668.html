<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren decided to go home and test out the tablet tomorrow after a good night’s sleep. When he arrived, his parents were bickering about something so he grabbed an apple and headed upstairs to do the rest of his weekend homework.<br />
<br />
The next morning he awoke refreshed and ready for mischief. He got ready and hopped on the bus. Being an only child, he only had to worry about getting himself ready and to the bus on time. <br />
<br />
He thought about altering some sexualities on the bus but decided to wait for what was really exciting to him. Third period gym class. Once he was done with the first two periods he quickly headed to the locker room.<br />
<br />
He didn’t want to make it obvious that he was changing his gym teacher’s sexuality so he didn’t want to scan him directly. Luckily the tablet had a function for a radius scan, with which the user gets a list of people within 100 yards, or less if you change the setting. Darren only needed 15 yards then he found his gym teacher in the scan.<br />
<br />
Darren’s gym teacher Mr. Karl was every straight girl and gay boy’s wet dream at this school. He was 6’1”, very muscular and lean, with dark black hair, brown eyes, and lots of body hair. He was the kind of guy who would shave every morning but immediately have five o’clock shadow. His glasses only served to make him more distinguished instead of giving him a nerdy look.<br />
<br />
Darren clicked on Mr. Karl’s profile, “Westly Karl, 34, married, interested in women 25+...”<br />
<br />
Changing the interested in, Darren at first made it “men 15+” but then decided on “men 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18”. Now his poor gym teacher would find himself attracted to many of his students. To make matters worse for him, Darren altered his libido up several points. Now he was way hornier than he used to be.<br />
<br />
Mr. Karl normally hung out in the main area of the locker room to chat with the boys before class and make sure no bullying was going on. He tried to do that today to some degree of success...<br />
<br />
As the other boys began to come in, Mr. Karl greeted them as usual, but couldn’t help but notice them sexually. He caught himself checking out their asses after they passed where he was sitting. He was clearly distressed but too horny to control his new urges. It only got worse as the boys started to undress. He found himself wishing they’d have to take everything off, including their underwear. He had to satisfy himself with the image of them in their underwear, for the fleeting moments until they put on their gym shorts.<br />
<br />
Unlike the other boys who were clueless about Mr. Karl’s new sexuality, Darren intentionally flaunted his body in the direction of his teacher. He took every minute he had to change, only putting his gym shorts on over his briefs in the last minute.<br />
<br />
Being the last one to leave the locker room to head to class, Darren was stopped by Mr. Karl, “Darren, start the class on a game of kickball. Tell them I have some paperwork I have to do.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing handsome,” said Darren. He could see that Mr. Karl was using his clipboard to unsuccessfully hide his huge boner. Yesterday there would’ve been no way Darren could’ve gotten away with calling his teacher handsome.<br />
<br />
As his students were all playing kickball, Mr. Karl tried desperately to figure out what was going on with himself. He thought about his wife and started trying to jerk his already erect penis in his office. To his dismay, thinking of his wife caused his boner to recede instead of exacerbating it. Just this morning he would’ve killed to have his wife sit on his face and suck his cock. Now, that thought did less than nothing for him.<br />
<br />
Westly Karl was in quite the predicament. His thoughts again went to his students. He wanted to see their dicks, to touch them, lick them, put them in his ass, and to have them do all of those things to his penis as well. These thoughts made his cock spring into an 8 in boner all over again. He took his shirt off and jerked his nice cock until it sprayed jizz all over his chest and tummy. Pretending it belonged to one of the better looking boys, he brought some of his own cum to his mouth. He savored it.<br />
<br />
Westly quickly cleaned up himself and now that he wasn’t hard, joined his class to finish up the kickball game. At the end of the game he told them that the next gym glass would start a swimming unit, and not to worry if they didn’t bring a swimsuit because he would provide for the class. Darren was the only one to realize that this would mean starting the swim unit weeks early. He was also the only one who could’ve figured out why, and he chuckled to himself.</p>
