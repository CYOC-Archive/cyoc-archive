<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake ran straight out the door and stopped. He looked left and right down the hallways. He saw nobody, but both turned off into another direction after about fifteen metres. He turned right and bolted forward. He could not let Kyle fucking Perkins simply take his cock away completely. He turned right and was instantly face to face with none other than Principal  Collins. He had no time to react, and ran straight into him, knocking him over backwards and landing on top of him.<br />
Jake knocked his head on the floor as they fell, and he lay there for a moment, stunned.<br />
 &quot;Mr. Smith, would you mind getting off me, please.&quot; Principal Collins said.<br />
Jake rolled off the principal and they both climbed to their feet.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Principal Collins.&quot; Jake said.<br />
&quot;Mr. Smith, why are you not in class?&quot;<br />
Jake hesitated. He certainly couldn&#39;t tell the truth to the Principal. &quot;Um-&quot;<br />
&quot;Well if you do not know, them let me escort you back to your class.&quot;<br />
Jake hesitated again. Then realized that there was no way around this.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; principal Collins said, &quot;where is your classroom?&quot;<br />
&quot;My first class is English, with Mr Sherling.&quot; Jake reluctantly said.<br />
&quot;This way, Mr. Smith.&quot;<br />
Jake followed Principal Collins back to his classroom and took his seat, apologizing to his teacher for taking so long. The whole time he was wondering where Kyle was and what he was doing with his dick. He could no longer feel anything except soft cloth against his penis. He was scared to think of what might happen to it while it wasn&#39;t attached, but for now he was stuck in this classroom.<br />
He waited painfully for the class to end so he could go and pound on that little bastard, Kyle. The whole time he sat in class, he could feel his cock eager to get off. His balls started to ache a little, but there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.<br />
As soon as he was permitted to leave, Jake rushed out into the halls, pushing past everyone in search of Kyle. The next bell rang and the students started thinning out in the hallways. Jake didn&#39;t see Kyle anywhere. He cursed and headed to his next class. He took his seat and tried to concentrate on the class but all he could think about was his cock. His balls ached more and more as time passed. He needed some release as soon as possible.<br />
All of a sudden, he felt a tight grip on his cock. He almost screamed out at the touch, but was able to control himself, barely. A hand was holding the base of his cock, where his balls were. Another hand was gently stroking the length of his shaft.<br />
What is that little faggot doing? Jake wondered.<br />
He propped his book up and sank his head to the desk as his face contorted into a look of lust and pleasure. The stroking was not enough to get him off, but it increased his desire tenfold, and he was trying as hard as he could to just stay quiet.<br />
The stroking of his cock stopped, and Jake breathed a sigh of relief. A mixed look of horror and ecstasy soon filled his face as he felt his cock push though a set of lips and a tongue on the underside of his cock. He gritted his teeth tightly to stop from making a sound as the person Jake hoped wasn&#39;t Kyle began sucking faster and faster. He could feel the back of their throat tighten and gag on his the head of his cock as it was thrust in and out of their mouth.<br />
In less than a minute he was shooting his load into the persons mouth, and they were taking in every drop. The aching in his balls lessened but didn&#39;t completely vanish. Then a strange feeling came over Jake. It was like some force was tugging at his crotch. He remembered the words of Kyle&#39;s curse: &quot;When you orgasm while they aren&#39;t attached, they will be drawn to your crotch like a magnet.&quot;<br />
Jake stood up, unable to ignore the pull at his crotch as it tugged him towards the door. &quot;Excuse me, Miss Randell. Can I be excused to go to the bathroom?&quot; He asked.<br />
&quot;Take the pass, and be back in less than five minutes.&quot; Miss Randell said. &quot;Don&#39;t make me come looking for you or you will be sitting here after school in detention.&quot;<br />
&quot;Five minutes.&quot; Jake said. &quot;No problem.&quot;<br />
Jake took the pass and bolted out the door, following the tug in his crotch. He ran down the hallway and turned left. Down that hallway and turned left again. He ran down that hallway, too far, and felt the tug now pulling him from behind. He stopped and turned around. He approached the door that he felt the tug coming from. It was one of the girls bathrooms.<br />
He took a deep breath and pushed the door opened, prepared to beat up Kyle. He stepped into the bathroom and looked around. There were four stalls.<br />
He unzipped his pants and lowered them to his thighs, letting his crotch lead him to the third stall. He felt the tugging grow much stronger, then he heard a soft splatting kind of noise. His cock and balls slid along the floor underneath the door and sprang up at his crotch. The impact made Jake stumble back. He was glad that his cock was now re-attached. But it was dirty from the floor and still slick with the persons saliva.<br />
He turned and did his pants up, leaving out the door. He rounded the corner and ran into...</p>
