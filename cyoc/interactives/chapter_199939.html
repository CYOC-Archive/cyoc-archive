<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was sometime after lunch, and Jen-Jen was sitting at the back of the classroom sketching out plans for a mind control device she could use to make people want to “plow her up and down the field” if you catch my drift. She was halfway through figuring out the power source when she suddenly realized something she should have hours ago. How the heck was she going to turn the cheerleaders into goblins when she didn’t have the curse? The realization suddenly got to her, making her growl with frustration and accidentally disrupting the rest of the class.<br />
<br />
“You okay, girl?” a classmate to her left asked. It was Rachel, one of the cheerleaders and another “friend” of Jen-Jen’s.<br />
<br />
“Me fine,” Jen grumbled, “Ray-Ray no needa worry about it. Gobbo affair.”<br />
<br />
“If you’re sure, Jen-Jen,” Rachel said, going back to paying half attention to Mrs. Johnson’s lecture and half attention to the cheer squad’s group text. Well that explained all of the buzzing Jen-Jen’s phone was making.<br />
<br />
Jen-Jen stowed her mind control ray plans away in her necklace of infinite storage and made a token attempt to listen to Mrs. Johnson’s presidential cabinet lecture. Mrs. Johnson was one of the more unusual bodies at East Hampton High School. Her neck was abnormally long, girthy, veiny, and throbbing, and her swollen breasts were like a pair of jiggly watermelons that were barely contained in their bra. Of course, her neck doubled as her torso and her breasts were at crotch level, and she also didn’t have any arms. She at least had floating hands. On top of that she had a meaty butt and thighs that she’d managed to stuff inside a pair of sensible enough slacks, even though her pussy constantly dribbled with juices and soaked through them. Then there’s the fact that her mouth usually drooled uncontrollably and that her drool was actually precum… at least, it smelled the same as precum… and sticky like precum. It’s no secret that she pukes semen throughout the day.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ray-Ray,” Jen-Jen whispered to Rachel, “Does you ever think about how weird it is that Mrs. Johnson am penis woman?”<br />
<br />
“Meh, I mean at first,” Rachel shrugged, “but I’ve pretty much just learned to ignore it. She said it’s a medical condition anyway, so probably best not to bug her about it. She… has a <i>hard</i> enough time dealing with it.”<br />
<br />
<i>Logically, me think Mrs. Johnson am cursed,</i> Jen-Jen thought to herself. She supposed she could figure that out later, because now she had to figure out how to get the curse back so she could convert the cheerleaders. She quickly pulled out her phone and started texting Kyl-Kyl.<br />
<br />
Jen: Me need curse. You still have it?<br />
<br />
Kyl: No. Me pass it on. Now it belong to Gar-Gar, Jam-Jam, Ger-Ger, and Meg-Meg. Them gobbo now.<br />
<br />
Jen: Ooh good! Me know Jam-Jam’s brother Bru-Bru. Him on wrestling team. Me remember once had sex with him back when me was stupid humie. Me call Jam-Jam and have him curse me and then me get to work on cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
The goblin girl then put her phone away in her necklace and hopped out of her desk, walking into the hallway. Even though the goblins could do as they pleased, it still payed to respect <i>some</i> human manners. Besides, as much as the idea excited her, it probably wasn’t a good idea to tick off Mrs. Johnson and have her puke semen all over her. So she went into the halls, dialed Jam-Jam’s number, and waited for him to pick up. It went to answering machine the first time but instead of leaving a message she just hung up and redialed. The second time was the charm.<br />
<br />
“Jen-Jen! What’s da haps?” Jam-Jam greeted over the phone, “Can you make it quick? Me plowing Meg-Meg right now.”<br />
<br />
“Me make it quick if <i>you</i> make it quick, Jam-Jam,” Jen-Jen answered, “Also, where am you? Me wanna some that action! No, hold on, business first. Give Jen-Jen curse real quick.”<br />
<br />
“Oh-be kay-be,” Jam-Jam replied, “Transform or Dare?”<br />
<br />
“Dare!”<br />
<br />
“Uhh… okay, me dare you come have fun with Jam-Jam and Meg-Meg on soccer field.” Jam-Jam commanded.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, sucker,” Jen-Jen smirked, hanging up and sprinting towards the soccer field.<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
By the time she was done canoodling with the other two newly minted goblins, Jen-Jen was covered head to toe in caked on cum, grime, and grass clippings. She plodded into the girl’s locker room for a shower before she went to meet with the cheer squad for not just practice, but to pick up the homework she’d done for them so that they could copy it in their own handwriting. <i>Me no need for doing that once cheerleaders is gobbos,</i> the goblin girl thought coyly to herself. The rest of the cheerleaders shuffled into the locker room to change. There were Kimberly and Rachel, but also Tanesha, Samantha, Riley, and Susan.<br />
<br />
“So <i>there’s</i> our little green secret weapon,” Riley grinned when she saw the goblin girl toweling off, “Let me guess, just got back from an orgy?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, just three-way,” Jen-Jen shrugged, “Me bet y’all just jealous of how free us gobbos get to be, while humies gotta follow dumb rules.” The cheerleaders had mixed responses to that remark<br />
<br />
“I mean, I guess so,” Kimberly stroked her chin, seriously considering it, “I think I’d be like a cottage-core goblin if I were one of you guys.”<br />
<br />
“As if I’d wanna give up my height advantage,” Rachel crossed her arms.<br />
<br />
“Eh, it’d be cool for me,” Tanesha shrugged, “just so long as I still look damn good in green.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, if it doesn’t get in the way of my workouts too much,” Riley said, stretching.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been jealous of you since kindergarten,” Susan admitted, “You were always the smartest and the cutest back then.”<br />
<br />
“Well you can count <i>me</i> out, too,” Samantha interjected, “I’m not exactly down with goblin philosophy, all open sex and shit.”<br />
<br />
“Well want it or not,” Jen-Jen grinned mischievously, “TRANSFORM OR DARE, CHEERLEADERS?” The squad was frozen in shock. They couldn’t believe what was going on, that their secret weapon would turn on them like this! Or was this the goblin genius’ scheme all along? It didn’t matter, because in their panicked hubbub their minute ran out.<br />
<br />
“Now ladies,” Jen-Jen grinned, “me transform you and your families <i>all</i> into genius sex gobbos like me and Kyl-Kyl… and so on and so forth. Also me dare you all think you always <i>was</i> gobbos, and that reality retroactively rewrites so that this am true.”<br />
<br />
In mere seconds the six cheerleaders transformed into a sextet of sexy goblin girls. Their clothes teleported back into the lockers, resized for their new proportions, leaving them as naked as Jen-Jen. The room began to smell of damp moss and grass clippings as codification of its green skinned inhabitants.<br />
<br />
Kimberly, now Kim-Kim, was the most noticeably hourglass shaped goblin, with daisies threaded through her wavy blonde hair. Rachel became Ray-Ray, and was the tallest in the room by a good five inches, but with a wider booty than Jen-Jen. Tanesha, or Tan-Tan now, was about as shapely as Jen, except a little chubbier and with darker green skin. Riley, now going by Ril-Ril, traded in most of her fat for muscle and looked like a small, redheaded bodybuilder. Susan, now Sue-Sue, was only subtly hourglass shaped, sporting a slight belly that was just begging to get inflated with cum. Finally Samantha, or Sam-Sam excuse me, was shockingly skinny compared to the others although she didn’t look emaciated at all.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… what was gobbos hubbubing about?” Kim-Kim asked, scratching her crotch that was carpeted with blonde fuzz.<br />
<br />
“Y’know, me not remember,” Ray-Ray shrugged, “Maybe how good my insta-stilts are selling? Or how fat me Latin booty is?”<br />
<br />
“No, me no think it that,” Tan-Tan replied, licking her pointy teeth, “Maybe it was college plans?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, me think it was plans to make humie guys wanna plow gobbos,” Ril-Ril chuckled while she started doing push-ups.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, or orgy plans!” Susan suggested, adjusting her glasses and brushing her brunette hair out of her eyes, “Please tell gobbo it was orgy plans!”<br />
<br />
“Well it seems like <i>I’m</i> the only one who actually remembers being something other than a goblin,” Sam-Sam stated bluntly, causing the other girls to stare. She flipped her floor-length, jet black hair out of her face as she stared the others down.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Sam-Sam,” Kim-Kim approached cautiously, “am you okay?”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine, Kim-Kim,” Sam-Sam nodded, “I admit I was more than a bit skeptical about being turned into a goblin like this, but you know what? Kinda feels liberating. Before now, I held myself back, kept myself from being a hoe-bagging slut like the rest of you guys. I remember the talks behind my back about it, but I didn’t say anything since you accepted me because a goth at the time.”<br />
<br />
“Please,” Ril-Ril rolled her eyes, smirking, “with how many goths this school have? It no matter you am goth, yo.”<br />
<br />
“It <i>am</i> weird you have better grammar than gobbo,” Tan-Tan added, “Gobbo s’posed to have bad grammar, me thought.”<br />
<br />
“Are you <i>sure?</i>” Sam-Sam asked, “Doesn’t it seem more than a little illogical for goblins to have such poor grammar when you’re basically all super geniuses?”<br />
<br />
“Gobbo care more about quantum mechanics than grammar,” Sue-Sue explained, “No need obey something so arbitrary like that.”<br />
<br />
“If you say so,” Sam-Sam supposed, “but I prefer to sound as articulate as my brain is. Back on topic, though, I think I’ll stay like this for a while. Goblins don’t have to worry about human sex rules, right? I mean, incest and pedophilia are off the table just from a logical standpoint, but otherwise go ham, yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly! Gobbos no gotta be prudes,” Jen-Jen nodded, “Free love so long as it am safe, sane, and for most part consenting. That am gobbo sex philosophy!”<br />
<br />
“Well then, thank you for liberating me,” Sam-Sam grinned, “and the rest of us… and my family… how far back does it go?”<br />
<br />
“Just to your parents,” Jen-Jen said, “Us second generation gobbos in this reality. Me thinking about hitting grandparents, but me not sure how to do that.”<br />
<br />
“Aww, worry about that later,” Ray-Ray cut in, “Me wanna fuck some humies! Let’s go?”<br />
<br />
It was then that it occurred to Jen-Jen to check just how far reality warped. Checking the news on her phone revealed that not only was Glendale quickly becoming one of the fastest growing tech centers in the United States alone, but it was also a leader in clean and reliable energy. Plus, she noticed her phone was absolutely stuffed with text messages from not just the other goblins, but plenty of human classmates as well asking for sex with her. It seems that the more goblins there are, the more normalized <i>fucking</i> goblins becomes. She hoped it wouldn’t be long until she could fulfill her newfound fantasy of suddenly getting picked up and fucked in the middle of class and then passed around the room like a football to whoever else wanted to plow her field. Things were starting to come up Jen-Jen!<br />
<br />
The first goblin couldn’t believe it. The mere thought of living this new fantasy set her heart racing, her breathing to quickening, her green skin to start glowing with red blush. Her emotions were running so high that she lost control of herself and ended up emptying her bowels in the middle of the locker room. Grassy scented green manure pooled at her feet as urine ran down her legs. Of course, she didn’t care about that anymore, since as a goblin she didn’t have to care about it. She probably should take another shower though, seeing as she seemed to have a lot more pleasing humans to do. She <i>was</i> meant to be a fucktoy, after all.</p>
