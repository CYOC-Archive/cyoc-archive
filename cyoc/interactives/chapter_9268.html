<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time he got to the mirror, hair was already appearing on his upper lip. When he stared into his reflection he saw that he looked normal, only with a faint moustache. He pulled up his shirt. Nothing changing there... Jeff closed the door to the bathroom quickly, locking it. <br />
<br />
He looked back down at the Chronovac in his hands. On the screen it read in large red letters: &quot;Transformation: Active, Time Remaining 70 seconds.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff looked down again, still no signs of hair on his stomach, though he felt his legs itching. They really did itch, and he couldn’t help but scratch them. Jeff took his pants off quickly, then, he decided, to take his shirt of as well. Soon Jeff was only in his Boxers. Jeff looked back in the mirror. His moustache was slightly thicker, he could see it now, standing 3 feet away from the mirror. It looked darker too. He placed his hand on his upper lip, feeling the thin, soft hairs. He immediately felt a rush of excitement at finally having some hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transformation: Active, Time Remaining 52 seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked back down at his legs. They were noticeably hairier. He couldn’t help but scratch them. His groin itched too. He peeked under his boxers to see, in shock, his hair was much thicker down there. As Jeff scratched and moved his arms, he hairs brush against the underside of his armpit. He stood up straight and held his right arm up. Sure enough, there was much more hair there. Not too much, not too much at all, but just more than before. No longer was it a set of seven or eight scraggily hairs, but a normal amount, or at least, a visible amount! <br />
<br />
Looking back down at his legs Jeff noticed immediately how hairy his legs were getting. Sure it wasn't that much or abnormal, but it was much more hair than Jeff was ever used to. Still staring at his legs, scratching with his left hand just above his knee, Jeff absent-mindedly began to scratch just below the navel. He continued for a few moments, and then realized what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up, looking in the mirror. A quiet &quot;Whoa&quot; exited his throat as he saw his reflection. His moustache was more noticeable, much more. He shifted his weight and moved his face towards the mirror, inspecting it closely. How odd to see all those little hairs above his mouth. Plus, he noticed, fine and few scraggily hairs now jutted out from his chin. Maybe three of them, or four. <br />
<br />
Still scratching his navel he looked down at the Chronovac:<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformation: Active, Time Remaining 11 seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down &quot;holy shit!&quot; he exclaimed as he saw what appeared to be a little happy trail growing under his belly button. Sure enough, a few brown hairs were now growing up the base of his stomach, and starting to make their way up. He touched it, and felt the fine and thin hairs on his stomach. To his amazement, it was visible from the mirror. Somewhat faint, but completely noticeable. &quot;This was weird,&quot; he thought &quot;I need to shave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down at the Chronovac, it read in the same bold print:<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformation: complete&quot; The window was smaller it asked if you wanted to close it. Jeff closed that window and sat for a moment. He stared back at his reflection. The hair on his stomach, his little &quot;happy trail&quot; was a little weird, it didn’t feel like he thought it would. It seemed, almost, out of place on him. Looking back though, he noticed that the young man of 16 staring back at him looked very normal (albeit he needed to shave). With his moustache, he looked different, maybe even a little older, and his whole body took on a different appearance. <br />
<br />
Jeff was thrilled, and yet slightly weirded out at the same time. &quot;What should I do?&quot; he thought to himself... Jeff began to search the bathroom for any extra razors. Though today, he was in luck. When he opened the second drawer down he saw that there was a container of disposable razors (no doubt left by his older brother before he moved out). They hadn't been used. &quot;Perfect&quot; he said aloud, &quot;these are mine now&quot; he declared in a half-joking tone. There was a nice can of Shaving cream, though it looked rather old, right next to the razors. <br />
<br />
He looked back at his reflection. &quot;How strange,&quot; he thought- his mind still centered on his little happy trail &quot;yet wonderful&quot;. He examined him self closely while putting the shaving cream on his upper lip. No sideburns! He noticed it before, but he didn’t think too much about it. He really wanted sideburns, but there were none to be had. Jeff was slightly disappointed and began to shave, slowly. <br />
<br />
He never had done this before, so he did it very lightly, not wanting to cut himself. All he could shave, however, was his upper lip. Those scraggily hairs on his chin, he figured, weren't worth shaving. <br />
<br />
When he was done, he looked at himself in the mirror. &quot;Sweet!&quot; he said aloud. He still had a little stubble on his upper lip, stubble, just like he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damnit,&quot; he said under his breath &quot;I wanted sideburns&quot; he mumbled with an air of defeat. <br />
<br />
Jeff turned to his Chronovac. He stared at it for a moment, wondering what he should do next...</p>
