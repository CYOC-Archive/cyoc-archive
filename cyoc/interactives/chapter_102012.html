The unpleasant business from Wednesday behind them, everyone in Moon Lake woke to a bright, and optimistic Thanksgiving. <br />
<br />
“Morning.” Evan said, watching his wife start to stir. <br />
<br />
They were both still in their were forms, having spent the previous night releasing all the stress from their bodies. Well, not all the stress. Evan woke up sporting quite the morning hard on. And he was very glad Maggie was awake, so he wouldn’t have to deal with it solo. <br />
<br />
“What time is it?” Maggie asked, nuzzling closer to Evan. Like Spencer, when Evan stroked the back of Maggie’s head and neck she started purring. <br />
<br />
“Close to nine.” Evan said, licking Maggie’s nose. She giggled as his rough tongue tickled her nose. <br />
<br />
“We should probably get up. We’ve got to be at Elle’s around two.” she said, though she really just wanted to stay in bed the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
“There’s no rush. They only live half an hour away. Besides, your parents got to see you last night. I can have you for a few more hours…” Evan’s licking moved from Maggie’s nose and lips to her neck. <br />
<br />
“I do still have to finish cooking.” Maggie said, holding back a moan. <br />
<br />
“Uh-huh.” Evan wasn’t really listening. He’d started licking in-between Maggie’s breasts, and had moved his hand around her to stroke her tail. Maggie mewed softly, and let Evan continue. <br />
<br />
He smiled, and slide his hand to the very tip of his wife’s tail. The most sensitive part of the appendage, it was a lot like his own penis in that regard. His finger prodded the end, making small circles in her fur. Behind him, his own tail was frantically wagging in anticipation. <br />
<br />
Evan stopped fondling Maggie’s tail, and gave a sort of commanding growl. Maggie understood it as instruction for her to turn around. Which she was more than happy to do. They were both extremely aroused at this point. Maggie lifted her tail out of the way, presenting her black, furred ass to Evan and his dewy rocket. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Across the hall, Spencer was having her own pleasurable morning. Still sound asleep, after spending the majority of the night talking to Eric, her mind conjured up all sorts of dreams. And almost all of them focused on the two eventually taking things to the next level. <br />
<br />
<br />
In dream land…<br />
<br />
Spencer chased a thick, gray furred tail through the woods. It blended in well with the snow and pale moonlight surrounding her. The tail was suddenly airborne, and in the trees. Spencer smiled, and pushed herself forward. <br />
<br />
She leapt into the trees, her claws digging in to give herself some footing, and then she launched herself at the tail. They crashed into a snow drift below. And then the two weres were laughing. Spencer watched as the werecat before her shook the snow from his fur, and planted a kiss on her nose. <br />
<br />
“I guess I’m IT now.” Eric said, his bright ivory eyes staring at her. <br />
<br />
<br />
Spencer woke with a start. She was more than a little confused. Why where his eyes that color? What kind of cat had almost white eyes? Or maybe it was more like a pale yellow… <br />
<br />
“Definitely wasn’t a wolf. Or even a fox. A white lion or tiger maybe. Or a lynx… No the tail was all wrong for that. So what?” Spencer wondered. <br />
<br />
She didn’t dwell on the details of her dream for long. Spencer drifted back to sleep, reentering dream land. Though her dreams were notably void of Eric in that mystery were form. Just as is. Normal, for however long. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Far away from Moon Lake, Jeremy Bower woke to a very different kind of morning. In his cell, in a separate part of the prison due to his head injuries (a parting gift from Spencer), he heard a commotion as a new prisoner was being brought in. <br />
<br />
The man’s face was bruised, and he was handcuffed to the wheelchair they were pushing him in. Jeremy caught the man’s scent, and instantly recognized him. His face might be bandaged and beaten, but that was definitely the man who came to visit Jeremy yesterday morning. <br />
<br />
“Guess things didn’t go according to plan.” Jeremy thought amused. He did try to warn Hanson. You can’t sneak up on Evan Lawson. <br />
<br />
“Got yourself new neighbor Bower. Think of it as a Thanksgiving present.” One of the guards said. He opened the cell across the hall from Bower, and Hanson was carted inside. The guards removed his restraints, and then left the two inmates. Hanson looked up, his eyes filled with anger. <br />
<br />
“Why are you so smug? Still in prison aren’t ya?” Hanson growled. <br />
<br />
“I told you so.” Jeremy laughed. <br />
<br />
“Shut up you little piece of…”<br />
<br />
“I TOLD you!” Jeremy continued to laugh, “Didn’t I? Told you whatever plan my dear Daddy had worked up was bound to fail. And look at that, it did. Where is the bastard anyway?” <br />
<br />
“Dead.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” Jeremy stopped laughing. <br />
<br />
“Dead you little ingrate. He died trying to spring you from prison.” Hanson said flatly. Jeremy took a moment to process the information. His father was D E A D. <br />
<br />
Hanson was sure Jeremy would start apologizing, or maybe even start crying. But he didn’t know what kind of relationship (if you can call it that) the father and son had. Hanson was certain Jeremy had lost it when he started laughing again. <br />
<br />
“What kind of sick fuck are you?” Hanson demanded. <br />
<br />
“The kind who’s glad that jerk is finally gone. Who did it? Lawson right? I’ll have to send him a thank you present.” Jeremy said. Hanson stared at Jeremy in disbelief, while the latter laid back down on his bed. Suddenly his headache was gone, and he was in a much better mood.</p>
