<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maurice smiled as shi examined hir look once more, liking it more and more. Snowy actually came up and rubbed along the limbs that formed hir wings. &quot;I think I like this look better, Maurice, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As do I, Snowy.&quot; The two turned and kissed as they looked. &quot;I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t look fully like a partial chakat and pterodactyl. I mean the tail is nice, the forelegs are amazingly powerful and I got some wings. I guess I&#39;m a Jurassic version of Talia.&quot; <br />
<br />
Talia walked in and smiled. &quot;I had heard Snowflake and had to see for myself.&quot; Shi giggled and walked right up. &quot;Hmmm... not a bad look, Maurice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Talia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy smiled as shi took hir mate and decides it&#39;s time for their friends to see the new Maurice. They walked in and found they were having a council meeting, so they sat down. Charlie sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t like this, not one bit. Look, this chakat virus business is growing out of hand. I have little time to spend with my family cause of it. Look, Ronnie, you know the scientist that did this to  you. You&#39;ve seen her first hand. You are going to be taking a plane to meet Sammy along with Mikkie and Danna. Flake, you and Alexis are going to go to France with me and Sally. Luna and Lia may need help with being left in charge with Justin and Francine gone. I got word that all of Europe, majority of Africa and Argentina are going to be helping us put a stop to these outbreaks once and for all. My dear friends... No not friends. We&#39;ve come thus far, so far we are much more than friends. Everyone here is family. And those not here that we&#39;ve come to know and love. Snowy, you and Maurice will remain here to keep making the Retrovirus and duplicating the vaccines. We need all the vaccines we&#39;ve had used and are using. A science major friend of my dad&#39;s will be coming to help make the ultimate vaccine. The vaccine that will kill off every trace of the virus. And keep any new viruses from effecting. And this will also give some people the immunities that we kats have too. Raul is in Washington trying to help there. Sammy is on a air carrier. Janace, you will stay with Midnight and Talia. If I recall, we still have that scientist here. I wager you can come to an agreement with her, to have her help us find her friends. Nikole, Jess, you two will go with me. Dad, you are to go to Japan to aid there. The rest of you, will stay here and look after things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice smiled. &quot;Well, I suppose we can get to work then.&quot; Shi walked up to Charlie. &quot;Well said, and you&#39;re right. It is twelve years, make that thirteen years too far that we&#39;ve delt with a mistake me and Snowy made and now it&#39;s time to put a stop and focus on the important things. And I think, when you get back, perhaps suggest that France finds a new leader. For our family belongs here. Not in Paris, or London or anywhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken, Maurice. I miss my little girl, but right now until things settle down, shi&#39;s got a job to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that they all walked out and each kat went to the airport that was leaving to head to their destination, hoping this is the last time they will have to leave their home. Snowflake walked up with Janice and looked at hir parents. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are going to finish these outbreaks off for good, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. I hate having to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Maurice walked shi noticed the ambassadors were still there, so shi walked up to talk. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The UN has decided to, considering the coast is a target, we are moving the UN headquarters here.&quot; the Ambassador said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s splended. Well, I certainly hope you find it to your liking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve already have. All of you and your friends are very hospitable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was what the kats are meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you, Mr. Chakat.&quot; The ambassador walked on. Maurice then went on to hir lab to get to work.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Maurice long before shi noticed something was up with Snowflake. &quot;What&#39;s wrong sweety?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... well, it&#39;s just... well, I like Janice and I know.... I know I&#39;m young but I want to learn to become a mom. I know in six years it&#39;ll happen. And I know with who. We already decided that graduation day we&#39;d get married and... well, I want to learn what I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Snowflake, I know you and Janice are in love, dear. But don&#39;t rush into marrage just yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, enjoy what you got. When the time is proper you will know.&quot; Maurice looked at Snowflake. &quot;And don&#39;t worry about the mom stuff. You will be a wonderful mom. As will Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked on and Snowflake did smile. Hir dad was right. Shi would be ready when the time came. Then shi froze. &quot;There is one more thing. I was told by Bethline, that mommies and daddies hate their children if they get pregnant underage. It&#39;s what shi witnessed with hir mom and grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sometimes that is the case but not because he, she or shi hates them. It&#39;s because they are afraid my dear. And if you think your mom and I would hate you if you got pregnant at a young age, then you got another thing coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good. I mean... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice froze and then looked at hir daughter. &quot;What is it, sweety?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was.... it was an accident. Me and Janice were sitting there and our curiousity got the better of us.&quot; Shi pinned hir ears back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Janice make you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Shi stopped dead and looked down.<br />
<br />
Maurice was half expecting this to happen to some kats but hir own daughter. Shi pulled Snowflake into a tight embrace. &quot;It&#39;s okay sweet heart. Mom and I will be there to guide you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowflake started to cry feeling ashamed of hirself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, hun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice laughed. &quot;Well, that&#39;s normal. Now does your mom know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice sighed. &quot;We&#39;ll tell hir together, when we talk with Charlie and Sally. Though you know, I wager shi&#39;s going to be as cute as hir momma.&quot; Shi teased Snowflake, just to show that shi wasn&#39;t mad. Surprised, but not mad. The two walked together as Maurice now knew that the age when a kat came very fertile was real young.<br />
<br />
Snowy was waiting for Maurice, tapping hir foot. &quot;What took you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a father and daughter talk, dear. I&#39;ll explain later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, explain now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice looked. &quot;Trust me. I think it&#39;s best to wait for Sally and Charlie to get back. For the moment, Snowflake, I want you to go get Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowflake walked off as Maurice looked and sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry hun. I&#39;m just not going to repeat myself on the current situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maurice, what do you mean, the current situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Snowy, like I said, it&#39;s better to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that they went in and started to work. &quot;Fine, but as soon as they get back you&#39;re explaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice looked as Charlie and Sally walked in, having not yet left. &quot;Explain what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy looked. &quot;Well, Maurice has something to talk to us about. And shi&#39;s being stubborn on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that the two, Janice and Snowflake walked in, Janice and Snowflake both having ears pinned back. Charlie and Sally turned to look. &quot;What have you two gotten into?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice looked. &quot;Settle down, Charlie, they&#39;re not in any trouble. I think you may take into account that they think you&#39;ll hate them cause of what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked at Janice. &quot;Janice, honey, what happened?&quot; Janice looked for a moment and then at hir belly.<br />
<br />
Charlie looked. &quot;You two didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dad, we... we were curious and one thing led to another.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked at Maurice then to the girls. &quot;And you think that we&#39;d hate you cause of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie walked up and knelt down. &quot;Girls, we&#39;d never hate you. We love you both very much, but doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re not disappointed. But during the whole process, your mom and I will be with you both during the full process.&quot; Charlie then gave both a kiss on the forehead. &quot;Just realize that you two now have a big responsibility, and when the time comes a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know the choice. We won&#39;t give them up. We will take one hundred percent responsibility for them.&quot; Snowflake said.<br />
<br />
Snowy and Sally&#39;s eyes welled up with tears of pride in their daughters. &quot;Well, we certainly know how to raise them. Just next time, wait, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls nodded as they hugged each other then Maurice looked. &quot;So, I guess it&#39;s a good thing we&#39;re neighbors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally looked. &quot;Yes, and it would seem that we may miss the day you two have your first cubs. But... don&#39;t you worry. We&#39;re just a skip over the pond and if you need, we&#39;ll be home in a heart beat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded. &quot;Your mom&#39;s right. Now we best go before we miss our flight. Oh, I forgot, I came for something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Maurice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The retrovirus. I was thinking before we get to Paris, we could use it to restore some of those who were unwillingly turned back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice smiled. &quot;Good idea. Fortunately I have enough made that I have left overs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much of a dose?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, just maybe three cc&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; After they got the stuff the two parted and headed to Paris.</p>
