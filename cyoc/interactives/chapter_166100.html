<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;See ya later, Sean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean was now thinking about all the things that this amulet could do to his jock neighbor Mitch. How much control did it really have over him? If it was capable of turning Mitch right around and making him come back around, maybe it could do some other things too. Sean glanced down at the amulet, and thought about what he wanted to do. He didn&#39;t want to permanently do anything to the guy, that&#39;d be way too conspicuous and make it obvious something weird was going on. And plus, Mitch had a girlfriend and family.<br />
<br />
Sean thought for a while about it as he watched Mitch disappear into the distance around the block, and then decided.<br />
<br />
He was going to change Mitch, just for a while, and see how long it took Mitch to notice something weird was going on with him. First of all, he decided he was going to turn Mitch from a human man into a house cat. He got a full mental image ready to go - a white and gray furred large house cat. Fitting since Mitch was a pretty big guy. And it&#39;d be slow-rolled - he didn&#39;t want this to just snap and be done. He wanted to see just for the sake of some mischief how long it&#39;d take for Mitch to notice anything was awry.<br />
<br />
He focused on his mental image as he held on to that amulet, saying to himself, &quot;I wish Mitch would change into that cat that I have imagined...change, change, change!&quot; He didn&#39;t know if that last part was necessary or not, but he was not about to take any chances with it not working.<br />
<br />
And for his credit, Sean was able to detect an odd tingling electric sensation come off of the amulet. It was distinctly clear something was going on here. &quot;Now let&#39;s see how this goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Mitch was enjoying his morning run, feeling like a million bucks as usual. He didn&#39;t really know why he went back over to be social with that brat, but he guessed Sean being the kid who watched his dog made him feel at least a bit of gratitude for the little monster. He chuckled a little at the thought, barely noticing anything was awry. Even as he felt something akin to a strong, pleasant tingling sensation.<br />
<br />
Mitch adjusted his groin as he felt his manhood bunching up in his shorts. He didn&#39;t know WHAT was going on down there, but he figured as usual that working out got him a little bit randy. That was when he felt his phone buzzing in his pocket. Like most young guys, Mitch had a cellphone for use in talking with his friends and taking pictures. In Mitch&#39;s case, mostly pictures of him in the gym.<br />
<br />
Almost dropping the phone due to the feelings getting a little too intense, Mitch answered the phone and barely noticed hairs growing in up his back and his chest and abdominal hair getting thicker. &quot;Hey, Mitch here, just on my morning workout!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby, how&#39;re you doing? Would you be up for a date later today?&quot; Ah, so it was Mitch&#39;s girlfriend. The young man gave a slight grin that exposed slightly sharper teeth in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing babe...&quot; Aww fuck, Mitch thought as he tried to keep it cool out there. His manhood was really acting up, and it was getting honestly kind of inconvenient. How was he gonna keep running with this thing pulsing and looking like that in his shorts? &quot;Mm, would you be up to fool around a bit sooner than that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Mitchy,&quot; She said sounding a little pleasantly surprised that he wanted to do that but also simultaneously regretful, &quot;I need to take care of some chores around my apartment, and homework for college. You know how this Microbiology stuff is.&quot; Not many people expected the hot sorority sister to be scientifically inclined, but that was Tasha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, well, I&#39;m...I&#39;m probably gonna have to take care of it myself then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun, Mitchy, see you tonight!&quot; She said, and then ended the phone call.<br />
<br />
Swearing to himself at his lack of luck, Mitch started to think about pulling aside from the run into a nearby alleyway to take care of his pressing problems. His body was feeling spry, energetic and like he could move so quickly...but this was also resulting in his need escalating, it seemed, moment by moment. Mitch didn&#39;t know how long he&#39;d be able to take keeping his hands off of himself.<br />
<br />
He barely even noticed as he kept on and started coming around the bend near Sean again that his toes were starting to feel kind of funny. Almost too tight and uncomfortable in his shoes... Ah well, maybe he was gonna need to get some new shoes. Mitch was not really anticipating anything, though he tilted his head when he came back around and saw Sean just staring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man,&quot; Mitch said, blushing a little bit when he realized Sean could probably see his problem, &quot;How&#39;s...school on your end?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s uh...it&#39;s fine.&quot; Sean said and seemed to look aside as if trying not to make it obvious he was looking at something. Mitch took it to mean Sean was trying to not make it look like he was looking at Mitch&#39;s organ. He was really gonna need to take a breather from this run to take care of this problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;...You sure, man? You seem nervous about something.&quot; Mitch said and adjusted his shorts, starting to feel something beginning to ache in the tailbone area of his rear. It was slight, but it was enough to make him really wonder if he just needed to change out of these clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m fine, man, really...you just uhh, keep going on your run.&quot; Sean replied, looking Mitch over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Mitch shrugged and then started building up some speed as he continued on, &quot;I think I&#39;m gonna need you to take care of my dog tonight, man. Got a date with my girlfriend. You up for the usual pay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing!&quot; Sean shouted, wondering if by then Mitch would be wholly human or not...</p>
