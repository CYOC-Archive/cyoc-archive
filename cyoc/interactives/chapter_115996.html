<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sighed, and layed back down on the bed with your arms behind your head. &quot;Well if Master says to stay put until he returns to examine me, then I&#39;ll wait.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, and considering the time right now Master should return soon.&quot; Dust said <br />
<br />
&quot;Then the sooner Master can examine me, the better. I just hope that there isn&#39;t any side effects that I don&#39;t know about yet.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;If there were any other side effects then Master would have killed you by now if they posed a threat to us.&quot; Dust said <br />
<br />
&quot;True, but I still can&#39;t get over the fact that I&#39;m humanoid now. I mean I&#39;m not human, but I can walk on two legs, and I have what can be loosely described as hands.&quot; You said looking as your pudgy paw-like hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it would be more concerning if your transformation to this was magical, because then we would probably have to contend with someone or something whose magic outclasses Master&#39;s own magic. Thankfully though your change was more on a chemical, and biological level one could say, but ultimately a non-magical transformation like yours should be impossible. I personally think for that reason, and the fact that you have transformed because of the very infection that is plaguing the land will grant you with lots of publicity, or at least considering the city defenders.&quot; Dust said <br />
<br />
&quot;Public attention is nice and all, but I don&#39;t want to be the next famous person that everyone wants to be, especially considering that my condition was caused just by coincidence. I happened to consume an infected soul at the same time that I was bitten by an infected animal. Actually speaking of which...&quot; You said taking the tail you remembered you were bitten in by your hand to examine the area. To your surprise it appeared as if you weren&#39;t bitten at all, and you checked your other tails just to make sure too. &quot;Huh, there&#39;s no damage from the bite, guess it healed up or disappeared during the transformation.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
Just then you heard the door upstairs open, and you heard Harauphar&#39;s voice call downstairs saying,&quot;Dust, what&#39;s Wraith&#39;s condition like now?&quot; You sat up, and Dust walked upstairs, and said,&quot;Master your home, Wraith&#39;s actually in rather good condition. In addition to that he&#39;s awake, and he seems to be completely normal, and he even recalled events that took place prior as well.&quot; You then watched Harauphar and Dust walk downstairs, and Harauphar looked at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Master, this is an interesting situation I&#39;ve seem to have gotten into. Dust explained everything to me, and honestly this is kind of...weird, I guess is the right word to use.&quot; You said scratching the back of your head with a hand. You then saw Harauphar&#39;s eyes glow white, and you didn&#39;t know what to make of it so you looked to Dust who motioned back to Harauphar. Harauphar then sighed and said,&quot;Thank the stars, sky, and universe above. The infection hasn&#39;t effected your mental state, and it seems that you are going to play a key role in eradicating the infection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew, I actually thought you were going to kill me there for a moment Master.&quot; You said sighing in relief <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I would have if your mind wasn&#39;t stable, but besides that how do you feel?&quot; Harauphar asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Welllll,&quot; you began looking down at your body,&quot;I definitely feel more energized, and different. Different being that I am humanoid, and I can see infected now along with souls for some reason. There&#39;s a few other things that I feel are off, but it&#39;s hard to describe.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you should also know that your eyes are now changed too, and are purple like the other areas on your body. Also your magical aura has changed, and it appears that you are no longer able to use dark magic, or have potential to possess it at all. Instead it&#39;s replaced by...whatever magic your infected body can produce.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re saying I can&#39;t harness fel magic anymore, and I can only harness the infection?&quot; You asked and Harauphar nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever your potential is now I hope you perfect it on your own, and don&#39;t end up spreading it. Now when I found you infected, and transforming I only arrived that second. So Wraith inform me on how this transformation took place, or the events prior.&quot; Harauphar said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master, after I told you I was going to wander the forest I noticed everything in it was odd. Of course then I knew nothing of the infection then, but I eventually found some sort of purple fungi in the woods. It was then I thought that the fungi had something to do with the surrounding infection, and had a strong scent to them, so motioned to leave so that I may notify you as soon as I could. However I was ambushed by an infected wolf, and it bit my tail infecting me. In response to the bite I killed and devoured the soul of the wolf partially in the influence of the infection. Nothing much happened after that except my body slowly cramping up, and my natural sight vanished. Then I used my soul vision, and you were right there beside me like you were. You already know what happened followed that Master, and you know more than I do about that.&quot; You explained <br />
<br />
&quot;Wraith told me the same thing, and we think that his condition might have something to do with that infected soul he swallowed.&quot; Dust chimed in<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, perhaps not, perhaps a combination between the bite, and the soul. Nonetheless Wraith, you seem to have risen to a level that falls in a category that could never have been predicted. You&#39;ve also attracted quite the attention considering that I have had multiple colleagues assess your mind, and report it to be unchanged. Now I do the same, and your mind proves itself to be just as pure as it was before the infection, and unchanged is what I observed too.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god,&quot; you said <br />
<br />
&quot;However, many fear that your magic may cause the infection to spread, and you have also become a target for a few minor groups as a threat. Despite those groups I have received support from multiple large, and major organizations composed of mages, and those even more experienced than I am in magic in general, and are vast enough to grant you support where you may lack it.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least there&#39;s a brighter side to my situation. Just out of personal caution may I know if there are any extremist groups targeting me as a threat Master?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s at least one in each colony, and I actually have arranged for you to be moved to one for study by a group that I trust above all others. You are to be stealthy transported to the colony called Daragast, and will be given accommodations for sleep, shelter, food, and water. You aren&#39;t going to be seen here for a while, and I know not of the duration. However, I have friends amd sources within to notify me if anything critical happens to you or the organization while you are there.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;So, I won&#39;t be with you, or anyone I know thus far unless something happens, or they give me approval to return?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely, just be cautious about your surroundings, and make sure your senses are alert at all times. A representative shall be here tomorrow morning, and travel will be overnight. I have also been given an apprentice cloak to disguise yourself along the path there.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, well that&#39;s kind of...interesting, I&#39;d be lying if I said that I wasn&#39;t the least bit sad, but I don&#39;t really know why that is.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t get killed, and I hope that when we meet again that it will be in a situation as unchanged as when you first were summoned.&quot; Harauphar said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what time is it now? Just so I can get an estimate on when to prepare.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about midnight now, and you&#39;ll be leaving at night, so in the meantime do whatever you please, except for magic experimentation. We don&#39;t want to start up a new infection, and especially if the source is right here.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood Master, I will do as you command...I didn&#39;t mean for that to sound as cliche as it was.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by cliche?&quot; Dusk asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a word that expresses overused phrases, and principles on Wraiths old world.&quot; Harauphar said <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah anyways I&#39;m not really tired, so I&#39;m probably going to stay up as much as I can, and then sleep through the day. Not that I&#39;m nocturnal or anything, plus it will help come tomorrow.&quot; You said and Harauphar left with Dust.<br />
<br />
You layed back down in your bed again, and continued to get used to your new body. Eventually you fell asleep, and before you knew it you were awakened by Dust. &quot;Wraith it&#39;s almost time, prepare yourself for the journey ahead.&quot; Dust said and you got up to find a cloak and gloves laying beside your bed. You dawned the cloak making sure that it covered your legs, and many tails. You made sure that your hands, and feet weren&#39;t as visible either.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m good, or at least this is as much as I can do.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but be quiet just in case somebody we don&#39;t want is listening in.&quot; Dust whispered, and you nodded.<br />
<br />
You walked upstairs with Dust, and saw that the whole cottage was dark,&quot;Where&#39;s Master at?&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He left just in case anyone leaked information about this place, and I&#39;m still here to make sure you are ready. I am also the most capable in an escape situation like this because of my small body. It&#39;s time for me to signal, them. A man will come in and ask if someone could help with his carriage&#39;s axel, and you respond with,&#39;maybe allow me to assess the damage,&#39; got it?&quot; Dust asked and you nodded.<br />
<br />
You then saw Dust walk up to a window in the cottage and begin scratching at the glass. You then switched to your soul vision to see your surroundings better, and you saw a man&#39;s soul along with two others. The man approached the cottage with a torch and...</p>
