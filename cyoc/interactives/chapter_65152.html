<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stacy had tears in her eyes. She wiped them away and gazed down at her body. She was thin, and more than that, her skin was clear and smooth for the first time she could remember in years. Her breasts still pushed up a bit awkwardly she thought but she realized that this last change was what she had always really wanted. She may not be the prettiest girl in school but she could be normal, average. She ran her hands down her thin stomach, rubbed her legs together and nearly burst into tears. She would stop the game right here and leave, she didn't really want to become more... or less, she thought, less of herself. She knew Kylie wouldn't allow it though. She raised her head to thank Gwen but the words caught in her mouth. <br />
<br />
Two large bumps had just ripped themselves from Gwen's back and through her skimpy pirate top. Gwen was forced to hold the top on with her hands. The lumps started to elongate and grow outward. No! Stacy thought. She looked at the bug armed Kevin and gagged. Stacy didn't deserve that! Yet the almost bone like protrusions kept growing. They now reached nearly 5 feet each, and seemed much longer than Kevin's on her much smaller frame. The look on Gwen's face was a mixture of anger, disgust, and pain. The thin white bones seemed to splinter along their length, shooting out thiner offshoots, all in the downward direction. With a shake Stacy saw they now resembled large bone wings. Her thought was almost immediately confirmed. Along the bones pink skin began to grow and was quickly covered again with the sprouting white feathers. Soon none of the bone or skin could be seen at all and Gwen was left with two very large white feathered wings. She had a little trouble getting them to stay in position against her back but once she did Stacy almost laughed. She is becoming an angel, she thought, but saw the flaw quickly. An angel.. with claws?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Kevin trembled. Get it off! Get it off! The thought ran through his mind like a mantra. Bug arms? He hated bugs. Truthfully he was terrified of them, but he would never admit that to anyone, not even himself. The arms seemed to creak as he moved them and at first he tried to ignore them completely. It was impossible. He flexed the finger like tines at the end and then the whole arm. He paused for the first time, the mantra slipping from his head. These arms were powerful. He could feel the strength in them, and although they were much thinner than his muscled beefy human arms he somehow knew they were at least ten times as strong. Still, he did not want anything to do with this change any more. <br />
<br />
He looked across at his progress so far. The tall fat kid looked ridiculous. Kevin grimaced. The nerd Stacy was working on looked.. pretty. With her new body and skin and those breasts... he shook his head. I am getting my ass kicked he realized. He wasn't stupid. He was used to people thinking jocks were dumb and a lot of them were he admitted, but he was not one of them. Unlike many others he had earned the straight A's that allowed him to continue with sports. He had not been really focused on this little 'game', being to caught up in his new body but that had to change if he wanted to stand a chance at winning. He thought for a moment and finally made a decision. The boy tits that hung from the dork had given him an idea. He reached out a hand and cast the spell, only afterward did he notice he had used a bug arm. Get it off, get it off! He shivered.<br />
<br />
Across the stage Bryan swallowed hard, nervous at what the idiot would mess up next. The pudge melted from his body. His man tits faded, leaving his chest flat. His tall frame became lurpy but no longer bulbous, his stomach no longer looked like he had swallowed a basketball. Bryan could see his feet. Yet he kept changing. Beneath his skin his muscles grumbled and began to swell. His new stick like arms and legs filled, and curved. He flexed his arm and saw the bicep bulge, perfect and defined. His legs were powerful and rippled with muscle, not as much as a body builder but more than he had ever had, more even than Kevin. Bryan wiped his foggy glasses and gazed down wondrously at his new abs. <br />
<br />
Kevin had regained composure and watched his work. It was working perfectly. Not only had he got rid of the pudge but he had also been able to give him muscle tone and growth. He had decided that the boy must have a thyroid problem. He had been round and short, and the moobs had given it away. The thyroid regulated how quickly the body uses energy, makes proteins, and even regulates how sensitive the body is to other hormones. Kevin had counted on all three, but mostly he wanted Bryan's newly repaired thyroid to flood his body with testosterone and protein, almost like a huge steroid. The hormones had even cleared up the mild acne that had sprouted across his face. Bryan was still far from anyone Kevin would have hung out with however. His glasses stuck out like a sore thumb, his teeth were even worse. His hair still hung greasy in a ragged rats nest. <br />
<br />
But now, at least, he stood a chance of winning. That winged bitch was going down! He looked over at Gwen and grinned, she still had her hands on her breasts holding up her top. He winked and blew her a kiss and she glared back.</p>
