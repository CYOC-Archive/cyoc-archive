<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Hugo left his rejuvenating pod for the morning, he shot a look at the pile of dicked humans he had gathered at the previous frat party. Twenty. It hadn&#39;t been a very big number. He had hoped to get most of the men at the party dicked. In the end though, it had only seemed to be used as a way to punish their friends in games and through dares, alcohol helping. Hugo sighed. <br />
<br />
If not for Steve&#39;s end of the night request, he would have been almost ready to call the experiment completely inconclusive. With a small smile, Hugo started going through the penises and classifying them in order of size and willingness to get dicked. He had even managed to dick two ten inchers. Good enough to make even Hugo salivate. His fingers lingered a little longer on their dickheads, drawing out precum as many frat guys had done the night before. The biggest -- Jacob -- oozed clear, musky liquid. <br />
<br />
Hugo shook his head. No, wait, focus, he had to focus on the task at hand. With strong regrets, he put Jacob aside, promising himself to come back to the big dick for a bit of fooling around later. There were more cocks to look at.<br />
<br />
Hugo grabbed one long, skinny dick and pouted. He hadn&#39;t meant to get Perry dicked. The young man had been unconscious, passed-out drunk when someone had stolen his camera. There hadn&#39;t been a point to dicking him. His goal was to test how well he could manipulate humans into getting dicked, not just flash them all with his camera. Now he had an outlier in his data for no reason. <br />
<br />
The best thing to do would be to restore Perry to normal before he woke up and let him leave none the wiser. Otherwise, he was just screwing up his work. <br />
<br />
... If he could, however, manipulate Perry into *remaining* dicked, that would be PERFECT for his experiment! <br />
<br />
Although it would take a bit of prep work, but he had an idea on how to do that. Several of those human movies had excellent examples of humans tricking each others. He had studied them intensively before receiving this mission. Time to put his knowledge to good use. <br />
<br />
First, he needed to set the limits of this new sub-test. He couldn&#39;t use force, obviously, but if, after he had presented his arguments, Perry still asked to be changed back, Hugo would without question. Force had already been used to change him without consent, so further intimidation wouldn&#39;t gather any significant data. Manipulation only. Hmmm. <br />
<br />
Now, where were those subcuttaneous speaker chips his superior had given him?<br />
<br />
                                                                                                                      ***<br />
Perry recognized the throbbing pounding inside his head as the symptom of another night of getting black-out drunk. Uuuurgh, he hated the haziness that clouded his senses then. He felt numb all over, hell, he couldn&#39;t even feel his toes, his fingers. Honestly, it was like he had fallen asleep on all his limbs, somehow.<br />
<br />
Slowly, his sight started unblurring, at which point, he let out a cry of shock at the enormous man looming over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Model #7,&quot; the giant said, casually. <br />
<br />
Perry&#39;s body pulsed as the giant walked around, writing down something on a cinema screen-sized notebook with a pencil the size of a tree. A horrible fear clicked in his mind. &quot;W-what&#39;s going on? Who are you? Why is everything so big?&quot;<br />
<br />
The stranger -- a man with slow, deliberate movement -- looked around, one eyebrow raised. &quot;Hmm? I don&#39;t see what you mean, Model #7. Everything is exactly in the same proportions as before, nothing changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was when Perry noticed the weird things around him. He was lying, spread-eagle, it felt, on a warm surface, but he couldn&#39;t move, just stare straight ahead. There, on another table, were three containers full of whitish liquid, and weirdest of all, a single dildo floating in each of them. What... what kind of freak was this stranger? Had he been drugged? <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, tell me the truth,&quot; he insisted, trying to stand up, but finding out he couldn&#39;t. He was completely unable to move, though his torso felt stiffer than before... his mind hazier with something like pleasure.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I am telling the truth, Model #7,&quot; the giant patiently explained, pulling out a mirror the size of a roof. <br />
<br />
Perry&#39;s breath got caught in his... lungs? There, in the mirror, he saw a dick lying on the table, and it was a very, very familiar dick. He&#39;d played with it all the time, knew all the curves, the size, the shape. HIS dick. Right where Perry himself ought to be. That... He was his own dick! <br />
<br />
&quot;W-what? T-that, there&#39;s no way-&quot; he stuttered.<br />
<br />
The giant ran a finger alongside his shaft, making Perry shudder with waves of electrizing lust.  &quot;You&#39;re the newest model of synthesized penises created by Hogo corporation. A sex toy grown in a lab to give all the benefits of a regular dicking without the risk of STDs and the stiffness of a cheap dildo.&quot; Hugo rubbed his thumb right over Perry&#39;s slit. &quot;That&#39;s why we made you able to cum. The gushing is just one of the best part of sex with a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
His head felt... slick, humid. He was drooling transparent liquid over himself. And. Oh, that, that felt awesome. More, he, God, that guy better keep going or he - NO! No, he had to focus. He couldn&#39;t let himself get horny when there was something so earth-shattering happening! <br />
<br />
&quot;No! That&#39;s a lie. I&#39;m not Model #7, or whatever you&#39;re calling me! My name&#39;s Perry, I&#39;m a twenty-three years old guy studying in college! You can&#39;t trick me. You drugged me, I&#39;m sure, and then, then, you. You did something to me! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human?&quot; The giant said, amused. &quot;Oh, that was only the dream matrix,&quot; <br />
<br />
Perry&#39;s blood ran cold. &quot;The dream matrix?&quot;<br />
<br />
The giant shrugged, as if it was no big deal. &quot;I was running some experiment on trying to implant memories into objects. It seems it caused some confusion in you. Probably developped a mind of your own too, fascinating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a penis!&quot; Perry shouted, frantically trying to do anything but just lay there, like, like a penis. &quot;Stop saying that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, yes, Model #7, you&#39;re one of the more advanced prototypes. Why do you think you&#39;re the only penis talking in the lab?&quot; The giant grabbed what looked like a smaller, limp cock from the table and held it by the balls. With the other hand, he rubbed the shaft, getting it harder and stiff. &quot;See? Not even a sound from Model #4. We were testing to see if added sound effects like moaning would add to the sexual experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe you!&quot;<br />
<br />
A slight frown showed on the giant&#39;s face, and Perry almost feared what he would do. When the guy turned around to grab something Perry wanted to run away, but only managed a couple of twitches. Strangely enough though, the giant pulled a normal looking camera and a chord.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I&#39;ll show you, again,&quot; he said, rolling the chord around Perry&#39;s girth. &quot;Maybe another go at the matrix will help you understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a click<br />
<br />
For a split moment, Perry forgot the lab, the giant and the dicks all over the place. He was walking on campus, carrying a backpack of books and his laptop for his engineering classes. The semester had been hell and he was looking forward to some relief. Just a couple more hours... <br />
<br />
Just as he was entering the faculty, a blonde guy -- Danny, he had always known him by sight -- walked up to him with a sly smile. &quot;Oh, hey Brock, you&#39;re coming to the frat party tonight, right? Bryan invited all the chicks from the sorority next door.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perry -- Brock -- grinned and high fived his childhood friend. &quot;Of course, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock blinked as the cold air of the lab washed over his skin once more. What- he had been about to enter his advanced physic classes and - Perry stilled, his balls tightening and his foreskin pulling over his dickhead. He... He wasn&#39;t called Brock. But... he remembered being Brock. Friends. Family. It had all been so... real... <br />
<br />
And now he was back in this lab, unable to move, just hardening and softening like any other cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, this has to be a nightmare,&quot; Perry sobbed, spitting out little globs of cum. &quot;I... I&#39;m not a dick. I can&#39;t be a dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
But deep down, Perry knew he was lying to himself. How could it be otherwise? He&#39;d been so sure he was a guy called Brock just a moment ago. Perry? Perry was just a dream he had. He was Model #7. A long, skinny dick synthesized in a lab as part of a new generation of sex toys. <br />
                                                                                                                      ***<br />
Hugo kept a neutral, even face as Perry sobbed and moaned his fate. He knew that Perry was on the verge of giving up and staying a dick forever. Even if all his memories said that he had been human, Hugo&#39;s manipulations were good enough to make him doubt years of sensory experience just because of a simple data transfer from his dicking camera. Of course, he could always upload a few more days of experience into Perry, all from different men, obviously, and really hammer the point.<br />
<br />
But no, he remained casual, pretending to set up more experiments to create new perfect human cocks. <br />
<br />
He had prepared everything so carefully. <br />
<br />
A few harmless containment tanks for Brock, Danny and Bryan had set the atmosphere perfectly, even though they were only floating in some nutrient-rich aphrodisiacs. The liquid&#39;s cloudiness certainly hadn&#39;t been Hugo&#39;s doing, but he loved the effect. <br />
<br />
Then, there had been the microchip he&#39;d implanted just under Perry&#39;s skin. Of course Dave hadn&#39;t said anything when Hugo fondled him. Cocks couldn&#39;t talk, that would be silly. But the chip picked up on the electronicmagnetic activity of Perry&#39;s trapped mind and translated it exactly like his own original voice. The illusion was perfect. <br />
<br />
He had passed out before seeing the dicking camera at work and had no one else to talk to. With no knowledge of homans and extraterrestrials, how could Perry ever suspect he had been transformed through alien tech? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, are you going to give up on that human nonsense, #7?&quot; he asked slyly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; The dick twitched regretfully. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m sorry for wasting your time... owner.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hugo grabbed Perry and put a kiss on the cock&#39;s head. &quot;Perfect. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve seen reason. Now, there is plenty more testing we need to do. Get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had been planning to use Jacob, but simply the thought of getting Perry to successfully accept his new existence as his own dick had Hugo&#39;s cock stretching his pants. Fuck, he was going to have fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you lubed up.&quot;</p>
