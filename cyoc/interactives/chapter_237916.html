<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before the men could respond, a commotion at the far end of the main pool could be heard. Caroline and the men turned their heads to see four woman arriving and already turning heads. She smirks as the make there way towards her.<br />
“Gentlemen,” she turns to them smiling; “my friends have arrived. You wouldn’t mind if they also joined”, Caroline smiled. Seeing their looks and pitching tents in their speedos, she knew they weren’t going to refuse as she steps into the hot tub. The warm water flowing over her legs as she steps in waist deep; she sighed as she sat down next to an auburn man who stills has acne. Giving him a slightly boyish charm, Caroline wonders if he got carded before being let in. She grins as she watches him blush after placing a hand on his thigh; caressing it as the meremaid virus quickly infected the water in the hottub and everyone else in it.<br />
<br />
“Caroline!”<br />
The first to arrive at the hot tub glares at her friend and along with five guys sitting in with the jets going.<br />
“I hope you intend to share,” the woman giving each guy a firm once over as she steps in the hot tub; unaware that a contagious virus was rapidly replicating and infecting everyone.<br />
“I take it,” Carline sipping her drink in mock disappointment; “you are off cunnies and dykes?”<br />
“I can make an exception for yours,” the woman smirking; responding with a playful splash of water. “But I’m a girl with needs,” she pleads with mocked innocence; “and this girl wants a big thick cock to squeeze.” She adds as the mermaid virus now infects her and is encouraging her desire to seek out a mate; working at her mentally to inevitable mere-hood.<br />
<br />
“There will be for time for that Jean,” Caroline rolling her eyes before turning her gaze back to the young man she was sitting next to. Caroline was unsure but she thought he looked more defined then the prior adolescent appearance she noted earlier. She puts it off her mind as a second female followed by a third show up. The two woman were identical twins named Iris and Violet respectively. While they both sported the same blonde bob, Iris was wearing a purple two piece bikini, while her sister Violet opted for black and white checkered pattern bikini. She also had a red nose stud in the shape of a diamond; while Iris had matching ear studs in the shape of black spades.<br />
“I, V,” Caroline looking at the twins as they sit next to each other; the twins sandwiching themselves between two men, one black and the other Hispanic looking. “Where is Judy?” <br />
<br />
“Speak of the devil and she shall appear!”<br />
A red headed woman with an icy cold stare that could turn anyone to stone if possible speaking as she was holding several drinks.<br />
“Unless you want them to spill I suggest you grab you liver pickler juice,” she grunts; nearly spilling the fruit drinks as she stumbles into the hot tub.<br />
“More like diabetes in a straw,” Violet grimaces as she recoils from the super sweet liquid splashing in her mouth.<br />
“Its supposed to be sweet,” Iris responding; “it cuts the burn from the alcohol.”<br />
“And speeds up feeling loose,” Jean taking a satisfying sip from the glass in her left hand while her right hand is groping the man sitting next to her; feeling his large package getting bigger from her playful grab.<br />
<br />
“I see you got yours already,” Judy looking a Caroline sipping her cocktail; eyeing her friend with a lustful look. Her gaze lingering over her friend’s toned figure and ample breasts. Unaware that Caroline was infecting her and everyone in the hot tub; dooming them all to become mermaids.<br />
“I arrived first,” Caroline answering; adjusting her bikini top as it felt a bit snug. “I always wanted to check this place out,” she adds as she lowers herself into the hot tub and adjusts the strings. Loosening them before sitting back up after adjusting; Caroline calmly grabbing her drink to take a sip as the men stare agape that she would do that so casually.<br />
“And already putting on a show,” Judy grinning as the mermaid virus was already affecting her libido. The red head that was the shortest among them was by no means meek. She had a take no shit attitude and wasn’t afraid to back up her opinion with a few choice kicks and punches. Thanks to her father a retired submarine captain, Judy knew who to defend herself hand to hand or with a knife. In fact she had a push button switch blade secreted between her breasts and bikini top; managing to smuggle it in, Judy wasn’t about to enter a borderline sex club without some form of protection other than a rubber. Judy’s gaze was drifting onto Caroline, the man sitting next to her as well as everyone else in the now full hot tub. She licked her lips hungrily as thoughts of lapping up honey and getting filled up by a man&#39;s virile seed flooded her mind.<br />
<br />
“Does anyone find it odd that a bath house slash swingers club set up shop on a pier above the ocean below,” Jean sipping her drink dry as she signals a bar for another round of drinks.<br />
“Why do you think its odd,” Iris sighing as the black she sat next to was shoving a hand down her bikini bottom and not bothering to hide it. “Yeah that’s the spot,” Iris cooing as she lazily closes her eyes in blissful contentment while feeling large fingers press her button and explore her entrance.<br />
“Well apart from you getting finger banged,” Jean gasping as a hand could be felt stroking her inner thigh; the man with greasy looking hair caressing her freshly shaven leg. “And these drinks being strong; if any of you managed to notice,” Jean gasping as fingers grope around her bottom; teasing and caressing her entrance. “That there is a diving board just outside of the patio behind you.”<br />
<br />
Violet managed to turn her head and through half closed eyes she could see the diving board in question. Thoughts of swimming in the cool waters of the ocean and tasting the salt on the winds pulled her out of the heady sexual desires she was in.<br />
“Ooooooh I wonder if they will let us take a dip,” Violet looking to get out of the hot tub. Heading to the window she notices that it was a large patio door that opened up to a screened off section of the pier. There were stacked chairs off to the side with the tables pushed up next to them. The patio looked to be closed down for the fall season, yet Violet wanted to be outside and in the ocean; unaware that it was the mermaid virus implanting new urges and desires into her brain.<br />
Fortunately, her twin sister Iris was able to stop her from opening the door; guiding her back to the hot tub. They first entered the main pool to avoid a staff member from checking on the door; that staff member scolding Violet to not open the door unless she and her party want to get kicked out. There brief foray in the main pool allowed them to spread the virus to nearby patrons. The waiter wading by to hand off drinks to a couple by the bar getting hit with the virus; as the twins make it back to the hot tub and back into the arms of the men who are clearly eyeing the girls lustfully.<br />
<br />
“So what drink did you pick Jean,” Judy finishing her first cocktail and looking to see that same waiter come to them with a tray of drinks.<br />
“Sex on The Beach,” Jean responding; “getting an audible snort from the men and Caroline; “I don’t know why, but that is the one thought I have at the moment.”<br />
“There is a beach just outside,” Violet perking up; “we could use the dive and swim in the waters to get there!” Violet almost shouting her desire just as the waiter arrives with a round of drinks for everyone. Before he can walk off, Violet lunges for him with a pleading look and asking him to let them use the dive board.<br />
“I’d loose my job,” the waiter gently pulling away from the girl’s grasp; “plus it’s November and winter is just around the corner.” The waiter adds, unaware that he was now fully infected and he too started to spread the virus as it worked to first change him mentally before physically. “But if you wait an hour,” the waiter looking about; “when the fog machines kick in, you might be able to sneak out when everyone is distracted,” the waiter looking at Violet and the rest of the group, seeing them all start to get that same look before quickly returning to the bar.<br />
<br />
“So let’s do it,” Violet looking uncharacteristically dominate; “when the fog rolls in we bolt for patio and to the ocean.” Violet looking at everyone who like her was looking more defined and well endowed. Hers and her sisters breast looking larger, their hips wider along with the other girl’s. While the men looked more broad shouldered with chiseled abs and their packages straining in the speedos that all were tugging at uncomfortably.<br />
“Sex on the beach, and i&#39;m not talking about the drink,” Jean sighing as she sips her new cocktail; “I can hardly wait. I got an itch that needs scratching at hard,” Jean looks at man next to her; unaware that scales started to appear around her breasts as well as peppering her legs and eliciting a dull itch. Jean was also unaware that everyone else was also feeling a dull itch in their legs as she sighed; enjoying the male touching her as she allows to water to sink up to her neck.</p>
