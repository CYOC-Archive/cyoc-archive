<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James placed a steady hand against Darius&#39; shoulder. The little guy hadn&#39;t taken his liquor well. He staggered and his words slurred. He barely had the mind to keep his loose lants from slipping down his backside, offering many whistling patrons a glimpse of a tiny little bubble butt. James threw a cautious glance around the room as he maneuvered his hands protectively around Darius&#39; back, helping him off the barstool and towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; he said, his voice as gentle as possible. &quot;Let&#39;s get you out of here. We&#39;ll try and get some help for you in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius at first seemed willing to relent. He stumbled forwards, falling into James&#39;s chest. His thin features were so cute that way, his eyes half-closed. It was hard to believe he&#39;d been a hulking brute at the beginning of the evening. James resisted the urge to reach across and stroke the stubble on his cheek. Despite his small size, Darius at least had all his masculine body hair. A tiny fuzzball, James thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So scared,&quot; Darius slurred into James&#39;s chest. &quot;Just wanna be safe. Wanna be big again.&quot;<br />
<br />
James felt his heart skip a beat. He pulled the tiny man close and hugged him protectively. Maybe it was the size difference, or his natural empathy for a guy having a terrible night, but James felt the desire to ensure nothing worse befell this vulnerable man in his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got you,&quot; James whispered. <br />
<br />
He made a mistake then. He kissed Darius on the top of his head. It had been thoughtless, the sort of thing that felt completely natural to do. But this wasn&#39;t a natural situation.<br />
<br />
Darius shoved himself out of James&#39;s arms with a shriek. He looked up, red eyed and tearful at the larger man. James didn&#39;t know what thoughts had possessed him, but he could only watch in stunned silence as the scruff of fur along Darius&#39; jaw and along his body receded. It was like watching someone draw an eraser all along that tanned lean flesh. If James hadn&#39;t been so concerned for this man, he would have found him even more adorable now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Darius, something&#39;s happened again,&quot; James said. He tried to strike a calming tone. &quot;You&#39;re still changing. We have to get you home. Safe? Remember? You wanted to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off! Fuck you!&quot; Darius yelled, and his voice cracked as it rose in pitch. His hair grew longer as well, extending now over his ears to lie flat against his neck. He didn&#39;t look a day over 19.<br />
<br />
James looked around. Some of the other stallions were closing in, licking their lips. This was bad. Some of them seemed to have figured out what had happened. James could tell by the growing erections of the men in the room that they were really getting into the idea of watching this once big hairy stud diminish into a fragile shrieking twink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darius...&quot; James said, his voice slow. He stopped. His voice sounded so much deeper than he was used to. This was getting surreal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t fucking tell me what to do!&quot; Darius said in his now childish voice. <br />
<br />
His lips plumped and he had to part his stance as his hips widened noticably. He lost more height, dropping down to an even more petite 5&#39;2&quot; but gained it elsewhere as the lusty patrons saw his ass inflate to the size of watermelons.<br />
<br />
James meanwhile felt his height shoot up and hair begin to race across his body with an itching tingling sensation that wasn&#39;t entirely unpleasurable. He shook his head as the protective feelings over the diminishing angry twink in front of him grew. He was ready to fight off all these bulls to protect his boy.<br />
<br />
His boy. He almost popped a boner thinking about it. He watched as Darius continued his drunken temper tantrum, each foul word or angry gesture only caused him to grow lighter and daintier, more effeminate and pretty, while James proceeded to grow more rugged and masculine.<br />
<br />
James had enough. He walked forwards and with gentle hands scooped Darius off the ground. The tiny boy was just a few inches under five foot tall. He slipped out of his shorts, wearing only an oversized shirt that draped past his thighs. James caught a glimpse of the boy&#39;s diminished cock. He felt a stirring in his own pants and figured out where it had gone.<br />
<br />
Some of the guys approached as he carried Darius out of the bar. The thrashing twink only seemed to squirm and shrink in his arms, still uttering vile obscenities. James gave the aggressive bulls a domineering glare and they backed down instantly. Of course they would have, James was pushing 7 feet tall at this point, a pillaring tower of masculinity. None of them would get in the way of his mission.<br />
<br />
Darius had fallen into quiet pitiful sobs by this point. At the last curse word James had felt the boy&#39;s ass ripen yet again, looking absolutely massive on the boy&#39;s tiny 4 and a half foot frame. James tried not to get a boner himself thinking about how disproportionate Darius was becoming.<br />
<br />
By the time they left the bar, Darius had fallen asleep in his arms. A tiny twink with a large bottom curled against his chest, looking angelic and sweet nestled in his daddy&#39;s facial hair. James thought he might never let this boy go.<br />
<br />
As they entered into the cold night, James removed what was left of his leather jacket and wrapped the boy up to keep him warm. His own clothes were all but shredded after the constant surges of growth, and his toes had long since burst forth from his shoes. For whatever reason he didn&#39;t mind the chilly air.<br />
<br />
His feet crunched against the snow as he made his way into the parking lot looking for his truck. He halfway wondered how he&#39;d fit inside with his new massive frame. He considered walking back to his apartment, but didn&#39;t know if his boy would make it that far in this frigid weather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Settling into your role nicely I see,&quot; a masculine voice purred behind him.<br />
<br />
James looked to see a man dressed in the same outfit Darius had worn at the start of the night. His brow furrowed. This was the creep who&#39;d done this to them, changed them. His sense of morality spurned his anger...but also looking at the precious bundle in his arms, he wondered if he was really all that unhappy with what had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put him back, please,&quot; James said, surprised at the ruggedness of his own voice. &quot;You know he won&#39;t survive on his own like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Course not,&quot; the man said. A wicked gleam flickered behind his eyes, burning like cigarette embers. &quot;That&#39;s what I have you for. All his size and masculinity has drained into you. I realized an asshole like that was bound to get himself hurt, so I tapped on some of your naturally heightened empathy and tweaked it in regards to one person. You&#39;re connected now. You will do anything to protect him, and in exchange, anytime he acts rude or ill mannered or even just thinks something like it, more masculinity and size gets drained into you. But it&#39;s not all bad, I&#39;m a kinky fucker so I&#39;ve made it that in with whatever he loses he gains in other areas, like that delicious rump.&quot;<br />
<br />
James couldn&#39;t help but feel the enlarged ass in his hand. While the rest of Darius was tiny enough he could cradle his whole body with one arm, the boy&#39;s ass spilled out obscenely. It was so soft and round. Truly the perfect bubble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; James asked, brow furrowing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I like making the world a better place,&quot; the man said shrugging his shoulders. He turned to the side, showing off how the streetlamps made jagged shadows across his perfect cheekbones. &quot;Darius entered a lonely man. An absolute ass. Now he will leave loved and protected...with a perfect ass. You are a good and decent man and get rewarded with power, strength, and an obedient boytoy to love and dote on. If he wants his old life back, he will submit to you. He will be kind and good. By that point, he might not even want to go back to the way things were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t mess with people&#39;s lives like that,&quot; James said. His voice was surprisingly calm despite the rage building inside him. His masculinity had always manifested as such, even before the changes. No amount of growth would still his gentle heart. &quot;It&#39;s cruel and twisted. You don&#39;t have the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man smirked. &quot;Well, if you think restitution really is in order, when all is said and done I&#39;ll let you two change positions for the same amount of time you took caring for him. If that&#39;s what you want that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not what I want at all,&quot; James said, his voice gruff but still soft and gentle. &quot;For now I&#39;d like you to leave us alone. You won&#39;t hurt me or my boy again. Clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked touched for a moment, until James realized all sweetness in the man&#39;s eyes was nothing more than a show. The muscular man shrugged his shoulders and turned to walk away, sliding his hands into the pockets of his denim jeans. A malevolent chuckle echoed on the wind.<br />
<br />
&quot;James, you&#39;re angering me, so allow me one last cruelty,&quot; he said. &quot;Whatever love you feel for that boy is my magic at work. When the spell is over you will feel nothing for him. Anything you experience is an illusion. Let that ring over your head in a few hours when he&#39;s calling out your name and your feelings ignite. All the heaven to come is a lie, and when it&#39;s over, you will feel pure hell. Goodnight boys! Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cackling, the mysterious man vanished into the night. James stared, his eyes full of rage and sadness. He curled Darius tighter to his chest and set him in the passenger side of his truck. Climbing in on the other side proved a challenge, and he had to adjust the seat as far back as it would go to even think of fitting.<br />
<br />
He glanced back at Darius curled up on the seat next to him. That mysterious warlock was right, this was cruel. James felt nothing but love for that tiny little thing in that moment. Knowing it wasn&#39;t real stung worse than anything he could imagine. It was like experiencing the most beautiful sensation with the knowledge beforehand that it would all end soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll fix this, Darius,&quot; he whispered. &quot;But you don&#39;t gotta know what I do. You don&#39;t need anymore hurt tonight. Sleep tight. Daddy&#39;s got this.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a frown and pangs of sadness in his too large heart, James drove the vehicle out of the bar and began heading home. He carried his new boy upto his apartment and tucked him into bed. He&#39;d get him more fitting clothes in the morning.<br />
<br />
As he left the bedroom to go sleep on the couch, Darius rolled over in bed, presenting that deliciously huge ass to him. James growled in frustration and took his pillows and blanket to sleep on the couch. He jacked off long into the night.</p>
