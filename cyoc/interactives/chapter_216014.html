<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The class went crazy coming up with ideas, finding volunteers, and working on how to organize everything. They kept coming up with new attractions and trying to incorporate them up to the final day. The nature of some of the transformations and entertainment made it difficult to keep all of the attractions running without attendees volunteering. There were many attractions but here were some of the headlines and how they came about.<br />
<br />
The Cat Cafe<br />
<br />
Over the next few weeks, the spell that had turned Tabbie into a cat weakened. She slowly grew into a large cat, and then started to gain some anthropomorphic features.<br />
<br />
She was able to rejoin school, though now she was referred to as Tabbie the Furry. Eventually her ability to speak returned, though she had developed a new speech impediment that acted up every time her words strayed too close to a mewing sound. Tabbie tried to warn people about Miss Mona, but they would just scratch her under the chin and say, &quot;silly kitty.&quot; While the spell&#39;s effectiveness on her waned over time, everyone else was still completely under it. Miss Mona seemed to prevent her from causing trouble by make sure no one took the class pet seriously. <br />
<br />
As the school festival&#39;s preparations continued, Tabbie&#39;s continued to regain her humanity. Her fur recede, and her usual hair returned. People stopped calling her a furry and started referring to her as a cat girl.<br />
<br />
Considering the cat ears on her head, and tail that swished behind her, she may as well be one from one anime or another. She also noticed her pupils were still slits like a cats.<br />
<br />
While Tabbie could attend class again, even if everyone was more patronizing, an odd part of the spell that held on was that she couldn&#39;t go home. If she did go home, her parents would just tell her they didn&#39;t own a cat and send her back out. Tabbie would ask about their daughter, but they would just say she was out completing a school assignment. It was similar to how Jade&#39;s parents would say she was hanging out in Mr. Rivera&#39;s classroom if you asked where she was. They were vaguely aware, but completely unconcerned. <br />
<br />
They would greet her as Tabbie, they would admit they had a daughter named Tabbie, but they would not admit that she was their daughter even though they did seem to recognize her. <br />
<br />
Since Josh said he would take care of the class pet, Tabbie had no choice but to stay with him. His parents didn&#39;t mind no matter how much she reverted to humanity. Like her own, they wouldn&#39;t admit she was anything other than a cat, despite having in depth conversations about what was happening in school.<br />
<br />
Tabbie actually liked staying with Josh. It was the one good thing to come out from Miss Mona showing up. Unfortunately, it had a major downside. She kept thinking of him as her owner, and found she couldn&#39;t call him anything other than master. Even while her cat speech impediment improved, this verbal tick held on strong.<br />
<br />
This of course led to someone having an idea of using Tabbie as the poster girl for a cat themed maid Cafe at the school festival. The various foods would cause different levels of animal transformations. One student suggested that they could follow Tabbie&#39;s example, and have a couple special where one gifts themselves as a pet to the other. Tabbie argued that she didn&#39;t gift herself, but her defense fell on deaf ears. Josh simple reached over and scratched her chin, ending any dispute in a string of purs. <br />
<br />
Cheering for Piñatas<br />
<br />
The students had gotten to watch the video of Samantha being beaten as a piñata. The kids cheered as candy flew everywhere, and afterwards a few went back to finish smashing the remains.<br />
<br />
They were returned to Miss Mona and was in the process of being repaired. It was difficult considering how much of the piñata had been torn to shreds. The cheerleaders saw the video as well, and all thought it looked like fun. They agreed to do an auction.<br />
<br />
Considering the limited number of cheerleaders, there was a lot of debate on how to handle the sale. They could auction each cheerleader individually, however auctioning off high-school cheerleaders was problematic. They finally settled silent auction. <br />
<br />
While auctioning off girls was frowned upon, buying piñatas was perfectly legal. The piñatas were just &quot;coincidentally&quot; named after the cheerleaders. They decided to add some unique rules to this auction. Periodically, whichever cheerleader had the highest bid at the time would be transformed in front of whatever crowd happened to be there, and presented to the winner. The minimum required bet would be raised after each prize was awarded. If the bets don&#39;t reach the new minimum, they would would not be sold until someone bet higher than that.<br />
<br />
There was some concern that not all of the cheerleaders would be sold with how high the minimum would be for the final few, but it was decided that those left over after the last auction would be recycled as volunteers for the Sweet Shop.<br />
<br />
Sweet Shop<br />
<br />
The sweet shop was the idea of of one boy, Dave, who was an aspiring confectionery. He dreamed of making sweets. Miss Mona decided to help him in her own way.  <br />
<br />
Dave was given a store for the festival where he could use a large chocolate fountain to make sculptures. He had found some guys and girls to be the initial statues for sale, both in whole or in pieces depending on how much people were willing to pay.<br />
<br />
After that he would be reliant on people offering themselves to be turned into chocolate for whoever they were dating, their parents, or any other loved ones they may enjoy a special treat.<br />
<br />
He was hoping to get a special donation from the cheer squad later in the day, but he wasn&#39;t sure how likely that was.<br />
<br />
Fashion show<br />
<br />
Sasha had inspired the fashion show. She was turned into a mannequins and had been showing off her designer outfit for a while now. A couple of the girls thought it would be fun to find volunteers to put on a fashion show.<br />
<br />
Each volunteer would wear outfits that were donated by local stores, and then turn into mannequins. Unlike Sasha, most of the mannequins would keep their faces.  Being able to recognize the mannequins was apart of the appeal to some. A few decided to hide their faces, but most would keep them.<br />
<br />
Haunted Maze<br />
<br />
Jade would be changing jobs from classroom skeleton to spooky decoration. She would have chains tied to both her boney arms, and hung over the entrance of the maze. There was also a picture of Jade, with her birth date and the day she turned into a skeleton that would hand around her neck.<br />
<br />
The maze itself would be filled with volunteers who would be turned into various creatures of the night. Goblins, boogeyman, and even a pack of werewolves who were going to turn anyone they caught into a member of the pack.<br />
<br />
The maze was filled with many challenges. Riddles, puzzles, hidden keys, and of course the creepy crawly monsters to chase people around the complex maze. With all of those obstacles, everyone knew it would need to have some pretty big reward.<br />
<br />
After discussing it among themselves, and getting the permission from both Jade&#39;s parents and her current owner, Mr. Rivera, they decided she would be the prize. They could have her as a decoration in her current form, or revert her to normal for a date or something. Either way, everyone who would walk under the hanging skeleton would get a good look at their prize. Despite being somewhat of a recluse, Jade was very popular because she was pretty. There would be no shortage of people trying to win her.<br />
<br />
Playground Nostalgia <br />
<br />
Inspired by Daniel becoming the four year old Danielle, they designed a playground that allowed the people on it to return to simpler time. The playground would cause everyone who stepped on it to regress to an appropriate age.<br />
<br />
Miss Mona personally took inspiration from Tabbie&#39;s condition and made it so that upon leaving, people would return to normal at a much slower rate. She figured some adults wouldn&#39;t mind spending time as a teenager again after getting some childish behavior out of their system.<br />
<br />
Tunnel of Love<br />
<br />
No festival would be complete without the tunnel of love. This one was a but different however. A couple would sit on the boat, and travel down a river that would show them various scenes of love.<br />
<br />
Throughout the journey, a slow change would overcome the two love birds. Once they reached the other side, the roles of boyfriend and girlfriend would be reversed as whoever entered would exit as the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
While it was required for each ride to have two people, they weren&#39;t required to be an actual couple. It was encouraged that those who were curious and wanted to experiment should come early and give it a try.<br />
<br />
There was a warning that the tunnel of love needed a second run through to return to normal, and it would be closing earlier than a lot of the other rides.<br />
<br />
There were plenty of options for the festival attendees to chose from. Where would you like to start?</p>
