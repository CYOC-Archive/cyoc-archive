<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s a slow morning, so you could really use some coffee. Conveniently, one of the first shops you see is a Starbucks.<br />
Waiting in line, you get to the counter and ask for something simple: a random cappuccino and some doughnuts.<br />
<br />
You wait for a few minutes, and once you get called, you retrieve your order and take a seat in one of the couches at the back of the shop.<br />
You take a sip of your coffee, and you&#39;re met with a rather unpleasant surprise. It&#39;s very badly mixed, some places feel lukewarm and some others are very cold. You sigh as you keep drinking it. Even though it&#39;s not good, you&#39;d rather drink it in silence than make a fuzz about it.<br />
<br />
The experience gets way worse with time, and you grow increasingly more annoyed, the coffee powder is still floating around, forming a dense, gross mass that builds up on your lips, and the drink has an almost plastic taste.<br />
You try to ignore this, but you can&#39;t help but think about how bad the service is, and how much you wanna stand up and express your disgust for such a mediocre coffee. But why? You&#39;ve never gave things like this much thought. You try to repress these feelings and carry on.<br />
<br />
You then eat one of the doughnuts. It&#39;s dry, coarse, and mouldy, and you think that it was made days ago, stored, and sold to you just to make fun of an innocent client. But that&#39;s not true is it? You can&#39;t help but feel humiliated and... Angry. Furious.<br />
You almost stand up but force yourself down. You struggle to repress these strange urges, but manage to keep eating more doughnuts in silence.<br />
<br />
You can feel heat in your head. Your rage is slowly building up with every bite and every attempt to contain your fury. Your mind is boiling, and the annoyance and anger makes you feel like your head is about to burst. <br />
Knowing that you won&#39;t let go, the furious thoughts take a different approach, and spread throughout your whole body.<br />
<br />
The thoughts begin remolding your body into something more explosive, easier to anger and have express itself.<br />
You slowly begin to age as you feel numbness in every tissue.<br />
You lower your shoulders as they lose definition and gain roundness.<br />
Your spine crunches as your height changes, you&#39;re now a smaller 5&#39;5.<br />
Your torso begins to lose their tone and angle, and plumps out a bit. You&#39;re not overweight, but your body has a certain cushiony plumpness to it.<br />
<br />
Your arms soften as they gain female delicacy, although keeping most of their strength, keeping a rather toned appearance.<br />
Your hips expand outwards, your thighs expand and gain soft plumpness, and your ass balloons outwards. You&#39;re lifted from the seat by your new, round, plump butt.<br />
Your legs gain length and widen slightly, giving them an elegant shape.<br />
<br />
Feeling your whole body age, you groan as your body accentuates it&#39;s hourglass shape. You spasm a bit as you feel soft, fat spheres expand outwards. Your new breasts fatten and sag slightly with age, your nipples thickening and darkening as you feel your tits bloat. Suddenly, they burst out of your shirt, their size is huge, bigger than your head, and you moan as your nipples lactate warm, steamy milk onto the table and the walls.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re now in your thirties as your genitalia tingles. You empty your balls cumming all over the floor while your scrotum and testicles retract into your body. You gain a thick, used, warm, hairy mature vagina as your penis becomes a rather large clit. <br />
<br />
With your hands and feet gaining daintiness and wrinkles, you feel your nails gaining expensive manicure, and your toenails get a white coating.<br />
Your throat squirms as your Adam apple vanishes. You coo with a husky, mature voice. <br />
<br />
Your face soon reshapes, your jawline straightens as you gain a slight cleft shin. Your limps pump as they get coated in pink, glossy lipstick.<br />
Your nose becomes straight and thin, your eyes blink as they change into a deep blue color and develop crowfeet around them.<br />
<br />
Your skin softens and loses all it&#39;s hair, before gaining a bronze tan.<br />
You shake your head as silky blonde hair materializes, stylizing itself into the typical bob cut a suburban mom just as yourself would use.<br />
What? You feel dizzy, but soon snap out of it as the fury within your mind takes control of your body.<br />
<br />
You stand up as high heeled sandals form on your dainty, tan feet. Your ass bounces as it gets covered with leopard print panties, before being encased in tight denim jeans that accentuate all your curves.<br />
<br />
A huge, lacy bra holds your massive breasts, while a white tank top forms itself on your body, giving everyone around you a perfect view of your cleavage and those plump mommy breasts.<br />
<br />
Expensive earrings pierce your ears, and your arms and neck are adorned with luxurious bracelets and a necklace.<br />
You feel a huge surge of confidence and a demanding manner as you approach the counter.<br />
&quot;This coffee is cold, everything is made awfully&quot;<br />
You say loudly to the cashier. She&#39;s startled by this.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry ma&#39;am, can you tell me what&#39;s wrong?<br />
You raise your voice, not caring that everybody hears you.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s wrong, that you think you can get away with giving me your old stuff, your mouldy doughnuts and your gross coffee, you should be ashamed of yourself&quot;.<br />
You speak with a loud, commanding noice, and you gesture her like you were scolding your kids.<br />
&quot;No need to raise your voice, ma&#39;am, calm down, we can fix this, if you need a refund you just-&quot;<br />
&quot;No. You gave me a horrible service, you knew about this, you tried to make me pay for this cold, raunchy garbage, I want another order, FREE this time, and I want you FUCKING FIRED.&quot; <br />
The clients look at the counter, some take out their phone and record the whole thing. You argue with the cashier in an even louder voice, and the scene soon escalates into a screaming fit. You know you were right. This cafe gave you an awful service and you wanted them to pay, their abuse towards their clients, innocent working women like you can&#39;t be tolerated. <br />
&quot;We can&#39;t give you anything else, ma&#39;am, you can&#39;t behave like this, please leave&quot;.<br />
Infuriated, you sweep the counter with your arm, making napkins, orders, and other stuff fall to the ground. You stomp your foot as you stare at the cashier with your deep, intimidating blue eyes, and you point at her with your index finger.<br />
&quot;Let me speak to your manager.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After a few hours arguing with the whole staff, and the manager herself, you walk out of the Starbucks with a bag full of pastries and your hand carrying a full coffee cup holder.<br />
You got away with it, of course, you&#39;re a strong woman, not only the respectable CEO of a popular retail store, but also a loving, although strict single mom of three.<br />
<br />
You walk to the parking lot and enter a huge black family van that you&#39;ve never seen before, but that also feels strangely familiar.<br />
You drive comfortably, screaming loudly at drivers and pedestrians that get in the way, as your new identity finally takes a hold of this reality.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re now Karen Kapfelmann, the 42 year old, suburban single mother, and you&#39;re on your way to pick up your 13 year old twin boys Jake and Brandon  from their soccer practice. They&#39;re the top of the class, and today you received the news that they could be picked up by a professional team soon.<br />
Your 16 year old daughter Melissa isn&#39;t doing bad either, she is attending castings for several Netflix shows, those acting lessons and your good genetics are finally giving results.<br />
<br />
Like the proud, loving soccer mom that you are, you&#39;re going to surprise them with some delicious treats.<br />
Sadly, no one else knows you for your important job, or as a kind, caring mother, but rather as the star of the latest trending <br />
YouTube video: &quot;Whiny Karen Starbucks freakout&quot;. For anyone else, you&#39;re just another Karen.</p>
