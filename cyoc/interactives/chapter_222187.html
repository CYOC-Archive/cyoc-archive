<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your thoughts went back to Sam for a few minutes, thinking of the Jock as he strutted his body through the hallway. His physique alone had caused the rest of the hallway to part when he carried himself by. Between him and his buddy Jack, they commanded a sort of subconscious presence, a dominance that caused everyone around them to both notice them, fall into awe of them, and then either get out of their way or do their bidding.<br />
<br />
Sam was the star wide receiver of the high school&#39;s football team. He had taken the team to state his senior year this past fall, and Jack was the team&#39;s star running back. Between the two of them, everyone respected or were terrified of them. Whereas Jack was the complete asshole of the jock clique, Sam was a sort of leader, a confident but quiet man who just told people what to do and they listened. <br />
<br />
You envied that seeming feel of authority, of dominance. Sam didn&#39;t even realize that he had it, he just worked to be a great athlete, but with his body and with his success, had had created a much bigger presence at the school then even he realized. <br />
<br />
As you stood there in the bathroom, staring at yourself in the mirror, you thought for a moment about possessing Jack, after all, that jock had humiliated you time and time again simply for being a non-jock, an outsider to his clique.  But Sam had never directly bullied you, he was just so damn intimidating that you had never wanted to cross him. But that lust for his presence was making you want to take him. &quot;If only I could be him for a day, just see what it&#39;s like to be such a dominant and influential jock,&quot; you told yourself.<br />
<br />
The ring started to warm up on your finger. Looking down at it, you realized that you could use it to will this very wish into being. <br />
<br />
&quot;But how?&quot; you asked yourself. <br />
<br />
The ring seemed to understand your desire because right as you asked the question the bathroom door opened and Sam stepped in. You turned your head and your jaw nearly dropped. Sam turned his broad shoulders toward you and looked back. At first a glance, and then again with annoyance. &quot;What do you want, shithead?&quot; he asked, before stepping into the bathroom and toward a urinal. He walked with his usual, confident swagger toward the urinals, still 10 feet from them, he unzipped his jeans and pushed his hand into his crotch, already feeling to pull his dick out well before he reached the urinal. As he stepped into it, you could tell that he pulled out his monster cock and aimed toward the urinal. A strong splash of piss hit the ceramic.<br />
<br />
Sam shut his eyes, completely ignoring you, and meditated for a moment. You wanted to listen to his thoughts, so you ordered the ring to help you read his mind. Just as you had suspected, he had already forgotten that you were even in the room, he was thinking about his conditioning after school today, and the fact that he wanted to get to benching 300. <br />
<br />
You chuckled to yourself for a moment. Of all the things for anyone to think about, all this jock cared about was getting more swole and showing off to the rest of the team.<br />
<br />
You looked back down at the ring on your hand. This single artifact, this one find that you had discovered, it was able to give you whatever you wanted. And you were ready to make your first real wish. To possess the jock standing a few feet away from you.<br />
<br />
The thought of just being the jock was making you excited, so much so that you could feel your dick starting to push hard against your leg and jeans. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I made up my mind. I will possess him!&quot; you tell through thoughts to the ring, and as you do so, you notice your hand start to fade, star to become more ethereal, it started to become more transparent, like a ghost! But no, it was more than that, it was starting to turn to smoke. &quot;Ahh,&quot; you tell yourself as you direct the smoke of your hand, causing it to fly toward Sam. &quot;I can just force my way right into his body!&quot;<br />
<br />
The urinal flushed. The distraction caused you to form back into your human body once more. <br />
<br />
Sam walked over to the sink next to yours and started to wash his hands. You turned your head again toward him, then down his stocky arms and toward his hands as they scrubbed the soap between them. He carried a hefty amount of thick, blonde hair on them. You figured that he was probably a pretty hairy guy underneath his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you looking at, Fag?!&quot; Sam retorted to you. Then he took his left hand and shoved you backward. &quot;I asked you a question, you piece of shit!&quot; he shouted before stepping toward you again.<br />
<br />
You smirked, Sam had no idea what he was getting himself into.<br />
<br />
When he went to push you once more, you grabbed his left forearm with your left hand. The powers of the ring allowed you to hold his thick physique in your grasp despite the fact that he was so much bigger than you. &quot;What did you call me?&quot; you asked him.<br />
<br />
Sam for the first time started to get worried. His eyes widened as he realized that he wasn&#39;t able to free his arm of your grasp, but also that you were able to hold him in place.<br />
<br />
With your right hand you reached out and grabbed his cheeks, puckering up his lips. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; he said as he realized that you had him completely in your grasp. You pulled his face toward yours until he was only a couple of inches away. Despite being over 50 pounds bigger than you, he could barely move away from your grip. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the dominant one, now, Sam.&quot; you tell him through a form of thought-speak. His eyes widened in horror. &quot;In a few minutes, you&#39;ll be nothing but a husk, I&#39;ll have complete control over you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking for a moment, you figured you would try something you had never done before, to give the jock a taste of you before you took over him. You leaned your lips toward his and gave him a long, deep kiss, massaging your lips against his for a few moments. <br />
<br />
Sam was disgusted with the act but more terrified that you were continuing to hold him into a grip that you were. &quot;You&#39;re mine, Sam, goodbye, motherfucker,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
It was then that you ordered your ring to give you the power to possess him, and as soon as you released your lips, you felt your body turn into your ethereal, smoke-like form once more. Not just your hand this time, but your entire body.<br />
<br />
You felt the weight of your physical clothes fall to the floor and you could feel yourself in your new form as a type of weightless, flyable cloud, an amorphous cloud of vapor. <br />
<br />
You directed yourself into Sam, covering his face and feeling yourself pulled in as Sam took a breath. As you did you felt yourself quickly get swept into the jock&#39;s body. You distilled yourself throughout him, feeling yourself flow into his lungs, then his blood, taking over him from the cellular level outward. After he took the first breath you quickly gained control over his lungs and subsequently pulled yourself into him, further and further integrating yourself into his body until your entire being became completely integrated into him. <br />
<br />
All of your senses quickly fell into line. You took over his vision, hearing, sense of smell and taste, you could feel his body become your own as his own blood circulated you throughout him. When you nestled yourself into his mind you adapted his entire memories, his personality. You adapted to the cocky, confident jock. &quot;Exactly what I always wanted!&quot; you told yourself as you felt his body become your own. Your sense and feeling of strength was amplified 10-fold. The body you now held was a tank of power, of endurance, you could feel the jock&#39;s body as one of pure athleticism. <br />
<br />
But it was now your own.<br />
<br />
You took one final deep breath as you opened your new host&#39;s eyes. &quot;Ahh! Fuck yea!&quot; you whispered to yourself. Looking back at the mirror, you noticed the jock still looked the same as only a few moments before. &quot;Only I&#39;m in control now,&quot; you told yourself, smirking.<br />
<br />
Looking down at the pile of clothes next to you, what were your clothes, you took out your old student ID and wallet and picked up the pile and threw them into the trash can. Looking down at your left finger, you realized that the ring automatically moved with you onto Sam&#39;s body. No, your body. You continued to have possession of and own its powers. <br />
<br />
You strutted yourself back to the mirror and pulled back Sam&#39;s t-shirt, revealing a massive bicep. Flexing for a few moments, you pulled up the front of his shirt and admired your new six pack, crunching them and rolling your finger between the dirty blonde hairs and valleys on the jock&#39;s abs. Relishing into the body that you now owned, you pondered what to do next.</p>
