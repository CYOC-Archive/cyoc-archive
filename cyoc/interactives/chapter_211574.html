<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#120385;&#120420;&#120426;&#120423; &#120392;&#120420;&#120419;&#120425;&#120413;&#120424; &#120417;&#120406;&#120425;&#120410;&#120423;...<br />
<br />
It&#39;s an honest mistake. You were aiming your camera at the driver of this expensive-looking car. You went home that night, thinking you&#39;d done the thing. It&#39;s not your fault the app didn&#39;t show whose face it actually caught. It&#39;s evening and the light from the overhead street light did not illuminate the passenger on the back. You woke up the following day, not as a rich-looking 35-year-old man, but as a brown-haired 10-year-old boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Daniel?&quot; your mom asked. No. She&#39;s not actually your mom. But this kid&#39;s mom. Calling her mom feels awkward but that&#39;s what keeps the charade running. <br />
<br />
&quot;I– I&#39;m fine. Just a little lightheaded, that&#39;s all. You don&#39;t have to worry about me,&quot; you smiled. Your family recently fetched your little brother from his violin class and you are on your way home. <br />
<br />
If you weren&#39;t her child, you&#39;d be attracted to her. Based on what little Daniel knows about her parents, she used to be a famous actress who debuted in a famous movie ten years ago. From that point, she hosted various shows and movies - all seeing great success. That&#39;s when your dad met her. A year later, they conceived a child thus forcing her to end her career early. As for your dad, he&#39;s the youngest son (out of four) of a conglomerate CEO, Charles Cave. You used to hear that name only in the news. He&#39;s an aggressive businessman who controls many famous brands under his conglomerate&#39;s wing. From toothpaste to career agencies, he seeks to drive out competition and establish a monopoly. But despite the endless wealth, your new father avoided the corporate cannibalism he would have with his siblings. He got a hefty sum from grandpa and left promptly out of the family&#39;s reach. Your family now lives comfortably in a seaside residential area. <br />
<br />
Four months in this new body and identity, and it seems you&#39;re fitting quite nicely. Daniel used to be a timid little boy who was afraid of his own shadow. That changed when you took over. You acted a little more mature for your age, and your parents welcomed the changes. If only they knew that their son is now an adult man. Having Daniel&#39;s memories also helped in fitting you in. Not like there&#39;s much to know about him. Daniel&#39;s only exceptional characteristic is his wealthy background. He barely makes an effort in school or anything at all. He does not understand the concept yet, but you could remember seeing your mother consult a doctor about his slowness. When you first excelled in Daniel&#39;s assignments, joy was overflowing from her face. You can&#39;t help but share her happiness as well. Although, it would do her well to not rub your head against her breast. She may see it as motherly, but it feels awkward for you. <br />
<br />
Although… It&#39;s not your original plan to be in this body. Joshua Cave was supposed to be your body. He&#39;s the man of the house and could access this family&#39;s monetary savings. Think of the cars and booze you could buy with that money. But you had to miss your aim and land at this tiny body. What makes it worse is that you&#39;re stuck here until you&#39;re twelve. Despite being rich, your parents are strict when it comes to letting you own a phone. You&#39;re not like other children. You came from a famous family, and people will take advantage of you once they know your real identity on the Internet. Although, you have a laptop and you can still access the &quot;Swap Snap&quot; application there. But your laptop doesn&#39;t have a camera. When you open the app, it just leads you to customer service. <br />
<br />
So… yeah… You&#39;re stuck in this body for two more years. Not like you should be complaining that much. For a kid, you&#39;re already accruing good looks. Your hair is mud-brown and it has bangs that part evenly. You&#39;ve always thought that this is the stereotypical rich kid haircut, the kind of aristocratic brat who bullies the main character in a story. You don&#39;t like it but your mother insists that you keep your hair like this. She used to be a hairdresser before she entered the show business. Aside from the hair, you got bright maroon eyes that somehow look sharper whenever your mature self is in control. When you&#39;re letting Daniel&#39;s attitude take the wheel, it&#39;s rounded and brimming with innocence. Your body is nothing special. Just thin pale limbs that are somehow brimming with endless youthful energy. You could climb monkey bars back and forth without getting tired. You could run laps around your residence villa and never break into heaving gasps. You&#39;d be sweaty of course. And your father seems to like it whenever you&#39;re doing physical activities outside. Daniel doesn&#39;t seem to do it, and he tends to hole up in his room most of the time. <br />
<br />
Lastly, it&#39;s regarding your not-so-special package. It&#39;s more skin than flesh. Peeling back the foreskin won&#39;t let you show the head. It hurts when you force it, so you give up in the end. And you can&#39;t masturbate like you usually do. You&#39;d orgasm but it&#39;s painful and no cum would come out. Despite that annoyance, it allows you to orgasm in succession. But you tend to stop at the second orgasm because this body is too sensitive to such pleasures. You&#39;d lay naked on your bed, catching your breath as your heart is nearly going to explode. You&#39;d wake up on the morrow with your nagging little brother asking why you&#39;re naked. He won&#39;t understand so you lied to him by saying sleeping is much more comfortable this way. <br />
<br />
As for school, your adult experience is doing wonders for Daniel&#39;s academics. You didn&#39;t immediately raise his grades. That would arouse suspicion. You raised it gradually and made sure to let your teachers and tutors see that you were studying. But once you got your first perfect in Science, it never stopped from there. Math, Science, and History, all are easy since you&#39;ve already experienced this before. By the end of the first month, you&#39;ve toppled the top academic brass of your class. You&#39;ve received a mix of scorn and praise from your peers. You thought it would make an improvement to your social cred, but nothing seemed to change in the end. <br />
<br />
Despite becoming a child, everything is going well. You don&#39;t have many responsibilities. You don&#39;t even need to help with chores since you have maids to do that. Although, you did try to help once and your father reprimanded you. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m proud that you&#39;re kind enough to help them,&quot; He said while wiping a non-existent smidge from his square eyeglasses. &quot;But you&#39;re also saying that they are incompetent at their job, and that&#39;s why you&#39;re butting in. I&#39;m already paying them more than their usual wages. You don&#39;t need to meddle further in their jobs. And besides, don&#39;t you have assignments to do?&quot; <br />
<br />
Besides that, you&#39;re enjoying this new life. You eat three times a day, you don&#39;t worry about losing your job or landowners nagging for rent, and you have a family who loves you dearly. In a way, missing the snap of your camera worked well in the end. </p>
