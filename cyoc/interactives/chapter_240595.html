<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Authors Note: I really liked the attention to detail and world building in the previous threads. Not something else I could do on my own by a longshot, and taking many considerations on how many people would react to such drastic changes without resorting to New World Orders of positive or negative note, as well each person&#39;s personal take and coping mechanisms. I&#39;m continuing on from here to take advantage of that effort, but by no means take this as an attempt of solidifying canon from the previous author&#39;s own work. This is my take on another character and idea within the setting so far.)<br />
<br />
Two entities were currently watching camera feeds in what looked to be a security room. The entities themselves looked to be dark-haired, pale-skinned women in tattered security uniforms of some sort, but one was much taller than the other. Or was one much smaller than the other? Either way, one pointed at one of the screens. On it looked to be a hoodlum doing suspicious activity at a chain-link fence. After what sounded like incomprehensible growls and moans and some gestures, it looked like the smaller one was selected to take an action. A name tag on the smaller one&#39;s uniform read as &quot;Michael&quot;. She got up, and immediately hunched over and walked with predatory gait to a large, currently unpowered monitor. With a gesture, the monitor turned on with static on the screen, and she crawled INTO it like it was just an open window with no resistance.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, near the hoodlum, an old crt television flickered on with static despite showing no signs of being plugged in anywhere in the foilage, much less having power access. Out of it crawled Michael, the small, pale-skinned, dark haired woman. The lighting did not go unnoticed by the hoodlum, especially considering how dark the area was before hand. And when she seemed to have his attention, she made threatening gestures along with growling and screeching. Any ounce of composure the hoodlum had was lost at this point as he screamed and ran off in a direction. She eventually got up and continued a predatory gait, along with screeching louder as if to make a point that she was still there and &quot;chasing&quot; the hoodlum. Eventually a hand radio on the breast of the uniform had a sounds coming through, sounding like the tall woman&#39;s from before, and suddenly the posture of Michael changed and she gave a response back, showing no indication she was gonna continue the chase of the hoodlum. <br />
<br />
She never got tired of scaring troublemakers off.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
On the day of the changes, Michael, an overweight 30 something caucasian dude of larger build, was in his apartment watching various horror movies. He was dressed up in a white robe, a long black wig, and some make up for his skin to appear deathly pale. Originally he was going to attend a small Halloween party among fellow security guards with a strong scary monster theme for costumes, especially considering their profession and work environment, but it got cancelled last minute when a higher up didn&#39;t want the possible appearance of slacking. With nowhere to go for the night, Michael decided to watch scary movies specifically themed around the scary ghost woman archetype in his small apartment, which his costume was based off of. <br />
<br />
Now what he was watching wasn&#39;t super specific. Japanese origins, Western Origins, sometimes even Video games he looked at and played. The were the small girls crawling out of wells and TVs. There were the inhuman women who moved in alien ways. Sometimes there were the ones that were more horny bait then actually scary. Some seemed to be ethereal ghosts and spirits, some more fleshy abominations.  Regardless,  they seemed to share a certain look of long black hair, pale skin as well as killing their quarries in brutal ways. He figured his costume, as goofy and low quality as it was and lack of acting talent, was a tribute to them. Then the change came.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice at first as he was half-way asleep when it happened, but he was knocked out of his reverie from screams and other noises going on around his apartment. He was originally going to shrug it off due to nature of Halloween, but his trained guard senses said that even this was too much somehow. He went to get up from his recliner, then that&#39;s when he noticed something was wrong with his body.<br />
<br />
Michael was smarter then he looked, but he was blessed by having a large build which lead to a lot of career decisions in his life and lack of motivation. In other words, he looked like he could do damage if someone picked a fight with him. But he was now swimming in the recliner he bought specifically for his larger size. And quick look at his arms and body below...he looked girly? He had no other lighting at this point other then what came from his TV and his robe covered up much of his body, so once again falling to his guard instincts, he eventually got up from his recliner and move to his full-size closet mirror in his bedroom and turned a light on. What he saw in the reflection took every ounce of willpower not to scream.<br />
<br />
He seemed to be a young girl out of one of the media he was watching earlier. This included the deathly looks and all. She had long black matted hair that was probably straight if it was taken care of, and it almost covered her eyes, and probably did from many angles. Her skin was pale but more like an actual corpse, although she wasn&#39;t sure what a corpse looked like outside of movies. Her robe was much more detailed then the almost-sheet he (or was that she now?) was wearing earlier, being actual nightwear now if moldy and tattered. There was more detail to her looks, but currently the robe was covering most of it. She went to take it off, having no idea the ramifications it would have for later on.<br />
<br />
She looked younger than a teen by far, with later assumptions on examinations putting her at the high single-digit. Her face was a twisted mess, not like some abstract artist&#39;s attempt, but much more then even an actor with special make up could attempt. Her eyes especially were lacking, she didn&#39;t seem to have any, but she didn&#39;t seem to have empty sockets either. Instead there was a sort of perceivable darkness with matching dark veins coming out to her surrounding skin. And speaking of her skin, the corpse theory felt stronger as it wasn&#39;t just sickly pale with veins to match, but she seemed to have scars and what seemed to be opened wounds and injuries, although she didn&#39;t seem to be bleeding and there was no pain from touch, although her sense of touch did seemed to be altered, but she would think about that later. Her hands and feet were also claw-like, with her fingers being almost like talons. <br />
<br />
Other than the robe, it appeared she had no other article of clothing. She didn&#39;t have have the sneakers she had on below the robe before the transformation. She wanted to investigate more, but the ruckus outside her apartment was growing and she was wanting a distraction from what she appeared to be, so she walked to her front door and took a look outside into the hallway.<br />
<br />
It was chaos. There was the expected Halloween costumes of classic scary creatures or pop culture icons, but they all looked like high quality outfits. What really got him was seeing animals, in-human creatures, and sometimes what should&#39;ve been inanimate objects running or using whatever locomotion to get by. One lady dressed up as what Michael guessed to be an elven queen took notice of Michael enough to stop and screamed at what she saw. It started a chain reaction with Michael himself and he screamed... although it was more like a piercing wail that even made himself shiver in fear. That just made the Elven Queen scream harder so he quickly closed his door.<br />
<br />
Did everyone else really transform? He looked down at himself still in disbelief, but the next thought was turn his TV to news to see what was being said if there was this much chaos going on.<br />
<br />
And so the rest was history, and Michael adjusted the best he could to his newly transformed body and its quirks, along with the ramifications of a society dealing with transformations and magic. He swore up and down when he realized he was stuck with his body due to removing the robe, or he tried until he realized he could no longer talk. But as more and more news came in, he realized he could be considered one of the luckier ones considering some of the forms or mental changes. <br />
<br />
At first he was heavily investigated due to the nature of his form, but due to years of training, background checks, and requirements for clearances, and not showing any sign of outright hostility, he was soon left to his own devices other then working out a date to be changed back and some practice with magic-users as it seemed he had some ability.<br />
<br />
Overtime he learned the quirks of his form.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t talk at all. Everything came out as creepy moans, growls, and screeches depending on his voice volume and what he was trying to get across. <br />
He didn&#39;t seem to be alive, yet his body defied various conventions regardless of anatomy and biology. He one time turned his head around, bone cracking sounds and all, but he didn&#39;t feel any particular discomfort from it other then erratic movement. One time he even used the locomotion of a spider, no discomfort at all from his limbs being warped from the attempt. He was thankful that he barely felt any pain, if felt at all. There was especially more then a few incidents where he wasn&#39;t paying attention to his claw-like hands and poke a hole or left a gash on himself somewhere. <br />
His demeanor seemed to match his form if he wasn&#39;t watching himself. He would shuffle around, move in weird sprints if he tried to move faster, and otherwise just seemed to move creepily.<br />
There was also being very young girl in appearance, although this overall took a backseat to the overall appearance of her form.<br />
<br />
Then there was the super natural aspect of his form and the trained magic users helped him to discover if not outright discovering on his own.<br />
<br />
He could move through TV screens or similar as a form of teleportation. He&#39;s not sure the full extent of how this works, especially since he doesn&#39;t seem to be able to access TVs that are far away, but anything he seems aware of or close by he can somehow sense and use.<br />
He could walk on walls, and even ceilings. Although he rarely outright just walked, as his aforementioned creepy movements also affected this. <br />
He was more scary then he seemed to be, especially when he tried to be. This was only noticeable as there was no shortage of people transformed into various scary or brutal monsters, but the magic users sensed he had a sort of aura that became more active when he did try to be more scary, even with a simple &quot;boo!&quot; type action. <br />
He could also &quot;write&quot; on surfaces in some dark, blood-like liquid. This was done on accident when he had a major frustrated moment communicating with another person, and when he pointed somewhere out of anger, the text he wanted appeared on a selected wall. He had to also watch himself when he did this, otherwise the text came out as cryptic messages and it was too slow for more thorough communications.<br />
Whatever he wore, would fit his form well and become tattered or otherwise dilapidated. <br />
<br />
One particular quirk, or lack thereof, that he was glad for is that he didn&#39;t feel any particular need to do evil or haunting things, especially considering what his form was inspired by. He heard of many other transformed prone to violence or other bad activities due to their forms, but somehow that didn&#39;t translate to himself. He didn&#39;t even gain any kid mannerisms if considering apparent age. This helped alot in the long run as time went by. He wondered if he could do any particularly violent or brutal abilties, but both he and the magic-users agreed that it shouldn&#39;t be tried under any circumstance.<br />
<br />
As the chaos died down and connections were reestablished, his boss was glad to to get into contact with him, even if just by texts and e-mails. Security was especially paramount right now and was checking on all his employees, transformed or not. After explaining his situation and some back and forth, Michael&#39;s boss was willing to give him a try for doing security again. And it was a major success. <br />
<br />
Michael had all sorts of training and certifications that would take much money and time to get, so that was already a plus for him. But even as a big, physically intimidating guy, he still had to get into arguments and even brawls once in awhile with trouble makers. But as a scary ghost girl? Most people ran as soon as they saw her. With a combination of a lack of employees and her effectiveness as a trouble deterrent, Michael solidified her career as a security guard again and even got a pay raise out of it. Which suited him just fine as most of it was just sitting in a security room goofing off with some patrolling. She even helped her boss and company with recruiting those similar to herself, including even some other former employees. One of which was a tall woman who had a scary ghost woman vibe similar to her own.<br />
<br />
She had issues being in public, but as the months went on from the change, she got use to her situation and she wasn&#39;t the only scary thing walking out in the open at times. Even with how hard it was for people to act normal with her, especially considering how unnerving her form could be, Michael was natural lone wolf so it suited him just fine to only go out for needs. Many religious types were also outright hostile to seeing him, but he didn&#39;t blame them too hard considering what he himself woke up to see each day in the mirror, especially he he wasn&#39;t watching his mannerisms. <br />
<br />
It was now the middle of January. Michael was still getting use to his body, but he felt like he had most of it figured out and comfortably his own. He had no restoration date, and even if offered he had a sense would be one of the last to be changed back. But the way things were, life is tolerable, if not outright good.</p>
