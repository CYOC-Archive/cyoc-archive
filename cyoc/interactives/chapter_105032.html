<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Say Barb,&quot; began Ryan, listening carefully to the sound of the shower running, confirming Claire was nowhere within her new were hearing distance. &quot;I was wondering...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yesss...&quot; seductively growled his friend over the phone, hoping Ryan was going to suggest a threesome on his own instead of her having to find a way to bring the subject up.<br />
&quot;How much do you know about weretigers and weretigresses?&quot;<br />
It wasn&#39;t the question she was hoping he&#39;d ask, but Barb hid her disappointment as she replied, &quot;As much as the next werewolf, I suppose. What&#39;s up? Claire is all right, isn&#39;t she?&quot;<br />
&quot;And then some!&quot; exclaimed Ryan, thinking back over their night and morning. &quot;I was just wondering, are there any other fur coloring combinations besides the basic orange/black with white arrangement?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I was with one once who favored the Siberian fur pattern. You know, predominantly white,&quot; Barb answered, recalling what a wild night in the woods that was. &quot;Is Claire&#39;s new fursona favoring that?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, which surprises me,&quot; admitted Ryan. &quot;Her fur pattern, and I AM stating this correctly, is black with white stripes.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY!&quot; exclaimed Barbara, now more anxious than ever to have some &quot;private&quot; time with Claire. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of any weretiger, male or female, with that pattern. If you&#39;re worried, maybe you should ask someone higher up the tiger hierarchy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Naw, I&#39;m not worried. Just found it stunning and unique, just like Claire. She even has some highlights in her hair now too. Not as prominent as her fur, but noticeable when the light hits them just right.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now that she&#39;s joined were society, maybe the three of us should get together for a welcoming party,&quot; suggested Barbara. <i>If not more intimate activities afterward.</i><br />
&quot;I&#39;ll run the idea past her, but it won&#39;t be tonight. I have to work, and Claire&#39;s going back to Oregon tomorrow long enough to collect her belongings and start the college transfer red tape on that end. Maybe this weekend?&quot; suggested Ryan.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it,&quot; said Barbara, before hanging up with her fellow werewolf. <i>And maybe Claire might be interested in some girl on girl action tonight while you&#39;re away,</i> she wondered afterward, contemplating the potential fun.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Julie Stovall&#39;s returning health after the surgery to repair the damage done by the brain aneurysm she suffered continued to surprise everyone. It seemed like now that she was over Eric Anderson since her mind reset itself on Arthur Curtis, her healing process had gone into overdrive. While far from totally healed, she was beyond even what a were just a couple of days after the operation should be.<br />
<i>But while it&#39;s good that she&#39;s on the road to physical recovery, we still have to make sure Julie totally recovers mentally and intellectually as well,</i> Doctor Mera Curry reminded herself as she walked into Julie&#39;s hospital room.<br />
&quot;So, how are we doing today?&quot; Mera asked her patient in a cheerful voice once she and Julie were alone, after the attending nurse took away her late breakfast tray.<br />
&quot;Fine, I guess,&quot; began Julie. &quot;From what I&#39;ve been told, I suffered some kind of brain aneurysm, but I didn&#39;t even feel sick before then. Yet I can&#39;t deny the evidence,&quot; she added, reaching up to feel her bandaged covered head.<br />
&quot;Well there are some things, like an aneurysm, that even weres don&#39;t have an immunity to,&quot; began Doctor Curry, as she started asking Julie a series of questions.<br />
A lot of the basic stuff like name, age, address, parents, and other background details Julie knew well. Current events like today&#39;s date she wasn&#39;t expected to, but Julie did accurately guess what month they were still in. However, it was the last question that Doctor Curry was most concerned about.<br />
&quot;What is the very last thing you remember before discovering you were in the hospital?&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean the one back in Moon Lake, or here?&quot; asked Julie in return.<br />
&quot;Moon Lake&#39;s, since they transferred you here for the operation after your condition was diagnosed.&quot;<br />
Julie thought that over for a moment before saying, &quot;I got out of school Friday afternoon and walked home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you walk with anyone?&quot; wondered Mera.<br />
&quot;No. When the weather&#39;s good, I usually walk home for the exercise to keep in shape.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Mera, noting there was no mention of Eric Anderson, who was in a regular habit of walking home with her until his father was killed.<br />
&quot;Do you remember where exactly you were or what you were doing when the aneurysm took its major toll on you?&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean when I passed out and was rushed to the hospital?&quot; Julie asked in return, to which Doctor Curry simply nodded.<br />
Julie Stovall thought long and hard, almost to the point of giving herself a headache, until she admitted, &quot;Sorry. I don&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. No reason why you should have. Just had to ask in case you did.&quot; <i>Absolutely no memory of confronting Eric at his induction ceremony before he became a werewolf,</i> realized Mera, before she continued the examination.<br />
&quot;Now then, I&#39;ve been provided a list of people. Not everyone you might know, for it&#39;s quite varied to purposely test your memory, so if there is one you don&#39;t have any knowledge of, don&#39;t be ashamed to say so because we intentionally put some people we know you don&#39;t know in it as well. Ready?&quot;<br />
Julie said yes and then Mera began reading the names individually.<br />
Family, friends, teachers, neighbors, and other people in and around Moon Lake Julie knew; as well as a few extras like former presidents and celebrities past and present. There were even a few authors and musicians thrown into the mix as well.<br />
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re reciting a phone book out of order,&quot; quipped Julie. &quot;But are we almost done? I&#39;m starting to feel tired again.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable. Your body has gone through a traumatic event and you do need to rest and recover. Just a couple of more and we&#39;ll be done,&quot; promised Doctor Curry. While she continued to read names, she secretly studied Julie more closely than before because of the last two names approaching.<br />
&quot;Eric Anderson,&quot; said Mera.<br />
&quot;Sorry. I don&#39;t know anyone by that name,&quot; replied Julie Stovall, as calmly as if reciting a weather report.<br />
&quot;Okay, no problem. Last one, then you can take that nap,&quot; promised Mera. &quot;Arthur Curtis.&quot;<br />
Doctor Curry watched as Julie&#39;s eyes briefly changed color from deep sea blue to misty sea green at the mention of the young man&#39;s name as she responded. The mention of her potential new suitor was the only time the were-mermaid&#39;s eyes changed color at all, indicating the love at first sight/soul mate &quot;system&quot; (for lack of a better term) that were-mers had apparently really did reset itself from Eric to Arthur.<br />
&quot;Okay. That&#39;s it for now. You rest, and I&#39;ll see you sometime either later this afternoon or this evening,&quot; said Mera with a reassuring smile before walking out of Julie Stovall&#39;s hospital room and thinking about the interesting conference she would be having later with Doctors Tachibana and Twist.</p>
