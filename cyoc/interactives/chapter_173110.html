<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edward Lawton the Third lived his life according to a routine.  He woke promptly at 7 a.m. each day, ate breakfast while reading his paper (he preferred print, even though it was rapidly falling in popularity).  He would shower, shave, and dress, then engage in a conference call with his financial advisors on the way to his office building.  There was a 10 a.m. staff meeting with the Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents of his company, then a private meeting with one of the department heads- he hated micromanagement, but he felt that it was important to know what each branch of his business was doing by talking to someone who was doing the real work- the V.P.&#39;s were competent leaders, but they weren&#39;t actually in the trenches.<br />
<br />
Then a business luncheon, a walk in the park, a video conference with the Hong Kong office, and then he&#39;d be at the club for an early dinner.  After hobnobbing with his peers for a few hours, he was ready to head home, where he&#39;d unwind by watching a classic movie before bed, promptly at 10 p.m..  Eight hours of sleep was for worker bees, old men who had made their fortunes could afford to sleep an extra hour.<br />
<br />
There was no time for romance; while he still had some years left in his life, after his last divorce, he was done with such things.  It didn&#39;t help that he was still attracted to younger women, and at his age, not only was it scandalous to date a girl half his age, what girl would be interested in him, and not his wealth?<br />
<br />
He had no children, which meant that when he died, his money would go to various charitable concerns.  His company certainly didn&#39;t need it, as he was quietly one of the wealthiest men in the world, one of those nameless billionaires most people had never heard of.<br />
<br />
Today he had deviated from his pattern, much to his annoyance.  The strange new pandemic that was spreading across the nation had forced him to hold an emergency staff meeting.  Scientists had yet to determine the vectors for this new illness, or come up with any way to halt it&#39;s progress.  It had apparently started in the city, and quickly spread to the entire female population.<br />
<br />
Edward had always believed in hiring the best person to do a job, male or female, and paid them accordingly.  As a result, a high percentage of his employees were women.  About a third seemed unchanged, or at the least, hadn&#39;t reported any changes.  Another third had become prettier and more petite- that didn&#39;t really affect their performance, though it did distract his employees.<br />
<br />
The final third, however, had become younger.  Edward chuckled at the irony- as wealthy and powerful as he was, he&#39;d have happily paid any amount of money to gain some extra years of life.  But instead, the fountain of youth came in the form of a plague- and one that seemed to only affect women.<br />
<br />
With some of his high level management staff having become supermodels and teen girls, the company was in chaos.  The impact this had on stock prices could not be underestimated either.<br />
<br />
Even though no one&#39;s knowledge or abilities had been affected, a lot less work was getting done around the office, as the female employees were constantly distracted for various reasons.  But there was nothing that could be done- it wasn&#39;t like he was going to fire anyone over this.  <br />
<br />
If COVID hadn&#39;t killed his business, they&#39;d survive this too.  They&#39;d just have to tighten their belts a little.<br />
<br />
He was in a private meeting now, with one of his R&D heads, Charlotte Grace.  Charlotte had been with the company ever since college, and a few weeks ago, she&#39;d been a handsome woman of 43, with short brown hair and grey eyes.<br />
<br />
Today, she looked just shy of 13.  Her hair was longer and glossier, and she was tiny and adorably cute.  She wore a sundress under an oversized labcoat, and her ID badge had yet to be updated.  <br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying, Mr. Lawton, I assure you my ability to perform my duties hasn&#39;t been affected.  I&#39;d like to go back to work as soon as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward leaned back and steepled his hands.  &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t need any time off?  You have a teenaged daughter, as I recall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte sighed.  &quot;Yes, she&#39;s a bit of a handful right now, since I look younger than she does.  And she&#39;s a lot taller- so there has a been a shift in the dynamic of our relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s part of the problem.  I&#39;ve always relied on your brilliant mind, Charlotte.  I have no doubt you can continue to work for the company, but your ability to be taken seriously as an authority figure has suffered from your affliction.  It might be easier to work remotely for now, and take the time to repair your relationship with your daughter.  Your pay and benefits won&#39;t be affected.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte nodded.  &quot;I suppose that&#39;s for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward rose from his desk.  &quot;I know this has been hard on you, Charlotte.  But you&#39;ve been a valuable employee, and I want what&#39;s best for you.  This is the part where, in the old days, I&#39;d put my hand on your shoulder, but sensitivity guidelines prevent that.&quot;  He grinned at his joke.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I...wouldn&#39;t mind, Sir.&quot;  The poor girl&#39;s voice sounded so young.<br />
<br />
He walked to her side and squeezed her shoulder gently for support.  She smiled up at him.  He coughed.  &quot;It&#39;s taking a lot of willpower not to ruffle your hair, Charlotte.  I imagine being treated like a child is the last thing you want right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.  &quot;But...if you did, I wouldn&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
He chuckled and ruffled her hair gently.  &quot;If you need anything, you have my private number.&quot;<br />
<br />
She beamed at him and he showed her out.<br />
<br />
&#39;What a strange world we live in.&#39;, he thought.</p>
