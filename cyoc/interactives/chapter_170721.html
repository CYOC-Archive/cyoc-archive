<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was unsure what to do at first. He wanted to get rid of Dustin, but had so much possibilities to deal with him. <br />
It wasn´t until half an hour of thinking that he found a way he liked. Dustin would be useful to others and be able to feel what happened, but could do nothing. And it would happen slowly, Ty would make sure of that. Grinning broadly, Ty made himself invisible and teleport over to Dustin´s room to watch the changes he made silently. He also added a wish that the door was locked and the room soundproof. It wouldn´t do if Dustin got away or someone heard him screaming. <br />
To Dustin all of the day had been crazy. He still had to find a way to get his body back as it was, and it seemed as if Ty was guilty of doing this to him. But why didn´t his parents notice, they even said it was normal. Was that also Ty&#39;s doing? Would he need to be on good terms with Ty to get his body back?<br />
He was too deep in thought to notice what happened inside his room at first. Ty didn´t only change Dustin, but also his room. While Ty watched, the shelf above Dustin´s desk and computer, filled with various game cases, changed first. The game disks and cases slowly crumbled on the shelf, leaving only sand laying on it. When it was empty beside the sand, the shelf itself followed suit.<br />
Dustin got startled at the sound of the mass of sand falling down onto his desk. While at first only bits had trickled down, when the shelf gave way it all rushed down in one go. He looked around, fearing what could have happened, only to see his desk and computer covered in sand, and the shelf above missing. “What the…? Where does that sand come from?”<br />
While both Dustin and the invisible Ty watched, the computer was next to crumble down, followed by Dustin´s desk. Dustin´s eyes widened in horror at seeing everything turn to sand. He had laid on his bed, but now he had jumped up and moved to the sand to look over it. He didn´t understand why this was happening.<br />
Slowly, the rest of Dustin´s belongings started to crumble as well. His wardrobe fell apart after the clothes inside already had turned into sand. Posters and pictures around his walls disintegrated into more sand, his desk chair toppled over as it fell apart in on swift motion. The last to crumble was Dustin´s bed, which tool only a minute, even if to the horrified Dustin in felt like hours.<br />
“I have to get out of here.” Thought Dustin and run towards the door. Ty willed for everything that belonged to Dustin to appear in the room only to crumble as well. Dustin saw from the corner of his eyes as more clothes appeared and collapsed in a heap of sand in the center of his room. His school bag, various books, old toys from the attic, everything that belonged to him filled the room with more and more sand.<br />
Lastly, the clothes Dustin was wearing fell apart around him, leaving him naked, by now banging the door that didn´t bulge, screaming for help.<br />
Ty grinned when he made his next wish, this time dealing with Dustin himself. He whispered, but Dustin could hear him: “Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. But in your case, it´s more like sand to sand.” Followed by a little, but cruel laugh.<br />
“Ty, please stop.” Dustin begged, looking around his sand filled room, but couldn´t see the invisible Ty standing right behind him. He continued to bang the door, only for suddenly smashing his own fist on it, leaving a chunk of sand falling down, breaking on the ground. Now, Dustin´s arm ended in a stump, and it slowly got shorter as more of it crumbled to sand as well.<br />
Dustin screamed in full panic, watching as more and more of his right arm vanished. With his focus on his right arm, he barely noticed when his left hand followed its counterparts’ example to fall apart when his right elbow was reached. In under a minute, Dustin had lost both arms up to his shoulders, a new heap of sand around his feet. <br />
They were the next to slowly crumble, and Dustin noticed to his horror that he was shrinking slowly. It took a bit for him to realize that his feet and legs were now crumbling as well. “Please Ty, stop this, whatever it is.” He pleaded, at least to himself, to his empty room. But as an answer he could only hear more of Ty´s cruel laughter, and Ty faded into view before him, looking down at him. “No” was his simple answer.<br />
By now Dustin´s legs were gone, followed by his genitals and his lower torso. Dustin had tears in his eyes as he watched Ty grow in front of him. When only his head remained on top of the heap of sand, Ty petted Dustin´s head in mock sympathy. “Poor little Dustin, everything you owned, including your body, is now nothing more than sand. But don´t worry, it´s not over. You will be able to feel everything that happened to your crumbled body later. To you, it will feel as if nothing has changed, you will feel if someone works with the sand you have become as if they work with a part of your body. Hahaha” Ty laughed again, and watched as Dustin´s head started to crumble as well.<br />
First was Dustin´s hair, simply sliding down his head. Next his ears and nose fell apart, leaving his head look like a ball. Dustin tried to speak a last time, but as his throat was already sand, nothing came out of his mouth. But while it was open Ty could watch Dustin´s tongue and teeth turning into sand. Half a minute later the last of the outside of Dustin´s head, his eyes, crumbled into balls of sand that broke apart when touching down on the rest of the sand.<br />
Ty took the last part of Dustin into his hands. He had made sure Dustin´s brain wouldn´t fall apart like the rest, and now it rested on his hands. Ty made sure the brain remained as one, otherwise maybe Dustin´s consciousness would fade over time. This was it would be trapped intact, leaving Dustin to suffer longer. But Ty had no use for a stone of that size, and it wouldn´t do to keep it separate from the rest. So, Ty made the brain shrink to the size of a single grain of sand while it kept his whole functionality. The single grain of sand was then dropped into the heap of his body.<br />
Dustin was fully aware of his body, of each part of it. He was still able to use each of his senses. Unbeknownst to him Ty made sure each little grain of sand that had been his body could do so. His vision was split into millions of little points, he could smell and taste his own, now mostly faded, body odor, as he had been sweating while he changed.<br />
“Now, a room full of sand isn´t useful, but that playground down the street could use some new sand, don´t you think? I will make sure that not a single grain of your body will leave the sandbox on it, so enjoy all the little kids playing with you, sand boy.” Ty said, laughing. Then he wished exactly that, adding that nobody remembered Dustin but him. Suddenly, the room was completely empty beside Ty standing there. <br />
Dustin felt a sudden weightlessness blow through him, before he felt pressed from all sides. While all the sand that had been Dustin´s things had transported with him, everything had mixed, and now, in the sandbox on the playground, most laid on top of Dustin. And with Ty´s extra wishes came his entrapment in this stupid sandbox.<br />
Over time Dustin was played with many times, but never a single grain of sand left the box, it just fell back inside when whoever carried it left the borders of the box. What clearly disgusted Dustin was the first time a cat made his business inside him and buried it. Dustin could smell and taste it clearly. And it slowly crumbled into sand as well, leaving him to notice it even more and longer.</p>
