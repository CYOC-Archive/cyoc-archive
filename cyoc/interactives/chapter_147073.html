<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Another faction of the Athenaeum.  And a choice is presented.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A strange procession of chanting noises rattles on outside Nix&#39;s door.  The sound of chains rattling and dark wispers of the occult passing by.  Nix hears this and seems to recognize the culprits.  &quot;Those damn followers of lubricus, don&#39;t they understand they dangers they cause by being so loud in the Athenaeum.&quot;  The kobold says with a scowl before turning to Isaac.  &quot;They belong to a misguided offshoot of the scribes, their leader read a tomb of forbidden knowledge believed to contain a recipe to create raw magic.  They believe if they can successfully brew the concoction they can achieve divinity or some other such nonsense.&quot;  Nix sounded as if he regarded the cult like chanting  as if they were an out of tune band.<br />
<br />
Isaac stands near the door, his brow furrowed in fear and confusion as more passed by the door.  &quot;Are they a threat to us Nix?  Perhaps they know where Illvir is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kobold hops off his desk-stool before approaching the door to listen more clearly.  &quot;Even their chanting is all wrong, they practically slur their words and gurgle out their omens.&quot;  Nix said with a disapproving tone.  &quot;Their main threat is how loud they are being near us, I wouldn&#39;t be too worried about the followers themselves though.  They tend to pass by every so often to try cooking up the recipe that&#39;s been burned into the leaders mind.  They must do it a few chambers down but i&#39;ve never ventured that way myself.&quot;  The kobold focused as he contemplated the situation.  &quot;Actually Isaac, i&#39;ll tell you a few more secrets about this place on one condition.  While i&#39;m sure those lubricus fools haven&#39;t got anything to show for all their work it could prove helpful if you were to scout out what exactly it is they are doing so close to my study.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac sighed this place was full of secrets and Nix wasn&#39;t giving many of them up to him for free now was he.  &quot;So I just scout around their chamber and bring back anything of interest?  It&#39;s dangerous out there though and what if they spot me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nix chuckled slightly as he replied.  &quot;Well it&#39;s dangerous sure, but your getting me some valuable data that could prove useful.  Isn&#39;t the pursuit of knowledge a reward in itself?&quot;  The kobold asked sarcastically.  &quot;But yes i&#39;ll make sure your rewarded with information for your trouble.  In regards to your safety your body seems to be quite sturdy and as long as your as quiet as you can be you should be safe enough.  The followers should all be a bunch of weak chemistry nerds so I doubt they would be very threatening to you anyways.&quot;  Nix says giving Isaac&#39;s strong chest a pat for emphasis, the kobold&#39;s hands quickly starting to wander lower as he lewdly gave Isaac&#39;s package a grope.  &quot;Besides you might find clues on this Illvir&#39;s whereabouts, i&#39;m sure these two massive manhood&#39;s of yours are eager to reunite with the spawn you dominated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac was conflicted and the slow gentle claws jerking him off wasn&#39;t helping him clear his mind.  On the one hand Nix was right Isaac did want to find Illvir, *his* spawn.  Maybe Isaac was starting to see him as little more than a pet than he dominated, it both scared him and turned him on to think of his friend this way.  &quot;Ok i&#39;ll go and traverse the dark, hopefully it&#39;s worth the risk.&quot;  Isaac said as he batted the hungry kobold&#39;s mouth away from his cocks.<br />
<br />
Nix waved goodbye as Isaac slipped out after the last wave of chants passed.  &quot;He should be able to follow their chants as they lead him right to whatever prize it is they have been working on.&quot;  Nix said to himself to assure his feelings that he made the right call.  His tongue slurping up a little bit of Isaac&#39;s pre that dripped out onto his muzzle as his eyes grew wide.  &quot;Such feelings, such arcane power, i&#39;ll have to document this.&quot;  The hyperactive kobold chittered as he bounced over to his desk to scribble more notes down.<br />
<br />
Isaac meanwhile slipped back out into the dark, the dim light enough to see as he followed the chants down the hall.  Staying just out of sight of the procession of hooded figures chanting as they headed towards the occult chamber their ritual must take place in.  Isaac&#39;s body while slimmer was hardly built for stealth, loud feet scraping against the dusty ground as he tailed them.  If they were not so pre-occupied with their own chanting the six or so cult members may have noticed him.  After following down several rooms Isaac spotted the robed figures starting to enter a large chamber with a soft green glow spilling out into the hallway.  As he moved closer to the windows that lined the room Isaac noticed the strange aura that pervaded the chamber.<br />
<br />
Even before he poked his head up to the window to take a peek Isaac could smell the distinct musk of sex and corruption flowing out of the room.  The followers of lubricus all surrounding a shallow basin in the center of the room, a gently glowing green vial lay placed in it.  None of the cultist&#39;s even removed their robes as the chanting stopped, only to be replaced by the sound of wet moans as the followers began to milk their cocks.  Claws, paws, and hands working over their dicks as they pointed them towards the basin with the vial.  Isaac could only watch in amazement as the room devolved into horny self pleasure.  Their leader stood among them, the only one to continue chanting the strange words even as he too beat himself off, his robe unable to fully conceal what was a ballsack that might even have Isaac beat.  The being clearly full of corruption as his unnaturally huge sack oozed a constant stream of pre-come into the waiting pool.<br />
<br />
Isaac could only watch in fascination from the window unsure if he should intervene to stop whatever corrupt magic was at play here.  Right before he could make up his mind however another blast of earthy musk hit him and he slumped down unable to control himself.  He told himself he could deal with this problem later, right now he had two big dripping problems of his own to deal with.  Isaac quickly lost himself to the pleasure, his arms stroking his twin manhoods with gusto.  His own musk starting to pervade the hallway he hid in as he bucked his hips into his waiting hands.  Almost forgetting what he was there to do and the dangers of the Athenaeum in the process.  It didn&#39;t take long before Isaac began panting and moaning, edging himself towards his climax.  Volume of his exploits constantly increasing before he let out a loud half moan half growl of pleasure as Isaac almost hit his peak.<br />
<br />
Voices from inside grew worried as they heard something akin to a monster outside.  Several cultist&#39;s had begun fleeing in worry, their own spent cocks dripping as they fled down the opposite hall.  The leader shouting in dismay as their ritual was disrupted and the green glow of the room flickered.<br />
<br />
The sound of footsteps shocked Isaac back to the present as he reluctantly stood up to check on the room, his unspent cocks aching for him to continue despite everything.  Peeking over the window Isaac could see that even the leader was turning to flee after his followers left him.  &quot;We were so close damnit!&quot;  The creature shouted as he ran out chasing after the others.  Isaac could see the basin was almost full of their combined spunk as the green goo in the vial pulsed with power.<br />
<br />
Now alone Isaac entered the musky room to look for anything of value, his twin cocks refusing to go down as the scent was more concentrated inside.  His eyes continued to be drawn towards the basin however, whatever was in that green vial must be important to them.  Stepping closer his mind drifted as his eyes were lost in the opaque fluid stuck inside, there must be an immense amount of concentrated power inside that artifact.  Power that could benefit Isaac, or even give him greater pleasure...<br />
<br />
His eyes clouded over as Isaac reached towards the vial, drops of his own pre-come sliding down and adding themselves to the pool as he did so.  In his haze he couldn&#39;t tell that the contents inside the glass container pulsed with a burst of energy each time.  Isaac picked up the artifact and held it in his hands considering what to do with it.  He could bring it back to Nix who might have a use for it, keep it safe for now inside him, or... maybe even drink it to gain whatever power he could.  His choker glowed at that last thought, but before he could decide Isaac heard a strange sound from down the hall.  Worry and panic started to flow through him, had all the commotion and noise down here attracted strangers, or worse dangerous guardians of the Athenaeum.<br />
<br />
Isaac needed to act fast.</p>
