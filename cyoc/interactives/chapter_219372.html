<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What the in the nine circles of hell is this,” Baal examining the small box that Enoch handed him. Both currently trekking along a crooked path that runs parallel to the river Styx.<br />
“It’s an insurance policy,” Enoch answering flatly; examining the map as they walk along the desolate landscape. “I only hope we don’t need to use it or it actually works,” Enoch adding.<br />
“What does it do,” Baal pocketing the object on a rucksack slung across his shoulders.<br />
“It can capture and contain a lesser chaos being,” Enoch looking serious.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Baal swearing; not liking this bit of news. Baal wanted to check the wards in hell on a hunch with the Archangel Michael; yet Michael had to return to heaven with Penemue and a critically wounded human turned demon Pava. So when Enoch showed up after Michael portaled out to Purgatory and is most likely in haven by now, Baal was nonplused that Enoch decided to tag along. Baal didn’t hate the first son of Lucifer. Far from it; Baal respected the wolf-taur demon. He was the only Morningstar apart from Lucifer who would selflessly put his life on the line to save all of hell. The routing of the Iron Knight when they besieged Dis help cement that respect. Yet it bristled Baal’s wings that the carefree demon decided to be the leader of this foray. Baal really had no reason to refuse, as Enoch explain what they were looking for and he claimed he knew how to fix it once they find it.<br />
<br />
“And if the box fails to capture the chaos being,” Baal lighting up another cigar.<br />
“Then plan B,” Enoch patting the blade he had secured across his human-like abdomen that transitions into his lower wolf body.  “It’s father’s old weapon,” Enoch grinning as he stops; “we arrived at the first Ward to check.”<br />
“FUCK me sideways,” Baal chocking on the smoke from his cigar; “Light-bringer? I thought that blade was lost when Lucifer and Jehovah banished Tiamat!”<br />
“Found it,” Enoch responding as he uses his fore-paws to clear away the dirt from a mound of stones.<br />
“Where,” Baal asking; “Were did you find for father’s sword.”<br />
“Sorry I was referring to the ward,” Enoch looking at Baal; “Humans found the sword in and archeology excavation. How I got a hold of it,” Enoch looking at the ward closely; “is a story for another day.”<br />
<br />
************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Beelzebub seethed after his talk with Lucifer. His plans for the Iron Knights undone yet again by others; the vile man headed to his private chamber as fast as his centipede body could take him. Staring at the sigil he used earlier to summon his chaos thrall to kill Pava. Not amused that the creature failed that and the possibility that the worthless demon might survive if God can intervene; Beelzebub decided to take no chances with this next task.<br />
“Kill Enoch Morningstar,” Beelzebub commanding the black shapeless mass; “as well as anyone else with him. And make sure they are dead before you come back,” Beelzebub screaming at the last.<br />
Watching the creature leave,” Beelzebub leaves the chamber; “Now to re-disguise the Iron Knights again.” Beelzebub muttering, “Once they serve their purpose; I’ll have them killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Lucifer was in his private office finishing the last of the coffee Enoch made earlier. Thinking of the issues that are currently going on; he was thankful the Lilith took the responsibility of co-ordinating and planning a triple wedding to take place in purgatory in few days. Getting up he heads to his liquor cabinet determined to help him sort his thoughts with something stronger than caffine. He failed to notice a portal of holy light appear behind him and stepping through was Jehovah.<br />
“Coffee and liquor is never a good combination,” Jehovah speaking up.<br />
<br />
“You better have a dam good reason for being here,” Lucifer turning around to see his old friend.<br />
“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t important,” Jehovah sitting down; “I’ll take a brandy if you’re pouring.”<br />
“By all that is unholy,” as Lucifer grabs two glasses and his brandy; “If my lord chamberlain or a messenger barge in, do you realize what this impromptu meeting will cause?”<br />
“A big stink in your court,” Jehovah chuckling as he accepts the glass of brandy.<br />
“And in yours,” Lucifer sitting on the sofa; “I don’t need this right now.” Lucifer downing his drink in one gulp.<br />
“I take it Enoch told you about the wards,” Jehovah sipping his drink.<br />
“Oh this get fucking better,” Lucifer sounding exasperated; he pours himself another drink as God tells him what he suspects is going on.<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“How long will this take,” Baal asking Enoch as he keeps an eye out for trouble. Getting bored as Enoch is muttering and altering what is clearly an addition to a ward being the sigil of Lucifer and Jehovah.<br />
“Not much longer,” Enoch answering; “I calculated that this ward and the one tucked in Dis is all that is need to correct.” Enoch pausing to watch the ward glow bright and Beelzebub’s tampering disappear. “The rest will correct themselves afterwards,” Enoch getting up; “why you ask?”<br />
“Because I think we have company,” Baal getting his sword ready and pulling out the box that was given to him.<br />
<br />
Enoch turns around to see a formless cloud of darkness rapidly approach.<br />
“Quickly Baal,” Enoch ready his father’s sword; “throw the box that the creature!”<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it,” Lucifer sounding defeated; “Beelzebub is my friend. My closest confidant.”<br />
“And he has been playing you from the beginning,” Jehovah sitting next to Lucifer on the sofa and comforting him. “Think far back,” Jehovah speaking; “where was he when we faced Tiamat?”<br />
Lucifer didn’t answer.<br />
“Where was he when we made the wards to ensure that chaos cannot set foot in the three realms we created,” Jehovah asking; “where was Beelzebub when you started the revolt.”<br />
Lucifer couldn’t answer. “But the revolt was his ideal,” Lucifer answering meekly.<br />
“I can’t help you answer the question involving Tiamat,” Jehovah getting up; “As for the wards, I suspect Beelzebub was exploring the chaos magic we all agreed to ban. And before the schism,” Jehovah grabbing the brandy and putting it away; “Kushiel spied Beelzebub poisoning your mind with the ideal of a coup-de-tate. I’m sorry for keeping the last part from you,” Jehovah sitting back down; “but you did advocated the concept of free will when we created humanity.”<br />
“That was Beelzebub,” Lucifer nearly at tears; “by the darkness, I’ve been a fool.”<br />
“No,” Jehovah comforting his old friend; “you were playing checkers, while everyone else was playing chess.”<br />
<br />
Jehovah getting up, “I have to return to heaven. There is a young demon that needs help, referring to Pava.”<br />
“Yes,” Lucifer trying to dry his eyes; “and I have an old friend to arrest.”<br />
“I wouldn’t worry about that,” Jehovah opening up a portal; “Beelzebub overextended himself. Those Iron Knights he has been hiding are about to kill him per Kushiel’s machinations.”<br />
“What,” Lucifer broken out of his funk; “How do you know?”<br />
Jehovah chuckles, “I’m god. Nothing is supposed to escape me. But in all seriousness,” Jehovah’s smile fading as he steps through his portal; “I have birds that keep me apprised of what goes on in my court at all times.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer watched as Jehovah’s portal close as his friend lets out one more bit of information.<br />
“End the lockdown. Your son Enoch is on his way back from his task and he has a wounded Baal slung over him. Talk to him about  what he was doing on earth. Tell him I gave him permission to reveal the whole story. And Kushiel is about to relieve you of your Iron knight problem by taking them once Beelzebub is dead.”<br />
<br />
*************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
“The box didn’t work,” Baal swearing as his blade strikes the formless creature. The creature unfazed with the attack, strikes back at Baal, causing the cigar chomping demon to fall to the ground.<br />
Enoch glares as he wields Light-bringer. The blackened metal blade begins to warm as a brilliant kaleidoscope of light and color imbues and envelops Enoch. With a battle cry to make the dead pause in fear, Enoch charges as he rush towards the creature. Its tendrils of smoke, striking the armor of light surrounding him as the blade bites deeply into the formless being. A low and unearthly howl permeates from the creature as it shudders and flails. Enoch not taking any chances strikes with the sword a second time; cleaving the creature in half and silencing its death rattle.<br />
<br />
Enoch watches as the darkness dissipates before sheathing Light-bringer. He quickly heads to where Baal lays. Seeing he is still breathing; Enoch lifts him up and slings Baal across his back like a nightmare steed being saddled to be broken in.<br />
“You need to lose some weight you fat pig,” Enoch shifting his stance on his four legs. Opening a portal to a healing temple in Dis; Enoch steps through determined to drop Baal of and finish fixing the wards of Hell.</p>
