<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Can I go?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Will suddenly became really uncomfortable. A hand ran behind his neck, rubbing it. &quot;I don&#39;t know man...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t they looking for more information? I&#39;ve been friends with Ethan for years. Maybe I can help out,&quot; I offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re trying to capture your friend,&quot; Will said. &quot;And the types of studying they plan to do won&#39;t be as fun as you think they are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; I pushed my finger into his chest, &quot;that&#39;s more of a reason for me to check it out. Take me with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will let out a sigh. &quot;Fine... But I&#39;ll have to figure a few things out first.&quot; I nodded and wrote in my notebook. &#39;It&#39;ll be completely fine and no issue to bring me along.&#39; Will&#39;s dower attitude quickly shifted as he sent out a text. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said. &quot;Looks like everything&#39;s fine. Come on.&quot; Before I knew it, I was over his shoulder again as he sprinted for the parking garage. As unnecessary as it was, I couldn&#39;t help but find it a bit fun. Somehow the notebook seemed to be shifting things in ways that I wanted but didn&#39;t even fully acknowledge. <br />
<br />
He set me down next to his big black truck and opened the passenger door for me. I had to climb up into it. I suddenly remembered he&#39;d had a car earlier, but with how big Will was, there was no way he could properly fit into one of those. Even the truck seemed to be a bit too small for him as he had to have the seat all the way back and filled the driver&#39;s seat completely. Where I felt like I could fit another me and a half in the seat, he almost looked cramped.<br />
<br />
Before Will could start driving, he had to put on some sunglasses and adjust the radio. He looked down at me with a smile. &quot;Ready?&quot; I nodded. &quot;Alright!&quot; he spun out of the college&#39;s parking garage faster than I&#39;d ever seen. I had to hold onto the door for dear life as he took turns faster than I thought were even possible. Will only laughed as my heart rate rose even more. I could barely even concentrate on where we were going. Left. Right. Left. Left. Right. We were in the city, but I&#39;d never been down any of these streets. There was barely anything even on them. Then he stopped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Will said proudly as he stepped out of the truck. I felt like I was shaking as he rounded the vehicle and opened the door for me. He helped me down. That only confirmed that I was still shaking. My body naturally leaned onto his for support. He looked forward and led me to the glass door. <br />
<br />
The whole place was huge. The building looked like it had to go up at least 25 stories. And the lobby was completely made of polished marble. Light reflected off the shiny surface from the wall of windows lining the front door. &#39;Did I make all this by saying Ethan was a werewolf?&#39; I wondered. &#39;An entire department building for containing or studying supernatural creatures now exited with hundreds if not thousands of employees. Or had they been here all along?&#39; The question hung in my mind. My hand naturally gripped my notebook tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;This way,&quot; Will said as he flashed his badge at the security desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I--?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Will pushed me through. &quot;We&#39;ve got everything settled upstairs.&quot; He took me to the elevator and pushed the button for floor 15. I stared at the roll of buttons. 86 was the highest one. I stared at it in disbelief. There was no way this building went up that high. I looked to Will, but his eyes were planted on the elevator doors. When they dinged, his hand reached behind my back and pushed me off. &quot;This way.&quot; He continued marching through the building, passing all the cubicles without even looking over at them. When my eyes would trail off, he&#39;d give me a light tap on the back.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I was nervous. I&#39;d never been in a situation like this before. Just feeling the tension from Will was rubbing off onto me. I did my best to face forward until we headed into a conference room. There were two guards on either side of the door. They relaxed their legs, but still held their arms behind their backs. &quot;Afternoon Agent Black. We&#39;ve been expecting you,&quot; one of them said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Will Director Dover be here,&quot; Will asked. His speech became very formal.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s classified sir,&quot; the agent said.<br />
<br />
Will&#39;s grip tightened. &quot;I&#39;m the one who is in direct contact with the subject. I believe that should give me enough clearance to know what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Orders sir,&quot; the other agent said without missing a beat. &quot;Only the target is allowed into the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Target--!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two security agent&#39;s hands went to their guns. Will grit his teeth. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
Even if he could see through the brave face I put on, he nodded. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll be right here though. If you need anything--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; I tried assuring him. He nodded again. The frown still planted on his face. But I smiled back. Then headed for the door. The two security guards stepped to the side and the door opened. I went inside. A long table was in the center of the room with several rolling chairs on both sides of it. Even though there were windows, they all seemed to be blacked out and I wasn&#39;t able to properly see outside. A bit of anxiety took over. But I tried to maintain my bravery. I couldn&#39;t let Will think that I was upset. Not to mention, I had a notebook that could bend all reality to my wishes.<br />
<br />
I took my seat, furthest from the door, but still facing it. One of the guards had followed me in and stood next to it. He was at perfect attention, only facing forward and only had an occasional glance whenever I made a movement. Seeing me pull out my notebook and pencil, he went back to staring forward. It was impossible to know what he was thinking about. Anything could have been going on in his mind. Or maybe it was nothing at all. Regardless, I was going to have at least a bit of fun. <br />
<br />
&#39;The man in the room with me will grow 1% bigger every few seconds. It will continue until all of his clothes rip from his body, and no one will notice anything different. He will only feel the slight discomfort but can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s coming from.&#39;<br />
<br />
His eyes glanced over to me for a second when I closed my notebook again. A bit of a wrinkle on his nose brought the question of what I was doing, but he didn&#39;t dare ask. A man of orders, clearly. But he was about to get really uncomfortable really quickly. He was probably about 5&#39;10&quot;, a pretty average height. But he had a very strong build. The black shirt the company clearly made him wear was straining against his muscular chest even before I had written anything. Strong biceps filled the sleeves of the shirt and his heavy chest pushed far out in front of him while his thin waist pulled back in. The shirt seemed to cling to his body.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I thought that would be the first to go, but it was his fingerless gloves that popped off of his hands. He had been flexing his hands ever so gently as he started to grow. Without much room for growth, the tight fitting gloves instantly started to press against his growing palms and the lower rung of his fingers. There was a loud rip and then they just fell to the ground. The man didn&#39;t even notice, though I was starting to wonder about his feet. He&#39;d already grown a few inches in height, passing 6 foot pretty easily. <br />
<br />
His shirt was lifting out of his black pants and showing off his lower set of abs. He naturally pulled at the collar as it clung to his neck, but did everything in his power not to look uncomfortable. It didn&#39;t matter that his sleeves were rolling over his shoulders or fabric of the shirt started to stretch and pull around his body. Nor did he seem to notice as another row of abs appeared as he grew taller and taller. His stoicism never faltered. Though, he did seem to let out a breath of release as the shirt ripped down his back. Then his front. And the remnants fell down to the floor. <br />
<br />
Or maybe it was just because his feet were finally freed from their confines. The hard leather boots clearly weren&#39;t made to be stretched. Any amount of growth had to be incredibly uncomfortable as his toes pressed up against the insides. But there could only be so much pressure before his feet were able to push out of them, crushing them under his weight. With the fronts torn off, the sides were quickly to come with it as the seam holding the soles to the leather came under, snapping under the pressure.<br />
<br />
The guard&#39;s head was growing past the door frame. He must have been 7 foot but still built the same way he was when he was only 5&#39;10&quot;. His shoulders and arms were impossibly big. Far larger than any bodybuilder could ever imagine of getting them. He was already strong, but with the constant increase in size, he would be undeniably the strongest man in the world. <br />
<br />
Still, he wasn&#39;t done growing as his pants had yet to tear off of his body. The belt had already snapped under the growing pressure from his growing waist but the bagginess that had been given to them gave him quite a bit more room to grow. It was obviously used for function as he needed to run. Now they were running up his calves, looking more like capris than pants. He jostled around a bit while his pants started to cling to his thighs. The thick muscles clearly didn&#39;t want to be restrained and more importantly what was in between them sure didn&#39;t like the added pressure. <br />
<br />
Eventually they ripped and fell down around his feet. He naturally stepped on top of them. But he was still growing. I stared blankly at his underwear. The black boxers were straining against his legs. The stretchy elastic band doing everything in its power to not give up. He shifted his weight from side to side to relax his junk, but there was no space for it to go. The growth seemed to be speeding up. After he&#39;d grown past 8 feet it seemed like he was at 9. His head was getting dangerously close to the ceiling. I watched in awe as his relatively thin waist continued to strain against the band. I could almost hear it start ripping as he closed in on the ceiling. His head just inches away. Arms thicker than my entire body. Legs that were bigger than fully grown trees. The band continued to hold.<br />
<br />
Until, a loud snap filled the silent room. The loose fabric from the boxers had already given way while the band was the only thing still holding them up. They fell down around his feet and he let out a deep breath. A feeling of comfort obviously washing over him as he stood there naked in the room with another man. His head was a mere inch away from the 10 foot ceiling, but his spiked up black hair rubbed gently against it.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when an older man entered the room. The guard stood at full attention. &quot;At ease,&quot; the older man said. &quot;Please step outside.&quot; The guard did as he was told, ducking to get through the doorframe but struggling with how big he&#39;d gotten. His eyes focused on me. &quot;And what are you doing here?&quot;</p>
