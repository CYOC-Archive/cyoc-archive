<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa did feel quite pleased at finding a spare costume that she could wear. As she checked it out it might be on large size, but wasn&#39;t so much so that she couldn&#39;t wear it. Which meant it was likely something that Anna Bell had worn as a costume in year&#39;s past, as she hadn&#39;t reached the point in a were&#39;s puberty where she would truly begin to grow. Melissa felt rather lucky at that. The paired costume that Trevor had pulled out of the other trunk was a bit bigger and might even be a bit big on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think these went back a Halloween from a couple of years ago,&quot; Trevor commented as he looked over the costumes, &quot;I can&#39;t remember if it was a Halloween party or one of the few years that dad took the family trick or treating... but he got this one to do something for Anna Bell. But I think it&#39;ll work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Anna Bell won&#39;t mind?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so,&quot; Trevor shrugged, &quot;as I said... dad doesn&#39;t get into the costume thing too much... and I think Anna Bell is happy that you and I have been dating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa gave a small chuckle as she and Trevor made their way to the fold up ladder that they&#39;d climbed to get into the attic. Juggling the costume was a bit of a task, but she did manage to make her way down the stairs. Trevor was ultimately close behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she gave that away at lunch,&quot; Melissa quipped.<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded as he then folded up the ladder and lifted it. He then flipped a latch so that the ladder to the attic was firmly closed and wouldn&#39;t leave the hallway blocked. He then flicked a switch on the wall, which turned the lights in the attic off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Trevor said weakly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if she and Clint said anything that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fine,&quot; Melissa assured him, &quot;in a way it was kinda cute to hear Anna Bell say that she hoped we&#39;d be happy, get married, and have lots of babies... It&#39;d be something would show some support.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor found himself unable to say anything as Melissa gave him a small smile. He did manage a small nod in response to Melissa&#39;s comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the comment about wanting you to be happy and so on left me rather curious... as to what&#39;s gone on?&quot; Melissa asked. &quot;I mean... you&#39;ve been a good guy to me... and very handsome. Wouldn&#39;t any girl were want you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor felt himself blush at being described as handsome. He then scratched the back of his head a bit as he looked back to Melissa as he looked for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there have been those who have been interested,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;but given that every were species is so... so... healthy... it isn&#39;t quite like weres within Moon Lake truly stand out. In many ways it does mean that weres, while they can be far more sexually active than normal humans due to their higher libido... it will also mean that love is the thing that is often the most looked for. A were may take a bit of fun... but it&#39;s love that they want... And while there have been some girls in school that have had interest... it&#39;s just that hanging out with them... never really had anything that felt special. But when I&#39;ve been with you... things DO feel special. Sometimes it feels like I can barely talk straight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d fit with what your mom and dad said,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;about love having unexplainable victories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded to that. The two then stood alone in the hallway and looked to each other. Eventually the pair managed some weak smiles before Melissa said something, her memory jogged by the word &quot;unexplainable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Trevor,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;For not getting mad over... my &quot;mirror friend.&quot; Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s odd... even by Moon Lake&#39;s standards,&quot; Trevor said slowly, &quot;you said you&#39;ve had dreams of interacting with her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... nearly every night,&quot; Melissa admitted as they began to walk toward the living room, which they found to be empty. &quot;Some times she gives me advice on life... my decision to be the family were, before... you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded. Harold Jenkins being clawed by Virginia McCoy was a big event, but things on that front seemed to be settling. Melissa even thought that her dad was now seemingly embracing Moon Lake and all its inner secrets, despite the fact that he&#39;d been the most uneasy with it when they&#39;d first arrived. However, that wasn&#39;t the present issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;At first I thought it was just odd things running through my mind... but then it just kept repeating,&quot; Melissa said weakly, &quot;You must think I&#39;m crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor ushered Melissa over to the couch and helped her down and then sat beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not crazy... it&#39;s unusual, even by Moon Lake standards, but not crazy,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;the dreaming aspect sounds similar to what some describe as a prophecy dream... but that&#39;s something that&#39;s only been claimed by weres and that only relates seeing the future. Conversation on present events is something... not seen... and from what I&#39;ve heard never with normals, but I don&#39;t have the training to judge on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you believe that?&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;believe in these &quot;prophecy dreams,&quot; I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never given much thought on it,&quot; Trevor admitted, thinking briefly of the dream he&#39;d had of him and Melissa out at his spot, both as fully transformed werecattle and enjoying their thirty years together, &quot;but as I said... I&#39;m not one to really be a judge on that. But that doesn&#39;t mean I think you&#39;re crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what do you think it is?&quot; Melissa wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Trevor admitted, &quot;maybe it&#39;s something spiritual. You said this &quot;mirror you&quot; resembles you or a younger version of your mother... maybe her spirit is looking after you. Something like that. As people have believed in spirits doing things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So my mom&#39;s ghost is haunting me?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like protecting you, from what you&#39;ve told me,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;but again... that is at best only a guess on my part. I know there have been stories, but I haven&#39;t looked too closely into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of that made some sense, but Melissa wasn&#39;t necessarily the type to believe in spirits. Though, before moving to Moon Lake she also didn&#39;t believe in weres being real, and now her father was one and she was dating one.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sucks is that there is no way to prove it,&quot; Melissa shrugged leaned against Trevor, &quot;and when I&#39;ve talked with this &quot;mirror friend...&quot; all the answers abut who she is are cryptic. It&#39;s weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Trevor said slowly and wrapped an arm over Melissa&#39;s shoulder, &quot;but... so far... it would seem that this spirit isn&#39;t malicious.  And if it is out to get you... I&#39;ll do my best to protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa smiled at that and then cuddled up to him, feeling safe in Trevor&#39;s arms and by his side. She never wanted to lose that feeling and even with the supposed threat that Alice Decrux hoped to pull, she did look forward to going to the dace.</p>
