<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>You just stand there, staring at Peter and the mural of a large full moon behind him, not even noticing the changes the both of you had gone through. Looking him over, Peter is slightly being illuminated by the mural, which seemed to have low level lighting behind it, giving it the look of the actual moon glowing. You notice something now, actually checking him out this time, that somehow he was tighter in his clothes. Before, it appeared that his clothes hung loose on him, but now they could barely contain his thick muscled body. He notices you noticing him and Peter just smiles, showing off his pearly and perfect white teeth.</Br>
<Br>Peter motioned for you to come near him and when you did, he whispered in your ear. "You know, you don't look too bad as a muscle bound hairy hunk like like me. You should give yourself a look in the mirror one day and remind yourself that you are one good lookin' stud."</Br>
<Br>Wondering what he meant by "muscle bound hairy hunk" but then you catch sight of your exposed arms. Peter was right, you had changed into a muscle bound hairy hunk, but you wondered how. You had a thick pelt of man hair all over your body and now that you think about it, you did remember feeling tight in your loose fitting clothes moments ago, but dismissed it as your overactive imagination. Now, you knew that it wasn't your mind playing tricks on you. Curious, you were about to ask something to Peter when you noticed other things about him and yourself.</Br>
<Br>Looking at him still smiling, you could see his teeth, but they weren't normal. They were longer, sharper, and fang like. Your eyes grew wide, but you didn't know if it was in shock or want to be like him, while gasping. Peter places a thick, meaty, and hairy right hand on your left shoulder and smiled.</Br>
<Br>"What's wrong there buddy?"</Br>
<Br>"You... you are a... werewolf?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah and you are going to end up like me now!"</Br>
<Br>"What!?"</Br>
<Br>Peter smiled wryly at you, while holding your neck muscles, keeping you in place while he explained. His voice, as you now heard, was deeper than it had been. It sounded gruffer, more animalistic if animals could actually speak. "That drink you are holding Full-Moonshine, you didn't think that the name was a gag did you?"</Br>
<Br>"Well no... I..." You stopped mid-sentence, both shocked and amazed that your voice was just as low as his, while feeling total illicitness since you never thought your voice would ever drop into the octaves of a "real man" as your dad would call it.</Br>
<Br>"You didn't think twice about it? You didn't think there was anything strange with the name?"</Br>
<Br>Getting used to your new voice, you spoke up and loud very quickly. "I just thought that the name was cool. Also, with the full-moon and everything, I just figured that the brewery was just going completely authentic. I just never imagined it would be THIS authentic!"</Br>
<Br>Peter just chuckled. "Well, I was going for what I wanted."</Br>
<Br>"What you wanted???"</Br>
<Br>"That would be correct! I am the owner of the brewery and I am the last living werewolf. All my other brothers died while we came here from our dying planet several light years away."</Br>
<Br>"I know this might sound redundant, but... what?!"</Br>
<Br>Peter just smiled, showing off again. "You see, werewolves are from another planet. We, back when things began, were human like all of you here on Earth. One day though, something happened to the two suns that lit our planet like yours does here. No one really knew what was going on, but it went into the blue spectrum until the planet's moon synced up with the first sun that went blue. Once that happened, the other sun remained like yours here. Then, one night after the sun set and the moon came out, there was an ominous light that glowed from the moon, affecting everyone. Before we knew it, we had changed into weres of different sorts. Some were werewolves like myself and now you, others were werebears. That was it, only those two species existed and humanity as we thought it solely existed was over. Some of us couldn't live like we were going to have to, so they went to space and air-locked themselves, jettisoning themselves out into space, making their lungs implode. The others, like myself, left the planet in search of a new home, but in the long journey here they went crazy. Ultimately, they did what my brothers did and I was left alone till I landed here on Earth. After that, I found Pleasure Island to be the safe haven I knew I needed, since I had heard that their liquor changed boys or men into donkeys. I wanted to give people a different alternative."</Br>
<Br>"Wow, you know how far fetched that sounds? A werewolf exists, but he is an alien."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, exactly! Have you ever heard of a human like yourself turning into a werewolf for real before. I know there are movies and such, but hell, they make us look bad! I don't want to even get started on them, a few of my kind came here once before in search of a new home when the change first happened and then people saw them change into werewolves. So then to scare people, they made up all this bull and made our kind look bad."</Br>
<Br>You interrupt him, knowing that he would go on and on, even though he didn't want to. "What does it feel like and what is going to happen?"</Br>
<Br>Peter just smiles again. "Well my man, you are about to find out because I am ready and it is that time!"</Br></p>
