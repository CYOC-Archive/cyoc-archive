<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drumming her fingers on the steering in thought, Petra shrugged and figured convening with her friend is the best course of action. Shifting to one hip for a moment to slide out her phone, she flicked it open and began texting Sarah.<br />
<br />
&#39;Something serious happened. Need to meet u at ur place right now. Privately.&#39;<br />
<br />
Pressing send, she leaned back in her seat to wait for a reply and sighed out. She had luckily parked her car in a fairly hidden location with the building&#39;s wall behind and a tall looming tree in front, giving her a secure spot to rest. It seemed pretty safe to take this moment of pause, so she let her mind and senses wander.<br />
<br />
Looking out of her windshield, it truly was a beautiful day out. The sky was deeply blue with hardly any obstructive clouds to dampen the bright sun above. Her previously tautly folded ears relaxed, blossoming to the faint chirping of birds and rustling of leaves in the delicate wind. The decorative flower bed in front of the lot she walked past many times now made itself additionally apparent by caressing her nose with its sweet scent. She couldn&#39;t help but smile in joy at how much more wonderful the world around her seemed, her hands slipping off the steering wheel and resting in her lap. Shivers ran down her spine, relaxing all the muscles they passed, making her giggle at the tickling catharsis of the whatever tension was left in her body. Finally, the warmth of the overhead sun like a cozy blanket sealed the deal. Her eyelids slipped down without her even realizing and gave sleep a prime opportunity to pounce and overtake her. <br />
<br />
What felt like only a second passed and a sharp ting suddenly shook the dozing Catgirl out of her pleasant nap. Taking a few rapid blinks and breathing in deeply to stretch, she flicked open her phone.<br />
<br />
&#39;Leaving right now. Parents are out and brother has soccer practice late so we&#39;re good for a while.&#39;<br />
<br />
Petra smiled in relief that her friend took the situation seriously and was so willing to help. She typed out a quick reply.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ty soooo much. On my way too.&#39;<br />
<br />
Dropping her phone in the cup holder and then shifting to her other hip to get her keys out, she finally popped them into the ignition. Turning them quickly, the engine roared to life. Glancing into her mirror before backing up, she did a double take at the apparent sight of the new protuberances atop her head. It might be smart to at least hide them while driving to avoid anyone getting curious.<br />
<br />
Reaching over into her passenger seat, she picked up and slipped on the beanie she normally saved for some bad hair days. It&#39;s baggy loose design was perfect in the allowance it made for her relatively tall and pointed ears. With it set comfortably, she put her car in reverse, backed out, and turned onto the road leading out from her campus. Luckily it was still passing period, so there was no one else on the way to see her leaving before she finally turned out onto the town&#39;s main road.<br />
<br />
The rest of the drive was fortunately uneventful with fairly minimal traffic, which made sense since everyone was either at work or at school right now. Taking the last turn into the cul de sac which contained her friend&#39;s home, Petra pulled over to the side of the road to park. Sarah still was on her way so it gave her some time to figure out how to conceal herself so she didn&#39;t catch any attention on the eventual walk into the house. <br />
<br />
She had on her convenient beanie, and her extra fur patches could maybe just be confused for either sleeves or socks, but her tail was far too conspicuous. It was just too long and she knew she couldn&#39;t resist the inclination to flick and wave it behind her as she walked. Running her hands over it&#39;s resting form in her lap, it awoke like a playful snake and waved it&#39;s tip around in front of her. She smirked at how cute it was, but the problem was that some nosy onlookers might have quite a different opinion. With no other clothing in her car, the best she could do was try to wrap it around her thighs a couple of times and attempt to keep its coiled form hidden underneath her skirt. Resolving to that, she reclined her seat back and lifted her knees to rest on the bottom of the steering wheel before guiding her tail over and under her legs. Despite how flexible it seemed, it felt quite uncomfortable to have her tail bent up in such a way, something that a sour grimace on her face thoroughly resonated. A groaning complaint left her throat, but some relief came as she saw Sarah&#39;s car drive past her and park into the driveway ahead.<br />
<br />
The engine&#39;s purr turned off and out stepped her friend. She was wearing a fairly modest blue blouse and had on a pair of old jeans, their lightly torn and washed up color giving them a well worn look. The aged sneakers she also adorned on her feet were in a similarly distressed state with some holes and frayed laces. Despite her choice of clothing, she was honestly very pretty with her long wavy brown hair that fell down over her bosom and sharp light blue eyes. Her prominent cheekbones and pert lips gave her quite a strong and confident air, something that Petra always admired and knew she would be the best to console in.<br />
<br />
She turned to look at Petra and waved at her to come in with a wide and comforting smile. Petra couldn&#39;t figure out why at the moment, but something was almost magnetic about her. She loved to hang out and have fun with her as they did in the past many times, but now Petra felt like she wanted to get even closer and trust her with so much more. Conveniently, those heartfelt desires lined up pretty well with the forthcoming events, but something just made her feel like as long as she had Sarah, everything would be alright. <br />
<br />
Petra waved and smiled in return, popping open her car door to step out while holding her skirt with her wound tail underneath. Using her free hand, she tucked the spellbook under her arm and locked up her car before beginning to awkwardly walk over to Sarah. As she made her way over, the look of light amusement was thoroughly present in her friend&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, Petra? When you texted me I thought you were in some real trouble, and not just a fashion crisis. Those are some wild sleeves and socks. And why a beanie on a warm day like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra laughed, almost losing her composure as the momentary humor caused her tail to suddenly jerk around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Sarah. Thanks so much for coming so quick. No, that&#39;s not quite the issue but it does have to do with those things you mentioned. Can we quickly go inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah raised an eyebrow in her puzzled demeanor, but nodded and led her friend through the door and into the living room before closing it behind the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you close the blinds on the front windows too? I uhh...I&#39;ll show you in a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah now gave her friend a very confused look, but yielded to her request and quickly turned the blinds closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you really got me worried now. Is someone hurting you? You know you can tell me these things and I&#39;ll make sure they never bother you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah clasped a fist into her palm to show her protective intent, but Petra shook her head quickly to dispel that kind of idea. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not that kind of thing either. It&#39;s something I kind of did to myself. I umm...lemme just show you instead but l need you to promise not to freak out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah crossed her arms and firmly nodded, her expression softened and caring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise, absolutely. There&#39;s not much I haven&#39;t seen that can scare me still.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra smiled in appreciation and let out her held breath, relaxing her shoulders. She paused to look around a moment and saw the same room she and Sarah had spent many evenings over many years since they  had met each other in elementary school. The old immovable CRT television still stood at the far wall&#39;s center with a couple of worn couches surrounding it at the other ends. A small but wide wooden coffee table with numerous soda can imprints stood in front, atop it some DVDs and video games the two would spend numerous late nights enjoying together. She moved some of the plastic boxes out of the way and set down the spell-book.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t as elegant and modern of a home as her own family&#39;s, but to Petra it felt so much more warm and real. Whenever she was hanging out there, it always felt much easier just being herself. Reveling in the familiarity of this place definitely made her more comfortable in the vulnerable leap she was about to take.<br />
<br />
Taking a gulp of light nervousness, Petra let go of where her hand had been clasping her skirt and tail underneath. The long slender limb unraveled and fell, ribboning down her legs once and then twice before settling it&#39;s full length behind her. Finally freed from its confines, she closed her eyes and let herself freely sway and flick it with all the muscles she had previously constrained now being free to stretch and relax. It did feel really nice to do that, as likely made apparent to Sarah by the dopey grin the sensation produced on her face. Even with the beanie&#39;s cloth covering her ears, Petra heard the sharp breath Sarah took in surprise at her tail&#39;s reveal, so Petra figured it best to tear off the whole band-aid at once. Reaching up, she slipped off the hat as well. Her ears flicked and swiveled, scanning around for noises but eventually settling on their most interested source right in front. Petra could just barely hear the heartbeat of Sarah quicken in reaction to what she was witnessing. She honestly wasn&#39;t sure what kind of reaction Sarah would have at this since she never even remotely hinted to her the secret desires that have only now been manifested in front of her. Whether it would be dismay or intrigue, she knew at least that Sarah would never betray or hurt her, and that she could fully trust her. Petra opened her eyes and looked up to her friend. <br />
<br />
She right away noticed how wide Sarah&#39;s unblinking eyes were in surprise at what she saw. Out of all the things that were just prior tumbling in her head at what reason Petra called for her, this was definitely not one of them. It&#39;s not an everyday thing that your childhood friend suddenly becomes half-feline, but oddly enough it suited her quite well. Although Sarah never told her, she always in her mind jokingly posed her friend as a cat. From her curious nature to her skittishness, playful mannerisms, and affinity for regular daytime napping, she fit the bill almost to the T. She was just lacking the physical appearance and meowing, but now even the former and possibly the latter were now actualized. Just looking at her now as a Catgirl with an obviously expectant look for approval in her eyes was far too endearing, and she couldn&#39;t help but let the sides of mouth gently turn upwards.<br />
<br />
She was glad that Petra only went as far as she did with her changes, but it still did stir up a whirlwind of questions she didn&#39;t know where to even begin asking. Her mouth hung open trying to figure out what words to form, yet her mind was far too engrossed in the sight before her. At first she just saw it as a cute costume Petra wanted to express herself with, but the longer she stared at those feline features and observed the way they fluidly moved seemingly on their own, the weaker that inference became. But no one just up and grows a tail or moves their ears up their head like that. She thought that surely Petra must have gotten some kind of new age body modification surgery, or maybe she&#39;s playing some trick on her with animatronics. Before she could get her words together to ask, Petra took initiative on the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for not freaking out. And yeah. They&#39;re real&quot;, Petra said in a very matter of fact tone, adding a flick of her tail to emphasize that truth. <br />
<br />
Petra smiled weakly to make it all seem much less serious than it was, but Sarah just kept staring, her eyes traveling between the swiveling ears atop her head and the flicking tail behind her legs. She thought maybe she still didn&#39;t believe her. Unsure if it would help the situation, Petra turned herself sideways and lightly bent down at the knees, swaying her tail out right in front of Sarah for her to see up close. In doing so, her tail inadvertently lifted up her skirt as well, giving her friend quite an eyeful of her bare bottom if she chose to wander her gaze downwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can ummm...touch it if you want. It&#39;s really sensitive so don&#39;t squeeze or tug on it too hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those words felt so strange to roll off of her tongue like that, especially being addressed to someone present in the room with her. She felt the heat in her blushed red cheeks rising between her initial reveal and what she was doing now, but she was too far along to pull out. At this point, she just wanted some kind of response other than pure shock from Sarah. She wasn&#39;t worried what would happen if she disapproved. All she wanted to know was what she honestly thought. Nervously biting her lip, she watched her friend&#39;s focused face as she slowly reached out with her hand to meet the presented appendage. <br />
<br />
When her hand first met her tail, her fur instinctively bristled, causing Sarah to pull back for a moment, but as Petra could tell from her softening face, it only made her all the more interested. Laying her hand atop it now more insistently, she waited until Petra&#39;s raised fur relaxed and smoothened to her touch. Upon that, she gently began sliding her hand up her tail, being very careful not to apply too much pressure at any given point. Sarah&#39;s concentration was so deep, the owner of the object of mystique couldn&#39;t help but smirk and suppress a giggle, both due to the look of fascination on her face and the light tickling her touch produced. Her hand eventually rounded the tip of the appendage, at which point a viscerally electric tingling feeling suddenly coursed down its length and up Petra&#39;s back. She shuddered with a barely audible gasp, but it was enough for Sarah to notice and pull her hand away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, did I press too hard? I was trying my best to be really careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra hadn&#39;t gotten that kind of feeling from her tail before. Although it was a bit off-putting at first, as it settled she began feeling a subtle heat slowly but surely developing deep in her core. She laid her hand onto her lower abdomen just above her furred pelvis, noticing the warmth just barely strong enough for her to feel through her palm. Her brow furrowed up in thought as to what that feeling could mean, but in the corner of her eye she saw the rising worry in her friend&#39;s face. Not wanting to stress her out, whatever the sensation was, Petra resolved that it would probably subside on its own. She looked into Sarah&#39;s eyes with a reassuring smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not your fault at all. It&#39;s just that I never felt the tip before and I didn&#39;t expect it to be so sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
As strange as that feeling was, its oddity was easily enough for her innate curiosity to take hold. She wanted to know what other hidden sensations she could experience from her tail, and having Sarah there to do it only made it easier. And quite a bit funner to be honest. With a sly lick of her lips, she brazenly continued to her request.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can be a bit more firm on the rest of it though. When you pet my tail like that it actually felt pretty good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words she was speaking out loud were baffling for herself to hear. It was in complete disregard to all the effort she made to keep such deeply rooted and strong feelings about her secret desire at bay. But at the same time, it felt amazingly liberating and thrilling for her to finally let go and confide them to someone she really trusted. The hard part of breaking the ice was over. Now she could enjoy the flavor of the forbidden fruit, and how sweet it really is.<br />
<br />
Sarah hesitated a moment as if to say something first, but instead shook her head and resumed her petting of Petra&#39;s tail. Her hand more firmly grasped around its form, folding her fur down with the grain as she moved along it, the motion all the while tantalizing the sensitive skin underneath. If she was being honest, she was extremely impressed with the appendage in her hand. The fur was incredibly soft and luscious to the touch, which was quite stark in contrast to the tautly strong muscles underneath that were needed to swiftly control its near meter long length. Not only was she enamored with how it looked, but she could only imagine how much it helped Petra&#39;s balance and grace. On top of all that, she wished she knew how it felt since during her petting, Petra had noticeably deepened the arch of her back to meet Sarah&#39;s touch and had let her eyes glaze over in pleasure. <br />
<br />
At the receiving end, Sarah&#39;s assessment was spot on. With the stroking on her tail now much more firm and thorough, the previous tickling sensation grew into full on bliss. The brief touch she made upon her own tail back what felt like ages ago in the school bathroom hardly scraped the surface of the pleasure her tail could bring. This feeling now was unlike anything she had experienced before. On its own, it wasn&#39;t an intense overtly sexual kind of pleasure that made her just want release, but more of one that made her want to just curl up somewhere cozy and savor it forever. To be more direct, it felt like a combination of the immense satisfaction that came with relieving an itch she didn&#39;t know she even had, and the intimate warmth of a hug from a loved one. She smirked to herself at that realization, now being able to put a concise description to that odd warm feeling she felt before. The more the luxurious treatment from Sarah went on, the more that warmth grew in proportion. Petra had to desperately fight the desire to jump right into her friend&#39;s arms and let the both of them fall onto the couch behind in a tight embrace. The range of her experience was hardly over however, because once the aura of that feeling grew to reach her chest, Petra felt something unlatch inside. Right then, a low rumbling began emanating almost right at her bosom, the vibration resonating throughout the rest of her body. Soon it grew enough to become audible to Sarah who right away knew what it was and couldn&#39;t hold back her giggling. Petra must have been far too distracted with delight to notice it, which made it all the more funny, but was now broken out of that trance by Sarah&#39;s sudden noise. Between chuckles she barely managed to force her words out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever happened to you, damn it was pretty thorough. I&#39;m sorry, but your purring is just too precious!&quot;<br />
<br />
With her faculties no longer impeded by the hypnotic pleasure, her ears flicked up to attention and fully caught the soft sound and its reverberation in her chest. Unfortunately with her realization of it, her purring quickly dampened before dissipating out completely, the only remnant of it being a sheepish grin on her face. Although a little bit reddened in the cheeks at being caught so unabashed in pleasure that she began purring, Petra at least had the good humor to join in as well in cracking up.<br />
<br />
One of the most preserving things in their friendship that kept them together through it all was that they never took themselves too seriously. This moment was no different at all, and once they both saw the hilarity of the scenario, they both couldn&#39;t hold back and erupted into full laughter. Sarah&#39;s grip slacked and Petra&#39;s tail slipped out and back down into its usual arch behind her, swaying one way and another as she hunched over clutching her chest breathlessly. Sarah slumped down onto the couch behind her, eyes shut tight and arms wrapped over her stomach with her hair fallen over her face. Petra seeing her soon followed suit. Per her lesson from before, she directed her tail out in front of her before sitting down and settling it across her lap. Her ears folded down, she was wheezing out of breath between laughs but still full of joy in her heart. It was at least an intense minute before the either of them settled down to only a few spurious bouts of cackling. Petra wiped away the tears from the side of her eyes with the fur on the forearm and made another remark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what would have happened if  I let you stroke my ears too. Halfway into that, I felt like I couldn&#39;t resist jumping into your lap and letting you pet me all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them fell into another short fit at that, throwing their heads into the cushions behind and emptying their lungs. After what felt like the most she had laughed in her life, Sarah replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I would have loved that! Your tail is so soft and cute and I don&#39;t think your ears are any less amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
At those words, Petra felt goosebumps form all over her bare skin, her furred parts bristling instead. A wave of heat washed over her face, even after all the laughter, and she took an excited gulp before turning her head to look over at her friend. Sarah somehow has never looked more sweet to her than now. She still had her beautiful wide smile and her disheveled hair only added a more wild flair to her allure. Her generous bosom was still heaving up and down after all the intense laughing and Petra wanted nothing more than for what she said to be truly genuine. Nervously she stuttered out to Sarah, her eyes bouncing to and from her gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-really? I mean I&#39;d really like that. O-only if you&#39;re okay with it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah felt at least as much, if not more attraction now towards Petra. Too often she felt Petra would retreat into her shell with her wants and desires, but now she has finally really opened up, and it was seriously charming for Sarah to see that in her. She still had that adorable goofy grin across her face, her new ears and tail pushing her cuteness even further, but it was her eyes that stole the prize in that moment. Sitting up for a moment to take a closer look, she ecstatically gasped at the one last augmentation neither of them had yet noticed. In her transformation, Petra had kept her normal bright green eyes, but her pupils were no longer round. They were now instead stretched vertically into sharp slits, their dagger points unknowingly piercing their way into Sarah&#39;s heart. She laughed seeing Petra&#39;s bewilderment at her sudden gasp and then answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;With those gorgeously deadly eyes, I&#39;d do anything you&#39;d ask...&quot;<br />
<br />
Between her words and the unmistakably sultry look in her eyes, Petra felt like she was going to burst at the seams. She felt ready to pounce onto Sarah then and there, but right before her feline hunter&#39;s instinct kicked in, the glint of the cover on the spell-book caught her eye. A fleeting idea in mind, her eyes betrayed her by darting quickly from Sarah&#39;s to the book and then back, but it wasn&#39;t fast enough to go unnoticed. Sarah, raising an eyebrow and peering over with a sly look on her face, spotted the object of interest.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t look like any book she&#39;d ever seen before with its ornate binding and engraved cover. She squinted to be able to barely discern &#39;Transformation Magyk&#39; written in an especially extravagant font. Then, it all suddenly clicked in her head. Everything from how Petra achieved her new form, to why she brought the book along in the first place. It all made sense to Sarah.</p>
