<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So how is your husband?&quot; Asked Timothy's mother, her three sister wives and husband <br />
out of Glendale at the moment but moving at lightning speed back to see Timothy as a <br />
wolf again as past as their legs or their mode of transport could carry them, she had <br />
remained to look after their pup. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery?&quot; Pearl asked, &quot;Ask wonderful as ever, but he suffered during the battle with Kurse <br />
and... I'm the only ones of his wives that isn't bedded up along side him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I see... in that case I wouldn't keep you from him...  so what is your next scheme for <br />
elevating him to Alpha Male as a sign of your love to him?&quot; She asked politely and <br />
conversationally. <br />
<br />
&quot;I ONLY DID THAT TWICE!&quot; Pearl blushed. &quot;And..... no... I haven't thought of what else I <br />
could do to have Alpha Jensen step down and have Zackery take his place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know that in the olden days that if you did manage it, he'd have to abandon you <br />
and your sister-wives, and take Kaylee and her sister-wives as his mates instead right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I do know... and... he could do such great things ... but I, Hope, Grace, June, sometimes I <br />
think we're the only ones to see past his exterior.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not true... &quot; She looked at Zelipe with Timothy. &quot;There's him and his sister yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl smiled, and nodded, &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't keep you from your wounded husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />

1689 August <br />
<br />
&quot;Gita, Goldwyn and Griselle were gonna make it so people would WANT to hurt each <br />
other!There wouldn't be a NEED for laws if everyone was happy and friends!&quot;  Joella finally <br />
shouted out her voice going hoarse. <br />
<br />
&quot;Order! I said this is not a debate!&quot; Dr. Azrael, &quot;The jury will ignore the witness when she is <br />
not the stand.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joella huffed and puffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise... I'll save your mothers if I can.&quot; Marie Cruz whispered to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I should take her back now.&quot; Vatican said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No... keep her for a tiny bit longer... just until I make my statement to the jury after the <br />
recess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot;  <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz stood up, &quot;People of the jury. <br />
<br />
The lives the defendants ended by transforming others and transplanting in them new <br />
identities, were done either when they were children, or after they performed their rune <br />
experiment on Glendale intending to give everyone in Glendale eternal childhood as written <br />
in their journal.  As children they knew no better. And after the experiment their behavior <br />
became something lost in a different world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they kill the men who tried to kill their foster child and planned to kill them, and their <br />
servants and their families? Yes. Could they have likely defended her in a way that need <br />
not have resulted in death? Yes. But, I will remind the court those men WERE trespassing, <br />
and openly stated their desire to commit murder. And I will contest most men or women if <br />
holding a loaded gun were to see someone aim a weapon at their child they would not <br />
hesitate to pull the trigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OBJECTION! CONJECTURE!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sustained. Last part shall be ignored by the jury.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie continued, &quot;... Had the law of the land or another legal or religious authority <br />
condoned the actions of these men? Unlikely.... &quot;<br />
<br />
Marie stopped for a moment, &quot;In that way, I suppose they were no different from myself, <br />
and my companions. Were they doing so to protect lives or boaster their own egos? We <br />
shall never known. Were the witches in their legal right to defend their family and property <br />
as they themselves saw fit? Debatable. But.... <br />
<br />
&quot;These witches are off in their own world. For us to execute them for their acts would be <br />
meaningless. We do not pass the death sentence upon the mad. We punish people for the <br />
actions the committed of their own free will. If the witches are indeed mad, does that not <br />
mean that they did not commit these acts of their own free will? To kill them because they <br />
are 'dangerous' to live? That is the justification that Marcus Brutus was given to assassinate <br />
Julius Ceasar! Are the various child familiars 'too dangerous' to live because they might <br />
inherit the witches' gift? What of the ones that are mad, and might indeed have that power? <br />
Shall we execute them along with the defendants? Just to be safe? How can we be sure <br />
which ones are safe and which ones are dangerous? Perhaps we should kill them all just to <br />
BE 'safe?'&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Joella screamed as Vatican held her in place. <br />
<br />
'I am no nun, I am a manipulative bitch.' Marie Cruz thought as the fairies looked at Joella <br />
with tears in her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;The point is... if the witches are indeed insane. As is what I seek to prove. To kill them <br />
because they are 'too dangerous' would open the door... who ELSE shall we kill because <br />
they are 'too dangerous?'&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And it did open the door,&quot; Betty ask in a slightly depressed voice, &quot;Didn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza nodded, &quot;Linus had no idea that many of his arguments would be perverted <br />
and warped and used in the witch trials... though the defendants there would, so I have <br />
heard, be offered no legal council.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you have heard?&quot; Maddex's two heads asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've never studied on the subject, and I am not all knowing. Only what the game 'knew.' <br />
The game actually SCARED people in Glendale into NOT accusing others of being witches... <br />
So I have no knowledge of such proceedings.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you 'know' the defenders of the witch trials had no legal council, and yet you say <br />
'so I heard' not most strange?&quot; Alice spoke up, breaking her silence at last, &quot;The larger any <br />
faith or religion, the less likely people are question unkind things said of that religion, <br />
quite the opposite of how people reacted two thousand years ago I have read.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza only nodded, &quot;Many things are the opposite of what they once were.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;If the witches are found innocent,&quot; Marie Cruz continued her argument, &quot;I move their <br />
deaths would be pointless. The threat is via their magic, not themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
'This is cheating, this isn't meant to exist for two hundred years... and I'll pay for this <br />
cheating if it comes to pass, but I have to try my best as the defense.'  <br />
<br />
&quot;... I know of a procedure that... can disable their use of magic, which I will only go into <br />
more detail of if they are indeed found innocent. Which I hope the jury does.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza, &quot;She didn't know the word, but Marie Cruz knew she could lobotomize the <br />
witches, cutting off the parts of their brains that enabled them to do magic...&quot;</p>
