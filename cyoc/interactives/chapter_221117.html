<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Kim woke up first.  She felt something unusual between her legs and in her current state of mind, she thought it might be Greg poking her in the crotch.  She shifted her position and felt something hanging, but also an odd sensation she couldn&#39;t quite understand.  Reaching down with her hand, she slid it under the waistband of the pajama pants she was wearing and felt something fleshy...but she could also feel her hand as it made contact.  Sliding her hand a little further, the sensation only became more noticeable.<br />
<br />
Alarmed, Kim pulled her hand out of her pajama pants and rolled onto her back.  Her eyes opened and looked at the ceiling.  Memories of the previous evening flooded back into her mind.  She had participated in a lame magic show and the old magician had swapped everything below her waist with her husband.  She now had his feet, legs, testicles, and penis.  He had her feet, legs, vagina, and likely all the associated internal organs.<br />
<br />
She looked over at Greg.  He was still sleeping soundly.  She noticed that her dick was extended and she felt like she needed to pee.  Not wanting to disturb Greg, she slowly rolled out of bed and headed for the bathroom, turned on the bathroom light, and closed the door.<br />
<br />
She pulled the pajama bottoms down and faced the toilet, but had trouble pointing her dick toward the toilet bowl.  As she looked down, she noticed her pajama top seemed a bit tight around her stomach.  She pulled up the bottom of her satin pajama top and saw a hairy stomach sticking out above her dick.  She quickly looked at her sides and noticed her narrow waist was gone.  Looking into the mirror, she saw her reflection and what looked like Greg&#39;s body as her lower part starting from just under her breasts.<br />
<br />
Panic started to overcome Kim as she realized that more of her body had somehow become that of her husband overnight.  She stared at herself in the mirror.  She tried to figure out what to do as a million thoughts ran through her head.  She looked back down at her hairy stomach and felt the hair in her hands.  The texture confirmed that this was real.  She felt her hips and waist and noticed how much wider she now seemed to be.<br />
<br />
Letting out a sigh, Kim looked at her reflection again.  She tried to calm down and figure out what to do.  Noticing the toilet reflected in the mirror, she figured she should start by relieving herself.  With her thoughts distracted, she found it was now much easier to point her dick downward toward the toilet bowl.  Her aim was off slightly, but she soon corrected and she wiped up the misfire once she was done.<br />
<br />
Greg felt something on his hip.  He heard Kim&#39;s voice softly calling his name, but there seemed to be a little bit of a panic in her voice.  He rolled over and faced her.  &quot;Hey, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim stood next to the bed and lifted her pajama top.  &quot;I&#39;ve got your belly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg blinked.  &quot;What?&quot;  He sat up and pushed the sheets to the side and pulled up his T-shirt.  There was no hair visible and his waist appeared to be much narrower.  He ran his hand over his stomach and looked up at Kim.  &quot;Woah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Somehow we&#39;ve swapped bellies.  How did this happen?&quot; she asked, hoping Greg would have an answer.<br />
<br />
Greg shook his head.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  Last thing I remember was drinking the champagne, we had sex, and we went to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as we know, Marvin&#39;s not here.&quot;  She looked up at the hotel room door.  &quot;The door is still locked from the inside, so nobody could have come in.  If we didn&#39;t leave, that must mean that something in this room caused it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg still hadn&#39;t fully woken up and was still trying to process everything.  &quot;Was it the birth control pill you made me take?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kim replied.  &quot;I didn&#39;t take one.  If it was that, only you would have changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg tried to think of other reasons their midsections may have swapped.  &quot;Was it the champagne?  Maybe the cheese or crackers?  We both drank the whole bottle and ate most of the cheese and crackers.  Those ended up in our stomachs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s because we had sex?&quot; theorized Kim.  &quot;Do we change a little more every time we do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg held up his pajamas again and looked at his body.  &quot;At least it stopped before I got your boobs.&quot;  He squinted as he started to recall something from last night.  &quot;When we first changed, where was the line on your body where the changes started?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim lowered Greg&#39;s pajama bottoms that she was wearing and pointed to her waistline.  &quot;It was right here.  Almost exactly where my skirt was before I changed and where your pants ended up being after the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg nodded.  &quot;Yeah, I thought it was the same on me too, but then when I went to pee after we first tried our our new parts, I remember the line was just below my belly button.  Before bed, I saw it just <i>above</i> my...or your...uh, <i>the</i> belly button.  I was buzzed from the champagne and sex, so I thought I might have misremembered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the line is moving up?&quot;  Kim looked at her hairy belly.  &quot;It was roughly 5 hours since we first got changed in the magic show before we went to bed and so it moved up about 4 inches to just above your belly button during that time.  It&#39;s almost 9 o&#39;clock now, so we slept for about 7 hours and it went up about 6 inches.  It&#39;s early and my math is bad, but the speed is somewhere around less than 1 inch per hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim looked at her own stomach.  &quot;My torso&#39;s not as big as yours so it&#39;s not moving as fast, but it seems to be tracking with the same region.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it might not have been something we ate or something we did.  Maybe the swap has been growing this whole time,&quot; Greg theorized.  &quot;Oh, shit.  That means I&#39;m just a few hours away from having boobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget that,&quot; Kim said dismissively.  &quot;By this time tomorrow, we&#39;ll be totally swapped.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg let out a long, drawn out &quot;<i>Fuuuuuuck!</i>  If we&#39;re changed up to our necks, maybe Marvin can still swap us back by cutting us in two at our necks and swapping our whole bodies, but if our heads start changing, I don&#39;t know how we could ever swap back.  We&#39;d be stuck in each other&#39;s bodies forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we need to find Marvin today,&quot; Kim decided. &quot;Judging by your chest, I&#39;d estimate we&#39;ve got maybe 10 hours before our necks start to change.  Let&#39;s conservatively say 8 hours since we don&#39;t have a measuring tape for precise estimates.  That gives us a deadline of 5 PM, but maybe 7 PM.  After that, we&#39;ll be literally up to our necks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg looked at Kim blankly.  &quot;Har har.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized with a grin which was quickly replaced with sadness.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry I talked you out of chasing Marvin to the airport.  If we had taken care of this then, we might not be in this mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg took Kim&#39;s hand.  &quot;No, it&#39;s okay.  We didn&#39;t know.  You were right, too.  It was unlikely we&#39;d have found him before he got through security.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim smiled.  She still felt some guilt, but felt better going through this ordeal with her husband.  &quot;Let&#39;s get dressed and go find this guy!  Do you mind if I shower first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, go right ahead,&quot; Greg insisted.  &quot;I&#39;ll figure out this hotel room coffee pot.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Kim showered, she emerged from the bathroom and Greg noticed her legs.  &quot;You shaved my legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not your legs right now,&quot; Kim pointed out.  &quot;I&#39;m going to wear a skirt today and I couldn&#39;t have your leg hair showing down there.  I can&#39;t wear my pants or people might notice a certain bulge.  Don&#39;t worry, the hair will grow back after we swap back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg sighed in defeat.  &quot;Okay, fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim handed him a pair of jeans.  &quot;You can wear these after you shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those will make my butt look really obvious,&quot; Greg complained.  &quot;They look great on you, but I don&#39;t want my ass to look attractive to guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim scoffed at his remarks.  &quot;Look, you can wear those jeans or you can put the skirt back on.  We don&#39;t have a lot of options here.  Just stuff a sock in your crotch and nobody will think anything&#39;s amiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg looked at her with deadpan expression.  &quot;Please don&#39;t say I’m &#39;a miss&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim laughed which also made Greg laugh as he headed in for a shower.<br />
<br />
He came out to find Kim in his jeans and wearing a nice blouse which seemed to be stretched out around her belly.  She had placed fresh panties, white socks, her jeans, and one of Greg&#39;s polo shirts on the bed for him.  &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind, but I made a selection for you.  My tennis sneakers should fit you and they&#39;re white so nobody will think any different for you wearing them.  If…or when our chests start to swap, I can simply stuff my bra to keep up my appearance.  You might have a harder time.  I figured if you wore jeans and a polo shirt with your suit coat over it, the coat would help to hide any budding breasts but also help hide your slim waist and butt.  Plus, the jeans, polo shirt, suit coat look really works on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg agreed.  &quot;Okay, that sounds like a good plan.  I&#39;ll get dressed quickly and we can head out.  If we can&#39;t track down Marvin, maybe we can track down some other magician who knows the trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim grinned with excitement.  &quot;That&#39;s a great idea!  Someone else must know how it&#39;s done.  These guys share tricks all the time, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg shrugged.  &quot;Let&#39;s hope so!&quot;  He quickly finished dressing, pulled his suit coat out of the closet, and grabbed his wallet as they headed out the door.</p>
