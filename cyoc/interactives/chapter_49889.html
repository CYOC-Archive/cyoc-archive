<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick Hounds Sr. look at the telephone again, &quot;Jennifer got me so caught up in that silly <br />
game of hers that I didn't even think to ask why she sent me a mirror express mail -<br />
saying it would look good in my office!- And after Jennifer said she's too old for <br />
games...twenty or twenty five years ago...&quot; All the same he'd have time to ask these <br />
questions when he saw her in person and her husband.  &quot;I wonder what inspired her to call <br />
her grandfather after not sending me anything other than christmas card for ten years.... I <br />
wonder how little Jenny is doing,&quot; She acted like such a sweet little princess. It would likely <br />
take him a couple of days to get everything set for him to leave his business to run <br />
without him for a day or two, but he wasn't about to turn down a invitation at last. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
That same day and thus a couple of days before Julie would make her fated meeting with <br />
the woman who'd open her eyes to the truth of Glendale, Trevor laid lazily on the roof of <br />
Madame Serenity's place of business. His new home, and now perhaps the only home he <br />
could have.  <br />
<br />
Even though he knew his family had a policy of neutering all their pets, in his gut he knew, <br />
he would have given it up if it meant finally being with them but... he just couldn't... he <br />
didn't want to be with his family just so they'd shoe him out in the evening and look <br />
through him as a house pet during the day. <br />
<br />
The roof was warmish, nice, sunny, and all in all made Trevor feel lazily, it was a nice <br />
change of pace to that pet store window. Not to mention it had taken him forever to get <br />
used to the taste of pet food, as well as he had been able to eat in that damn muzzle <br />
strap!  The other cats in the pet store had actually teased him about it, knowing all he <br />
could say in reply was 'mumble mumble.' <br />
<br />
At least Madame Serenity acknowledged his personhood and allowed him to eat something <br />
other than dried fish and horse meat and relatively free reign of the building. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there cutie.&quot; He heard a meow translated as. <br />
<br />
He turned his head and saw a queen strut her way up onto the roof, checking him out like <br />
a piece of meat her tall and proud. Trevor knew next to nothing about cat breeds, he <br />
needed Madame Serenity just to tell him he was a tabby!  This cat looked about the same <br />
breed as him. <br />
<br />
Not knowing what else to say he replied, &quot;He-hello.&quot; <br />
<br />
The cat either didn't notice or care he was speaking in english as she continued to purr <br />
and call in sounds whose meanings rang as clear as day in Trevor's head. &quot;So... I don' <br />
recognize your scent, I take it you're new in the neighborhood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor noticed she didn't have a collar. Stray. &quot;Yes.&quot; Trevor said keeping his tone short and <br />
to the point. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, gotten to know anyone yet?&quot; She asked sultry. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Trevor conditioned by social convention asked, &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
The queen replied, &quot;Don't have one, don't need one, don't want one. What's yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd name. Your human must be one of those special people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Special?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... one of those humans who think they can understand what we're saying and only get <br />
it right half the time, and recognizes us for the master race we are.&quot; <br />
<br />
'I knew it.' Trevor thought but said nothing. At least he had kept his human mind enough <br />
that he hadn't started thinking of cat as the 'superior race.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Where was this one girl in town who'd feed us without humans of our own as a hobby, <br />
but soon after being upgraded somehow her family hightailed it out of town... things have <br />
gotten a bit annoying recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...upgraded?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bast or whoever must have blessed her devoted service with ears and tail, a step in the <br />
right direction, but she didn't seem to appreciate her gift, and like I said, her family <br />
vacated town soon after.&quot;<br />
<br />
'The girl from the pet store.' Trevor thought but again said nothing, &quot;So what brings you <br />
up here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just looking for some other human with too big a heart to mooch off of ... do you think <br />
your human could manage?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well... wanna work off the stress? You see tense...&quot; The queen rubbed against.<br />
<br />
Trevor felt his fur stand on end. &quot;Work off how?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. I'm sure you can guess big boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Trevor took a step back. <br />
<br />
The queen's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, &quot;A tom saying no to -me-? ... That's a first... &quot; <br />
She took a few step foreword. Something about her demeanor set Trevor on edge now.  <br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; She said sounding more serious than playful now, &quot;You just need some <br />
encouragement.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor leapt off the roof, the queen leapt off in pursuit a twitch of a whisker later, 'I <br />
thought this was only supposed to happen to the poor souls turned into female animals!!!' <br />
<br />
Trevor took back all the nasty things he ever thought about God as he saw the backdoor <br />
was open and dashed inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;CLOSEITCLOSEITCLOSEIT!&quot; Trevor said repeatedly to Madame Serenity who thank heaven <br />
happened to be right there. The elder woman complied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dog?&quot; She asked in a concerned voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;If a female cat with my coloring comes clawing at the door... do NOT let her in!&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor went to a corner and curled around himself and shivered. The worst part was, some <br />
part of him, and he wasn't sure if it was the human or the cat, had -wanted- to mate with <br />
her, so he'd leave at least one ripple in this universe after his time was done, which the <br />
curse had insured he'd only know had been cut dramatically short. When he heard a <br />
familiar meowing outside, he tried his hardest to tune it out and ignore the urge to let her <br />
him so she could let him in, and sow his seeds in her soil. Trevor was very glade he hadn't <br />
figured out how to open the door himself yet. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
A man wearing just a pair of worn beige short calmly played his banjo on the obscure <br />
tropical island in the middle of nowhere. It's remote location meant tourist only rarely <br />
came here, and he only knew english because he was an immigrant and no native.  He <br />
watched the waves crash against the sand for the millionth time that day plucking his <br />
banjo strings. He turned towards his modest dwelling which had the all the doors open. <br />
<br />
He wondered if he had been out in the sun too long as he saw a little girl werewolf ghost <br />
in a nineteenth or eighteenth century dress peak out from his bathroom mirror, and climb <br />
her way out, being covered in a film of glass or maybe -becoming- glass as she climbed <br />
out and set herself down. She walked out of the house as the banjo man watched her. She <br />
looked at the position of the sun then at her surroundings, she spotted the banjo man and <br />
mime curtsied at him. &quot;Hello and good day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Hello.&quot; Said he banjo man calmly staring at her slightly large eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may ask:  do you realize I am a glass wolf who has just climbed from your mirror? I <br />
think it is your mirror, that is, if it's your house of course....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my home... and yes I can see you're a glass wolf.&quot; the banjo man said in a surprised <br />
but not overwhelmed voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;And you do not feel like calling the dog catcher or telling me to put something on for my <br />
naked state?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir.&quot; The wolf curtsied again like it was a trained reflex. She didn't ask if she <br />
wasn't in Glendale city limits, the position of the sun told her that and she had traveled <br />
over a thousand miles in those three steps. &quot;I'd ask you to play with me in my world, but <br />
my family's gotten quite bigger recently and are expecting a few more before we're finally <br />
done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's quite alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
One last mime curtsy, &quot;Good day to you then sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the glass wolf girl went back into the mirror, while the banjo man went back to <br />
looking at the waves. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Alice?&quot; Darla asked when her daughter returned safe and sound, being indestructible <br />
didn't mean she couldn't be tied up and thrown into a volcano and Darla was glade to see <br />
her alright. <br />
<br />
She and Fran were in the master bedroom, Alice having used a large dresser mirror. The <br />
other cubs were with Martha back in the backyard reading since it would have been <br />
impractical to play the wii with all the activity going on in the living room and reading in <br />
the study would have been near impossible with the noise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything went perfect mother dearest!&quot; Alice nodded, &quot;I did not become Adam again <br />
when I left the city limits, and the person I talked to did not scream and shout or run from <br />
me upon laying eyes on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope they weren't stoned.&quot; Fran commented. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I do not think rocks were thrown upon him auntie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I hope he wasn't drugged up.&quot; Fran suddenly felt incorrect for using such terms <br />
around Alice. <br />
<br />
Alice thought for a moment, &quot;I do not think so... nor did he seem drugged down either.&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other. Then Fran knelt down and put a paw on Alice's shoulder, <br />
&quot;You've done a very brave service for the pack Alice, a very brave service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you auntie.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Now Alice.&quot; Fran put both her paws on Alice's shoulders and knelt down best she could <br />
so she was as close to eye level as she could be with the glass wolf. &quot;Auntie has a very <br />
important favor to ask you...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
All across town, four 'upper crust' teenage girls, one of whom whose only claim to fame <br />
was the proximity they had to the star cheer leader Jennifer Smith, after the school day <br />
was done and with no sign of their inner circle self proclaimed leader had called each other <br />
into a four way phone chat. <br />
<br />
&quot;So like, none of you saw Jennifer either?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nada!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn't lookin', figured ya all would for me.&quot; Said a forth voice over the phone followed by <br />
the sound of munching chips. <br />
<br />
Two sighs and one groan replied back to the last voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;So like, she didn't call any of you? Grace? Hope? Isabell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Zylphia she didn't.&quot; Grace answered, &quot;You think something happened to her?&quot; <br />
<br />
Hope said, &quot;She didn't call me either. I guess we aren't as important to her as she always <br />
makes us out to be, it's not like she COULDN'T pick out new friends if we got stale after <br />
all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't say That! She'd never do that!&quot; Said Grace sounding more angry at Hope that scared <br />
at the idea of Jennifer abandoning them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, she didn't call me...&quot; Isabell finished, &quot;I figure, if she wants to tell us somethin', she'll <br />
tell us, it's not like she's ever had a problem sayin' what's on her mind before, y'all hear <br />
what I'm sayin'?&quot; <br />
<br />
Zylphia spoke, &quot;So like, what's up with that? Do you think we give her space? Wait to see if <br />
she calls later or shows tomorrow or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Yawn Isabell's voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Said Hope's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We call.&quot; Said Grace, &quot;In fact, I vote we do that right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Grace that works for me just fine.&quot; Zylphia answered. &quot;You two have any objections?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might be interesting.&quot; Said Hope's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't stop you.&quot; Said Isabell. <br />
<br />
At that, Grace punched in Jennifer's cell phone number... it buzzed, buzz, and buzzed <br />
some more, and finally went to her voice mail. <br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't like Jennifer at all...&quot; Zylphia conclude, &quot;She never misses a phone OR doesn't <br />
have it with her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things happen.&quot; Hope said and Isabell agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm calling her house.&quot; Zylphia's voice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're wasting your time.&quot; Hope said, &quot;If she didn't answer her cell she won't answer the <br />
phone. <br />
<br />
The phone rang, and rang, and rang, Zylphia sighed knowing she'd be getting the <br />
answering machine on the next right. However, <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Smith Residence who may I ask is speaking?&quot; Said a feminine voice on the other <br />
end. <br />
<br />
All four teenager 'popular girls' hear construction work in the background. But that wasn't <br />
the issue at the moment. They didn't ask who it was. They had never seen many servants <br />
or work hands at Jennifer's house ever except Martha but figured she had more logically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah this Zylphia calling,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Grace!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Isabell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... shouldn't that be Grace Hope and Charity?&quot; Replied the voice on the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was funny only the first one hundred times.&quot; Shot Hope. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, look,&quot; Said Zylphia getting things back on track, &quot;Can we talk with Jennifer? She <br />
wasn't at school and she hasn't called and we're her friends and we're kinda worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, I shall inform Mistress Jenny.&quot; They were put on hold. <br />
<br />
&quot;'Jenny?'&quot; Hope said, &quot;Who'd have thought it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't.&quot; Isabell answered first. <br />
<br />
They waited several minutes. Hope was all for hanging up and letting it be, Grace was for <br />
all hanging up and calling again. Isabell just went along for the ride. Zylphia waited in <br />
silence only saying anything to keep the others on board. <br />
<br />
Finally a young female voice answered, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen'!&quot; Called Grace, &quot;Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your voice sounds a little high, you okay?&quot; Zylphia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phone's just bein' a little buggy, you guys okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Zylphia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; So did Grace. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Isabell answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much.&quot; Hope finished. &quot;So where were you exactly today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm being hope schooled now... sorry I didn't think yo call you sooner... hey guys! I have <br />
an idea! Why don't you all come over? We can make it sleep over for those of you who can <br />
stay long enough!&quot; <br />
<br />
All four girls started, normally Jennifer let these plans be known far off in advance, and <br />
home school? Jennifer -loved- the attention she got. Something wasn't right. But the only <br />
way to find out what was to go right to the source. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ... Jen', we'll bite.&quot; Said Hope, &quot;But you had better tell us what's really going on when <br />
we get there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I can drop by for a bit.&quot; Grace said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not doing anything else.&quot; Isabell confessed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that just leaves me.&quot; Zylphia said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay guys! Wait tell ya get here, yer infer da time of yer life! Come soon after sunset <br />
please. Oh and kiss yer mom and dads I mean parents goodbye will ya? Ya never know <br />
what tomorrow will bring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer hung up. <br />
<br />
All four girls were silent for a moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Said Hope, &quot;I'm going there just to find out what the heck is going on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot; Said Grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Triple.&quot; Zylphia added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quadruple.&quot; Isabell finished.  &quot;You think she's a vampire now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nay....&quot; Said Hope,&quot;Not enough angst...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd know.&quot; Grace said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just kidding.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that all four girls hung up and packed their things for a visit to Smith Manor.</p>
