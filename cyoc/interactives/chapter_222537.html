<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you leave making sure your school uniforms and girly pajamas, underwear, and makeup you had to buy to sell that you were actually a girl were packed you then wave bye to your parents and after getting a big hug from your mom you then board the bus that is going to be taking you to your college. Luckily the bus does not have a specific school branding on it and so you take a seat being one of the first people on the bus and wave bye to your parents. As you are sitting there and the other girls join the bus they look at you confused.<br />
<br />
Many of the girls passing by giggle at you and when one sit&#39;s down next to you you then blush beat red. She eye&#39;s you suspiciously and strikes up a conversation with you. &quot;so where are you headed?&quot; she asks you questioningly. Taken by surprise you tell her &quot;I&#39;m going to ST. Mary&#39;s same as you&quot; you tell her. She then narrows her eyes at you &quot;you do realize ST. Mary&#39;s is an all girls school right?&quot; she tells you with a worried look. You then internally facepalm at your mistake and quickly redouble. &quot;Well my girlfriend is attending and i am just tagging along to see her off&quot; you tell her blushing red.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh really?&quot; she asks you with a grin on her face &quot;then where is she? Wouldn&#39;t you two be sitting together on the bus?&quot; she asks and you rack your brain trying to make up a good excuse. &quot;well she&#39;s on a different bus so i was planning on surprising her when i get there&quot; you explain and that seems to satisfy her curiosity for the time being. &quot;Okay well, just wanted to make sure, ST. Mary&#39;s has a strict rule against boys trying to sneak in and will punish them harshly if they are found out i hear.&quot; You gulp nervously but stele your resolve, there is now way they will figure out you are actually a guy... Will they?<br />
<br />
Just then the Bus grinds to a halt right in front of the school &quot;okay lover boy, we&#39;re here&quot; she says to you teasingly and you wait there nervously thinking of how you are going to get ready to infiltrate the school without anyone noticing you. but luckily your question is answered for you as after a while of pondering this you realize you are the only one still on the bus and everyone including the bus driver is outside heading into the school. You then duck down into your seat after grabbing your bag and quickly get changed into one of the school uniforms you were sent.<br />
<br />
Taking out a compact that came with the makeup kit you bought you hastily apply makeup to your face to hide your identity the best you can and after stuffing your bra with tissue again you then shove your guy clothes into your bag again and remark at how much more comfortable panties are than boxers. And also how wearing a skirt leave so much of yourself exposed. Luckily the uniform came with some knee highs so it&#39;s not unbearable.<br />
<br />
As you are about to step off the bus however the bus driver then walks in and eyes you suspiciously. &quot;oi luv, your classmates are already inside for orientation. You better urry along now lest you be late!&quot; you thank the kind lady for the advice and rush off the bus. The shoes they provided with your uniform have a wedge on the heel making running a conscious effort but eventually you get the hang of it enough that you aren&#39;t toppling over every 5 seconds. You then rush inside and join your fellow classmates in orientation. None of them so much as look your way as you enter just thinking you are another one of the bright young girls here for a bright future.<br />
<br />
As the lady who you assume is the principal is going over orientation you then notice something and realize the girl that is standing directly in front of you is your girlfriend. Nervous you try to back away before she can recognize you or something but as you are attempting this you make more of a commotion than you would like and she turns around. &quot;hey there, my name is Casandra&quot; she introduces herself to you even though you already knew who she was. &quot;and what&#39;s your name?&quot; you then blush again as you tell her &quot;Danni, the name&#39;s Danni&quot; she then smiles at you warmly and says &quot;funny that&#39;s the same name as my boyfriend back home!&quot; and you then go pale again. &#39;Crap what will i do if she figures out who i really am...&#39; but then she looks at you concerned &quot;um are you okay?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
You then stammer out &quot;y-yes I&#39;m just fine thanks&quot; in your best impression of a girl. You aren&#39;t sure if she is going to buy it but she just gives you another warm smile and says &quot;Well it was a pleasure meeting you&quot; and with that she then turns back around to pay attention to the orientation again. You are facepalming internally from the interaction and pray that you don&#39;t get a dorm together. After orientation is done you are then all sat down in the bleachers to wait to be called on for your dorm room assignment. Luckily you are called in after your girlfriend so that way she does not hear the teacher speak your last name blowing your cover wide open.<br />
<br />
As you sit there with the teacher typing away at her computer in silence she then eyes you with the most intense stare you&#39;ve ever seen in a teacher and you instantly get nervous again. &#39;Does she know I&#39;m not actually a girl?&#39; you think to yourself but then the teacher breaks the Ice. &quot;So, Ms. Summers your dorm room will be number 173 and you will have Ms. Forrest as your roommate. Do you have any questions?&quot; You then shake your head no and take the room key from her. She then gives you that intense stare again as if she is looking into your verry soul. &quot;Verry well then, you are free to go.&quot; She tells you &quot;oh and don&#39;t forget that all students must see the nurse for your nightly sleep aid&quot; she adds &quot;we must have bright and productive young lady&#39;s at this school&quot; she says with an evil looking grin on her face.<br />
<br />
You nod to her and then take your leave heading to your new room to meet your new dorm mate. As you walk in you see your dorm mate already putting stuff away into the closet near her bed. When you come in she turns around and beams at you. Stopping what she is doing she turns around and says &quot;Hi, my name is Fiona Forrest, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you. What&#39;s yours if you don&#39;t mind me asking?&quot; You shake your head in response. &quot;Not at all&quot; you strain to say in your best female impression &quot;My name is Danni summers&quot; you tell her and her smile widens at this. &quot;That&#39;s a beautiful name&quot; she tells you &quot;well make yourself at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
You do just that as you begin putting your things away. Looking at your male clothes you decide to leave them in your luggage bag and slide it under your bed. Once you are done you sit down on your bed and your roommate joins you. She then talks with you about her home and why she decided to come to this college and you make up a story that seems believable. She smiles again and says &quot;I&#39;m so glad you are my roommate&quot; Just then The warning bell for first period rings and you both rush off to your respective classes. Your first class is the same as all the other students, Woman&#39;s education.</p>
