<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janace had recovered enough to explore, well not fully recover. She had decided to walk with Justin, Francine, and Nikole, Casey, like the younger sister shi is, had to tag along, leaving poor Ryles with the children.<br />
<br />
Justin was the first to speak up. &quot;So, Jan, did you find anything while on you trip?&quot; Shi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did. I found geothermal hot spots down there. I&#39;ll admit, I will miss the warmth, however, penguin flesh, not so much.&quot; She commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know you could&#39;ve fished, right?&quot; Nikole teased. &quot;So what&#39;s with the hot spots?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I found multiple. With the volcanoes at the cost, it&#39;s not very surprising.&quot; She looked. &quot;What?&quot; She said when she noticed all eyes were on her. Like Casey, she was a scientist, however where she was more of a geologist and Casey was more into the study of Space, that was where their differences were. But they both shared enough to know what the other was talking about.<br />
<br />
Casey looked at hir sister. &quot;You know, I think we sssshould take you to meet Mauriccce and Ssssnowy. Perhapsss they could give you a beautiful coat of fur.&quot; Shi smiled. &quot;Or glissstening set of gorgeous ssscales.&quot; Casey hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.... Casey, let Jan get used to us before she makes that choice.&quot; Justin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I....&quot; Shi tried to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casey, I know you want to help me, sis, but Justin is right. I have to adjust.&quot; She hugged her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. But it&#39;ssss nice to feel the sssun on your ssscales.&quot; Shi then looked up and rubbed hir head. Out of Nikole, Janace and hir, Shi used to be the one to worry about skin cancer from the sun, and now, shi had done a complete turn around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Case, I&#39;ll meet these two and see what I can become, okay?&quot; Janace giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooo.&quot; Casey smiled and ran ahead as Nikole giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful Janace, I think Casey has you in hir sneaky coils.&quot; Nikole responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Nikole. After a few moments I felt very much out of place anyway.&quot; She looked from her friend to the other two. &quot;And Justin, you know I still love you, and I wouldn&#39;t want anything but the best.&quot; She kissed her former husband on the cheek. &quot;At least we remain friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. And you know, you&#39;ll always be welcome in the palace.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Palace? Justin, we&#39;re not little kids.&quot; She looked. &quot;And you aren&#39;t Prince Charming.&quot; She was referring to the time when they were at prom.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but on the contrary, you see, France is no longer ran by a president. We actually entered a new era. I am her king and Francine is her queen. And many nations followed suit, well actually two so far, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s as infectious as the friendliness of the Chakats themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Egypt was one of them,&quot; came the voice of the former president of the nation. A jackat walked up, and at first Janace thought a moment this was one of those who hurt her little girl, but Nikole, at the relief of the jackat, calmed her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, shi wasn&#39;t one of them. Sally and, well actually Midnight dove down to defend hir mother and castrated both. As you can see, shi&#39;s still got hir male parts.&quot; Nikole pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see, in that case, forgive me sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite alright, miss... mi... uh....&quot; Shi started to stammer when shi saw Janace. Shi walked right up. &quot;Forgive me, but you have the precise beauty the manages to match that of the lovely Isis.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
Janace blushed a deep red, Justin having used Aphrodite instead, but still it caught her. &quot;Why thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime.&quot; The jackat walked off heading to do hir own thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jan, you know, to get a comment like that, at your age still, that is amazing. Now come.&quot; Shi walked towards the industries. &quot;This is Chakat Industries, or CI for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is where all this started?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this is where it all got improved.&quot; Nikole said. &quot;And I&#39;m sure you recall meeting Snowy, formerly known as Catherine Snow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikole, I&#39;m old, but I could still whip your ass. Cat went to school with us, remember? Her and Maurice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, Jan, it&#39;s hir now.&quot; Snowy came out, with Snowflake beside hir mother, Janice with Snowflake. &quot;And I&#39;m sure you met Janice, this here is hir best friend Snowflake, named after, well a combination of me and Flake. Hir sisters are over at the daycare with hir cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice nodded. &quot;May I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly. I presume you&#39;d like to become a kat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would, but I don&#39;t know, is it uncomfortable?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin chuckled. &quot;It&#39;d be the worst hour of your life, but after that, you&#39;ll find it was worth it. Your youth, which seems to never end, will come back. I talked to an old friend of mine, he was in his nineties and when I spoke with him, he was caught up in the Moscow incident, shi felt like shi was reborn at the right full age of thirty-five with the energy of a child. Now everyone is different on how they feel but that&#39;s what shi said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You talking about Markov, Justin?&quot; Janace smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one and the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy smiled. &quot;Come, Justin, I&#39;m sure me and Nikole can handle it from here, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ll be out here waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
NIkole looked. &quot;I know you probably want to get comfortable here, so it seems you&#39;re taking the first step in that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nikole, that&#39;s not why. I want the opportunity to catch up with my kids, grandkids, and great grandkids before I die. And now the opportunity has opened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy smiled. &quot;Well, then, let&#39;s figure which kat you&#39;ll like to become.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at all the various dna strands. &quot;Well, that&#39;s a lot.&quot; She commented.<br />
<br />
Snowy only giggled. &quot;You know, we do have a very special one for you.&quot; Shi walked over and grabbed a tube and handed it to Janace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? These are.... are...&quot; She looked up. &quot;They&#39;re are very few of these animals left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed there are. Infact there aren&#39;t anymore. They became kats, largely due to an accident.&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was due to a discovery made by me and my mate.&quot; Flake said coming up from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is interesting.&quot; Janace said. &quot;But a Minx strand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well actually that&#39;ssss mixed,&quot; Casey came forward. &quot;You sssssee, Ssssssnowy had allowed me to try ssssssomething. It&#39;ssss a mixture between a Minx, Alaskan wolf, and a....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually you&#39;re missing two Casey. Arctic fox and also a snow leopard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My four favorite animals, in one jar?&quot; Janace smiled. &quot;Can we... uh... use this on.... me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly, but there is no telling what the effects will do. However I would prefer your ribs to be fully recovered first.&quot; Snowy suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I want it now, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but you&#39;ll be in for twice the pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as long as I get to help spoil my grandchildren and great grandchildren, then so be it.&quot; Shi then looked at Nikole. &quot;So what happened to Charlie&#39;s father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming I found Brent in Italy, somewhere else. Last I knew he was on a fishing crew in Scandanavia. But seeing as he was with his whores, I could care less. Besides, I have one better, in your sweet daughter.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the rules I sat for Charlie apply to you, you break Jess&#39; heart, I rip yours out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... you do know that Kats have two hearts, right?&quot; Snowy giggled. &quot;So shi&#39;d still live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you have....&quot; Janace looked. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to examine your anatomy, Nikole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ll have your own to examine, Jan.&quot; Shi giggled before sticking Nikole with the needle she was looking at.<br />
<br />
&quot;In say an hour.&quot; Snowy said.<br />
<br />
The starting of the changes were instant. Janace felt a snap as her rib had popped into place. When she felt for her head, she could have sword her ears split three times as they migrated up. Each of her ears resembling the animals from which the stuff had in it. &quot;Oh dear, these will take some getting used to.&quot; Janace giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, now we can&#39;t whisper infront of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace giggled. &quot;Got that right, no more secrets.&quot; Her next change was evident as Nikole hurried to remove Janace&#39;s clothing. Fur had started to spread, considering it was animals that were white, the fur was dominantly white with a few grey spots here and there. From her ass, sprouted four tails, resembling of a wolf, fox, minx, and snow leopard. The next thing noticeable was Janace began to get taller as her feet adjusted. After a while she noted her ribs multiplied by two, the lower ones getting a bit bigger, as forelimbs grew out. Once they touched down, her body was now looking like a mix of the four animals, her face was the next to change. Canines pushed out as her face took on a canine feature, like Charlie, well also unlike Charlie, the feline side took her chest, and she grew three new sets of breasts. Janace looked down. &quot;Oh my.&quot; She blushed. The final sensation she had was a sheath grew, followed by a canine cock poking out, however, unlike most, her cock had barbs. The last thing that signaled the end was her spine popping. When done, Janace was now what they decided to lable as a Hybrikat, meaning a kat formed out of four or more animals. A temporary term until more were made of different species. Janace twitched her eight ears and smiled. &quot;I love it. Though did I really need to grow extra breasts?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikole giggled an tweeked one. &quot;They look hot on you. All the same size.. Oh wait, it goes from D, C, B, and A.&quot; She giggled poking in order from top to bottom as Janace&#39;s cock slid into its sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to show my girls.&quot; Janace giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;First here.&quot; Snowy handed hir a vest to try on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s so snug.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sexy too.&quot; Justin said walking in. &quot;My if Francine would allow I&#39;d take you back and have both, but I think I&#39;d get a headache.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine giggled. &quot;Oh I&#39;d so allow that. Then if you came home late you&#39;d have both of us to answer to.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks. I&#39;ll pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace giggled. &quot;Oh and you couldn&#39;t keep a secret from me, either.&quot; Shi points to her head.<br />
<br />
Justin finally noticed the four sets of ears and the four tails. &quot;My, so that&#39;s what you became.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.&quot; Shi smiled.</p>
