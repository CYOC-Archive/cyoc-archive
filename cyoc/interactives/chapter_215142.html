<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hello?” Shelby answered,<br />
“Is this Shelby Atlas?” The voice asked at the other end of the phone asked,<br />
“Um, yes. Yes it is,” Shelby replied,<br />
“We have been trying to reach you in search of possibly becoming a member of our young mothers committee,”<br />
“Y-young mothers?” Shelby said, confused, “sorry I don’t have any children,” she stated,<br />
“Would you consider becoming a mother?” The voice asked,<br />
“Excuse me?”<br />
“Would you consider becoming the mother of three children?”<br />
“What!?” Shelby said shocked, “I-I,”<br />
“Ma’am would you consider becoming the mother of three children at some point in the future?”<br />
“I-I… I guess… maybe, yeah,” she said, “I would be a mother but why does—”<br />
“Excellent,” the voice on the other end spoke.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Shelby felt a little dizzy. She took a deep breath before placing her hand on her hips, gaining her balance. As she looked down however, she noticed something odd… her usually toned and flat belly seemed to be protruding underneath her casual shirt. She didn’t think she’d get so bloated after that salad she’d eaten for lunch… but it didn’t feel like bloating. And bloating doesn’t continue growing!<br />
“AH!” She screamed as she lifted her shirt up, revealing her belly rising like bread in an oven, “oh my GOD!” She yelled. She placed her hand on her belly and felt some kind of movement from within. She pieced two-and-two together and recognised that this had to be something to do with the phone-call!<br />
<br />
“You BITCH! How have you done this!?” She yelled,<br />
“I’m sorry, is there some discomfort?” The voice asked,<br />
“DISCOMFORT!?” She yelled, “YOU PUT A BABY IN MY WOMB!”<br />
“More than one child,” the voice added, “you specifically stated you would be comfortable having triplets,”<br />
“Are you FUCKING kidding me!” Shelby yelled,<br />
“Can I offer you a more assisted pregnancy?” The voice asked,<br />
“A-assisted!?” Shelby said in disbelief as her belly continued to grow, arching her body forward, struggling to balance the weight, “what does that mean, and tell me really what it means!”<br />
“Our Assisted Pregnancy Program allows for a more comfortable and easy pregnancy. We can also offer and increase in Fertility and The Better-Than-Before Post-Pregnancy body,”<br />
“W-what does that even… I mean… wha…” Shelby continued to stammer, but as she arched her back it continued to hurt more and more, straining her small and frail body, “yeah, whatever makes this more comfortable, all of what you said… I think,”<br />
“Great,” the voice said.<br />
<br />
Shelby immediately felt the effects take place. She let out a deep refreshing breath as the pain seemed to subside. Then in a moment, she felt her hips crack. They widened in just a few seconds, allowing her body to distribute the added weight much better. As this was happened, she experienced an increase in muscle mass, causing her body to be able to support the weight much better, but then she underwent an even more dramatic weight increase, causing her thighs to thicken, her butt to plump, and her belly seemed to look a lot more natural on her now thick body. Her whole body had grown, including her face gaining just a few pounds.<br />
<br />
“I LOOK LIKE MY MOTHER!!” Shelby screamed, looking at herself in the mirror, “b-but fatter,”<br />
“Do not forget, you have accepted the Better-Than-Before Post-Pregnancy body,”<br />
“S-so I’ll… I’ll look better when I have to have these babies?”<br />
“Yes,”<br />
“S-so… can I ask some questions?” Shelby asked, still staring at herself,<br />
“Yes ma’am,”<br />
“W-when do I have to give birth to these three children?” She asked,<br />
“In exactly four months,”<br />
“S-so I’m not even at my largest size yet,”<br />
“I’m afraid not, however I can offer this one-time deal of a Motherly-Mammary Production PLUS (+),”<br />
“W-what does that do differently… and how does it make any difference,”<br />
“The MMP offer will give you and your children the most pleasure once they’ve been born,”<br />
“Pleasure?” Shelby asked,<br />
“Indeed. It doesn’t need to just be the children having ALL the fun,”<br />
“I-I guess… what-”<br />
“Amazing,” the voice said,<br />
<br />
“W-wait I didn’t agree yet!” She shouted. Suddenly her eyes rolled back and she moaned as her nipples darkened considerably, her areola growing larger as her breasts began to swell. They filled more and more with milk, growing more and more, bursting her shirt right open. By the time the ‘offer’ was done, her breasts were the size of watermelons,<br />
“HOW CAN I SERIOUSLY LIVE MY LIFE WITH THESE!?” She yelled into the phone,<br />
“We can also offer an unlimited supply of maternity clothes; including fitted bras, underwear, casual-wear, formal-wear,”<br />
“YES!” Shelby shouted, “ALL OF THAT!”<br />
“Done for you. The offer is a one-size-fits-all deal, so your body will need to adjust,”<br />
“Adjust… oh for gods sake,” Shelby said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her ass inflated, getting bigger and bubblier, sticking out like a shelf from her backside. It grew until it practically matched her giant breast with it’s size,<br />
“Please keep in mind your body will reduce once you have given birth,”<br />
“S-so I won’t be this big forever?”<br />
“Of course not,” the voice said, “unless you want it to,”<br />
“NO!” Shelby screamed.<br />
On top of her massively overinflated body, Shelby felt a tight yellow flowery dress appear. In all fairness, it covered her body perfectly and even complimented it. A maternity bra wrapped around her breasts and a well-fitted pair of panties sat themselves comfortably on her.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Great, that is all I have to offer today. Allow me to check if there is anything extra I can offer considering your circumstances,”<br />
“Nope!” Shelby said, “I don’t know how to deal with any of this… but this is clearly the best option I’ve got unless you can completely reverse all of this,”<br />
“I’m afraid I cannot undo any offers made, however I can offer you a Mothers-Mental-Mindset,”<br />
“Mothers what-now?”<br />
“Allow you to enjoy your changes. To make you a much more maternal personality. In my opinion, it will significantly improve your position,”<br />
“You know what… yeah. I’ll take the Mothers-Mental…mindset,” Shelby started, but quickly got dazed as her mind shifte, “oh my god… I’M GOING TO BE A MOTHER!” She cheered, “Thank you! Thank you so much! This is a DREAM COME TRUE!”<br />
“No need to thank me,” the voice said, “I must thank you,”<br />
“Okay bye bye now!” Shelby hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“Shit man,” the voice said, leaning back in her chair. She looked across the Infinite telemarketing office, seeing the array of cubicles, all featuring some kind of demon in each one,<br />
“How’s it going, Dee,” a voice asked beside her. Dee turned to face the familiar face of Mal, a grey demon with his tail wagging uncontrollably,<br />
“Pretty great!” Dee replied, “got my weekly quota in just one client!” She said excitedly,<br />
“Awesome! What kind,”<br />
“Mother,” Dee replied, looking rather proud of herself,<br />
“Wow and you got them to agree to more than just the babies!?”<br />
“Yep,” Dee said, “milky tits, massive ass, all of the best stuff,”<br />
“Even the lips!?”<br />
“Ah shit… not the lips,”<br />
“Ah man, that’s my favourite part,” Mal said, “but hey… guess we’re both done for the day,”<br />
“Seems like it,” Dee said with a smirk on her face, “how’s about we trade a couple changes and get me some of those fat lips you love,”<br />
“Sweet,” Mal said. He stood himself up, cracking his grey fingers, “mine or yours?”<br />
“Actually, I was thinking we hit the library,”<br />
“You really are in a good mood,” Mal flirted.<br />
<br />
The two walked out of their office and made their way to the library. Dee had her eyes on Mal’s clearly throbbing cock. Mal had his mind on the lips Dee was about to get that she could use it on it. Both of them were excited and horny, their tails wagging as they walked out of the infinite call-center.<br />
<br />
“How about we trade for something else,” Dee suggested,<br />
“Oh?”<br />
“You spend a little extra… you get the lips, and I get the cock!”</p>
