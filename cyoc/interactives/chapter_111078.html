<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">when they arrived to the kitchen, they kneeled and started looking for all the part of the broken eagle chain. it wasnt easy because Kyle and Josh tryed to reach diferent shatters at the same part which make them lose estability, but finding all of the peaces was easy since they got six eyes to look for them. They took all the pieces and put it on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so the chain fuses whoever has it, and by breaking it, nothing happened&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
&quot;but making more pieces to fuse more people into this familiy&quot; completed Kyle<br />
<br />
&quot;if we fix it, we might reduce the problem&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
&quot;Or we could go and see the guy who sold it to Kyle and find a solution&quot; comented Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats a good idea Josh, but you are forgetting something, we cant go outside like this&quot; said Kyle<br />
<br />
&quot;No Kyle, thaat might actually be a good idea, but we have to go when it gets dark&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we really going out like this? I mean look at us, dont you think someone will freak out dad?&quot; said Kyle<br />
<br />
&quot;Thas why we are going at night, when its dark and we are going by car&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
They didnt have to wait too long before the sunset, they took all of the eagle fragments in a plastic bag, and they slightly get out of the house into Owen&#39;s car.  kyle would be driving while Owen hit the gas and the break, and Josh had the gear shift. It actually wasnt hard since Owen managed the speed and Kyle knew where to go. in less than 10 minutes they were at the shop.The shop was closed but there was a light on a window at the upper floor. It was a two story building, the base floor belong to the shop and the second floor was the apartment where the owner lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;so this is where you got that thing, I ve never seen it before&quot; said Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Wel thats because it  just opened this week&quot; replied Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok that enough, we are talking to this person, Kyle open the door&quot; said Owen.<br />
<br />
They got out of the car and started knocking, at the door. &quot;the shop is closed!&quot; they heard tho owners yelling from the upper level. JOsh continued knocking the door, and Kyle shouted<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ehhh, excuse its me Kyle, the guy who bough the eagle chain&quot; <br />
<br />
inmediately the owner showed his head out of the window and saw teh family &quot;Hey look at you there, I though you might como soon or later, Ill be right ther in a minute&quot; he said and an instant later he was opening the main door of the shop. josh tried to reach his throat with his hand but since Owen didnt move, he couldnt get it. &quot;Wow take it easy, I though your friends birthday was in a couple of day, what happened with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;excuse me but can we have this talk inside?&quot; asked Owen<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, sure come on in&quot; said the owner and they walked inside. The owner of the shop leaded them to the upper part of the building where they saw a total mess. crates, bags, books... &quot;Sorry, I still haven&#39;t unpacked everything from the move, but have a seat, wherever you want, since you only need one&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, about that, thats what we wanted to talk about&quot; said Owen with calm <br />
<br />
&quot;thats what I though, but I expected to have this talk with Kyle and his friend in two days.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you knew this was going to happen? &quot;asked Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do, didnt I told you kyle?&quot; the owner said looking at Kyle<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think you missed that part&quot; replied Kyle<br />
<br />
&quot;oh well my mistake, you kind of forget things when you get my age, what happened? how did you got into this mess?<br />
<br />
&quot;you forgot?! how could you forget to say this kind of things, Igive you this pretty necklace oh and BTW it will fuse your body with whoever has the other part&quot; exclaimed Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh calm down, we&#39;re not here to fight but to find a solution&quot; said Owen. And teh trhee of them told the whole story to the shop owner<br />
&quot;... and we were hoping you could fix this&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kyle, didnt I told you? No refunds. No Returns. No exchanges. this is permanent, you will stay attached to your brother and father for the rest of your life&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but we cant stay like this, we all have different lives, and people would freak out when they see us&quot; said kyle<br />
&quot;you should have though of if before you left the necklace unwrapped. look at the bright side, you will be the closest family ever! you will have to buy less food, less clothes adn you wont have to go to school anymore since your father has already finished high school&quot; he said jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh let me strangle him, this is serious!&quot; said Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ill tell you what, because you were actually my first client, ill help wiht this, but I want to sent clear that even I own and create some of these artifacts, that eagle chain is not my work&quot; he said as he looked for something withing all the stuff he had. &quot;And I dont know how it actually works, i do have some potions, other medallions and spells but this in particular is one of the ones i found along history.. here it is!&quot; he said pickinf up a book.<br />
<br />
&quot;what is that? is that a magic book that will solve all of this?&quot; asked Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, or maybe not,  blah blah blah staff, blah tiara, blah blah ring.. twin eagle chain&quot; he said looking throughout the book &quot;A necklace created to solve problems between kingdoms by making their monarchs the closest friends ever.. shalala, all the problems dissapered a so both king did... and the twin eagles were lost in history... all set, theres no fixing it, you will be like this for ever&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This cant be, there might be another way, you said yourself that you have your own spells, cant you undo this?&quot;asked Owen<br />
<br />
&quot; Well I could do something, but, as I said, I didnt create this thing and I dont know how strong its magic is, plus I dont want an unwanted result, there could be something even worse&quot; said the owner<br />
<br />
&quot;who are you, or what are you?&quot; asked Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;well both questinons are hard to answer, I was born as a human but that was long ago now I dont really know if I could be considered mortal... who I am, well that changes with time, right now im just a man who comes from the south, owner of this shop and I go by the name of Sam Smith, it isnt one of my favorite names  but it was the first thing that came to my mind when I moved here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This has to be a dream, a real bad dream&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I dont think its a dream, or do you also share dreams? thats an interesting question, please tell me when you get the chance to experience dreaming&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ok and what do we do with this?&quot; asked kyle showing the fragments of the eagle chain<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh My God you broke it! well reverseable or not, that think should be whole, but I know how to help you!<br />
<br />
&quot;finally you got a slution&quot;say Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Well its a temporary solution that will work until you find out how to reverse it, it is an ilusion spell  that will make veryone else see you and dont freak out, it will make them think that you were always like this and tht it is completely normal&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;what kind of help is that?&quot;  josh<br />
<br />
&quot;well you would be able to be out in public and do your daily activities, or at least the activities of one of you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ok we&#39;ll take it&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
&quot;not so fast, thats fifteen bucks for the spell&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;what are you serious?&quot; exclaimed Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;well thats what i do for living these days, nothing is free in this life, leave it or take it&quot; said the shop owner<br />
<br />
&quot;we take it, Kyle take my wallet our of my pants&quot; said Owen<br />
<br />
when the shop owner got the money he just snapped his fingers and said it was done<br />
<br />
&quot;was that all? fifteen dollars for that?&quot; said Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Sam Smith<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok thank you, if you find a way to reverse this please let us know&quot; said Owen before Josh did another comment. they left the building drove back home and the three of them felt asleep on t he couch.</p>
