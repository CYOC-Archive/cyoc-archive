<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan started rubbing Jake&#39;s head with his thumb.  Cats like being pet.  Surely a human who got turned into cat would like being pet, especially when that cat is also now his penis.  Sure enough, Jake started purring.  Was actually a pretty strange experience, feeling his penis purr.<br />
<br />
Jake had startled himself when he started purring.  As a human, that was not something he ever thought he&#39;d ever get to do.  But, deciding it was pretty neat, he allowed himself to continue purring, closing his eyes.  He was still mad at his friend for turning him into a cock of all things, but he had to admit, he was kinda enjoying this.  His friend&#39;s giant handpaw wrapped around him, thumb rubbing his head.  It was feeling rather pleasant.  Almost like...<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes shot open, and he began struggling in Nathan&#39;s handpaw.  &quot;Nope, no no no!  You are not using ME to masturbate!  Especially not in MY basement!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan let go.  &quot;Sorry, dude.  I was hoping to maybe show you that being a penis might not be so bad.  You gotta admit, you were enjoying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake considered lying, but figured that Nathan probably felt his purring.  &quot;Yeah, okay, maybe, but... can we not make this so weird?  I mean, I only turned you into a dog.  You actually seemed to like that, too.  Why punish me like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.  Power abuse, I guess.  And, I&#39;ve been interested in this sort of thing for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, people turning into dicks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, kinda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s weird.  But why didn&#39;t you just turn yourself into a dick?  Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you already turned me into a dog.  It was your turn to get transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could&#39;ve become a dog dick on your next turn, you know.  Instead, you had to make me your guinea pig.  And now I&#39;m stuck like this until tomorrow morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan briefly considered a guinea pig transformation before responding.  &quot;Yeah, okay, you&#39;re right.  I&#39;m sorry.  If it helps you feel better, I&#39;ll let you turn me into one of your body parts tomorrow morning.  But hey, look on the bright side!  It&#39;s only until morning!  And how many people get to say they got to experience life as a dude&#39;s penis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake grumbled under his breath (which sounded cute with his small voice), &quot;How many people want to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, we&#39;re both stuck like this, for now.  Let&#39;s just enjoy the night like this.&quot;  Nathan powered down Jake&#39;s laptop and brought it upstairs, along with the Chronivac emitter.  Jake sunk partway back into Nathan&#39;s sheath.  Jake didn&#39;t like the idea of being along for the ride, like this, but at least it was a comfortable ride.<br />
<br />
From there, Jake and Nathan played some video games.  Or rather, Nathan did.  Despite their best efforts, they couldn&#39;t find a convenient way to allow the penis-sized cat to use a game controller.  So Jake just watched Nathan play.  He was surrounded by Nathan&#39;s furry legs, and the controller loomed above him, but he at least had a clear view of the TV, so long as Nathan kept his legs open.  Soon, though, Jake became distracted by those legs.  When Nathan first turned into a German shepherd, he noted how soft and huggable Nathan looked.  Reaching out a hand, he began to stroke the fur of Nathan&#39;s leg.  Despite his smaller size and his permanently affixed location, Nathan&#39;s leg still felt soft.  Perhaps even cushier than it would&#39;ve been had Jake still been a full-sized person.  Granted, Jake wouldn&#39;t have originally pet Nathan so close to his junk.  But, when he IS that junk...<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you petting me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake quickly stopped.  &quot;What?  No!  I mean... wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t stop on my account.  It feels weird having my penis pet my leg, but I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake was about to come back with a retort, but decided there was no point, and just continued petting Nathan&#39;s inner thigh.<br />
<br />
Later that evening, Nathan had ordered pizza (with his money, of course).  The delivery guy was a bit bewildered at the appearance of a 6-foot anthropomorphic German shepherd answering the door, so much so that he didn&#39;t even notice that the German shepherd&#39;s penis was a sphynx cat.  But the delivery guy recomposed himself, and traded the pizza for the money.  Nathan quickly shut the door as the the delivery guy pulled out his phone to take a picture.  Don&#39;t need that sort of trouble!<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let me have a piece!&quot;  The sphynx cat/penis called up to the German Shepherd hogging the pizza.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that penises eat.  Are you even hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I know how tasty pizza is.  Come on, I won&#39;t eat much!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Nathan tore a small piece off the pizza, and handed it to his friend-turned-penis.  Though they had ordered thin-crust, it might as well have been a deep dish pizza to the small feline.  He took a bite, and started chewing.  To Nathan, this was probably the strangest sensation, so far, having his penis chew on food.  For Jake, though, it was a bit of a struggle.  After a minute, though, Jake spit the bite back out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?  Doesn&#39;t taste good?  Not as good to me, either.  I think I heard dogs don&#39;t have as many taste buds as humans do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can&#39;t swallow.  In fact, I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;ve swallowed once since I became a dick.  I don&#39;t think I even have any spit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense.  Like I said, penises don&#39;t eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;d better save some for me!  I want some after I change back to normal!&quot;<br />
<br />
The inability to eat his favorite foods was definitely a disappointment for Jake.  But Nathan also learned that having a dog face made eating a little complicated.  He couldn&#39;t chew his food as quietly as with a human mouth.  He also quickly learned that drinking soda out of a bottle was very difficult (much to Jake&#39;s annoyance, as he found soda splashing down on his head), instead having to lap it up out of a glass with his tongue.<br />
<br />
Although the evening had started out stressful between the two, they found themselves more relaxed by the end of the evening, thanks to a lousy movie they could make fun of together.  Yes, even Jake was more at ease about having become Nathan&#39;s penis.</p>
