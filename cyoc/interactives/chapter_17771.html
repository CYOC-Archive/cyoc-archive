<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna heard the name said but it meant nothing to a girl of her age except to find she was as much a part of Circe as she was of herself. A few feable tries to remove the ring had the voice ringing in her head to stop and let Circe show her the meaning of fun.<br />
<br />
Ken was Anna's older brother by some years. A fun loving boy but often cruel to his little sister like most siblings are! It might be her birthday but no matter what he felt it was always open season on Anna.<br />
<br />
Gifts all given and the party over as guests and family began to leave it was Ken's time to make his sister's life a bit of hell. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice birthday Siss?&quot; asked Ken his tone of voice telling Anna there was something brewing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go away I'm enjoying today and don't need you nasty jokes!&quot; grumbled Anna to Ken.<br />
<br />
As Anna turned to walk away one of her party balloons now filled with water dropped on her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, you look like a drowned cat!&quot; chuckled Ken as he taunted and pointed at his drenched sister.<br />
<br />
Anna stood there out on the front lawn her eyes welling up tears, while from deep within her mind came that bold voice of Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Men, and he is a man, you know what he deserves, we don't get mad, we get even!&quot; suggested Circe to Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, your all wet! Now all you need is some dirt on your head and you'll look just like the little sister I know!&quot; taunted ken as down over Anna's now wet hair he poured a handful of Mom's potting soil.<br />
<br />
Anna screamed getting more angry by the second. Circe was working her ideas as well suggesting for to get even with her brother by means of the ring's power.<br />
<br />
Ken seeing he was getting her good and mad now grabbed her about the waist, and holding her upside down he started to shake her around. Laughing in his own nasty way Ken was ready to let his sister know who was her boss.<br />
<br />
Screaming bloody murder it was their Father who came out of the house and cuffed Ken upside his dumb head. The hit made Ken drop Anna who landed on the green grass making grass stains on her new party dress.<br />
<br />
Wet, soiled, and grass stained her dress and Anna for that matter was fit to be tied. Her face and eyes told of just how angered a little girl can get. As she stood there brushing off her messed up dress and hearing Ken try to lie his way out of a thrashing from Father, Circe began again to suggest that Anna use the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now give your nice sister and friendly hug and ask her to forgive you!&quot; demanded Father.<br />
<br />
That same old evil sneer on his face Ken leaned forward and gave a bear hug to his sister. &quot;You'll forgive me won't you Sis&quot; then very softly he said into her ear, &quot;Or things will get worse and worse!&quot; said Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it, I'll help you he's right for it and when you Father leaves Ken will feel your new power over him, do it, go on do it!&quot; taunted Circe to suggest Anna use the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive you for being a brother I do! Now except my good wishes for you!&quot; said Anna as then in her sweet and soft voice she said into Ken's left ear, &quot;You made a pig out of me but that is far too good for the likes of you, I wish for you to be the dirty dog you are!&quot; blessed Anna to her dear brother.<br />
<br />
Their Father seeing them make up turned around and went back to helping his good wife clean up after the party. Ken hearing his sister  curse him like that stepped back and away from her.<br />
<br />
Ken looked at his weak sissy sister seeing now her eyes almost glowing and burning with hatred for him. Her face told just how determined she was in plans to get even, a plan he was soon to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down Sis, you know I'm top dog around here!&quot; said Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog yes but what kind of dog are you, brother?&quot; asked Anna giving Ken the right to name his own new self.<br />
<br />
Ken looked at her seeing the steam coming out her tiny soft ears. He needed a crusher, a dog type to show he she was just his puny little sister and he, Ken was her better!<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm an alpha male Malmute, if you can't run with a big dog then stay on the porch!&quot; said Ken with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Anna mad as mad could be for one so young just pointed her ringed finger at Ken stepping forward till he let her touch his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Malemute then you are, black as night, eyes bright blue, and something so cowardly that you'll run from other's like you in fear!&quot; cursed Anna but it was the words coming from that well learned witch, Circe.<br />
<br />
Anna stood her ground as Ken felt a burning sensation on the end of his nose.<br />
<br />
Jerking his head back he toppled over backwards and fell on his back.<br />
<br />
The sensation was spreading through him and a fear of what Anna had done made his bold heart melt. Shaking of fear and feeling his arms and legs grow limp and almost numb he tried to speak, begging for help.<br />
<br />
Standing over her prey like some cat ready to taunt it to death, Anna and circe looked down at Ken. Anna opened her fingers wide and passing them in the air over the top of Ken laying on the ground she spoke Circe's wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the ground is where ye shall lay, a dog you are by night and day, here to be for all to see, a Malmute dog for an eternity!&quot; spelled Circe to Ken.<br />
<br />
Stepping to stand over him she straddled Anna's legs on to each side of Ken's chest. Then bending at the waist she reached the ring finger out and with it's golden metal touched again his now very black nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Malmute dog in body and form but the memories and knowledge of the male human you were now locked and bound to see, hear, and understand that Anna is your master. Dog you are the way you live but when night falls you can think of what you are, what you have done, and know that women are your downfall!&quot; said Circe telling Ken what to expect.<br />
<br />
Ken began to feel himself going into some sort of muscular convulsions. He shook all over his arms were getting thinner but remained long. He felt his balls and penis snarled into a tight knot as the gut ached from change.<br />
<br />
Groaning softly his voice was changing to one of a single tone. It was the sensing of his fingernail becoming claws that told him the Malmute he said he was over Anna, was to be the self and body he was to know.<br />
<br />
Barking his feelings of pain as tail erupted from a now black furry butt. Legs cramped making Ken double up in pains as his front paws were not made now to rub and massage away his agony.<br />
<br />
The stretching of his nose and skull made the big Malmute howl like some mad wolf. He howled and called out like Malmutes and wolves do near sundown. <br />
<br />
Breathing in and out in harsh quick breaths, tongue now long and pink it hung out his mouth as Ken panted. The large dog weighing the same was was what Ken had he got up and stood for the first time on all real four legs.<br />
<br />
A doggy shake of his thick furry body ran from head out to the end of his long tail.<br />
<br />
Now he thought of what had happened and he stepped to Anna as the big dog burried his head into her tummy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late to plead for mercy male dog! Your sister's anger gave me power again and you made the suggestion as I made you the dog you are! Now begin to be a dog, sniff for scents, feel that male urge to procreate, and enjoy cleaning your body with a long wet tongue!&quot; said Circe through Anna as Ken felt the new urges charge through his new body.</p>
