<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin walked home, naked as a jaybird. Ty was to busy changing everyone in school. He didn&#39;t care anymore. <br />
There was nothing he could do anyway. There was nothing anyone could do actually. His parents were transformed into a piece of fabric, his friends were a freakish human chimera that not being gay it was unable to relate to. He just wanted to go home, go to his room, get under the covers and sob into sleep while Ty had his fun and decided to torture him more. Even when not even he knew what else could Ty do to him.<br />
<br />
He just walked. And walked until he finally reach his house, a small satisfaction. When he was about to enter however. Two bright lights descended from the sky and took the form of spheres of smoke. The spheres started to circle him. He wasn&#39;t going to get scared for this, but the new attempt of his brother for torture was more of an annoyance than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty! Just stop it OK! You have already taken everything I care about! You won!&quot;<br />
<br />
The spheres step back, but stood floating close to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings mortal. You seem to be aware of our existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut it out, Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid he can&#39;t do that, mortal.&quot; spoked the other spheres.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, it would be best if we tried to explain ourselves.&quot; add the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if we undo some of the damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the spheres started to circle around Dustin again, but this time he felt refreshed, cleanse in a way. He felt how his body started to grow, grow back to his old self, his true self. Fabric began to materialize on his body an soon he was dress in his normal clothes. The spheres had turned him back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human, make no mistake, this is no the doing of the one you call Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; inquired Dustin, somehow a little more trusty of these spheres.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may call use Spirituals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are born of the collective emotions of the people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are in charge of making people to emote positively.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are able of many things in your world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now we are the cause of this disaster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you&#39;re the source of Ty power. You gave him those powers. Do you have any idea of what have you done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s you who doesn&#39;t have idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me explain: We are born on the energy of the sentient beings, both positive and negative, while a balance is maintained we exist in harmony. Our sole purpose is that, on to achieve that purpose we make small alterations to your world. We are known by humans like you as luck, karma, dharma, curse or blessings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But as you, we are also living beings and everything that lives, shall die. That&#39;s the rule that no one can break. And just like you we are born, we learn our purpose, we learn how to achieve it, we accomplish our goals and then we also fade away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so one of our young ones was trying to revert a negative flux that came from that mortal Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mortal had only one wish in his heart, to things to change from his current state. And so the young one granted his wish a little more than ten years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten years ago... that&#39;s when Ty was adopted. Now I remember, him always whining about how crappy his life was in there. Maybe I should have been nicer after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes his wish was granted that day. But it was blunt. The wish did not change his situation, instead the wish granted him the power to CHANGE. Slowly gaining strength to manifest itself like it has done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of our most powerful and dangerous powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me. My parents are fucking pieces of fabric.&quot; remembering what Ty had done just a while ago, his horrible past no withstanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said mortal. You do not understand yet. Our mission is to balance the positive and negative energies of all sentient beings on this planet, and your specie is foolish enough not to realize that the planet itself is a sentient being also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mortal Ty is tampering with this power not realizing that he is throwing the balance. The amount of negativity he is expending is unheard on the many millenia of our duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our kind is doing what is capable to maintain the balance, but the longer this continue the weaker we get, and soon we shall too fade away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then the planet itself will try to purge the negative forces, but that mortal will mean the end of your kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? He is actually jump-starting the fucking apocalypse!, Well you gave him his powers, can&#39;t you take them away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He may not know of our existence but his actions has shield him from us. Somehow, the only humans that are aware of the imbalance are you and the mortal Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wished that only he and me would be aware of the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s explain why you alone of all the mortal we have found is aware of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must make him stop then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? He&#39;ll never listen to me, he&#39;ll call me envious or something like that, or worse change me into who knows what. He is aware of you also right?,  make him enter in reason, before he destroys the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like we said the balance is already perturbed. We derive our strength of the forces, and so does Ty, but while we become weaker, he just become more wicked the more he use them. He would not stop from his own accord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And such you alone can stop him now. I am the one who granted his original wish and since you are the only mind not corrupted by him I will also grant you the powers he has. But to prevent the unbalance to worsen, your powers will only work if you use them against the mortal Ty. I will give you myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortal do you accept?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To have the power to beat that bastard, am in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortal what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortal Dustin I grant you the power of CHANGE.&quot;<br />
<br />
As one the spheres fade away into nothing, he felt a rush of energy coming from within. he felt he could do anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortal Dustin, I warn you your powers are just as strong as his are. Yet you must stop him or your kind will be doom. Now I will join my brothers in their effort. Be brave mortal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin knew what he need to do. And he Could do something about it.</p>
