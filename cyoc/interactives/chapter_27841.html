<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Am I in heaven?&quot; Cody thought. All he could see was a blinding light as it slowly started to . He started to lose consciousness. And all went to black again.<br />
<br />
Crack! crack! The sound of twigs snaping flouded Cody's ears and awoke him with a start. His head was throbbing and he reached back behind his head to find a patch of dried blood. &quot;Oooo...&quot; Cody groaned with pain. His hand came down on a soft wet substance and he glanced down. He couldn't really see but he could tell he was lying on a bed of moss or some kind of grass. &quot;What... who?&quot; Cody said out loud, but before he could say another word he was interupted by a low growl. To Cody's surprise it was comforting. His vision was very blurry but was slowly coming to foccus. trees started apearing before him as brown blurry sticks. He quickly sat up and did a 180 degree turn on his knees and saw a big brown round blob next to what seemed to be the creek he fell into.<br />
<br />
Finally everything came into foccus and a grizzly bear was now standing before him where the big brown blob was. He stared at the bear for what seemed like hours, It looked as if the bear was just sitting there staring at it's reflection, just staring almost as if it was watching, waiting for something to happen. He had the sudden urge to go over to the creek and sit next to the bear. It was difficult to explain, but to Cody it seemed that the bear was friendly. As Cody got up, a slight wave of dizzyness hit him and he stumbled and caught himself from falling. The bear must have heard that but the bear didn't even move. As Cody approached the back of the bear Cody could not imagine what he was seeing. As he was walking towards the bear he saw that it was transforming. <br />
<br />
The Bear's front paws started changing into what looked like a human hand but with only four fingers with black claws. It's back paws formed into 4 toed, what looked like to be, human feet more than paws. Cody heard the bears back starting to crack and the bear's back straightened. The bear's muscles became more defined and it stood up on it's hind legs on the balls of it's feet. The bear transformed into an anthro bear. <br />
<br />
Cody was still facing the bears back when it twitched its stubby tail and turned around. Cody was shocked to see the 6'2&quot; anthro bear's fury body. Cody's eyes wondered down to the bears feet up it's legs and noticed his fur covered balls and sheath. As Cody's eyes traveled up the bear's fury body he noticed that the anthro bear had tears in his eyes.<br />
<br />
All of the sudden the bear lunged forward and embrassed Cody in a gental but firm hug as the bear began crying even more. After a few minutes, the bear let go of Cody who was frozen solid in shock. &quot;Cody! Cody it's me! Jack!&quot; Shouted the bear and with a thud Cody passed out and last thing he saw was the bear catching him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh&quot; Cody mumbled as he slowly woke up. &quot;Here... eat this.&quot; Jack demanded. Cody obeyed still half asleep as he bit into the sweet and sour taste of fresh raspberries. He then sat up in a jolt remembering what happened like a sack full of bricks. &quot;Jack! Is that really you?!?! What the hell happened to you?&quot; Cody said in shock. Tears began to well up on the corners of Jack's eyes and drip down his furry face. Jack wiped his black wet nose on his muzzle with his four fingered hand and said &quot;I don't know, I just became like this after i went swimming in this small lake I found. I can't go back like this! I am an animal now! A wild beast!&quot;. &quot;But you have to come back, everyone thinks you are dead, but i knew you had to be out there somewhere so i came looking for you.&quot; Cody explained &quot;Plus you do look kinda cute as a bear&quot; Cody joked as he rubbed the top of jacks head. &quot;You really think this is a good look?&quot; Jack began to chear up a bit and they both began to chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So can you always changed back and forth from this to a bear?&quot; Cody asked. &quot;Well yeah, I just figured it out by concentrating really hard on what i want to be. But I already tried being back to normal but i always come to a stop with this form&quot;. It was getting dark while Jack and Cody continued their conversation so they decided to make a fort to stay in over night.<br />
<br />
Jack had always been fond of Cody, and vice versa. Cody always had a slight crush on Jack but didn't know if Jack felt the same way but the thing was that Jack was in the same position as Cody. Jack met Cody at school about a year ago. They sat next to each other in math and also swam on the swim team so they quickly became best friends. Jack was about the same height as Cody and had short blonde hair and greenish blueish eyes. They lived down the street from eachother and they would see eachother everyday so their friendship grew until the day Jack disappeared in the woods.<br />
<br />
As the moon krept just above the trees it started to get really cold and Cody began to shiver. Jack noticed how cold Cody was so they began to snuggle keeping really close for warmth. It wasn't until half way through the night Jack noticed that Cody started to gently rub his hand on Jack's sheath. For Jack, his newly formed dick was very exotic, even having a sheath was very arousing let alone being covered with fur. &quot;Cody...?&quot; Jack whispered, thinking maybe it was a dream or maybe that Cody was dreaming but Cody responded with a silent &quot;Mhm&quot; and he kept rubbing. Slowly Jack's dick began to slide out of it's sheath as Cody began to message Jack's furry balls. Finally they could both express their feelings for eachother, and tonight was the perfect night to do so. As Jack's dick worked it's way out, Cody could feel that his dick was not much different than his except for the tip of Jack's dick was more coned shaped but just a little and the size of his dick must have been at least 10 inches long and just a bit fatter than Cody's. Cody was so turned on by this that Cody started to rub his now hard dick against Jack's furry belly looking for an opening to stick it in. Jack then whispered &quot;You know I just got the special place for your dick&quot;, And with that Jack grabbed Cody and put him right in front of him as Jack sat up and lifted his ball sack. To Cody's surprise there was a pussy hidden just bellow Jack's ball sack wet and ready. Without hesitation Cody slipped his dick into Jack's new grown pussy and together they had a night of pleasuring eachother.<br />
<br />
In the morning Cody found himself snuggling with jack still and was pondering on whether the events that took place the night before were real or just a dream. But Cody didn't care, if it was a dream then it would have been the best wet dream he had ever had. With a tight squeeze Cody gave jack a quick hug waking him up. Smiling jack held Cody closer and together sat up. &quot;So how did you enjoy last night?&quot; Jack asked a little nervous for the response. &quot;That was all real and not just a dream?&quot; Cody thought to himself and responded with a smile and a quick &quot;excellent&quot;. &quot;So how did you get a pussy?&quot; Cody asked with embarrassment and without thinking. Jack could feal himself get red, thank god he had fur. &quot;Well I got it when i went swimming in that damn lake. I think I got it because i was thinking about girls and how it must feel to have a pussy when i saw a bear across from me on the lake and thats when the change began. And I think thats how I came out like this.&quot; Jack pointed at himself and then lifted his ball sack and showed him his pussy. Cody shivered in pleasure at the sight of Jack's new form.<br />
 <br />
Later during the day after eating wild berries Jack decided to ask Cody if he wanted to see the lake. &quot;That would be exciting! I want to see it!&quot; Cody responded with enthusiasm. So they began walking about a mile when they came upon the clearing with high grass and sparkling blue water as the sunlight danced on the surface of the water. &quot;So here it is.&quot; Jack paused for a minute. &quot;I've been thinking alot Cody, and to tell you the truth i was wondering if you wanted to join me out here in the wilderness as my mate. All you have to do is jump in the lake and think about what kind of animal you want to be.&quot; Cody fell silent and thought for a minute and then with a smile he responded with a shout &quot;Of course!.&quot;. And without thinking twice Cody head first into the crystal blue water.</p>
