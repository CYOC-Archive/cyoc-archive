<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>As Rick and Brendon looked out onto the street, along with the surrounding area, 
they noticed that only men were around. Men of different ages, walking together: some 
were holding hands, a few others Brendon's age made out with each other. Seeing this 
made you wonder what the fog did to reality. They continued looking around while 
aimlessly wandering onto the sidewalk just to see how far this change had gone. All 
throughout the neighborhood they once knew, things were different everywhere. Rick and 
Brendon looked at each other with confusion as well as astonishment, wondering if the 
pink fog affected the entire world. To this, they were just about to run into the house and 
look on television or even search the internet for any signs of women at all. Just when they 
turned their backs and they were about to go in the house, they both felt a singular and 
meaty hand grasp each of their shoulders. Not wanting to be rude, the two stopped and 
turned around.</Br>
<Br>Much to their surprise, the man who grabbed them was Chuck, one of Rick's best 
buddies in the neighborhood. Surely he would know what was going on, since he was 
married to one of the most beautiful women either of them had seen, excluding Tabitha. 
Chuck was a rugged, man's man who was six foot tall, well built which made both Rick 
and Brendon jealous. One thing that Rick knew about Chuck, that Brendon didn't, was the 
fact that Chuck was also very well endowed. Chuck only knew because of one time they 
were at the gym and both were naked in the men's locker room. During this time, after 
their paired workout, Chuck was hard as a rock for some reason and Rick couldn't help 
seeing the thing. Rick knew that Chuck's wife must have been one happy lady.</Br>
<Br>"Hey Chuck" Rick said with a smile, "do you know what is going on around here?
"</Br>
<Br>Chuck just looked at Rick confused. "Um Rick... you feeling okay? What do you mean 
about 'what's going on around here'? Life is how it has been for quite some time."</Br>
<Br>"Um... I don;t think so buddy. Where is your wife and do you know what happened 
to... to my... um... wife?"</Br>
<Br>Concerned that you were coming down with something, Chuck placed his hand on 
your forehead, checking to see if you were coming down with a fever. "My wife, your wife... 
neither of us have a wife Rick."</Br>
<Br>For a second, Rick scratched his head, but then when he tried to recall imagery of 
her, there was only images of him being with Chuck. In fact, he thoughts went from 
thinking about this woman, to thinking only about Chuck. To Rick, just like with Chuck, all 
knowledge of this supposed opposite sex existed. Suddenly, a strange chill overcame Rick 
as he shuddered a bit. Concerned for Rick, Chuck embraced him in a light hug, as if to 
warm Rick up.</Br>
<Br>"Rick, are you feeling okay. Twice now you have given me cause for alarm."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I am just fine... especially now with your arms around me like when we are in 
bed together."</Br>
<Br>At first, Brendan was shocked by seeing Rick hugging another man and peering into 
Chuck's eyes with a deep gaze of love. However, just like Rick, that changed as Brendon 
could no longer recall anyone else being in Rick's life. At the same time Brendon's mental 
switch clicked over, a very manly guy Brendan's age walked over to him and planted a 
deep and lust-filled kiss on Brendon, which he accepted openly. The younger man, who 
was now done making out with Brendon, was Johnny (which was what he liked being 
called). In Brendon's mind, he and Johnny had been going out for quite some time and they 
both have formed a deep bond with one another. Like Chuck, Johnny was ruggedly 
handsome, with big muscles, thick hair on all the normal places expect where Johnny 
groomed himself since he didn't like hair on his back or crotch. Brendon his hard hand on 
Johnny's face with a soft and loving touch.</Br>
<Br>"Hi Johnny, I missed you too!" Brendon's gaze went deeper, "you really know how to 
turn me on! Your stubbled face always gets my motor running when we kiss."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I know... that's why I keep it this way." He finished saying with a wide 
grin.</Br>
<Br>Seeing the look on the younger couple's faces, Chuck smiled since he and Rick both 
had the same look. "Hey you two, why don't you go back inside and get comfortable. Rick 
and I will go back to my place and we will do the same."</Br>
<Br>"Sounds like a plan Chuck! Me and Brendon are just going to 'hang out' in his 
place."</Br>
<Br>Chuck, Rick, Johnny and Brendon all chuckled amongst themselves, knowing what 
each had meant. As the two couples parted ways, Chuck wrapped his arm around Rick in a 
tight sideways embrace, while Johnny positioned his meaty hand so he could grasp 
Brendon's buttocks when he felt like it. What none of them noticed, since all of their minds 
thought the same way, was all of their ears were starting to elongate to a point.</Br>
<Br>Now that the two couples have broken up, who are we going to follow?</Br></p>
