<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I know last chapter was third person, but every chapter before then was second, so...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It dawns on you that in a single moment, you&#39;ve seemingly erased everyone...  Every human identity gone, in an instant, replaced by nameless grey creatures that followed your every command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a downer,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice rings in your head.  &quot;They&#39;ll follow any command, including going back to their boring, normal selves, the minute you ask.  With one sentence, you could set everyone back to exactly how it was before, and leave it like that forever, and let life go on in the same boring, depressing way it always had.  OR… you could take advantage of your blank canvas.  If it helps, just remember; the universe is constantly splitting into new timelines.  In a world where you refused the ring, things are going the same as that always have.  Think about this as a new universe, with new people where every soul is eager to serve you.  These aren’t the people you once knew; they’re lumps of clay waiting for you to give them shape.”<br />
<br />
Your hesitance fades slightly.  Perhaps she’s right.  While you’re nervous about the idea of ruling the world, and potentially messing things up, fantasies you once thought impossible begin to dance in your head.  <br />
<br />
There’s no harm in indulging a little, right?  After all, if you truly regret it, you can just set things back.  And it’s better than leaving everyone blank, identical nothings like this.  And you’ve always enjoyed transformations of all sorts.<br />
<br />
You finally speak, raising your finger and pointing to the creature in front of you.  “Unit, I instruct you to become an outgoing, busty, nine-tailed fox woman, named… uh… Gwen!  Who’s loyal and loving to me, and can do cool magic.”<br />
<br />
The creature nodded.  “Yes Master!”   And within moments, the creature began to grow bright red fur, its hips swelling to child-bearing proportions, while its waist narrowed.  Rounded, fatty lumps bubbled up on both its chest and its rear, her new breasts becoming larger than your head. Her body grows taller, coming just up to six feet  Pink nipples and a vaginal slit interrupted the growing red fur, while her thighs became thicker.  <br />
<br />
Starting at her knees and elbows, the fur spreading over her form became black, while her fingers and toes both grew thicker, little claws sprouting from the tips of her fingers and toes, while leathery pads pushed up from the palms, soles, and digits.  Her feet reshaped more dramatically, becoming longer, digitigrad, and her toes repositioning to mimic the paws of a fox.<br />
<br />
Behind her, one strand shot out above her butt, then another, then another, each new appendage rapidly getting covered in extra fluffy red fur, with a white tip.  Her grey eyes turned a vibrant orange, while her nose turned black and wet, nostrils growing wider while her jaw grew out into a vulpine snout filled with fangs.  Black hair draped down from her head, all the way to her tails, and her fur-covered ears slowly moved up through it, turning triangular as they did so, becoming able to shift in the direction of any sound she heard.  <br />
<br />
She blinks a few times, as thoughts of her own, guided by the personality you gave her, flow into her mind.<br />
<br />
With a sudden grin, she turns to you, and hugs your face into her soft, fluffy chest, letting her tails wrap around and hug you as well.  “Thanks for this beautiful form and mind, Master!  Or do you prefer Evan?”  She leans down and kisses you on the lips.  “It’s so great to officially be a part of your world!  Anything I can do for you, love?  Or do you have other things you want to change first?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NEW CHAPTER:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After seeing something like that actually work, you felt curious about if your power might work on other things, as well.  Figuring it wouldn’t hurt to give it a try, you turned your attention to the empty school bus.<br />
<br />
“This bus will become a sports car,” You said, pointing to it with the hand the ring is on.<br />
<br />
The only thing that happened was Gwen and Bitzy looking at you in confusion.<br />
<br />
After a moment of awkward silence, one of the lined up units spoke.<br />
<br />
“That bus is not a transformed unit, Master,” is said.  “However, if you wish, one of us can become a sports car, or can become things capable of rebuilding or transforming that bus into a sports car.  The unit you call Gwen is already capable of it, if you wish.”<br />
<br />
“Shall I, Master?”  Gwen asked.<br />
<br />
“No, no,” you said, “I was just experimenting.  That said...” you look back at the unit that had spoken.  “Unit, turn this bus into a sports car, and do it quick.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master.”  The unit immediately began to reshape, its waist pinching inward and its hips and chest flaring into an exaggerated hourglass figure.  The unit began to float off the ground, its legs seemingly dissolving into a wispy tail of deep blue smoke.  Soft, brown fur grew from its gray, incomplete form, covering it’s upper body, arms, and head almost completely.  A short, fluffy tail popped up like a spring just above the point its lower body turned to smoke.  Its face grew a few inches longer, the nostrils splitting and becoming a rabbit’s twitchy nose.  It’s eyes turned a bright blue, and a stream of long hair in the same color flowed out of its head behind it.  Accompanying the hair were a pair of long, thin ears, which flopped down to the sides of its body.<br />
<br />
The unit turned rabbit-genie was then clad in a pair of gold cuffs on her wrists, with a golden band tying her hair into a ponytail. Below its wispy tail, a bottle formed of blue crystal appeared. Her eyes and hands both began to glow, as the empty bus lifted up, it’s metal noiselessly crunching and twisting, pressing down into a low, streamlined car, its paint turning bright red.<br />
<br />
“It is done, Master,” she said emotionlessly, before her change started to revert.<br />
<br />
“Wait, wait, stay like you were!”  You say quickly.  “That genie form was cool.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, Master.”  The genie’s smoky tail reversed its solidification into legs. <br />
<br />
“Great,” you say, “now we just need to give you a name and personality....  Unit, your name is…  Phedra.  You will take on a personality fitting a loyal, obedient genie.”  You pause, thinking of your previous attempt to make units into goddesses.  “If you have the power to do so, you’ll also be put in charge of ensuring the moon will always stay in orbit, and the tides remain, to help my world last forever.”<br />
<br />
“As you wish, Master.”  The unit’s countenance changed, no longer emotionless, it seemed to carry itself with a sense of dignity.  It bowed before you, and spoke in a booming voice.  “For some eons more, the moon will remain steady without my power, my worthy Master.  Though my magic is now connected first to the moon above all else, I shall also offer my power to assist you in the restructuring of your world, as much as I am able.  State your wish, and I shall grant it.”<br />
<br />
Gwen frowned slightly, probably worried she could be replaced if other powerful magical beings started getting produced.  You’d try to talk with her about that later… and for now, it was probably better to put off making a few genies to keep the sun going, rearrange landmasses, too.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Phedra,” you say.  “For now, uh… wait in your bottle, I guess?”  Even if you weren’t worried about making Gwen insecure, you didn’t really have any wish ideas when you were “ruler of the world” anyway.<br />
<br />
“As you wish,” she replied, shrinking back into the bottle.<br />
<br />
Looking back to the lines of units, you think about what to make with them.  Well, you’d already made one into a living object… what were a few more?<br />
<br />
You point at two units.  “You two, become a set of hedges, trimmed to look like anthro mares, and stand at the front of the path to my house.  You’ll remain alive and conscious, and enjoy being looked at, soaking up the sun, and not be bothered that you can’t move.”<br />
<br />
The two units gave a “yes Master,” and stepped toward your front yard, standing at either side of the path leading to your mansion’s entrance.  Facing each other, both of them struck a pose with one hand on their heart, and the other raised an angle, forming a little arch over potential visitors.  <br />
<br />
The units’ feet grew roots which quickly burrowed deep into the ground, steadying them in place.  Then each of their bodies became far, far thinner, turning brown as they were covered in light layers of bark.  You held back a gasp as they seemed to become more like skeletons than people.  <br />
<br />
But soon enough, one branch sprouted from each of their stick-thin forms.  Then another, then another, leaves growing from the tips, giving the two figures a sense of mass and depth.  The areas around their roots took the cylindrical shape of hooves, rising up into long, thin horse legs, with new branches on their backs to resemble a horse’s silky tail.  Their “torsos” were broad, with a few bumps near the top to hint at a feminine chest.  The “faces” grew long and narrow, with a couple leaves rising out the top of each “head” to suggest a pair of horse’s ears.<br />
<br />
The two stood tall in their pose, quiet and unmoving.  <br />
<br />
Feeling a little uneasy, you speak to the hedge-units again.  “Let me hear your thoughts for a little while.”<br />
<br />
“Of course Master,” their girlish voices playing in your mind in unison.  “We’re so happy to get such an easy job, sitting here and being admired, having everything brought to us, water, sun, onlookers…  It’s truly ideal.  If only everyone could be as lucky as us happy hedges!”  Their voices sound genuinely grateful.  “Please, feel free to take in our beautifully clipped forms as much as you like.”<br />
<br />
The telepathic effect seems to stop after that.  <br />
<br />
“Those two make for some lovely decorations, Master,” Gwen said, smiling.  “I like seeing you get a chance to express your artistic side as well.”<br />
<br />
Well, with that bit of encouragement, you felt like going a little further with this.  You point to two more drones.  “Alright, uh, you two can become marble statues of lizard ladies, that double as columns for my Veranda.  You’ll enjoy your new roles, enjoy being looked at, and will let me hear your thoughts for the first minute or so after your change is complete.”  <br />
<br />
“Yes Master,” the two units said, moving toward your mansion.  Gwen used her magic to clear away the two columns nearest the steps, and hold up the roof as the units got into position.<br />
<br />
Each of them stood up where the columns once were, stood up straight, and held their arms high.  Their skin turned from gray, to white, with thin streaks of gray shooting through their surfaces, seemingly at random.  Their feet became thinner, with long toes, the nails being reshaped into claws.  Up and down their form, little half-circle indents were made, to give the impression of scales.  <br />
<br />
Their hips flared wider, and their thighs thicker, while their waists tightened slightly.  Their chests rounded out slightly, still lacking any intimate details, while on their backs a long, gradually tapering trail of stone slide out, and wrapped around to the front of their legs, the tips of these tails resting at their feet. Their their jaws extended into closed, angular snouts, with stoic expressions.<br />
<br />
As their forms were made perfectly steady due to the petrification, they started to slowly grow, until they extended from the top of the porch to the bottom of the room, with metal poles invisibly integrated inside their hands fixing them firmly into the veranda.<br />
<br />
The two voices spoke directly into your mind.  “Thank you, oh thank you, Master, for granting us strength to support your home, and to look lovely while doing it.  We shall remain resolute in serving you like this for eternity, if you so wish.”<br />
<br />
“Great,” you tell them.  “Enjoy your time.”  <br />
<br />
“They compliment your home very well, Master,” Gwen said.  “This neighborhood still had a long way to go, though.&quot;</p>
