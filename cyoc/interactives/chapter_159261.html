<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You smiled at the now quiet lamp that lay before your feet. For the first time, you had the upper hand to the jock, and you had the ability to command him to do whatever you wanted. Not only was the jock completely stripped of using all the powers that he had for himself, but he was going to be forced to use them to serve you. Your smile widened.<br />
<br />
You thought for a few minutes about what you wanted to ask of the Brock, the now-enslaved genie. Looking down at the lamp, you realized you could just use your three wishes to force the genie to serve you. Or...<br />
<br />
Your mind started to swirl with more evil thoughts. You didn&#39;t buy this lamp just to ask to have a genie serve your needs. Or to make you wealthy, or attractive. No, you wanted the full-blown powers of the genie. You smiled as you thought about this more carefully. <br />
<br />
You thought you&#39;d take a different approach. What if you were able to force Brock to give you all of his powers, without actually enslaving you the lamp? Even better, what if you could force the genie to grant you his entire being, the entire cosmic forces of the universe, and force him to completely integrate into your body his powers, all the while disposing of the jock who forced to live through such humiliation over the last four years. <br />
<br />
Your smile grew. &quot;Why not.&quot; You said. &quot;I always wanted to get some revenge of this piece of shit. And now I can finally get my way, in even a greater act of revenge than I ever thought possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
You pick up the heavy lamp with your left hand take your right palm to its surface. You rub it a couple of times as you feel it heat up. <br />
<br />
The black swirling smoke starts to billow out once more, but a figure begins to configure in front of your eyes as the body and massive physique of Brock the Genie emerges. &quot;ARRGH!&quot; he says once more. &quot;YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; You ask, innocently, as the 10 foot giant billows out and conjures once more in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to me!&quot; He shouted. &quot;Now I&#39;m enslaved in this fuckin lamp! And, WAIT NO! NOW I&#39;M YOUR SERVANT TOO?&quot;<br />
<br />
The thoughts in Brock&#39;s head swirled as he realized his powers were forcing him to listen to and do whatever you wanted. You chuckled. &quot;You rubbed the lamp, Brock.&quot; You said. &quot;it&#39;s your fate that you now have to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock opened his palms, his powers forcing him to listen to you. &quot;Hurry up then!&quot; he said. &quot;The faster you make your wishes the faster I can return to human form!&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause, just staring at him with a smile, knowing that your first and only wish will most certainly not release the genie back into a human form.<br />
<br />
Brock&#39;s cosmic powers allowed him to read your thoughts, and with it a growing concern of what was to happen to him. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; he asked. &quot;What do you want!?&quot; he ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought for awhile before deciding to bring you back out here to become my servant, Brock.&quot; You said. &quot;I could wish for anything, no? Tell me, my servant, I can wish for absolutely anything, can I not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock paused before his powers forced him to deliver an answer to his master. &quot;Yes.&quot; he said. One word.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that wish can absolutely result in your very demise can it not?&quot; You asked again, already knowing full well what the answer was, but too titillated to hear your genie tell you himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yes.&quot; He said once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; You answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You see, my servant,&quot; you add, &quot;I don&#39;t want just some satisfying wishes. I want the actual powers that you possess! The very awesome cosmic powers that both let you control the entirety of the universe and enslave you to your master such as myself! How can I possess those powers without the service that is required of a genie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock paused. You and him both knew the answer. You knew what you were going to do and Brock could read it. You smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie,&quot; you said, &quot;I thought of my first and only wish! I wish to obtain your entire cosmic powers, to possess, adapt and own the entirety of your powers without ever being enslaved to the lamp or anything for that matter! I want you to make me a god! But not just any god! I want all of your powers and I want you to give them to me by giving me your entire being!&quot; You start to speak louder and with more confidence, you know exactly what you want and how you&#39;re going to get it. &quot;You&#39;re going to donate your entire being into my body, create me into an immortal god, and let me own every ounce of your being. Once I obtain you, and once I become a god, I will decide what to do with you. Maybe I&#39;ll reanimate your human form, but only to let you see me ridicule you in whatever way I fancy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brock&#39;s wrists slowly raised to the level of his face, looking at his hands as they ordered him to heed my wish. &quot;No. You can&#39;t, ARGH, NO YOU CAN&#39;T!&quot;<br />
<br />
His wrists started to dissolve with his genie cuffs as his forearms too started to disintegrate into pure power. &quot;NO my body! MY POWERS! PLEASE DON&#39;T DO THIS TO ME!&quot; he shouted again as his biceps and shoulders started to disintegrate. &quot;TAKE IT BACK PLEASE!&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled. &quot;Fuck no, Brock. You are mine now in every way. I&#39;m going to become a god and I&#39;m going to get to finally do whatever the fuck I want. Weep as your powers become mine to have and control!&quot;<br />
<br />
The smoke started directing itself toward me. &quot;Oh fuck yeah come to your new owner!&quot; I say. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO PLEASE TAKE IT BACK, YOU CAN STILL STOP THIS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ORDER IT!&quot; You shout. &quot;I take none of it back. MAKE ME INTO A GOD! AND LET ME OWN YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
The smoke hit your body with extreme pleasure, awakening your mind with the awesome and inevitable powers you were about to gain. &quot;OH FUCK YEAH I CAN FEEL IT!&quot; You shout. &quot;I CAN FEEL YOU ENTERING ME HAHAHAHA!&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch the smoke that is Brock&#39;s immortal being cover you and aggressively bury itself under your skin. Smiling, you watch as your t-shirt incinerates over your body, revealing a chest that is already growing with pure slabs of rock-hard muscle. You notice that unlike Brock, you were gaining masculine traits of hair as your arm pit starts to grow with thicker brown hair and as your chest and now-emerging eight pack start to have a forest grow on it. <br />
<br />
The smoke attacks your shorts as it tears them to shreds, your socks and shoes quickly ripping apart and tattering at your feet. You step your naked feet forward as you notice them growing, extending in length and strength as a shadow of brown hair grows over it, then up your shins, now quaking with a purely defined sculpt of muscle. Your quads start to bulk out as your boxers start to get uncomfortably tight. You feel your butt push out harder and wider as the smoke quickly tears them to shreds. The feeling of now being buck naked was unlike anything else you had ever felt. You were proud to wear nothing. Proud to let your powers bury themselves into you. &quot;OH FUCK YEAH!&quot; You shout as your quads grow upward, stretching higher and growing you from your measly, mortal 5&#39;8 to 6, then 7 feet in height. &quot;MORE!&quot; You order as the genie&#39;s powers transform you into a god. You feel your butt push hard as your cock starts to weigh down, growing in length and girth as veins begin to spider out and up your Adonis, cutting in a deep, well-defined V.<br />
<br />
Your testicles grow down heavy as you feel your sexual drive kick into the most aggressive and controlled you had ever felt. You could fuck everything at once if you wanted, you had the virility of the entire universe. You stretch your body as you feel the tornado to transform your flesh into pure containers of the universe&#39;s most immortal and awesome powers. &quot;HAHAH!&quot; You shout as your body pushes against the locker room, exploding the ceiling and the walls of the room, then of the entire school. You explode into a monster growing quickly from 10 to 100 feet. You feel your own quads wrap into a maelstrom of power as they cover your mortal legs, but you care not. You can reform them at any time. You stretch your arms high as you explode toward the night sky, realizing that you have become a god among gods, the most powerful entity in the universe. You feel Brock&#39;s presence become locked inside your immortal containers as you tell him that you are now and forever his owner, and that you will use the powers to further your own means and only your own.<br />
<br />
You shoot yourself into the end reaches of space, flying at the speed of the expanding universe, cackling in your pure powers.</p>
