<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary enjoyed her meal, but something about Jess still bothered her.  For one thing, although they both still grew, Jess&#39; growth rapidly outpaced her own.  The small kitchen was soon cramped by their two growing bodies, and Mary was pushed to the side by Jess&#39; massive girth as she grew. Jess had to twist her body to fit in the kitchen, leaving only her abdomen and one leg in front of Mary&#39;s view.  <br />
<br />
At first Mary was preoccupied with her meal, but as she ate she found herself fascinated by that leg as it changed.  As time passed the thigh grew thicker, like her own, but it was covered by tough red leathery skin rather than her soft pink flesh. Her calves seemed longer, too.  Mary growing belly and short calves made it difficult to walk or move, but it looked like Jess would have no problems crawling with her long lean legs.  She caught glimpses of Jess&#39; foot resting beneath her belly.  It looked longer than hers, and wider at the base.  Her hooves looked longer, thinner, and sharper.<br />
<br />
Maybe she is becoming a boar or something, thought Mary, as she continued to eat.  <br />
<br />
Eating felt good, but she never felt satisfied.  It was like constantly being on the verge of an orgasmic climax, but never quite reaching it.  It didn&#39;t help that she and Jess were competing for food.  Once, she stood up and tried to walk around Jess&#39; body to get more food, but after she heard the growl from her larger friend, she decided it would be better to stick with her own food and leave Jess alone.<br />
<br />
After the majority of the food was gone, Mary began to get thirsty.  She had long ago finished the sodas she had brought from the store.  She had seen Jess sipping from some bottled water, but her greedy body decided it would rather have the soda.  Now she was so thirsty, she would drink anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I have some of your water? I am dying of thirst over here, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this is mine.  Get your own water, &quot; rumbled Jess&#39; deep voice from the other side of her body.<br />
<br />
Rude much.  What a pig! thought Mary.  &quot;Fine.  Where did you get that water anyway?  I didn&#39;t buy any at the store, &quot; said Mary, as she stood up.  Her belly was huge, and sagged and dipped down between her knees.  It made it difficult to stand, much less walk.  She considered crawling, and thought perhaps she should not have taken that much of the pig vial.  But it didn&#39;t seem to bother Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it out of the fridge, &quot; said Jess.  &quot;Do you have any more food?  I am still so hungry.  I&#39;m starrrvvving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we are all out.  If you want any more, you will need to get it yourself.  I went last time, so its your turn &quot; said Mary.  &quot;Wait ... did you say you got the water from the fridge?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary waddled to the fridge door, and opened it.  Her fears were confirmed.  One of the water bottles she had poured one of the vials into was missing.  She had diluted the contents of the vial a little and had planned to try them out later, but now one was gone.  But which one?<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Mary.  Don&#39;t you have just a little food left?  Even a morsel.  I am still sooooo hunnggrry &quot; said Jess, as she lifted her large head with her long neck over her massive body, and looked at Mary&#39;s face. Mary suddenly knew which vial she had taken, and began to get scared.  The leathery skin, the jagged claws.  And now she was staring at the long neck lined by sharp spines ending in a large snout filled with jagged teeth.  Two sharp twisted horns spiraled out of her head, and two large yellow reptilian eyes glared at her.  &quot;I need moooore, &quot; cooed the dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, I think you need to give me that bottle.  There is something wrong with you, and that bottle is making it worse,&quot; said Mary, as she started to slowly waddle her way towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing wrong with me. I feel great. Better than ever.  And every sip from this bottle makes me feel even better.  You are just jealous.  Get your own, you ..... you pig, &quot; chuckled Jess, as she tilted the bottle up in her jaw, and chugged  the remainder of its contents down her throat. &quot;Now get me some more food, little pig.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have any more food, &quot; said Mary, as she slowly kept walking towards the door.  She had considered making a try for the box of vials in the living room, but she did not like Jess&#39; new attitude.  She was creeping towards the front door, just in case she had to make a hasty retreat. Jess stood up just a little, her massive body cramped in the small space, her back rubbing against the ceiling.  She turned her body to face the retreating Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going, little pig? Hopefully to get me more food, &quot; said Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this has gone on long enough.  We&#39;ve had our fun, and now we are out of food.  I think its time we used the vials to revert back to humans again, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no.  I am not ready just yet.  I am still having too much fun, and this feels just too good, &quot; said Jess, as her body began to react to the last dose of the water bottle, and grow even larger.  &quot;And I see more food right here.  Right in front of me.  A nice, juicy, plump, succulent pig, &quot; said Jess, as stared at Mary, salivating and licking her lips with her long tongue.</p>
