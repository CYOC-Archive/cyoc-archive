<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, as whatever it was he was turning into. Peter really wished there were a mirror so he could probably watch what was happening. It seemed like he was getting a lot leaner, and there was fur. Lots of it. It seemed to be coming in mostly tan, blending to white on his palms and wrists. That could be anything, really. His hair felt shaggier, his ears were creeping up towards the top of his head. Feeling them, they were more triangular. His chest felt heavy. Heavy and fluffy. Definitely seemed like more fur was sprouting from his neck and shoulders, but it couldn&#39;t all weigh that much could it? Suddenly his legs shifted and he had to steady himself against the wall. His knees really wanted to bend, and his feet felt too big. It took a bit to work out that his legs were changing to be more... what was the word for it? Digitigrade or something like that? Like a cat&#39;s or a dog&#39;s. It forced him onto his toes, which felt extremely strange until it didn&#39;t. His tail was definitely helping to keep him steady. That one really snuck up on him, but there it was, swinging around back there. Also really floofy. Why didn&#39;t that feel as heavy as his chest?<br />
<br />
Next came a serious rumbling in his stomach. Definitely some internal changes happening there. His waist really seemed to be thinning out a bit, and oh, it was like his intestines were doing cartwheels or something. He shifted his stance a bit, hoping he wouldn&#39;t cause a scene if his guts just decided to empty themselves right out on the floor. He figured maybe it all had to deal with his new diet? No more being an omnivore, he&#39;d need... feeling around his teeth with his tongue as his mouth and nose elongated to more of a snout. Mainly meat clearly. Speaking of meat, things felt... off down there. Reaching down he was a little startled by the thick black claws at the ends of his fingers meeting fur, it was an odd sensation. Plus his junk didn&#39;t seem to be hanging where it should be. That was a concern, but before he could investigate it, he noticed the door in front of him springing open, and &quot;TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE&quot; popping up on the screen. He&#39;d have to check himself out somewhere else. He was one of two hundred test subjects being processed for this, and he sure didn&#39;t want the next guy seeing him literally pawing at his crotch. So for the time being he just hurried out the door.<br />
<br />
Everything about his balance was off, but a quick sprint felt pretty natural, and feeling the wind on his fur just kind of felt weirdly right. Still no mirrors though. After what felt like enough of a distance to have a little privacy Peter stopped by a tree and got to really exploring his new body with his hands and some creative posing. Feeling out the shape of his new head seemed like the most logical place to start, and it at least seemed more canine than feline. There was a black tip on the end of his new tail, he worked out once he realized he could just kind of put it between his legs, so his best guess was some kind of wolf... but something still felt off. With a little dread and some curious fingering, Peter gradually fought through the initial denial to face the fact that he was no longer a he, but a she. Clearly, something had gone wrong.<br />
<br />
Panic set in, as Peter considered the one-way nature of those transformation chambers, even ignoring all the traffic. Right now, they were only letting people come in and turn into animals, not leave and turn back. There had to be some sort of emergency system though, right? Wasn&#39;t that covered in orientation? Peter was panting now, and sniffing at the air nervously. Right, emergency phones! The plan was to keep anything artificial out of the park once it was properly open, but for now they had phones strung all along the perimeter in case anything went wrong. Peter just had to pick a direction and keep going.<br />
<br />
She started heading even further from the entrance to find one as far from the gates as possible, but eventually compromised after getting winded and realizing wolves were better at short bursts of speed than long distances. Still, the phones were spaced out frequently enough that when she found one dangling down from an extension cord slung over the outer wall, nobody else was in sight. There was no dialing required, just mashing the screen anywhere gave a direct line to the staff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, what&#39;s your emergency?&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter gulped, taking a moment, before just blurting out, &quot;something went wrong and the booth turned me into a woman!&quot; She was a bit taken aback by her voice sounding like that of, well, a husky woman.<br />
<br />
The person on the other end sighed, and quickly rattled off a reply that was unmistakably being read off a script. &quot;As was explained in your contract, in order to achieve a balance of five males and five females of each of the twenty species represented in this trial, all forms have been assigned without subject input. Dissatisfaction with such a form is not considered-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well species sure, but why a woman!?&quot; Peter shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dissatisfaction with such a form is not considered to be an emergency, and subjects are to deal with the hand they are dealt and live as is natural to their new instincts for the duration of the test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Additionally it should be noted that many subjects will experience the trial as a different gender than what is marked on their medical records. This is due in part to a disparity among volunteers, but as the option to select a gender for one&#39;s stay is a planned feature for future park goers, even some members of a minority gender may experience a change to ensure this service is functioning properly. Please enjoy your stay and keep this line clear for actual emergencies.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a click before Peter could object further. She was, apparently, stuck like this for the next two months. She carefully released the dangling phone and made her way back towards the treeline, wondering how she was going to cope. Although she planned to be alone with her thoughts, not long after she caught a strong smell in the air, and the sound of someone trampling through the underbrush.</p>
