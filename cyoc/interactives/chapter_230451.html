<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Talia thought for a moment, as she fiddled with the app, thinking of what to change. She might as well test it on herself, she supposed, her finger hovering over her own name on the map in contemplation. As she mused about the possibilities, she tensed up as she heard Roger’s voice from the doorway. “Talia, I thought I told you to get back to work!” He yelled, looking out disapprovingly as he looked at her on her phone, smoking her cigarette. “How many times have I gotta say it! Move your lazy ass!” <br />
<br />
She grimaced, “Uh, yes sir…” Talia barely managed to keep herself from growling out glaring daggers at him as he leered at her warily, making his way back in. She sneered as soon as he was out of sight. She’d given him a shrimpy cock and removed a lot of his masculine good looks in the process, but it seemed it would take a lot more for him to stop being a jerk.<br />
<br />
As she looked back at her phone, she noticed she had already hit the button and watched as it generated another sentence based on herself. That wasn’t too bad, she thought, maybe she could change something to get herself as far away from this dump and Roger as possible? Almost anything could be better she thought, as she saw the new sentence pop up.<br />
<br />
“This app’s user hates their boss, Roger Willis.”<br />
<br />
She frowned at the simplicity of the sentence, but knew it was true. She DID hate him. Very much in fact. She thought for a moment, maybe she should select him instead? A mischievous grin crossed her face as she thought of it. With this app, she could REALLY make him miserable, as payback for being such a douche to her all these years. She held up the phone, smirking as she prepared to search again…<br />
<br />
“Alright Talia, are you gonna come back in here or am I gonna have to drag you in myself?”<br />
<br />
She flinched as she felt Roger’s hand grab her wrist, looking up to see him glaring at her, annoyed. “Ugh, give me a damn break!” She yelled, wrenching it away from him, “There’s not many customers out there anyway, so just leave me alone, okay?!” Roger sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “Talia, I’m not paying you to stand around all day on your phone, get your fat ass back in there!” Talia glared at him, “Just give me a minute! Geez!” She huffed in frustration at his obstinate attitude. <br />
<br />
He returned her angry gaze, before his expression softened somewhat… and became a more lecherous smirk, “Y’know… If you want some extra time to yourself, maybe we can work something out?” He snickered as Talia’s expression darkened. Suddenly she felt her boss’ hands groping her ass, “I’ll let you have a break… If you do a little something for me first?”<br />
<br />
Without thinking, Talia slapped his face, knocking him onto the pavement, “Get your hands off of me you bastard!” She sneered as Roger rubbed his cheek, scowling at her. As she looked at the smaller, more pathetic man she’d made him into, a sleazy lech instead of a charming heartbreaker, her furious expression gave way to cruel malice, “Like I’d ever do it with a fat, shrimp-dicked, ugly little twerp who can’t even get it up in bed!” She cackled as his face fell, horrified that she knew about that, “You always disgusted me, Roger! Always creeping on me, touching me, you sicken me! You’re a horrible, small little man! You were always making my life miserable!” She turned her attention back to her phone, “...But you’re not going to be a problem anymore…” She snickered as she prepared to generate a new sentence.<br />
<br />
Just then, Roger scrambled to his feet and grabbed her hand again before she could, “Shut the fuck up, you stupid fucking bitch!” He said, his grip tighter as she tried to pull away, “Hey, if you had fucking done your job like you’re supposed to, we wouldn’t be having this conversation!” He growled out as she tried to push him away. Even in spite of being emasculated, physically he was still stronger than she was. “It’s always rotten little whores like you! Damn bitches always made fun of me!” Strangely there seemed to be tears in his eyes, as if Talia’s rejection of him struck a nerve. “I did everything for you and you still won’t even look my way! You still don’t even give a shit about me!” He snarled. <br />
<br />
“Ugh! Get your dirty hands off of me, Roger!” Talia likewise growled back angrily as he attempted to push him away, “I’ll scream! I’ll call the fucking cops!” Roger’s eyes turned towards her phone, suddenly he tried wrenching it out of her hands, “Would you stop fucking around with that phone already?!” Her eyes widened, “That’s mine! Let go of it!” She yelled as as she tried tugging it back from him. As they pulled on either end, the phone suddenly slipped from her grasp and fell to the floor. <br />
<br />
Talia blanched, “No… No, no, no!” She scrambled, diving to the ground as Roger recoiled, stumbling back a bit as he lost his grip. Anxiously, Talia scooped the phone up, hoping it was okay, that the app was still working, that she could still change something, but as she looked at the screen, her breath caught in her throat. Something HAD been changed already. The sentence it had generated earlier had been edited in their struggle!</p>
