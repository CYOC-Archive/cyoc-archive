<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Are you sure it will work and that we'll remain in control of the curse?" Jen asked looking at her uniform with an angry 
expression.</p>
<p>"As sure as I can be," Ariel said shrugging. "From what I've been able to learn of the game you can dare someone to do anything 
and they'll do it even if it's a dare to ask 'Transform or dare?' and giving specific instructions."</p>
<p>"And you think Kyle will pick dare?"</p>
<p>"Actually I expect him to cover his ears and run when he sees you. If he can't hear you then it won't work."</p>
<p>"He has to know that we've been suspended now," Jen said pulling on some jeans. "He'll be expecting me to curse him."</p>
<p>"Yes but I doubt he'll expect us to be waiting in his house. I'm sure he'll think he's safe in his own home. You do remember what to 
say depending on what Kyle says or doesn't say?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Jen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Then let's go," Ariel said seeing that Jen was dressed.</p>
<p>For Ariel's plan to work neither of their cars could be seen around Kyle's house so they took the bus. Ariel had looked at the routes 
so she knew where they would have to get off at. If things went as planned they would get to Kyle's house in time to meet his mother 
before he got home a few minutes later. They even had their way inside his house planned. Of course if his mother wasn't home Ariel 
had a backup plan. The backup plan wasn't needed though as Mrs. Perkins answered the door with, "Hello, may I help you girls?"</p>
<p>"We're here to see Kyle," Ariel said then gesturing to herself and Jen continued with, "I'm Ariel Murphy and this is Jennifer Smith. 
We want to apologize to him for pantsing him last week. We know it was embarrassing for him and we don't expect him to forgive us but 
we do want to apologize to him."</p>
<p>"You girls can come in and wait for him to get home," Mrs. Perkins said standing back to let them in. Once they were seated in the 
living room and had a Diet Coke each she asked, "Has Kyle done anything to you for you pantsing him?"</p>
<p>"We did get suspended and kicked off of our extracurricular activities," Jen admitted telling part of the truth. She and Ariel had 
decided not to mention the curse just incase Mrs. Perkins believed it and tried to stop them.</p>
<p>"I'm home Mom," Kyle called out as he came into the living room and stopped with a shocked look on his face.</p>
<p>Before Kyle could recover from his shock Jen quickly asked, "Kyle, transform or dare?"</p>
<p>"I thought you girls were going to apologize for pantsing him not curse him," Mrs. Perkins said.</p>
<p>"He cursed Jen first which led to us being suspended for two months when what we did was a little high school hazing," Ariel said 
looking at Kyle.</p>
<p>"How?" Mrs. Perkins asked.</p>
<p>Kyle had recovered when Jen had asked him "Transform or dare?" and now threw some sort of powder in her face causing her to 
sneeze. With a smile he said, "Thanks for giving the curse back to me Jen. There's a reason why I said you would have to wait ten 
minutes between sneezes. If you don't give me a transform or dare or both in that time the curse comes passes to me with no harm 
done. Since you aren't in control now you can't talk to me until you sneeze again. Now all I have to do is decide how I'm going to curse 
your friends that helped pants me."</p>
<p>"Well there's a problem there Kyle," Ariel said grinning from ear to ear. "Having been transformed by the curse myself I researched it 
and found that time limit too.</p>
<p>"I don't see the problem," Kyle said sure that he was winning.</p>
<p>"I'm not transforming Kyle and your minute is up," Jen said also grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Kyle visibly paled when he realized that Jen wasn't transforming and asked, "How?"</p>
<p>"Jen explained what happened to me and after passing it on to me I undid what you had done," Ariel said stifling a laugh.</p>
<p>"What are you girls going to do to him?" Mrs. Perkins asked looking worried. "You won't turn him into an inanimate object will 
you?"</p>
<p>"Well he may be an inanimate object sometimes," Ariel said nodding to Jen.</p>
<p>Jen became serious and said, "You thought that being pantsed was embarrassing well just wait. For your transformation you will 
become a special girl in body only. What makes you so special is that you're unable to wear any clothes and you'll transform how me 
and Ariel want when we want. Just the three of us will know that you have been cursed everyone else, including your mother, will think 
that you've always been this way."</p>
<p>"I'll get you back for this!" Kyle said starting to look sick.</p>
<p>"No you won't," Jen said smiling. "For your dare I dare you to become mine and Ariel's slave unable to harm either of us in any way 
and to give the curse back to me by daring me to say that I love Ariel."</p>
<p>As soon as Jen had finished speaking Kyle hastily took his clothes off as if they were on fire. His body looked more feminine than 
Jen had imagined with his dick being really small. No wonder he was embarrassed being pantsed with that little thing which started 
getting smaller and smaller until it couldn't easily be seen anymore. His now empty ball sack slid down to between his legs and a 
feminine slit formed. His butt plumped up as his hips widened and waist narrowed. His areolae grew while breast tissue built up behind 
them until he had d cup breasts. His barely seen Adam's Apple disappeared as his face became a little more feminine. The final change 
was his hair growing down to his waist. Kyle sank to his knees as he asked, "Jen, transform or dare?" his voice a girl's voice.</p>
<p>"Dare," Jen said smiling.</p>
<p>"I dare you to say that you love Ariel," Kyle said in a defeated tone.</p>
<p>Jen looked at Ariel with a smile and said, "I love Ariel."</p>
<p>"How are you doing Kylie?" Mrs. Perkins asked.</p>
<p>"I've been cursed, how do you think I'm doing?" Kyle asked throwing his hands up. "I'm not supposed to be a girl or naked."</p>
<p>"I know that you want to wear clothes like your friends and mistresses but you were born unable to wear clothes," Mrs. Perkins said 
placing a hand on Kyle's shoulder.</p>
<p>"But I'm not supposed to be this way," Kyle said almost pleading.</p>
<p>"Our parents should be getting home and we need to tell them about our suspension so we'll get going," Ariel said getting up. "We'll 
send Kylie back tomorrow for a longer visit."</p>
<p>"Be good for your mistresses and I'll see you tomorrow," Mrs. Perkins said hugging Kyle and kissing him on his head.</p>
<p>Ariel and Jen were waiting for Kyle by though door looking at him with stern expressions so he slowly got up and followed them out 
to Ariel's car which hadn't been there before. "How come your car is here now?" he asked not understanding.</p>
<p>"Simple, we came to curse you and we didn't want you prepared for us if you saw either of our cars so we took the bus," Ariel 
explained getting in. "Of course that was before we cursed you. Now with everyone believing that this is the way you've always been 
we didn't need that subterfuge."</p>
<p>"What are going to do to me now?" Kyle asked sitting in the back seat.</p>
<p>"That's a good question Kylie," Jen said with a smile.</p></p>
