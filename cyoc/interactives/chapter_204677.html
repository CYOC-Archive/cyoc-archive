<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Rise and shine, sleepyhead!&quot;<br />
<br />
You blink, groaning. Your dreams quickly -- perhaps mercifully -- fade, and you find yourself curled in Moonstone&#39;s bed, apparently having rolled onto your side and tucked your legs in during the night. It doesn&#39;t take you long to register this, or recall your situation -- and for a moment the fact that you&#39;ve molded yourself to the pet bed enflames the lingering dread from your dreams.<br />
<br />
But you quickly brush it off. It doesn&#39;t mean anything. You&#39;re not giving in. You&#39;re not going to.<br />
<br />
You <i>will</i> escape.<br />
<br />
You push yourself out of the bed and onto your feet, facing the source of the chipper wake-up call. Moonstone herself, of course. Stretching, you try and fail to keep from yawning in her face. Not that the slave vixen seems to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time is it?&quot; you ask, noticing that Agate is still in her bed -- on her back, limbs in the air, the cutely animalistic posture making a jarring contrast to her human head. And upright human dick, you notice with a blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven! More-or-less. Mistress and I have been up for nearly an hour. She goes out for a walk in the woods eeeevery morning to meditate and clear her mind for the day, while I fix breakfast. And I wanted to know if you&#39;d help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seven, huh? Normally you&#39;d be getting up this time anyway. It must be the unfamiliar bed -- and your reason for being here -- that&#39;s making you reluctant to wake up. But you shrug at the white vixen&#39;s &quot;question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m up. So I might as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay! Go get freshened up, and meet me in the kitchen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, as you start to move, you realise you feel a bit better than last night. While your sleep was troubled, your head feels clearer. And with that clarity comes reassurance that you can handle this crazy situation and get out of here.<br />
<br />
You step into the slaves&#39; lavatory. Splashing some water on your face, you note the presence of a cabinet with toiletries, each girl having her own comb, brushes, old-fashioned toothbrush, tin of toothpaste, and so on. And it really begins to sink in that Junia does spend an awful lot on her &quot;pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
That makes you feel uneasy as you pick up the towel that Moon set aside for you and dry your face off. It feels like... a bribe, you guess? But it&#39;s something deeper than the idea of being rewarded with fancy stuff in exchange for obedience. It&#39;s the idea that Junia actually does <i>care</i> for her slaves, as if they really were valued pets.<br />
<br />
All she asks in return is obedience, affection... and sex. Worshipping her mighty cock and perfect boobs. Warmth begins to spread from the tattoo on your belly.<br />
<br />
For a moment you shudder, unable to move as you are caught between your natural loathing of the idea and a traitorous longing for your owner&#39;s love. But then you reject the surely implanted appeal that becoming a beast woman&#39;s pet holds. <i>Never!</i> You channel your rage at this damned enchantment into an even firmer resolution to escape.<br />
<br />
As soon as you emerge from the lavatory, Moonstone takes your hand and again tugs you eagerly along. You don&#39;t resist, but you do pay more attention to the tower around you, beginning to memorise the layout. Obviously you <i>are</i> going to need to escape fast before the spell takes too firm a hold on you, but you need to be smart about it.<br />
<br />
And there&#39;s no need to be a jerk to Moon, however grating her attitude might be. This time you actively participate in the process of -- making pancakes? Blueberry pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs. This recalls a question that had flitted through your mind yesterday, but were too overwhelmed to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh... where do they get their meat, in Pedda?&quot; you ask as you slice long, thick strips of meat from a slab of what smells like pork. Considering the many predators you saw at your auction, there must be a lot of demand for it. And -- while you don&#39;t have much love for <i>any</i> of the creatures here, you don&#39;t like the idea that you&#39;re cutting up a former person, even an animal person.<br />
<br />
Moonstone tilts her head. &quot;Why -- oh!&quot; She snickers. &quot;You&#39;re worried that we eat each other? Silly. There are unevolved animals around too, with ranchers who keep them, and game parks for predators to hunt in.&quot; She looks uncomfortable for just a second. &quot;There <i>are</i> rumours that sometimes evolved animals are eaten too...&quot; She perks back up. &quot;But I don&#39;t believe them! Who would do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Animals who kidnap people and force them to become sex slaves?</i> You don&#39;t voice this idea, however. You&#39;ll just hope that Moonstone is right. The unsettling train of thought is derailed anyway as you hear Moon &quot;oooo.&quot; You look up to see her walking over to your cutting board.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re slicing them really thick!&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause. &quot;Does... she not like her bacon thick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.&quot; Moon puts a finger to her muzzle in thought. &quot;I&#39;m not sure! I&#39;ve always done &#39;em thin and crispy, but why don&#39;t you do it your way? If she likes it, yay! If not, I&#39;ll take the blame for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
You blink, finding that oddly touching. &quot;Would you be punished?&quot;<br />
<br />
She makes a face. &quot;Once you come to love her like she deserves, her disappointment is punishment enough. Though if she&#39;s <i>really</i> mad at me, she doesn&#39;t fuck me for a day or two. That hasn&#39;t happened in a loooong time, though -- I&#39;ve learned how to please her so well!&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn&#39;t that great. Being reminded of Moon&#39;s happy submission instantly sours your mood again. &quot;Is that also how she punishes Agate?&quot; you ask, figuring that the reluctant slut would be far less phased by Junia&#39;s disapproval. And -- at least at first -- glad to dodge a sexing that would progress her transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Moon replies. &quot;She uses toys and magic to make her realise that she, well, exists for sex now. Mistress can be <i>really</I> good at making you think that you&#39;re, like, being used for public sex and cumming yourself every time a big cock goes in one of your holes, when you&#39;re actually just tied up by yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles, and you notice a bulge twitching under her apron. You can&#39;t help but make a sound of disgust. Moon isn&#39;t offended, just sticking her tongue out at your discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all to help us adjust, Coral. Mistress isn&#39;t really into negative reinforcement. With her power and beauty, she doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> to be.&quot; She giggles. &quot;Not that she doesn&#39;t like a little rough play, every now and then. Some slaps to make your butt shake around her cock. Now come on, stop daydreaming and fry that bacon!&quot;<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Moonstone does an excellent job of making you forget Mistress -- er, Junia&#39;s promise to take you shopping today. You serve Junia, and blush your way through her enjoying your bacon -- even in something so mundane, you find yourself appreciating her praise way more than you should. Your own breakfast is also delicious; Moonstone is really a great cook, and even eating on the floor you lose yourself in the meal.<br />
<br />
But the witch reminds you soon enough, calling you into the front hall shortly after you wash up. She puts your slave collar back on, though this time the leash she attaches is a fancy leather one belonging to her. But she also has something else for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, slaves should not be covered in public.&quot; You are staring at the item in her hand, and it takes you a bit to process that what she is holding are black panties -- of a sort. There is large pouch in the front to accommodate male genitals, and a line of golden runes around the waistband. &quot;But you are not fully formed yet, and these will both hide what you should not have, and help prepare you for what you should.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tosses them to you, and you catch them automatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put them on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grudgingly, you obey -- and God do you hate how good the soft, silken fabric feels as it slides up your smooth fur and skin. The ordeal is made worse by the fact that Moonstone and Agate are also present. As they expand around your hips, you can see that the sides are see-through lace, making patterns of flowers and branches over your hips and butt while doing little to hide your pale flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re stronger than they look,&quot; Junia assures you, her smirk saying that she knows that&#39;s not why you&#39;re grimacing. &quot;Now let me help you get adjusted.&quot; She comes over, moves your hands away, and starts to tuck your equipment into the pouch at the front. You huff through your teeth, trying to resist her erotic scent and the feel of her groping.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s no doubt about it, your owner is trying to get you aroused -- and she succeeds much easier than you&#39;d like. It takes all your willpower not to thrust against her as she cups your balls or delicately slides a claw up the underside of your tumescent shaft. Even after she gets the panties snugly around your widened hips, she continues to tease you, gently squeezing at your ballsack and throbbing prick, which pushes lewdly out in front of you now, tightly squeezed by the black silk.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re both amazed at how well the fabric stretches while clinging to you like a soft second skin, and also wondering how this is supposed to &quot;hide&quot; anything. But the witch isn&#39;t through. Once she has you to full arousal, she begins to push. In. Your eyes widen in horror as you see your cock shrink into the smooth fabric of the panties. As you <i>feel</i> it sink back into you, and your ballsack slowly flatten, pressing your balls tight to your groin under her gentle but insistent pressure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah -- ah what --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold still, slave,&quot; she says sweetly, preempting you from backing away, instead forcing you to brace your trembling legs. In fact, at this point it&#39;s her command more than your will that keeps you from desperately rubbing into her hand and encouraging her to emasculate you. Once again, despite your horror, the pleasure is too much for you to do anything other than succumb. <br />
<br />
The feeling of her fingers on your cock gets more and more intense as it shrinks, the fabric not seeming to be a barrier at all. Then you feel your balls pop in, one after another, and your knees buckle. &quot;Ah! Mistress --&quot; You start to fall forward, and Junia catches you to her, her muzzle meeting your lips. You submit to her kiss, helplessness welling up together with impendent orgasm.<br />
<br />
Now the feeling of her teasing is completely alien. Your cock is just a little nub, sending racking jolts of pleasure through your whenever she brushes it. Your ballsack has been replaced by swollen lips, parted slightly, soaked fabric rubbing between them as she massages you.<br />
<br />
And just as you&#39;re about to melt into mindless bliss, she pulls away, leaving you flushed and gasping. You rub your legs together, grinding your teeth in frustration as you stare down at the cameltoe in the tight black silk, feminine juice soaking through and dripping down your legs; and unable to do anything to finish what the witch started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels very real, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; she asks. &quot;But it&#39;s all an illusion. While it looks, feels and even smells like a cunt, underneath those panties, your cock and balls are still perfectly intact. It would be boring to use a spell to take your manhood when I can do it with my cum. But now you get a sweet little foretaste of what it will be like, once you&#39;ve accepted yourself. And this isn&#39;t all they can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
She murmurs, and the runes light up. You suck in a breath, eyes widening as you feel a hot, pointed tip press against your female opening. Whimpering, you spread your legs as an increasingly wide shaft invades the passage you supposedly don&#39;t have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what the hell...&quot; Again you start to fall, and again Junia catches you, smirking down at you as you look up from her pillowy bust. With a word, she stops the sensation just as you felt a knot kiss your lips... leaving your body hungry for it to return.<br />
<br />
&quot;A phantom cock for a phantom fucking,&quot; she explains. &quot;I&#39;m going to be attending a meeting at the Wizards Guild, something far beyond a simple pet. This will give you something to do, instead of just staring at the walls of the waiting room. So -- while we&#39;re out -- you have permission to masturbate, but only with the panties. You can activate them yourself with the magic words &#39;please train me.&#39; You won&#39;t be able to revoke the spell, though; it&#39;ll fuck you until you feel that big fox cock knot you and fill you with spunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shiver. There&#39;s no way in hell you&#39;d say that! But... deep down, you&#39;re afraid you will. That the need to feel that knot again, even if it&#39;s fake, will become too strong to deny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... why take me...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, pet, we&#39;re going shopping after; and they&#39;ll have to measure you for your bed and your collar. Besides, respectable beasts do usually have at least one slave to help them with errands. Now come along.&quot; She takes up the leash, and begins leading you towards the front door. Over her shoulder she calls, &quot;Behave you two! We&#39;ll see you this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good-bye Mistress!&quot; shouts Moonstone with enough enthusiasm for both her and the silent Agate. &quot;Have fun Coral!&quot;</p>
