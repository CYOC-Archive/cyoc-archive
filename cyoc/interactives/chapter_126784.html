<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa gazed over the girls as the sullenly ate their dinner, none of them had much to say after what was proving to be a very difficult afternoon. The quiet though was proving to be helpful for Lisa. She had never met Claudia’s parents before and now she felt tasked with helping them understand a bisexual teenage girl. Lisa herself was still grappling with the subject but hoped to offer some perspective on the matter. The sound of the doorbell shook her out of her thoughts now as she looked at the girls.<br />
<br />
“That’s probably your parents Claudia,” she said. Claudia now looked nervously between Lisa and her friends. Lisa placed a comforting hand on her shoulder and smiled. “Don’t worry I’ll be with you the entire way.” Claudia gulped and nodded as the two of them headed towards the door.<br />
<br />
Now left alone in the kitchen the girls anxiously looked at one another. “Oh man I hope the major isn’t here,” Mary Elise said. “Major?” Kellie asked. Mary Elise nodded sadly. “Yeah the major,” she moaned. “Claudia’s dad is retired from the Marines. He used to be a Major  so we’ve all just called him that. He’s definitely scary.”<br />
<br />
Criousity won out over fear as Katie and Kellie crept to the doorway to see Claudia’s parents, both girls eyes popped in surprise by what they saw. Claudia’s parents were both much older than they had suspected, Claudia’s mom looked to be a small woman in her mid fifties with blond hair streaked with grey. Unlike her daughter this woman appeared timid as she huddled next to a giant of a man. Claudia’s father was a huge,towering over everyone at about six and a half feet tall. He appeared to be in about sixty with close cropped grey hair, steel blue eyes and a chiseled jaw. Gazing down at his daughter with a disapproving look Katie and Kellie could see Claudia shrink back ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for inviting us over miss,” he said in a gravelly voice. Lisa nodded as she looked over this intimidating man. Taking a breath to compose herself she invited them inside. The girls now watched as Claudia’s parents made their way inside taking a seat in the living room across from Claudia. Instinctively Claudia’s mom went over to her daughter to clean her face while her father stood stone still and glowered at her.<br />
<br />
“Majorie stop that,” he stated. Marjorie, Claudia’s mother glared back her husband with a defiant look. “Tom will you stop,” she hissed. “Our baby is hurt and you want to stand in formation like it’s a damn inspection.” Tom fidgeted slightly but remained where he was standing. “The girl is more than capable of taking care of herself,” he said. “Besides I’m not the one that decided to get into a fight or engage in that type of risky behavior that led to the fight.”<br />
<br />
Claudia and Marjorie both winced as they looked up Tom. “Sir,” Claudia croaked. “I was only sticking up for a friend.”<br />
<br />
Tom narrowed is eyes. “A friend huh,” he growled. “Tell me Claudia. This friend of yours, is it that girl you’ve been having a secret relationship with. I’ve told you I’m am not comfortable with that sort of behavior in my home.”<br />
<br />
“But dad...”<br />
<br />
“But nothing,” he yelled. “You will cease this activity at once young lady.”<br />
<br />
Claudia hung her head while Marjorie continued to clean Claudias wounds. “We just worry about you dear,” she whispered. “We want what’s best for you and worry that this sort of thing could hurt you down the line.”<br />
<br />
Lisa cleared her throat as she attempted to get Tom and Majorie’s attention. “If I could just interrupt for a moment,” she said. “I’ve recently had to deal with this sort of thing with my niece. Unfortunately you really can’t control what goes on in a persons heart.”<br />
<br />
Tom huffed and rolled her eyes. “I appreciate you helping our daughter miss but no offense I decide what is best for my daughter.”<br />
<br />
Katie, Kellie and the others now watched as the adults began to talk. Mary Elise shook her head as she listened. “Ugh the Major is never going  to go for this,” she moaned. “He’s too old school he doesn’t believe in that sort of thing.”<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at Katie before motioning to follow her. Slowly the two stepped away from the group to talk. “What,” Katie whispered. Kellie looked her girlfriend square in the eye before glancing down at the ring. “Do you think that could help in anyway?”<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the ring, unsure if their was anything she really could do. “I don’t know,” she sighed. “I really don’t want to mess with his age. It is Claudia’s dad after all.”<br />
<br />
“What about changing his mindset,” Kellie asked. “He has an old way of thinking. Do you think you could change his mind by giving him a more youthful and open mind.”<br />
<br />
“Like make him think he’s younger than he is?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Kellie hissed. “Just giving him a more modern view of the world. A younger view of the world I suppose.”<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the ring and thought about it. If the ring could alter someone’s age could it also alter their mindset? Not change the person physically but give them a newer, more modern view of the world. Sighing Katie looked at her girlfriend. “I guess it’s worth a shot.”<br />
<br />
Looking at Tom Katie made a wish for him to have the world view of a man 30 years younger. As the ring tingled Katie looked on in anticipation. Tom physically did not seem to change but they could see his stance begin to soften as his eyes went from stern disapproval to concern. Sighing the Major slowly approached his daughter.<br />
<br />
“Claudia,” he stated. “Listen, I know that you can’t choose who you fall in love with but your mother and I are concerned. This is something others might not be as accepting of. We just want you to be safe.”<br />
<br />
Claudia looked at her father confused. Her father was usually so old in his thinking and conservative in his beliefs. That he would almost seem accepting of her relationship surprised her. Before she could say anything she realized what had happened. Katie or Kellie had done something to her father. Shocked she nodded her head and looked at her father. “So your okay with me and Mika?”<br />
<br />
Tom frowned as he looked at his daughter. “I’m as comfortable as any man would be if his daughter was secretly dating someone he had yet to be introduced too.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smirked and hung her head. “I’m sorry sir,” she said. “I should not have kept my relationship with Mika a secret.”<br />
<br />
Tom folded his arms across his chest and smiled. “Apology accepted,” he stated. “I am glad that all those self defense lessons I gave you seems to have paid off.”<br />
<br />
Claudia laughed as Marjorie gave her husband a stern look. “Tom,” she said sternly. “You should not condone her fighting.”<br />
<br />
Tom grinned as he held his hands up. “I’m not condoning it Marjorie, I’m just happy she can take care of herself.”<br />
<br />
Lisa stared in shock at Tom. Happy that Claudia’s father seemed to be open to accepting Claudia for who she was. “So can I offer you two some coffee?”<br />
<br />
Tom nodded. “I think coffee sounds appropriate,” he said. “It will give my wife and I time to talk with our daughter and her girlfriend and what I expect from this relationship.”<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at Katie in admiration. “I can’t believe you pulled that off,” she beamed. Katie shrugged non chalantly as she looked out at Claudia and her parents. “I can’t believ it either,” she said. “Guess I’m starting to get pretty good with this thing.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she kissed her girlfriend. “I’ll say,” she purred. “Now let’s see if we can join everyone in the living room.” Katie nodded as the group slowly walked out to meet Claudia and her parents.</p>
