<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;ve changed the starting date from New Year&#39;s Day to a random autumn day so I could put in more creative structuring into it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a sunny autumn morning in the house of the Howard family. Josh, who happened to be 19 years old, woke up in his quaint bedroom as usual and went to his bathroom to conduct his morning routine. After he was cleaned and brushed his teeth, he got dressed and went downstairs to have breakfast with his family. “Good morning sweetie, how did you sleep last night?” asked his mother, Caroline, who was serving the family breakfast at the dining room table. “I slept okay.” He responded as he sat down. “That’s good.” Caroline then sat down with the rest of the family as they were eating breakfast, in which she helped her baby daughter, Emily, cut her sausages. <br />
<br />
Emily giggled as the sausages were being fed to her, as she loved how yummy they were. After she ate most of the sausages, she then ate the Cheerios that were on her colorful plate and later washed it down with her bottle. She felt happy altogether as today was her second birthday, as her mom was planning to do something special for her in the house. “Joshy, I know that you want to be alone, but could you help me decorate the house for your sister’s party today.” He groaned as even though he loved his baby sister, he would rather spend the time playing video games in his room or go outside to see a movie. <br />
<br />
“Sure, mom.” He accepted the favor though, as he felt like his mom won’t bother him as much after they were done decorating. After they were done eating breakfast, Caroline put Emily in the living room as she turned on the TV for her to watch. Josh on the other hand, was just waiting for his mom to get the things out on the backyard so they could get ready to start decorating. It took them a while, as they had to setup the tables and put up the “Happy Birthday” above the backyard doors. But they felt relieved as the hard part was over for them. <br />
<br />
“Alright, could I finally go now?” Josh asked his mom, as Caroline didn’t like how it was said but accepted it anyway. “Sure, sweetie.” He then went upstairs where he turned on his computer and played on it for a while. “Finally, the most stressful part is done. I’m so glad that I don’t have to do this often.” He thought to himself as he booted up a game from his Steam library and proceeded to play. <br />
<br />
A little while after, Caroline had Emily dressed so she could look presentable for her birthday party. Emily made it a bit difficult however, as she only wanted to watch her favorite show that was on TV. She then distracted Emily with one of her favorite toys, as she finally got her white dress on her. Not long after, she heard some knocks on the front door. Caroline then went there to find that a couple of the moms were present. “Oh hello. I’m so glad that you come.” She greeted to the mothers of Harold and Peter, as they soon went to the backyard where the party was. “Emily, your friends are here to play with you.” Caroline told her, as Emily was excited to see her friends.<br />
<br />
They were soon guided to go outside where the party was, as they played together for a while. The mothers were standing nearby, watching them so they won’t go too rough. Emily and her friends meanwhile were playing a game of tag, as they ran around the grass and felt happy about themselves. Mark eventually got out of the cake from the kitchen with Josh’s help, where everybody was excited to see it as he placed it on the table.<br />
<br />
After everybody sang Happy Birthday to Emily, Candice blown out the candle and everybody start to devour the cake once they’ve gotten the slice. Given how Emily and her friends liked sweets, they absolutely loved how the cake tasted. Especially as it was a chocolate cake with vanilla frosting. As everyone was done eating their slices of the cake, Emily was excited to open her presents. One present that she admired was a blue dog that has a heart shaped nose and was outstandingly fuzzy to her. <br />
<br />
“Babbu!” She exclaimed as she hugged her new toy. It came from a cartoon called Sweetiepies, which was Emily’s favorite show. The other toddlers were interested in the stuffed toy, even though Emily was a bit hesitant to share it because it did belong to her. After that, Emily and her friends played with the toy until most of them felt tired after a long day of playing. “Looks like some of you needs to take their naps.” Caroline cooed at the babies. The parents then took the goodie bags with them, as they left the house knowing that they had a good time.<br />
<br />
After they left, Caroline took Emily to her bedroom where she noticed her diaper was lumpy after some usage and changed it immediately. She then put Emily in her crib where she rested peacefully. Caroline later exited the room, where she later went downstairs to start making dinner for the family.</p>
