<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun began its lazy rise over the horizon, heralding the start of a new day.<br />
Soon Sunday, October 25th would officially begin, with six full days left before the showdown at the Jennifer Harper/Harold Jenkins wedding between her family and her would be suitor Dieter Wilhelm.<br />
<br />
But thoughts and fears of that event were still far off as Peter Talbot stirred in his bed. Dreams of his girlfriend Karen Yuletide as his wife and lioness, along with the children they would eventually have and raise filled his mind, even as Peter&#39;s leonine tail twitched happily against his furry body.<br />
Karen was Jenny Harper&#39;s best friend, dorm mate, and Maid of Honor at the upcoming wedding. Peter would be there as Karen&#39;s &quot;Plus One&quot; and had already discussed the werelions of Moon Lake assisting with security at the wedding with his father, the acknowledged &quot;Lion King&quot;, but everyone had to be careful because no matter what happened, the secret that Moon Lake was a were sanctuary must be maintained at all costs.<br />
<br />
As the early rays began to crest the top of the trees surrounding the town&#39;s namesake, Alex Ramsey started to stir.<br />
Realizing that the sun was beginning to rise, he turned to the sleeping werewolf in his arms and said, &quot;Come on stud. Wake up. We&#39;ve got to get back to the tent before the sun fully rises or be in trouble for risking the revelation of weres in public. Unless you&#39;d like to switch back to our human forms now and go back to the tent barefoot, along with the risk of being arrested for public nudity,&quot; he added, since the bottom of werewolf feet were tougher than a human&#39;s.<br />
&quot;Okay handsome,&quot; said his boyfriend Nate Anderson with a yawn, before kissing his lover good morning.<br />
&quot;We can continue that back in the tent, but we do have to go,&quot; said Alex, standing and stretching.<br />
&quot;Okay. I could use some good loving and a few more hours sleep,&quot; said Nate, eyeing Alex&#39;s fur covered sheath since his werewolf penis was now at eye level as Nate sat up. &quot;I just have one question for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; wondered Alex, as he helped Nate stand up.<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Alice?&quot; to which Alex&#39;s only answer was to wrap his furry arms around his boyfriend and begin to cry.<br />
<br />
As werefox Harry Jenkins came back into the bedroom he had for years within his parents house, he could not help staring at the beautiful form of his were-vixen fiance Jenny Harper laying in his bed.<br />
He never bothered looking at the clock on his night stand. Harry simply held Jenny close to him as she twitched in her sleep, troubled by whatever dream she had.<br />
<i>At least they&#39;re not waking her up in the middle of the night anymore,</i> he thought happily, crawling back into bed to be with her.<br />
What should be the happiest day of their life approaching might turn out to be a nightmare, depending upon how serious her family and the creep they wanted Jenny to marry were about trying to stop the wedding.<br />
But the whole town was on their side. The only (justified) concern being to make sure the secret of Moon Lake stayed hidden during the impending showdown at the church on Saturday.<br />
The only thing Harry could promise was that Jenny was going to be Mrs. Harold Jenkins happily forever after by this Saturday night, or anyone that tried to stop them would risk joining the ranks of the deceased.<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson was now well used to being able to talk, breathe, see, and hear underwater as a were-mer just as easily as he could on dry land as a regular human being, but waking up every morning with Julie Stovall (someday to be Julie Anderson) in his arms was his greatest joy and a pleasure Eric hoped he would never take for granted.<br />
&quot;Good morning my love,&quot; said Julie, smiling at him before giving Eric a passionate lover&#39;s kiss. &quot;Did you sleep well?&quot;<br />
&quot;With you? Always my Jewel,&quot; he replied, before hugging Julie closer to him. Being were-mers underwater and the Stovalls having a privacy fence around their backyard, the lovers didn&#39;t have to worry about exposing the were secret in public here.<br />
&quot;I saw your little token on the pool edge,&quot; said Julie, referring to where Eric left her were-mermaid birth control pills and a bottle of water before rejoining her after he last answered nature&#39;s call. &quot;A tad early for today because the sun is just now beginning to rise,&quot; she added, indicating the faint hint of light appearing on the water surface above them, &quot;but I went ahead and took it now because we don&#39;t want to endanger our future time line together,&quot; said Julie, remembering the shared dreams they&#39;ve had about getting married and eventually raising a family together.<br />
&quot;True, but I am seriously looking forward to spending the rest of my life with you,&quot; said Eric, before lowering his head just enough to kiss the single pearl of the necklace around her neck, the were-mer token of an engaged mermaid.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; agreed Julie, while playfully running her fingers through his hair. &quot;But there&#39;s no rule that says we can&#39;t enjoy the present. Besides, it will be a few hours yet before mom wakes up, let alone comes looking for us in regards to breakfast,&quot; she said with a smile, as Julie started to move her hand lower down Eric&#39;s body.<br />
&quot;Then my only question is here or back in the cabana?&quot; asked Eric, as he felt the stirrings in his loins begin.<br />
&quot;Why not both?&quot; asked his fiance in return, before kissing him again.<br />
<br />
Frances Twist woke up, disentangled herself from her mate, and quietly made her way to the bathroom.<br />
She had had that... interesting dream again. That someday Frances would carry a child, bring it to full term, birth a beautiful girl who would one day be a werecat herself, and...<br />
The last bit was the hardest to believe, as she returned to the bedroom and stared at her sleeping mate.<br />
Frances was a happy lesbian, joyfully married to Samantha Twist, the Moon Lake Town Chancellor.<br />
Yet besides being co-mommy, someday her wife would also be the biological &quot;father&quot; of their child???<br />
As wonderful as creating and raising a child with the woman she loved would be, Frances realized that was just not medically possible by today&#39;s standards; not knowing Jenny Harper&#39;s secret of the were-vixen also being a potential mystic healer who would one day actually grant Frances&#39; fondest wish.<br />
Shaking her head in disbelief, Frances crawled back into bed, kissed her wife on Samantha&#39;s furry cheek, and then repositioned herself to fall back asleep in Samantha&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
Ben Twist felt something wonderful, yet totally unfamiliar.<br />
Someone furry was not only lying against his werewolf form, she was kissing him awake as well.<br />
Groggily, he opened his eyes to see the smiling form of the werepanthress he loved.<br />
&quot;Good morning, my darling Benjamin,&quot; said Kenya Adaeze, kissing him again. The gray of her werepanthress form an interesting contrast to his black werewolf fur.<br />
&quot;Good morning to you too,&quot; he said, after kissing her in return. &quot;But if the sun&#39;s starting to rise, we should...&quot;<br />
&quot;Sshh...&quot; said Kenya, while putting a furry finger against his muzzle. &quot;The first light is just beginning to appear through the trees. While we shall have the whole day together to enjoy each other&#39;s company, we still have a little time left to add a final memory to our wonderful night together.&quot;<br />
With that, she smiled at him again as she shifted positions and the next thing Ben knew, the werepanthress was slowing mounting her werewolf.<br />
&quot;Remember, ease into the moment. Let the passion slowly build the enjoyment for both of us until that grand moment of climax,&quot; instructed Kenya, as she began a gentle rocking motion of her hips to bring his lupine rod in and out of her at a leisurely pace.<br />
Ben just smiled and caressed her breasts with one paw as the other slowly traveled up and down the length of Kenya&#39;s body, gently stroking her fur.<br />
&quot;By the way,&quot; said Kenya, looking down at her lover. &quot;You talk in your sleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;I do?&quot; asked Ben ,confused. &quot;No one&#39;s ever been with me long enough to say that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then I shall be the first, and the last,&quot; she said cryptically with a smile as she moved closer to whisper in Ben&#39;s ear. &quot;After you turn 18 and have graduated high school, when you can officially ask me what you truly want to, my answer shall be yes.&quot;<br />
With that, Kenya kissed her boyfriend on the tip of his muzzle before raising her head back up to start stroking his furry chest with her paws.<br />
If not for the fact that he was in his fursona right now, Ben would be seriously blushing at the moment as both thought of what the future would hold for Kenya Adaeze Twist.<br />
<br />
Martha and William Anderson awoke to the sounds of Dawn and Douglas Hale having sex nearby.<br />
The werefox was taking his vixen from behind, something Dawn was enjoying immensely.<br />
Martha whispered in her husband&#39;s ear, and then the werecat crawled over and under Dawn to initiate a 69 position of mutual oral sex with her.<br />
While she still had some reservations about having any man&#39;s penis other than her husband&#39;s enter her, Martha had already tasted Douglas&#39; sperm from his wife&#39;s gooey cunt and didn&#39;t mind sampling it again as the werefox continued to fuck his mate.<br />
Not to be outdone, fellow werefox William Anderson came over and was about to begin having sex with his wife, when Dawn Hale grabbed his cock and began to suck that tasty vulpine penis.<br />
When it was even harder than before, she reluctantly removed it from her mouth and inserted it into Martha&#39;s wet cunt before she resumed orally pleasing the bi-werecat.<br />
Neither Anderson said anything about Dawn&#39;s actions, because Martha had promised herself that she would start sharing her women with her husband.<br />
Once everyone involved finished shuddering from orgasmic bliss, they laid side by side in the grass, the top knots of their men still lodged deeply within their wives.<br />
When everyone was finally able to separate, Dawn sat up, looked at Martha, and asked, &quot;May I clean it?&quot; while staring at William&#39;s vulpine cock.<br />
Feeling a bit daring and remembering her promise, Martha replied, &quot;Only if I can clean Douglas&#39;.&quot; An offer to which Mister Hale readily agreed.<br />
Back to furry back, tails twitching against each other, each woman licked and sucked the other man&#39;s cock until they both came within their new partner&#39;s furry muzzle.<br />
From enjoying Dawn&#39;s furry chalice, Martha already knew what Douglas&#39; cum tasted like, but would admit that it did taste a little better coming straight from the source. Something Dawn would make a similar comment about later when asked about William&#39;s sperm.<br />
Thinking that this might be a good time to ask Martha if she was finally willing to take the last step and make this a true orgy, Dawn was about to ask Martha if she wanted to have sex with Douglas when William said, &quot;Hey. The sun&#39;s coming up.&quot;<br />
Realizing what that meant, Douglas said, &quot;We&#39;ve got to get back to your place before dawn or be in violation of the town&#39;s rules about being furry in public.&quot;<br />
With that, everyone stood and dusted themselves off. Anderson kissed Anderson while Hale kissed Hale.<br />
Then Martha and Dawn kissed before linking arms. Douglas took his wife&#39;s free hand while William did the same with Martha, and together the foursome walked back to the Anderson house to plan their day from there.</p>
