<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Most of the Derrick, Jason and Tim material was written by Transformatus. I&#39;m only including it here because I want to change what happened to Teacher Dick and tie it into the Derrick, Jason, and Tim material.<br/>
<br/>
I did also make a few other minor changes such as the Long John backstory.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If it hadn&#39;t been obvious by now, each human had a different reaction. Although the subliminal messaging sent by the mother ship had made men more willing to be dicked, it did not create a desire that the men did not already have. That would have defeated the whole purpose of Hugo&#39;s experiments. Hugo was surprised that so many men had a desire to be dicked but Hugo was not surprised that each man had different forms of denial or justifications.<br />
<br />
When Hugo had started his experiment weeks ago, he expected men to claim that they didn&#39;t want to be dicks. He thought he would hear arguments like &quot;I&#39;m a man, not a dick.&quot; or &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do anything so sick and degenerate.&quot; Hugo expected men to resist because of some form of pride, too proud to be a dick. That&#39;s why Hugo was surprised by Teacher Dick&#39;s response which was more scientific inquirty and less pride.<br />
<br />
Hugo did notice Teacher Dick&#39;s suspicion about alien technology but then Teacher Dick scolded himself telling himself that alien theories were nonsense. So Hugo decided to just make sure Teacher Dick went to a student.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Derrick hunched as he held Jason and Tim&#39;s shoulders. They were speaking in hushed tones, counting the money they had between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I didn&#39;t come prepared for much,&quot; Tim admitted, looking both pained and very aroused. His pants had a tent in the front. <br />
<br />
Derrick understood, he really did. His own pants felt sinfully tight and restrictive. His mouth was dry, and he had to try not to think too hard about his last grinding sessions with both of them. About how Tim&#39;s thin, wired body felt under him, how oppressive Jason&#39;s beefcake body weighted on top of his back when he thrusted into his ass... <br />
<br />
Fuck, he thought. Not helping myself. <br />
<br />
Derrick squirmed a bit, missing the glint of lust in Jason&#39;s eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me take the lead here, okay?&quot; Jason said. &quot;I promise I&#39;m gonna get us something we can all have fun with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim nodded, and Derrick realized he&#39;d missed something. Blushing, he pretended nothing was wrong and nodded to Jason. Besides, he was so thirsty he probably wouldn&#39;t make any intelligent bid.<br />
<br />
They separated as Frank the physics teacher, or the physics prick-cher as it was now, announced the beginning of the bidding. <br />
<br />
It was ridiculous, really. Hugo had tied a little bowtie around Frank&#39;s shaft and held him up against a prop, so it looked like a cock-magician was on stage to animate the evening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, gentlemen and sluts!&quot; he started to the general chuckling. &quot;Let us begin our special auction to fund Hugo&#39;s scientific breakthrough in biological manipulations with our volunteer of the night, the one, the only... TEACHER DICK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick snickered as Hugo put Teacher Dick on a platform and a photo appeared on the white screen behind them. The magnified shot of Teacher Dick was lined with stats on the side of the screen. Derrick read them with an appreciative hum: &quot;Seven inch, bouncy balls, clean shaven, uncut. Starting bid: Forty bucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing rose from his right, and Derrick saw Jason lowering his head in an attempt to stay quiet. Derrick himself was relieved. Forty bucks sounded affordable, and Teacher Dick was not a bad cock at all. <br />
<br />
Frank&#39;s drawling voice boomed through the auditorium&#39;s speakers. &quot;Now, Teacher Dick is a very curious cock, by which I mean that the buyer should be someone with desires to experiment and push the limit of cockhood in a short amount of time. Bidding starts forty bucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty!&quot; someone immediately shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;And here we go!&quot; Frank replied animatedly. &quot;Do I hear sixty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seventy!&quot; another, much more mature voice cut in but Hugo stepped up and said, &quot;I am sorry sir but I think it&#39;s best if we let only students bid on this one. There will be plenty of others to chose from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another student bid sixty and the bidding continued with just students. Gordon happened to be sitting next to Tim. Derrick got a first hand look at Gordon who was a lanky, nerdy type. Gordon also looked to be mixed race although Derrick couldn&#39;t be sure which races mixed in Gordon. He did not look Hispanic but more Asian, Polynesian.<br />
<br />
The back and forth between the two bidders began, quickly reaching an impressive two hundred and fifty. That bid was met with a few seconds of stunned silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sold for two hundred and fifty to Gordon, the brightest engineering student in school. A round of applause for our new proud owner of Teacher Dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
The lanky Gordon stepped on the stage without hesitation, shaking Hugo&#39;s hands before taking hold of Teacher Dick. He studied Teacher Dick like he was studying a computer app. Even after sitting down, his eyes were glued to Teacher Dick.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Teacher Dick had been given a communication ship and was using it to talk to Gordon. &quot;I&#39;m trying not to cum. I&#39;m a teacher, not a dildo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gordon said, &quot;But you&#39;re a dick. You don&#39;t have arms or legs or lungs or a stomach. I should really see how much of a dick you are. If I could get a hold of some medical equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason heard this and said, &quot;I&#39;m in the medical department. I can get you what you need. What are you thinking of?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gordon said, &quot;Is there a probe we can put in the dick slit to see his insides?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;You mean a sounding rod or a camera?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gordon said, &quot;Either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teacher Dick gulped but it would further his understanding of the dicking technology. He didn&#39;t want to admit that the idea of being skewered was also turning him on. He choked back the cum and said, &quot;That sounds like an excellent idea. I should have a straight urethra until it gets to where the bladder should be but I obviously don&#39;t have a bladder so I wonder what you will run into.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gordon said, &quot;We should also get a semen sample to see how normal his semen is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teacher Dick, &quot;In the name of science . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Gordon said, &quot;We should repeat these tests too, sometimes with him attached to my groin and sometimes not, to see if that makes a difference. I should put together a team of people to try this dick out and see how realistic he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teacher Dick was silenced by his anxiety. Just how many guys was Gordon planning on? Teacher Dick had a hard time convincing himself that Gordon was doing this for science.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Frank continued. &quot;And now, the main attraction of the night, our auction items.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo propped up a few cue cards before Frank. <br />
<br />
On stage, a light spot shone on a dick in a box, not unlike a regular dildo in a sex shop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our first bid will be Jonathan &#39;Long John&#39; Morrison!&quot; In the background, a video played of Jonathan, as an athlete, running, swimming, and lifting weights. <br />
<br />
Derrick shifted a little and tried to move his cock in a more comfortable position. He could feel the wet spot spreading near his boxer&#39;s waistband. <br />
<br />
&quot;Long John&#39;s long time dream has always been to be a professional body builder but he has changed his mind. He now wants to be a professional body builder&#39;s dick. So this is your opportunity to have the dick of a professional body builder for a limited time before he&#39;s sent off to the winner of an upcoming competition. Starting bid of fifty bucks. Her we go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty!&quot; A man two rows behind Derrick shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seventy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eighty!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so on, before Long John was acquired by a fat guy who spent a lot of time watching body building competitions.<br />
<br />
Hugo then brought out a drool-worthy cock, holding him by the balls and letting the thick meat swing back and forth until he propped him up on the podium and a new video of someone bouncing on the dick appeared in the background. Helpless moans rang through the room, and Derrick knew he saw someone slipped their hands into their pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;Colton &#39;Big Gun&#39; Bundy&#39;s life is a mess. He can&#39;t get any despite his big tool. He is failing his exams. He might need to move out of his apartment. Thus, Big Gun has given up on humanity and has chosen to abandon himself to dickhood. Big Gun&#39;s new owner must replace their previous penis with Big Gun, which will be done by Hugo after the auction. Big Gun wants to be nothing more than someone&#39;s giant fuckstick and forget he ever was a failure of a man. Auction begins at one hundred!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick grabbed Jason&#39;s arm and pulled frantically. &quot;Jason, I want that one. I have to have that one!&quot;<br />
<br />
At five inches, he was always a little embarrassed compared to Jason who was a thick meaty eight inches long. Just the thought of being the bigger one for once made his dick ooze more pre. <br />
<br />
&quot;One fifty!&quot; a jerk from the front row raised his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two hundreds!&quot; replied another voice from the back of the auditorium.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason!&quot; Derrick called desperately. He *needed* Big Gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three hundred bucks, and both of my friends as dicks!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s head whipped around to Jason. &quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sold for three hundreds, and two dicking!&quot; Frank declared from atop the podium.<br />
<br />
Drones floated down from the ceiling, stopping right before Derrick and Tim. He was almost as shocked at Jason&#39;s declaration as he was when Tim grinned widely and opened his arms wide before the drone. A flash of light hid him from view for a split second, only enough to reduce him to a thin, curvy six inch penis.<br />
<br />
His heart beating madly in his chest, Derrick turned to the metal disc floating before him. &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t agree to th-&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s words died out as the lens let out the flash, and he suddenly lost the ability to speak. <br />
<br />
To Derrick, it seemed like the transformation was in slow motion. He could feel himself sliding down his clothes. the whole auditorium had become the size of an open football field, the chairs as high as two stories houses, and the titan&#39;s foot near his head could only belong to Jason. An attempt to crawl away did nothing. He couldn&#39;t even lift the circus tent that was slowly drifting down on top of him. He couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t speak... He... He had been turned into his penis. <br />
<br />
His balls clenched. Fuck. That felt incredible... <br />
<br />
Hands lifted the clothes away and shone light on him again. With a smile, Jason brought him to his giant lips, massaging his balls with rough, calloused fingers, and gently kissed the top of his dickhead. &quot;Come on, Derrick, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got a plan. Gordon, I&#39;ll help you with medical suppies if you work on figuring out how dicking tech works. I don&#39;t think Hugo will share and I have a bad vibe about trying to challenge him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick meanwhile was cursing Jason, thinking that if he was going to be turned into a cock, he should be turned into a bigger cock.</p>
