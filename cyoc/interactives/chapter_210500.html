<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Then let’s make them part of my act!” <br />
<br />
Looking back at the 8 year old boy and girl and then to the audience and said “so how can these two be part of my act?” the ring master put an hand up to his ear like he is listening for suggestions, he heard. <br />
<br />
Lots of then some of them ok ideas some of them weird like “make them show girls”, or “make them both midgets”, he did not like any of them an till one person said something what made him smile and new that was the one, “someone shouted “make them you sons!” he liked that idea, he always wanted to have kids but never had time to find someone to love and he would never have enough time to look after a baby, but this could work out perfectly, he could make them his kids, who work in his circus! and make them love it as well. <br />
<br />
it was surprising how he has never thought of this before and said “I heard someone say, make them my twin gymnastics boys” with him twisting the shout out making it more fitting for him, wanting them both to be boys and identical twins would be better, and boy children are known to be easy to teach and work with in show business <br />
<br />
 So, he looked at the two children still in a trance and said “Jared, Tayla can you still here me?” with both of them saying in a plane tone “yes”, and he carried on saying “Tayler you are now called Tim and Tyla your name is now Tom, ok?” with both Tom and Tim saying Yes in the same tone as before, and then he again carried on “Tim, Tom you are both going to be my identical twin boys who will be my sons, and be known as the gymnasium boys, putting on shows every night at this circus showing off your athletic and balancing skills”. <br />
<br />
And after he said that, the boy and girl started to change growing a bit becoming the same hight at the same time, and Tim who was already a boy started to become more muscular and his hair grew out a little bit turning in to a dirty blond colour and his hair being put in to a small ponytail, his face became much smoother looking and much cuter with makeup appearing on it making him look like a show kid now, with his clothes fusing together and becoming a boy&#39;s leotard what looked like shiny stretchy white shorts connected to a bright blues tank-top what was now just one peace showing of his smooth arms and legs. <br />
<br />
At the same time Tom who is the girl went throw the same but her hair got sucked in to her head instead of out and a bulge appeared in her girl now boy underwear, with her now his whole body become the complete opposite gender with him now looking just like his now twin brother, except now wearing a red top, white bottom boy&#39;s leotard. <br />
<br />
The ring leader smiled thinking they are perfect hearing the audience clap thinking this was only a trick, they were perfect to him, they look like child acters and strong enough to be able to do a performance for the crowd, looking at their muscles and athletic body&#39;s now, and said loud a enough so the audience to hear “Tom, Tim you will wake up and remember you are on the stage to do you performance&quot; and then he clicked his fingers and the two boys looked shocked for a split second and then smiled remembering where they are and what they are doing and ran to the centre of the stage and  started to do their performance, and what a performance it was, there where back flips off each other&#39;s backs and handstands on top of heads with only one hand and throwing each other around and lots of other thing. <br />
<br />
during the performing&#39;s the audience was going crazy clapping, whistling and cheering, Tom and Tim did not know why the audience was so alive to night but they weren&#39;t going to complain getting more cheers than they normally get so they carried on an till the end, with both of them out of breath and giving a bow before running off the stage to the side where there dad is waiting for them seeing a big smile on his face and said “great job boys great job” with the boys smiling knowing how their dad is always there and without him neither of them would be able to do the thing they both love, and gave him a hug saying “thanks dad.”  <br />
<br />
And he walked them back to their tent where they live while Tim said” at the start of this performance I felt kind of odd? but it seemed like we did a good job, the crowd has never been like that with us before, right Tom?” with Tom nodding his head and said yer dad!” the ring leader just said “well I guess you must have finely gotten it all perfect and the audience saw, and don’t worry about feeling a bit foggy at the beginning, it happens to the best of us, just tell me if it happens again ok?” with the ring leader making easy excuses for the odd behaviour they saw today, and it did not help that the rest of the circus performers were looking at his two new sons like strangers and with his two sons having memories growing up with these people all their life&#39;s and new he would have to put them all under and make them all think that Tim and Tom have been his sons since they were born, but is that what happens, maybe he should change himself or some more of his acts who knows?</p>
