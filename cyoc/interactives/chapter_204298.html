<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After you left the professor&#39;s lab you head out to a road outside your town, you decided you would sit down next to a tree while you check on your monster device to see the world map you also check out what else you have in your bag.<br />
<br />
You look in your bag and see that you got the items you need if you decided to camp out for the night. You also find some monster cubes than you remembered that these are important if you want to capture monsters and build your own team, it&#39;s also important to know that they not always work all the time if the monsters are strong, if you manage to weakened them then all you have to do is just throw one at the one you want and the cube will open and trap them, if the catch is successful the capsule will fully contain it and become part of your team.<br />
<br />
You also find the cube that is supposed to your partner&#39;s, then you look out of your bag to see what your wolf is doing it looks like he wondering around sniffing at everything and getting all new kinds of smells.<br />
<br />
You where about to call him over but then it made you realize you haven&#39;t give him a name, after you realized it you just say a command.“ Here boy you” called out to him he heard your call and come right over to you as you begin to rub his head as you say to him. “ You need a name so I won&#39;t mistake you for another wolf monster,” you thought about it for awhile and all that came to you is this “how about <br />
I call you Ace” you said to him. It took a minute for him to respond to it, then he bark out happily while you see his tail wagging. “Ace it is then” you said as you smile then he started to lick you that was when you drop your monster device.<br />
<br />
You pick up the device which is on the fusion setting it made you remember what the professor said, you can have fun with merging and can use it outside of battles. You want to try and get the hang of merging with monsters, you looked back at Ace who sitting next to you, “ do you want to become one with me again? You ask Ace.” Ace tail started to wagging fast and bark happily while he lick your face “ I&#39;ll take that as a yes” you say while giggling. You activated the monster device <br />
and selected ace then you a white shine around you and Ace, you can feel something different from when you did this the first time, you can feel your thoughts being mix in with Ace and you can feel his being mix with your, while you and Ace mines are merging the rest of your body&#39;s are fusing together starting with your arms by growing gray fur with black nails just like before, after that your<br />
two pairs of nipples popped out from your chest below your breasts but you can feel them becoming slightly bigger than before, your feet was the next to change into wolf paws with a little bit of fur around your legs which was still human but it looks like it can help you walk on all fours, your ears turned into wolf ears, your wolf tail appeared above your butt and finally your nose becomes a snout.<br />
<br />
After the shine fade all that is left of Sally and Ace was this hybrid. “ Wow didn&#39;t that Merged felt amazing Sally?” you said out loud. “Yeah Ace it felt different than the first time” you said to yourself.” That is when you realize that you feel like something else about you is different from before. You walk over to a little lake and you saw your reflection in the water, you remembered that Sally&#39;s eyes were blue, you also remember seeing Ace&#39;s eyes were brown, getting a good look at yourself in the reflection you can see that this fusion has one of both, the right side have Sally&#39;s blue eye while the left side have Ace&#39;s brown eye. You look down to see the rest of your new body, you can see your breasts which is covered by your fur, you can also tell that their slightly bigger then before. You continue to down your body that is when you get a look at between your legs, it was something familiar yet it was something unfamiliar for you to have it was a sheath and balls which have your new wolf cock inside which used to be Ace&#39;s. You move your hand to have a feel around them that is when you felt something behind your balls, it was your pussy that was used to be Sally&#39;s so that makes you a herm wolf hybrid.<br />
<br />
You look over to see your reflection again, you thought to yourself that not only parts of your body had changed but also your mind. You feel like your not only just Sally or just like Ace but both of them together.<br />
<br />
 “I am both Sally and Ace and their me” you said to yourself. “Is this type of fusing is part of the fusion settings?” you thought to yourself. “So I guess I can call myself in <br />
this form Sallce” you said to yourself while returning to your bag. You pick up your bag, let&#39;s see what this body can do you said to yourself as you begin to walk on all fours to continue your adventure.<br />
<br />
You continue to walk on the road while you getting in tune with your wolf instincts like getting all kinds of smells around you. That was when you a smell and your wolf ears heard flapping of wings, you went over to the source and that&#39;s when you find it, it was one of many <br />
Species bird monsters and this one looks like it resembles a pigeon. That made you think of the bat Gwen has, you wanted to know what it is like to have wings and fly so you decided to catch it. You approach it while it&#39;s drinking a little water it doesn&#39;t notice your presence thanks to your wolf instinct. You wonder if you could try and battle it but apart of you wanted to see how these monster cubes work and see if you could get lucky so you got one out of your bag, you approach the pigeon monster slowly from behind you ready your aim and you through it and it landed on the bird&#39;s back, that is when the capsule open up and a shining light surrounded the bird monster and it disappeared into the capsule. That&#39;s when you heard a beep move a little ....[BEEP].......[BEEP]...........[BEEP]................, That was when you heard a small click. “Yes! ” you said out loud that was when you heard a beep from your monster device, that must means that the bird monster&#39;s data was sent to your monsterdex which you&#39;ll check out later, you went over and pick up the cube you wanted to see if it&#39;s alright so you press the button on, light shine as it opens letting the bird monster out now that you have a closer look at it the bird monster is female. “W-what&#39;s going on what happen!?” the female bird said panicking. You were surprise to hear her talk but then when you think about it, it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that you can understand what monster say since you are part monster. The female bird looked around to see you standing in front of her, “W-who are you!?” the bird said in a panicking voice. “It&#39;s alright I won&#39;t hurt you” you said to the bird to calm down. “My name is sallce and I&#39;m a fusion of a trainer name Sally and a monster name Ace” you said to the bird while you show her the cube in your hand. “As you can see I have caught you but I wanted to see if you want to come on my journey” you said to the bird. The bird took a minute to think about it, “ok I would like to come with you” the bird said smiling at you. “thank you” you said to the bird while your tail wags. “Can I call you Sky?” you ask her ( I&#39;ll come up with the names of your new monsters for now and think of fusion names later). “That sounds lovely” the bird says happily. “Then Sky it is” you say to your new teammate.<br />
<br />
“I can say that this is a great start to your first day of your adventure I wonder what will come next” you thought to yourself.</p>
