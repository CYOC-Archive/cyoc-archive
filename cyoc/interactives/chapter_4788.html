<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;As a subject of your Master what must I do to get out of the stupid place?&quot; I asked getting a little pissed off.<br />
<br />
The doctor man looked at me and with a stern face said, &quot; The work to be done is one of aluring a weak man to be very friendly. He is middleaged and feeling alone in his life. A bit mixed up right now he looks for another way of life which would be less spiteful than his own. You are to suggest a course of action which will tantilize his physical drives for lust and sex. I will prepare you for this task!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at him rather astonished at his long oratory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enter this chamber and let us begin!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
I wanted out of that weird Hell hole and was prepared to go along with his nutty suggestions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please remove all clothing, jewelry, and anything you weren't born with and place it in the drawers.&quot; said the doctor as he worked on something.<br />
<br />
I bent over to slip my socks off when that big seringe stabbed me in the butt. A rush of wild chills and heat flashes ran all over my body. Of course I remember screaming about what he had done since this was a Fun House and not a true Lab experiment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell was that for?&quot; I screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Fjord!&quot; he stated which meant nothing to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, whats a Faaajahord ?&quot; I tired to pronounce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh a little trouble speaking, good that's a good sign!&quot; stated the man as he went about mixing things into a bowl.<br />
<br />
My lips felt numb and possibly swelling a bit. &quot;Hey I must be allergic to whatever you shot me with, look my lips!&quot; I pleaded for him to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO Samuel it's quite normal! In fact those lips should thicken even more till you can use them to help gather up foods.&quot; repied the doctor.<br />
<br />
I banged on the chamber's door to get out but found myself locked inside. &quot;Fo ahain Fhat's a Faahjord?&quot; I strained to form words.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Fjord is a type of pony from Norway. The breed is know well for it's sound conformation and smooth muscle. It resembles the Przewalski's horse. In your case a Dun colour with a black eel stirpe running down the back to a black tail. The mane is Dun coloured was the body hair and stands erect above the strong neck. The best part is that your testicles are almost hose size and the sheath is also large for a pony. The penis will be black in colour and eighteen inches in length. The flat ended glands flare very nice when fully erect. This will be a factor in your aluring people to play or suckle the member.  The Master has seen this type of sensual lusting in humans before and uses you and other willing subject to bring them over to his side of thinking.&quot; explained the doctor.<br />
<br />
I tried to speak but words came out as jumbled and mumbled with squeakie whinnies attached. The more he fussed with his bowl the more I felt very strange.<br />
<br />
Turning to me he had a gallon size bowl of what looked like a slurry of oils and grains. &quot;Chow this down and we will soon be ready to meet the light of day!&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at the bowl and then at him. The only way to get out of the Fun House now seemed to drink down this yucko stuff. Tipping the bowl to my thicken lips the taste was sweet and reminded me of a dark draft beer.<br />
<br />
I stood in the chamber and hung my wrists over the half door which kept me in the little room. The view of the doctor began to get fuzzy as he would walk to the far side of the Lab. I shook my head which seemed to make everything feel more in place but didn't clear my vision.<br />
<br />
He turned and smiled at me several times till he went to a cupboard and pulled out a large steel bucket. Pouring into it he popped a bottle of dark beer and mixed it with whatever came in the bucket.<br />
<br />
Slipping the bucket into my cell I looked down at the sweet smelling stuff. The bucket was full to the brim with wheat, oats, and rye grains. At first i looked back at the doctor only to turn my head down and begin to eat the bucket clean.<br />
<br />
Ah what a taste the grain gave off it made something deep in me feel alive. As the doctor had said my lips now worked better than hands and gathered the food into my mouth for chewing. As I sniffed the lite flax was sucked up my nose till it bothered me. A strong exhale of breath out my nose brought me into reality.<br />
<br />
I snorted ! The sound was like the heavy breathe of a horse blowing out his nostrils. I looked at the doctor who was showing a big smile.<br />
<br />
This made me nervous and soon my attention turned to a wisking feeling touching my butt. A strained look over my back brought the sight of that black hairy streak along my backbone to a thick black tail swinging about.<br />
<br />
Still balanced over the door's sill I looked down to see broad smooth Dun coloured hairy thighs and hind feet with hoofs. I quickly moved my right arm to get a possible view of a hand. Yet the resulting sight was of a fore leg of a pony with a bit of black feathering hairs over a hoof.<br />
<br />
I shook my head as thoughts began to get foggy and I felt very tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is to be expected Samuel J. Corbin, now you are a stallion pony of the Fjord breed. You must try to remember yourself even though those pony instincts will try to overcome the rational thoughts. If you are to be of continued service to the Master this mental war must be won by you and you alone. The beastly nature is tough but it has been overcome by many. However if you lose the battle and slide into the lower realm of beastial exsistance the don't expect even God to care for you!&quot; he warned.<br />
<br />
I was led out of the cell and stood stretching my massive and strong body. The original thoughts of being in a Fun House had withered and I knew my form to be that of a stallion pony. I know not but as I stood stretched long my animal lust welled to the surface. A feeling of crackly skin crinkling and tickling as I looked toward my hind quarters.<br />
<br />
The sight of a fuzzy sheath with a shaft of jet black skin was unfolding. I was amazed at the size, like a coke can around it gained length as it stiffened. Soon the monster shaft was out straight and lovingly hard. I tensed the sheath which made the shaft rise till it bumped my round belly. As I released the tension the thing swung down and bumped my hind legs. <br />
<br />
I walked in wide circles looking at the shaft of my dreams wag side to side making me all the harder and more and more horny. Shaking like a wet dog the shivers of sexual delight and a lust to find out how well this monster cock performed made me whinnie out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent Samuel, excellent, it's time you went to the corral up top and see if that shaft is worth you ultimate trip to Hell.&quot; suggested the doctor.</p>
