<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec arrived at the adventurers guild and went to the &quot;looking for group&quot; hall. It seemed less busy than last time he was here, but that could just be the time of day. Then<br />
The hall was huge with impressively high ceilings, you could&#39;ve parked an airplane in here and still have plenty of room. Looking around he found that there appeared to be multiple ways to advertise that you were looking for people.<br />
The simplest of which was a set of boards, not unlike the mission boards in the other hall where you could just leave your name and contact information. However, additionally the hall was clearly divided by the 4 wind directions. Each direction had several larger lobbies, furnished with a desk and some comfortable sofas. Large holographic signs mounted above a lobby made it clear what they were planning on doing. <br />
Dotted between In addition to the larger ones, there we also smaller lobbies for smaller parties. Finally there were people in the hallway either looking for a single partner, or waiting to be picked up.<br />
Once again he noticed that human was clearly not the only species in this world. As people of various sizes and colors walked around chatting, looking or just waiting. With horns, or tails or apparently even literal leaves for hair. What surprised him more was that the diversity here seemed to be larger than out into the town.<br />
He needed to go both east and west, so he decided to check those lobbies out.<br />
<br />
He arrived at the west area at one of the larger lobbies. It was filled with large men and women decked out in shiny heavy armor. The sign above mentioned them hunting a dragon and a minimum strength or mana requirement. Alec looked at his card, it briefly pulsed with light and a transparent marker appeared showing where the party was planning on going. <br />
Not that it mattered to him as he was nowhere near their requirements, but at least he got a sense of how this worked. He felt some of the large men and women in the lobby looking at him, but paid it no mind.<br />
Alec looked at the other lobbies. He sighed, did he really need to go to each lobby to check if the location was anywhere near where he needed to go. Wasn&#39;t there a quicker way to do this? Like a search engine or a filter? Maybe he should ask someone.<br />
He was on his way to the next area when a voice called out to hi,  &quot;Hey you!&quot;<br />
Alec turned around. A woman came walking towards him. She had a round face with soft features, her long brown hair was tied into a pony tail. She looked oddly familiar. She was a slender build, but her muscle tone was clearly visible. Alec&#39;s eyes went to her chest. Somehow she was sporting 3 pairs of large breasts despite looking fully human. <br />
The top pair was encased in armor, the middle and lower pair were covered in a bikini top which appeared to be tied haphazardly together. She jiggled impressively as she approached him. It suddenly dawned on him who this was.<br />
&quot;Hey ladiesman, how are you doing? Manage to get your curse off?&quot;<br />
Alec pulled his eyes up to meet her green eyes. &quot;No, unfortunately not. Apparently, it&#39;s not just a curse. Yours?&quot;<br />
&quot;What the hell do you mean is my curse off? What do you think when you look at me? Do I look curse free?!&quot; She put her hands on her hips and looked him straight in the eye.<br />
&quot;Err, sorry. Look, I can explain. See, I&#39;m not from around here and I didn&#39;t want to presume on what was normal and what not.&quot; He held up his card to hopefully prove it.<br />
&quot;Nationality unregistered? I&#39;ve never seen that before. It does at least explain your odd fashion sense. Sorry about getting angry...&quot; She relaxed her arms again and took another look. &quot;Alec. No, I&#39;m not supposed to look like this. My curse wasn&#39;t lifted either, they managed to reverse part of it and slow it down but I need to defeat the caster to permanently break this. Call me Vivian.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, slow? You mean you&#39;re still transforming?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not right now, but it will happen again.&quot; Her eyes were still on his card. &quot;You have a special skill? Amazing! Lucky bastard. So why are you looking for a group?&quot;<br />
&quot;I need to head west or east to get some supplies which should let the wizards guild help fix me.&quot;<br />
&quot;West or east? Well, I need to head west to the west swamp. The witch there cursed me. Your stats are pretty lacking, but special skills usually more than make up for that. Want to go at it together? Save my old teammates while we&#39;re at it, get a fat reward for killing the immortal witch.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kill the immortal witch? Is that curse affecting your head?&quot;<br />
She shrugged causing 4 of her breasts to jump. &quot;They call her immortal because she keep resurrecting after a period of time. She set up shop in the swamp for the excellent spell components that grow there so every now and then we, adventurers, kill her to clear the swamp and after a while the whole thing starts over.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you already failed?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but back then I didn&#39;t have you and your special skill. She dies the same as any other person, you just have to get her before she gets you. So what does possession allow you to do? Steal stuff?&quot;<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Alec hesitated briefly, but decided to tell her, &quot;I can take over another persons body.&quot;<br />
Her jaw nearly hit the floor. &quot;That&#39;s amazing. Can you possess anyone or anything?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think just humanoids. That&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve tried so far at least.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have a plan! Please help me and I sweat I will help you in return.&quot; she slapped her hands together in mock prayer.<br />
&quot;Well I do need to go to the witch&#39;s swamp.&quot; She seemed a bit rash, but at least she was experienced and she had a plan. &quot;But how do we get more people?&quot;<br />
&quot;I went with a bigger party last time and that just made it an easier target. The witch has eyes and ears everywhere. No, I want to try and do it silently, put an arrow between her eyes before she even knows what happened and you can help me. PLEASE.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine, okay, let&#39;s try this.&quot; If the worst would come he could always take the witch&#39;s body to stop her, provided she can&#39;t cast silence spells.<br />
&quot;Sweet! Thanks!&quot; She pumped her fist in the air.<br />
Together they left the guild. <br />
&quot;So how far is it to the swamp?&quot;<br />
&quot;About a 7 day hike, but we&#39;re going to cut that by 4 days by hitching a ride with a local caravan.&quot;<br />
<br />
They first picked up their gear and then he followed Vivian through the bustling streets of the city. They arrived at a familiar sight. It was the place where Alec had arrived with Ralof not that long ago. Wagons were scattered around the grey square. Live wild stock was being chased back into it&#39;s cage.<br />
Ralof however was nowhere to be seen, he had apparently already moved to the next town. It would&#39;ve been nice to see him again. Vivian approached a man who was shouting orders to some kids. He had a thick mustache and bushy grey eyebrows. As they approached, Alec immediately spotted the large man checking her out.<br />
&quot;Hi I&#39;m Vivian. We need a ride to the west swamp, I heard you were heading in that general direction. Do you have room for 2 more?&quot; Vivian asked.<br />
&quot;There is room, but what&#39;s in it for us?&quot; The man&#39;s gruff voice replied and from the way he was staring, Alec wasn&#39;t entirely sure what the answer was that the man was hoping for.<br />
&quot;We can help out and we&#39;ll pay obviously.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine. Go get those boxes loaded, I want to leave in half an hour and these kids can&#39;t do shit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes! Thanks! What can I call you?&quot; Alec was amazed at how energetic and happy Vivian was. <br />
&quot;Call me Boss.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on Alec, let&#39;s go get those crates for Boss.&quot;<br />
Vivian turned around and bounded towards the closest crate, with Alec quickly following behind her. <br />
&quot;Lucky bastard.&quot; Alec heard the man grumble behind him. <br />
Just as Alec took position on the opposite side of the crate to help lift it, Vivian effortlessly lifted the crate by herself. &quot;You take the other one.&quot; <br />
She had some rock hard muscles in those feminine arms. Alec attempted to lift the crate Vivian had indicated, but as it slowly lifted off the ground, he quickly dropped it and switched to a different one. To his relief, it was lighter and he quickly followed after Vivian.<br />
<br />
After the boxes had been loaded, Alec and Vivian were appointed a spot at the back of the last wagon. They traveled till dusk when the wagons were parked circular by the side of the road. They had plenty of time to talk now.<br />
Vivian doing most of it. She was a nearly endless fountain of words. Talking about where she was from in Alabaster and how she became an adventurer. She also asked many questions about the world Alec came from.<br />
After they set up camp Alec felt something he&#39;d feared. He needed to pee. He was not looking forward to a camping trip and not being able to just, whip it out.<br />
He managed to sneak away, crouched behind a bush, but then found himself struggling. His pants were around his ankles, how the hell do women pee without getting it over their pants or their feet? It felt like if he just squatted his behind should naturally be far away enough. <br />
But he struggled with his balance and felt insecure. In the back of his mind, time was ticking, he was taking to long. Vivian might come looking for him.<br />
Just to be safe, he removed his pants and sat with his feet as far away from his center as possible. The cool evening wind felt pleasant on his moist slit as he let it flow. He then awkwardly stepped away in crouching position and quickly put his pants back on. <br />
<br />
When he rejoined the caravan Vivian quickly came up to him. &quot;There you are. Little Alec needed to be taken for a walk?&quot;<br />
She was so direct. &quot;Yes.&quot; <br />
She smiled. &quot;Anyway, I was looking for you. How good are you with those weapons of yours? You said you didn&#39;t use them in your world. If you&#39;d like I can give you some lessons.&quot;<br />
Alec thought back to his &#39;fight&#39; with the harpies. He could really use the lessons, but he didn&#39;t want to come across as weak. &quot;I think I can manage, but if you have some tips I&#39;m open for them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds good, show me what you got. Get your blade, but keep it sheathed so you can&#39;t cut me.&quot;<br />
Alec pulled it out and did some strikes at Vivian, who gracefully dodged each and everyone of them. She seemed to be dancing around him, her 4 bottom breasts shaking wildly as she went. Alec felt like he was standing still while trying to hit the wind. Frustration mounted and he suddenly thrust at her. In the same moment as his thrust, she moved in, grabbed his wrist and turned her hip into his stomach. <br />
She pulled him over and before Alec knew what happened he was on the ground looking up at the underside of 3 pairs of boobs.<br />
&quot;You sucked man. Stop letting your dick do the thinking for you and let me help you.&quot; She held out her hand. <br />
Alec winced, this world was not good for his self esteem. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
She helped him up and they went to a nearby tree. <br />
&quot;Let&#39;s work on your pose first.&quot; Vivian got behind him. &quot;Spread those feet a little.&quot; She then grabbed his arm and pushed her 6 large breasts pushed against Alec&#39;s back as she moved his arm into position.<br />
With her guiding his arm she showed him how to strike at the tree. Each lunge he felt her warm heavy breasts rub his back. His crotch was tingling, he felt heat radiate from it as he got moist, yet for the first time he was happy he didn&#39;t have a dick. With her body rubbing against his, his pants would&#39;ve been much to tight now.<br />
<br />
The next two days they practiced whenever the caravan had a break. Alec managed to sneak off for a toilet break the first few times, but somehow Vivian seemed to be worried when she didn&#39;t immediately know where he was. So instead he occasionally mentioned he needed to take a dump. <br />
She still hadn&#39;t asked about his curse and he didn&#39;t feel like telling if he didn&#39;t have to.<br />
