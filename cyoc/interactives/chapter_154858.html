<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Queen of Mermaid Island arrives in the lagoon, accompanied as she always is by her two handmaidens, Thetis and Miryam, who had been a Greek priestess and a Phoenician trader&#39;s daughter in their long-ago-forgotten human lives, roughly three-thousand years ago. The two mermaid handmaidens are hardly aware now that they had ever once been women; their lot in life for countless unchanging years has been to serve their eternally-beautiful, immortal mermaid-queen, and they have served her faithfully and lovingly. In return, Queen Nephi has favored her maidens, and cherished and honored them above all the other mermaids in her realm.<br />
<br />
Once, long ago, the Queen had possessed a holy relic, a gift from her Goddess, the divine mermaid Atargatis. This relic was a special amulet, a holy symbol, which when worn about the neck allowed Queen Nephi—or any mermaid to whom the Queen deigned fit to lend the relic—to experience the pleasures of the flesh almost as readily as if she were a real woman again. But the Queen knew that the shape of a mermaid was a gift from Atargatis, and the price for wearing that divine form was an eternity of chastity—a sacrifice of her ability to fully feel the carnal pleasures. Only the high priestess of the Goddess, Queen Nephi herself, was exempt from this stricture, which was why she was given the amulet—so that she would not be bound and constrained as all the other mermaids were. But the powers of the amulet were meant for the Queen alone, and even though she *could* share them if she so desired, her Goddess&#39;s commandment forbade her from doing so. To that end, she mostly kept the amulet to herself, and kept its powers and it purpose a closely-held secret.<br />
<br />
But the millennia were long, and Nephi eventually came to love her two closest friends more than dearly. And so she committed a sin against her Goddess, once, countless centuries ago. In the height of a lustful passion, she lent to Thetis and then to Miryam her amulet, so that they too could experience female climax once again, in spite of the inherent limitations of their graceful and exquisitely beautiful mermaid forms. <br />
<br />
It was so long ago that these three mermaids last shuddered together in mutual orgasmic bliss that mortal men now count the years of that era backwards, and label them with &quot;B.C.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the consummation of their love, Queen Nephi knew that she and her handmaidens had sinned gravely, and that in order to remain in the favor of the Goddess, she herself would have to share in the mermaids&#39; sacrifice. And so she cast away her precious gift, the amulet that exempted her as high priestess from the commandment of Atargatis that mermaids must be chaste and never experience orgasm. The amulet was lost to her, and she imagined that was the end of it.<br />
<br />
Until, inevitably, she began to regret its loss.<br />
<br />
Down through the centuries, she searched and she searched, everywhere she could think to look, on and around and even deep within the island. Yes, many times she even searched the dry land above the island, but she never found it. (How it came to be at the shrine in the sand-dunes, out in the open and easily found, just in time for John and Alex to appear and lay claim to it, is perhaps a mystery that will forevermore go unsolved.) But since, by the command of the Goddess, even the Queen herself was unable to depart the bounds of her little island realm without perishing in fire, the fact that she never again found the amulet despite centuries of looking led Nephi to conclude that it truly was lost to her for all time. Taken back by Atargatis, perhaps, so that the Queen could never again be tempted to err, or tempt another mermaid into breaking their Goddess&#39;s most sacred taboo.<br />
<br />
So we can only imagine Queen Nephi&#39;s surprise when she swam into the lagoon on the present day. She expected to see mermaids lounging on the rocks and frolicking in the waters and, yes, cavorting together in futile imitation of human intercourse. It was no matter if the mermaids attempted to engage in such wanton acts of lewdness; in the eyes of the Goddess, their inability to experience the culmination of their lovemaking kept them virginal and pure. But this—what the Queen was seeing now—this was not virginal purity. This was the *opposite* of that. Mermaids—her precious, chaste, involuntarily celibate mermaids—were writhing together in a vast orgy of human breasts and fishy fins, moaning like harlots and—and—and—making each other *come*.<br />
<br />
Had she miscounted the days until the egg-time? Had the spring mating season perhaps arrived a little bit early? But, no, that would not explain this—this scandal. This effrontery. This sacrilege. Because even during their egg-time, mermaids never acted in such wanton and whorish fashion. Queen Nephi could barely bring herself to look at this ludicrous display.<br />
<br />
But look she did, and around one of the mermaid&#39;s necks—Impossible!—there she spied hanging the Queen&#39;s own sacred relic. The particular mermaid—the newcomer, the Queen recalled, the redhead called Alex—was squirming and gasping, writhing and wriggling, crying out in a state of total bliss. Two other mermaids were each suckling at one of Alex&#39;s breasts, and yet a third was stimulating her egg-hole, and she was riding a wave of body-rocking orgasms that crashed down one after another.  <br />
<br />
After Alex finished getting off—how many times had it been now? She didn&#39;t care, she&#39;d lost count, and that was *awesome*—she passed the amulet onto the next mermaid in line, Sally, who was definitely ready for her third go-around of the day.<br />
<br />
Only, that&#39;s when Nephi makes her presence known, and all of the mermaids stop what they&#39;re doing.<br />
<br />
Nephi swims forward, holds out her hand, and demands her amulet. The other mermaids are reluctant to obey their Queen; they do not want to give this thing up. She reminds them that their Goddess demands that they must be maidens and not women, for to be a mermaid and to be protected from the world of men, they must remain pure, and their carnal urges must remain buried and go unquenched. But the mermaids disagree; they want to be women again, and they say so, sometimes with strong words and make Nephi very angry. The black American girl from the 1930s has some particularly vulgar things to say, and the newcomer, Alex, protests loudly and angrily.<br />
<br />
And so Queen Nephi resorts to another gift of her Goddess, a different gift. Instead of implying her command, or stating it, she *sings* it.<br />
<br />
The Mermaid Queen sings, and the mermaids obey. They hover placidly in the water while Sally, though she tries to fight it, is compelled to remove the amulet. She passes the relic to Alex, who also pits her will against Nephi&#39;s song; but try as she might, she cannot win. She gives in and returns the sacred amulet to the Queen.<br />
<br />
At once, the Queen dons her holy symbol, and she feels a shudder of satisfaction pass through her body and gather in her loins. <br />
<br />
Her Goddess has forgiven her. Atargatis has returned to her high priestess her rightful reward and badge of office. And in three days&#39; time, when the spring mating-drive causes all the mermaids to lay their eggs in the sea—eggs which must, by the commandment of Atargatis, never become fertile and bear fruit by the action of a male—Nephi alone will feel the womanly joy of an orgasm, as her body expels its eggs and her two beloved handmaidens worship her breasts with their dexterous tongues.<br />
<br />
Confident that she has won the day, Queen Nephi departs the lagoon, taking Thetis and Miryam with her. All of the other mermaids are left there, angered and confused, wondering at the audacity of all that has just transpired.<br />
<br />
How dare the Queen take their newly-regained womanhood away from them again? How dare the Queen hoard such a thing to herself, and then with the same breath demand that others obey her Goddess while she herself is exempt?—the height, the very definition, of religious hypocrisy!<br />
<br />
Most of the mermaids there contemplate rebellion. Revolution. But they also feel fear: fear that any disobedience will be met with swift punishment, enforced by the power of the Queen&#39;s enchanted siren-song. With no way to resist that magic, the mermaids are already defeated before a rebellion can even begin.<br />
<br />
Alex, though, does not consider open rebellion. She stands apart from the other mermaids. She has an idea—and to see it through, she needs your help.</p>
