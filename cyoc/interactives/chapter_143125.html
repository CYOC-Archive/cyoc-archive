<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day for Harry and Jenny on the whole went rather well. Their classes went about the same as they always did and with some of the chaos that had been part of the issues that related to Jenny&#39;s unplanned entrance into were society and then the wedding to Harry sorted out, things also went quite smoothly, which was something that both could enjoy. The one thing that remained a major background issue though was the cleanup from the issues that had been there in the Harper family, though it appeared that the worst of that issue was past, and it would only be a matter of time before Janice and John would legally be in Harry and Jenny&#39;s custody and would be able to start school in Moon Lake. John would be at the High School and Janice would be at the Middle School.<br />
<br />
It was those things that floated through the back of Jenny&#39;s mind as she met up with Harry in the college common&#39;s building after their last class of the day. Partially as that would ultimately mean that she&#39;d need to meet with the High School and Middle School offices to fill out the paperwork for enrollment as Janice and John&#39;s legal guardian, but to a certain extent, Jenny actually looked forward to that. It&#39;d be test of her own abilities to look after someone and for the moment would be under conditions that she could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good afternoon?&quot; Harry asked to her as she got up from one of the couches and they hugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... things have been calm and quiet,&quot; Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you hear anything more from your brother?&quot; Harry asked as the two began to head out of the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... though, unless something &quot;big&quot; happened since he updated me earlier, I didn&#39;t really expect anything,&quot; Jenny commented, referring to the call she&#39;d taken earlier in the day. The nonsense that Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s lawyers had pulled to keep James Harper Senior silent on matters related Dieter&#39;s issues with the law wasn&#39;t good on many levels. For one thing, James Harper Senior probably wouldn&#39;t testify against Dieter Wilhelm, regardless of his health, which made the stunt unnecessary, and the other thing was that for the moment Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s trial hadn&#39;t gotten a shot to truly start, yet. So far as Jenny knew he was being held in Seattle to go before a Federal judge regarding the conspiracy charges and assassination orders that Dieter had ordered to secure possession of Jenny. Jenny was fairly certain that she and Harry, as well as Huck might ultimately be called in to testify in that trial once the Feds got themselves sorted out, but for the moment hadn&#39;t arrived, yet.<br />
<br />
Harry only nodded as they walked along. He dutifully opened the doors that let them walk out into the sunshine and then making their way to the right along a sidewalk that would take them to where he&#39;d parked his car earlier in the day. He offered his arm to Jenny and she happily took it as they walked along. From there, it didn&#39;t take too long to reach Harry&#39;s car and make their way back to the Jenkins home. They arrived to hear some commotion going on in the house as they walked through the garage and through a door that took them into the laundry room with an open doorway that lead to the kitchen to their left as they came in. However, the commotion was rather friendly as Janice was explaining some things to Henry that Lisa had been teaching her and John was on the couch watching something on Animal Planet on the television while holding a small chess set in his lap. That commotion soon turned to a chorus of hellos as Harry and Jenny made their way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you two,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;Have a good day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at what Lisa&#39;s been teaching me!&quot; Janice declared as she approached and holding up the practice piece that Lisa Jenkins had set aside for Janice to practice with.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been a hobby for me,&quot; Lisa explained as Jenny gave a soft glance to Lisa. &quot;There is nothing necessarily wrong with being a wife and home maker. The thing that&#39;s been irritating for me is that some people seem to get the idea that that is the only thing. If a woman wants go out and be a leader, that is her choice, and there is nothing wrong with that, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem,&quot; Jenny assured Lisa, &quot;You and Henry have been so kind to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s the right thing to do,&quot; Henry commented as Jenny gave Lisa a small hug. He though gave a small look to Harry, who hung back for a moment. He guessed that something was going on as neither Harry nor Jenny answered his initial question, even though he could probably also add Janice&#39;s interjection of what Lisa had been teaching her as part of the reason for that. &quot;Is anything going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Jenny did get a call from her brother around lunchtime,&quot; Harry began.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up with Jim?&quot; John asked from the couch and looking up as he used the nickname that the family had often had for James Harper Junior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there&#39;s been good news and bad news,&quot; Jenny spoke with a sigh and moved to stand beside Harry, taking comfort and confidence with him being there, &quot;the good news is that all the paperwork regarding transferring John and Janice to mine and Harry&#39;s custody has gone through and the we can start the process of transferring them into the Moon Lake district... though, it&#39;s likely that they won&#39;t get the chance to start school here until December... Jim will have to contact their schools to start the transfer process, return their textbooks to their appropriate teachers and handle any fines they might have...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And given where we are in the year... and given the time that John and Janice here have likely missed already, Washington State may want them to take some placement exam in case some of the courses they&#39;ve taken in Alabama don&#39;t count for our state&#39;s credits,&quot; Harry added.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all bureaucratic stuff,&quot; Henry gave a shrug, &quot;that shouldn&#39;t be too hard... and if things do line up with regard to their credits, they might be able to start before Thanksgiving break.&quot;<br />
<br />
John blinked for a moment, as part of his mind almost immediately seemed to drift to thoughts of Ginger and him in classes together and being able to have fun as friends together. That was good news, and he could also see that Janice was also excited about that as she was soon hopping up and down between Lisa and Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... but a lot of that will depend on how quickly Jim can get the transfer papers worked out with the schools down there,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and that will be complicated by what the bad news is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad news?&quot; Janice asked, her voice a bit nervous and losing its excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That relates more to dad&#39;s health and Dieter&#39;s trial,&quot; Jenny gave a sigh, &quot;Dad&#39;s insurance wanted to buy time to see if his heart was really as weak as Doctor Tachibana said it was... but in the end, the cardiologists in Alabama found that Dad was in no medical condition to wait that long after another heart attack when he and mom had some measure of dispute over his will... In this, the insurance had to accept it as an emergency measure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good...&quot; Henry said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but at the same time, Dieter Wilhelm is apparently set to fight the charges against him and through his lawyers has pulled an end around,&quot; Harry answered wrapping one arm around Jenny&#39;s shoulders, &quot;and while the trial hasn&#39;t gotten started yet... beyond maybe getting Wilhelm&#39;s plea, his end around made the claim that any sort of &quot;cooperation&quot; with law enforcement against Wilhelm broke certain agreements that James Harper Senior had made, which in a sense allowed for him to be suspended without access to his benefits...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means that things will be tougher on mom and James Junior,&quot; Jenny sighed, &quot;which will in turn slow things down while he tries to either catch up or sort through things at the college he&#39;s been going to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But doesn&#39;t your father work as a lineman?&quot; Lisa asked, &quot;maintaining the power lines and repairing those that get broken? That&#39;s not something that would require a contract or agreement made before employment...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but the problematic thing is that our folks really don&#39;t have the funds for it,&quot; Jenny looked down for a moment, &quot;they could win any legal battle that the insurance company would have to cover the costs listed under their plan and that cooperation with law enforcement is not something that one can be fired for... but at the same time, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;d be able then afford the legal fees. It&#39;s not something that can just be won... not easily anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed and then slowly nodded, &quot;You&#39;ll just have to take the good news and work with what you can effect and remain optimistic that things you can&#39;t effect will turn out well... sometimes that&#39;s about all anyone can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny did nod in response to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... I would wonder... have you heard anything from the prosecutors on the trial and the dates they want for it?&quot; Lisa wondered, &quot;given that Harry was the intended target and Huck was the one who was shot... but we really haven&#39;t heard much with regards to scheduling and all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They might think that Huck is still in the hospital,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;recovering from the wound, given  that he required surgery to repair damage to his lung and get in inflated back to normal size... and even with lycanthropic regeneration, he was in serious condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but we&#39;ve called Huck off and on when he hasn&#39;t been here, they haven&#39;t called his cellphone or Jenkins Construction to try and schedule him as a witness in any capacity... or even ask,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;One would think they&#39;d at least try some of that so that the trial could proceed in an effective manner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they&#39;re overwhelmed with other cases,&quot; John offered which turned some heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had some left over newspapers that came from Seattle,&quot; John answered, &quot;some mess with a rat tail from the arrest of some gang down on their docks seemed to be one of the lead stories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be possible,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;though... I thought that guy was ultimately killed in a Seattle hospital... But, I suppose that&#39;s possible.&quot;</p>
