<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samuel woke up in his cell.  He sat up on the bed he had been laying on.  He was now wearing gray sweatpants and a gray t-shirt.  Across from him, Keith was also waking up on a different bed.  Samuel quickly shook the effects of the drugs remembering what the warden had told him, he hoped to his feet and pulled his sweats forward looking down at his penis.  Keith did the same, apparently he had been the recipient of a similar conversation.  &quot;Excuse me ma&#39;am, they&#39;re awake&quot; came a male voice from a speaker on the wall near the glass door, &quot;ohh good&quot; a female voice responded, &quot;a limited test, we don&#39;t want to delay their healing.&quot;  Samuel and Keith looked at the guard and scientist who were standing outside the cell looking in.  The guard raised his arm and pointed a small remote at Keith, &quot;testing subject beta now.&quot; Keith screamed and fell to his knees as Samuel looked on in horror. &quot;Testing subject alpha&quot; came next and Samuel felt the worst pain he&#39;d ever felt in his life.  The shock started in his balls and moved outwards, besides being able to let out a scream Samuel was completely incapacitated for a second before it abated.  &quot;Very good&quot; the scientist said matter a factly, &quot;gentleman from this point on you won&#39;t be drugged or shackled, however, if you step out of line you will be subdued. For your reference that was the lowest setting.  Additionally, if you attempt to remove your implant it will explode upon contact with the air and in that small enclosed room it will more than likely kill you both, so police yourselves.&quot;  Samuel and Keith looked at each other as they struggled to get back on their feet.  Before turning to leave the scientist offered, &quot;we&#39;ll begin psychological profiling and neurological mapping after lunch. In the mean time, get to know each other&quot; then she reached towards the wall and the intercom turned off.  She left to the left heading away down the hallway.    <br />
<br />
Samuel was left alone with Keith. Across the way he could see Lee and Matt also recovering, he assumed Maria was in a similar situation.   Keith spoke first, &quot;Did he show you your ball in a jar?&quot; Samuel nodded before standing up.  Between the glass door, the roommate, and the toilet mounted to the wall in the room without any partition there was no privacy so Samuel pulled down his sweatpants and underwear exposing his cock.  He gently grabbed his scrotum and examined it gingerly.  There where it connected to his body were a few small stitches.  He rolled his balls around in his hands, one of them was same as it always had been, the other was hard and artificial.  They&#39;d really taken his left nut.  If Samuel had any weakness in him, he may have cried.<br />
<br />
Samuel looked over at Keith as he pulled up his pants. Keith had his sweats and underwear pulled down like Samuel had, exposing his round sculpted ass.  Samuel was straight, but he also thought of himself as an alpha male, and a hole is a hole when you want to get off.  Sex isn&#39;t something Samuel asked for, it was something that was due to him because of his strength, his physique, his good looks. So more often than not Samuel just took it, regardless of what the other person said.  A memory fluttered into Samuel&#39;s mind. He thought of the time the leader of the Brooklyn Warriors, his gang&#39;s rivals, found Samuel&#39;s mother.  She was a heroine junkie who had put Samuel on the streets when he was eight, just over eight years ago.  Carlos, the Warrior&#39;s head, traded her a small fix of heroin to let him film them fucking and sent a copy over to Samuel.  He thought this would insult Samuel; he thought this would it would drive him over the edge. Samuel watched with cool detachment as his rivals average sized cock slid in and out of the woman who&#39;d given birth to him and listened as he was taunted.  The truth was while Samuel couldn&#39;t have cared less for the woman who&#39;d abandon him so early in life, but he couldn&#39;t let the intentioned insult go unanswered and Samuel knew something Carlos didn&#39;t.  So Samuel went out and picked up Carlos&#39;s twin brother at the gay bar he usually frequented and then sent a video of his own.  Everyone in the Warriors got a copy of someone who looked identical to Carlos on his back taking 10&quot; of Samuel&#39;s hard, bare cock and loving it. They listened as he moaned with pleasure and called Samuel &#39;daddy.&#39;  The brother was never seen again after that, and the street war between the Paynes and the Warriors was on.  This made Samuel&#39;s dick twitch, but whatever anesthetic they&#39;d given him kept it from growing to full mast.  Samuel looked up from Keith&#39;s ass, up his back to his head, thinking of the fun he&#39;d eventually have, when he noticed it.  There on the back of Keith&#39;s neck was what looked like a USB port.  Samuel quickly reached to touch his own neck, he had one too.  <br />
<br />
Samuel rushed over to Keith placing his hand on the addition to Keith&#39;s neck.  Keith panicked and yelled, &quot;Don&#39;t fucking touch me!&quot; while trying in vane to get away. His pants were still down so his attempt to push Samuel away and run left him on the floor.  Samuel took just a moment to size Keith up. He was significantly shorter than Samuel&#39;s 6&#39; 1&quot;, probably mid five feet, short brown hair and brown eyes, probably around 16, he lacked muscle definition in his arms and legs probably his torso as well, he had a nice ass that Samuel had noticed earlier, and between his legs was a skinny, short penis and two little balls, much smaller than Samuels, smaller than any Samuel had ever seen.  Samuel smirked, definite beta bitch material.  Samuel wiped the smirk from his face and looked down at Keith sternly as Keith struggled but eventually got his pants up.  &quot;You have something on your neck, I&#39;ve got one too,&quot; Samuel bellowed as Keith stood up.  Keith reached back and felt the piece of hardware implanted in him.  &quot;Turn around so I can see what it is,&quot; Samuel commanded firmly, &quot;and then I&#39;ll show you mine.&quot;  Keith thought for a second before complying. As Samuel looked at the two different size slots that had been grafted into Keith, Keith spoke, &quot;I thought you were attacking me.&quot;  Samuel stepped away from Keith who turned to face him,  &quot;if I was attacking you I wouldn&#39;t have stopped when your ass hit the floor&quot; Samuel stated matter of factly.  The two boys stared at each other Samuel knew this game well, they were testing each others dominance, whoever broke eye contact first would be starting from a weaker position next time things came to a head.  Samuel had never blinked first, and he wasn&#39;t going to start now.  A second later, Keith averted his gaze and looked down at the floor. Thats right, good bitch, Samuel thought to himself letting his gaze bore into Keith for a moment before turning to sit on the bed.  Keith took his turn to examine Samuel&#39;s neck,  &quot;Its a USB port with a micro USB port next to it, maybe input and output&quot; Keith reasoned aloud, &quot;I can&#39;t tell anything else from it, these things are used for everything for, well, everything. Downloads, uploads, power transfers.&quot;  Samuel thought for a second, he didn&#39;t know what any of that meant, but Keith seemed to have some ideas and now Keith belonged to Samuel.  &quot;Push me again,&quot; Samuel spoke calmly, &quot;and I&#39;ll rip that little worm you call a cock off and feed it to you.&quot;  Fear flashed across Keith&#39;s face, Samuel was a little surprised then when Keith retorted, &quot;Then the bomb would go off and we&#39;d both die, not a big thinker are you.&quot;  Just then the door opened and two guards placed trays of food in the room.</p>
