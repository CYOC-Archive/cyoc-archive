<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean allowed himself to stare into his reflection for a good couple of minutes, trying to convince himself that the reflection was his own.  He knew it was his own.  But all he saw was a skunk&#39;s anus.  That was something he never wanted to look at, and now that&#39;s exactly what he was.  Finally, he decided that just because he was an anus didn&#39;t mean he had to look at one.  <i>Okay, I&#39;m done.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot;  Sean was pulled away from the mirror, as the skunktaur waddled out of the the bathroom.  &quot;Do you know how you want to use the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What?  Oh.  No, I&#39;ve got nothing.</i>  The truth was that Sean wasn&#39;t interested in another transformation, yet.  After all, he had just used the Chronivac to become a skunktaur&#39;s anus.  Not that she was aware of that.  Heck, she didn&#39;t even exist until five minutes ago.  But as far as she was aware, Sean had been her anus her entire life.  And yet he knew nothing about her, outside of her species.  He didn&#39;t even know her name.  Was there a way to find out, without revealing the truth?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is the Chronivac asking about saving changes?  We didn&#39;t do anything, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drat, he had forgotten about that!  The Chronivac&#39;s changes stay onscreen until you either save them or undo them.  Thankfully, the windows showing his current form and the transformation should be identical, so she&#39;ll have no idea what transformation just took place.  Wait, maybe he could use this to his advantage!  Just need the perfect lie.  <i>Do you remember how you fell asleep a bit ago?  I bet it happened because you triggered a transformation.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t use it, though.  I wouldn&#39;t use it without your permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Oh, um, but I did ask you.  I asked you to look through its options.  You must&#39;ve triggered something by accident.  We should check if everything&#39;s the same.  What&#39;s your name?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m your body, I don&#39;t have a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What?  But what do I call you?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t call me anything.  You just tell me what to do.  What an odd question.&quot;<br />
<br />
This came as a complete surprise to Sean.  How can they go around without her being called at least something?  And she&#39;s so casual about it, too!  On the bright side, the fact that she considers herself wholly his body is a good sign.  The idea of a skunktaur being subservient to her own anus (him) was too funny an idea to pass up.  But the no-name thing?  That needs to change.  <i>I was thinking, I want to call you something.  Like how some guys nickname their dicks.  From now on, your name is... Butt.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?  Thank you!&quot;  Sean&#39;s world bopped up and down a bit in excitement.  She actually likes the name!  Now this is funny, AND adorable!<br />
<br />
<i>Okay, Butt.  Now take a picture of yourself.  I want to see what you look like.  You know, to make sure you look the same.</i>  Butt may be subservient, but he still wanted to make sure he had a logical reason for his questions, so she didn&#39;t suspect anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Sean was brought across the room, and then everything stopped while the skunktaur took her picture.  Then, the world flipped around as she curled up on the floor, holding Sean&#39;s now-giant phone in front of him with claw-tipped fingers.  The first thing he noticed was the black-furred pair of breasts, average-sized for her frame and with nipples that barely poked out of her fur.  Surrounding them was a sea of black fur that covered almost her entire body, save for long white hair, a white stripe on her forehead, and of course the trademark white stripes running down her lower back (and presumably her upper back).  Beneath her fur was hints of toned muscle, much like Sean had given himself earlier.  Her eyes were brown, and notably human-looking.  He himself used to have blue eyes, so this was an interesting difference.<br />
<br />
His attention went back to the breasts.  Sean was a bit of a closet furry, so he definitely saw their appeal.  He then decided to test his ownership of her.  <i>I have nice breasts.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, I&#39;m glad you like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the breasts were indeed considered his.  A shame he can&#39;t fondle them.  Come to think of it, the vagina directly below him was technically his, too.  His own vagina, and he couldn&#39;t even feel it.  Not when his sense of self was contained entirely within her anus.  He briefly considered using the Chronivac to extend his sense of self to the skunktaur&#39;s body.  But no, the entire point of this experiment was to find out if he was still considered a person despite solely being an anus.<br />
<br />
<i>Alright, I&#39;m done.  Everything looks the same.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Sean&#39;s phone was pulled away, and his world was reorientated as Butt got back on her feet.  &quot;But I wonder what changes the Chronivac wants to save.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Huh?  Oh, right!  Hey, I remember what we changed!  Remember how you fell asleep?  I had you make yourself sleepy so you could have a power nap and we could stay up later.</i>  Sean had no idea whether such an option existed, but it was the first thing he could come up with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay.  I wonder why I don&#39;t remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>You make a good point.  Let&#39;s never use that option, again.  In fact, pretend it doesn&#39;t exist.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Pretend what doesn&#39;t exist?&quot;  There was a coy tone in her question.  Sean wasn&#39;t sure where her playfulness came from, but at least now he won&#39;t have to worry about anybody looking for an option that may not exist.  &quot;If there weren&#39;t any changes, what should I tell the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean thought for a moment.  Saving the changes would overwrite his human form.  This was intended to be a temporary experiment, so he had no intention of staying this way.  At the same time, he didn&#39;t want to undo the transformation until after his roommates saw him.  <i>Just leave it alone, for now.  Hey by the way, what time is it?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;9:16.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still well over two hours before his roommates were likely to return from the party.  This was a school night, but they&#39;d stay up partying &#39;til midnight if they thought they could get away with it.  Still, that&#39;s a long wait to be an anus.  He still wasn&#39;t used to how his scrunched up body felt, not having the ability to move or even breathe.  How does a man-turned-anus pass the time?</p>
