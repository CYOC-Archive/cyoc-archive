<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So...&quot; Troy looked at the German Shepard laying down on the rug in his living room. &quot;I have a dog now... Hopefully Dustin doesn&#39;t get jealous...&quot; He thought about it a bit more. Then looked at the content dog laying in the middle of the room. &quot;You&#39;re not Dustin, right?&quot; The dog looked at him and tilted his head. &quot;Nah...&quot; Troy finally managed. He looked at his phone to see the 20+ messages from Dustin.<br />
<br />
Each one was asking if he was awake yet or if he could come over. &quot;Not in the mood,&quot; Troy put his phone on the coffee table and went back to the book. There were a bunch of new spells. But several of them seemed pretty similar. It was obvious that Mark was just trying to make his own DnD world, it just didn&#39;t make sense in how he was doing it. By changing everyone around him, it would only make him as a human stand out more. Though, looking outside and seeing Clint mow his lawn, Troy couldn&#39;t help but feel the same. The massively buff horse wearing some short jean shorts and a white sleeveless shirt would have been completely out of the ordinary. Now, even as people walked down the street, no one batted an eye. Except maybe to ogle his sweat drenched muscles the were currently being clung to by his clothes.<br />
<br />
Troy peeled his eyes away and went back to the book. It seemed to only be summon and transform spells. They were similar to his, focusing more on characters from stories rather than animals. Also, without the group transformation abilities. Though, Troy wasn&#39;t 100% sure how to use those either. It seemed as though those would be more for causing a diversion, but until he was in a real situation, he wouldn&#39;t know. Afterall, he had been forced into becoming a Canidae animal as well so the only reason he could do it was as a distraction.<br />
<br />
He looked back down at the dog. &quot;So are you mine now?&quot;<br />
<br />
One bark.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re back to that now...&quot; Troy muttered. It wasn&#39;t like he didn&#39;t want a dog. Having something else around to keep him company would be nice. His house may not have been big, but that didn&#39;t mean it couldn&#39;t get lonely. He zoned out for a second thinking about everything he&#39;d need; food, bowels for water and food, a collar, a leash, bags to pick up the poop. Then shook his head. Later. I&#39;ll get those later. Right now it was the book. He looked at it again thinking about the spells, finally choosing one of the summons.<br />
<br />
Though, he wasn&#39;t positive what he really could summon. The book listed a few options, but other questions still remained. How strong would something like a genie be? And under which historical context? Could he specify? Would it be 1001 Arabian Nights or Disney? If it were Disney, could he just get around the whole 3 wishes thing by summoning it over and over again? Or, did that qualify as one of the more powerful ones and he wouldn&#39;t be able to control it? And how much control did he actually have? Would it be implied or did he actually have to issue commands? Or was it based around his own desires? Or if he summoned something too strong, would he then be under its whims?<br />
<br />
&quot;Start with something simple stupid,&quot; Troy threw himself onto the couch and held a pillow against his face. All those questions might be answered later, but probably not by him. He just wanted to have a little bit of fun. And thinking back to his little fight with Mark, he knew what he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monster,&quot; he commanded, thinking about a leonin. In a puff of smoke a massive leonin paladin stood on the other side of the room. He must have been nearly 7 feet tall, covered in plated armor. His sword rested in its scabbard and his shield along his arm. Each piece of equipment looked heavier than anything Troy could possibly pick up let alone use. Even just standing there, the leonin commanded an impressive amount of power and charisma. Rosco trained his eyes on the massive beast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings master,&quot; he answered. &quot;How may I be of service to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
A happy squeal built up inside of Troy as he gripped a couch pillow for support. &quot;Are you...&quot; he tried to think of how to phrase it but just blurted it out. &quot;Are you really a leonin?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master,&quot; not a hint of irony or anger in his voice over the stupidity of the question. &quot;My name is Lancer. I hail from a far off kingdom of Gurudia and was raised to be a powerful fighter to protect my kingdom from evil religions that come to corrupt her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! So, you actually exist?&quot; Troy leaned forward more squeezing his pillow more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m unsure about the question,&quot; Lancer answered. &quot;But yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy let out another squeal. &quot;This is so crazy!&quot; he screamed into his pillow. &quot;So! If I ask you to do something, do you have to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m unsure of the question,&quot; Lancer said again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to do what I say? So if I say, &#39;jump,&#39;&quot; Lancer jumped. The whole room shook and Rosco looked up with a growl. Troy pet his dog. &quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s alright,&quot; he said calming him down. &quot;Pull out your sword,&quot; Lancer did as he was told. &quot;Woah...&quot; Even Lancer seemed a bit concerned over the lack of control he had. Troy waited a few seconds before finally saying, &quot;Kill your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Lancer pointed his sword towards Troy. His eyes turned grim. Narrowing to near slits as his maw snarled at his &#39;master.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. Good. I&#39;m glad you won&#39;t do that,&quot; Troy said. Lancer withdrew his sword, but his sour face remained. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just wanted to see how much control I had. If you started running off I would have given you a different command. Though... I guess your family is in an alternate dimension so... I don&#39;t really know how that would have worked exactly... Shit... Sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer seemed to calm down a bit, though his attitude was still a bit stiff. &quot;Why have you summoned me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I needed to test something. I figured this would be the best way to test it. Afterall, I doubt you would have liked being summoned during a battle,&quot; Troy answered. &quot;Though, how we fight probably isn&#39;t in the way you fight. See, I got this book that has a ton of spells in it and have to find. 5? No, it&#39;s 6 more to find. And one of the spells is summon. So I summoned you,&quot; He paused and the silence became palpable. &quot;In a noncombat situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot; Lancer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Not you specifically. Just a Leonin. And cause I think they&#39;re kind of hot,&quot; Troy answered honestly. &quot;And it seems like you&#39;re no exception.&quot; For a moment Lancer broke eye contact. His eyes drifted off and if he didn&#39;t have so much fur, Troy could have sworn his face would have burned bright red. He scratched the side of his face with one of his claws. &quot;What? Would you prefer me to look more like a lion? I can,&quot; Troy said. He pulled the blinds to his windows closed. Kicked off his shoes. Stripped the rest of his clothes and said, &quot;Half.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lancer stared at his nude body intently as golden fur erupted from his skin. It instantly started to cover every part of his bare body, spreading across his arms and down his legs. Everywhere it touched only seemed to grow. Quickly doubling, then tripling its original size. His arms started to thicken and shoulders widen. Claws grew out of his fingertips and toes. He went to his tiptoes and the balls of his feet only seemed to grow longer, giving him a more digitigrade stature. Every part of his bone structure in his hands and feet shifted to accommodate his new weight. Little paw pads grew under his hands and feet. <br />
<br />
Troy&#39;s face stretched and molded into a lion&#39;s maw, with thick pointed teeth at least double the size they had been. Troy stood a few inches taller than he had but his mane was a much softer yellow compared to Lancer&#39;s dark brown one. &quot;See? Better?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so master,&quot; Lancer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I say so..? What? What does that even mean? Is it because I&#39;m naked?&quot; Troy looked down at his erect lion penis. &quot;Is it because of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer looked away. &quot;No master.&quot; His eyes refused to really look or focus on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then what?&quot; Troy demanded. Lancer only seemed to tighten his lips even further. &quot;Tell me.&quot; It looked like he was giving in. &quot;Tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ipreferyouinyourhumanform,&quot; Lancer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Troy&#39;s mouth hung open a bit. Why would the lion man not want to be around another lion man? &quot;Is it because of the clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Lancer answered. Now Troy could almost see the red. Even though that thick fur, Lancer&#39;s embarrassment was becoming impossible to deny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you--&quot; Troy cut a smile. He let out a laugh. &quot;Do you have a human fetish!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with it!&quot; Lancer stomped his foot.<br />
<br />
Seeing a chunk of his floor scrape off, Troy was quick to try to calm him down. &quot;No! There&#39;s nothing wrong with it,&quot; he said. &quot;Shape.&quot; Instantly all that lionness about Troy disappeared and all that was left was his human form, completely in the nude. All 5 inches of his dick were as hard as a rock. Now Lancer was having a real hard time looking at him. Though, that didn&#39;t keep him from peeking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master, please put some clothes on,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Troy just laughed at the idea as he sauntered closer to the massive lion. &quot;Absolutely not. You can have a human fetish. But what if I have a giant sexy lion man fetish? Hmm?&quot; One of Troy&#39;s fingers traced the grooves of armor, focusing on the chest, then lowering to his legs. <br />
<br />
Lancer let out a squeak. The big man and all his confidence somehow looked absolutely defenseless. &quot;Nonsense. Not with an ugly Leonin like me.&quot; He squirmed under the lack of personal space Troy was giving him. Watching the small human eye him so greedily was so unusual. Yet stimulating. His armor was getting uncomfortably hot. He&#39;d been in hundreds of battles, but it had never felt so claustrophobic. He was having trouble breathing. Thinking. All his thoughts were just focused on this naked human touching his armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now who&#39;s speaking nonsense,&quot; Troy mocked. &quot;Take off your armor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But--&quot; Lancer tried to protest but his hands were already doing the job for him. Unstrapping straps. Unhooking latches. Shaking off the gloves. Setting down his sword and shield. Then stepping out of his legs. And there he stood, nearly in the nude. Only a bit of loincloth to cover and protect his privates and a few leather straps to help make the armor chaff less. <br />
<br />
&quot;So big......&quot; Troy admired. His eyes trailed every inch of the massive Leonin. Built like an offseason bodybuilder, each one of his muscles were big and round. His chest ballooned well out in front of him while he had the inkling of abs covered up by a good healthy diet. His legs looked thicker than tree trunks, brimming with massive, corded muscles. Quads where each of the muscle groups could be easily seen and calves that were shaped like diamonds. &quot;So big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer&#39;s dick bounced with joy at the complement. It also didn&#39;t help that it was done by such a cute human. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he muttered quietly. Then was shocked when he felt Troy&#39;s body press up against his. The warm hands running across his pecs and over his arms. He naturally flexed the massive bicep. It bulged almost lifting the small human off the ground. But that only seemed to excite Troy more. He squeezed and squeezed with all his might but couldn&#39;t do anything about it. Giggling the entire time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Top or bottom?&quot; Troy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha--?&quot; Lancer was about to ask but he already felt Troy grab his finger and pull him into the bedroom. Despite being less than half his size, Troy pushed Lancer down onto the bed. &quot;What are--?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You took too long,&quot; Troy answered. He climbed between the lionman&#39;s legs and opened his mouth wide. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mas--!&quot; Lancer cried out. Somehow Troy fit his 8 inch dick into his mouth. Lancer&#39;s hand reached out to push Troy off, but ended up gripping the back of his head. &quot;Ooooooo...&quot; he moaned. His claws extended and retracted with each generous suck. He felt his hips buck ever so slightly as his tail tried to swoosh beneath him. It hung limply off the bed, just twitching with each additional suck. Just feeling that tongue wrap around and lick his dick was enough, but actually feeling the human&#39;s mouth run up and down it was even better. But then Troy stopped, forcing Lancer to remain on edge. &quot;What&#39;s wrong Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Troy,&quot; Troy commanded. He jumped further up onto the lion and shoved his ass onto the hard cock. Lancer&#39;s claws dug deep into the mattress as he did anything to avoid cumming. Feeling his dick slide deeper and deeper into the human was more than he expected. His body couldn&#39;t control itself. Muscles flexed and relaxed on their own. His hips bucked. Toes curled. And a deep grunt exited his mouth as Troy used his asshole to please him.<br />
<br />
Lancer was rapidly losing himself in the ecstasy. His body thrust again. And then he felt a cool feeling splash onto his fur. That was too much. His body bucked and he felt himself let out a powerful roar. Over and over his body thrust into the small human on top of him. Until he finally was brought back down from his high. &quot;Mas--Troy!&quot; he corrected himself. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy&#39;s fingers grasped Lancer&#39;s fur. &quot;I think so...&quot; a dumb grin filled his face. &quot;Didn&#39;t know you had all that in you...&quot; He seemed to find it a perfect resting place on his pillowy pecs, slowly rotating his index finger around Lancer&#39;s nipple. Then slowly drifting off to sleep. Lancer laid there a strange mix of happiness running through him as the tiny human rested on him.</p>
