<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian felt her pubic area and belted out a cute little scream in Vicki’s sexy voice! “How… What….Oh”! Then she fainted.<br />
<br />
Dan now in Brian's body picked up Vicki’s body gracefully and put it gently on the bed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Vicki had been thinking, Dan was so right saying that they hadn’t had a long enough engagement. &quot;I want nothing more to do with that putz&quot;, she told herself.<br />
<br />
Then the phone rang again and Brian's voice came through the line, &quot;Hello Vicki&quot;, said Brian's voice. Vicki could tell it had to be Dan.<br />
<br />
“Vicki – it’s me Dan. I’m in Brian’s body”. Come now, and when you do I'll be back in your body and Brian will be back in his body.<br />
<br />
I love you darling, and I always have. I regret not telling you that I’m head-over-heels in love with you, and I’m more than ready to marry you and spend my life with you as your wife or husband&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please come over and put things right&quot;. &quot;You'll find the ring, next to the rope I once used to tie you to the bed&quot;. &quot;Use it to switch things for the better&quot;. &quot;Keep this in mind darling, I adore you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Vicki replied &quot;but Dan - what do you want me to do&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dan said, &quot;I'll leave that to you&quot; honey. &quot;You'll know what to do, and I'm ready for anything you do&quot;. I know now that I love you and want to be with you - if you'll have me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, see you soon&quot;, said Vicki. <br />
<br />
Wow – Vicki thought to herself. He felt warm and gushy but in this body that came with the desire to poke, so it sure felt different.<br />
<br />
He also felt a little bit ashamed and realized that he was the biggest part of the problem when he was Vicki, because she had never really given herself completely to Dan. Now he felt like doing that big time. Also previously Dan was never that direct with his feelings. &quot;Being female probably helped him find and balance himself&quot;, he thought.<br />
<br />
Vicki drove back to the house her body usually lived in, and as he entered, he heard Brian muttering, “just a figment of my imagination”.<br />
<br />
Then he heard from Brian, “So why did you tell me that you were having your period? Were you holding out for Dan? I know you're still carrying a torch for him!<br />
<br />
At hearing this in the hallway, Vicki thought to himself, “no fool, I was duped by you and thought you were the man of my dreams”. “Little did I know then that the man of my dreams was also my friend, and is about to be my lover again – but I have a surprise for you”! He burst into the room, and Brian lunged at him. Thinking quickly Vicki pulled the ring from the underwear drawer where the rope was kept, and put it on his finger.<br />
<br />
Brian's attack led to a strange effect. Suddenly Brian as the attacker became the attacked. Vicki got up from Dan's body and in one quick swift movement removed the ring from Dan's body and rose to admire her naked male body in the mirror. It was pleasing to see Brian's long penis hanging where she was used to having a vagina.<br />
<br />
Brian was completely disoriented now, and unable to cope, with the enormity of what had apparently happened, he crawled downstairs; got in his car (Brian's) and drove off.<br />
<br />
Vicki took a deep breath sighing relief that Brian had left.<br />
<br />
“Wow”, said Vicki to himself, “what a rush”. I feel turgid and invincible and this dick is ready for action. What a tantalizing opportunity.<br />
<br />
Vicki deposited the ring in his pocket, grabbed the rope from the drawer, hugged Dan and then with a sly loving smile, started to tie Dan to the bed.<br />
<br />
This feeling of omnipotence he had was intoxicating and so enjoyable. Dan was anxious to be taken and watched longingly as her lover first tied her arms and feet to the four posters on the bed, leaving her spread eagle and vulnerable.<br />
<br />
Now Vicki grabbed Dan's beautiful ass and inserted his long schlong slowly and just they way he remembered wanting it from the other perspective. He started making love to her. Oh my God, was all Dan could utter at first and then she felt more and more of an explosive orgasm building, and being completely passive and unable to resist made it all the more provocative an experience.<br />
<br />
Vicki was kissing, and licking Dan in the most intimate places he new would drive her wild, from head to toe. Soon he was sucking her tits and fingering her vagina in a manner only he knew exactly while his penis was growing and sliding titillating within her.<br />
<br />
Dan screamed in erotic ecstasy. What ecstasy it was to be passive and, bound to the bed, she thought as she squealed rapturously delighted from the electrifying rush of Vicki’s love pulsing and throbbing within her.<br />
<br />
She now knew the incredible joy of being a woman and really didn’t care if she was ever a man again.<br />
<br />
If it weren't for the lives we have to live in the world outside the bedroom, I want to be female forever since nothing could be as wonderful as this feeling of being passive and sought by the man she loves. Dan was ready to be Vicki forever, and if Vicki wants that too we'll just figure out a way to change our lives and make this work.<br />
<br />
She wanted to do everything for him; to make him feel like master of the home; and to treat him like a king, since Dan knew very well how men want to be treated, and even better he knew now that the payoff in life is all in the giving.<br />
<br />
Certainly Vicki seemed to know exactly how to treat her like a queen, and the love she was feeling from him was extraordinary.<br />
<br />
Dan, knew she was ready to give all of herself, for the rest of her life to her soul mate Vicki now in Brian's body. She felt pangs of desire to be made pregnant by Vicki and to give him babies to nurture with the all encompassing love she felt now for him.<br />
<br />
Vicki as it turns out - also was thrilled to be in Brian’s body. It was supple and strong and had a very long schlong, which she used over and over again to drive Dan into explosive screaming ecstatic joy beyond joy –with orgasms repeating again and again – uncontrollably such that Dan was twisting with delight.<br />
<br />
As Brian was driving out of town, he started to get a glimmer of understanding that somehow this was a form of punishment to fit his crime of haughtiness.<br />
<br />
The experience changed him, and now without the plentitude of surging male hormones he had before, he was able to think a bit more rationally and decided he had best give up his sense of power and that it was time to take stock and make the best of what he had, so he drove on to Idaho where no one knew him and he could start fresh.<br />
<br />
He took odd jobs and eventually earned enough to start a farm, and at the same time married a pretty little farm girl named Cindy, who he properly wooed and treated respectfully. They loved together and made 4 precious youngsters.<br />
