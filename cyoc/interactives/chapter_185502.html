<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The woods were relatively dark and quiet as you and Luna entered them, though in many ways this had been something that came about over time. Once the world knew about werewolves in a way that wasn&#39;t being guided by religion or some mysticism, they often became part of national cultures and how societies functioned, and it actually lead a sort of victory for various environmentalist type arguments. Things like industrialization wasn&#39;t stopped, but the wholesale deforestation of much of the world wasn&#39;t done to the degree it had been done before werewolves were discovered. Often because, while werewolves weren&#39;t necessarily psychopathic killers, they were still predators and hunting deer or wild boar was something they liked and this often lead to areas where natural forests existed being protected to protect that sort of balance in nature. Even major cities supposedly had measures that were their parks were more wild than what one would expect.<br />
<br />
This had meant that your home town had a lot of old growth forest around its edges, with much of it being oak trees with relatively thick undergrowth that included a heavy bed of leaves, that this time of year could often be wet after periods of rain. They crinkled a little as you and Luna walked across them with little trouble as your paw pads were thick enough to avoid being cut on rocks or anything that might be underneath those leaves. It was a perfect environment for deer, wolves, werewolves, and MILF-wolves. Deer came to eat the plants and predators soon followed. At times it lead to some frustration and even hunting of mundane predators. Even werewolves often hunted predators as a means of competition for the prey species they liked or preferred. It wasn&#39;t until the twentieth century when the environmentalist movement got stronger politically in the need protect wild predators. It also lead to a great many farmers actually raising White Tail Deer and Mule Deer in the US as livestock to provide food for werewolves that wouldn&#39;t compete with mundane predators or the normal hunting season. Classes in High School and rumors also indicated that MILF-wolves could also enjoy hunting.<br />
<br />
But for the moment, neither you nor Luna had any real interest in hunting. The only thing that might distract you from your present mission would be more love making, as finding out that Luna loved you was a very influential thing. Particularly as while you had thought Luna the only girl worth dating growing up, you also had the sense that you&#39;d only be friends and nothing more. Therefore, you&#39;d never taken the risk of hurting that friendship. In finding out that Luna was a born MILF-wolf, you also soon found that she had loved you. It was, as though she had had the same thoughts about you as you grew up together and didn&#39;t act on those thoughts for the same reasons, though, the fact that she was a MILF-wolf probably played a role in it. For people knew about werewolves, but when the MILF-wolf variant came out and spread rapidly, many countries began putting tighter controls over nighttime activity.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t so much out of fear, as by the present day, the number of confirmed cases where a normal werewolf attacked and killed a human was a rate of one for every million people in a given area, and often times the police had found that the reason for the attack came back to arguments at work, over lovers, money, and many of the other things that humans most often murdered other humans for. This served to confirm that werewolves and MILF-wolves were not instinctive threats to people. However, the reports you&#39;d seen on MILF-wolves gave an indication that they were much more interested in sex than regular werewolves which had lead to a fair number of reported incidents in which a new MILF-wolf reported walking home one night, running into a MILF-wolf and ended up being seduced without much else to say, and the new MILF-wolf had often been male before becoming a MILF-wolf. Learning that Luna&#39;s mom, Kellie, was the first MILF-wolf could allow for more answers on that, but to an extent, you now had first hand experience with a MILF-wolf&#39;s lusts. As soon as Luna started getting wet while talking about her discoveries at having a foot fetish and you picked up the scent, you started getting wet too.<br />
<br />
That proved to be enough for the government to do its best to make sure that people stayed inside and anyone who became either a regular werewolf or a MILF-wolf did so willingly and thus nothing was spreading uncontrolled. This meant that forests at night were often devoid of human activity to avoid accidental infections with either the regular werewolf strain of the virus or the MILF-wolf variant. Your transformation was quite willing, and thus that didn&#39;t concern you at the moment. Much of your personal attention was on Luna and wanting to reward her for finally making you female, but for the moment, she had her own family responsibilities in showing her father, Roxie, the MILF-wolf she had become. That thus had the two of you moving into the woods looking for Kellie&#39;s mother and her mate.<br />
<br />
At one time, such a search would have seemed hard to you as the woods were relatively thick and in the low light near impossible for the human eye to see in. But now you weren&#39;t human. You&#39;d happily become a MILF-wolf and your golden eyes could actually see in the dark quite well and you strode through the woods with Luna unconcerned about running into things that you couldn&#39;t otherwise see. For you could see. The bigger thing, though, was that your senses of hearing and smell were greatly enhanced as well. Your ears moved on a constant swivel and you could hear birds rustling in their nests in the trees, you could hear some howls and barks in the far distance, which you assumed would be either other werewolves of some kind. At the same time your sense of smell had grown even more and you could smell everything. You caught Luna&#39;s scent and it was lovely, and oddly both your male and female scents were still on Luna from your transformation and both turned you on a bit, but you put that to a side for a moment as you and Luna walked into the woods. Luna actually took the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have their scent?&quot; you asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have my mom&#39;s scent,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;my sense of smell was just as good as yours before my real form emerged. Thus... I&#39;m kinda adapting to all the new sounds and smells too... but since mom was nearby when I changed and was there for a few moments after I completed my transformation... I have her scent. She has Roxie&#39;s scent, and unless Roxie&#39;s gone hunting for deer, they&#39;ll likely be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they might be having fun...&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but like my mom... Roxie has been waiting for me to take on this form for eighteen years,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;so... she&#39;ll want to see the new me. And she and Kellie will want to meet the new you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope they approve of me,&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve approved of you before... and mom&#39;s response when you came into the house was more out of surprise than any personal opinion on you,&quot; Luna assured you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but we were only just friends before,&quot; you answered, &quot;now... the last thing I did as a male was get you pregnant and we&#39;d be coming to them as lovers. Even if Kellie was all for this... I&#39;d imagine that Roxie might still have the sort of protect &quot;his&quot; baby girl type thoughts that would relate to being a former male... and likely not transgender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roxie isn&#39;t transgender, at least not in the way that you were,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;her transformation was more the result of my mom not knowing just what the MILF-wolf strain of the were virus does. But they will accept you. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you continued on, making your way through the woods, listening to the night sounds and letting Luna track her mother&#39;s scent. After a few moments the two of you began to approach a clearing that was near a small stream and as you got closer, your ears picked up other voices than yours or Luna&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Luna transformed in her own good time,&quot; one mature female voice spoke, which you recognized as Roxie. While your ability to tell individual scents was new as a MILF-wolf, that didn&#39;t mean you&#39;d never heard Roxie speak before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; came Kellie&#39;s answer, &quot;you were right... but... can you really blame a loving mother wanting to see her daughter grow and prosper?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t blame you for wanting to see Luna succeed and prosper, Kellie,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;I&#39;d hoped Luna would transform on her eighteenth birthday too. But as I said... time and nature may have its own schedule. And who knows... maybe rushing Luna&#39;s change might have mutated the MILF-wolf strain in Luna to the point where it mutates again. Like how the case of the sniffles in the werewolf that bit you created the MILF-wolf strain... but this mutation may create a strain that kills rather than being symbiotic. And that&#39;s on the worst case scenario. Remember that both of us nursed Luna as an infant. That didn&#39;t accelerate her transformation at all. Thus... you might not have even changed anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said you were right,&quot; Kellie answered, sounding a bit irritated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And anyway... from what you&#39;ve told me, the boy that she&#39;s been sweet on also showed up,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;so it&#39;s likely that he is now a she.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sweet on,&quot; Kellie corrected, &quot;sweet on would assume they&#39;d been dating. I said she likely loves him but hasn&#39;t been brave enough to admit it TO him. But yes... he also seemed to have an interest in MILF-wolves and thus not only is he a she... but the last thing he probably did as a he was get Luna pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now I&#39;m jealous,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;I got you pregnant with Luna... then you became a MILF-wolf and thus so did Luna. Then I became a MILF-wolf with you and I got to see you carry Luna... and now... the newest member of our pack impregnates Luna... I&#39;m going to be a grandma before I become an actual mother because all the regular werewolves went off after elk and deer a whole county over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like your dad wants to get pregnant,&quot; you whispered to Luna and catching her by the arm so that you remained deep enough in the woods where Roxie and Kellie wouldn&#39;t hear you or see you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she does,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;and in time... so will you. For remember while the were virus lives more in symbiosis with werewolves and MILF-wolves it will still want to replicate. Which means it can&#39;t be something that prevents there from being males and females. It&#39;s why regular werewolves appear to be immune to the MILF-wolf strain. It means that any human man could catch it and become a MILF-wolf but a male werewolf wouldn&#39;t. We can then mate with them and continue our species well after old age claims us.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blinked for a moment and then remembered some of the things you&#39;d gotten in high school on werewolves and what speculation was then raised with regard to MILF-wolves. They could live longer than normal people, but no werewolf was ever found to be immortal and things that could kill people could kill werewolves of call kinds just as easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Otherwise... the whole world would become female and then we would all die and leave Earth with out any humans, werewolves, or MILF-wolves to live on it,&quot; Luna finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t you think that cheating if that were to happen with me?&quot; you asked to Luna taking her hands in yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you love me?&quot; Luna asked firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I had a bit of fear in working up the courage to ask you out and all that... I think that was always there,&quot; you answered, &quot;and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to do anything that would hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Luna assured you, &quot;if at some point in the future you want to have a baby... I know that&#39;s just the instincts in you that wants to be a mother. All MILF-wolves have it. What do you think the m in MILF-wolf stands for? It&#39;s also part of why I wanted you to get me pregnant... because I love you and while I will be happy to live out my days with my sexy MILF-wolf mate, I&#39;d wanted to have something that you and I could have that is a combination of the two of us. And OUR daughter will be that.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled and then hugged Luna too you and she hugged you back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let&#39;s go say high to my mom and Roxie,&quot; Luna said and then lead you forward and holding your hand.<br />
<br />
It was a few short paces more before you came out to see where Kellie and Roxie were. It was in an open spot where the stream cut through the forest. It wasn&#39;t fast flowing or dangerous, and was no more that three feet deep at most. Laying across it was an old oak tree, which had a rather chewed base, which made you think a beaver had cut the tree down but couldn&#39;t get it small enough to take to its dam and leaving the tree bridging the stream. Seated on the trunk were two MILF-wolves. One you recognized as Kellie with her black fur and straight hair, the other looked almost identical to Luna with blonde fur. The difference between Luna and Roxie was that Luna had straight hair like Kellie while Roxie actually had her hair done in curls. The two of them were seated on the trunk of the tree with their arms around the other&#39;s shoulders and looked rather loving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mom, &quot;dad,&quot; it&#39;s me,&quot; Luna called as you two came into the clearing and approached the stump of the treat that had been cut down.<br />
<br />
Both Kellie and Roxie turned to look to you and Luna, and it let you see two mature and smiling lupine faces. Roxie&#39;s eyes seemed to focus on Luna as she got up from where she was seated and approached Luna with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And look at you,&quot; Roxie said to Luna, &quot;beautiful and mature, what one would expect from a MILF-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it from you and mom,&quot; Luna replied and returned the hug.<br />
<br />
Roxie then paused to look you over. While the two of you stood on near equal footing in terms of height and musculature, there was still the knowledge that Roxie was Luna&#39;s biological father before Roxie became a MILF-wolf. There was still that whole &quot;protective father vibe&quot; that you sensed even if she accepted you being involved with Luna. Things were silent for a moment as Kellie came up to stand to Roxie&#39;s right, while Luna was to your Right.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you do make a nice looking MILF-wolf,&quot; Roxie said to you, &quot;and this is what you wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Ms. Vaxer,&quot; you spoke, using the words you&#39;d always addressed Roxie as before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Roxie,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;physically we&#39;re all mature women here. No need to be formal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Roxie,&quot; you said slowly, &quot;and I promise I&#39;ll treat Luna right. You may not have seen this while we were growing up... but... she&#39;s always been there for me. And it sort of hit me as I turned into this... that... well, I think I&#39;ve loved her for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like I love Kellie,&quot; Roxie smiled, &quot;we&#39;ll be there to help you two as you and Luna start your own path to parenthood together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; was all you could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Nick,&quot; Kellie then addressed you with a bit of a smile, &quot;how do you like being a MILF-wolf and part of the family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it,&quot; you answered, &quot;I feel in the right gender now... and I learned that Luna&#39;s loved me too. That&#39;s great... Though given the big breasts I&#39;ve grown and the vagina that has replaced all the old male equipment... I&#39;m Nicole now... or Nickie for short... or Nicki or Nikki. The exact spelling doesn&#39;t bother me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The biggest thing will be dealing with my father,&quot; you said with a sigh, &quot;among other things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help,&quot; Roxie nodded and held Kellie&#39;s hand, &quot;and since all the male werewolves went off on their own adventure for the night, we have the time...&quot;</p>
