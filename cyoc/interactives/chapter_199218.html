<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Steve’s surprise, Thomas gave him a kiss before going to clean himself up. He expected that his pervy little brother just wanted to use his hole to dump a load in, but now he was still being treated tenderly by him after the fact. It was kind of romantic.<br />
<br />
When Thomas left, Steve was exhausted. He chugged the tall glass of water he kept by his bed. His cellphone chimed. It was a pic from his girlfriend, Wednesday. It turns out that in this universe she had a cock and balls. Even though her junk was both longer and thicker than Thomas’, and even Steve’s former junk, Steve felt nothing for the picture she had sent. <br />
<br />
Steve held no attraction for Wednesday now. He pondered if it was his new anatomy, but the truth was, he liked the feeling of a man taking power over his body like the way his little brother did, and even though Wednesday had the same type of equipment, she was still a woman. Steve had never let himself realize his attraction to men because he never felt like he had access to them. Now he knew that some men would be dying to shove their pleasure sticks in his easy hole. The men who had dicks, that is.<br />
<br />
Steve couldn’t respond to Wednesday yet. He was still working out the whole attraction to men thing and was very tired from being railed. He instead took a nap in his bed without even cleaning Thomas’ cum out of his hole. He awoke several hours later, feeling refreshed again.<br />
<br />
Getting in the shower, Steve cleaned his brother’s spunk out of his hole. Even cleaning it aroused his new anatomy and he had to fight the urge to jerk his pussy off. He toweled off and grabbed his phone off of the nightstand.<br />
<br />
“Wednesday,<br />
<br />
I don’t know how else to say this, but I think we need to call it quits. I know we were supposed to lose our virginity together today, but I just don’t think that’s something I want with you. I understand if you’re mad, but I had to be honest. I hope we can be friends,” Steve texted to Wednesday.<br />
<br />
She got angry and texted back going off about how this was only happening to her because she was a dick girl and she ‘knew’ he was leaving her to find a vag girl. He responded patiently, explaining that it was her gender and not her anatomy that didn’t correspond to his sexuality. She seemed more satisfied with that and sort of agreed to be friends in a slightly passive aggressive way. “Could have been worse”, thought Steve.<br />
<br />
As Steve got dressed after his shower and breakup, he noticed something about his underwear drawer in this universe. His boxers and briefs were all replaced by frilly or silky panties. He tried on a bronze colored pair of the solid silk ones to find it fit him perfectly. Looking in the mirror there was nothing much to see in the front but a slight camel toe, but in the back his hairy male bubble butt was well accentuated by the undergarment. He gave his ass a squeeze before putting on an exceedingly normal pair of jeans and tshirt.<br />
<br />
Wanting to get to know this new, if not mostly familiar world, Steve decided to go for a walk around his neighborhood. The smell of ribs, corn, hot dogs, and hamburgers was in the air. He saw why when he got close to his neighbor Julian’s house.<br />
<br />
“Hey, come on over Steve! We’re having a pool party and barbecue,” greeted Julian. He was at the grill wearing nothing but a speedo and Steve could clearly see the man’s penis and balls through the fabric. He had never noticed before, but Julian Reys was quite a hunky guy. The blond short haired man had a mustache and beard, a great big beer belly and an upper body loaded with muscle. From the side profile it was also obvious that this man was packing some serious ass. Steve wished he had a penis again just to know what it would feel like to penetrate this manly man’s round cheeks into his potentially virgin man-hole.<br />
<br />
Steve metaphorically pulled his jaw back up and responded, “Oh but I didn’t remember a swimsuit. Would it be okay if I swam in my underwear?”<br />
<br />
“Oh course neighbor!” Said Julian excitedly. Maybe he was curious about what parts I have, wondered Steve.<br />
<br />
Steve shucked his jeans and shirt, leaving himself only in the silk panties. All eyes were on him. Most people went swimming in trunks so that nobody would know which genitals they had, however it wasn’t unheard of to swim in one’s underwear, so nobody could really say anything about the spectacle. Nude beaches were still a thing in Europe in this world, it was mainly Americans who were uptight about genitals, except the few like Julian who chose more revealing European swimwear.<br />
<br />
“You’re burning my burger!” Said Maurice, Julian’s wife. That’s went Steve noticed how intently Julian had been watching him undress. Steve intentionally dropped something on the grass so that he had to bend his ass in Julian’s direction. Julian burned yet another burger.<br />
<br />
Maurice was practically fuming. Judging by a bit of a bulge in her swim trunks, she was a woman with a dick. She could not keep her husbands eyes tied down and clearly resented him for it. For a moment Steve wondered how the two had kids when they both had penises. Then he realized that the kids they had in this universe looked different. They were adopted.<br />
<br />
Steve swam for a while in their pool, stealing glances at Julian when he thought he could without being noticed. Maurice had calmed down and even fell asleep sunbathing. When Steve got out of the pool, Julian gave him a burger on a styrofoam plate and asked, “Want any ketchup?”<br />
<br />
Before Steve could even start to say ‘sure’,  Julian started to squirt ketchup, and a lot of it missed the plate and landed on Steve’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry about that Steve, let’s go inside and get you cleaned up,” said Julian.<br />
<br />
Once inside, Julian grabbed some wet paper towels and started to dab Steve’s crotch clean. Steve couldn’t care less about the pair of panties being destroyed, considering he didn’t even know they existed until he went through his underwear drawer.<br />
<br />
“I can get it,” Steve practically moaned. The sensation of Julian patting his pussy had him in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
“Nonsense, this is my mess and I gotta clean it up,” said Julian in amusement. He could tell that he was turning Steve on.<br />
<br />
“Wow so they do get erections too,” said Julian, noticing Steve’s clit through the fabric.<br />
<br />
Steve blushed profusely, saying, “Big deal, I bet I could get you hard too.”<br />
<br />
“Oh I wish you would boy. There’s something so sexy about a man that I could just stick my dong right in the front of,” said Julian, standing up and completely changing his tone.<br />
<br />
Steve put his hand down the front of Julian’s speedo. This was the first male junk he’d handled since Thomas fucked him three hours ago. It was so fun to feel it grow hard in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, well I think there’s something really hot about a man who could penetrate me in a moment’s notice,” said Steve, owning his new sexual identity.<br />
<br />
The two men started making out. Their hands ravenously scoured each other’s unfamiliar bodies. Whoever said that men don’t have curves had never felt up Julian’s impressive ass or thick thighs. Julian fingered Steve’s ass while also pressing his erection up against his cunt. Steve wouldn’t have guessed that he was into anal play himself, but it actually felt really good. There was pressure on both of his holes and he would’ve let Julian take either.<br />
<br />
Julian flipped Steve around right there in the kitchen and lubed up his ass. He worked his cock slowly up into the virgin ass. Steve moaned through some minor pain before it turned into pleasure. His g-spot was being hit through the anal canal and his front started squirting. That’s when Julian put both of Steve’s arms in a headlock behind him.<br />
<br />
“He’s all yours son,” said Julian.<br />
<br />
“What?” Asked Steve, but he realized what was happening when Julian’s son Abe came into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“You see Steve, the men in our family that end up with dicks have had this bonding ritual for generations. We take a man like you (he gestured with a nod to Steve’s pussy) and we have our way with him, at the same time. When I was becoming a man, my dad and I had to settle for fucking my grandpa together, but truth be told it was a lot more fun than I thought it would be. I made my own hulking grandpa moan like a bitch in heat when I fucked his pussy with my dad in his ass,” explained Julian.<br />
<br />
Abe, unlike his hairy dad, had a naturally smooth body and a shaved face. His mid length blond hair brought attention to his pretty brown eyes. He had the skinny build of a runner but also a nice bubble butt from being a runner too. He came up without asking and stuck his six inch long and plenty thick erection straight into Steve’s pussy.<br />
<br />
Steve was shocked. He wanted to complain, to protest. Here he was being taken by a father and son for some stupid bonding ritual. He realized why he wasn’t saying anything... He was actually enjoying his rape. He let the two men have full reign over his body, feeling both of their dicks go in and out like his favorite song on replay, giving into the pleasure and moaning whorishly.<br />
<br />
At one point Steve looked up and noticed a mirror in front on him across the kitchen. He could see that Abe and Julian were actually making out with one another while they fucked his holes. He could also see Abe’s smooth nice bubble butt in the mirror. He got his arms down from the headlock and grabbed Abe’s butt cheeks, separating them and getting a look at his pink hole through the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s not like he asked to use my hole,” thought Steve, penetrating his assaulter who was still fucking him. He felt Abe start to pulse and hump harder from the stimulation on his prostate.<br />
<br />
“Oh dad, I’m gonna cum!” Moaned Abe.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah, me too son,” said Julian, who was also watching his son’s soft ass get fingered in the mirror reflection as well.<br />
<br />
The three men orgasmed simultaneously. It was an almost religious experience. Now Abe and Steve could see the importance of this ritual. <br />
<br />
“Oh ffuck that was good,” said Julian, “I hope we can all be discrete about this?”<br />
<br />
“Sure but my silence is gonna cost ya,” said Steve in a tone that sounded half serious.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah?” Asked Julian.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Whenever I want a hole stuffed, one of you too is gonna do that for me,” Steve said, taking control but laughing in a teasing way too.<br />
<br />
“I think we can manage that,” said Abe, going in for a kiss. Steve kissed the handsome young face back with equal passion.</p>
