<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It has been five weeks since Josie became a part of the household. During that time Kathy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Pfaster next door. Denise had graduated high school and was the class valedictorian. Both Karen and Denise were helping out at the transformation clinic. Karen had asked if Rick could also help and her mother said she would ask Dr. Mezzner. As it turned out Dr. Wheeler wanted an assistant and he was eager to have Rick assist him.<br />
<br />
Karen could remember one day just two weeks after Josie joined their household. She and her mother were assisting Dr. Mezzner and Rick was assisting Dr. Wheeler. It was nearing six o'clock at night when they would be going home for dinner. A couple had brought in their twin boy and girl. They were changing gender, age, and even species rapidly. The rapid transforming was causing them great pain. They had<br />
come into contact with a mysterious white powder just before they started transforming. Their parents had taken them to the emergency room at the hospital at first though they couldn't do anything for them. Fortunately one of the ER doctors knew of the clinic and arranged for an ambulance to bring them here. Once they were able to get them scanned they found that both of them now had female genetics that were constant over the changes. The worst part was that if they didn't stabilize the transformation soon they would<br />
die. Fortunately their father had scooped up some of the powder and brought it with them. It was a new substance that no one had come across before. After analyzing it they were able to find a way to stabilize them. They ended up being ten year old twin neko girls.<br />
<br />
The girls were exhausted from the ordeal and still in pain. Doctors Mezzner and Wheeler agreed that they should remain at the clinic for at least a week to make sure they were ok. When they had asked for volunteers to stay with them Karen immediately volunteered. The first night was pretty rough for them and they woke up screaming many times. The next nights became better until they stayed asleep through the night their last night at the clinic. During the day they<br />
gradually became accustomed to their new lives. The new girl took a little longer than her sister to adjust but she did. When Dr. Mezzner had asked them if they would like to stay that way they both said yes and their parents didn't object. In fact they seemed happy to have ten year old twin girls. They even thought that them being nekos was neat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Karen&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Do we have anyone coming in for an appointment today.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was early morning and Karen was once again assisting Dr. Mezzner. She had been going through the days appointments when she slipped into her memories of that night. &quot;Sorry Dr. Mezzner&quot; she apologized. &quot;I was just remembering the night Tina and Tanya came in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a nightmare that was&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;I had hoped that I'd never see a case like that. I'm just glad we were able to save them. Now what prompted this trip down memory lane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're suppose to come in for their weekly exam at ten&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Anyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Josie is suppose to be in at noon for her weekly exam&quot; Karen said. She was glad that Josie had become comfortable enough for people to call her Josie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish there was more that we could do for her&quot; Dr. Mezzner said with a sigh and a sad look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still haven't been able to get much from that monster?&quot; Karen asked. She hated Josie's father for that he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;No we haven't&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;All he would say was that he wasn't going to change Josie back. Whether that means he could or could not is anybodies guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be easier if we could get him here and read his memories&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been over this before Karen&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;They won't let him out unless he's seriously ill. Even if we get him here it's risky to put his memories in someone else. They could end up insane or just as big a monster as he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Karen said with a sigh. &quot;Still it would be easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't bet on it&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Anyone else have an appointment today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny Dahlmer has her monthly exam at three&quot; Karen said. &quot;And Jackie Dennison has her semi-annual exam at five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a busy day then&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Well let's make sure the equipment is working properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Karen said. &quot;Which do you want to check first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to test the bio-scanner first since we have Tanya, Tina, and Josie coming in today&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Then we'll test the tran-scanner. After that we'll test the Chronivac and analyzer. We'll test the portal generator next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fun&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
They spent the next two hours testing the various equipment. The Chronivac was a recent addition to the clinic. It allowed for the transformation of something living into something else living except plants. The first time they had tested it they found that it wouldn't transform someone who had been transformed by the Medallion of Zulo. Dr. Mezzner theorized that Zulo was blocking the transformation since it could cause harm.<br />
<br />
When they tested the portal generator Karen was able to speak with Michelle who was at one time her father. She did remember him but as Katie's father. When she had asked Dr. Mezzner about that after the first time she spoke to Michelle she had told her that Dana Serwinsky had arranged it so that each of them had a different father who died before they were born. Now that was fixed and what people knew was he ran off with someone.<br />
<br />
Michelle's transformation was strange. As Karen's father she had used the Medallion of Zulo on a fairy costume for a little girl. The costume was Karen's when she was six and the medallion should have turned her father into her at six. Instead it had transformed him into a real fairy. No one knew how it happened but Dr. Mezzner said that however it had happened it couldn't be reversed. Michelle was stuck as a fairy though she had adjusted well to it.<br />
<br />
Karen was surprised at how tiny Michelle was when she first saw her. During their first meeting Michelle had greeted Karen by landing on her hand. After that she would hug her neck.<br />
<br />
Michelle still considered Karen her daughter and was angry that she had had sex with Rick. Though once her mom explained what happened with the medallion Michelle understood. She was a little sad that the daughter born to them was now someone else's son but that's the way it works sometimes. Karen had all of her memories as Karen and she was pretty close in personality so it was almost like she was their daughter born to them.<br />
<br />
They finished checking the equipment and Dr. Mezzner said &quot;I want to make Tanya and Tina's exam as short as possible today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want to do that?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their mother had called me yesterday and told me that their going to join Girl Scouts&quot; Dr. Mezzner explained. &quot;They need to be out of here by ten thirty if everything checks out ok with them. I've decided to put them in exam room six to get them out of here on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exam room six has two bio-scanners&quot; Karen said. &quot;Who do you want to run the second one? I'll go ahead and get them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need for that&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;I've already spoken to everyone and they all agree that you should be the one to run it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Karen asked incredulously. &quot;I'm not a doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know how to run it and how to read the read outs&quot; Dr. Mezzner said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's from watching you though&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the way I learned&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;When I started working here I wasn't a doctor yet. I was just like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if there's something wrong?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;I'll be right there in the same room. If there is something wrong all you have to do is tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I mess up though?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that you won't&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;I have every confidence in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dr. Mezzner&quot; Karen said. &quot;I'll try to not let you down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you won't&quot; Dr. Mezzner said.<br />
<br />
Just then the receptionist buzzed Dr. Mezzner and told her that Tina and Tanya were here.<br />
<br />
Upon entering exam room six Dr. Mezzner said &quot;Good morning Tina, Tanya. How are you two today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Dr. Mezzner&quot; Tina said. &quot;I'm fine except for a little soreness and itching in my chest. Tanya says that it's my breasts growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Mezzner giggled and said &quot;Could be. You are at the right age for puberty to start. We'll know after the exam. Now, how are you Tanya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm good&quot; Tanya said. &quot;I can't wait to get my breasts again. I still have another year to go until I enter puberty again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya had been female and seventeen before she came in contact with that strange powder. It must be maddening to have gone through puberty once and to know you'd be going through it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you two like being nekos?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's different&quot; Tanya said. She had sandy brown hair and the fur on her tail and ears was the same color.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it&quot; Tina said. She had black hair and the fur on her tail and ears was also black. She was a seventeen year old male before coming into contact with the strange powder. Her name at that time had been Tim and she was the twin brother of Tanya. Now they were twin sisters though obviously not identical twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad that you're enjoying yourselves&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Now we need to begin the exam so we can get you girls out of here in time for you to go to Girl Scouts. Tina, Karen will be the one examining you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Karen and Dr. Mezzner took out tran-scanners. They looked like a PDA with a wire running to a thin rod. It detected the energy left behind on someone from a transformation. As Karen passed the rod over Tina she looked at the screen on the device. It showed that the energy was decaying at a normal rate. In a couple of years there would be no trace of the energy left on Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything ok Karen?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Strip and lay down on the exam tables.&quot;<br />
<br />
When they had stripped and laid down on the exam tables Dr. Mezzner and Karen went to the monitors for the bio-scanners. Karen was nervous about this part. She thought she had seen the slightest breast buds on Tina when she took off her dress and she didn't know what would be displayed on the monitor. She took a deep breath and ran the scanner through it's routines. She looked over what was displayed carefully. Karen breathed a sigh of relief as she found that she didn't need to be nervous. The scanner showed that Tina was a healthy ten year old neko girl who was starting puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are things with Tina?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great&quot; Karen said. &quot;She's a healthy ten year old neko girl. She is starting puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell how big my breasts will be?&quot; Tina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Karen answered. &quot;This scanner doesn't show that.&quot;<br />
<br />
They finished the exam and made an appointment for them for next week. The girls had each picked out a scrunchy from the drawer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did an excellent job Karen&quot; Dr. Mezzner said after Tina and Tanya left. &quot;I knew you could do it. You'll make a great doctor if that's the way you want to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Dr. Mezzner&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
During the next hour and a half they had a teenage girl come in. She was originally a teenage boy but a friend had dared him to drink a white substance. He did and it switched his gender. The tran-scanner confirmed that she had been transformed and the bio-scanner said that she was healthy. Dr. Mezzner asked her if she wanted to stay like that or switch back. She asked if she could have a week to decide which Dr. Mezzner was happy to give her. When she left Dr.<br />
Mezzner gave Karen the task of putting her in the system as a girl for now.<br />
<br />
Karen had just finished entering the new teenage girl into the system and thus the world when Josie came in for her appointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing today Josie?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm good&quot; Josie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you liking living with Miss Punnit and her family?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it&quot; Josie said. &quot;I want to stay with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll do what we can to make that happen&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;Now let's get on with your exam.&quot; She took out the tran-scanner and scanned Josie. Karen was able to see that the energy Josie was emitting hadn't gone down at all. The bio-scanner said that she was healthy and that there was no sign of any problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're still healthy Josie&quot; Dr. Mezzner said once Josie was dressed again.<br />
<br />
At this point Rick and Denise came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello beautiful&quot; Rick greeted Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello handsome&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're free I was wondering if you'd like to grab some lunch now&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and go to lunch Karen&quot; Dr. Mezzner said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, thanks&quot; Karen said as she headed out the door.<br />
<br />
Karen's mom drove them to a nearby restaurant to eat. As they were eating she showed them a dress that she had bought for Katie for her tenth birthday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I hold it Miss Punnit?&quot; Josie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, just don't get it dirty&quot; Karen's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't&quot; Josie said as Karen's mom handed the dress to her.<br />
<br />
As Josie was holding the dress Rick accidentally bumped into her. When he did a red spark leaped between them and Rick started to transform. Josie had stood up to hold the dress up to herself and when Rick started to transform she backed up into Denise and Karen. A red spark leaped between them and Josie and they started transforming too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put the dress down Josie&quot; Karen's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean to do this&quot; Josie whined with tears streaming down her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you didn't&quot; Karen's mom said. &quot;Though please put the dress down before anyone else is accidentally transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie did as Karen's mom said and put down the dress.<br />
<br />
During this Karen was regressing. She shrunk down, her breasts shrunk like they were deflating, her hips narrowed while her waist widened. In seconds she was ten years old again and she had to hold up her pants. She could see that Denise had also regressed back to ten years old. Rick had not only regressed to ten years old but he had also changed gender again.<br />
<br />
Karen saw her mom looking at them with a frightened look on her face. Finally she said &quot;We need to get back to the clinic. Fortunately we already paid.&quot; She gathered up the dress and took Josie's hand.<br />
<br />
Karen had difficulty walking because her shoes were too big as well as her pants. She noticed that Denise and Rick were having the same trouble. She knew that this wasn't the same power as the Medallion of Zulo as she was transformed while she was having her period. The medallion wouldn't have done that.<br />
<br />
Back at the clinic they were in exam room ten which had three bio-scanners. Dr. Mezzner and two other female doctors came in. Karen recognized them as Doctors Delphi and Whitefeather.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Dr. Mezzner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josie was holding a dress when Rick accidentally bumped into her&quot; Karen's mom said. &quot;When he started to transform she backed up into Karen and Denise and they transformed. I brought them here immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok we'll get them checked out&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. She and the other two brought out tran-scanners and ran them over them.<br />
<br />
Noticing Dr. Mezzner's frown Karen asked &quot;What's the matter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The residual energy from the transformation is higher than what it should be&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;In fact it's about as high as the energy Josie emits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Karen's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it means that they won't be able to be transformed for several years to come&quot; Dr. Mezzner said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So they may have to go through puberty again?&quot; Karen's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like they might have to&quot; Dr. Mezzner said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is really fair&quot; Denise said. &quot;I just graduated and now I'll have to go through school again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least your still a girl&quot; Rick said. &quot;I changed sex again. I had gotten used to being a boy and now I'm a girl again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think that you would be happy&quot; Karen said. &quot;I'm a girl still. Not that I'm complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was happy being a boy&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's enough bickering you two&quot; Karen's mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Rick is complaining that he's a girl again&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He had gotten used to being a boy&quot; Karen's mom said. &quot;I know that you'd be complaining if you found yourself a boy again after you had gotten used to being a girl. Now I'm sure that Doctors Mezzner, Delphi, and Whitefeather want to get on with the exam. So all three of you strip and get up on the tables.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen recognized the tone that her mom used when she would hear no arguments. Of course when she used that tone it meant that if you didn't do as she told you, you would be punished. So Karen quickly stripped and as she did she saw her hairless crotch. That and her lack of boobs confirmed that she was in her prepuberty years. She wouldn't need a bra for a couple of years yet.<br />
<br />
After the exam Dr. Mezzner said &quot;Well they're healthy and there's no sign of any problems. I do want them in here every week to make sure that no problems arise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will we still be able to help here?&quot; Denise asked.<br />
<br />
It was a few moments before Dr. Mezzner answered. When she did she said &quot;Well if you want to help when you're here you can. Just so you know, we won't be able to pay you like we did before. Child labor laws and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are going to freak when they find out that I've become a girl again&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll call them and ask them to come in&quot; Dr. Mezzner said. &quot;In the meantime you girls need to get some clothes. Alice, go ahead and take them to the clothes storage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Denise asked.</p>
