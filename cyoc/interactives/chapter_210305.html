<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mel pushed the stroller down the sidewalk towards the park Heather wiggled her way as far back into the seat as she would go. Mel had flipped out the little sunshade, but it didn&#39;t provide anywhere near the cover she desired. It seemed as though she didn&#39;t need to worry though. It was a bright sunny day and a lot of her neighbors were out working in their yards, washing their cars, and just generally enjoying the nice weather. None of them acted as if it was strange to see 15 year old Heather dressed as a baby and being pushed down the sidewalk in a stroller by her best friend. It&#39;s not like they couldn&#39;t see her. Several of them waved and one or two even stopped to say good day. To say it was weird would be an understatement.<br />
<br />
It would take a bit to walk all the way to the park so Heather decided that she should take advantage of this and try to piece together just what had happened. The diapers were the cause, there was no doubt about that in her mind. She had been so caught up in the excitement of trying them on that she had ignored what were quite obviously warning signs. That booklet probably had the answers she needed. It had definitely not been in her panties when she had been wearing them, it must have been added when the change happened. And the fact that her panties had stayed when every other piece of adult clothing had vanished was important too. Mel had thought they were just a toy, and hadn&#39;t been able to see the booklet, that had to be part of all this.<br />
<br />
That brought up the subject of Mel. Clearly they were still very close friends despite the massive changes that had been made. The way she acted made it seem like she was used to Heather being this way. Her strength was surprising though. Mel could barely lift her own 40lb backpack for school and yet she was able to carry 100+lbs of Heather like it was nothing. The question was had the changes made her stronger or Heather lighter? She would have to experiment later. Her own strength was worrying her too. As far as she could tell she hadn&#39;t become any weaker, but the buckles holding her into the stroller still would not budge and Mel had been able to overpower her with ease. She would have to experiment more with that as well.<br />
<br />
Then there was the rules of this strange new world. The changes to her room indicated that she was expected to wear diapers and act like a child. The stroller and diaper bag just reinforced that point even more. But wait, Mel had said she was &#39;playing pretend&#39; today. What did that mean? Heather tried to piece together the scant clues she had been given so far. Mel had said that she was wearing thick play diapers and that her normal clothes wouldn&#39;t fit over them. That probably meant she usually wore thinner diapers, maybe ones that didn&#39;t force her legs so far apart. She had seen the &#39;normal&#39; clothes that Mel had picked and they looked quite ordinary for a teen girl, if a little brightly colored. Add in the comments Mel had made about the stroller and diaper bag and Heather guessed that in this reality she always wore diapers but sometimes she acted more like a teen girl and other times she &#39;played pretend&#39; as Mel put it. She figured the booklet would tell her more, if she could just get her hands on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re he~re!&quot; Mel announced in a sing-song voice.<br />
<br />
Heather was pulled away from her thoughts by this announcement, and away from her seat as Mel unbuckled her and lifted her from the stroller. She looked around cautiously. It was the park, same as it had always been. The playground, the baseball field, the long jogging paths, everything was still where it should be. Mel sat her on the ground at the edge of the playground and pushed the stroller up next to the other, more ordinary ones that mothers and babysitters had left while they watched their little ones play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Mel exclaimed, stretching her hands high above her head. &quot;Let&#39;s have some fun! It looks like the swings are still open, let&#39;s start there.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took off at a brisk and long-legged walk towards the swings. Heather went to push herself to her feet but the bulky diaper kept her legs so far apart that the most she could manage was a slow, bow-legged toddle.<br />
<br />
&#39;At least I can stand.&#39; she thought. &#39;My legs seem to work just fine, it&#39;s just this diaper that gets in the way.&#39;<br />
<br />
Dropping back to her hands and knees, Heather tried crawling instead. This worked far better. The cut of the diaper made it so her legs could get a little closer together when she stayed on all fours. It was still bulky and awkward but she was able to manage it. Her arms also seemed strong enough to hold her up, but that wouldn&#39;t mean much if her weight had changed as well. She scurried after her friend at a pace that was quicker than her usual walking speed, but still far slower than Mel who was almost at the swings and turning to see what was taking her so long. Heather picked up the pace and soon joined her friend at the swings.<br />
<br />
&quot;What took ya&#39;?&quot; Mel was grinning. &quot;Is that diaper weighing you down?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather shook her head. The diaper was bulky, but not heavy. She was shocked when Mel reached down and gave the padding around her crotch a squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, still dry.&quot; She looked at Heather&#39;s face for a moment then said, &quot;Oh! I completely forgot!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel reached into her pocket and pulled out a couple of hair ties and used them to put Heather&#39;s long hair up into two pigtails. Then she reached into another pocket and pulled out a pacifier. It was just like the one Heather had stolen from her brother&#39;s room that morning, only sized for her mouth and pink. Mel brushed the pocket lint off of it and held it in front of Heather&#39;s lips. Not seeing any way out of it, Heather opened her mouth and accepted the rubber nipple. Mel smiled as she began to suck it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too cute sometimes, ya know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather blushed at the compliment. Mel grabbed a hold of one of the swings and planted her skinny hips onto its seat and began swinging. Heather grabbed the seat of the one next to her and pulled herself to her feet. It was a bit awkward but she managed to get herself lined up and lift her padded rear onto the swing. Kicking her legs to get moving was a hassle with them spread so much by the padding but soon Heather was swinging just as high as Mel was.<br />
<br />
The two teens spent the next two hours swinging on the swings, monkeying on the monkey bars, and sliding down the many long and twisty slides the park had to offer. Mel strode confidently between the different play structures with Heather scrambling to crawl after her.  Heather used the playtime to try and gauge if anything about her weight or maybe the pull of gravity had changed, but eventually the fun pushed those thoughts out of her head. Besides, everything felt normal, even Mel was showing that she hadn&#39;t gained new strength. She struggled to hold her own weight up just like she always did. Finally the two returned to where they had left the stroller. Mel pushed it to a nearby bench and sat down to rest. Heather was going to scramble up to sit next to her but she was too worn out. She plopped down at her friends feet, her own legs spread wide in front of her by her diaper. Mel looked down at her and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a little thirsty, how &#39;bout you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather just nodded. Mel reached into the diaper bag hanging from the stroller and pulled out two bottles. One was a standard juice bottle of the type sold in cafeterias and vending machines across the country. Mel sat this one next to her on the bench. The second one was definitely a baby bottle, though it was bigger than any Heather had ever seen. Big enough for her. The liquid inside looked identical to the juice inside the bottle Mel had chosen for herself. Mel popped the cap off to reveal a large rubber nipple and handed it down to Heather then plucked the pacifier from her lips. Heather blushed a bit. She had completely forgotten the pacifier. Mel stowed the pacifier in her pocket again and opened her own juice.<br />
<br />
The two girls sat in silence for a while enjoying their drinks. Heather found drinking from the bottle to be rather pleasant. She held it up with both hands and suckled thirstily at the nipple like a baby would. Mel just kept looking down between swigs of her own juice and giggling. When Heather&#39;s bottle was empty Mel took it and refilled it from another bottle in the bag and grabbed a third for herself. Before handing it back to Heather though she also pulled out a small plastic container. The container held animal crackers. Heather munched on them as she nursed her second bottle. Mel dug around and found a bag of chips for herself. Once the two had finished their snacks and drinks Mel secured the empty bottle and cracker cup back in the diaper bag, threw away the trash in a nearby can, then stretched her hands above her head again.<br />
<br />
&quot;A~ll right!&quot; she said. &quot;Who&#39;s ready for round two?&quot;<br />
<br />
They spent another three hours playing. Back and forth across the play structures they ranged, Mel striding ahead and Heather crawling frantically in her wake. Heather was starting to tire out. Her diaper seemed to gain weight and bulk as time went on. At one point she found herself passing Mel going the other way and had to turn awkwardly to catch up again. Eventually she had to stop and catch her breath. Looking around, she realized that she hadn&#39;t seen Mel in the last five minutes. Panicking a bit she looked over at the bank of strollers and saw that hers was still there. She doubted that Mel would just abandon her at the park, so she scanned her surroundings one more time, very carefully. There was Mel. Coming out of the ladies restroom, waving a hand in front of her nose in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew!&quot; She exclaimed when she had rejoined Heather. &quot;It is RANK in there! Sorry to leave you like that but I really had to go. Speaking of which.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel reached down and squeezed Heather&#39;s diaper again. This time there was a very noticeable squish to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops.&quot; Mel said sheepishly. &quot;Probably should have checked this sooner. No worries though, I got all the supplies to change you. We&#39;ll have to do it somewhere else though. Some crackhead ripped the changing table off the wall in there. Plus it stinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather wasn&#39;t listening. She was staring transfixed at the bulging crotch of her shortalls. Her diaper was wet. Soaked. It had expanded enough to stretch her shortalls to the point that one of the snaps had popped open. The problem was that she had no memory of wetting them. She didn&#39;t even remember ever feeling the need to go. But she clearly had, several times by the look of it, and she hadn&#39;t even noticed. Heather felt tears begin to well up in hers eyes. She could deal with most of the things that had been thrown at her since she had first put that diaper on, but losing control was just too much. As the first tear rolled down her cheek Mel scooped her up and began walking towards the stroller.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay sweetie.&quot; She said soothingly. &quot;There&#39;s no need to cry over a wet diaper. I&#39;ll get you changed real quick and then we can go home.&quot;</p>
