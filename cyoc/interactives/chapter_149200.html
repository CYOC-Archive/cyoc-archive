<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hugo was sitting in a corner, sipping a cup of punch someone had given him. The taste of alcohol was strong, but its effect minimal. As were that of the roofie that had disolved inside. <br />
<br />
Hugo smiled to himself, knowing that one of the guys was waiting for him to drop to either molest him or steal his camera for himself, possibly after having dicked him. It was not a bad plan, to be fair, but a homan&#39;s biology reacted very differently to drugs that affected humans. <br />
<br />
He palmed the bulge in his pants, sighing lightly as he listened to the harsh beat of music. Some guys were already playing with the dicked men he had left lying around. A bunch of frat guys were playing hot penis with one, the game being that each of them had to pump a cock a no less than three times before passing it to someone else, going in a circle, until the cock came. Then, whoever was covered in seed had to come and see him and get themselves dicked. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d taken the first cock as payment (Nick, six inches, tanned), then given the others back so they could make the game more challenging. They were passing four dicks amongst ten guys and most of them were sloppy drunks who went as fast as possible. <br />
<br />
Hugo obviously refused to play, but man, he was tempted. He really, really wanted to play with some cocks. Stupid human drugs and their stupid effects on homans. <br />
<br />
Standing, uncaring that he was showing off the tent in his pants to every passing guy, Hugo headed straight for the bowl of punch. He poured himself another cup, then, using his computer to determine he was not being watched, dropped a small colorless capsule inside. <br />
<br />
It was not a violation of the experiment&#39;s parameter, he told himself. Impaired judgment was a factor in decision-making amongst humans in the first place. And, since he had gotten such excellent results so far, his superiors were interested in seeing new developments happen. A little improvisation couldn&#39;t hurt. <br />
<br />
Some guys stumbled their way to the drinks&#39; table and, laughing and talking about innane stuff, both grabbed some punch. <br />
<br />
It took a minute and twenty four seconds. Then, Mark was being held against the wall, groped and kissed by Damian. Both were pulling at the other&#39;s clothes, frantically trying to get them off, and eventually, get off. Low wolf whistling met their intense molesting, and cheers went up. Excellent. <br />
<br />
More guys went for the punch and soon the party&#39;s dancing came to a grinding halt. Under the beats of electronic music, guys were making out everywhere, on the couch, against the tables, standing, lying on the ground. <br />
<br />
Strong arms wrapped themselves around Hugo&#39;s waist, and he almost dicked the offender by sheer reflex. However, a husky low voice murmured in his ears &quot;I wanna make you feel good.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hugo really should have had more willpower. Any form of sentimentality with his test subjects may create unacceptable bias. But then, the man&#39;s hand slid under his waistpower and Hugo thought &#39;fuck willpower&#39;. <br />
<br />
Matthias, tan and lean, gently turned him around and played with Hugo&#39;s belt, teasing as he licked Hugo&#39;s lips. Hugo held back a groan, both panicking and relaxing at the idea of getting serviced by a human. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to react as Matthias dropped down his knees and muzzled his very hard dick. <br />
<br />
Matthias&#39; blonde head was so pretty from above, as it weaved around his dick. Hugo bit down on a groan as the tongue stopped teasing him and pulled him inside a very warm and wet mouth. <br />
<br />
After weeks of pent-up work with little occasion to release, Hugo did not last long. He came in rapid burst of seed that plastered the back of Matthias&#39; mouth, and folding him half over him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a nice guy. Nobody&#39;s that nice.&quot; he told Matthias, pulling a few strands of hair away his glazed over green eyes, &quot;you want something, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dick,&quot; he panted, leaning against Hugo&#39;s tights, &quot;it&#39;s like my dick is on fire. My balls... So full. I want... I want more... cock... I want more of that... nothing but that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Hugo said gently, before activating the camera. <br />
<br />
He leaned down and fished out the beautiful eight inch cock out of Matthias&#39; clothing. Poor guy was still rock hard, curving straight up, foreskin pulled back over a dripping dickhead that was red and swelling.<br />
<br />
Now, this cock, he would keep to himself. <br />
<br />
Hugo aligned Matthias with his own dick and pressed them together, enough to feel the sensation of want and longing return to his groin. In a matter of seconds, the afterglow of Matthias&#39; blowjob faded in the face of overwhelming desire. Though this one carried even more sensation to dick people. To reduce men to their dicks and make them see the light (out of a boxer&#39;s front opening). <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Hugo!&quot; Someone called out, naked as the day they were born and clinging to two men grinding on the table. &quot;Dick the three of us right as we come, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo grinned and gave Matthias a thug. &quot;Deal.&quot; <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;Truth or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo stopped by the guys around the pool, playing in loose shorts, or naked. They didn&#39;t notice him right away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Truth,&quot; replied Dylan, &quot;I don&#39;t trust your drunk ass to dare me, Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh, leaned back in the long chair, spreading his legs to give everyone a good view of his seven inch flaccid cock, and met Hugo&#39;s gaze over Dylan&#39;s head. &quot;Fine, coward. Would you like to be dicked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan blushed hard enough that his ears turned red. He ducked his head a bit as the people sitting by the pool laughed and dared him to answer. &#39;The Truth, Dylan!&#39; &#39;Come on, admit it!&#39;<br />
<br />
Dylan grit his teeth and downed the rest of his beer. &quot;Fuck it. Yes. Yes, I think it&#39;d be hot as fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next moment, Dylan landed atop his swimming trunks in all his nine inches glory. Globs of pre spurted out of his slit. <br />
<br />
Josh laughed and pointed to some other guy. &quot;Guess that means he skips his turn. Go ahead, Tyler.&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The game of Never have I ever ended much the same way. <br />
<br />
The dozen or so guys around the table swayed, cups on punch nearly empty or full, depending on how thirsty they felt. It was Victor&#39;s turn, and the man was completely shitfaced. Barely could string a sentence together and had, at some point, lost his clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Never... ever... have I...&quot; Victor blinked a couple of times, then struggled for something to say. &quot;ever have I... never... I... Never have I wanted to know what it was like to be my own cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire game party took a swing. So Hugo dicked the whole group in one go, except Victor who was laughing in tears as he lied head first against the table.  Of course, Hugo&#39;s computer detected that had been a lie designed the win the game, so Hugo decided to take punishing the cheater in his own hands. After all, a five inch penis fit well in one&#39;s grip. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Hugo walked up the stairs, readjusting his duffle bag on his shoulder. It was heavy with the amount of dicks he had acquired tonight. Of the hundred guys invited to the party, he must have dicked a good sixty. If he had not managed to attach and distribute  a bunch of them to the few still human partygoers, he would have had to do two trips back to his lab. As it was, he could simply afford to leave a handful of them lying amongst the clothes and empty beer bottles strawn throughout the frat house. <br />
<br />
However, as he got to the first floor, he heard grunting and panting. Honestly? There were still men conscious in this frat house? Or maybe they&#39;d woken up after an earlier round and still hadn&#39;t been completely sated. He rounded around the corner only to come face to face with familiar men.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The President can&#39;t speak at the moment,&quot; Hal said, grinning as he rammed into Ryan&#39;s ass. <br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s gaze was unfocused, his mouth open as he attempted to match Hal&#39;s rhythm. Under him, his dick bobbed back and forth, dripping on the bedsheet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me...&quot; Hal huffed, still thrusting, &quot;explain... ah, the pre... the prez, wanted to...&quot; - his hips slammed harder and Hal&#39;s eyes threatened to roll back into his head. - &quot;fuck, ah, yes, he wanted to fuck, and get dicked. Tired... Tired of being responsible for so many horndogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan only moaned. No verbal confirmation. Or even a sign that he had heard Hal&#39;s words. <br />
<br />
Hugo pondered. Was this Hal being vindictive? Forcing Ryan into dickhood? Though, he couldn&#39;t truly denounce the method as he himself had used sexual gratification as a method of coercion and as an incitative. Besides, he had never tried dicking someone that was having sex. Surely, it would yield new data if only on perspective.<br />
<br />
He lost sight of the fucking couple through the flash of his camera. He blinked away the spots in his sight just in time to see Hal shout as he shot strings of cum out of his new and improved dick all over himself. Ryan was nowhere to be seen. <br />
<br />
Hal dropped down on the bed, boneless and panting. His eyes were glazed over from leftover lust, and his much bigger cock was still oozing cum in a puddle as large as a dinner plate.<br />
<br />
Hugo tilted his head, thinking. How curious. He had expected both of them to be dicked with such close proximity between them. Not for only Ryan to become a penis. <br />
<br />
Under Hal&#39;s satisfied gaze, Hugo knelt down and ran a hand over Ryan. His fingers tickled the underside of his balls, then gently pulled on the shaft. Ten inches. Longer than either Ryan AND Hal. A short tug did nothing but make Hal moan quietly. In normal circumstances, a dicked man could be pulled off from someone, unless they were stitched there with homan tech. In this case, the cock remained firmly attached without any outside help. <br />
<br />
He needed to find out how this had happened. With a few clicks here and there, his computer began scanning Ryan&#39;s new dick form.</p>
