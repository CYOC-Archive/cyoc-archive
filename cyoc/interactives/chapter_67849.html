<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The “Dream Come True” ride was a boat ride similar to a love canal. Josh and Tom got into one boat together, seemingly oblivious to Ashley as they kept sneaking peaks at each others' bodies. Feeling a bit jealous and left out, Ashley got into the next boat alone.<br />
<br />
As they drifted along a dark tunnel, they heard pleasant music and saw lighted murals on the walls up ahead depicting smiling people. One showed a muscular man showing off in front of pretty girls. Another one showed a woman with a curvy figure being ogled by cute guys. There was a mural depicting a very tall boy shooting a basketball over other shorter boys, as well as a mural showing a skinny girl walking past a group of chubby girls who stare at her with envy.<br />
<br />
After seeing pictures of happy couples in the murals, Josh and Tom smiled and looked at each other. They both knew what their dream was at that moment.<br />
<br />
Ashley thought about the mural with the curvy woman. If only she could be a bit sexier than the other two…<br />
<br />
The ride took a turn and suddenly accelerated down a hill through a tunnel of flashing lights. The rushing wind and dazzling lights gave the moment a dreamlike surrealism. Josh and Tom held each other closely, while Ashley just held on to the boat. As their adrenaline pumped, all three felt their bodies tingle, and then the tunnel ended. Their boats drifted lazily to the end of the ride.<br />
<br />
Josh and Tom were the first to emerge from the ride. Tom stepped out of the boat, and then he turned to offer a hand to Josh. Josh smiled and said, “Thank you,” as Tom pulled her up out of the boat. The two women stood together next to the boats still holding hands and smiling at each other.<br />
<br />
Tom started to say something but then stopped and blushed.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” Josh asked, looking concerned.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” said Tom. “It’s silly.”<br />
<br />
“Come on. Tell me,” she said, smiling reassuringly.<br />
<br />
Tom swallowed and said, “I was just going to say you look… eh…”<br />
<br />
“Yes?”<br />
<br />
“You look very pretty in this light,” she said and then blushed a deeper red.<br />
<br />
Josh blushed in response. “Thank you,” she said. “You’re not so bad looking yourself.”<br />
<br />
For a second, their eyes met and all hesitation disappeared. They hugged each other warmly, pressing their breasts together, feeling the warmth of their mutual affection. Then, both of them leaned in, closed their eyes, and kissed each other gently.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” said a voice next to them. They separated but still held hands as they turned to see a gorgeous and very busty woman standing next to them. She looked shocked.<br />
<br />
“Ashley?” asked a stunned Josh as she recognized her transformed friend.<br />
<br />
Ashley had wanted to have a better body than the other two, and now she had it. Her white camisole top was stretched tightly over a pair of E-cup boobs, displaying a line of cleavage that outshone Tom’s chest. She was older and taller now as well, standing at least a couple of inches taller than Josh. Bellow her bare midriff, which showed off her skinny waist, her broad hips and tight round ass were wrapped in a pair of skinny denim jeans, which hugged her tightly all the way down her long, luscious legs.<br />
<br />
“What are you two doing?” Ashley asked, but they were too stunned to respond. Her voice had a noticeably breathier tone, which matched her sexy face. She still resembled her old self, but everything about her appearance seemed to have been enhanced. Her lips were plumper. Her cheekbones more prominent. Her eyelashes thicker and longer. Even her hair seemed more lustrous and curvy.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, she was the most beautiful and alluring woman that any of them had ever seen. Movie stars and porn stars had nothing on her.<br />
<br />
“You look amazing,” said Tom.<br />
<br />
Ashley looked down at herself. Her eyes went wide as she saw her breasts. She looked around at the rest of her body, amazed by her own curves.<br />
<br />
Josh grabbed her hand and led her to the exit of the ride. “Come on, Ash,” she said. “Let’s go take a seat somewhere to take all of this in.” Ashley followed along, still reeling from her changes.<br />
<br />
The three of them sat on a bench, Josh and Tom sat together holding hands as they watched Ashley. She felt the weight of her boobs in her hands briefly, not caring who was watching her. Indeed, her new looks were turning the heads of guys that walked by. “Amazing,” she said. “They weren’t kidding about a ‘Dream Come True.’” Eventually, Ashley looked away from herself and noticed her friends holding hands tenderly.<br />
<br />
“So,” she said, not really sure where to begin. “Did I really just see the two of you kiss?”<br />
<br />
The two women blushed. “Well,” said Tom. “Yeah, I guess we did.”<br />
<br />
“But,” Ashley said, still having trouble processing all of the new information coming at her. “You’re… I mean, well, you’re… into each other now?”<br />
<br />
Josh laughed nervously and said, “I guess so. I mean, I thought that Tom had a smoking hot body and all.”<br />
<br />
“Not as hot as yours,” interrupted Tom, who squeezed her hand affectionately.<br />
<br />
“…But I was kind of weirded out by that,” continued Josh, “since he… she was my bud, but then…”<br />
<br />
Tom continued for her, “…but then, on the ride, I think we both realized what we wanted. We wanted to have each other. At least, I know wanted Josh.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I wanted you too,” Josh said. “So, I wished I could have you, and now I don’t care at all who we used to be. It’s weird but really nice. It’s like a weight has been lifted from me. I feel so free now. I just love you.”<br />
<br />
“I love you too,” said Tom and then the two kissed again and giggled.<br />
<br />
Ashley blushed and smiled as well. “Well,” she said. “I guess we all had our dreams come true after all.”<br />
<br />
Ashley noticed a few guys slow down to stare at her breasts. It made her uncomfortable. Then, another guy looked like he wanted to walk up to her and say something, but he just took one step toward her and then turned to walk away. Apparently, his courage had run out when he realized that she was out of his league.<br />
<br />
Josh and Tom stood up together. “Come on, Ash,” said Josh. “Let’s see what else we can find in this park. I feel like another adventure.”<br />
<br />
Ashley stood up to join them, stretching to her full 6’ tall. One guy near them literally gasped. Ashley noticed now that a small crowd of guys had begun to form around her, all of them staring at her body. Their lust-filled faces and the bulges in their crotches clearly said that they wanted her, but none of them approached her. They just stood in a circle around her, keeping their distance. Some even took a step back when she stood up.<br />
<br />
They were all scared, she realized. She was so pretty and sexy now that guys were too intimidated by her looks to even approach her.<br />
<br />
Part of Ashley relished this new power. She could probably get guys to do just about anything for her now, she figured. She could be the most popular girl around. Hell, she could be a model or a movie star. She could have anything she ever wanted. Another part of her worried about her future with guys. If she was so beautiful that most guys were afraid to even approach her, then would she ever be able to get a regular guy to go out with her? Would she have to settle for some narcissistic jerk who believed that he deserved the world’s most beautiful woman? She felt very exposed and very alone all of the sudden. She wished that she had a parka to drape over her body or at least a pair of sunglasses. Maybe this wasn’t such a dream come true after all.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go, Ash,” said Tom.<br />
<br />
Ashley followed as her two friends lead the way. Every guy there stared at her and every guy stepped aside as she passed to give her space, like she had a guy repulsing magnet on her. Her beauty was so captivating that she even managed to distract the guys from the cute lesbian couple in front of her. “Wow,” she heard one teen boy exclaim. When Ashley turned to look at him, he blushed and literally ran off.<br />
<br />
Feeling a bit frantic now, she said to Tom and Josh, “Guys, could we go somewhere a little less public? I feel like a bug under a microscope here.”<br />
<br />
Tom and Josh had been so enamored with each other that they hadn’t even noticed the small crowd of guys that had formed a circle around them to stare at Ashley. Seeing the crowd now, Tom and Josh realized that Ashley must be overwhelmed by all of the attention.<br />
<br />
“Right,” said Josh as she and Tom searched for somewhere to hide Ashley.<br />
<br />
Tom noticed a sign next to them and said, “Hey, let’s go in there.” She pointed to the sign. “We could probably hide out there for a little while.”<br />
<br />
The sign read…</p>
