<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derek grinned broadly and said, &quot;I knew you switched the bottles.  I just played along that I'd been drugged, <br />
while waiting for the immobilizing formula to take effect. Any moment now, you will topple over as stiff as a <br />
board.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Derek, I know you switched the bottles back when I you had me look through the microscope to see how you <br />
wove your nanite thread in with the Spandex. I just waited for the opportunity, and switched the straws, so <br />
you drank the bottle you drugged. Feeling stiff yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, cr-&quot; said Derek as he became rigid and toppled into Dirk's waiting arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it sucks to be you right now. Let's see I'm keeping Jimmy as my jockstrap, and I think you'll make a <br />
fine left sock,&quot; Dirk said helping Derek out of his undies and on to the left side of the table.  He quickly <br />
catheterized Derek, and strapped him firmly to the table. He raised Derek's head up pulling the hair away from <br />
the nape of his neck, and positioned the neurolink cable plug at the base of his brain.  As soon as one of the <br />
wire fibers nicked Derek's neck, the whole cord came to life and leaped out of Dirk's hand to bury its <br />
multiplicity of fangs in Derek's brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, so this snake is eager to bite its maker. Oh, so Biblical,&quot; laughed Dirk, &quot;Now to get the rest of <br />
you hooked up.  Let's see, you said the bag attached to your rectum next, and then the TENS wires to the <br />
muscles. I'll just copy the arrangement of them on Jimmy.  Then, I need a right sock. Hm, I think I know the <br />
perfect guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Dirk had finished attaching the plastic bag through the hole under the table, he took out his cell phone.  <br />
He looked up a number and dialed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, is Brody there?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Brody, you helped me get fitted for a suit yesterday.  Turns out I need it tonight. Do you think you <br />
could get it finished up and deliver it to me tonight?  There's an extra hundred dollars in it if you can <br />
bring it to me,&quot; Dirk said with a fiendish gleam in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure, I'll bring it personally to your home, as soon as I get off work at 5 pm.  You do want it delivered <br />
to your home address?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, actually, I'd like you to bring it to,&quot; Dirk paused to read the lab address he had jotted down when Derek <br />
had called him earlier. &quot;And use the outside basement stairs, there's a doorbell next to the basement door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I should be there by 5:30,&quot; Brody answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; said Dirk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The machine whirred to life as Derek was linked to the left white sock.  All the wires had been connected, all <br />
the tubes were in place, his body was on the same life support system as James Standish, and his life as <br />
Dirk's left sock had just begun.<br />
<br />
He screamed mentally as Dirk wriggled his sweaty toes inside Derek. He couldn't believe that he had gotten <br />
suckered into this situation.  He was also shocked that the &quot;dumb jock&quot; Dirk was smart enough to properly hook <br />
Derek up to his own machine. He couldn't believe how effective his machine was - Dirk's disgusting foot odor <br />
permeated every sense of Derek's being. He could feel the subtle whorls on the soles of his foot and toes. The <br />
athlete's foot fungus and the residue of anti-fungal powder also seemed pungent and offensive to Derek.  This <br />
was his life now - he was Dirk's sock. He felt so depressed.<br />
<br />
Less than 15 minutes after he put on the socks, Dirk heard the bell ring. He dashed to the door. The pain of <br />
the big oaf's weight pressing down on Derek with such force had an odd effect on Derek.  It was like someone <br />
squeezing his cock hard. He orgasmed. Then he recalled something Dirk had mentioned casually.  The bastard <br />
usually ran at least 5 miles a day. Such pain and pleasure would undoubtedly quickly reduce Derek into a total <br />
masochist. He was terrified, and also somewhat eager.  It hurt, but oh, it hurt so good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh!&quot; Brody gasped with his mouth hanging wide open. <br />
<br />
Dirk had opened the door wearing only white socks and a jockstrap.<br />
<br />
Dirk picked up the conversation by saying, &quot;Good, you're here, Brody. You've got the suit?  Come on in. I need <br />
to get dressed ASAP.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you really are in a hurry,&quot; Brody said stepping through the doorway and gathering his composure. He hoped <br />
that his baggy trousers had revealed the outline of his boner when he saw nearly naked Dirk's muscular body <br />
framed by the doorway.<br />
<br />
Dirk closed the door, and handed Brody an open beer with a crisp new $100 bill wrapped around the outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a drink, and stick around, will you?  I want to make sure this looks right on me before I go to my <br />
party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Thanks,&quot; Brody said in a distant voice.  He was staring at the two naked guys on the table hooked up to <br />
life support.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't worry about those guys, Brody, they're participating in an experiment for NASA's suspended <br />
animation program. Did you know it takes over 2 years for a spacecraft to reach Mars?  The guy on the right <br />
started out clean-shaven like the man on the left, but he's been like this for over 2 months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow? Uh, I didn't think you were a science major?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, but I earn extra money working for scientists.  I empty the catheter bags, and excrement bags, and bathe <br />
the subjects when needed.  The professor is working on automating those jobs, but right now he wants a hands <br />
on approach to make sure the subjects remain healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and I thought my job sucked,&quot; Brody blurted out, &quot;That's as bad as my summer job changing adult diapers <br />
at the nursing home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, probably worse.  I have to give them periodic enemas too. And soon there will be three guys lying on <br />
that table,&quot; Dirk said as he pulled up his newly tailored trousers.<br />
<br />
Brody wiped his brow.  He felt flushed-hot and sweaty.  He glanced at the half-empty beer bottle and yawned. <br />
Dirk positioned himself to catch Brody when he fell.  The guy wasn't nearly as big as Derek had been, but he <br />
was in good shape. Dirk stripped Brody and lay him on the right side of Jimmy.<br />
<br />
When he hooked up the neurolink cable to Brody, he was still wearing both socks.  Brody suddenly overwhelmed <br />
with sensations, as he woke from total darkness to find himself wrapped around a giant stinking foot. He <br />
realized that one of those other guys had to be Dirk's other sock. Dirk stripped out of his suit, and grabbed <br />
an outfit from his gym bag.  He tied the Derek's lab key around his neck, and put his shoes on. He decided to <br />
break in his new socks with a ten mile jog. <br />
<br />
In a matter of moments, Brody found himself totally on edge. He was also a victim of pleasure and pain. He was <br />
soon on edge, then he was orgasming just like Derek was.  He wondered whether he was cumming into the catheter <br />
or whether his sexual ecstasy and horrible crushing pains were just in his head or if he was physically being <br />
effective.</p>
