<br />
As Nate Anderson started driving home from Spencer Lawson&#39;s house, his younger brother Eric said, &quot;I feel like such a fool!&quot;<br />
&quot;Want to talk about it?&quot; asked Nate sympathetically.<br />
&quot;I knew Julie was after me, but I still let her get the drop on me. If she had scratched me while she was messing with my cock...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, just between us, I&#39;ve always known that you&#39;re the brains and I&#39;m the brawn of this outfit,&quot; said Nate, trying to bolster his brother&#39;s confidence. &quot;Besides, if I was in your shoes and was looking at something involving werewolves...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Moon Lake is so much different than Minnesota,&quot; replied Eric, stating the obvious, while shifting in his seat to attempt being more comfortable, for &quot;Little&quot; Eric was still sore after Julie Stovall&#39;s attack. &quot;But at least we might not have to worry about her for a while.&quot;<br />
&quot;OH?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Seems the mayor&#39;s office contacted Mister Lawson to help out with something, and part of the package deal is for Mister Stovall to call off his daughter against me and Spencer. Not saying we&#39;ll have peace forever, knowing that bitch, but at least it should buy us a little breathing room for awhile.&quot;<br />
&quot;I still don&#39;t understand what Julie&#39;s problem with you and Spencer is anyway,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
&quot;Other than the fact that we&#39;re together, and somehow Julie&#39;s cheating ways after I dumped her got her grounded for at least the rest of this year, your guess is as good as mine,&quot; agreed Eric.<br />
Then the Anderson brothers remained silent until their house was in sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still not sure what to tell mom and dad if they see me limping,&quot; revealed Eric, noticing their mom&#39;s car was already in the driveway as they arrived, &quot;but before we go in, can we talk?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Nate, after parking behind his mom&#39;s vehicle.<br />
With the car completely stopped and off, Nate undid his seat belt and turned to look at his younger brother as Eric asked, &quot;Your first time, did it hurt?&quot;<br />
&quot;My first time what?&quot; asked Nate in return. &quot;Losing my virginity or becoming a were?&quot; As a werewolf, he could smell Eric was still both a normal human being and a virgin. At least for now.<br />
&quot;Both.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... mom and dad don&#39;t know I lost my virginity BEFORE we left Minnesota, instead of when I became a werewolf. But it&#39;s more a question of nervousness than anything physical for guys, compared to what girls go through with the hymen issue and all.&quot;<br />
&quot;I had sex ed, and there&#39;s plenty of stuff on the Internet, but can you be more specific?&quot;<br />
&quot;Am I doing this right? Should I be doing something different so she enjoys it more and is not in much pain if this her first time too? Stuff like that. Even for guys, it can get kind of complicated,&quot; admitted Nate. &quot;But physically, it&#39;s highly enjoyable.&quot;<br />
&quot;And transforming?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;The very first time is the most difficult, since your body is experiencing a whole new set of changes, drastically different from even what puberty brings and at a much quicker rate. Which is why normals are usually inducted into were society via sex. Every time after that is much easier, and highly enjoyable in its own way. It&#39;s a rush that I can&#39;t quite explain as accurately as I should, but once you&#39;ve done it a couple of times yourself, you&#39;ll understand it better.&quot; Nate wanted to ask why Eric&#39;s curiosity was piqued again, but waited until his brother answered the question himself.<br />
&quot;Ever since Spencer and I fell in love, we&#39;ve been talking about the fact that I&#39;m not a were yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, considering this is Moon Lake, if you&#39;re in love with a were, if you ever want to be fully intimate with her...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Our discussions have concluded in Spencer agreeing with me that the best compatible were to her hybrid form would be a werepanther. That way, I&#39;d be able to keep up with Spencer&#39;s speed and climb trees just like her, but trying to find a werepanthRESS to help us out has always been a problem. Until now,&quot; revealed Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Nate, afraid they were going to ask him to involve Kenya Adaeze, and considering the status of his relationship with her at the moment...<br />
&quot;Turns out Frieda Knight is a werepanthress, and is willing to help us, for a price.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot;<br />
&quot;Frieda&#39;s bi like mom, and wants a night with Spencer first before she changes me,&quot; announced Eric.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Nate in disbelief. &quot;And is Spencer willing to give Frieda what she wants?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. After all, there is some werecat on her mother&#39;s side in that hybrid form of hers, so Spencer has no problem <i>tasting honey from time to time</i> as she puts it.&quot;<br />
&quot;So Spencer might want to have an open relationship with you just like mom and dad have with each other,&quot; realized Nate.<br />
&quot;At least between me, her, and Frieda,&quot; confirmed Eric.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be surprised if it eventually opens beyond Frieda,&quot; advised Nate. &quot;But are you going to be cool with this?&quot;<br />
&quot;We talked before I called you for a ride. We love each other. She has no problem with me being straight, and I have no problem with her wanting to <i>taste honey</i> once in a while, so we&#39;re probably going to end up like mom and dad. Spencer and I will share women, but I&#39;ll be the only guy in her life.&quot;<br />
&quot;What if she wants another guy from time to time?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;She says I&#39;m the only one, but if that&#39;s something we might wind up discussing again someday...&quot; began Eric, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;After all, we both know dad&#39;s had women without mom present, and that&#39;s never bothered her, despite the fact dad&#39;s the only guy she&#39;s ever had. Although now that you&#39;ve raised the issue, I can&#39;t help wondering if Spencer gets to have fun with other guys, do I get to have sex with other women? We only talked about her and women.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate thought about it for a moment before saying, &quot;You mean like during orgies and those swingers&#39; parties our folks attend sometimes? Granted, were&#39;s don&#39;t have to worry about a lot of stuff medically like sexually transmitted diseases, but you better ask Spencer first. Besides, becoming a were, regardless of why, is a mighty big step. Are you ready for it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I love her Nate,&quot; replied Eric without a moment&#39;s hesitation. &quot;I may not have realized it the exact moment I grabbed Ben&#39;s baseball bat and ran off into the woods in that attempt to save her from Jeremy Bower, Junior; but if I wasn&#39;t already in love with Spencer then, I certainly am now. And to totally be with her...&quot;<br />
Then Eric paused before adding, &quot;Besides, a werepanther is also logistically the best possible were to be in this part of the country, next to werewolves. So while I can&#39;t see things not working out with Spencer, at least I&#39;ll still fit in.&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought you were over the fitting in hang up since we moved here,&quot; commented Nate.<br />
&quot;I thought I was too until today when Julie showed me how vulnerable I still am as a normal. When I change, I want it to be the form I want, not that twisted were-mermaid&#39;s choice. Besides, you and our parents seem much happier since you all gained fursonas.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t deny that,&quot; agreed Nate. <i>Except for my problems with Kenya.</i> &quot;Now then, we better go on in, because I&#39;m surprised one of them hasn&#39;t come out here wondering if everything is all right,&quot; he added, starting to get out of the car.<br />
<br />
But as the Anderson brothers entered the house, they quickly understood why they hadn&#39;t seen either one of their parents yet.<br />
&quot;OOOHHH...&quot; moaned Martha Anderson from behind the closed door of their father&#39;s study. &quot;That&#39;s it my sexy fox. Harder! Faster! Deeper!&quot;<br />
&quot;Y-YES!&quot; agreed William Anderson, as they heard the rhythmic pounding of a vulpine couple having sex.<br />
&quot;You better sneak upstairs while you can,&quot; Nate whispered in Eric&#39;s ear. &quot;I&#39;ll stay down here and wait until you&#39;ve made it, just in case.&quot;<br />
Eric just smiled in agreement as he started to limp to the stairs, his penis still sore from Julie Stovall&#39;s earlier attack, which is why he was still walking funny.<br />
<br />
Nate waited until after Eric disappeared upstairs before he texted Spencer Lawson on his cellphone.<br />
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH ERIC BECOMING A WERE. HE TRULY LOVES U. BUT FEAR OF JULIE IS STILL BUGGING HIM, SO PLEASE MAKE SURE HIS HEAD IS ON STRAIGHT & ERIC KNOWS THE FULL DETAILS OF WHAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP U 2 WILL HAVE BEFORE HE DOES.</p>
