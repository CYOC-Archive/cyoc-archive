<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That&#39;s when Stacy nearly began to whimper. She could not belive that Chelsea would do something like that. Especially to her of all people. They hadd been besties for as long as she could remember. <br />
<br />
She rememberd meeting in kindergarden and playing house together. She remember them telling eachother about thire secret crushes. She remember Chelsea deffending her when kids at school hadd made fun of her by calling her a bimbo because she started growing breasts at an early age. She rememberd trying out for the cheer team together with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t belive Chelsea would do this to me. We have allways been there for eachother. We have allways been besties.&quot; Stacy said to herself in disbelief. She felt a little weird again for a second. As the feeling passed Stacy was still trying to prosses what was going on. She just could not belive that Chelsea would do something like this to her. Or could she? The more Stacy thought about it, the more Stacy could belive that Chelsea would do something like this to her.<br />
<br />
Stacy got the urge to leave. She did not want Chelsea to spot her. So with her heart in her throat Stacy quickly turned tail and ran for the parking lot. Well, she ran for a littel bit before she was out of breath again. <br />
<br />
As Stacy walked the rest of the way towards the praking lot, she tryed to prosses what hadd just happend to her. And why did she all of the sudden loathe Chelsea? <br />
<br />
Stacy knew for a fact that she hadd rememberd Chelsea as her closest friend just a few minutes ago. But now, all she could remember about Chelsea was that she hadd allways been a bitch and bully, whom had it out for Stacy in particular.<br />
<br />
Stacy still rememberd her self as the popular queen b of the school and captain of the cheer team. She remembed her old life, her true life. But in all her memorys regarding Chelsea so was Stacy this new dorky looser vertion of herself.<br />
<br />
She rememberd Chelsea never wanting to play with her in kindergarden, allways making the other girls choose between them. She rememberd Chelsea telling everyone about Stacy seacred crush as a kid. She rememberd Chelsea makeing fun of her glasses. She rememberd Chelsea telling her that she looked like a cow when she started growing breasts at an early age. She rememberd Chelsea starting nasty rumors about her and teasing her for being inn the chess club.<br />
<br />
Stacy started to freak out as the idea of whatever happened to her, might start to innfect her mind too. <br />
Was she having an nightmare, was she going mad, what was going on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Stacy, wait up!&quot; Stacy jumped at the sound of the voice, spinning to look behind her, and groaning when she spotet Eliot Freeman walking towards her.<br />
<br />
Standing 7&#39; 4&quot; tall, Eliot was an gentle giant, but he usually hunched around so he didn&#39;t look as tall as he really was. He hadd dark skin and was also very lanky, with thin arms and skinny legs. A particularly notable feature of his is his malocclusion (&quot;bucktooth&quot;). He was also an annoying dork whom hadd had a crush on Stacy since they were in middle school. Normaly he was too shy to talk to her tho.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we both are running a littel late for the chess club, eh Stacy.&quot; Eliot said in an excited manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to the chess club, I don’t want to go the chess club, infact so is the chess club the last place I wanna go right now.&quot; sneered Stacy back at him. As she did she felt a little weird again for a second. And she suddenly got the urge to attend the chess club. She felt like a good game of chess surounded by familar faces, would be the perfect thing to cheer her up and calme her nerves right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no worries. We aren&#39;t that late Stacy. No need to stress about it.&quot; chuckled Eliot.<br />
<br />
Stacy let out a sigh of relief <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I might not be the first one there but...&quot; Stacy stopped mid-sentence, why the hell did she suddenly want to go to the fucking chess club, whatever was happenening was toying with her mind again! She felt a little weird again for a second. And suddenly she was standing inside an empty class room.<br />
<br />
Stacy was in disbelief, did she just have a stroke or hadd she been teleported right now. With all that hadd happened she wasn&#39;t sure one way or the other.<br />
<br />
She got snaped out of her daze when her cell rung. She pulled it out and awnserd it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Stacy, its mom. I don’t want to bother you baby, but I have hadd an terrible day today. First I got a parking ticket, then I had to clean out the break station at work, AND now I have a work meeting that I am totally unprepared for. And I don&#39;t think I can handel anymore surprises today. So I just want to remind you that you promised to pick up your little brother Jim at band practice on your way home from Chess club today, so watch the time okey, no last minute matches unless your preperd to forfeit the match. Anyway I got to hurry baby, so have a nice day at Chess club and call me back later.&quot;&quot; She rambeld on as Stacy hadd the most unsettling case of déjà vu. &quot;Oh! Don&#39;t forget to walk Ruby too. Ok bye now, love you.&quot; She added before she hung up.<br />
<br />
There was no way! Stacy looked at the Clock at her phone see if she was crazy or not. But sure enuff the clock was back about ten minuts. Hadd she just traveled back in time? But how was that even possible?</p>
