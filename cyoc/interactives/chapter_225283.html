<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James finished the call before he hung up the phone with a sigh. He never knew how busy being a CEO was. And although a small part of him enjoyed the power and the role of being a man at the very top, giving out defiant orders to his submissive employees; he still missed the simple easy life of an intern.<br />
<br />
James walked back to the room to see Vince all dressed up and posing in front of the mirror. “Hey Miles! How do I look?” Vince said, spotting James in the mirror’s reflection.<br />
<br />
“I must admit… you look pretty good.” James said, admiring how much more handsome Vince looked in a suit. In fact, it reaffirmed the whole reason he invited Vince in the first place as he felt his massive cock begin to throb. This body craved sex and James wasn’t sure he could wait another second.<br />
<br />
“Wanna try it with our clothes on?” Vince said with a cheeky smile as he turned around and revealed a likewise impressive bulge in his dress pants.<br />
<br />
James made his way forward to Vince, almost unable to control himself when he noticed a slight shimmer from Vince’s hand. Upon closer look, James recognized it as… the magic ring!<br />
<br />
What the- How had Vince gained accessed to it? He was pretty sure Miles had hid it right after they swapped. James could only assume Vince must have accidentally found it when rummaging through Miles’ belongings.<br />
<br />
“Hey? Why’d you stop?” Vince asked confused, as he noticed James halt a few feet away from him.<br />
<br />
This was bad! Vince had the magic ring and if James wasn’t careful he could end up swapping with Vince or worse lose the ring. He had to be careful… after all the ring was the only thing capable of swapping James and Miles back to their original bodies.<br />
<br />
“I… uh… just realized that… I don’t want to do it with our clothes on.” James stammered as he tried to come up with an excuse.<br />
<br />
“Why not? I’m more than willing to try clothed sex… especially on someone like you.” Vince said with a flirtatious wink.<br />
<br />
“God!” James thought as he felt his erection throb more from Vince’s wink. He wasn’t sure how much longer he could restrain himself from fucking Vince but he had to… control himself.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, James turned around to face away from James. “It’s just… there’s this sex move I want to try but I’m not sure I can do it with our clothes on.” James lied. “Why don’t we both just strip and have sex regularly?”<br />
<br />
“Sure… if that’s what you want.” Vince responded, but James could hear the slight disappointment in his voice. Afterwards the two of them took off all their clothing, with James making sure to see Vince take the ring off and place it back on the dresser before they began.<br />
<br />
James sat on the bed and motioned Vince to sit on his lap. Vince did and sat with his back away, and although it looked a bit awkward considering they were both large muscular men, James felt a little bad for Vince. “Sorry if I ruined your thrill,” James said as he place his large arms around Vince’s waist. “But I bet I can make it more than up to you.”<br />
<br />
Vince was a bit confused… why was Miles being so nice? He couldn’t remember the last time Miles had been so kind to him nor had he ever imagined him capable of apologizing. The last thing on his mind was the odd behavior Miles had just exhibited.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you lay on the bed while I give you a surprise” James said. Vince got off James lap and laid on his stomach on the bed, confused as to what Miles was envisioning. It didn’t take too long to figure out.<br />
<br />
“Miles? What are you planning to d-“ Vince began before being interrupted by a slick wet sensation enter his ass. Gripping the mattress with his fingers, he moaned as he felt James slowly place his tongue inside his ass.<br />
<br />
James realized that the least he could do for Vince was give him something James had alway wanted. James had never been given the opportunity to be eaten out in his old body and he assumed that it was something Vince probably never had the pleasure of considering he mostly topped with other men. But with Miles body, the two men were of equal stature, and James was easily able to top Vince.<br />
<br />
Vince moaned in ecstasy as he felt James continue to push further with his rough tongue. Never could he had imagined this from Miles. Every chance they met, Miles often just fucked Vince, usually without any lube and just raw. But this was the last thing he expected. Perhaps he had missed his first chance at try clothed sex but his first experience of being eaten out was more than enough to make up for it.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes James stopped and stood up. “Now I think you’re more than ready for the real reward,” James said with an alluring deep tone. Vince slowly crawled up as James quickly grabbed his wrists and pushed him towards himself.<br />
<br />
Surprised at the sudden notion, Vince was more than shocked when he immediately felt Miles large dick enter him. The preparation had worked as Vince’s wet hole easily accepted the large rod. Vince couldn’t keep himself from moaning as the big cock filled him up perfectly. One of the reasons Vince rarely bottomed was the lack of satisfactory dicks for his large size but Miles was more than enough for him.<br />
<br />
James grinned at the incredibly pleasure he felt from Vince’s tight hole, probably from lack of usage. He barely had any experience with topping but he knew enough from porn videos to help him through it. Including the position he was currently trying. James never had the opportunity or desire to really try this position but in Miles body it just felt natural. This large powerful body easily craved sex from a dominant top position and was easily enough able to get it.<br />
<br />
Vince felt himself in a uncharacteristically submissive position as James grabbed each of his wrists and kept him in position, turned away and unable to move, as James plowed his dick inside of him. Vince could only continue to moan in pleasure as James fucked the brains out of him. Losing himself to the pleasure, Vince could hardly even recall why he didn’t bottom more often.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Vince felt himself being let go as he fell on to the bed. As he tried to pick himself up  with his hands, he felt James grab each side of his waist as he reentered him. Vince stayed in position this time voluntarily as James continued to fuck him. The sounds of moans and sex quickly filling the room once again.<br />
<br />
James craved more and fast and realized he had to change positions. He let Vince go to give him a sudden false sense of relief before fucking him again. James found it odd how easily being a dominant top came to him as if it was second nature but he could only assume it came from being in Miles body. But James didn’t question it any further as his only goal at the moment was reaching the most pleasure possible with his current bottom.<br />
<br />
After a bit, it was becoming apparent that neither could hold it for much longer as they both bellowed deep moans as they cummed simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Vince felt himself being filled up nicely with a large load of cum as it slowly dripped out as James pulled his cum covered cock out. The semen fell over the bedsheets as the two fell on to the bed side by side. Tired and exhausted they both drifted off…</p>
