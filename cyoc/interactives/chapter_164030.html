<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sadly it&#39;s been a while since my last visit/post. Working in retail based warehousing has always been a rough gig, but during this {censored} pandemic it&#39;s worse than doing so during Back to School and Christmas combined!—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John Harper sat silently in the back seat of his new brother-in-law&#39;s car as Harry Jenkins drove.<br />
Jenny Harper-Jenkins sat in the passenger seat across from her husband. Both had their concerns about the young lad, but until they had time to talk things over between the two of them, let alone the rest of the family...<br />
John started looking around as they approached the Jenkins house in Moon Lake. They had passed a few students walking on their way home from school and the adults knew what—or more precisely, who—John was looking for.<br />
But no one saw any sign of a certain red haired lass as the car pulled into the driveway.<br />
As Harry parked, John quickly got out and took a position on the sidewalk.<br />
&quot;Would you like to come in for a snack or something?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
&quot;No thank you. Perhaps later,&quot; her younger brother replied.<br />
With that Harry affectionately put his arm around Jenny and escorted her inside.<br />
<br />
It was about five minutes later before John saw her.<br />
He waved and smiled as he saw Ginger O&#39;Toole quicken her pace upon realizing he was there.<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; she said, coming closer.<br />
&quot;Hey yourself,&quot; John replied. Then, as if following the script of some romantic comedy, both of them said &quot;Can we talk?&quot; in unison.<br />
John just smiled at the gaffe as Ginger asked where.<br />
He didn&#39;t want to sit on the Jenkins&#39; front porch this time, despite it being technically &quot;their&quot; spot, so opted for sitting under a tree in the next door neighbor&#39;s front yard.<br />
John was polite enough to ask how Ginger&#39;s school day went first and responded to some of her commentary.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe but I have no idea whether it&#39;s good or bad to intentionally expose were society now. I do agree that it is good to have a plan to do so on our terms and keep people from getting the wrong idea about us, but as to when to actually use it?&quot; to which John just simply shrugged his shoulders to indicate uncertainty and doubt.<br />
Ginger&#39;s spirits increased at his specific choice of words, for John was still a normal human being and not a were. Yet.<br />
But when, let alone what and who would have the honor of initiating him was part of what was bothering her friend, so Ginger tread lightly when she asked, &quot;Can you tell me how your meeting with Doctor Twist went?&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused to collect his thoughts once more before answering.<br />
&quot;Ever since the two of us first met, I won&#39;t deny feeling an... attraction to you. Especially after seeing you that night in your weretigress form when I took out the trash,&quot; he began, looking intently at the red haired, green eyed woman before him. &quot;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not interested in being your friend. It&#39;s just...&quot;<br />
And then he paused.<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re still trying to figure out a few key points in regards to who, let alone what you want to be in life. Even before you discovered the possible were options,&quot; Ginger replied. &quot;I do have some feelings for you too,&quot; she added, feeling her cheeks start to blush a bit. &quot;Even if nothing ever happens between us beyond a deep and lasting friendship, I just want you to know that I will always be here for you.&quot; <i>Although if we can be more...</i><br />
&quot;I appreciate that,&quot; John said with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s just that there has been so much running through my mind. I keep having these dreams. Lately more like nightmares.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean they&#39;ve changed since you first mentioned them to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, and not for the better,&quot; he admitted. &quot;At first it was just a question of by who&#39;s paw if I did join were society. The female option was always represented by you,&quot; John said, to which Ginger couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;Yet there was always this male weretiger available too.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you still don&#39;t know who that is or could be?&quot; she wondered.<br />
&quot;No. Despite where we are, I haven&#39;t met that many people that I know are actually weres yet, and you&#39;re the only tiger so far. Anyway, as the dreams went on, I went from being who I am now to becoming a weretiger, although I&#39;m still not certain who actually changed me, for I kept seeing different scenarios. Either me and you, me and him, or somehow the three of us together, however that works.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hear there are ways,&quot; Ginger said cautiously, &quot;but you said you were uncertain whether you were straight, gay, or bi. My mom says doubt and uncertainty are a natural part of life, although we were discussing something else then, because this was months before your sister Jenny moved here for college. Yet I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out and decide what&#39;s best for you in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; said John. &quot;But the dreams have gotten worse. Especially since this whole reveal issue started.&quot;<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Ginger asked, concerned for her friend.<br />
&quot;Whether it&#39;s me and you, me or whoever he is, or the three of us together, we&#39;re hunted by an angry mob. Usually with my father leading the charge. In one he even shot me, point blank and—&quot;<br />
With what little information she had about the Harper family indicating how overbearing and strict their parents are, Ginger reached out and hugged her friend.<br />
John just laid his weary head on her shoulder and started crying.<br />
Ginger just held him, her body shivering in both the closeness and the emotions running through her at the moment.<br />
In time the last of his tears had left, but John Harper didn&#39;t move. He enjoyed being in Ginger&#39;s arms. Feeling her warmth against him on an early November afternoon. The scent of her hair, let alone Ginger herself...<br />
<br />
As if by mutual agreement, they finally moved apart enough to stare at each other.<br />
Neither spoke, wondering if what was about to happen should, let alone would.<br />
John Harper and Ginger O&#39;Toole started to lean toward each other.<br />
They titled their heads slightly as their lips drew closer and—<br />
&quot;There you are John!&quot; his sister Janice called out, interrupting the moment.<br />
The two teenagers quickly pulled away from each other as John turned to stare at his younger sister. &quot;Did you need something Janice?&quot; he asked, trying to control his anger at the moment being spoiled.<br />
&quot;The grown ups sent me outside for some reason, and I didn&#39;t have anything else to do, so I thought I&#39;d look for you,&quot; she explained. If she knew what they were about to do that she prevented, Janice gave no indication of it.<br />
&quot;Well, I better be getting home. I&#39;ve got homework to do,&quot; Ginger said, standing up.<br />
<i>Great!</i> &quot;It was great having a chance to talk to you,&quot; John said, standing as well.<br />
&quot;Me too. I&#39;ll see you later,&quot; Ginger said, before leaning closer and whispering in his ear, &quot;Tomorrow is garbage pick up day.&quot;<br />
With his back to Janice, John smiled as he watched Ginger walk the rest of the way to her home, a few houses away from the Jenkins residence.</p>
