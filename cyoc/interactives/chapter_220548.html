<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Enoch’s head hit the pillow on the bed he was given; the wolf-taur was fast asleep. Exhausted from the long day he had; staring with collecting Baal and Alecto to find those that were kidnapped. Svadilfari joining after he dropped the young twins Fenrir and Hel off to family in the palace; the party was soon joined by Ahriman; Jahi Morningstar’s husband. With finding a condemned human soul along with Pallaca who became the Angel Lucy as wells as an amnesiac Jahi; the party was soon joined by the angel Metatron and Sandalphon.<br />
<br />
The battle was fierce. The chaos thralls that were their friends would not go down. Enoch had to make a tough choice; strike his brother Loki down or fall. It was a difficult choice, but for Enoch it ended up with him becoming an angel. The energies he unleashed upon his ascension expelled the chaos from those that were enthralled; those energies also provided a second miracle. That miracle was to repair the mutilation the enslaved thralls had to endure from the witches Heka and Qesem.<br />
<br />
His foray into the cave that Heka and Qesem called home along with Metaron and Father Patrick Brown acting as guide was to ensure that those foul rites could not be practiced again. Then his arrival in heaven was not without hiccups. Still his brass self; dripping with sarcasm to those that give him attitude, he did have to silently admit to himself that pushing Jehovah was not the wisest course, but it is Enoch’s way of coping with the situation. The energy he uses to help Tarfeil and the cherub after he took his vows; albeit finding such matters trivial did push him to his limit. He was running on fumes when he met Semyaza as he was dealing with the chaos bubble surrounding the grand library.<br />
<br />
“So we are agreed,” a young looking Lucifer speaking; “this will be our final stand against Tiamat.”<br />
“If we falter,” Astaroth nodding; “then all is lost.”<br />
Enoch watched as his angelic father and aunt flew towards a large mass of inky blackness pushing through a portal. Jehovah and his Uncle Michael were also there; Enoch even recognized a young looking Kusheil and several other angels he didin’t recognize.<br />
<br />
“Watch and learn,” a voice from nowhere whispering. Enoch tried to find the source of the voice but couldn’t. looking at the battle before him; he couldn’t help but notice that the creature refered to Tiamat was almost like the description of the many elder gods from the bizarre author H.P Lovecraft; with a mass of tentacles surrounded by a single large eye. Enoch observed as several angels were wiped out with a single swipe from the beast; his father and aunt slicing through the mass as they reach the eye. They were soon joined by his Uncle Michael and Jehovah himself.<br />
“We need to blind Tiamat,” Jehovah looking less like a doddering old fool and more like a man who has seen hardship and is determined to prevent others from suffering like he has.<br />
“Then let me do it,” Lucifer not thinking as he tosses his sword Light-Bringer like a spear to Tiamat’s eye.”<br />
“No,” Jehovah shouting; “not like that!”<br />
<br />
But it was too late. The sword flew true and struck Tiamat dead center in the pupil; an unearthly howl bellowed from the beast as it slowly fell back in through the portal. Enoch tried to listen to more of Jehovah’s words but they were a buzz as the scene quickly faded away.<br />
“That was one of my memories,” that same voice from nowhere speaking; “they are your memories, now that we are one.”<br />
“You’re the sword my father threw,” Enoch shouting into the void; “show yourself!”<br />
“As you wish.”<br />
<br />
Enoch found himself standing in a long hall; dimly lit as the occupants sat silently eating what looked like a final meal. The look on the men’s face show that they were tired; morale gone.<br />
“The enemy approaches,” a messenger approaching what looks like the leader; sitting in a throne with a troubled look on his brow.<br />
“How soon until they breach the keep,” the man speaking.<br />
“Not long,” the messenger shaking his head; turning his head as the sounds of a battering ram could be heard not far.<br />
“Fill you belly one last time, for we are all going to die today.” The leader speaking as he holds the sword he found in a cave years ago. The sword was the same that Lucifer threw into Tiamat. It was Light Bringer and the leader got up and flung it down a well that has since been poisoned by the besiegers. He then orders the remaining men to fill the well with the last of the hot oil and boulders they had to defend their keep.<br />
“If I can’t have the sword,” the leader picking up a goblet of wine….<br />
<br />
“No one can,” Enoch observing as the scene fades again.<br />
“Is that where you were found centuries later,” Enoch shouting; “in the ruins of some forgotten castle?”<br />
“Where we were found,” the voice answering; “my memories are now yours.”<br />
“Tell me something I don’t know,” Enoch shouting; “no more riddles! Meet me face to face!”<br />
&quot;No. You need to see for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a new scene; familiar. Enoch recognized the place; it was the heart of hell. He observed as both he and his father slowly made their way in the volcano just outside of Dis. Both stunned to see lord Adrammelech plunging an obscene blade into the condemned human soul staked over the ward the Enoch went to repair. Surrounded by twelve thralls in hooded robes, watching as Adrammelech ripped out the heart before fleeing through a portal.<br />
“Nice try,” Enoch shouting; “this is my memory.”<br />
“Our memory,” The voice speaking; “but you missed something. Look again.”<br />
<br />
Enoch once again watched the scene play out. Adrammelech ripping the heart from the poor soul then leaving; over and over again. But then Enoch remembered. “Chanting,” Enoch swearing; “the robed twits were chanting.”<br />
“Now figure out what they were doing,” the voice booming.<br />
The ward was damaged as Enoch suspected; it had sigils of Beelzebub corrupting it. Beelzebub, Enoch pondered.<br />
“But you were poisoned before this took place,” Enoch watching the scene played out again. Taking the time to observe the hooded robes as they move; their words in an ancient dead language that no human has spoken since recorded history.<br />
“Fuck me ridged,” Enoch swearing; “this was a resurrection ritual!”<br />
“Now you know who is Tiamat&#39;s puppet,” the voice booming; as the scene fades and blackness envelopes Enoch once again.<br />
<br />
“Beelzebub is the cause of all this,” Enoch shouting as he wakes up; “he’s alive!”</p>
