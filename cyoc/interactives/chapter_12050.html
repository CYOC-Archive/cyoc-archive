<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One minute Roger was in his dorm and the next minute he was seated in a restaurant at a table. A salad was on a plate in front of him as he was sitting across from a woman who looked like she was in her mid thirties with brown hair, brown eyes and big breasts which were covered by a denim jumper with a white tee shirt underneath. It was Simone sitting across from him Roger said to himself as he began to think about what he was going to do to Mark when he got back in his body. That's when Roger noticed the women's face. The woman didn't have as many wrinkles as he thought Simone did, not to mention her hair looked different, a new style maybe? However he thought back to all the times he ever was by Simone and she always had long brown hair, this woman had her hair down to her ears at the most. Roger studied the woman more until the woman's expression changed &quot;Do I have something on my face or on my teeth,&quot; she said while giving a questioning look to Roger.<br />
<br />
The voice sounded like Simone, Roger thought as he went to answer Simone, &quot;No.&quot; however hearing his new voice for the first time, it too sounded familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what is it? Why are you staring at me like that?&quot; Simone questioned, as her face was stern waiting for a response. Roger tried thinking of the correct words for the situation, however the right ones never came, only he was interrupted from his thoughts by the woman. <br />
<br />
The woman started laughing and a smile came to her face &quot;You’re always like this on days when your husband is coming back Simone. All day your spaced out, probably thinking about what you plan on doing to John. But I can't blame you because I would be the same way if I had to wait a month to have sex with Bill,&quot; the woman stated and rolled her eyes in ecstasy obviously thinking about having sex with her husband. At the same time a smile came to Roger's face, which the other woman interrupted it as a smile due to a similar evil thought, but the smile was for the voice of the other woman calling Roger, Simone. The smile stayed on his face as he thought about how he was going to thank Mark now that the device worked, however he wondered who was this other person and why did she look and talk like Simone.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you what sis,” the other woman began again as soon as Robert heard the word sis he could have kicked himself no wonder why she looks like Simone, she is her sister. Robert’s mind went back to his dad’s wedding, picturing this woman there. The picture that came to him was the picture of her and her husband, with two young boys, and then her name popped into his head, Joanna. This is Simone’s sister Joanna, Roger thought as Joanna continued to talk. “I know you have more money then me and can afford to buy it on your own, however how about I treat you to the red teddy you had your eye on at Victoria Secrets.” The expression on Robert’s face turned to shock. “You think I don’t notice, the way you were looking at it imagining you were wearing it for John, I mean the whole store could see what you were thinking, Simone. “ She said then took a drink of water and started again. “Which is why I was quite surprised when you didn‘t buy it. However now I can see you’re regretting it, since your still thinking about it an hour later. So after lunch we’ll go back there and I will buy it as a special gift for my only sister, and don’t even think about saying no!” <br />
<br />
All Roger could do was smile and say “Thanks Joanna, you’re the greatest sister a woman could have.”<br />
<br />
Joanna reached across the table and placed her hand over Roger’s hand. Roger looked down, to the sight of one arm which was covered by a sleeve of a black blazer and one arm that was slim, tan and hairless and as his gaze went lower he noticed two hands meeting on the table. One with manicured nails painted a dark red and the other with nails that were cleaner and a little longer then the ones on his old body.  “I know I am sis” Joanna said and then pulled her hand off leaving Roger staring at only one hand. The hand with dark red nails and a diamond wedding ring, which was now visible after being covered up by Joanna’s hand a second ago. It was the same diamond ring that as the best man he handed to his dad, who placed it on Simone‘s hand at their wedding ceremony. <br />
<br />
“You better eat the rest of your salad Simone this might be the last time you eat today” Roger heard Joanna say and laugh as he turned his gaze away from his hand and ring and turned it to the salad and the fork next to it. When Roger looked at the salad his eyes could clearly see the bulge at his chest, however he always made sure not to stare at breasts just take a glimpse and look away. So this is what he did as he began to eat his salad. <br />
<br />
With each bite he began to notice and feel different things on his new body as he listened to Joanna talk about her life while he added comments in when needed. First he noticed the feel of his long brown hair brushing against his neck and ears with each move he made. He also felt the straps of the bra on his shoulders and the feeling of support the bra gave so that he could hardly feel the weight of his huge breasts.  Roger then noticed the gray silk blouse he was wearing and the gold necklace that was hanging down, and he loved how every time he moved he could feel the fabric rubbing against his skin. However what struck him was the buttons on the blouse, which were on the other side of his shirts he was used to wearing, they looked like they were ready to explode off the blouse from having to cover his huge breasts.  Roger also noticed the way the black blazer buttoned up only two buttons helped make the outfit complete. Roger picked up the napkin off his lap to wipe his mouth and he noticed the way he was sitting, he was sitting with his legs crossed and if felt comfortable.  Then when he was returning the napkin to his lap he happen to notice his legs which were covered by a black skirt that showed a little leg, however the leg was covered up by black nylons.  Which brought his mind to his feet if he was wearing a skirt and nylons, that meant as he wiggled his toes and moved his feet to confirm his theory, he was wearing high heels. Finally when he was finishing his salad, he went to take a drink of water and he noticed the dark red lip print from Simone’s lipstick on the glass and he placed his lips right over the same spot as he took a drink, just as Simone did before.  <br />
<br />
When lunch was finished and the bill paid, they both headed to Joanna’s minivan. Roger stumbled a little trying to walk in high heels for the first time, while trying to ignore the new sensation of the nylons rubbing against something silky and smooth on his legs, however he did make it to the van. Joanna then started the van, which allowed Roger to see a clock that read 2:45 p.m. as Joanna drove of in the direction of the mall. <br />
<br />
They pulled into the mall parking lot where Joanna found a spot, turned the van off, and suggested that she just run in and get the teddy. Roger agreed quickly since he didn’t want to make a fool of himself in the mall trying to walk in high heels.  <br />
<br />
As Roger was waiting for Joanna he pulled down the sun visor down and looked into the mirror on the backside of the visor. There was Simone staring at him, the tan face and brown eyes, and all her makeup including the dark red lips. Roger also noticed the beginning of a few wrinkles along with the brown hair and the bangs that hung down on his forehead. He brought his dark red lips together and blew the reflection a kiss as the reflection did the same to him. He put up the visor just and waited. However he wanted to explore something else and he grabbed the black purse that was by his heels and opened it up. He found an assortment of female products from lipstick to tampons. Also he noticed keys and inspected a few recognizing the house key and his dad’s car key but the rest seemed foreign to him. Then Roger found what he was looking for. He paged through the wallet with the credit cards and saw the driver’s license, right now his driver’s license which read Simone H. Henderson born on 5/07/1965 brown hair, brown eyes. Roger looked up from the license and noticed Joanna coming out of the mall with a box in her hands and a purse over her shoulder. Roger scrambled and put everything back in the purse and returned it to her feet, as Joanna entered the minivan and handed Roger the box “here you go sis” she said and smiled. <br />
<br />
Roger took the box from her hand “Thank you Joanna” and he held the box in his hand and gave her a hug. Joanna then started the van and headed out of the mall parking lot.  Roger got realized the direction they were heading, right to his dad’s house. Within twenty minutes they were at his dad’s house. <br />
<br />
Roger got out of the van with the box in his hands and the purse over his shoulder and waved bye to Joanna. Roger headed up the walkway and pulled the keys from his purse and unlocked the door. He turned the knob and entered the house closing the door behind him. He set the box on the table by the couch only he was startled when he heard a voice from behind him where he just entered “You must really need it bad today Simone, you forgot about the rest of your packages.”  <br />
<br />
Roger turned around and saw Joanna picking up three bags from the doorstep and entering the house “sorry sis I,” Roger went to say but was cut off by Joanna.<br />
<br />
“There is no need to apologize sis, I always tell you I would probably be acting ten times worse if I had to go without my husband for a whole month. However part of the reason I go shopping with you on days like this I just love the way you act, it just makes me hold Bill a little closer at night.” Joanna stated as she handed Roger some bags.  “I’ll call you in a few days so I can get all the details” and Joanna turned and was out the door closing it behind her. Roger went over to the window and watched Joanna pull out of the driveway and down the street as Roger heard the clock chime and he looked at the clock and saw it was now 4:00 p.m.<br />
<br />
Roger remembered the last time he looked at a clock it said 2:45 and it was now 4:00 pm., and he figured he was at the restaurant for at least a half-hour or forty-five minutes. So he did the math in his head and he realized that any minute he would change without getting to explore this body even see what it might look in that red teddy.  So he kicked off his high heels grabbed the box and headed upstairs to their bedroom. <br />
<br />
In the bedroom he quickly unbuttoned the black blazer and slid it off his shoulders on to the floor, and then began unbuttoning the blouse struggling with the buttons as he went. When the blouse was unbuttoned he slipped it off his shoulders and flung it on the floor a few feet away from the blazer. Roger looked down and noticed a black lacy bra which only came half way up his breasts, however remembering he was pressed for time he moved on to the skirt which he started wrestling with. First he tried slipping the skirt off but it wouldn’t go over his hips, he then felt a zipper and button on the back. Roger fumbled with it for awhile until he realized it would be easier to do it from the front. So he turned the skirt around so the back was now in front and undid the button and pulled down the zipper. The skirt slid off his legs easily, landing on the floor. When the skirt was off Roger noticed why it felt so sensational walking he was wearing a silk white half-slip which was rubbing against his legs every time he took a step. Roger quickly slid the half-slip off his legs onto the skirt that rested on the floor, as the black full-length nylons covering a pair of black bikini panties came into view. He quickly sat down on the bed and pulled off the nylons not caring that they were in a ball and probably ruined due to his rush. Now all Roger had left were two items and he slipped of the bra pulling it down below his breasts on to his stomach as he got the idea to spin it around and unhook it like he did with the skirt. When the bra was off he fought hard to ignore his breast until he was totally nude, so he slid off the panties and stepped out of them, leaving them on the floor with the bra. Roger now was now a naked Simone lying on a bed and he couldn’t wait to see what he looked like, so he got up from the bed and moved in front of the mirror to see his new body. <br />
<br />
The body was tan in all places, which meant that Simone tanned nude. He reached his manicured hand up to his breasts and gently caresses them causing the dark brown nipples to harden and become firm and quite big. He rubbed his breasts as he started to feel a dampness coming from below. He moved his hand down to the area to investigate the dampness for himself. He had a hard time looking down past his breasts so he looked in the mirror at the hairless pussy and the woman tracing her manicured nails around the lips. Roger wanted to continue however he wanted something first, he wanted to see exactly what his dad was getting tonight so he went over and ripped open the box.<br />
<br />
He saw a sea of red and pulled out the first item a red lace robe that went down to the thighs at best. He quickly placed it on the bed and picked out the other item, the red teddy. It was made of almost entirely of lace and as he held it up he admired the fabric. He opened the teddy up so he could step into it, however as he was sliding his legs into it he soon realized there was nothing separating the two legs. Then he noticed the snaps on the front and reached around and found snaps on the back, and he smiled thinking about the easy access it was for his dad. Roger continued to pull the teddy up his body and adjusted the straps around his shoulders, which the fabric did nothing to hide, since the only material above his breasts was the strap. The teddy fit like a glove and he loved seeing the little white bow by his breasts. Roger also could see his nipples through the lace of the fabric; yeah this teddy left little to the imagination. He reached down to snap the bottom brushing past the lace around his legs. With each snap he sealed himself more and more in the teddy. When he was snapped in he picked up the robe and slipped his arms in as he thought to himself, that he only needed one more thing to make the outfit complete. So he went over to the closet and found a pair of red high heels and slipped them on his feet. He then headed over to the mirror to see what his dad would get tonight and what stared back at him was every man’s fantasy. Roger moved his hand down to his pussy and placed a finger underneath the fabric, he was about to drive this body to ecstasy, when he noticed something else in the mirror. His heart started to beet faster as he slid his finger from underneath the fabric, and looked at the clock which now read 4:13 shouldn’t he be in his own body by now. Nah he thought to himself to ease his concern, I must have a few minutes. <br />
<br />
So Roger decided to pick up the clothes in the bedroom he discarded minutes earlier in a rush to see his new body. Roger picked up one item at a time and worked slowly while watching the clock pass minute by minute. He had the skirt, blouse and blazer on the clothes rack in the corner while the bra; panties and slip were in the clothes hamper in the other corner. As for the nylons, they looked like they had a hole in so he placed them along with the tissue paper in the box in the garbage.  Finally he ripped the corners of the box flattening it for recycling. With his tasks completed Roger sat on the bed with the box in his hand and reluctantly looked at the clock, which now read 4:20 p.m. <br />
<br />
His mind raced through the time scenario again he looked at the clock in the car which read 2:45 and at the clock in his house when he arrived home which read 4:00 it now reads 4:20. That means that I know I was in this body for one hour and thirty-five minutes. Plus the time at the restaurant to eat, talk, pay the bill, walk to the car, start the car, was that only twenty five minutes Roger questioned himself as he looked at the clock again which now read 4:21, twenty four minutes I mean. <br />
<br />
Roger sat on the bed scared out of his mind as he watched the time go by soon it was now 4:30 and he knew something was wrong. The phone rang and Roger jumped from his bed and went over to the cordless phone on his parent’s dresser. “Hello” Roger said.<br />
