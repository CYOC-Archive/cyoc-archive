<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stacy said &quot;That sounds like a wonderful idea hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to stay on our property Dru&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dru asked.<br />
<br />
Jeremy chuckled and said &quot;The woods beyond our property are not protected by the magic. There hunters could shoot you and kill you. Then they would either stuff you or send you to some sort of lab. We don't want to lose you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay daddy&quot; Dru said. &quot;I'll stay wifin da pwoperty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you will&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Remember that there are flags marking the boundaries of our property. Don't stray past those flags.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay daddy&quot; Dru said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my little vixen pup&quot; Stacy said as she knelt and gave Dru a hug. When she stood back up she said &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
They left the house and ran into the woods. It was a wonderful feeling being able to run like this. The smells and sounds flooded her and were much more pronounced than her human form.<br />
<br />
As Dru was running she thought about her wish. She had wished to be a girl so she could understand why they acted so immature. She could see where the machine would interpret that to make her a little girl. What she didn't understand was where it had gotten the were-fox from. It was true that she had thought about anthropomorphs before and what it would be like to be one.<br />
<br />
Dru thought about her form now. It was that of a fox but with some human features mixed in. She was running on two legs instead of all fours and she could form words instead of barking. She still retained her human intelligence but there was something of the fox in her now too. Her hands still had opposable thumbs which allowed her to grab onto things. She wasn't like this full time like she would be if she was an anthro fox. She could change. She was a were-fox, not an anthro fox.<br />
<br />
'Why did the machine make me a were-fox?' Dru thought as she continued to run. If the machine had somehow picked up on her interest in anthros than why did it make her a were instead of an anthro. She thought back to what she was thinking when she made her wish. She had been thinking about the girl who had turned her down. She had acted snobbish and said her tastes in men was much more refined. When she pictured the girl she was wearing a fox fur coat in her imagination and turning into a fox. The machine had to interpret that to mean a were-fox.<br />
<br />
Dru was pulled from her thoughts by the sound of a vixen kit yipping for her mother. She didn't know how she knew that but she did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that poor kit&quot; Stacy said. &quot;We should go see if we can help her hun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we should&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Dru, stay behind us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay daddy&quot; Dru said. She was glad that they would be trying to help the kit.<br />
<br />
They moved silently toward the sound. After a few moments they came within site of a clearing. Dru saw little flags just at the edge of the clearing which meant that they were at the edge of the property and thus the magic's protection. As they peered into the clearing they saw an awful sight to them.<br />
<br />
There was indeed a vixen kit in the middle of the clearing but she was in a cage. What was worse was there were many foxes lying around the cage. Dru could smell blood and knew that the foxes had been shot. The only question was where were the hunters.<br />
<br />
Just then two men came into the clearing carrying rifles. They were laughing and patting each other on their backs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Joe&quot; one of them said, &quot;it looks like a good nights hunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is at that Stan&quot; Joe said. &quot;Two full grown foxes and four kits not including the one in the cage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sure is easier when they come to us&quot; Stan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they are just dumb animals&quot; Joe said. &quot;Once we had the kit trapped it did the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a good thing that they're not intelligent or we could be in trouble&quot; Stan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll never be intelligent&quot; Joe said. &quot;And this yipping is getting on my nerves. It's time to shut this kit up.&quot; He pointed his rifle at the kit in the cage with a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not allow this&quot; Jeremy said and rushed at Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here Dru&quot; Stacy said and she rushed Stan.<br />
<br />
The hunters didn't stand a chance. Jeremy and Stacy hit them so fast and so hard that they couldn't react. It was over in seconds and they were slumped on the ground unconscious.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds Stacy said &quot;You can come out now Dru.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru slowly stepped into the clearing. She was nervous despite her mother saying it was ok. She knew that the clearing was outside of their property and thus wasn't protected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru, I need you to help me get these poor foxes onto our property&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Hun, while we do that why don't you get that kit out of the cage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright hun&quot; Stacy said as she went over to the cage.<br />
<br />
Dru and her father started to carry the dead foxes onto their property. Dru wasn't surprised that tears started to stream down her face as she picked up one of the dead kits. 'What did this kit do to be shot?' she thought.<br />
<br />
When they had the dead foxes on their property and Dru's mother had the vixen kit out of the cage Jeremy said &quot;We need to get back to the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we do hun&quot; Stacy said as she held the vixen kit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to kill them?&quot; Dru asked nodding toward the hunters.<br />
<br />
Jeremy knelt down and said &quot;We do not kill unless it's for food. We'll leave them there to whatever fate will befall them. If they live they live. If they die they die. I think the later will be more likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dru asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though the clearing isn't on our property it is close&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;The magic knows what happened and will decide what type of punishment they will receive. Now we need to get back to the house.&quot; With that he stood up and turned back toward the house.<br />
<br />
Dru was a little confused but decided that she should keep up with her parents. She would understand soon enough.</p>
