<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now be good for your sister,&quot; Holly&#39;s mother told her in almost a chastising way, &quot;We&#39;ll see you both tomorrow at church.&quot; Holly sighed and merely nodded her head, not used to the prospect of needing a &quot;babysitter&quot;, let alone one who just a few days before had been her younger sibling. She grimaced when she felt Taylor...at least that was what her older sister was actively calling herself now...walk up behind her and place her hand on her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry mom, we&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Taylor replied in an almost chipper fashion, causing their mother to smile. Their parents were having a &quot;date night&quot; as it were, going to dinner and spending the night in a hotel for their anniversary, and that they would return for church in the morning and Sunday Brunch afterwards. Holly slowly walked away and stalked back to her room, the events of the last 24 hours circling in her mind. She couldn&#39;t figure out how her brother (his name escaped her at the moment) had found out about the Amulet, or why he had just made himself into an older girl. She considered that it had simply been an accident, but then why hadn&#39;t she tried to change herself into a boy again. Did she like being a girl? Holly could certainly understand that point, but then she herself wouldn&#39;t want to be a disgusting boy either. Then there was the point that Taylor was acting....nice to her. Not at all like she had when she was her brother. She had complimented her new dress and actually helped Holly with a small bit of makeup when she had caught her snooping through her room that morning looking for the Amulet (Holly had used the makeup as an excuse to hide her actual plans.) Was it all an act? She didn&#39;t think her sister was that smart, but then again getting older might of changed more than just her body.<br />
<br />
As they both said goodbye to their parents, Holly from a distance and Taylor from the hallway, her older sister turned and looked at Holly. &quot;I&#39;m gonna have a friend over later,&quot; she explained, &quot;But that&#39;ll be our little secret...&quot; Taylor winked at her sister, causing Holly to inadvertently giggle. As Holly walked away again, she almost grew white-faced at the idea. If she didn&#39;t stop herself, it was getting really easy to think of Taylor as her older sister. She was even remembering things about when she was younger and having an older sibling, memories she knew weren&#39;t real. Or were they? It was getting harder and harder to remember the old reality. Holly needed to find the Amulet and figure out how to set things right again, before she couldn&#39;t remember enough to do so.<br />
<br />
Taylor, for her part, still remembered that she had been a boy. Still remembered everything that Holly had done and was planning to do to her. But, she quickly figured out, acting like nothing was wrong and perfectly normal was torturing her sister more than she could ever plan to do herself. Besides, she could get even with her some other time, tonight she had other plans. She had secretly made a pact with her &quot;boyfriend&quot; Jacob to come over after 10, when Holly would be asleep and they could hang out together. She shuddered at that thought, her 8-year-old self not really knowing why, but it made her have all kinds of good feelings. She figured she would just act naturally as she had been, letting her body go on autopilot for a while and just see what happened. She already had found a pair of boxer shorts from the clothing donation bag that should let her change into a boy and keep her older body, storing them near the Amulet. As long as she remembered who she had been, a boy, then she would be alright. The fact that her old name seemed to be a distant memory at this time never really crossed her mind.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the evening, the two sisters interacted with each other as if they were two perfectly normal sisters. They ate dinner together, played a couple of board games together, even gave each other a pedicure. Holly acted this way simply to keep up appearences, but for Taylor it was becoming easier and easier to slip into this elder sister role. Besides, she told herself, the end result when she did get even with Holly would be all the sweeter for it. Soon enough, 10 o&#39;clock came, and Holly begrudgingly went to bed, though having enjoyed her sisterly bonding time with Taylor. Holly told herself that if this was it and things remained the way they were, it wouldn&#39;t be all bad. Still, she needed to find the Amulet, to keep it from being used against her if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Taylor though, readied herself for her company, throwing on a more comfortable set of clothes before she saw Jacob&#39;s truck pull into the driveway, lights off. A part of her felt daring to be doing this, defying instructions from her parents. Jacob would just stay a couple of hours, certainly long enough for them to enjoy each other&#39;s company. Taylor heard the knock on the door and let her boyfriend in, getting a quick peck on the cheek as she did that made her feel flustered. They both sat down on the couch, just enjoying being in each other&#39;s company and talking about small things. Taylor&#39;s body seemed to continue on its Autopilot as she and Jacob grew closer together, and before long began making out with one another, their tongues intertwining with each other. The 8-year-old boy inside Taylor, who&#39;s voice was growing dimmer but the moment, was suddenly grossed out by this concept, but Taylor&#39;s own mind and body answered every pleasurable feeling with a simple command of &#39;More.&#39; She broke away from the hot and heavy session to push Jacob down onto the couch, removing her blouse and skirt in a quick motion before almost ripping the shirt off of Jacob as well. The two resumed their ministrations, clothing becoming more and more scarce as each gave into their primal desires. Before long, they were both naked with Jacob positioned over the entrance to Taylor&#39;s womb, and with one fell swoop he plunged in.<br />
<br />
The part of Taylor that was still Dion quickly subsided, overwhelmed by the feelings that this body was generating. If he had known that being a girl...no...being a woman, could feel this good, then he never would have fought it. As she succumbed once and for all to these feelings, she decided she would bin the Amulet the next morning. She wasn&#39;t going back, not after this feeling. As orgasm rushed over her body, and she felt a hot stream shoot into her womb, she smiled at the thoughts of her new life and new body, all memories of her former self settling into the back of her mind. <br />
<br />
Of course, her distraction provided the opportunity that Holly had needed to find the Amulet herself...</p>
