<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You feel your joints soften as you&#39;re given freedom to move again. Tentatively, still eyeing the Queen, you rise to your feet, stretching and shaking the fatigue out. Now that you could move your head, you examined the room beyond the tea party setup before you.<br />
<br />
The world was bathed in a slight violet tint as you found yourself to be in an appealing bedroom, furnished for that of a young girl. You breathe in shallowly as you lift your arms out in front of you. They were thin and smooth, bearing the same pale skin tone throughout. You slid the sleeves of your black dress down and lifted up your skirts. You could feel the faint twinge of rubber and latex rubbing as you experimentally lifted up your legs, gawking at the perfect proportions.<br />
<br />
The queen had a self-satisfied smile on her lips, the kind when you&#39;re project turned out as expected, if not exceeding expectations. Sitting beside her was another doll. This one had long blonde hair, with pigtails on the sides holding up a bow. A little blue bow was tied around her neck, and she was wearing an adorable blue and white dress. Her feet were tucked underneath the dress so you couldn&#39;t see what else it was wearing.<br />
<br />
You tried to ask if there was someone in the doll, but the muffled, girlish whines emanating from your mask reminded you of the gag that was also in place. You settled for pointing a finger curiously at the doll.<br />
&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t worry about her. Your new friend won&#39;t give you any trouble.&quot; <br />
The queen purses her lips together and looks back and forth between the two dolls. <br />
&quot;You know what? I don&#39;t like the theme you two have any longer. Your outfit is too dark, too melancholy. We need to get something brighter to lift the mood here.<br />
<br />
She beckoned you over to a large walk-in closet and thrusted it open, revealing the interior. Inside was an assortment of dresses, wigs, and what looked like different doll eyes. <br />
&quot;Wait out here for just a moment.&quot; She gave a small smile and disappeared into the depths. Seeing an opportunity, you quickly minced over to the door, nearly stumbling in your shoes, and tried the handle. Locked. The room had no windows, which meant that you&#39;re only exit was through the door. Perhaps you&#39;ll have to play along until you can escape; maybe this time it would work?<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! I got everything you&#39;ll need to be beautiful!&quot;<br />
<br />
Underneath her arm was one of the most beautiful dresses you had ever seen. It seemed to glow with an aura as you took in the multiple bows and frills. It was a lovely shade of pink and white, with blue trim running through it. Lacy, blue trim and iridescent white pearls fastened the many bows to the dress and a few pink and blue roses adorned it as well. Your current dress looked drab compared to this delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take it by your frozen smile that you agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
She led you to a mirror in a corner of the room and helped take your black dress off. Soon it was in a neat pile below you, with the matching underwear as well. She retrieved a new, lacy, white set that soon covered up your sensitive areas. You were amazed at how smooth the unblemished doll body looked, with a kind face eternally smiling at the top. It was you; but it couldn&#39;t possibly be you. <br />
Your new dress was whisked over your head and your purple wig was brought through the neck. A lacy white choker with a rose on it was tightly wrapped around your neck as your arms billowed out of the large sleeves, only serving to make your hands look even smaller. A corset was lightly cinched up and a big bow was fastened at your waist. After the dress was smoothed out, the queen rolled a pair of white, satin gloves over your hands and a pair of white stockings of the same material. You were pleased with how the stockings clung to your legs, which were feeling many different pressures right now, culminating to a warm, tight embrace. For your new shoes, you now had a white pair of heels that wrapped around your ankle with the trademark rose and ribbon duo of the dress. With a bouquet of similar pink roses nestled in your arm, you now had completed the new look.<br />
<br />
However, your previous purple hair and eyes seemed to detract from the look. They clashed a bit to much with the soft elegance of the new dress. The queen left your side, leaving you to marvel at your new attire. You did a little spin and walked around in your new shoes. Suddenly, the queen had returned with something behind your back.<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t be able to check, but I think you would enjoy this the most if you close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure why you were following her instructions, but you complied and squeezed them shut. You felt a slight tugging on your head, as well as a new weight being placed above.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you can look now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You opened your eyes to be faced with your image through a sky-bluish tint; the queen had given you a new eye color. You felt a gasp inwardly as you looked at your doll face. It was still the same shape, same smile, but your hair had changed everything. While before you had seemed to be cloaked in darkness, with the doll smile representing how the queen had won, you now seemed to radiate an aura that made you joyful. Your hair was now a lovely auburn, tied up in the back, with a sweeping bang down the front, and two hanging tresses down the side of your face. And above it was a large, fashionable hat with roses and feathers. You could now see that you noe perfectly complemented your new room, as well as your companion.<br />
<br />
You were so entranced with your new image that you hardly noticed the queen raising a remote behind you and clicking a button on it.</p>
