<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>First try writing one of these, let&#39;s see how it goes.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As  soon as Mr Adams turned around I decided to teach him a lesson, I thought he was quite rude to the newly minted janitor, so maybe they should be a team!<br />
<br />
Just as the door closed, Mr Addams got a weird feeling in his head, getting slightly dizzy as the world seemed to be spinning, by the time he came to, a very different man was standing just outside the classroom door.<br />
<br />
Where there was once a thin bespectacled man on his late thirties, now stood a burly looking man in his early fifties. The hulking figure stood at nearly 7&#39; feet tall and with a good mix of fat and muscle on his 340 pound frame, the man looked very unlike the other faculty in the building, with big strong arms, tree trunk legs and a somewhat wild and unkempt beard on his face, the kind you get when you haven&#39;t seen a razor in weeks or even months. He idly scratched his hairy armpit as the smart clothes he was wearing turned into stain filled coveralls with the words *JANITOR - Ed Addams* embroidered in the upper right pocket.<br />
<br />
Once the world stopped spinning Ed came back to himself with a start and said: &quot;damnit I spaced out again and lost sight of Huff, that damn pig better be working or I swear I will beat his ass raw&quot; while continuing to scratch his armpit, seemingly not caring at all about his crass behavior.<br />
<br />
Inside the classroom Jeff snickered and called out to  Mr Addams; &quot;Hey Ed! Go get Huff and get back in here, we got a lot to talk about&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Ed heard Jeff&#39;s voice, his heart skipped a beat, suddenly aware of the uncomfortable erection stuffed inside his now very tented coveralls. As a giant of a man they were somewhat tight on him, specially in the belly and crotch area, and didn&#39;t left anything to the imagination.<br />
<br />
Ed stopped scratching his armpit and with seemingly no thought on his part took a whiff of them, as he turned around and said: &quot;Sure thing Boss, let me go grab that fatass, I will be back in a jiffy&quot;, while thinking how lucky he was to have found a guy like Jeff to boss him around. <br />
<br />
Inside the classroom Jeff felt a slight headache as new memories started pouring into his head, it now seems like changing too much about two people at once had a larger effect than he expected.<br />
<br />
In this new reality Mr Addams is a former biker who ran into Jeff a few months back while passing through town on his Harley, as soon as Ed got a look at Jeff he became obsessed, he was the kind of guy who messed around with other bikers and truckers from time to time, but what he felt for Jeff as soon as he laid his eyes on him was too much for his simple mind to understand. In a daze he parked his Harley in front of Jeff while he waited at a bus stop, and started chatting him up. After only a few minutes he was on his knees begging Jeff to let him hang around, telling him how he needed to be near him, to protect him, to be with him.<br />
<br />
For his part the Jeff from this reality thought the guy was joking with him, or that he was insane or something. When a huge manly guy starts talking to you from nowhere with a dazed look in his face, you assume the worst, he only got more confused when the guy got on his knees and started begging him to let him hang around. &quot;It seemed that this guy is the real deal&quot; thought Jeff at the time, and so he decided to test him by telling him: &quot;look man if you aren&#39;t screwing with me, prove it by breaking the shit out of your bike&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as he heard Jeff&#39;s command, the guy got up, went to his bike,  pushed it on its side and started stomping the ever living shit out of it. &quot;Break ya freaking piece of shit, my guy wants you broken and I will break ya&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised to say the least, as he saw the guy, old enough to be his father,  beat the stuffing out of his own bike just because he told him to. &quot;STOP!&quot; He said to the guy, as he saw him grab one of the rear view mirrors trying to rip it out. &quot;That&#39;s enough!, I believe you okay!?&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Ed heard Jeff yelling him to stop he jumped and made a *Yelp* sound while turning around, sheepishly looking at Jeff  and saying &quot;hope I didn&#39;t scare ya Boy, I was just trying to prove ya how serious I am&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at the biker with a mix of incredulity and excitement, not caring that the guy was acting crazy, just feeling a rush of power at bossing this manly guy around. Jeff knew he was gay from a young age, and always had a thing for daddies. And the guy in front of him fit the bill perfectly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come here&quot; he said to the guy, &quot;I don&#39;t even know your name&quot;, Ed scampered as fast as his booted feet allowed him to and stood in front of his Boy (not even knowing the boys name he simply called him &quot;Boy&quot; in his head, feeling a rush of excitement every time he thought of the word). &quot;The name is Ed, Ed Addams, but you may call me whatever you want&quot; he said as he extended his arm in handshake.<br />
<br />
The Jeff from this reality stared at the grizzled man&#39;s calloused hand, where his biker gloves had torn up while trying to break his own bike, taking it and feeling the guy gasp as he touched him &quot;Well I am Jeff&quot; he said to Ed, &quot;And I hope that bike still works, cause people are staring and I want to get out of here&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed frowned and started looking around, and sure enough a small crowd of people had stopped on the other side of the street to watch an old biker breaking his own bike for seemingly no reason. &quot;Bah&quot; he growled, &quot;let them stare, I don&#39;t give a rats ass what people think, I&#39;m just happy I ran into ya&quot; he said to Jeff while smiling  (he had big yellow teeth, the kind a guy gets when he smokes a lot of cigars), &quot;Let me pick up ol&#39; bob here&quot; he said while bending over, showing me his muscular and wide rear, &quot;Ain&#39;t the first time he got a beating, first time from me tough, ha!&quot; He said while picking up and dusting off his bike.<br />
<br />
Jeff kept staring at Ed while he dusted off his bike, paying special attention to the his huge muscular arms, tough looking gut and gigantic feet, &quot;the guy has to be at least 7&#39; feet tall&quot; thought Jeff while looking at Ed grumbling at his bike, seemingly blaming it for breaking too easily. Ed was balding heavily, had a wild looking beard, a big bushy mustache, and was wearing the stereotypical biker clothes, an old leather jacket over a stained wife beater and grungy looking jeans, with a big pair of leather boots, &quot;At least a size 17&quot; thought Jeff. His feet were massive, and even from a distance Jeff could smell the musk coming from the man happily fixing up the bike he was stomping just a moment go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah, good enough&quot; grumbled Ed as he turned around to look at Jeff, smiling as he noticed him staring. &quot;Like what you see boy?&quot; He says while flexing one of his muscular arms, showing a bushy armpit. It seems Ed removed his jacket while Jeff was staring at his booted feet. <br />
<br />
*A big wave of musk almost visible to the naked eye can be felt from that armpit* and Jeff loved every second of it. This big daddy was flirting with him! &quot;In his own crude way&quot; thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Ed&quot; said Jeff with far more confidence he had ever shown, something deep inside himself telling him he was in control of the situation. &quot;Is your bike fixed? We should get going. My house is somewhat near, we can talk more there&quot;. He said to Ed.<br />
<br />
Grinning from ear to ear Ed points at his bike and says &quot;don&#39;t you worry boy, ol&#39; Bob never let me down before, he is just a little beat up now, nothing he and I can&#39;t handle&quot;. Before he gets on his bike, he stares at his letter jacked and passes it to Jeff in a very gentle manner, like a guy trying not to startle a puppy while trying to pet it.<br />
<br />
Jeff takes the guys jacket, it reeks of manly musk and it&#39;s several sizes too big for him. But on a whim he decides to wear it over his shoulders, accepting the gift Ed made him. <br />
<br />
Ed beams at Jeff and for the first time feeling just how tight his pants are, realizing he has been sporting a very noticeable erection, probably for a while now. &quot;Crap&quot; he says in a flustered manner, while trying and failing to adjust his erection in his too tight pants.<br />
<br />
Jeff enjoys the feel of the leather jacket on his back, while smiling at the flustered daddy, &quot;he looks so cute like that, embarrassed of what I might think of him&quot; thought Jeff while Ed was grumbling at his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to go&quot; said Jeff, pushing past the flustered Ed and sitting on the bike, like it was the most natural thing in the world. &quot;Get on, I will give you directions as we go along&quot; said Jeff as Ed stared at him with an elated look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it Boss&quot; said Ed.<br />
<br />
Inside the classroom Jeff&#39;s head was spinning  as he now remembered how his life changed after he met Ed, how he hid him away from his parents, helped him get a job at the school so that he could always be around, and generally just how much he enjoyed bossing the crude guy around.<br />
<br />
While clutching his head, Jeff started sitting straighter, a bit of muscle definition appearing in his body as a now confident smirk adorned his face.   Jeff shook his head around trying to focus, &quot;that was a far bigger change than I expected&quot; he thought staring at the chronivac in his hand, beeping at him that reality had finished adjusting.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems changing too many people at once so much makes reality a bit finicky&quot;  Jeff said while reading the alerts in the chronivac. &quot;But I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t like the end result&quot; thought Jeff as he started feeling himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems Mr Huff also got changed a bit&quot;, said Jeff while looking at the chronivac, it now listed a man called &quot;Cliff Huff&quot; as the other school janitor. He still was a 500 pound man, but with a lot more muscle on him, a former marine turned Janitor after being dishonorably discharged for &quot;disorderly conduct&quot;, and a close &quot;friend&quot; of Ed&#39;s from his biker days. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to meet him&quot; thought Jeff, I want to see my pair of daddies together.</p>
