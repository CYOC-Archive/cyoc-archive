<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richie and Becky quickly grew through their tween years.  Their clothes had been keeping pace with them, changing in size to match their bodies.  But as first Richie then Becky hit 13, their bodies went through a new phase.  Richie started growing taller than before, his arms and legs became a lot lankier.  Becky was soon entering an awkward phase herself where her limbs seem mismatched against her body.  Becky gave a soft whimper as she felt her nipples stand out before they started to push forward.  Their increased sensitivity made Becky feel uncomfortable until a training bra appeared under her shirt.  Similarly, Richie could feel the front of his pants getting tighter.  There wasn&#39;t much he could do about it but hope that Becky didn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
But despite their awkward feelings, they didn&#39;t break off their kiss.  And their persistence was rewarded.  Becky&#39;s small chest was starting to fill out, her nipples rising out on top of cones, her hips started to expand out as her rear became less flat.  Richie&#39;s lanky body was gaining more width as his muscles started to grow.  His arms tickled as the small hairs on them started growing longer and thicker.  Their confidence started to grow, as they got a bit more passionate with their kissing.<br />
<br />
As they went through their high school years, their clothes started to change to new ones.  Becky&#39;s suspenders vanished as her blue jeans became a lot shorter, showing more of her increasingly curvy legs.  The sleeves of her shirt rolled up until they became mere straps at her shoulders.  Her neckline dipped down as her new tank top started showing off more of her increasing cleavage.  Her socks faded as her loafers became opened-toed pumps, showing off her now-painted nails.  Richie&#39;s clothes didn&#39;t change in style much, but they did change in color.  The color of his shirt darkened while the insignia on it lightened until he was now wearing a black shirt with a silver Autobot insignia on it.  His sneakers became more adult as they grew to fit his growing feet, but there was still an Autobot insignia tampographed on the sides, though not as colorful before, clearly a personal customization.  His shorts remained largely unchanged, though an extra set of pockets appeared as they shifted to cargo shorts.<br />
<br />
Becky, now Rebecca, was now a very attractive young woman of 20.  Her fiery red hair was now unbound and splayed over her shoulders and upper back.  Her freckles had mostly faded, but there were still a few there on her beautiful face.  The freckles on Rebecca’s body were a bit more obvious with her tank top exposing quite a bit of skin, especially on the tops of her C-cup breasts, which were boldly displayed.  Her curvy hips and ass were encased in a tight pair of blue jean shorts, leaving her long luscious legs bare between them and her pumps.  Richie, now Richard, was quite handsome himself at 21, his mature face now having a light covering of stubble.  His Autobot shirt was a little loose, but it didn&#39;t hide the muscular chest under it.  His exposed arms and legs also had muscular detail, as well as noticeable dark hair.  And it was pretty obvious that he was sporting a serious erection under his shorts.<br />
<br />
By this point, both Richard and Rebecca were well into their final teen years.  Their kissing was becoming more passionate as their hands went over each other.  Becky moaned a little as she allowed her full breasts to smush against Richie&#39;s broad chest.  Richard was no longer embarrassed by the bulge in his shorts.  In fact, he moved his pelvis forward so that he ground a bit against Becky. Rebecca almost gave a soft squeak, but she didn’t break off the kiss.  She and Richard held on as they keep making passionate love in front of kids that weren’t noticed the two aging.  Speaking of aging, both Rebecca and Richard continued to age through their twenties as they went through college in seconds.<br />
<br />
Rebecca while hot, started to get hotter as her breasts started to explode and increased to CC and her hips bursting and making her curves really shapely.  Her arms and legs weren’t getting longer, but they continued to increase in muscle mass and tone, making her look more athletic then before.  Even her face was showing an angel like look with flat cheekbones, long and elegant nose, small and seductive eyes, and puffy and kissable lips.  The remaining freckles on her face faded away completely, leaving her skin completely smooth while her red hair grew downwards as it descended down her upper back and was reaching the middle of it.  Richard was going through more physic then his girlfriend as his muscle mass kept on increasing.  His shoulders kept on broadening with his chest looking more chiseled then before.  Under that, his stomach was flat and showing off what was once a six-pack in his late teens, not upgrading to an eight pack.  The muscles on his arms and legs were bulging each time he grows and expanded as he gyrate with Rebecca and there were veins bursting out through he skin.  His face was getting more mature as his jaw line continues to give a square like shape.  The stubble around his mouth started to grow slowly but surely, as it started to form a mustache/goatee combo.  His hair was shaggy and redesigned as a bob cut meant for an older and mature man.<br />
<br />
Their clothes soon begin their transition as it matches their older ages.  The straps of Rebecca’s tank top snapped from the shoulders and shrunk into top hem.  The top itself tightened around her, acting like a second skin and the hem lowered to expose more of her breasts.  The bottom hem of her top rose up high and exposed her belly button as a ring pierced her navel.  The color was a combination of black and white lines and was styled to make it look so cool for college students.  Her short pants shrunk up to her mid thighs and the leggings merged into one tube and tightening around her waste and the demin’s fabric shifted into a more latex like with the color going solid black.  Her sandals remained the same, but heels grew out to the back, extending to a mere three inches.  As for Richard, he clothes finally went through a change overhauls.  The Autobot insignia slowly faded away and the color brightened from black to white and the sleeves shrunk away to be nothing but straps, forming a tank top of his own.  While the shorts remained the same, the fabric became more of polyester and the color darkened black with a white strip on the side and an Addidas logo on the other.  The sneaker’s Autobot insignia vanished as well, replaced with the same Addidas logo and redesigned into what would be running sneakers.<br />
<br />
Already, they left their late teens behind and became college sweethearts and goals and ambitions ahead of them.  Richard was passionately kissing Rebecca and pushed his pecks into her striped tube top to squish her huge breasts and his one hand groping on her round ass.  For Rebecca, she was her finger guiding down his abs before proceeding to grab his crotch, which has grown huge during his growth with her balls expanding to the size of softballs, and gently massage.  While their foreplay was less aggressive, they are still feeling each other and groping around.  But the one thing that happened is they have their other hands connected to each other.  That’s when two rings appeared on their index fingers and were shining brightly.  The rings have a gold band around the fingers with a diamond on the top.<br />
<br />
Katie looked to the rings at a distance and realized what they were.  “Hmm…  Interesting…” she stated, “Those look like engagement rings.  Guess that means they are officially engaged.  I’m quite amazed how they are still holding on to their kiss after I made that wish.  Wonder how far they will go?”<br />
<br />
Indeed, the two, since they kissed, has aged considerably into their young adult years. In fact, all their friends who are still playing in the playground, didn’t notice the two aging, as they were preoccupied.  Even Richard and Rebecca wouldn’t remember them as friends, just young strangers to them.  But it didn’t matter, as their bond grew deeper the more they kissed.  But they won’t let go as they feel like they want to go all the way.  So much so, is that their bodies have past their mid twenties and have graduated through college and moving up in the world.<br />
<br />
For Rebecca, her body didn’t grow, but her assets were growing along the way.  Her breasts grew further and now rest of the D cup mark, almost breaking the tube top in the process.  Her hips expand and made her curvy figure more hourglass shape and her stomach was flat as a board.  Her arms and legs have matured into a toned woman with delicate hands and feet and long nails painted in red nail polish.  Her romp expanded to help giving her extra cushioning on the seat.  Her face was at the peak of maturity with high cheekbones, puffy lips, thin and elegant nose, and small and lustful eyes.  Her red hair had more curls as it shrink up to her upper back, but even if it were straight, it would’ve grown down to her lower back.  As for Richard, when he stopped growing, his girth didn’t.  His shoulders broadened as the chest expanded and heaved forward.  His abs grew in deeper showing a huge bumpiness and indents in-between.  Her arms and legs bulged completely as veins were popping into the surface.  Even his own face was as manly as his body with a square jaw, flat and bulbous nose, and small hot eyes.  The hair on his head changed into a sleeker design as his sideburns grew in and connected with the rest of facial hair, forming a full on beard.  He even has hair sprouting on his body as his arms and legs have some dusting, while his chest and stomach exploded with a forest of curly hair.  No doubt, Rebecca now looked like a hot super model while Richard turned into a full-blown body builder.<br />
<br />
Their clothes changed, but it was completely different.  For Rebecca, her tube top and skirt start to grow out and the color started to turn white.  Both the bottom hem of her shit and top hem of her skirt join together and merged into on huge piece of cloth.  Straps grew back up around her shoulders, but kept the top hem exposed and showing her huge ample cleavage.  The straps soon extend to her neck and wrapped around it to form a chocker as a golden cross appeared on the front end.  Then a translucent fabric slowly appeared and game down her huge assets, creating floral designs on it.  The bottom hem of her former skirt extended downwards and went down to her feet, creating one huge tube.  That said tube has a split on the right side and it exposed her shapely leg.  That leg and the other had a translucent white stocking growing up her leg and reaching her thigh, connecting to her panties, which changed every time she aged.  Even her heel sandals closed up again and turned pearly white as her heel extended to another inch.  The fabric of her nearly created dress turned into solid silk and has a huge shine to it that can blind someone.  Her hair soon rearranged itself into a tight bun and a veil magically appeared, lifting up to reveal her face.  Even her makeup was elegant and thick eyelashes, blushing makeup, and ruby red lipstick and she’s smearing all over Richard’s face.  Speaking of him, his outfit made was serious changes compared to the last one.  While his tank top remained the same and has changed size to fit his building physique, multiple clothing started to appear behind him and floated towards him.  Rich, on instinct, got his arms off of her and brought them back, letting the clothes reach him.  The first is a white-buttoned shirt as the sleeves entered his arms and enclosed around his body.  Once it was joined, the buttons buttoned themselves and covered his top nicely.  The buttons on the sleeves connected and a pair of shiny cufflinks appeared and stapled around his wrists.  The bottom part of the shirt soon tucked itself down into his gem shorts, which led to another change.  Those shorts soon grew down to his legs and stopped at his feet.  The white stripe disappeared and the black remained unchanged.  Just the fabric morphed into more of a fancy looking look as a belt magically appeared and wrapped around his waste, tightening it completely.  His sneakers then changed the most as the patches of them were peeled away and disappeared completely.  The white of the sneaker darkened to black and the design became smooth and shiny with laces shrinking and almost merging to the tops of his shoes.  The white socks darkened to black and grew up his muscular legs, going up to his ankles.  The rest of the following clothing soon followed suit as a black vest came up his arms via sleeves and wrapped around his body with two of the buttons connected.  Finally, a black piece of fabric came around his neck and tied into a neat little bow tie as the collar of his white shirt folded.  And to top it off, a red rose grew out of the front pocket and bloomed, just like their relationship.  Once it was over, Richard moved his arms around Rebecca’s neck and kept on kissing even after the changes.<br />
<br />
Already, the two went from two kids to a newly married couple with Rebecca dressed in a rich and elegant wedding gown and Richard wearing an expensive tux.  Yet even after all of that, the two still kissed and having let go since.  And while they no longer did any foreplay or groping, they still passionately made love as they both had their lips locked and gently hugged each other.  And yet they still keep going as they left their wedding years behind and aged considerably as they entered their early thirties.<br />
<br />
With Richard, his body he worked on so hard started to age considerably.  His muscles started to weaken a little, but remained toned and bulging.  His chest started to get a little droopy but was still hard and flat.  And his stomach started to look a little round, but still kept his chiseled abs.  Even his face was starting to get rugged as creases appeared at the corner of his eyes and his beard started to show a few speckles of gray.  His full head of hair was starting to loose a few strands and the front slowly moved back to the sides and a small hall started to appear in the back end.  His tux, while remained the said, begins to alter.  It starts with the color as it brightened from black to brown.  The fabric became wool and the rose in the pocket shriveled up and died instantly.  The bow around his neck started to untie itself and extended downwards, re-tieing into a regular tie with the color also changing to brown.  And his shoes turned brown and changed designs, resulting in a pair of loafers.  Pretty soon, Richard became a professional businessman at the sweet age of thirty.<br />
<br />
For Rebecca, not much as changes as she reached the peak of womanhood.  But you know what they say.  When you reached the peak, you will go rock bottom.  And for Rebecca’s case, she was starting to go down to the descent.  The first signs of aging were becoming evident as faint lines started to appear around her eyes and mouth while her red hair was slowly loosing its luster.  The bun of her hair soon exploded and shrunk up to a short and curly mop, forcing the veil to fly away and vanished completely.  The rest of her body remained the same, but her breasts started to get softer and droop a little while her arms and legs tone was started to erode away.  But the one thing that happened the most was her stomach.  At first, it was toned and flat, showing what a female model should be like.  But now she felt something in her stomach and cringed a little.  But she didn’t let go of the kiss as the two kept locked on.  It was then that there was a small bump starting to grow in her stomach and were slowly bloating.  Going from days, to weeks, and then months, her belly grew and was the size of the watermelon.  This lead the wedding dress to get strained and was on the verge of breaking.  Fortunately for her, her attire altered to match her aging body and expanding stomach.  The white color soon darkened all the way back to black as the lower hem shrunk up back to below her knees and the split enclosed itself to cover her thigh.  The translucent fabric vanished to reveal her breasts yet again but the straps remained intact.  The fabric became more of a substance that stretches the dress as the round stomach slowly expanded to adjust with its size.  Her see through panties faded to a beige color and it was silky and smooth.  Her white heels darkened to black again and remained nice and shiny.  And to top it off, her chocker broke apart and the fabric started to become a golden chain while the cross remained the same.  It soon dangled downwards and stopped down her chest, with the cross nestled between her breasts.<br />
<br />
The two conitnued to kiss passionately, not realizing that they have grown up or the bump growing more and more.  But as they were in the zone, Rebecca soon felt something in his stomach and immediately let go of the kiss.  Cluthing her now nine month stomach, her face cringed and was in complete pain.  Richard notice it and checked to see if she&#39;s all right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun?&quot; he asked in his low and mature voice, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca could feel something leaking in her panties and said to him in a sultry, slightly Irish voice, &quot;O&#39; blimey!  The baby!  The baby is coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard soon realized it and said, &quot;Wait!  What?!  The baby is coming!  Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  It&#39;s coming now!  I told you that going to the park when I was expecting would be a bad idea!&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard got up and slowly lifted his wife up to get her out of the park.  &quot;C&#39;mon!  I have to take you to the hospital so call for an emergency delivery!  Just remember to breathe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how to breathe!  Just get me to the bloody hospital before the baby pops out in front of the public!&quot; she said in a panic.<br />
<br />
The two slowly headed to their car in order to leave the park and head straight to the hospital.  Katie watched them leave and didn&#39;t think that would happen.  &quot;Shit!  I didn&#39;t think they will age up to the point the baby will deliver.  Never thought this ring could be that powerful.  I really need to be careful with this thing.  The last thing I want is to have an immediate delivery.  Or worse...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked to the ring and the couple leaving and wondered what to do.</p>
