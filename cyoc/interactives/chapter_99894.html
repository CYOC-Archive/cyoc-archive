<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ollie, Justin, and Nevin played Transformers for a little while. Ollie pretended he was Optimus Prime and Nevin reluctantly pretended he was Megatron. They played for 20 minutes and Nevin started to really act and talk as if he was far younger. Ollie wasn't sure if he was just play acting like a kid to fit the role or if it was the magic of the ring. Justin started to think of ways he could get what he wanted.<br />
<br />
"Hey, Nevin?"<br />
<br />
"Yeah?"<br />
<br />
"Are you having fun?"<br />
<br />
"Yeah, this reminds me of when I was a kid way back when."<br />
<br />
"Well, do you want to play another game?"<br />
<br />
"What's that?"<br />
<br />
"WELL, if I was an adult, I could play with you like I was your daddy. I could take you down to the arcade and you could play games as a little kid!"<br />
<br />
Ollie froze. <br />
<br />
"Oh, I could never allow that. No, that would be far too dangerous! What if something happened to me or Ollie?"<br />
<br />
"What do you mean? It's just the arcade! Don't be such a baby, Nevin. It would be fun!"<br />
<br />
Ollie noticed that the effects of the ring were working on Nevin fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
"I am not a baby! I am a grown up!"<br />
<br />
"I know that!" Justin coaxed him. "I'm your friend. I just wanna make sure you have fun tonight. We could stay at home or we could go out? But you can't go out with you being a kid and us bein' kids, too. We would need a grown up with us."<br />
<br />
"I dunno...maybe we should stay home."<br />
<br />
"And do what? Just watch TV or play video games? We can do that anytime. You have a magic ring! You should have fun! It would be way more fun at the arcade. And they're open late on Friday!"<br />
<br />
"I guess it would be fun, but...if you get to be a grown up for the night, who would you be?"<br />
<br />
"Well I have some of my dad's mittens upstairs. But he lives across the street and if he sees himself walking around outside then we'll get caught. So, I guess I'd have to go as you as a grown up."<br />
<br />
"But I'm me as a kid."<br />
<br />
"Do you wanna switch? I'll give you my clothes and you can be me! You'll be the same age but I'm a little bit bigger than you. See?"<br />
<br />
Justin had them compare heights. It was true. Justin was a full two inches taller! Wow, I could be two inches taller, Nevin thought jealously.<br />
<br />
"So what do you say, buddy?" Justin said. "Just for one night? You can be me and have a lot of fun and I'll take you guys down there. It will be like playing House and I can take care of you!"<br />
<br />
"Okay! This'll be real fun!" <br />
<br />
"Are we really going to the arcade?" Ollie said. <br />
<br />
"Yeah, it'll be a blast." Justin said. <br />
<br />
"Okay, but you can't act like a bad dad. If you are dad for the night you have to be a really nice, really good daddy." Ollie told him. "You have to promise."<br />
<br />
"I promise I will be! I will be the nicest daddy in the world." Justin said, making a very convincing presentation.<br />
<br />
"Okay, here's jacket and underwear. You have to take off your clothes for it to work."<br />
<br />
"Here ya go," Justin said, handing Nevin his shirt, pants, underoos. "You can be me now!"<br />
<br />
"Cool!" Nevin said. Ollie watched with interest as Nevin put on a flannel shirt that draped over him, the sleeves touched the ground and the boxer briefs, which he had never worn before were far too big for his waist, so he had to hold them up. Ollie was a little bit worried things would go wrong like they did before with his now-brothers who went crazy with power when they became adult versions of himself. <br />
<br />
"I'll go first," Nevin said, and let the ring work its magic. His new clothes fit him perfectly, and he grew a few inches before stopping. He was now a puny 9 year old instead of a puny 8 year old, with much shorter blond hair.<br />
<br />
"Now me! I look kind of silly like this!" Justin said. Justin held out his hand eagerly and took the ring from his now double. Justin didn't feel anything at first and wondered if it was even working but then just as if someone had put him on an elevator he felt like he was rising. He saw Ollie and Nevin and he rose til he was a full head taller than them! Then two heads. He watched his legs get longer. He felt his arms increasing in length and soon they were at the elbow seams of the shirt. "No way!" he said, his voice cracking.<br />
<br />
"I think you're a teenager now!" Ollie said. <br />
<br />
Justin wanted to watch himself in a mirror but he didn't dare move lest the underwear fall off. So he held onto them. Until...they fit? Suddenly testicles dropped and it was like two golf balls passed from inside his body down to hand under his crotch and his penis tripled in length until it bulged against his new boxers. <br />
<br />
"Wow. Wow! This is so cool. My voice! I sound like my older brother!" His voice was deeper and he looked around as the room shrunk, first by one foot, then two...finally he reached the height of 6'4" and marveled as hair sprouted from his crotch, then his legs like a bunch of ants running all over as it grew in fast forward, armpits sprouted hair like small plants and stubble coated his face. His chest was last. He could see the hair growing in as his shirt was not buttoned. He nearly laughed and cried out with joy but he was so frozen with delight. His hands slipped past the cuffs to fill out the shirt and he wriggled them around.<br />
<br />
"is...is that it?" the now middle aged Justin said, looking like a copy of middle aged Nevin.<br />
<br />
"Wow! I sure look different from way down here! I forgot what it's like to be a kid looking up at people," i guess. the original Nevin said. "We should go by our real names, by the way. I'm still Nevin even though I'm little and you're still Justin, even though you're big."<br />
<br />
"I know my name, I'm not a baby," Justin said, dismissively before catching sight of himself in a small circular mirror and a smile waved over his face. He ran to the bathroom with no pants on. "WOW!" They heard fro the bathroom. "My penis is so big now!"<br />
<br />
"Uh, you should get some pants on, sweetheart." Nevin said getting his slacks and going to the bathroom door. Justin was looking at his new dick and rubbing his chest hair in the mirror, then his face stubble. I guess it's a lot for a kid like him to take in, Nevin thought. "Here are your grown up pants."<br />
<br />
"Cool! Hey, your wallet! Neat! I have money!"<br />
<br />
"Yeah, but you only use that when I tell you to, okay?"<br />
<br />
Justin smiled convincingly. "Oh, okay. So are you boys ready to get out of here?"<br />
<br />
"Yeah!" Ollie said. "Come on, let's get our shoes on!"<br />
<br />
When they came downstairs, they saw Nevin had taken his pants off again and was sitting in a daze, wearing one of Nevn's caps. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"Hey, buddy. Did you change underwear?" Nevin asked.<br />
<br />
"Oh, sorry. I found it on your couch and thought it looked cool. And then when I put it on I felt funny. My penis got really hard when I looked at the girls in this magazine. They're...hot!"<br />
<br />
Nevin took the Sports Illustrated away from the boy turned man gngerly. "Hey, you promised to take us to the arcade, remember?"<br />
<br />
"Oh yeah! I guess I better but uh...wait how do we get there? It's kind of far. Can I drive your car?" the grown man asked the child. <br />
<br />
"NO! Don't do that, you'll wreck it!"<br />
<br />
"No I won't! I can be a good driver, I watched my dad plenty of times. He let's me sit in front!"<br />
<br />
"Okay. Look. I have a plan. Just call us a cab and we'll take that over, okay?"<br />
<br />
"Okay," Justin said sadly, relenting. <br />
<br />
"And put your pants back on, buddy! Can't have you going around looking like that!"<br />
<br />
The boys were really excited as they piled into the cab. Justin was excited he got to give money to the cab driver ALL BY HIMSELF! He felt so in charge! He got to have his own cel phone and he had a grown up wallet! This was so cool! He got outside the cab when they arrived and looked around, and everything was so...different being tall. He was looking down at everything that he used to have to look up to! Being a grown up is cool! he thought. <br />
<br />
"Justin paid the man at the counter so the boys and he could play the arcades together. The cashier was shorter than him now! He smiled widely. This guy was also probably younger than me now, he thought. This was absolutely the best night of Justin's life. He played a few games and had a lot of fun. <br />
<br />
"Nevin? That you, buddy?" Justin stopped. Was someone talking to him? The man standing right next to him looked familiar. It was one of Daddy's friends! A lot of the dads of his friends were also friends. <br />
<br />
"Oh, hi Mr. Peters!"<br />
<br />
"Mr. Peters? Are you high right now?"<br />
<br />
"Yeah, I'm totally tall!"<br />
<br />
"Rub it in, rub it in. Hey you wanna beer? Jack and me were just watching the game while our kids go nuts. I love this place, you can just leave the kids to do their thing and we can do ours. You hungry? We got some pizza?"<br />
<br />
"You want me to have a BEER?" Justin smiled. He could hardly wait! What else could he do, he wondered.</p>
