<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bets had bid her friends good day with a simple, &quot;See you all later,&quot; and not even paying attention to the odd sensation in her groin, she headed for her car, thinking of how she would first meet up with April at the mall around seven and go over to Chastity's house shortly after.<br />
<br />
Sitting down in her car, she adjusted her position, thinking that it was suddenly odd how uncomfortable she felt and shrugging it off as 'one of those feminine times' she started the car and began to drive, setting into a slightly slouched position, her legs spread, something she would of thought was unlady-like and that only a boy would sit like she was had she been giving it any thought.<br />
<br />
Instead, she was thinking about several different things and not settling on one particular item at the moment. Driving, she felt a sort of freedom that came with the responsibility and did not really want to go home. Instead, what she really wanted to do was to go to the local bar and put back a couple brewskies with the boys, something that she thought was odd and should be wrong, but also had a certain level of comfort to it so that in the long run, she did not give a second thought to.<br />
<br />
Turning a corner, Bets wondered where a good place to get a beer was and cruising along, gazing at the bars as she drove past, she slowed her car when she spied a department store selling hunting gear and finding a parking spot, she exited her car and headed for the store, the idea of hunting seeming more interesting at the moment then getting a drink.<br />
<br />
Inside, Bets noted the cool atmosphere and the lack of any store clerk, thought that they must be in back and shrugging off the oddity of the lack of any cameras and the feeling in her groin, which was slowly growing, she started for the section of the store with the hunting gear.<br />
<br />
Quickly locating it, she was about to begin her perusal with the different shotguns offered, but switched course when she saw the statues of several deer set up near a pup-tent. Approaching, not giving it a second thought, she began to lovingly caress the rear of the doe of the group while rubbing the front of her pants as she did so, her mind drifting as she began to think of some real randy things she would do to the deer if it was alive.<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, thinking, &quot;What the...&quot; she stepped away from the statue and hastily looking about to see if anybody had noticed her, she blushed and almost turned away.<br />
<br />
But then she saw the book lying on the table with a couple deer on the front and picking it up, Bets began to idly flip through it, skipping the parts that showed the field-dressed kills and stopping on the couple of pages that showed does. Again, her hand slipped down to the front part of her pants and rubbing herself, the sensation in her groin growing, Bets looked about in a guilty manner and spying the tent, she ducked in, zipped up the front and lying down on the model sleeping bag, she continued her readings.<br />
<br />
After a about fifteen minutes, and still no sign of the floor clerk who was busy closing up for the day and did not know, nor would he realise, that there was still somebody in the store, Bets slowly began to undo the four buttons on the front of her pants and after pushing both her pants and underwear down a bit, she began to rub her clit as she looked at the book.<br />
<br />
Stopping for a moment when it became apparent that something was off, she looked past the book and down at her groin, the sensation growing even more to the point that she thought she was about to burst, Bets let out a snort and licked her upper lip as she touched herself, exploring the area between her legs. And when nothing seemed out of place, even though it was clear that she no longer had a vagina opening and that her clitoris and urethra had merged together and where poking out past her clitoris hood, Bets gave another snort and licking her upper lip, turned her attention back to the book, finding that she liked the pictures that showed the anatomy of the female deer the best.<br />
<br />
As she lay in the pup-tent, pleasuring herself to pictures of does, the clerk of the store took one final look about and seeing nothing out of place and no lingering customers, he headed for the back and clicked off the main room lights and exited through the back of the store, his mind on getting home to his wife as he locked up, but forgot to set the alarm.<br />
<br />
Bets, still lying in the tent, received a nasty jolt of reality the moment the lights in the store went off and giving another snort, she looked wildly about the tent and asked herself, &quot;What the hell am I doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to answer this, she tossed aside the book and sitting up, she started to reach for her pants to pull them up, but instead flopped back down and nearly passed out as the sensation in her groin suddenly built to a point that she thought she would either pass out or explode and with an audible 'pop' Bets felt a moment of release as the cramps  in her groin area and the pins and needles sensation in her upper legs suddenly abated and lying there, feeling suddenly tranquil, Bets realised that she really did not want to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Rolling over on her side, she looked at the side of the pup-tent, thinking over everything, attempting to come up with a reason as to why she suddenly felt that she should be here. After a moment, unable to come up with a reason, she rolled back over onto her back and sat up to pull her underwear and pants, but stopped when she saw that her groin was clearly different.<br />
<br />
Scared, Bets tried to come to terms with what she was seeing and touching the new area, realising that the sack hanging just below it was clearly a pair of testicles, she gave another snort and licking her upper lip, she gently pressed on the area until the red tip of what was clearly a penis began to slid out of the penis sheath. Tearing her hands away, terrified beyond belief, Bets looked wildly about and after a moment, struggled into a kneeling position and walking on her knees to the zipped-opening of the tents, she undid the zipper and crawled out.<br />
<br />
Standing, looking down in the poor light cast from the emergency lights left on at night, Bets thought that it wasn't just the fact that she now clearly had a penis and testicles, but something about her pubic hair appeared off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; she told herself as she struggled to pull up her pants, finding that wearing pants and underwear clearly meant for a girl was suddenly uncomfortable when the person in question had a penis and set of testicles, Bets mentally shrugged it off and told herself, &quot;It is not true. It is not possible for girl to grow something like that,&quot; and giving another snort, she licked her lip and did up her pants and underwear as best as possible.<br />
<br />
Casting about for a way out, she finally settled on the back door, her pants and underwear feeling tight and clearly showing a bulge that no girl should have, Bets slipped quietly through the store, forgetting that was leaving her purse, which contained her house and car keys, back in the tent as she moved.<br />
<br />
As she reached the back area of the store, she paused for a moment, worried about alarms, but in the end shrugged it off and thinking, &quot;Come what may,&quot; she slipped out the back door and into an alley. As the door closed and locked behind her, she suddenly remembered her purse and with a soft cry of, &quot;No,&quot; she turned around to catch the door, but stopping before she found her fingers pinched in the door jam, her mind taking on strange feeling of being tranquil.<br />
<br />
Giving another snort, Bets turned away from the store, figuring that her purse was not important at the moment, and taking a look up and down the alley, she selected a direction and began to walk, forgetting for the moment her car was in the opposite direction.</p>
