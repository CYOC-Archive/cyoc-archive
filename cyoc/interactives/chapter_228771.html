<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff knew almost next to nothing about dogs. He knew there were small, yappy ones, which he no longer believed he was becoming, and there were larger ones, which had a deep, booming bark to them. Finally extricating himself from other dog, torn between liking what he&#39;d experienced and shocked by the sensation of experiencing sex from a female&#39;s point of view, he got himself a right proper look at the dog. Watching as the canine approached him, Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what breed it was. Lifting a hind leg as the male thrust its muzzle betwixt his legs, and began to sniff and lick his vulva, Jeff thought it could be the same breed except for how it was lower to the ground, a smidge longer, and its skin seemed rather baggy.<br />
<br />
Curious to know what breed he was becoming, and what breed he&#39;d been mounted by, the next thing which crossed Jeff&#39;s mind was whether he would now become pregnant. Terrified by the thought at first, he thrust his newly formed muzzle under the other dog, and as the male continued to sniff and lick Jeff&#39;s privates, Jeff set to work licking and cleaning the male’s still exposed penis. The part of him that was still very much male, and human, found the act repulsive, and rather inappropriate, whilst the part of him which very much a bitch not only didn&#39;t see any problem, but also seemed to see it as something which needed attending, and unsure which to go by, in the end, Jeff gave himself over to being Nikki for the for moment. Trying hard not to give any sort of thought to what it was he was doing, Jeff instead wondered how much of his head had changed.<br />
<br />
It was clear his face now pushed outward in what was obviously the muzzle of a canine. What Jeff didn&#39;t know was if anything else of his head had transformed. Did it now look fully like a dog&#39;s head, or was it weird sort of mash-up between what he used to be and what he was now more of? Wanting a mirror more than anything, Jeff ran his tongue down the male&#39;s shaft, over the sheath, and across fur-covered testicles. Finding it was causing an unknown feeling to creep over him, which was amplified by the attention the male was giving him, he was momentarily distracted from his musing. Wondering if what he was doing, and having done to him, was turning him on again, he became worried it might lead to him being mounted again. Wanting to stop, but finding the part of him that was firmly Nikki wouldn&#39;t, he submitted for the moment, and discovered it wasn’t so much arousal, but more a sense of euphoria, bliss, acceptance, submission, and general form of greeting, being accepted, and shared friendliness betwixt two canines.<br />
<br />
Not sure how such an action was able to generate such a mix of reactions, Jeff resisted the urge to shake his head in confusion. Completing his ministrations, and finding the male was also finishing, Jeff lowered his hind leg and looked about. Still unsure where exactly he was, he whimpered deep in his throat, a response which caused the other dog to huddle close and make a noise which was almost as to say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m here with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, he wasn’t sure how, Jeff found himself comforted by not only the sound, but also the nonverbal cues the other dog was sending. Relaxed, he glanced about, and with a fresh eye, took a look at his surroundings. Seeing everything from the perspective of being lower to the ground, smaller than he&#39;d been as a teenage human, he found it hard to determine where exactly he was. He found himself believing more so he wasn&#39;t in the park, especially when he breathed in through his nostrils and took in the scents which flood his brain with a plethora of sensory information.  Glancing over at the male, wondering how best to communicate he needed help finding his way home, he listened as the dog barked, and before he stop help himself, Nikki reasserted herself with a lunge, and Jeff found himself racing after the other dog as they began to play and explore their surroundings, as well as each other.<br />
<br />
When they grew tired of this, Nikki took the cue to lead the way and they left what, had he even been there, Jeff would have been surprised to learn was the actually the furthest end of the park. Both male basset and female beagle followed their nose, and instincts, as they wandered through the neighbourhoods. When they grew hungry, they located an upset trash bin, to which each in turn nosed their way inward and explored the contents, ferreting out bits of whatnot to eat. The female dog he almost complete was refusing to relinquish her control, Jeff found he didn&#39;t mind, as the idea of being outside, away from the safety and comfort of his backyard and house, plus the idea of eating from a trash bin, overwhelming and rather frightening. Finding the bitch he was becoming had the better mindset for everything, he made no attempt to come forward and assert any form of control. Taking a sort of backseat to everything, he observed and noted how both he and the other dog behaved, especially when they&#39;d had their fill of the contents of the bin, something Jeff was still conflicted about, they began to roam.<br />
<br />
Aimless in their direction, neither Nikki nor the male dog seemed to have any set goal of where they were going. This surprising Jeff, it took him a moment before he worked out he was still trying to apply the way he viewed things as human to the way he now viewed the world as a female dog. Finding he didn&#39;t know when the change had happened, curious to know if it had been gradual or sudden, he approached the back of a vehicle. Stopped to sniff at the auto, noting how big the thing now was in comparison to him, Jeff leapt up into the back of the open area. Hearing the male following, he continued to sniff about as he moved amongst the items inside. Edging toward the front of the area, Jeff found the dark area comforting and yawning, he lay down. Sensing more than seeing the male doing the same, he inched closer until he and the male were snuggled together, finding the presence of the other animal soothing, he closed his eyes. Drifting to sleep, he wondered how he was to get home, and whether the male had an owner who might miss him, and what said owner would do if Jeff followed the other dog home. Drowsing, he figured it&#39;d have to be something which would have to be dealt with whenever the point came up.<br />
<br />
Movement jarred him awake, and for a moment, Jeff felt certain this was what had awoken him. Looking about in the dark, able to tell from the smell of things the opening he and the other had come through was now closed, as the area lacked the almost fresh quality of openness, it came as a start when he realised what had awoken him was the buzzy, tingling sensation in his female privates and the itch coming from his ears. Whimpering, &quot;No, not now,&quot; he sensed the other dog stir.<br />
<br />
Fearful of what might happen if he remained where he was, Jeff wasn&#39;t sure what to do. Using a hindleg to scratch at his ear, he found he would have been relieved to know it was still a human ear if weren&#39;t for the fact he knew he was going through another transformation. Whimpering again, the itch growing worse, he continued to work the ear, and when it didn&#39;t offer any relief, he switched sides, found it still did nothing, stood, and started to pace about. His motions getting to the other dog, Jeff wanted to pull away from him when he stood and drew closer, but finding Nikki had other ideas, he found he couldn&#39;t move as the male started to first lick one ear, then the other.<br />
<br />
The sensation of having a dog lick his ears was strange at first. But, the longer it went on, the more Jeff found it enjoyable, as well as it setting off more of the nonverbal cues he was getting used to giving and receiving. Feeling his ears change with each pass the male made with his tongue, Jeff wished there was a way to make it stop, as he didn&#39;t want to transform any more, yet, at the same time, discovered it was a welcome distraction from his vulva, teats, and other parts of his female body which indicated he was feeling randy. Squeezing his eyes shut, missing the way his mind slipping downward and the part of him which was Nikki again took control, Jeff started to pant and when the male paused, he used his tongue to lick the other dog. Sending several levels of communication, the basset didn&#39;t need a second invitation on what he was to do when the female dog before him shifted in place and positioned herself.<br />
<br />
Muzzle thrust into her privates, he used it to first sniff, then nuzzle her, all before giving it a series of licks. Nikki giving cues she was receptive, wanting what the male could offer to sooth her for the moment, the male reciprocated by mountig her and began to thrust. Feeling this, Jeff suddenly became aware of where he was, who he was with, and what was about to happen. Both wanting and not wanting what was about to happen, he froze in place, unsure what to do, which allowed for the female part of him to position herself better. Feeling there was nothing he could do, terrified once more by the notion of becoming pregnant, Jeff did the only thing he saw he could do - gave himself over to the bliss of being mounted by a male dog like the bitch in heat he was becoming as his ears finished morphing to the floppy ears of a beagle and fur, coloured the same as what was over his muzzle and body, grew over them, all whilst his eyes shifted shading to a more brown hue.</p>
