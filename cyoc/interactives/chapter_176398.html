<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A series of hisses and growls echoed around the building as Vicky reached into the cage in front of her and pulled out a pair of panicking otters; one male and the other female. The two terrified creatures did their best to swipe at Vicky and nip at her with their teeth. Regrettably though, Vicky had enough strength and experience to keep the two animals under control. She gradually increased her grip as she held the couple by their necks; meaning that their protests quickly faltered as their bodies went limp in her hands.<br />
<br />
“There we are,” Vicky chuckled, “after all these years I thought you might have learned how futile it is to resist me.” The two otters shot each other a worried look, after which they turned to you with expressions of regret etched across their furry faces. Staring back at them, you felt a pit in your stomach as you immediately realised that both were once human like you.<br />
<br />
“Well Princess,” Vicky continued, “say hello to Joe and Lucy, aren’t they cute?” All you could manage in reply was a gentle snort as you continued to feel sorry for the two horrified otters in front of you. “Yes, I have grown rather fond of them over the years. I like the fact that they both still have a lot of spirit left in them, which makes it all the more fun when they submit to my will.” The two otters both looked up and were met with a sadistic, threatening glare from their captor. Clearly they had been in this situation many times before if they really had been locked in here for a number of years. You felt increasingly sick inside as you could only imagine what it would be like to be trapped in here for such a long time.<br />
<br />
You continued to think about this as Vicky placed the two otters down on a nearby table. “Now don’t you two try anything,” she said whilst pointing at them, “if you do then both of you will be punished.” The two otters looked at each other for a second, almost as if they were considering making a run for it. However, after a small exchange of chirps and grunts the couple both reluctantly slumped down onto their bellies as they waited for Vicky to carry on with her performance. <br />
<br />
“See,” Vicky said with a smile, “they always see sense in the end. Now, wait here while I fetch one more of my little pets.” Upon hearing this the two otters cried out in dismay, apparently knowing something you didn’t. However, Vicky simply smiled as she sauntered back over to the animals that were stacked-up against the wall. There, she carefully extracted a heavy, water-filled tank full of about a dozen silvery-blue fish.<br />
<br />
The otters continued to cry out in protest as the fishtank was brought over to them. Inside, the fish were all swimming around in fear as Vicky’s intimidating form loomed large above them. <br />
<br />
“There we are,” Vicky said with a grunt as she put the heavy tank down beside the two otters, “now I can finally set about explaining how Joe and Lucy came to be in my possession. Well, this story takes place about five years ago, back when Coleson’s Chemical Co. was still in business. You see, the farm lies downstream from where the company’s old head-factory used to be located. Sadly, as a result of many negligent and outright illegal practices, the amount of toxic waste entering the river soon turned it into a clouded ooze of pure poison. My parents tried to inform the authorities but they seemed completely disinterested. That was why, when several of our prized cattle died from drinking the river’s fowl water, we decided to take matters into our own hands.”<br />
<br />
Vicky briefly paused at this juncture. She smiled down at the two otters as they shook in abstract terror, after which she turned her attention to the nearby fish tank. “To that end,” Vicky continued, “we decided to pay the illustrious Charles Coleson a little visit.” With that, Vicky lifted the top of the fish tank and looked at the swimming fish like a hungry predator. Then, her hand suddenly darted into the water as Vicky snatched up the fish she was looking for. “And here he is,” Vicky said as the fish wriggled around desperately in her hands, “this was once the mighty Mr Coleson. Oh and I ought to point out that Charles’ species wasn’t all that was altered; now you are actually looking at Charlotte, our favourite female salmon!”<br />
<br />
Vicky chuckled as the two otters both cried out in dismay. Meanwhile, the squirming fish continued to flop around in panic as it naturally wanted to return to the water. Sadly though, Vicky wasn’t prepared to let the former factory owner off the hook that easily. Instead, she brought the gasping fish over to where the otters were positioned. Then, in one fluid motion, Vicky grabbed Lucy by the scruff of her neck and held her up for you to see.<br />
<br />
“Of course, my parents and I are not completely soulless” Vicky continued with a sinister grin, “that’s why we decided to let Charlotte remain with her family. Hence, her wife Johanna and her son Luke became the two adorable otters you see before you, although you may have worked out that they too had a few anatomical changes to get used to!” The two otters groaned upon being reminded of both their loss of humanity and their change of gender. Meanwhile, you felt your body tense up and your mind start to race as your tail settled over your own transformed genitalia.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” you heard Vicky say a short while later as you woke up from your momentary trance, “let’s get this family reunion off the ground shall we?” <br />
<br />
With that, Vicky suddenly forced the startled fish towards the equally-startled otter. Then, there was an ear-splitting screech as the fish made contact with the otter’s furry body. From your close-up vantage point you could clearly see what was happening in gruesome detail. There, nestled between Lucy’s furry legs was her tight pink pussy. However, what was even worse was that the small slit was now being kissed by the wet, slippery tip of Charlotte’s snout. Regrettably though, Vicky showed no remorse as she increased the pressure, causing Lucy’s folds to buckle and split open as several inches of slippery salmon was slowly forced inside.<br />
<br />
Lucy continued to cry out as more of her father’s streamlined body slid inside her moist feminine slit. Alongside this, the sensations were only made worse by the fish’s constant struggling. Having the salmon squirming around inside her meant that the fish’s fins and scales were constantly rubbing and grinding over different areas of her sensitive vaginal passage.<br />
<br />
Vicky continued to press the fish inwards until she was left holding her by the tail. Now Lucy was able to feel all but a few inches of the salmon squirming around inside her as the fish desperately struggled to breath whilst out of the water. However, Vicky seemed to know how long Charlotte would be able to last as she casually held her in place, allowing her to explore her former-son’s warm, moist depths as she moved around inside.<br />
<br />
As things continued, it was soon clear that Lucy was struggling to keep her composure. She had inadvertently started to jerk and roll her hips forward as she squirmed around in Vicky’s arms. The grimace on the otter’s face told you that she didn’t really want to enjoy this disgusting act. And yet, her hot, panting moans and shivers of desire told a different story. Clearly, Lucy’s body craved this attention as it shuddered and shook in barely-contained arousal.<br />
<br />
Worryingly though, it was soon clear that you weren’t the only one to have noticed this reaction. Vicky chuckled before she suddenly pulled back hard on the salmon’s tail. Lucy cried out in shock as the fish’s fins and scales roughly raked over her inner walls on the way out. She was then left panting as Vicky carried Charlotte back over to the fish tank.<br />
<br />
For a fleeting moment you thought that might be it. However, after only a quick dunk in the tank to let Charlotte catch her breath, Vicky once again brought the fish out of the water and moved her back over to the stunned otter. Lucy groaned as the wet, dripping tip of the fish’s snout pressed between her legs again. This time though, Vicky decided to take things to the next level. Lucy once again cried out in denial and unwanted pleasure as Vicky roughly forced the front half of the fish straight back into her quivering vagina. Then, Vicky proceeded to pull Charlotte out slightly before pushing her in again. And before long, the helpless salmon was being used like a wet, slimy dildo as she was stuffed into the female’s passage again and again.<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” Vicky said as she smiled at the squirming otter in her hand, “you like that, don’t you girl?” The former-man only managed a weak breathless moan in reply as the fish continued to move in and out of her. “You and your father were both so upset when we took your disgusting human dicks away from you. Now though, I think you finally realise that this was a blessing rather than a curse. I mean, just look how hot and slick your new pussy has become… just look at your father.”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she briefly withdrew the terrified salmon. You and Lucy could only watch in dismay as most of the fish’s body was now covered in thick, sticky fluid. Moreover, when you turned back to the stunned otter, you were treated to a shot of her pussy lips partly stretched open and the image of more lubrication steadily oozing out from the depths of her vaginal passage.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” I think that’s enough of that for the moment, “now I think it’s Joe’s turn to have some fun.” With that Vicky gently placed the panting Lucy back on the table, after which she deftly grabbed Joe with a swoop of her arm. “Now then dear, this wouldn’t be a proper family reunion if you didn’t get in on the fun.”<br />
<br />
The otter was about to cry out in protest but was interrupted when Vicky forced the struggling salmon straight into his mouth. Joe coughed and spluttered loudly as he was made to taste his former-son’s lubrication. The gooey liquid steadily coated the otter’s mouth as the fish wriggled and squirmed inside. <br />
<br />
After a minute of this, it soon became clear what Vicky was trying to do. “Haha,” she chuckled as she stared at the startled male otter, “it seems you like your daughter’s sweet taste. Mmmm… yes, I can see your animal instincts starting to take over. Don’t worry, I will let you satisfy them all in due course.”<br />
<br />
Vicky maintained her sinister smile as she removed Charlotte and returned her to her tank for another quick breather. However, you were now more focused on the fish’s former-wife. Now, peaking between Joe’s furry legs was a very obvious erection, which now bobbed eagerly as he looked at the other otter hungrily. Lucy clearly noticed this as she chirped and cried out to try and snap her mother out of it. Sadly though, Joe seemed to take no notice as he scrabbled to get free of Vicky’s grip.<br />
<br />
“Calm, calm dear,” Vicky whispered to the horny otter in her hand, “you will be with your daughter again soon enough. First though, we need to make sure that you are fully ready to satisfy her.”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky removed Charlotte from the fish tank and in one fluid motion brought her straight into contact with Joe’s throbbing penis. The gasping fish was clearly not prepared for this as several inches of her wife’s shaft was suddenly forced into her agape mouth. Joe meanwhile was also startled by this development as he got to feel the fish’s slimy maw quickly engulfing his stiff otter cock.<br />
<br />
With Charlotte now in position, Vicky held her in place for a few seconds before she moved her back up Joe’s shaft. Then, the fish gave a muffled choke as she was forced back down over the dick in her mouth. And after that, Vicky pulled back once again, meaning that she quickly built into a steady rhythm of working Charlotte up and down over his wife’s twitching length.<br />
<br />
Things continued like this for a short while, with the otter jerking and growling in need as the fish moved up and down over his now fully-erect penis. Now, the male otter’s gaze remained transfixed on his female counterpart as the pheromones from her lubrication still hung heavily on his taste buds. Now it was painfully clear what he wanted as he looked at Lucy with a glazed-over expression and with a slight bit of drool spilling from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” Vicky said upon noticing this reaction, “I think that ought to do the trick.” With that, Vicky pulled the salmon off the excited otter as she lowered him down onto the table where Lucy was positioned. As soon as Vicky let him go, Joe immediately began to stalk towards his former-son with a predatory look in his eyes. As he did this the sight of the rock-hard, drooling cock that hung beneath him served to remind everyone what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Upon noticing this, Lucy immediately made to turn and scurry away. However, Vicky seemed to anticipate this move as she darted forward and pinned the female down by the scruff of her neck. Lucy was clearly horrified by this as she scratched and scrabbled against the table. Sadly though, Vicky only tightened her grip in the face of these protests. This caused Lucy to cry out again; that is, until she felt a large shadow looming over her…<br />
<br />
Lucy cried out in dismay as Joe’s claws dug into her sides and his teeth clamped down near where Vicky was holding her. The startled otter tried to buck the male of her back, but was sadly unable as he only tightened his grip in reply. Soon, Vicky felt confident that she could let go of her terrified victim, now that the male seemed to have her firmly under his control.<br />
<br />
“That’s it Joe,” Vicky said encouragingly, “give your daughter what she really wants!” <br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, Lucy seemed to redouble her efforts to escape. However, her horror was then vocalised with an ear-splitting cry as Joe’s penis finally pressed inside her furry folds. Following this development, a series of dismayed groans and grunts started to echo around the building as Joe got to work humping away at his former-son’s tight pink pussy.<br />
<br />
Vicky laughed as she saw the look of wide-eyed horror etched across Lucy’s face. Meanwhile, you felt sick to your stomach as you reflected on all you had witnessed over the last few minutes. Moreover, knowing that the animals were all related, and that they had been trapped in here for years already, only made things even more disturbing as you now watched mother and son fucking passionately in their new animal bodies.<br />
<br />
As this sick act continued, Vicky made sure that Charlotte had a good view of the action. She therefore pressed the struggling salmon underneath the two mating otters, thus providing her with a close-up view of her wife’s dick spreading her son’s pussy wide as it sank inside. In the meantime, you also noticed that Lucy’s resistance was beginning to dwindle to nothing. Instead, you saw a lustful hunger, similar to that shown by her mother, starting to settle over her furry face. Soon, her groans of dismay had given way to cries of delight as her natural mating instincts started to take control.<br />
<br />
“That’s it,” Vicky said to the whole family, “this little reunion has been a blast. Now then I think it’s about time for the grand finale…”<br />
<br />
Joe seemed to get this hint as he started to work at a fever pitch. Meanwhile Lucy, who by now had fully given in to her body’s urges, found herself pressing back against him; ensuring that his rigid penis slipped into the deepest recesses of her stuffed vaginal channel. As for Charlotte, she could do little more than wriggle around uselessly as she was made to witness the thumping movements of the two otters getting wilder and wilder.<br />
<br />
Then, with a pair of piercing cries, the mating finally came to an end as both otters climaxed in unison. From where you were standing, you thankfully couldn’t see too many of the grizzly details as Joe ejaculated hard into his mate’s eager folds. However, you weren’t able to avoid the look of utter bliss spread across Lucy’s face as she huffed and jerked in time with each jet of semen that was fired into her.<br />
<br />
With the otters both seemingly satisfied, Vicky finally withdrew Charlotte from underneath the couple so that she could address him directly. “There, that should serve as a reminder of what happens when you cross me or my family. Now, after that I think you have some breeding of your own to be getting on with!”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky slowly walked over to the large fish tank and opened the lid. Then, after locking eyes with the terrified fish for a few seconds, Vicky unceremoniously dropped the helpless salmon back into the water. Then, she promptly sealed the tank shut and left Charlotte to her own devices.<br />
<br />
Immediately, you noticed that several fish seemed to be almost following Charlotte as she swam away in a panic. Knowing Vicky, you already knew what was in store for the former factory-owner as she quickly got surrounded amongst the mass of lively salmon.<br />
<br />
You continued to watch this until a series of tired squeaks rang out from nearby. You turned to see Vicky now carrying both otters back towards their own cage. Both animals were clearly still dazed from their passionate sex as they half-heartedly pawed at Vicky’s hands. However, this only made the cruel woman smile as she looked down at the two helpless animals in her hands.<br />
<br />
Vicky continued to stare at her pets evilly as she carefully returned them to their wire cage. Following this, Vicky proceeded to place the caged otters and the tank full of salmon back amongst the other animals.<br />
<br />
And so, with her story having now reached its cruel conclusion, Vicky left the Coleson family to it as she declared that it was time for another story. With this in mind she began pacing around the small building as she started hunting for her next victim.<br />
<br />
After inspecting a few of the various cages and glass tanks Vicky seemed to have made her selection. Meanwhile you could only watch in stunned silence as Vicky reached into one of the containers and introduced you to yet another one of her family’s unfortunate victims...</p>
