<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Morgana turned into a toilet the Soldiers turned on us. Maedel, Arn and I were quickly thrown into a <br />
dungeon so the wedding could proceed. All there was in the room was a bed and a single pot to piss in. through <br />
the bars to the outside we could see the street outside, albeit, our view was from ground level as our cell <br />
was in the basement. I saw the Wedding finish and Mother and the King, Father in law I supposed, leave looking <br />
delighted. The King glanced and pointed in our direction as he said something to a guard and soon the guard <br />
had come to visit us. He was carrying Morgana the toilet and plopped her down in our cell. The sound of water <br />
sloshing in the bowl, her mouth, as he did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;The King says a chamber pot is un-befitting of a Princess&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Our hands and feet shackled we made no attempt to escape. I felt sorry for Morgana and hoped Mother would let <br />
us out of this prison soon. I knew we'd be staying at least over night though as the King and Queen enjoyed <br />
their wedding night. I lifted Morgana's toilet lid. Her eyes staring up at me from their place painted on the <br />
lid. She blinked and her painted nose seemed to inhale and exhale as normal. It was quite obvious she was <br />
aware of her situation, I just hoped her other senses weren't still functioning.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's your own fault,&quot; Maedel accused Morgana, she sat there unable to respond except for a few bubble popping <br />
up to the surface in her bowl, &quot;Now neither of us will be able to change back! And a toilet? Really? That's <br />
cruel even for you! No wander karma had it turn back on you. To think I was about to dive at you to push you <br />
out the way. I'm glad I didn't or I might now be a toilet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thar's enough, Maedel. I'm sure I can convince mother to free us and we can change back. It just might take a <br />
while...&quot;<br />
<br />
We'd not been in the cell long before the guard returned this time with others carrying trays of food for each <br />
of us... except Morgana. It looked to be luxurious food from the wedding banquet along with a number of <br />
bottles of wine and glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least they are treating us well,&quot; I said as I was handed a tray of food. I noticed the note on the tray <br />
and the strange object with it. The note read &quot;You can be freed once you learn to behave. Here is a little <br />
something to pass the time. From King Connor of the West and Molossian Kingdoms.&quot;<br />
<br />
That signature made me seethe with anger until I realized what the object the note mentioned was. A top my <br />
tray was the black dildo that a guard had been transformed into. The guards gave me a knowing smirk as they <br />
left closing the door behind them.<br />
<br />
As we ate and drank I began pouring a glass or two of wine into the toilet. the wine was quickly going to my <br />
head and it was harder to believe the toilet was actually a person. Maedel protested that I was wasting it but <br />
we seemed to have more than enough for 3 and it wasn't long before we realized why. After, only a glass we all <br />
felt an unimaginable urge to pee. I held off as long as I could but it was useless. I was bursting and if I <br />
didn't hurry I'd soak my dress entirely. I unceremoniously leapt up, pulling my knickers to my ankles. <br />
Morgana's eyes widened comically causing us all to laugh. The laughter made it worse and I can feel a little <br />
squirt come out as I giggled. I had no time left. I turned lifting my skirt giving Morgana a full view of my <br />
royal bottom and Maedel and Arn a view of my shaven front. I was incredibly embarrassed but this was better <br />
tan peeing myself like a child. I sat on Morgana's toilet seat lips and felt and heard a warm kiss. Before I'd <br />
even got comfortable my bladder had relaxed and I was letting a fountain of gold into Morgana's mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be thankful, Morgana,&quot; Maedel drunkenly laughed, &quot;Normally, royalty keep all their gold to <br />
themselves!&quot;<br />
<br />
The stream went on for minutes and I hid my face in my hands as Maedel continued to joke about how Morgana <br />
must be rich by now. The sound of splashing pee and water almost as loud as her and Arn's laughter but soon <br />
Arn was bouncing from one foot to the other, squeezing her thighs together as she could no longer contain <br />
herself. &quot;Please hurry!&quot; she urged me and I snapped back that I was going as fast as I can. It wasn't fast <br />
enough though. Little Arn had drunk too much too quick, not realizing her bladder was much smaller now he was <br />
a she and she literally could not contain herself. A wet spot appeared on her rangers shorts, quickly <br />
expanding and then dripping. She squatted down, covering her tearful face like a child. &quot;Aww don't be such a <br />
wet blanket!&quot; Maedel joked eliciting a guilty smile from Arn. I finished and apologized for taking so long and <br />
was pushed aside by Maedel. <br />
<br />
It was Maedels turn now. She'd continued eating and drinking as we relieved ourselves and Maedel like usual <br />
ate a lot. &quot;I bet you have to drop a log,&quot; Arn sniffled as she removed her sopping shorts and panties, <br />
preferring nudity over sitting in her own mess.<br />
&quot;Haha more wood jokes,&quot; said Maedel whose time as a ranger had clearly gotten her used to or at least less <br />
embarrassed about her bodily functions. It was dangerous to go alone in the forests even for a moment, <br />
afterall.<br />
<br />
In fact, whether due to her nature or from the alcohol, she didn't seem embarrassed in the slightest. &quot;Open <br />
wide, Morgana, time for the main course,&quot; she said taunting the witch who had turned her into wood in the <br />
first place before a series of loud plops followed by the release of her own bladder.<br />
<br />
We still had plenty of food and wine to get through and it wouldn't be long before we'd have to use Morgana <br />
again. I dreaded having to poop into Morgana's mouth but I drunkenly did it all the same. It was clear the <br />
King had sent us this food for the express purpose of humiliating Morgana. I suspected an older grudge between <br />
the two that neither had told us about.</p>
