<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stood in the shadows just a few feet from the back of the shorter man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gelded, why would he be gelded by the Boss if he was showing concern for a person?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
The men turned and glared at me!  The taller man made an advancing step toward me as if to maybe take a swing and knock me down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess if this conversation was brought up to Mister Marquette, he might have a different attitude to the two of you! Now just so I can't complain, tell me what's going on here? Why at dinner is everyone so scared of the Boss, indeed they act as if he were the demon master himself!&quot; I asked trying to show a stern face.<br />
<br />
The men looked at each other and the smaller man gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your closer than you think when you say the Boss is a Demon!&quot; said they little man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet fool,&quot; said the other man.<br />
<br />
&quot;No he is here now and has the right to know what is going on, lest he ends up as so many of our friends have and maybe in time us too!&quot; replied the short man.<br />
<br />
A knod from the one man and they walked each to my side. We walked to the far end of the barn to be sure we were not seen. It was then I had an idea that a question about Jay Barstow and his wife was in order.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a friend up here, his name is Jay Barstow!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
The taller man looked at me and then put his hand on my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wish to see your friend, maybe ask him to tell you about this place? I'm sure he is a good one to confirm anything we tell you! Come he is over this way.&quot; as he waves me to follow him out a side door of the barn and to another building.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Sam no, tell him know, don't scare him!&quot; said the shorter man.<br />
<br />
The taller man walked on an I followed. Once out the door he stood in a transport shute which was used for loading animals into a livestock truck. The man lead the way down the isleway to a corral filled with horses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jay, Jay Barstow this man has some questions!&quot; he said to the darkness as the horses stopped milling about.<br />
<br />
I looked on as they herd of animals parted to see a large Black shape plod toward the fence. The dim light from a security lamp on the peak of the barn gave a orange glow to anything of light colour.<br />
<br />
The big horse strolled close to the fence and as I stepped into the light it began to violently shake it's great head. Snorting and pawing the ground it was easy to see that my presence was upsetting him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we can talk!&quot; said the taller man I now knew to be Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk? Jay Barstow? what's going on here, this makes no sense!&quot; I asked looking from Sam to the horse and back to Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;People like yourself and even me and Jay there come seeking employment and security. The Master up there decide's who from his employees would best serve his needs by being one on one with his livestock.&quot; said Sam looking at the horse.<br />
<br />
The big black horse pawed the ground nervously and began to flick it's tail as though it knew the story well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam are you trying to suggest that Mister Marquette has formulated a way of changing people into animals for his personal good, and maybe profit?&quot; I asked astonished.<br />
<br />
Looking and then stroking the big horses mane Sam said, &quot;Do you want me to tell him Jay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The horse stepped around to turn in a circle, then it drew it's great head over the fence and very close to my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haieee Haahum!&quot; came from the mouth an lips of the horse.<br />
<br />
I stood looking and then began to laugh, &quot;Boy you had me going there with this bull story of Master's and their victims, now lets really talk about what you two were going on about!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet stupid, it's all true aske the horse to paw his answer as yes and no!&quot; said Sam with disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Horsey are you Jay Barstow and if so kick your hind right leg two times to signal a yes?&quot; I asked feeling even more the fool.<br />
<br />
The big horse looked at me close and with a snort kicked his hind right leg a full kick two times. Then turning to me again it made a noise, &quot;Haie Haahoo, Haahumm!&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt even more a fool and was still not accepting this horse's story. I walked along the fence a few feet and the big animal followed me along. Sam was looking about as though we might soon have company.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's been too long we will be missed,&quot; said Sam sounding very worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on back and I'll follow in a few minute then nobody should question our meeting,&quot; I suggested.<br />
<br />
Sam quickly walked back to the barn. Then I turned to the big horse. &quot;Now without his prompting are you Jay Barstow?&quot; I asked feeling foolish talking to the animal as if he understood. &quot;Then give a pawing with your right hoof once and two kicks with your left hind leg to agree!&quot;<br />
<br />
I knew full well the horse could never figure this out and turned to walk back to the barn.<br />
<br />
A snort and his front right hoof pawed the ground once as he gave two easy kicks with his left hind leg. I was open mouth  astonished!<br />
<br />
I looked now at the total horse standing near me. A tall fifteen hand high he stood looking a solid formed draft horse. I bent down to check if male as the horse reached over the fence and gave my butt a nudge.<br />
<br />
Falling to my knee the sight of a hugh dark sheath and a partial soft horse cock wiggled in the light. Why I don't know to this day but my hand reached to touch what for all my life I longed to touch. <br />
<br />
The soft warm member felt of great sexual power. As my hand cupped the urethia end of the still limp cock the stallion stretched his stance and began to have sensual feelings.  The member began to move from it's dark home and move out into the light.  Longer and more massive it strained as it grew out a good two feet long.<br />
<br />
The head flared into a flanged flat end looking as though this horse had been born a horse and never was a man.  I felt small feeler hairs along it's massive body. The tickle of my touch made him snort and he began to swing the cock.<br />
<br />
He would pull the member up till it bounced into his round belly. Then he would relax and it swung down with such force till it his one of his hind legs. This action continued for several minutes as I touched and the crawled between the fence to kneel by this gorgous sexy member.<br />
<br />
I looked up into his dark groin to see two hugh grapefruit sized testicles begin to churn in their soft leathery sack. Somehow I knew he was about to release a load. To this day I don't know why and hom but in an instant I was totally beneath his belly and had his cock in my hands.<br />
<br />
The view of his urethia was in my sight as I opened my mouth and fingered the flared head passed my strained wide lips. My tongue pursed the scaly end of this beastly member as my mind wondered what I was doing?<br />
<br />
The left hand was stroking the long shaft as it felt a load moving ever so swiftly dow the shaft. It his like an explosion on heat and salty taste. I closed my eyes as I choked to clods of semen down. It came and came again as my stomac filled with the strong smelling load.<br />
<br />
At last he softened and I sat down below him.</p>
