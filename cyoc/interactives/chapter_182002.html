<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina and Sofia were now riding across the sands in their all terrain vehicle, Viki and Lucy followed behind in another, the train was currently hidden in the clouds, Alice on standby to retrieve them if necessary &quot;there it is, the vehicle wreckage&quot; said Sofia saddly as she turned the vehicle towards the shine of metal in the desert sun.<br />
<br />
As they pulled up along side the wrecked they could see the full extent of the damage, large claw marks covered the roll cage, in some spots cutting clean through it, sand and rock filled the cabin and engine block, and two of the wheels were ripped off, the axle left sparking, with green fluid dripping into the scorching desert ground.<br />
<br />
Lina, Sofia, Viki and Lucy all got out of their vehicles to investigate the area, Lina waddled over to the wreckage and placed her hand on the roll cage, a tear escaping her as guilt once again began to build within her &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Violet, Catherine.....I swear I will make things right, Sofia is looking after your baby girl, I just hope you can find peace&quot; she said as she felt a hand on the side of her belly, looking to her right she saw Viki had her arm wrapped around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one blames you ya know, they knew the risk when they came out here&quot; said Viki, Lina wiped her tears &quot;they may not blame me but I blame myself, if I hadn&#39;t asked them to come out here, they would still be alive and you know it&quot; said Lina angrily.<br />
<br />
Then the ground began to tremble, as clouds of sand began to rise from the desert, and formed a dust storm around them, Lina pulled the silk of her sleeve over her mouth and eyes to try and keep the sand out, then lina herd a scream behind her, turning she saw that Sofia had disappeared, then another scream, and Lucy was gone too, finally Viki and Lina felt something rough and long wrap around there legs before pulling them below the sand.<br />
<br />
When Lina awoke it was in some sort of cave, beams of light shining down through a crystal roof, giant stone pillars engraved with lizards running the length of a giant bridge that lay in the center of the cave, the ravine in the center of the cave was wide, its depths an inky abyss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh my head&quot; groaned Lina as she tried to get up, looking around she saw her wives and Sofia lay strew about the room, Viki lay under a beam if light, Sofia was proped up against a bolder and Lucy was proped up against one of the pillars of the bridge, then Lina&#39;s hands flew to her belly, worry filling her mind, had she landed on her belly?, were her babies OK?, were they hurt?.<br />
<br />
All of linas worries were washed away when she felt three strong kickes against her wombs walls, Lina hugged her belly &quot;thank goodness your alright, mama didn&#39;t know what she would have done if any of you got hurt, then Linas eyes drifted across the bridge, there was a doorway carved into the cave wall, in the shape of a large frill neck lizard, its eyes made of some type of yellow jewels, and inside was a stone pedestal, with a beam of light glaring down on what they had come here for,<br />
<br />
&quot;The medallion!&quot; Shouted Lina, causing everyone to begin to stur, Sofia was the first one up, having a simular reaction to Lina&#39;s, her breath ceasing and her hands flew to her belly, before sighing with relief  as she dusted the sand off herself, next to awaken was Lucy, a cut on her neck was dripping blood, but other than that she was fine, her baby could be seen through her transparent womb, rolling around, trying to get her bearings.<br />
<br />
Then Lina and Lucy froze as they saw Viki, Viki herself was unharmed, apart from a slight bruise above her right eye, but as she awakened and looked down she let out a scream, Chloey hadn&#39;t made it, the fall into the cave had hurt her badly, her body could be seen through Vikis womb turning into green mist and disappearing, Vikis belly returning flat as Viki held her now empty belly and sobbed, everyone remained frozen to the spot, a cloud of sadness now hung over the group, Echo and Mary stopped moving in Lucy and Lina as they felt their siblings passing.<br />
<br />
Soon Vikis tears ran dry, but she continued to sob, Lina and Lucy holding her tight, then the group herd it, a low growl, looking a cross the bridge no one could believe what they saw.<br />
<br />
A giant lizard stood in the doorway, its body seemed to be composed of a moving sandstorm, with bits of stone forming spines along its body, then it melted into a cloud of dust as it shot upwards, then reappearing clinging to two of the pillars on the left side, watching them, waiting for the group to give it an excuse to strike, its long whip like tail then shot up through the crystal roof, and pulled down the wreckage of Violet and Catherine&#39;s vehicle, tossing it into the cravas below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister, what has become of you&quot; said Storm in Linas mind &quot;she&#39;s gone ferral, being trapped down here for so long, it&#39;s begun to drive her mad&quot; said Echo sadly, Lina had seen enough people get hurt to last her a lifetime, first Momo, then Violet and Catherine, and now Chloey, leaving Viki sad and broken, Lina had had enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were going to help her, together&quot; said Lina as she heaved herself and Viki to stand, Lucy helping while Viki continued to stair at the ground, her hands folded over her belly still, then Lina glared at the lizard, as it leaped off its pillars and landed on the bridge, now standing directly infront of them then Lina spoke, her &quot;mommy voice&quot; coming back with new ferocity, she wasn&#39;t just mad, now she was furious &quot;I know you can hear me, and you can understand me full well young lady!, you have hurt my friends, even struck down one of your own sisters, now you have five seconds to change back and apologise or I will let Viki here avenge her baby&quot; said Lina as she mentally spoke to Echo &quot;I can feel your rage sweetheart, but you must at least try to forgive her, she&#39;s not in full control, I&#39;m trying to get her to see reason, but if she won&#39;t turn to her human form........I will need you and your sisters help to FORCE her to see sence&quot; thought Lina, the last thing she wanted was to see her daughters fight, even worse if they got hurt, but they had no other choice.<br />
<br />
The Lizard razed its head and let out a earth shaking roar, a giant frill extended from its neck and began to glow, then Lina saw Viki walking towards the Lizard &quot;I hate you, I hate that you killed my friends, I hate that you killed my baby, and I hate that your attempting to kill us, but I also feel sorry for you, I can feel your anger, your fear, your sorrow, and we want to help&quot; said Viki as she extended her hand out to the sand Lizard muzzle, &quot;I want to help you&quot; said Vikias she then hugged the lizards nose.<br />
<br />
Then the sand that made up the lizard began to blow away, falling to the ground in a pile of sand, leaving behind a young girl on her knees, bawling her eyes out, her hair a chocolate brown in a plate so long it must have reached her feet, her skin was a ritch brown, with freckles over her nose and cheeks, her eyes were a ritch green, her arms however were most bizarre, where there should have been skin was brown scales and spines ending at her wrists.<br />
<br />
She wore a simple brown cloth shirt and skirt that reached her knees and wore no shoes, she was covered in sand and mud, but she didn&#39;t bother moving as she cried, Viki then began climbing the sand, heading straight for the little girl, Lina whent to stop her, but Sofia put her hand on her sholder to stop her, Lina turned to argue, but Sofia simply shook her head, then Lina turned her attention back to Viki, she now stood above the girl, the girl then looked up at Viki with tears in her eyes, before she put her head on the ground and sobbed &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!, so sorry I&#39;m a bad girl I know that, and I&#39;m sorry!&quot; She cried, her tears falling into the sand, then Viki draped her arms around the girl, and pulled her in close against her breasts, the girls cries now slightly muffled as Viki stroked her hair.<br />
<br />
As soon as the girls cries stopped, Viki pulled her away from her to look at her &quot;Are you ready to join your sisters?&quot; Said Viki as she placed a hand on her cheek, then whispered into her ear, the girl then nodded, and hugged Viki before walking towards Lina, her head down in shame<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told you have my sisters in you, if you think I deserve it mommy, can you name me, so I may join them?&quot; She said, her voice sounding like windchill, soft yet musicle, Lina then cupped the girls cheeks and pulled her in close as she looked up at Viki, Lucy waddling over and embracing her lovingly, before turning to the girl, who now had her arms wrapped tightly around Linas swell, her he&#39;d ear pressed against its rubber surface &quot;ok then my daughter, your name will be Ava, now come, be with your sisters, I think they have missed you&quot; said Lina, a burning sensation returning over her left arm, as she watched a frill neck lizard apear under the peacocks wing, its eyes glowing yellow, then another appeared, it was a purple mask, its features resembling that from Indian culture, it appeared under the peacocks foot, bringing her total up to four.<br />
<br />
Then Lina&#39;s vision began to blur as she felt her birth canal being filled with mist, then she fell out cold..........</p>
