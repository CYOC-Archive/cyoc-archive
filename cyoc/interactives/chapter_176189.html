<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another day, another boring calculus class. Unfortunately for Danny, he didn&#39;t manage to meet up with Gabe and Terry before class started. However, he did hear people talking about them. People were saying that they were looking different, especially Terry, who people thought was looking more handsome, but in a more metrosexual way, whatever that meant. People were also saying that they looked a bit sick, maybe because they were thinner, or their skin tone started to change? He had to see this for himself to make sure.<br />
<br />
Hearing those rumors got Danny excited to observe the changes, and luckily for him, he had weight room with both of them. Danny had no clue why the football team and the basketball team shared the same weight room time, but he was glad that they did now.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, rather than just sleeping through calc, Danny decided to be a little productive with the Chronivac. After pulling it out, Danny decided to first see if Sasha infected anyone else, and she did. It seems like she had infected Sam from the soccer team. Just one, huh? Guess she also had some school work to catch up on and couldn&#39;t do some of her &quot;Extracurricular activities.&quot; Honestly, Danny didn&#39;t know too much about Sam and only seen him and talking to him on occasion, so he really didn&#39;t care much to observe him like Gabe and Terry. Still, he&#39;ll try to keep tabs on him, at least with the Chronivac. He also needs to replace him later with a nerd too.<br />
<br />
Oh, speaking of, he needed to collect some data on the Asian nerds to replace the jocks. Good thing he was in the high school calc class, so there was no shortage of them. Oh, how he hated the fact that his Highschool was so stereotypical, but at least it was useful to him now. Danny told the Chronivac to scan all the Asian males in the classroom to transform them later. Oh, the machine picked up the information on his calc teacher, Mr. Ito, too... Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Nah. As much as Danny was tempted to change his teacher, he decided against it. He already had too many transformations to keep track of; he really didn&#39;t need one more. Perhaps later, when Sasha got most of the white jocks.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as he was about to decide which nerd he should replace Gabe&#39;s spot on the football team with, he was suddenly interrupted by Mr. Ito. &quot;Alright, class, put everything away except for a pencil and your calculator. It&#39;s time for your quiz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darn, looks like now wasn&#39;t the time to make any changes, Danny thought. Guess he would have to wait until he got home to make some changes. Oh well, perhaps this was for the best, considering he got unusually turned on when transforming someone, and he didn&#39;t want to pop a boner during class.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
A few hours later, and it was time for the team to head to the weight room. There Danny saw Gabe and Terry for the first time since yesterday, and they did look like they changed. He couldn&#39;t tell for sure since he was observing them from a distance, but they definitely looked a bit thinner. If their transformation was more than 1/7th of a way complete, that would mean that they lost 1/7th of their muscle mass, right?<br />
<br />
Anyway, still wanting to get a workout in, Danny continued to observe the two from a distance. His two jock targets look like they were having problems with the weights today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what is with us today?&quot; Gabe asked as he was spotting Terry on the Bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... think we partied... too hard last night?&quot; Terry panted after struggling and failing to lift the usual amount of weight. Looks like they were in denial over the fact they were getting weaker. Danny couldn&#39;t help but crack a smile at this... and get a bit turned on. He was about to chastize himself internally about this, but then he heard another voice enter the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, you wimps are tired? Here, let me show you how it&#39;s done!&quot; The voice had belonged to Jackson. Oh right, with all his observing of Terry and Gabe, Danny had almost forgotten he was turning Jackson into a muscle daddy. Anyway, Jackson loaded up the rack with more weight than Danny had ever seen him lift before and then did reps with ease. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah! You see that! You two could learn a thing or two from an Alpha male! In fact, you betas should worship me!&quot; Jackson cried out after he did his final rep. He was flexing and feeling good pretty good about himself; too bad that feeling will change in 11 days. Actually, that feeling was going to change now as a meek voice suddenly disrupted everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Daddy...&quot; Danny blinked. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was Gabe or Terry who said that. That one small sentence caused the entire weight room to go silent. Everything just stopped for the moment, and then everyone just awkwardly returned to what they were doing. It was liked everyone just mutually decided to pretend that didn&#39;t happen. Danny had to use so much willpower not to burst out laughing, he almost dropped the weight he was carrying. Whoops, that could have been bad.<br />
<br />
Jackson tried to stay far away from Gabe and Terry for the rest of the period, and Gabe and Terry tried to do the same. Once the period ended, both Gabe and Terry looked defeated and humiliated. As Danny was relishing in the sadistic pleasure of watching them looked like that, he suddenly came up with a way to continue to observe those two up close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you guys, you look like you were really struggling today. You know there&#39;s a gym right down the street from my house. Why don&#39;t we meet up after school, and I can show you guys how to properly lift.&quot; Gabe and Terry&#39;s eyes seemed to light up as Danny said that. After watching him work out yesterday, they knew that Danny had more experience working out and wanted to learn from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? That would be awesome, wouldn&#39;t it, Gabe?&quot; Terry excitedly responded, making him look more boyish than usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! It does, bro, but let&#39;s do it tomorrow. I&#39;m so tired after today, I want to make sure I&#39;m not getting sick.&quot; <br />
<br />
Oh, you sure were sick, Danny thought to himself. Infected with an STD courtesy of Sasha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sound great. I&#39;ll meet you there tomorrow.&quot;  Danny then said goodbye to the two, smirking to himself once their backs were turned.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once Danny had gotten back home, he heard his brother yelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what? What the hell?!&quot; Danny had found Jin carrying a big bag of soil looking quite confused. Oh, that&#39;s right. Danny&#39;s father had told him that he ordered a bag of special soil for the garden and told them to bring it in once it got there. Usually, Jin struggled with carrying those heavy bags, but now his brother held the bag with relative ease. That explains why he yelled and was looking confused.<br />
<br />
Well, it was time to fake another reaction to not raise suspicion. It kinda scary how good he was getting at lying, Danny mused. &quot;Whoa, bro, did you finally take my advice and started working out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No,&quot; Jin replied, looking a bit flustered. &quot;Maybe I just remembered these bags being heavier before.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jin turned around to but the bag away, Danny noticed that the shirt Jin was wearing this morning fitting a bit tighter around the shoulders and back than before. It won&#39;t be long now before his bro reaches his level.<br />
<br />
After that, Danny went to his room and pulled out the Chronovic once again. Before he messed with any more people, he realized that there were so many transformations to keep track of now. Perhaps he should make a list to keep track of it all.<br />
<br />
Pulling out his notebook Danny wrote down a table of all the transformations that were happening right now.<br />
<br />
Jock to Twink<br />
------------------------------<br />
Gabe - Main Target of observation - Linebacker - 2/7 days in<br />
Terry - Main Target of observation - Basket Ball player - 2/7 days in<br />
Sam - Keeping tabs - Soccer player - 1/7 days in.<br />
<br />
Asian and Nerdy to Asian Jock<br />
------------------------------<br />
None a the moment.<br />
<br />
Others<br />
------------------------------<br />
Jackson - Muscle Daddy - 3/14 days in<br />
Jin - Something like me - 1/7 days in<br />
<br />
It probably would be best to move this list to a computer to add to the lists easier. For now, though, it was probably time to add to that second list.</p>
