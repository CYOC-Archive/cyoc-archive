<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">whatever those bastards had injected into my girlfriend&#39;s body back then had changed her into something out of myth or legends. what I didn&#39;t know from out of the numerous possibilities my beloved Molly would have transformed into that I completely didn&#39;t expect something which lived in water. My inner childhood would be screaming at the top of my lungs out of pure joy to see something straight out of my fantasy, That is, if it wasn&#39;t for my girlfriend as she was now.<br />
<br />
In appearance, Molly now looked like a combination of horse, a lionfish, and a pink river dolphin for the effect. However though, Molly&#39;s eyes, hair, and almost her hands were still human that When Molly first saw herself in her fully transformed body, well... let&#39;s just say my girlfriend was beyond distraught. I could still recount her reaction in expression as her dark drown webbed clawed hands were shaking in fear. Her screams were a mixed between hers and that of a horses neighs. she soon struggled out of her chair as her legs were no more that they were nothing more then a merged fish tail.<br />
<br />
collapsing onto her knees, or if she had them that she was then crying in utter despair and misery over at what happened to her. she kept questioning how could she ever be able to live a normal life, along with becoming truly scared of being sold, dissected by the government, end up in a zoo, or worse thatshe and I both knew what has now become of her as she was now a Mythological known as a hippocampus. <br />
<br />
anyways, time passed as it was a long time ago. fasting forward back six months to the present that ever since Molly&#39;s transformation, her life was never the same. her life style wasn&#39;t the same as she had to live in the ocean that we both moved to my beach house, to where we both spend our summer fun together as it was now my home. my mind kept thinking back toward the good old days, back when my girlfriend used to be...well, human. yet, after all that has happened, she still has her loving personality, especially we still love each other, but... It&#39;s very hard to have a conversation with your girlfriend when she swims off on you during the entire day.<br />
<br />
one night when I woke up to find Molly on the house docks crying that I came out to comfort her as she went to visit her parents, but only for them to become scared of her at first as they soon came to realize the truth when she revealed herself to them. it took them some time for their daughter to be a monster that they secretly kept her ID from the others, even if they had to say harsh things when with other people. regardless, they&#39;d begun to visit regularly as she felt comfortable taking online classes, rather then going to classes with all the stairs she&#39;d gotten instead.<br />
<br />
her cushion of her side of the family tree had a doctor, though she still felt really uncomfortable about being check up by him as he one year put a frog down her back of her shirt. she would be asked to wear a bridle halter when being examined. she eventually started to get the use of having the halter bridle on that she secretly ask for it to be on her, but not in public use as she will sometimes give me a ride on her back. he too would have her get an x-ray, as well as having us pay my family a visit that we realize they were already completely aware of Molly&#39;s condition, which pretty much blew their minds when they saw a real living hippocampus before them. After all, the x-ray pictures showed multiple things, including a fully functional fish tail, along with her set of webbed hands, even her equine like head.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t know WHAT to say. Molly never once begged, order, threatened, or anything, as she simply TRUSTED ME not to tell anyone. For the her sake on the line, I couldn&#39;t say anything. The least I could do was return that trust. She was humming a tune to herself with every beautiful and graceful motion that I was betting it hadn&#39;t been heard before.<br />
<br />
one day as she was getting checked, Molly made the conversation. &quot;Honey, I just wanted you to know that I don&#39;t blame you as it was a little childish of me of ever to do so. I won&#39;t forgive those vermin bastards for violating my body, but I now understand that this was not a curse, but a gift. I was simply too limited before to appreciate it. Those filth likely didn&#39;t have a clue at what they were doing. Maybe they were hoping for a human minded monster would be easier to control than a full blooded one. i&#39;m starting to think now that maybe those others tests were just to see if it was possible while working with the DNA of mundane beasts, before moving on to their nest step of majesty creatures which held true power. This is all just a speculation on my part dear of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I said cautiously while gently rubbing her equine head.</p>
