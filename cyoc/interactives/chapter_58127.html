<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cara thought for a moment at the question.  Her blank expression plus twitching nose and ears meant she was obviously having the same difficultly concentrating on a single thought as Emily was earlier.  What did she want to do anyway...There was something she said earlier before eating right...?  Eating... Mmmm... that steak was SO good...  Wait, and seriously what was up with her retro 80's bush today and her sudden need to feel pleasure...?  And is that someone's cell phone ringing...? What's that odd tugging sensation in her ears?  Is it the light or are her arms looking a bit hairier too today... nah, must be the light.  And what the heck is that smell, is that...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey earth to Cara,&quot; Emily gently prodded with a smile snapping two long nailed fingers playfully.  After all, she knew exactly what the girl was going through.  Her understanding of it all enabling her to channel and focus her senses a bit a better than her friend and in fact she was already getting the hang of it.  Seems like all of that werewolf research, pure wishful folly she thought at the time, was finally coming in handy.  Plus, she was always a straight-A student, and a quick study.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wait, yeah I remember now!&quot;  Cara exclaimed with the triumphant expression of someone who just found their lost car keys.  &quot;You know, before you got back from shopping today I just felt so blah.  But now, I just really feel like being active and out.  Let's go to the new club Leigh and Veronica told us about.  Apparently it's pretty wicked cool and it's ladies night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I don't know about that...&quot; Emily stalled.  Shouldn't they just stay in and play it safe considering the circumstances?  Oh wait.  &quot;...but on second thought,&quot; she continued, &quot;that actually sounds like a good idea.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It just occurred to Emily that a darkened, noisy, busy club might just be the perfect place to prevent her roommate from noticing any further changes on Emily or herself.  Or from doing any more self-inspections.  The fact that Cara had not yet caught on to her condition further bolstered Emily's confidence in her plan.  Even if Cara was just in denial, it was all the same to Emily.  Things were oddly going, dare she say, swimmingly her way so far.  She smiled to herself, feeling the pin-prick of baby fangs once again on her lower lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome Possum! I'm going to start getting ready,&quot; Cara said and retreated excitedly to her room to begin getting dressed.<br />
<br />
Emily then went to her own room and changed into one of her usual, slightly goth, slightly safe, slightly sexy-as-she-dared outfits.  She immediately noticed how well her old stand-by shirt now hugged her larger, firmer breasts.  She'd never looked this good and, honestly, she too felt like going out and showing off a bit.  A totally new feeling for her.  She brimmed with confidence as she looked in the mirror approvingly at her now more sensual visage.  The new angles in her face giving just the right mix of danger and beauty.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Cara was having much the same experience.  She, however, had never had a problem with confidence.  Always on the receiving end of double takes from men and even some women.  Maybe opposites attracted and this is why her and Emily had becomes such fast friends: they met in the middle.  Some of her outgoing nature rubbing off on Emily, and Emily's practicality bringing the sometimes flighty Cara back down to earth.  <br />
<br />
Cara re-emerged from her room in almost no time flat.  An amazing feat for someone known to preen for an hour. She was of course wearing none other than one of her infamous favorite skirts.  And with it a midriff-baring, low-cut top that would have given her father a disapproval coronary.  Especially considering how much more cleavage she was revealing now that she filled it out so much better.  Emily once again felt a blush return to her cheeks as she took in the sight and tried not to stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think?  I feel like I'm totally rocking this outfit tonight.&quot; Cara began striking a pose for her friend's benefit and approval.  &quot;And whoa, you are looking amazing yourself tonight, Em.  Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey thanks. And yeah you look like a freakin' Victoria's Secret model or something.  Geez.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Emily was actually surprised at her words as she usually tried to get her friend to tone it down a bit. But now, hey she had to admit Cara looked even more amazing than usual.  Why not flaunt if you got it?  Plus she was happy to note for Cara's sake that her friend's legs were still staying smooth in that skirt.  How long would that last though?  Her books really weren't clear on the topic of post-shaving hair regrowth in new-found lycanthropes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Race you to the car!&quot; Cara suddenly blurted out, causing Emily's ears to twinge at the sudden loud noise.  She let out a yelp as Emily gave her a playful shove that was probably a bit more forceful than she intended.<br />
<br />
As they both mock-sprinted to the door, with Cara leading the way, Emily's gaze did fall upon her friend's fuzzy lower back exposed by her unfortunate choice of shirt.  If anything the hair seemed to have thickened since she had last seen in the market, but Emily didn't have the heart to tell her to switch tops.  She noticed too that Cara's forearms seemed a bit hairier than usual, and it even crept up her upper arm a bit to exhibit a light dusting of tiny hairs on her shoulders. A light dusting that almost connected with the line of light dark hair that crept down the nape of her neck until it disappeared underneath her top.  It was not really too outside the norm for a girl of partial Mediterranean descent, though, Emily reassured herself.  Actually she admitted to herself that she found it somehow alluring.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, as they neared Leigh and Victoria's door, Cara out of nowhere abruptly stopped causing Emily to bump into her friend who let out a noise that almost sounded like a whine.  She barely noticed either the impact or the involuntary sound, though, as she was fixated on something and once again trying to focus.  Her nose twitched twice, taking in a scent she had picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey do you think we should see if these two want to come with?  Or just keep it you and me?&quot;</p>
