<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was still taking Jeff a few minutes to fully understand what was going on. Even more so that his brain seemed to have slowed down along with the physical changes. He could remember just about everything from his previous life, yet that felt more like dream rather than reality. Staying up late watching anime and reading were still there, but memories of being on the football team and getting a scholarship for it were far stronger. Though, wanting to fuck big athletic men still stayed the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;What else has changed?&quot; he wondered as he pulled up his computer, looking through old photos. Grandma and grandpa were still the same. Same with mom. But then why did he change? He let out a bit of a smug grunt thinking that he really is his father&#39;s son. &quot;The fuck is wrong with me?&quot; the arrogance and pride he felt in himself and his father seemed to be on another level. <br />
<br />
Jeff continued through the pictures online, definitely noticing that there were far more of them than he&#39;d ever taken before. Stranger still were how many girls were in them as well. He let out a bit of a snarl thinking about how he preferred their boyfriends, but quickly bat it down with, &#39;any port in a storm,&#39; logic. And based off his memories, there were a lot of &#39;storms.&#39;<br />
<br />
A ring of the doorbell brought Jeff out of his memories. He nearly jumped at the thought. &quot;Oh shit...&quot; was reality actually changed? Would people freak out seeing a 6&#39;8&quot; 300+ pound muscular tiger man? But based off the pictures, they should have. He took a breath and looked out the window to see Dave&#39;s car outside. &quot;Dad!&quot; Jeff called through the house.<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t answer so Jeff went to his bedroom. &quot;Dad?&quot; Jeff repeated opening the door. There his father was splayed out with his cock in hand and a hefty bit of cum coating his furry abs. His eyes locked on the massive cock; another reason he knew he was his father&#39;s son. Yet, not a single ounce of discomfort hit him as he watched his dad bask in the afterglow. &quot;Dad?&quot; Jeff repeated. &quot;Dave&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Dave?&quot; Mike stammered. He sat up. Noticing his son, he instantly covered up with a pillow. &quot;What&#39;s he doing here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably to watch football?&quot; Jeff rolled his eyes. &quot;Like normal? I think he brought Finn too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Fuck,&quot; Mike cursed. &quot;I completely forgot it&#39;s Sunday... Alright. Uhhh... Just give me a minute and I&#39;ll get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Jeff said. As he was about to leave, he turned back. &quot;Hey. You notice anything different about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stared blankly for a few seconds. He was really trying to take it in. &quot;New shirt?&quot; he finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Yeah. New shirt,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Looks nice. Don&#39;t it?&quot; The dark blue sleeveless shirt pressed hard against his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bud. Looks real nice,&quot; Mike smiled. &quot;Oh... And thanks for turning me into a tiger. Probably shouldn&#39;t say this, but I was getting kind of jealous of you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jealous of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike laughed. &quot;No need to be modest bud. It doesn&#39;t suit you.&quot; The doorbell rang again. &quot;Go ahead and get that. I can&#39;t wait to show Dave the new me. He&#39;s going to be so jealous...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and headed to the front door. He opened it up and Dave gave him a very excited, &quot;Hey! Almost thought you guys weren&#39;t home.&quot; His son Finn was standing right behind him looking at his phone. Jeff still had plenty of old memories of Finn from his Dad and Dave doing this football Sunday thing and most of them weren&#39;t good. The jock really made sure to let Jeff know that he was gay and not okay with it. Even with their dads talking to Finn about it, the guy wouldn&#39;t let up. Especially at school. Though, all of that was different now. And the girlfriend he was texting right now sure wasn&#39;t as loyal as she might have been. As Jeff knew that from very personal experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad&#39;s taking a shower and I didn&#39;t realize it,&quot; Jeff said. He ushered the two in adding a &#39;sup?&#39; to Finn. Who gave him a head tilt as he passed. A grin appeared on Jeff&#39;s face as he was now looking down at the stud instead of up. At 6&#39;2&quot; it always felt like he was absolutely massive, now there was a whole head difference between the two and he was the taller one. Though that height must have come from his mother&#39;s side as Dave was pretty average in height and build. Though, the gut he was growing clearly wasn&#39;t something he liked.<br />
<br />
Dave made himself at home as he went to the fridge and grabbed a beer for himself. &quot;You want anything big guy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a water,&quot; Jeff answered before he even realized Dave was talking to him. It wasn&#39;t normal for Jeff to hang around. He was usually in his room while &#39;game day&#39; was on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Dave tossed it to him and he instinctively caught it. &quot;Don&#39;t look so surprised. Be kind of crazy if a big football stud like you couldn&#39;t catch that.&quot; Dave said, patting Jeff&#39;s broad shoulders. Then tossed a beer to his son and sat on the couch. He spread himself out wide on the sofa, really making it feel like his home. It was the same with his son, who comfortably rested his feet on the coffee table. &quot;You gonna join us? Or just loom over the couch?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Jeff another second to realize that was an invite. &quot;Uhh... I might. I got some homework I have to finish first, but yeah. Should be able to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Mr. Studious over here,&quot; Dave laughed. Then slapped his son&#39;s foot. &quot;Maybe you should take a lesson or two from him Finn. Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn rolled his eyes. He clearly wasn&#39;t having it. And college was a bit harder for him than he thought it&#39;d be. &quot;Whatever dad...&quot; He clearly wanted to say something else but bit his tongue as he continued texting. <br />
<br />
Mike made his entrance with his football jersey on. With how wide his shoulders were and broad his chest, it basically looked like he was wearing football pads underneath it. &quot;&#39;Ey boys,&quot; he cheered. &quot;Didn&#39;t start the game without me did ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry big guy. Game starts with or without you here. And if you&#39;re going to spend all this time dolling yourself up, it&#39;s on you,&quot; Dave said.<br />
<br />
For a second Mike was taken aback. &quot;You don&#39;t notice anything different?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave paused. &quot;Am I supposed to?&quot; he looked up and down the massive tiger man and then shrugged. &quot;Dunno big guy. Tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike gave him a flex. &quot;Nothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t go flirting in front of the kids now,&quot; Dave joked. &quot;It&#39;ll make them feel uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike stared a bit dumbfounded but then seemed to find his wedding picture on the wall. There stood him as a tiger holding his wife gently. Then everything seemed to click. &quot;Maybe they need to get used ta it?&quot; Mike joked back. It took him a bit before he was able to get to his usual joking stride, but it seemed to come pretty quickly. He plopped down on the couch next to Dave.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to take his leave and go back to his room.</p>
