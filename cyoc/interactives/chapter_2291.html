<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The silvery flash that had filled Brett's vision faded after a moment to reveal a massive, silver pillar, lying on its side only a short distance away.  Shrunk to barely a half foot tall, Brett's perspective was skewed horribly by his circumstances.  Only minutes before, as he'd been playing basketball in the backyard, he'd found himself swifly -inexorably- dwindling in size ... shrinking right out of his clothing!
<br />

<br />
Having heard the distant roar of his father's car pulling up out front, he'd desperately tried to run for the back door, but gotten slowed down in the grass.  Why this was happening was unknown to him but he'd read enough fantasy books and fairy tales to know magic when he saw it.
<br />

<br />
And, now, a giant, silver object, as long as a skycraper beam, had appeared in a flash before him.  It was longer than he was tall and came up to his knees.  He could see his reflection in it as he approached.
<br />

<br />
&quot;This ... this is too weird...&quot; he muttered to himself, nervously.
<br />

<br />
A sudden, booming rumble shook the ground.
<br />

<br />
His tiny mass easily controlled by his proportionately stronger muscles, Brett didn't fall over, but quickly turned around to see where the large, rhythmic booming was coming from.
<br />

<br />
His tiny eyes opened wide and stared.
<br />

<br />
A giant was bearing down on him; a giant that looked just like his neighbor, Matt!  The giant teenager had a look of sheer horror on his face and -quickly- Brett realized that he was bearing down on him with his eyes fixed on the giant, silver wand.
<br />

<br />
Brett blinked.  A wand.  *That's* what it was!  It had to be!
<br />

<br />
With all his strength, the shrunken boy dove for the silvery surface and pressed himself against it.  &quot;Make me big again,&quot; he squeaked, desperately.  Nothing happened.  The booming of Matt's feet grew closer, shaking the giant-sized turf beneath Brett's feet with heavier and heavier thuds.  &quot;Make me big again!  Make me big!&quot; he squeaked, over and over!
<br />

<br />
He looked up, seeing Matt bear down on him!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, god...  I wish I had more time...&quot;
<br />

<br />
The wand flashed and, aimed at Matt as it was, the narrow, faint beam it emanated struck the oncoming teen square in the foot.  Matt winced, and bent over to cover his head, but the approaching booms stopped.
<br />

<br />
Cautiously, after a moment, he opened his eyes and looked up.  Matt's giant foot was poised only a few yards away, filling Brett's vision.  All around the shrunken boy, though, the world continued un-frozen.  It was only the giant Matt who had been stopped, still moving, but in hyper-slow motion...
<br />

<br />
Brett had gotten his wish!  He had more time!
<br />

<br />
But how *much* more...?
<br />

<br />
Quickly, he jogged around to the end of the wand and stood in front of it...  &quot;I wish I was big!&quot; he said, putting his hands on the tip.  The wand flared, again...
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Matt's feet hit the ground only seconds after the second flash.  He blinked and shielded his eyes, but to no avail.  He stared at the space where tiny Brett had been standing.  Both Brett and the wand were gone.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh shit...&quot; he muttered to himself.  Panting, he adjusted the painfully tight bind on his foot-and-a-half soft cock in his trousers.  Running was painful, now...  &quot;Where'd that little shit go...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
He glanced around, nervously and -for a moment- considered calling out his young neighbor's name.  Still, someone might hear him and if it was someone who knew him, it could conjure up all sorts of unwanted questions...
<br />

<br />
Glancing around himself, he decided that discression was the better part of valor and crept back over the property line into his back yard.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Where *is* he...?&quot; he muttered to himself.  &quot;And where is that damn wand...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Suddenly, he remembered.  Smacking his forehead with his palm, Matt chuckled to himself.  It didn't matter where the wand was *now* ... he could always summon it!  And once he had it...
<br />

<br />
He sighed.
<br />

<br />
He'd have to use the wand to wish for Brett back.  Sexual fantasies aside, he didn't want to be the cause of anything bad happening to someone...
<br />

<br />
Sitting down in the sandbox (with another grimace as his grapefruit-sized balls bunched up between his legs), Matt closed his eyes and wished for the wand back.
<br />

<br />
A heavy thud and vibration made him open his eyes.
<br />

<br />
He looked up to see a large, bearded, muscular man looming over him.  He was wearing tattered clothing, very old and too-small for him ... the very image of someone who'd been on a desert island for years...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Who...who...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Matt's eyes focused on the stranger's right hand.  In it, he held the wand, and it was pointed at Brett.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Don't remember me?&quot; the stranger said with a shake of his head.  &quot;I may have spent ten years on that blasted mountain, but I finally got back here...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Matt blinked.  &quot;Brett...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The stranger did look a lot like Brett, but -now- easily Matt's age ... or older.  He was rugged and toned; his tan spoke of years spent out doors in the elements.  Had the wand sent him somewhere?  But that was impossible ... he'd only been missing for moments!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's me...  Now, before I use this thing to wish you down to an inch tall and step on you, you've got five seconds to beg for your life...&quot;</p>
