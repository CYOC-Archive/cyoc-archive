<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moving on, Oliver took notice of his boxers on his bed. It filled him with a question: How much smaller was he now compared to his original self?<br />
<br />
He took the ring off and placed it on his bed, quickly taking the red athletic shorts off his body. Trying not to focus much on his privates, he kicked the shorts to the side and put on his boxers. They came up quite easily, sizes much larger than his new form.<br />
<br />
“Woah, I look like I’m wearing a pair of shorts!” Oliver thought as he viewed the boxers on his body. They were loose and he had to hold them up to prevent them from falling down. It amazed him to see the difference he had with his new body and his old one, filling him with pride as he admired the contrast.<br />
<br />
“I guess I am kinda tall,” he said proudly as he noticed his boxers nearly reaching his knees. “Man I always wanted say that!”<br />
<br />
Focusing on the ring, he placed his boxers back on his bed as he put the ring back on. Enough fooling around! It was time to try something else on.<br />
<br />
Oliver had just had his fill of being a kid so he wanted to try something more mature. Something meant for an adult. A huge jockstrap caught his eye, sticking out of one of his plastic bags. It was white but worn down and yellowed, clearly having been used a decent amount.<br />
<br />
“Perfect!” Oliver thought as he grabbed the jockstrap in his hands. It was enormous in his hands, bigger than the athletic shorts and even his old boxers. This was definitely something meant for a larger man.<br />
<br />
Oliver questioned if the ring would still work if he used it while being someone else but decided to try it anyway. If it didn’t work he would simply turn back into himself and then try it on.<br />
<br />
The jockstrap was a joke on his childish figure. Way, way, way too large. It almost appeared as if he was carrying a rag, the large pouch in front covering him a good amount, as he held it up by the helm around his stomach. But just as before, the changes began instantly.<br />
<br />
Oliver began to grow, his limbs and torso lengthening and widening as he increased in height. His hands adapted to his new stature as his feet elongated, at least until they were about a size 14. His body continued to adjust as it left Oliver with the proper body of a man that stood at 6’ 5”. However, it looked ridiculous with his current childlike appearance, resembling a boy who’d gone through too many growth spurts. But the rest of his body was quickly transforming to match the previous owner of the jockstrap.<br />
<br />
Oliver’s body began to fill with muscles as his arms and legs inflated, becoming bulkier and thicker. His muscle mass continued to increase as his biceps and calves became impressively large, his thighs and deltoids widening. It wasn’t long before his new muscle growth made its way to his torso as his chest expanded. Two huge and beefy pecs forming as his stomach tightened, fat dissolving and replaced with a defined six pack. His body bulged as his muscles continued to expand and grow, giving him an incredibly muscular physique. One suited for a regular member of the gym.<br />
<br />
As his body continued to change, Oliver’s skin tone began to darken. It began to move through different tones, going from pale to olive to tan, until it reached a nice dark brown. As a result the rest of his body changed to suit his new skin color. His bigger nipples becoming an even darker shade of brown as his palms and soles became lighter. His hair turned black as his eyes became a dark brown hue, appearing more darker than his original brown eyes.<br />
<br />
His hair receded on the top of his head as it formed into a buzz cut, the texture of his hair becoming frizzier and curlier. In spite of his manlier appearance, Oliver didn’t grow any more body hair, giving him a glossy appearance. His arms, his legs, his armpits, and anywhere hair was expected to grow had been properly shaved and waxed. Whoever the jockstrap belonged to liked to properly manscape, giving Oliver a nice and smooth body. Regardless, there was still signs of trimmed body hair on him, showing he was capable of producing a decent amount of body hair. <br />
<br />
His face was also properly shaved, leaving no facial hair on his face although his eyebrows became larger and bushier. Clearly they weren’t included in the manscaping. Meanwhile his lips became fuller and plumper as his nose stretched and widen. Oliver’s face began to shift as he took on a new identity, his face becoming more defined. In addition, his jawline turned more angular as his Adam’s apple became more prominent, gifting him a much deeper voice than before.<br />
<br />
The changes began to slow as they reached completion, making its ways to Oliver’s waist. Oliver’s butt expanded and grew as his glutes filled with muscles, leaving him with a nice bubble butt formed from daily sets of squats. Moving to his frontside, Oliver’s black dick grew tenfold as it widened and lengthened, reaching an impressive length of 10 inches at its flaccid state. His ball followed suit, as they dropped and grew larger and heavier. Plenty of testosterone and semen stored within them.<br />
<br />
By now the jockstrap fit Oliver perfectly, hugging his waist as it contained his larger equipment inside. It even felt tight, too small too properly contain the masculine specimen he had become. His cock and balls felt constricted as they bulged against the fabric, pre already leaking from his tip as it stained the jockstrap.<br />
<br />
As the transformation finished, Oliver stood in his much smaller room as a new person: a tall, attractive, and muscular black man wearing nothing but an old jockstrap.</p>
