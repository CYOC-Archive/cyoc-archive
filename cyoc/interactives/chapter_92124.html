<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know James I think you need a taste of your own medicine.  Maybe what we said was kind of mean but you don&#39;t have the right to go around screwing up people&#39;s lives because they say something you don&#39;t like.  It doesn&#39;t teach anybody anything and just reinforces stereotypes.&quot;  James eyes widened in fear, fear that kept him from moving as Jason typed furiously on the device.  What he was planning was long and complicated and he wanted everything to be perfect.  Even though he was pretty new to it and wasn&#39;t the smartest guy on the block Jason was happy with the what he programmed and hit submit with a dramatic press and an evil glare at James.  <br />
<br />
James felt the wave hit him and cringed, ducking down and expecting the worst.  But nothing happened.  &quot;What the hell did you do to me?&quot;  He exclaimed.  Jason just grinned and started laughing before tossing the device back at James who caught it hesitantly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I cursed you to be a &#39;were-breeder&#39; that&#39;s what heterophobic fags like you call us right?  Whatever.  Anyway the fun part is now when you get really turned on. Always at the most awkward moment possible you&#39;ll turn into a random raging heterosexual stereotype maybe a dumb wigger or jock, or some womanizing biker bad boy or maybe even one of those annoying tumblr teens that wants a &quot;qt relationship&#39; but it will always be embaressing and out of your control.  The best part is if you insult a gay guy or girl while you&#39;re transformed you&#39;ll spread the curse to them.  Lesbians will turn into either trophy bimbos or quiet house wives something like that.  Oh yeah and I also made it so that device will never work for you again or work on you so don&#39;t think anyone else can remove it for you.  Have fun!&quot;  James was shaken, he almost wanted to cry but having no idea what to do he fled and skated away.  <br />
<br />
James eventually found himself back at the beach, it was peaceful here and he could relax and think.  Ok so maybe he went a little power crazy.  When you have the ability to change the world in your hand it happens.  He wanted to right wrongs maybe, maybe there was some bitterness from his past.  Maybe he was acting out of vengeance and not understanding but still.  His introspection was interrupted when he saw the gay guys from earlier at the beach.  The same guys who had started everything.  They were still making out and staring soulfully into each other&#39;s eyes.  It was sweet and hot actually and... Oh shit.  James realized his cock was hardening and felt a strange fatigue settle over him.  He gripped a fence for support as he continued to watch those fags kiss.  Wait did he just think of them as fags?  They were people, no different from... Fuck them, they could do that anywhere.  They want to shove their life style in my face and make trouble.  Fucking fags, I cant, I can&#39;t think straight damnit!  His thoughts dissolved into chaos.  He felt his self esteem withering and he knew the only way to protect himself was lash out, it wasn&#39;t cruelty but self defense.  Somehow these queers now penetrated his male identity and he saw them as a threat.  He groaned trying to fight those thoughts but his fear and hatred grew and as they did they manifested across his body.  He felt his muscles beginning to swell and strengthen beneath his clothes causing him to gasp in pain with each breath.  His bones were cracking and expanding in terrible agony.  Every twitch and contortion hurt more than the last as he grew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck this can&#39;t be happening dude!&quot;  James pawed in vane at his device as his hands grew large and calloused.  His fingers thicker and his palms meatier his clumsy hands grew too large and too unsuited for typing or anything that wasn&#39;t football or basketball.  Real guy sports not like soccer or tennis or sissy shit he needed to be a true guy and impress the babes.  He screamed in mental agony as his hip skater clothes changed, clutching desperately at his worn vans as they morphed around his swelling feet going for size 9 to size 13, the material creaking and stretching as it widened and lengthened.  The colors fading to bright fresh off the shelf white and strands of Crimson crawling across the sides as they thickened and spread cross crossing across the white and the Adidas logo formed on them.  Fresh kicks fit for a jock.  For a true jock is what he was becoming.  Beneath his new boat sized athletic shoes his no show socks began their own change.  The black threads crawling up his ankles and reaching up his legs almost to his knees.  His cargo shorts began to change into mesh, lightening to white as the pockets sealed up and vanished and the material softened and thinned out becoming porous and expanded falling down further and sagging quite a bit around his large boxers.  Within those boxers of course his dick was swelling, becoming large and thick and his thoughts rapidly degraded to big boobed cheerleaders and hot bimbos, boning them with giant fuck stick just to prove he could.  James couldn&#39;t help but smile a sick cocky grin which only furthered his humiliation with what he was becoming.  <br />
<br />
The exposed skin between his shorts and socks began to tingle and crawl like a thousand ants as the sparse brown hairs thickened and spread into a veritable coat of soft, downy blond fur that glistened gold in the sunlight and perfectly contrasted his bronzed sports tanned skin.  The hairs curled and spread up beneath his shorts sprouting around his swelling member.  James could only watch with horror and excitement as the changes creeped up his body.  Down across his arms the golden hairs and tan spread and bulging muscles emerged from beneath his skin.  His biceps rippled with strength from pumping iron and hitting the gym with his bros.  The sleeves of his shirt screamed and tore in protest as rips and tears appeared and the material began to fade and fray, shrinking away into nothing.  The sleeves continued to retreat until they vanished and the heavily stylized elements shirt became bleached white and lost all of its designs.  The fabric softened and loosened, growing around his growing frame.  The sides split open more to allow more room to breath and yet also contracted showing much of his chest now.  A scarlet Adidas logo also began to appear on the front.  <br />
<br />
James groaned as his pecs pushed forward digging into the front of his new athletic shirt.  He pulled it up, helpless but to watch as a fine gold treasure trail crawled from his shorts to his belly button and a his stomach carved itself painfully into a set of 8 pack abs hard as stones.  He pounded them with his fist, satisfied with the way they remained sturdy and stalwart.  His back and spine stretched to raise him up to his new height of 6&quot;5 and his shoulders cracked and broader.  His back expanded into an impressive mountain of football jock muscles.  And James trepidation began to subside as his joy and satisfaction with his changing form rose.  The insecurity and deep rooted homophobia became buried in a furious explosion of confidence and need that bellowed from within him like a raging inferno.  He was a proud cocky jock a hot powerful jock.  He couldn&#39;t fight it anymore, feeling his long skater hair lighten to platinum blond and retreat into his scalp to form a masculine jockish crew cut.  His face rearranged to be square and hard, the bones nearly protruding from the flesh.  His eye brows dark and narrow and his scalding bright blue eyes filled with hunger and delivering a shamelessly scorching gaze to the fags at the beach.  With a final gasp of defeat James gave in for now.  He opened his mouth and gave a beautiful shiny white smile to the big open beach.  &quot;Wassup beach!&quot;  He bellowed in a deep authorative new voice.  &quot;It&#39;s miller time bro, gonna score some babes!&quot;  With that he set out to find some bros some beer and some hot babes to pass the day away.  Maybe even put those fucking fags in their place if they didn&#39;t leave his beach... From the distance Jason nodded, sad for the loss of his friends but satisfied he had avenged them.  He left his new monster to its own ends and went home to think.</p>
