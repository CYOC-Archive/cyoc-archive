<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Benton never hated the stew his father prepared in the past; he did resent the fact that it reminded him of a time when his family was not as affluent as it is now. True his father never shied away from work and had a strong work ethic. A trait Benton admired and striven for even as he accumulated a vast fortune that rivals even the most ruthless of individuals such as drug lords and the various warlords running the failed states in Africa and southern Asia. His shrewd business deals and smart investing has made him the envy of everyone of note; always listed on the Forbes fortune five hundred as one of the richest persons in the world.<br />
<br />
So for the sake of Frieda and not wanting to start a pointless fight with his parents over food; Benton accepts the bowl of rabbit stew from his father as he is taking his bi-polar medication. Seeing his brother Lance smile as he drinks in the aroma of the rabbit stew; licking his were-panther muzzle in anticipation of the rich and hearty taste that awaits him. Lila the only were-tigress at the dining table also grinning as she too takes an offered bowl from Anton. Amanda; accepting a bowl of stew from Anton, but still not having any ideal as to what the meat is. She accepts it for the sake of being civil, but still looking at the were-tigress as she quietly seethes inside.<br />
<br />
Eric, Spencer and Frieda each eagerly accept a bowl of rabbit stew; the three purring loudly as they are clearing enjoying the rich gamey smell coming from the rabbit meat. Esmeralda coming into the dining room with a large plate of hot biscuits, still steaming as she places them on the table and then sitting next to her husband.<br />
“Well don’t just stare with your muzzles agape,” Esmeralda taking a bowl from her husband; “grab a biscuit before they get cold.”<br />
“And dig in,” Anton smiling; “and don’t worry, I made plenty for seconds.”<br />
<br />
Lance and Lila did not need to be told twice. Nor did Eric, Spencer and Frieda; the five weres each grabbing a hot biscuit with their paws as they eat the stew. The potatoes absorbing the flavors of the Guinness broth, as the turnips and parsnips provide a nice tart aftertaste. The carrots cutting the tartness with their natural sweetness as the peas floating in the thick broth make the concoction warm and inviting. The rabbit meat melting in their mouths as they chew on the tender and cooked flesh; tails thrashing as they all moan and purr in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Anton and Esmeralda could not help but smile as they see their youngest son and granddaughter enjoy the meal; devouring it with gusto. Seeing Benton silent as he methodically eats his stew; focusing on the vegetables first before eating the meat. Amanda was the only one picking at the stew; while she was generally open to trying new things to eat, there was something to her that seemed off putting with the stew. Whether it was her father in-law preparing the meal or the fact that she could not place the meat, Amanda was having a hard time eating.<br />
“Something wrong,” Anton looking at Amanda; “are you not hungry?”<br />
“I’m hungry,” Amanda keeping her answers quick and simple; “I’m just not sure what meat this is.”<br />
“It rabbit,” Spencer sopping up the broth with the biscuit; “and it happens to be some of the best I’ve had.”<br />
“This is the first time I’ve had rabbit,” Eric purring; “have to say it’s good.”<br />
“You’ve never had rabbit before,” Anton asking; “are you not a naturally born were?”<br />
“No,” Eric answering; “I became a were-panther just less than two weeks ago.”<br />
“We don’t need to get into the deals,” Benton interrupting; “suffice to say, I do not want to have carnal activities discussed while eating dinner.”<br />
“Ah,” Anton smiling as he offers up a sly wink; “I understand.”<br />
“Rabbit,” Amanda blanching; “I’m not sure I can eat this.”<br />
“Amanda,” Benton finishing his first bowl; “please don’t start.”<br />
“Start what,” Amanda looking at her husband; “that I don’t have the same palette as the rest of you? That I’m too refined for such pedestrian food?”<br />
“Remember,” Lila smirking; “you’re the one who said it first.”<br />
“You shut you maw,” Amanda sneering; “I didn’t ask for your opinion.”<br />
“And you are not going to talk to Lila like that,” Lance chiming in; “whether you like it or not, she and I love each other. And last I checked, I don’t need nor require your approval as to who I can date or invite to my bed.”<br />
“You two are living together,” Amanda snorting; “I’m surprised you have room in the hovel you call a home.”<br />
“My home may be small,” Lance growling; “compared to this place, but answer me this. Do you have a spare room made up for mom and dad; because I do.”<br />
<br />
Benton shakes his head as Amanda fuming at Lance’s crack about her hosting skills. Having to place a paw on her shoulder, to get her to sit back down; Benton knew that he forgot to accomplish that simple task before his parents arrived Thursday afternoon.<br />
“I thought so,” Lance snorting; “Benton how could you forget?”<br />
“I did have other issues on my mind,” Benton answers; “Worrying over my daughter for one.”<br />
“Why were you worried for me,” Frieda asking.<br />
“Because Frieda,” Benton answering; “despite our issues, I don’t want to see any harm to come to you. What with what happened yesterday at the council building. Hearing of Julie escaping, I was afraid something might have happened to you.”<br />
“Nothing would of happened to me,” Frieda answering; “not with Eric and Spencer with me.”<br />
“It’s a father’s right,” Benton answering; “to be worried for the wellbeing of his daughter, so please don’t argue with me.”<br />
“That’s very touching,” Esmeralda speaking up; “but Benton, you should have told us you forgot to make up a spare room for us.”<br />
“I wouldn’t fully blame Benton mom,” Lance answering; “Amanda should shoulder some of the blame.”<br />
<br />
Amanda just snorts as she refuses to dignify the jab at her; she just continues to stare a Lila. Lila noticing the icy stare that Amanda is shooting at her decides enough is enough.<br />
“Is there a problem,” Lila speaking up; “did I offend you in some fashion Amanda?”<br />
“You may have everyone here fooled,” Amanda looking at the were-tigress; “but I know you are nothing but a no good gold digging hussy with an eye for the Knight name and fortune.”<br />
If that were the case,” Lila turning the jab around; “then I would be putting the moves on Benton instead of Lance.”<br />
<br />
Amanda shocked that Lila would dare say such a thing; growls, her ears pinned down and clearly ready for a fight. Benton clearly not having any of this grabs his wife and removes her from the dining room table and frog marches her to his study. Everyone looking stunned as they hear Amanda snarl demanding to be let go and  then hearing Benton roaring at her for daring to pick a fight and baiting his brother’s girlfriend into one.<br />
 “Lila,” Lance sighing; “did you really have to say that?”<br />
“Amanda started it Lance,” Lila grabs a second biscuit; “and I’m not going to be cowed by her.”<br />
“Wow,” Frieda listening to her father’s bellowing; “I’ve never heard father argue with mother like that before.”<br />
“Frieda,” Anton sighing; “your mother has always been a snob.”<br />
“Oh I’ve known that for a while now,” Frieda answering; “she is always putting on airs and looking down on everyone.”<br />
“Now it looks like your mother is forced to deal with a person,” Spencer chuckling; “that won’t put up with it.”<br />
“Here here,” Lila smiling; “Amanda will find, I give as good as I get, the advantage of having a younger sibling.”<br />
“I think diner is over now,” Lance hearing no end to the argument Benton and Amanda are having; “I’m sure the stew will be finished off later dad.” Looking at Frieda, Spencer and Eric and smiling; “midnight snack and all.”<br />
“Mother might calm down if she hears you and Lila leave uncle,” Frieda helping with the dishes; “I don’t think you’re going to get an apology from her if you stick around.”<br />
“Probably for the best,” Lance nodding; “mom, dad. You’re more than welcome to stay at my place; I meant what I said that I have a spare room already made up for you.”<br />
“We’ll take you up on that,” Anton smiling; “but I must warn you, your mother and I have gotten quiet noisy with our coupling.”<br />
“That’s okay,” Lila giggling; “Lance and I have no intention of remaining quiet with our rutting.”</p>
