<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle smiled to himself as he realized the wonderful predicament Jennifer created for herself. Kyle now had supreme control over this girl who made his life hell. And he would take full advantage of it. He reached out and dialed her number again hearing it ring through to voice mail. Growing frustrated he. Called again, and again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking... What?!&quot; Jennifer snapped, not fully knowing exactly why she answered at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here you little bitch, I&#39;m not done with you and you&#39;re going to listen!&quot; Kyle snapped, honestly scaring Jennifer more than a little. &quot;I&#39;m going to tell you your dare first. I dare you to immediately after I&#39;m done talking, pass the curse to me and when I ask you &#39;transform or dare&#39; again, you&#39;ll say &#39;Both.&#39; Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you.&quot; She said, starting to get scared as she felt something in her mind shift. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; Kyle smirked. &quot;Now for your transformation, I&#39;m going to turn you into the thing you hate more than anything in this world. A poor, filthy, degraded, street walking hooker, addicted to drugs and cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; Jennifer stammered, fear turning her blood cold. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right Jenny. Say goodbye to the lap of luxury. And say hello to alleyways, humiliation, and public urination. Because you&#39;re going to become exactly the whore I&#39;m imagining right now!&quot; Kyle laughed. Jennifer could already feel a sensation crawling over her skin as he did. &quot;Call me back once you&#39;re ready and we&#39;ll go from there.&quot; And he hung up. <br />
<br />
Jennifer held the phone to her ear for several moments after, shocked by the words she heard. Slowly, she returned the phone to it&#39;s receiver as she noticed something strange. Her nails were growing before her very eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no. That&#39;s impossible.&quot; She hoped aloud. All the while watching as her fingers grew thinner and slightly weathered. Skin growing darker with sun exposure. Her nails growing into long, thick, and cheaply done acrylics painted a gaudy red. Looking at her other hand she saw much of the same, though one of the nails was chipped. Jennifer rushed over to the mirror to watch with horror as the changes continued. Her arms were next, the gentle tone of her cheerleading muscles faded, as did the soft and youthful fat under her skin. Soon becoming more gaunt. The arms of a woman in need of a meal. Skin tight from over tanning. And slowly several dark lines fade in, becoming trashy tribal tattoos and a cursive script saying &#39;Carpay Diam.&#39; the misspelling making Jennifer cringe with embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is happening to me?&quot; Jennifer muttered as the changes started at her feet. Matching nail polish adorns her toes, which are rapidly becoming more callused, toes aching as they turn inward, the Mark of a girl who wears sky high heels all night every night. Her beautiful pale legs grow darker like the rest of her, sun damage appearing as freckles up her shins and thighs. Like her arms they grow thinner, her muscles getting more pronounced. Also like her arms, a bunch of tattoos started to appear on her skin, more generic and trashy tribal patterns, as well as a pair of ribbons tattooed on the backs of her thighs to give the appearance of her wearing stockings. Along her inner thigh, however, a script appeared that made Jennifer&#39;s heart skip a beat and stomach flip. It read &#39;Cum goes here&#39; with an arrow pointing up at her pussy. &quot;No, no, no!&quot; She shouted as she started rubbing at the ink, trying to wipe it away, sadly its as permanent as the curse. <br />
<br />
Next she felt a churning in her stomach. A pang of hunger ate at her and caused her to double over, her new lithe arms wrapped over her beautifully toned cheerleader abs. Soon, those began to fade away, though not being replaced by fat, but simply pulling further in. Pounds shedding off of her in ways she only hoped possible, though progressing further than she&#39;d liked. Her ass and tits followed, as her body fat shed away, pound after pound, looking less like the desirable shape she wanted when she took those diet pills her friend gave her, and more like the girls who skip lunch to smoke cigarettes in the bathroom. The pain subsided as her newly tanned skin started to pull tight over her ribs. Her tits shrinking to a barely noticeable A cup. Her ass flat as well. Hip bones also protruding. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! I look anorexic! I don&#39;t want to look like a skeleton!&quot; She started patting at her ass and chest trying to understand her predicament. &quot;My boobies!&quot; She started to tear up. &quot;No! I just grew those!&quot; Almost as if they heard her, she felt a pain behind her nipples that quickly turned into an expanding pressure. Two large foreign masses started to swell inside her breasts, slightly off-center of where her breasts ought to have been. Large, circular and fake looking, her skin stretched and stretched, nipples expanding and flattening as the cheap as hell implants reached their final expansion, DD cup. Jennifer, growing pale with shock, reached up to touch them, pulling her hand back in fear as she felt how hard and tight they were. &quot;No... my boobs look like... like...&quot; Before she could finish, a similar feeling started in her ass cheeks. The too swelled up to large overly round shapes. Looking at her exaggerated and obviously cheap figure in the mirror, she felt sick. A tramp stamp appeared over her new ridiculous ass, as well as a cheap looking pinup on her ribs. <br />
<br />
Her mind had barely started to process these latest changes when she felt the tingle in her lips. She knew what was about to happen, though she wished she was wrong. The tan and damage spread up her neck and over her face as she noticed a couple of wrinkles appear near her eyes. Less from age, and more from hard living. Her cheeks shrunk in becoming as gaunt as the rest of her, her eyes gained dark circles under them from sleepless nights, and her eyebrows all but vanished into thin, overly arched ones. She held a hand that didn&#39;t belong to her up to her cheek and started to cry, the tear trailing down her now exaggerated cheek bones and over her sharp jaw. The tingling in her lips never ceased though and it was now becoming apparent why. They began to swell, first to a healthy size, then to a pronounced pout, and then further into the same realm of ridiculousness as her tits. The filled up and swelled to the point the began to protrude forward into a duck like pout. Soon, the swelling caused them to part in the middle, no longer pressed together without effort. Her resting face would forever have her sticking her lips out in a pouty &quot;O&quot; shape like a cheap whore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mah wips!&quot; She slurred, unused to the change. &quot;I wook wike a whowa.&quot; The changes to her face didn&#39;t stop there though. Her face soon became caked with makeup, like a woman who painted herself every night without ever remembering to remove it the next day. Her eyebrows became dark with drawn on liner. Her eyes adorned with a trashy blue eyeshadow and clumping mascara. Bright pink blush slapped across her cheeks making her look like a flushed slut. And lastly bright red lipstick and gloss smeared over her new duckbill lips. Jennifer stepped back, black tears streaking down her cheeks. That&#39;s when her hair changed. Bleaching out more and more, gaining damage from all the bleaching and turned into a bright platinum tangle that gathered into two trashy pigtails, completing her new look as a streetwalker. <br />
<br />
Suddenly overwhelmed with need. She picked up the phone and called Kyle. Dreading each dial tone. The line on the other end clicks and answers. &quot;Hello, Jenny.&quot; Kyle smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Twansfom oh dawe?&quot; She managed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... let&#39;s see.&quot; Kyle pretended to muse. &quot;How about dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dawe you to cuwse me back&quot; She said, slowly getting control over her embarrassing new mouth, but now what she was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well Jenny. Transform or dare?&quot; Kyle said with all the menace he could muster. <br />
<br />
&quot;B...&quot; She struggled to fight it, but was unable. &quot;Bof!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle grinned.</p>
