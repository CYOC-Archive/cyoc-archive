<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While was stuck standing in place inanaimately two floors below, Scott was in the bathroom looking at his son&#39;s reflection in a mirror staring back at him in utter disbelief. He obvioisly knew it had worked. His smaller frame was annoying to get used to. He knew he was supposed to be the boy. But it didnt really hit home until he finally looked at his new reflection. <br />
<br />
He was just a kid now! Just a boy! So impossibly young and immature! A kid that needs to be raised and looked after. Cared for, guided, and taught. The very same kid he was, until just a couple of hours ago, partially responsible for! A kid that looked absolutely nothing like him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry! Shower! Now!&quot; Yelled Angela, his now mother up the steps.<br />
<br />
That broke his trance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ok!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I got a lot of stuff to do anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned around, approached the tub, and reached as far as his short, skinny arm of Harry&#39;s ten year body could reach, and turned on the water. He waited until it got warm enough, entranced by his foreign-looking tan little long (but short) skinny fingers. They looked long, only because they were attached to a small child-sized hand. At least Harry didnt bite his fingers, so his fingernails were as perfect as his new hairless tan skin was. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s going to be a handsome man when he grows uo, &quot; Scott thought. &quot;Or,  maybe I will when I....uh....grow up?...Again...?&quot; Perish the thought! He didnt want the awkwardness of puberty again. But he also didnt want the humiliation of being the little boy he now is. With his little boy penis and tiny little balls.<br />
<br />
Scott hopped in the shower, his new thick, dark, wavy hair falling in front of his eyes. While he did still have hair on his head and wasnt going bald, it wasnt nearly this thick. He found he needed a lot of shampoo to wash it. He had to reach up to grab it from the shelf he should be reaching down for. He dropped it, as it was unexpectedly heavier than he thought it should have been. Shampoo went flying out of the bottle. He picked it uo, and squeezed entirely too much out into the palm of his small left hand. <br />
<br />
Ignoring the mess, he washed himself up, theb stepped out of the shower when he was finished. His smooth tan skin was shiny,  especially when it was wet. He examined his new small little hairless body. His privates nothing but a little beanpole with a couple of pea-sized balls up snug against it. He gave it a quick tug. The offending little thing was springy. His face turning red with embarrassment. He still couldn&#39;t believe he waz just a ten year old boy!<br />
<br />
Scott went back to the mirror to confirm a second time. And for a second time, he was shocked by the youthful face of innocence looking back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I cant believe I did this. Im really a ten year old version of the boy!&quot; <br />
<br />
The thought scared his so badly,  he decided to turn back into himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Harry! Dinner&#39;s ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
He then noticed the fresh smell of baked lasagna! His little tummy rumbled. He knew lasagna was Harry&#39;s favorite,  and it smelled even greater than ever!<br />
<br />
&quot;First, I eat!&quot;<br />
<br />
He gathered up the bedtime pajamas he picked out, and got dressed. They were. A bit big.... He then wondered if his mom would notice.....&quot;Mom&quot; coming too easily to his mind, and he never even noticed. It would sure be awkward if she did. How to explain it? <br />
<br />
&quot;Harry! I said dinner&#39;s ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, mom!&quot; he shouted out. <br />
<br />
He took a deep breath and sighed. &quot;Here goes nothing....&quot;<br />
<br />
He trudged down the steep steps, afraid to turn the corner at the bottom of the steps. He did. And the kitchen looked entirely too large. His wife was too big and too old looking to his much smaller and younger eyes. Sheepishly,  he tok Harry&#39;s customary place at the table. He noticed the child-sized portions in disappointment. And those slimy green balls somehow didnt look very appetizing. Tjeyre just brussel sprouts. Scott loved brussel sprouts! But he wasnt Scott any longer. He was Harry,  and stuck with Harry&#39;s tongue and sense of smell. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know where your father is. He never called me-&quot; she stopped in mid-sentence. &quot;Are you feeling alright honey?&quot; she asked with concern. &quot;You look like youve lost some weight.&quot; She came over to feel his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; he chirped in his soft little boy&#39;s voice. But mothers see their young children like Harry as vulnerable, cute little creatures that need to be taken care of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m going to call the doctor and make an appointment for you tommorrow.&quot; Scott&#39;s stomach dropped. Oh no! Theyll confirm the loss of height and weight, and possibly discover the youthening of Harry! Two years makes quite a difference in a young child&#39;s life and physical stature! <br />
<br />
&quot;I cant believe im younger and smaller than the boy!&quot; he thought as he started chowing down on the food in front of him. His mother relented, and she went to her spot to eat.<br />
<br />
There was some small chit-chat. She was asking how his day at school was. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said. &quot;What did you learn?&quot; she asked. &quot;Nothing, &quot; he said. &quot;Nothing? Come on now, you must have learned something!&quot; <br />
<br />
He got about three quarters of the way through the lasagna during the third degree she was giving him, and found he was suddenly full! He couldnt eat any more! <br />
<br />
&quot;Im full!&quot; he announced. &quot;But you never touched your brussel sprouts!&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
Scott crinkled his little nose in disgust. &quot;But im full.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cone on now! You have to eat the vegetables! Look at you! You&#39;ve lost some weight!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; It was just brussel sprouts anyway. He stabbed one with a fork. And immediately spit it out,  half gagging! &quot;That was gross!&quot; he chirped!<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry Matthew Sampsell! That was rude and disgusting! You march your little butt up to bed now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts! Bed! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked up shamefully at the menacing woman. Whatever ego Scott had in his diminished form, quickly evaporated. He stood up,  head down away from that burning gaze,  turned around,  and marched towards the steps like a puppy with a tail between its legs. He went straight to his new room, closed the door, and realized he was just disciplined like the child he had become. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not fair! I don&#39;t like no stupid brussel sprouts, and I was full anyway!&quot; he cried out, and flopped on his bed. He suddenly felt very tired, and passed out.</p>
