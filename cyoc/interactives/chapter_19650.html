<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"Cody, do you want any friends over for your birthday party?" Susan Smith said to her son. Cody said, "No, family's enough." 5 year old Sam said, "Happy Birthday, Big Brother." Cody said, "It's not my birthday yet. There's seven days to go." Sam had some difficulty understanding time and a few hours later he wished him a happy birthday again. He also didn't know why his older brother looked so different from him. In fact he bore no resemblance to neither of his parents. The only thing that looked like his mother's what his ears and nose. In fact, the only way that you could tell that Cody was related was through a DNA test. They could tell that everything else came from his father. His little brother however looked more like his parent's child. Someday Sam would be told, but that would be years from now.Cody Smith was a nice kid in school well liked by many. He played baseball in school and did well in his studies. Life in a little town was better than living in stuffy city, yet over the years, his town was becoming crowded as apparently others thought of the same thing. So maybe moving to a larger city would be best. His birthday was celebrated without much surprise. Then one night soon afterwards, he had the strangest dream he ever had.
He saw a boy that looked exactly like himself. He saw him grow up and go to the past? The young man died 21 years from his present. Then the scene switched with a first person perspective of running swiftly through the forest. Then he saw the full moon and heard an unnatural hiss. It all seemed so real.He woke up and was troubled by the dream, but didn't tell anyone. His brother had woken up first and started to put his things in his backpack for school. His mother dropped his little brother off at Elementary School and then dropped him off at Junior High. Next year, he'd be moving on to High School and he was so excited. That night, he ate more than what he usually ate for supper and his mother said, "Stop wolfing it down." His father said, "He's a growing boy. Let him be." After supper,Cody went up to his room to do his homework. Cody had homework that took a while to complete. Suddenly he was gripped with burning pain and he fell out of his chair. It was more intense than the time that he broke his leg after falling from a tree. He screamed out in pain as his vocal cords changed. His little brother was too terrified to do anything but cowered in the corner in extreme fear as he heard his brother's screaming turn from sounding human to something not quite human, but not quite animal. Cody's body then underwent horrifying changes that were very overwhelming. Black striped scales started to sprout all over his green scaly skin. His t-shirt bulged and started to tear. His tennis shoes split as his legs started to fuse together. Two fangs now sprouted up from the top of his mouth dripping with poison. As he felt the pain to his head his ears started to shrink into his head and his eye's now turned green and yellow. His Hands couldn't move any longer they were fusing into his ribs. After his legs had fused together a tail started to form. The tail grew to 10 ft in length. His muscles now moved around growing bigger. The transformation was complete. He thought he'd faint, but the pain stopped before he could. He was weak from the changes that he had difficulty standing. He slowly slithered to the mirror while his vision adjusted. Everything he saw was monochrome, his vision was just as sharp if not sharper. Sounds and smells now bombarded his nose. He then saw his reflection in the mirror. He was now a 10 foot Anaconda mixed with a Python. With his new smells and senses Cody slithered out of the room and into the woods near his house. Cody smelled food nearby, it had been a big deer. Cody slithered quietly up behind the deer and struck. He sank his poisonous fangs into the deers side and then wrapped his prey up tightly in his coils until the deer couldn't struggle no more. Then he flexed his mouth open and started swallowing the deer whole.</p>
