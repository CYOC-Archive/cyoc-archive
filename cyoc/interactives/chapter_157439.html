<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen roared again as she lumbered towards the amazed onlookers. Many of them stepped back or took cover, fearing that the enclosure’s protective screens wouldn’t contain the terrifying monster. Screams echoed out as the dragoness sprayed fire against the glass, clearly hoping to cook the pesky human spectators.<br />
<br />
But sadly the protective screen held like it had before, causing Jen to become further enraged. She tried slamming her tail against the glass, but again she failed to dent it. She even tried crushing the screen with her massive razor-sharp teeth, but this too had no effect.<br />
<br />
As it became apparent that the dragon was safely contained, the members of the crowd started to grow more confident. The cameras soon came out again as they took thousands of close-up shots of the fearsome dragoness.<br />
<br />
Mrs Patterson said nothing for a bit as she let the crowd appreciate the fascinating creature.<br />
<br />
As for Jen, her fury seemed to grow with each unsuccessful attack. As well as this, the feeling in her gut was getting worse. She knew that it was only a matter of time before her eggs arrived, and this extra humiliation only added to her blood-boiling anger.<br />
<br />
The display was finally interrupted as Patterson moved along with her tight schedule. An intricate crane mechanism activated overhead, bringing a large cow carcass into the enclosure so that it dangled above Jen’s head.<br />
<br />
“Now ladies and gentlemen, I think we’d better give Jen a reward for her performance so far.” Patterson smiled as she watched the dragoness eyeing-up the meal hungrily. “I think our gorgeous dragoness has earnt herself a treat, please give it up for Jen everybody!”<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered as the carcass was released, landing straight in Jen’s giant maw. Soon she had greedily swallowed the delicious meal, which seemed to cure her frustration for the time being. <br />
<br />
“Right then ladies and gentlemen,” Patterson continued, “time for the main event. Please give a warm round of applause for Max!”<br />
The arena was filled with clapping and cheering as the enclosure’s large heavy doors opened slowly. The noise grew as Max slowly emerged.<br />
<br />
Max’s arrival stirred new emotions in Jen. A deep draconic lust settled over her as she remembered the fun they had had together last night. The way he teased her sensitive cloaca and the way he slipped his massive dick inside her and filled her with his sperm had been glorious. Her whole body shuddered as her pussy started to drip in anticipation. She wanted Max more than anything!<br />
<br />
The crowd giggled and pointed as the dragoness stood up and raised her tail to her mate. The humiliation of hearing the audience laughing at her only added to Jen’s sexual frustration. If they could just get it over with then they would stop making fun of her!<br />
<br />
Jen’s heart therefore skipped a beat when she felt Max’s forked tongue flicking against her exposed vent. She moaned and hissed as the tongue tickled her sensitive mound. More feminine juices dribbled out of her slick opening as Jen’s body readied itself for some action.<br />
<br />
However, rather than mounting her, Max continued to tease her for longer than he ever had before. His tongue was now buried inside her vent, eagerly flicking in and out of her as he tasted her sweet reptilian arousal.<br />
<br />
The intense sensations sent strong jolts of pleasuring coursing through her body. The sensations focussed deep inside her as her egg chamber started to release its precious load. Jen shuddered as she felt several large objects shifting around inside her. Max withdrew his tongue as Jen instinctively squatted down, just in time to release her first egg into the soft sand of the arena floor. <br />
<br />
For once the crowd was fairly quiet as they studied the dragoness in awe. They watched in amazement as they saw a second egg stretching her cloaca wide before landing in the sand below.<br />
<br />
As for Jen, she was feeling a strange mix of emotions. The feeling of squeezing her eggs through her sensitive passage was oddly pleasurable, if a little uncomfortable. She also felt an animalistic sense of pride now that her mission to reproduce had been fulfilled.<br />
<br />
In the meantime Mrs Patterson watched silently, not wanted to disturb Jen when she was doing such a good job. Seeing the arrogant doctor reduced to nothing but an egg-laying, money-making, beast under her control was incredibly satisfying.<br />
<br />
By the time Jen was finished she had laid seven eggs in a neat flower-shaped arrangement in the sand. Still guided by her instincts, Jen instinctively curled around her eggs protectively, eliciting various ‘oohs’ and ‘ahhs’ from the fascinated spectators.<br />
<br />
After letting the scene sink in, Patterson finally resumed. “There, wasn’t that lovely, the only dragon eggs anywhere in the world ladies and gentlemen!”<br />
<br />
Jen managed to block out the crowd as they applauded yet again. She was tired and relieved to have safely laid her eggs. Now she could look forward to a well-earned rest watching over her new children. At least that would be the case if Max weren’t there...<br />
<br />
“Oh hang on everyone,” Patterson continued with a chuckle, “it seems Max wants to make his family even bigger!”<br />
<br />
Jen looked up to see what the woman was talking about, only to spot Max’s full erection as he looked at her expectantly. Seeing the massive organ sent intense jolts of pleasure to her reptilian vent, making it throb and drip in need. Jen wanted to fight it; she couldn’t debase herself in front of all of these people!<br />
<br />
However, once again her body took the decision away from her. Slowly the dragoness rose to her tired legs as she roared out a deep guttural mating call. Then she presented herself again, lowering her body and raising her tail, ready to surrender to her mate’s will.<br />
<br />
As predicted, Max was on her in a flash. Soon he was busy ramming his giant dick into her tender reptilian vent as he brutally claimed her for himself. Jen wanted this to be over with so that she could snuggle up with her freshly-laid clutch. To that end she pushed back against him, allowing the tip of his massive member to reach the deepest corners of her pussy.<br />
<br />
The two dragons blew smoke from their nostrils and flapped their wings as their tempo reached a fever pitch. Loud wet squelches rang out around the arena as Max’s advancing dick compressed the mixture of juices that had gathered in Jen’s passage, forcing the excess out around the base of his shaft as he spread her wide open.<br />
<br />
The two monsters started to roar and hiss loudly as they both reached a mind-numbing orgasm. The crowd cheered as semen exploded out of Jen’s stretched cloaca, whilst both dragons unleashed long streams of fire as they finished together. Max stayed inside his mate’s warm snatch until the last dribbles of his sperm had landed in her abused orifice. Then he unceremoniously dismounted, leaving Jen dripping cum as she came down from the high of her wonderful climax.<br />
<br />
“And there we have it folks,” Mrs Patterson announced gleefully, “be sure to visit again soon. After all, Jen’s going to be laying again before too long! Thank you ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the rest of your visit!”<br />
<br />
With that, another loud round of applause rang out from the crowd. After this the spectators were ushered out. The two dragons could finally have some rest… at least until the afternoon performance.<br />
<br />
And that was how Jen’s new life as a dragoness carried on for a long while. She was now on display seven days a week, there simply to amuse the vast crowds with her body. Whether she was terrifying the guests, laying more eggs, or full-on mating, Jen was nothing but an entertaining spectacle. The humiliating routine wore Jen down until there was nothing left of the cruel doctor, just the horny dragoness that was now the Menagerie’s star attraction.</p>
