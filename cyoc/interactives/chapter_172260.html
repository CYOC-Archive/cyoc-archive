<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes, please stick it in!&quot; I begged.<br />
&quot;Shove it in me, please!&quot; Cried Tash at the same time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, are you sure you want me to do that?&quot; Jackie said mischievously. However neither of us could stop ourselves from shouting &quot;Yes&quot; in response. &quot;Ok, but don&#39;t blame me for what happens next.&quot; The witch said deviously as she pushed the entire length of the dildo into the fleshlight. <br />
<br />
The two of us collapsed to the ground simultaneously, as our legs gave out due to the pleasure. Our minds had become diluted with the nonsensical amounts oc pleasure that we both no longer cared much about decency and had begun to strip as best as our writhing bodies could. It took a while but we managed to work together to remove each others clothing since both of us were struggling to take our own off without masturbating. <br />
<br />
Our biggest mistake that day however would be when Tash begged me to stick my real dick inside of her, which of course I did without hesitation. Our bairly conscious minds blacked out with an additional 50% more pleasure was added on top of the already 200%. The thing was that until either our real bodies or the sex toy voodoo versions were seperated, we never would regain consciousness again. This was what the witch was aiming for with her plans today. Now that we were both incapacitated, she quickly bound us together to ensure we wouldn&#39;t accidentally seperate, and also taped the toys together as well. Jackie went into a closet and fetched a potion she had made a while ago and force fed it to both of us. The extremely powerful potion would preserve our health and reduce our metabolisms for a span of 1 year so that we wouldn&#39;t die like this. With now a year&#39;s worth of time, Jackie began to work on us.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
I woke up on a table in the witch&#39;s house exhausted. And the moment I opened my eyes, I saw Tash&#39;s sleeping face directly in front of me begin to move as well as she opened up her eyes too. I could feel a warm sensation around my dick when I suddenly remembered what we had done and quickly pushed Tash off of me as she too became quite aware of our current position and tried to do the same. <br />
<br />
However, that action had made it abundantly clear that something was definitely wrong with me. As I felt something pull out of my body. Looking over myself, nothing seemed out of place though, so I was confused. That was when Jackie made her presence also known. &quot;Good evening the two of you. Have a good nap?&quot; She said while bairly keeping herself from laughing. &quot;Fuck, what happened to us?&quot; Asked Tash. &quot;Its rather simple. You both passed out due to pleasure overload. And, I have been rather busy while you both slept and have managed to finally, successfully complete one of my long time goals. Oh, but don&#39;t hold back your applause. As you should also cheer for your successful and extremely importaint participation in the experiment too. Without you guy&#39;s willingness to take it to as far as you did, this never could have happened.&quot; Both me and Tash looked at eachother, confused by what the witch was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you are confused. Not surprising as you were unconscious for almost the entirety of it. So let me do a little recap. I bet that when you just seperated a moment ago, you felt an unexpected feeling, correct? Well get use to it. I have successfully copied and transplanted a &quot;phantom sex organ&quot; of each of you on to the other. You cant see them bit you can certainly feel them. Let me demonstrate.&quot;Jackie walked over to me and pushed her fingers against the skin beneath my balls, causing both me and Tash to moan in pleasure as I could feel her fingers enter something which didn&#39;t exist. &quot;This is your new pussy, and while it is just surface deep, if I do this&quot; she said, now sticking her fingers deep into Tash&#39;s pussy. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can feel the difference.&quot; She was right. I could feel her fingers penetrate deep inside of me, causing me to feel a ton of new things. This was especially made apparent when Tash came. I could feel myself orgasming, and yet my dick had almost no reaction, and not a drop of cum escaped from it, yet I could feel a wet liquid begin to trail down my ass and pool onto the table. Looking down, there was infact a clearish liquid, flowing right out of my skin as if it didn&#39;t exist and was instead a hole.<br />
<br />
Now freaking out, I tried to move but the witch grabbed my dick and began stroking it. For some reason this felt extremely good, and no longer could I will myself to keep moving away. It was only a few seconds later that I cam, shooting cum onto the table in front of me. <br />
<br />
To Tash, it was her turn to be surprise now. She could feel every inch of my cock as if it was poking out in front of her. And when I came, white cum appeared out of thin air and sprayed out in front of her too. &quot;Holy shit this is insane!&quot; Cried Tash, trying to grasp the non-existent cock she felt she had. &quot;Oh it gets even better dear&quot; said the witch as she directed our attention to another table in the room, on which sat 3 sets of 4 items in 3 different colors. 3 dildos, 3 breast forms, 3 fleshlights, and what appeared to be 5 ass moulds. Each of the items had one blue, one pink, and one black version, with the exception of the asses that had 2 blue and 2 pink. &quot;These are copies of all of your sexual parts, and there is a matching set of every piece for both of you. The black versions are universal, while the pink ones effext only you Tash&quot;. &quot;And the blue effect only me right?&quot; I say for her. &quot;Yes, exactly! Great job at figuring that out by yourself.&quot; Jackie wasn&#39;t being condescending either. She really was happy that you could understand so quickly as it would be less of a hassle for her to explain everything.<br />
<br />
Now that you knew what basically was going on, you finally became aware that for this entire time, that you have actually been feeling an odd weight on your chest. Now you figured that this must be from your copy of Tash&#39;s breasts. This would take a lot of getting use to, but it also felt kinda nice in a weird way because they moved with your on body, and not simply mirrored Tash&#39;s origional pair. Plus you could even feel a breeze on them as it teased your nipples. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, these black ones are all for me to keep for my own fun. However, I am giving each of you a set of your missing pair.&quot; She hands you all of the pink parts and does the same for Tash with the blue ones. <br />
<br />
&quot;I should also let you know about a more serious matter though. And you may want to prepare yourselves because it is kind of grim. Just for you two though, not for me. It has been 1 full year since you both passed out, and to the rest of the world, you are both dead, having died together in a tragic land slide almost 11 months ago. So, I guess I am asking what will both of you do now? And before you answer, I would like to offer both of you a permanent residency here, and you both would become my assistants. I also would advise not going back to your old lives as you both have already been confirmed to be dead. So if you went back, you may end up inside of a poorly lit room in a federal building somewhere being questioned as to why you faked your own deaths. Not to mention tax evasion charges.&quot;</p>
