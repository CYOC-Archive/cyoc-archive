<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      I woke up my stomach felling like it was full of butterflies, it was the first day of the school year and I would be going as a girl. The only thing calming me down was the fact that I knew a few of the girls on the cheerleading team, that made it better slightly. I got out of bed and went straight to the bathroom quickly pulling down my pants and undies I sat down on the toilet peeing before I sat down completely. I finished up and took off my top standing naked in the mirror. I smiled, even though it had been months since I had changed I still couldn&#39;t get over how much better I felt being a girl, the old me the boy wouldn&#39;t have been able to pee like that first thing in the morning v&quot;fuck morning wood and everything it came with&quot; I mutterd to myself as I got the shower ready.<br />
      Freshly showered I walked to my room towel around my chest. I picked out a cute outfit for the first day of school, a tank top with the female symbol between the breasts and a pair of shorts but not to short because stupid rules and such, I finished up to outfit with my favorite pair of bright pink shoes and my bag and went down to breakfast. &quot;Looking good sis you ready for school&quot; &quot; yeah just a bit nervous&quot; &quot;alww about what&quot; &quot; being around other girls I saw how they could be last year&quot;. Melissa hugged me from behind&quot; you have three older sisters to protect you, don&#39;t worry about anything&quot;. We finished breakfast and got in the car and headed to school.<br />
      The front of the school was packed with students, everyone was finding their friends and grouping up, I got out of the car and walked around until I found Amy and the other girls I joined the group while glancing around for James. We talked about the upcoming school year and the plans for the team, our conversation ended when the school bell rang and everyone reluctantly headed inside. I went to my home room and picked a seat, my heart flutterd I was in the same homeroom as James. I picked a seat next to him putting my bag under the chair. James glanced at me and smiled.<br />
         The final bell of the day rang and I went to my locker to get my uniform for practice. I stood outside the locker room and took a deep breath before pushing the door open and walking inside. It was definitely cleaner than the boys locker room had been I passd a row of stalls smiling at the thought of never using a urinal again. Going around the corner I was greeted by the sight of several girls in various stages of undress. I put my bag on the bench and began to undress. Amy came over to me and put her bag down next to mine&quot; it&#39;s only the first day and I already have homework&quot; she undressed down to her underwear and pulled out her cheerleading uniform&quot; today should be easy just basic warmups and going over to routines&quot; I nodded and pulled up my skirt and put on my shoes&quot; I&#39;ll meet you outside&quot; &quot; ok&quot;.<br />
       I headed outside and took a seat in the bleachers while I watched the boys from the football team warm up. I looked for James and saw him running laps, I watched him for a while admiring his athleticism. The rest of the girls and a few boys grouped up around the coach and Amy as practice began. After two hours practice was done, I was exhausted and sweaty all I wanted to do was take a shower and go home. I followed the girls back into the locker room and everyone underessed tossing their uniforms on to the floor or bags. I stripped down completely feeling perfectly comfortable being naked around the other girls, I got my soap and shampoo and headed to the shower. <br />
       As I lathered up in the shower I looked around checking out the other girls naked bodies. Breasts big and small with smooth flat groins, some shaved some not and everyone was comfortable being naked around others so much different than boys. I finished up and dried off stuffing everything into my bag and getting ready to leave. I walked out the doors going back into the school and saw James talking to his friends. I walked up behind him and hugged him wrapping my arms around his chest. &quot; Hi babe you miss me&quot;. He turned around and kissed me on the cheek&quot; of course I did how was practice?&quot; &quot; Long and sweaty how about you?&quot; &quot; About the same, wanna come over tonight? We could work on our homework together.&quot; &quot; Sure just let me text my mom and sisters&quot; I pulled my phone out and quickly sent a message to everyone letting them know I was going to James&#39;s house, mom texted back ok and Melissa sent a eggplant emoji with a evil face asking me if it was biology homework.<br />
      We walked to his house was leaning against him holding his hand the entire way. When we got there his parents were still at work so he let himself in and I followed. He turned to me again and pulled me close ok into a kiss, I submitted to him as his hands moved down my back and grabbed my butt gently. We made out passionately, he moved and pressed me against the wall his mouth never leaving mine. After what felt like forever we broke apart gasping for breath. He smiled at me and looked at the bathroom. &quot;Wanna help me pee again?&quot; &quot; You want me to aim or swallow?&quot; I asked him as I headed into the bathroom&quot; you really wanna drink it again?&quot; I sat down on the edge of the tub &quot; it really wasn&#39;t that bad but if you just want me to aim for you that&#39;s fine&quot; he unzipped his pants and pulled out his erect penis&quot; can you even pee like that?&quot; He nodded&quot; I can it&#39;s just harder&quot; I stood next to him and grabbed his penis and with some difficulty aimed the stiff shaft towards the toilet bowl.<br />
       James slowly started peeing, just a trickel at first it sprayed everywhere including my bare legs as he did his best to pee with a erection. After a minute he stopped pee still dripping from his penis.&quot; Doesn&#39;t work so well when it&#39;s hard does it&quot; I asked &quot; not really&quot; I led him away from the toilet and sat down on the tub again placing his penis against my lips tasting the remaining pee. &quot; How about I help you with that?&quot; &quot; Please I&#39;ve been horny all day&quot; I took his length into my mouth, swirling my tongue around the tip. I took the entire length pressing my nose against his stomach as a warm wetness seeped into my panties, I started slurping softly on his penis feeling the smooth skin rubbing against my lips as drips of drool fell from my mouth. James moaned and gently grabbed my hair pulling my head closer. He must&#39;ve been extremely horny because it didn&#39;t take long before he shrudderd and blew his load into my mouth. Creamy hot cum flooded my mouth coating my tongue, I kept sucking on his penis milking him for every last drop. He finally pushed me away as he struggled to stand his penis softening before my eyes.  I swallowed a few times to get the rest of his cum from my mouth&quot;feel better?&quot; James sat down on the toilet his penis hanging limply on his balls&quot; fuck Tammy that was incredible, I hope I didn&#39;t hurt you when I pushed you off it just started to hurt at that point&quot; it didn&#39;t don&#39;t worry.&quot; i stood up dropping my shorts and panties&quot; your turn and don&#39;t skimp out on the tongue this time&quot;<br />
        I laid down on the cool tile floor spreading my legs for James, he laid down on his stomach his mouth inches away from my dripping pussy. I started by licking my slit and placing his hands on my thighs. He worked his way in deeper, using his tongue to continue his explanation of my women hood, I closed my eyes as waves of warmth and pleasure raidited form my pussy until I felt like I was going to explode. I climaxed suddenly and forcefully my cum squirting from my pussy and across James face. He pulled back in supprise his mouth open&quot; h- holy shit that&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever done that, I&#39;ve never squirted anything like that before&quot; James licked his lips and sat down next to me on the floor&quot; I didn&#39;t know girls could do that&quot; &quot; I did , just never did it myself until now&quot; I sat up leaning against him&quot; we should get dressed before your parents get home&quot;.</p>
