<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny grinning away “Like I wish all these other cars weren’t on the road unless they are total hotties at the wheel, whooo!”  <br />
Reality altered further now the DMV additionally did face mapping as a superficially brutal test where your face had to be an acceptable level of symmetrical and declared to be at least ‘a 6 out of 10’ by the most judgmental and petty programming possible rumored to utilize assorted chunks of brain from Simon Cowell, Fran Horowitz, and Howard Hughes. Cassie’s ID dissolving into nothingness and being replaced with a no drivers as Jen’s intoxicating bright blue eyes began twitching  lightheaded before smirking smugly falling into a vast ego trip punched on the gas topping the car’s speed and heading towards the Oregon- California line ignoring her nervous assistant Cassie as she started trembling grasping the handles of her sports car afraid of and logistically unable to lecture her boss and former mother knowing that her assistant couldn’t get her own license because of her body and pimples. Knowing that if her boss got fired she would never be able to someday save up enough for the necessary plastic surgeries to be able to drive instead of always trying to get a ride somewhere pleaded with her boss.<br />
“M-miss Jen please don’t be cross but Mr. Steinway already said you’re on thin ice..”<br />
Jenny although well on her way to becoming a megalomaniacal conceded ditz vaguely shining of feelings a twinge of guilt towards her somehow feeling like she was the daughter that she never got to have not knowing that the ring was becoming corroded not working like before as it was now corrupting her thoughts and clouding her memories. began turning her slow indulgent wheels in ways to make it up to her. <br />
“Y’know, I wish old Steinway was sweet on me, bought us fitted Chanel swimsuits and was taking us out to Venice Beach in his limo.”<br />
Tingling Jen found her self floating in empty space momentarily her tight and skimpy clothes ripping and tearing becoming a very revealing and iconic blue Chanel vintage 1995 bikini Custom tailored and individually designed for the dimensions of both her and her assistant’s bodies, Cassie’s not doing her any favors as it clung to her scrawny shapeless body Jen willed for her melting her curves and height, her juicy double D breasts into AA cups.<br />
<br />
Jen spaced out negative side effects plaguing her ring altering her reality and brain, eroding her sense of honor, conscience and ethics as she was on a form of auto pilot mindlessly digging at the camel toe that formed in her very tight bikini bottoms turning herself on she unthinkingly slipped her hand into her bottoms causing the adjustments become masturbation as her and Cassie were completely unaware floating oblivious Cassie  busy self involved distressed as she was unable to thread together the smattering of disconnected memories and Jen becoming busy being self involved, competitive and spoiled as the last remains of her personality and memories becoming radically shifted this time strangely remembering living four millennia ago and ruling her own dimension feeling pissy, venal, wicked, petty, unbelievably narcissistic and feeling slighted  with it becoming rapidly worse her brain reformatting as Bob Steinway, his limo and a driver formed around them seamlessly a sapphire martini forming in Jen’s hand that she wasn’t using to dig into her vagina of the rings actions a power from forces unknown restricting their perception and finishing corrupting the woman wearing it.<br />
<br />
Cassandra was the first to come to feeling off as she was looking at her boss digging into her genitals like that was causing an odd stirring inside of her. Bob Steinway’s cheap big and tall suit Vanishing from his fat, veiny, saggy, and gross old body with saggy balls and a bent 80 degree angle penis on his old body in the blink of an eye his underwear warping and altering becoming a comfortable pair of designer board shorts as he snapped to and spoke looking amused and growing erect his wang hardening into a boomerang.<br />
“Damn Jen, I don’t even have cameras rolling this is just a private show from my top earner for me and twigs over there haha I mean you are absolutely gorgeous and...” <br />
<br />
Cassandra looking down dejected while Jennifer on the other hand was becoming a self obsessed egomaniac feeling pissed and tired of being told what to do Her overriding presence overriding their bonds flashed energy through Jen’s eyes enveloping the car in the discharge of a flash grenade a swat team member might use had the divider not been up Lance the hunky hyper handsome driver would’ve been blinded temporary and possibly crash the vehicle. A magenta pheromone heavy enchanted steam began emanating off of Jen’s vagina falling away in misty whisps. Upon smelling it it had the unique affect of driving Bob and Cass devotedly nuts for her strangling their brains and suffocating it in her unique blend of enchantment and oxytocin. A malevolent voice in the back of her head kept manipulating her going on a long bolstering rant about her worthiness of everything she desires, how she the most important person in Bob Steinway’s retinue and even the world destined to reshape it. Sneering sick and tired of being told a house great she was by her sycophant boss as him and Cassandra vying for her attention giving her immense satisfaction as her mind was more the dark forces than herself, snapping to attention her mouth and motions moving jerkily losing control of her body and voice seamlessly having let the spirit dominate her will, her voice temporarily becoming an animalistic deep growl during the wording of the wish.<br />
“Like, I wish Bobby dissolved into a pile of money and jewelry with nobody remembering him while everyone remembers me  always having all of his stuff, his business in the piles of money in his bank account.”<br />
The old man suddenly stopped mid-sentence looking pallid with a green twinge and began  coughing up a couple crumpled up dollar bill gasping and wheezing he began panicking at his fat saggy body goes limp and his legs began to fritter away becoming shiny jewelry ranging from baubles to a diamond double the size of the ‘cullinan’ making it the world’s biggest diamond. The green patches that head over took in his upper half of his body began turning into a currency out of the morphing fleshy chunks peeling his last muffled pleas falling on deaf years before the silence as Cassandra, Jen, and even Lance completely forgot about him. Cass helped Jenny count her money as she was too busy trying on an intricate in a mirror.<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile a middle aged woman named Elizabeth who ran a teaching circle in the woods had sensed the balance shift and while tracking down abused magical goods are not usually her responsibility being an apothecary and enchantress but she saw vaguely that something deeply troubling was going to tear its way into this reality, Not wasting any time the woman summoned Her two fellow middle aged  enchantresses their brooms zooming off at supersonic speed’s using their connection to the supernatural to track down the ring’s magic signature. Zooming in the sky overhead temporarily cloaked by temporary invisibility spell since the corroded ring emanating from the back of a limo hummer pulling into the parking lot of Venice Beach. Not recognizing possessive spiritual energies but seeing a small trace signature on Jen’s hand she assumed that a good natured  Cassandra must’ve changed herself into the wealthy skank. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately Jen and the very terrifying presence in her head saw the girls coming a mile away. Jumping from her subconscious back into the control seat the ominous presence effortlessly ripped them out of the air uncloaking them in the process the other two girls smashing into a red paste on the pavement while Elizabeth remained constricted in the air well the spoiled slutty woman exerted immense powers that the ring would have required audible wishes for. Gasping for air Elizabeth struggle to get out her words “It’s exactly what the p-premonition said, The Djinn Dybbuk!” <br />
<br />
Booming in growling laughter Jen’s body pretty much a sock puppet having been corrupted over time to have no restraint or resistance.<br />
“Correct Lizzie it is I the last genie Having survive through selfishly harnessing my power by devouring spirits of Oni and Dybbuks”<br />
Catching the woman in the last stages murmuring out of the corner of her mouth the two congealed red paste puddles began slowly building up reforming bone, muscle, and sinew. Before the two girls got their comeback  the busty demented possessed Bimbo hurled a fire ball disintegrating the reforming physical material to ash.<br />
<br />
“Clever girl! But I’m older than time itself speaking of that!”<br />
<br />
Jen secondhand art out lightning suspended which rise has her clothes became feathers falling off her body followed soon after by what was a rapid deterioration. The 40 something-year-old appearing woman begin rapidly aging putting weight through her 70s and 80s becoming a centurion in minutes her leather withering skin Becoming gray as her wispy white hair all fell out as she neared the thousand year marker. The weathering demented skeletal remains turned to dust fluttering on the breeze. After the three intercepting women had been taken care of the demon straightened the crown that Jen had placed on her head before disappearing out of her. Causing the three people to come to Lance and Cassandra looking around bewildered while corrupt Jen returning to her body decided to...</p>
