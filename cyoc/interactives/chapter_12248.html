<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony felt the wave of electricity pass through him, his shoulders rubbing against Jack's to his right and Jeff's to his left.  He felt his body shrinking just a bit and as it was reshaping, he looked down and saw his pubic hair becoming bright orange.  He laughed.  There was no mystery about who he was becoming.  He saw his penis shrink and felt his buns lose muscle and flatten.  He lost just short of two inches height, but Tony was fine with the changes just the same.  Physically, he was now his friend Jack.<br />
<br />
Almost as interestingly, he had Jack's memories available to him if he thought hard enough.  He also seemed to have some of Jack's temperment.  Maybe that was partly the result of body chemistry.  Whatever the cause, Tony's mood immediately improved upon his body being transformed into Jack's.  <br />
<br />
Actually, everyone was in a good mood, excited at the prospect of seeing life through the eyes of one of their friends but Eric, suddenly morphed into the body of 115 pound Mark.  Eric kept complaining and asking for the shuffle of bodies to be done over, but Jeff, in Tony's old body, got him to drop it.  Tony pulled on his new 'Jack' clothes and after everyone got their marching orders from Jeff now in Tony's old body, to do their best in whatever they do in their new body and to stay in character of who they appear to be, he left with now 260 pounder Jack, an Eric duplicate.<br />
<br />
Tony walked through the streets with Jack and marveled at every word out of his mouth.  It was completely Jack's voice.  They neared Jack's house and Tony thought to ask &quot;Hey, what plans do you have for the weekend?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, you're going with my folks to visit Aunt Helen, but hey, you could have found that out yourself, couldn't you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it's kind of hard going through your memories.  Jeff said it's supposed to get easier as you do more of it but I just started.  Oh well, here goes&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony walked through the front door of the Sullivan house.  It was a modest home not much different from his own.  Tony had met Jack's parents lots of times before, but never as Jack.  Mrs. Sullivan saw her son Jack come through the door and waved him to approach her.  When he got beside her, she hugged him and gave him a little pat on his flat rear.<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey what?&quot; demanded his mother.  Tony soon found that the Sullivan family was quite different from the St. Martin family.  Tony watched some tv before washing up and looking at his pale, freckle specked face and body in the bathroom mirror.  It was a good body, well toned if not muscular and it was an attractive face so long as you didn't mind that it was framed by bright red wavy hair.  Mr. Sullivan came up from behind and gave his son Jack, actually Tony, a hug as he brushed his teeth.  Mrs. Sullivan came and tucked him in after the lights were out, too.  <br />
<br />
The next morning, he got a breakfast made just as he liked it (french toast, not scrambled eggs, which perplexed Mrs. Sullivan) more pats on the back goodbye from both parents as he went off to school.  Tony almost felt like skipping to school in this new body.  He laughed and joked all day long, with Eric, actually Jack and with Tony, actually Jeff.  Jeff said that Eric was really pissed about having to go to ballet class as 13 year old Mark.  They all shared a laugh about that.  &quot;Too bad&quot; added Mark in his new Jeff body.  &quot;I'm, I mean he's really frigging good at it.  I-he's the perfect shape for it just like the TransDem Labs guy told Tony.  Hell, he'll look better in his spandex than 'Eric' here will with his fat rear crammed into a football uniform!&quot;  They all had some more laughs about the situation.  There were so many interesting facets to it.  Tony took a math test as Jack.  Hmmm.  Maybe a way to deal with the SAT's?  He wondered if he should do as well as he figured Jack would or as well as he could.  He did his best.  If Jack's grade improves, good for him.<br />
<br />
Right after school, Tony gathered his stuff and went home.  He didn't stay for Jack's first football game as Eric or Eric's first ballet performance as rising ballet star Mark.  He and his parents were leaving to visit Aunt Helen.  Tony was packing some clothes in a bag when Mr. Sullivan happened by his room.  &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; he chuckled.  <br />
&quot;Just packing some clothes, um, Dad&quot;<br />
&quot;To visit a nudist camp?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's what Tony found out was meant by visiting Aunt Helen.  His new parents drove down state to what seemed to be just another campground site.  It certainly looked like one at night time but it was the Sunnyback Naturist Center.  Tony remembered Jack's story of never wearing clothes as a kid until he'd moved to town at the age of 8.  He'd never doubt it again.  At Mr. Sullivan's insistence, Jack stripped off his clothes at the gate.  Until they drove out of there late Sunday, Tony found himself naked as a jaybird in his new Jack body.  The camp had almost 300 people staying there.  The first evening, Tony got out of the car in his 5'11&quot; 160 pound body and had to go into the recreation center in front of what seemed like all 300.  Somehow the fact that it wasn't really his body made it easier to accept.  Most of the &quot;campers&quot; were middle aged people including saggy Aunt Helen.  There were some families, too but mostly with young children.  There were very few teenagers.  One of the few was a blond boy just a little bigger than Tony/Jack who combined a strikingly handsome face with a perpetually drowsy expression.  He never let Tony/Jack out of his sight.  Tony combed Jack's memories to try and figure out what to do but only dredged up frustration at a series of inappropriate touches.  Playing volleyball, the boy always managed to find an excuse for patting Tony's tight little rear.  At the swimming pool, he always followed Tony into the water or was there waiting for him.  <br />
<br />
But except for the blond boy with a crush on him, the degree to which the place was asexual amazed him.  But seeing everyone's penis or breasts or ass all the time took all the mystery and charge out of it.  Tony ran around playfully, naked every minute and not feeling sexual at all.<br />
<br />
Monday in school, Tony saw Jack, in Eric's body laughing at him as soon as he saw him.  &quot;So that's where you were going all those times you said your family was going to see Aunt Helen&quot;  Jack just kept laughing.<br />
<br />
For the coming week, while the others had some exceptional experiences in their new bodies, Tony mostly luxuriated in the love of the Sullivans.  They were so casually affectionate toward him, their son that the contrast to the St. Martins was immense.  &quot;Why can't mom and dad be like this?&quot; he wondered angrily.  &quot;It would be great for Mark, too&quot;<br />
<br />
When it came time to be chronivac'd back to their natural bodies on Thursday, Tony liked returning to being 6'1&quot; tall again.  He loved feeling his powerful buns swelling behind him and his immense penis swelling to its former size in front of him.  He loved gaining back the 7 pounds of muscle he'd lost.  He loved gaining back the striking face he'd picked for himself.  But he missed the love he'd gotten as Jack.</p>
