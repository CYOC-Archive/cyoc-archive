<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For several minutes after Ty woke up he simply lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling as he marveled in the power he now wielded. The memory of Dustin&#39;s late-night transformations was still fresh in his mind, and he found himself itching to try it again. Changing Dustin had been exciting enough, so why not try it on himself?<br />
<br />
Ty pushed himself up from his bed and went to the mirror, examining his shirtless reflection. He wasn&#39;t bad looking, if he said so himself, although he lacked Dustin&#39;s natural musculature. For a long time he&#39;d wondered what he&#39;d be like in the future, but now he had his chance to see for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to slowly age to 20,&quot; he said aloud, repeating the command he&#39;d used on Dustin the night before.<br />
<br />
For a moment nothing happened, until suddenly his body shot up three whole inches, the sudden increase in height nearly tipping him over. His skinny form hardened slightly as his shoulders expanded outwards and muscle grew beneath his pale skin--although nothing compared to what Dustin had, he was sad to say. His face widened as his jaw squared out, his brow deepening and adam&#39;s apple protruding further from his neck.<br />
<br />
At the same moment his wispy sideburns thickened, dirty blond hairs crawling down the edge of his jaw and rounding the edge of his chin as a mustache filled in above his lip. Hair likewise sprouted in a small patch between his nipples and one under his navel, though it grew no further. His faint armpit hair thickened, his pubes likewise growing thicker along with the hair on his thighs and calves.<br />
<br />
Ty was disappointed to see that his cock only grew by another inch or two, rounding off at an average but unimpressive five inches soft. He looked himself over in the mirror and confirmed his prior assessment; attractive, but nothing remarkable. He rubbed his jaw and huffed upon realizing that his facial hair was still patchy and underdeveloped, his mustache and beard not even connecting. For a moment he just glared at his reflection before realization struck him; if he was disappointed with his predicted growth, why not change it?<br />
<br />
This time he didn&#39;t bother to speak, instead concentrating as hard as he could on his desires. The first thing to change--as one might expect from a teenage boy--was his cock, which before his eyes began to fatten and length, the shaft slowly sliding further and further down his thigh until it rested just above his knee. A curious idea prompted his foreskin to regrow, and he shuddered at the arousing feeling of it. With one hand he hoisted his new dick upwards, grinning as he squeezed its impressive ten-inch length, its girth so wide his hand didn&#39;t even go all the way around. The fact that it looked obscene on his thin form was irrelevant, and Ty was in fact aroused by that difference.<br />
<br />
The next change was his size, as his body swelled and expanded until he stood at six and a half feet, even. A thought sent tingles racing through him as muscle piled onto the thin bones, forcing his shoulders apart as his body grew as cut and tones as a professional athlete&#39;s. He flexed one arm, grinning as his biceps and triceps swelled until their combined size equaled a football. He grasped his smooth meaty pecs, running his fingers through the valley between them and down his eight-pack abs, all the way to his now enormous thighs, between which hung his equally muscular meat.<br />
<br />
Ty glanced up, and frowned upon noticing how out-of-place his baby face looked on this hulking body. His brow tensed as he concentrated, and a moment later his smooth cheeks darkened as his beard stubble thickened and spread, filling in the patchy spaces and filling out to a full beard. He sent the hair racing down his neck and into his pecs, at which point it exploded outwards, covering the bulging hills in a forest of light brown hair reaching all the way from armpit to armpit. His abs vanished beneath the dark golden curls that soon cradled his enormous cock, spreading down his thighs and calves and across his feet and toes, so thick his skin nearly disappeared. The hair even grew across his shoulders, back, and ass, but Ty, too enraptured with it, didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned broadly, flexing his muscles and watching the hairy mounds swell with power. He still looked youthful, but the hair and muscle took away any of the immaturity he previously possessed. His reflection alone was enough to send blood flooding through his new cock, which began to grow even thicker and longer as it arched upwards, its head leaking as it lay against his fuzzy abs.<br />
<br />
Wrapping a hand around it, Ty grinned as another idea popped into his head...</p>
