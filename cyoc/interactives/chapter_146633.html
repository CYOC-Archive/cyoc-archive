<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before leaving the classroom with Melanie, you turn back to the twin teachers of wildly differing proportions and sizes. You approach Betty, whose head was touching the ceiling even while sitting on the floor. You looked her in the eye and held her gaze while concentrating. Slowly, you tilt your head downward without breaking eye contact with the giantess. From your viewpoint, Betty shrank down to less than a foot in height all together, which is when you broke contact. You reach down to carefully pick up the doll-sized Betty before turning toward Abby, saying, “You can go back to teaching, again, Ms. Barnes.” The woman with the mammoth mammaries nodded to you and, with some effort, returned to her desk as if nothing had changed. She naturally adapted to the extra mass taking up space between her and her work area, placing several items atop her breasts like a secondary desktop. You then accompanied Melanie with Betty on your shoulder as you both exited the classroom and into the corridor.<br />
<br />
It did not take long for you to reach your destination as you entered Melanie’s chemistry classroom. Unlike your last class, this featured numerous tables to allow two students to share. You saw Melanie sat behind her designated table and spotted the empty stool next to her, noting her missing partner. As you sat down you carefully placed Betty on the table in front of you. Before you could do anything else, you heard the bell sound as it signaled the beginning of class. You looked toward the front of the room to find a stout gentleman with a bald head and a chinstrap beard.<br />
<br />
Professor Phineas taught chemistry for nearly fifty years throughout various grade levels and schools, and this was to be his last year teaching. He began his lesson for the day, but you decide to apply your brand of teaching like before. You stood from your seat and walked over to Phineas, who was too busy writing out some chemical equation on the white board. You move right behind him and place your hand on top of his head and gently pressed down. Phineas’s form effortlessly and painlessly crumpled into a ball of paper the size of a melon as you pushed down toward the floor. You pick up the former teacher and begin to roll the paper wad in your hands until it morphed into a fresh, giant red apple. Holding the fruit in one hand, you turn your attention toward the students. “Now, class,” you address the room. “Who can tell me the four states of matter?”<br />
<br />
After a moment of silence, a tanned young woman with short hair and wide hips in the leftmost middle of the room raised her hand. You point to her, “Yes, Ms.…?”<br />
<br />
The student stood and spoke. “Claire. And the four states of matter are solid, liquid, gas and plasma.”<br />
“Thank you, Ms. Claire,” you say as you use your finger to carve out a piece of apple three inches in length. You reach out holding the piece of fruit in your hand, making it appear as if you are holding it directly over Claire’s head. As if instinctually, the young woman grasped it in her hands, instantly becoming enlarged to a foot long. She then sat at her table and started to take small bites from the slice in her hands. After consuming several bites, the young woman’s chest begins to grow beneath her blouse, her breasts increasing in size by the second until she is sporting a rack the size of her head. Her brunette partner with square glasses was showing signs of envy at this reward, of which you took note of before continuing.<br />
<br />
You look around the room and eyed a tall young man wearing a green letterman jacket. He appeared to be physically fit and broad with a head of short, brown hair. “You, there,” you called out to him. “What does the nucleus of an atom consist of?” The student pondered for a moment considering his answer before responding with, “Uh, protons and… electrons?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry, Mr.…?”<br />
<br />
“Daniel.”<br />
<br />
“Daniel, I’m sorry but you are only half correct,” you say to him as you walk up and stand next to the student. You place a hand on his shoulder and focus on his height. You hazard a guess that he stood tall at five-foot-ten whereas you are only five-foot-four. That changed as you transferred inches from the student into yourself, taking from him half of his height and adding it to your own. You found you needed to bend at the waist to continue contact with the young man as he dwindled into his clothes. You also notice your own musculature increased in volume while he is thinning ever so slightly. Leaving the student at two-foot-eleven, he appeared to be a small child wearing his older brother’s clothes. Meanwhile, your head brushes the ceiling of the room as you stand towering over everyone at eight-food-two. Your own clothes stretched taut against your body, appearing comically small and revealing. You knelt so as not to seem intimidating to the class, taking another bite from the now comparatively smaller apple with one hand. “Would anyone like to provide the correct half of that answer?”<br />
<br />
One hand shot up and you saw that it belonged to the brunette with glasses sitting next to Claire. You also see that Claire’s apple slice is halfway eaten and her breasts have grown significantly to the point they burst through the blouse and were now resting bare on the table before her. Each breast is now roughly the size of the student’s torso. “Yes,” you say as you motion toward the brunette. The petite young woman stood, and said, “Neutrons is the right answer.”<br />
<br />
“Well done, Ms.…?”<br />
<br />
“Lucille,” the young woman answered.<br />
<br />
“Right, Lucille,” you respond. You gesture for her to stand before you and she complies eagerly. She is wearing a simple top with a U-shaped neckline and baggy shorts that start from her waist. Even while kneeling, you are still a head taller than the five-foot-even brunette. You take a large bite from the apple and chew right before you lean in to press your lips to the young woman’s. Rather than resist, she accepted the embrace, allowing you to not only force-feed the apple to her, but allow physical contact to then transfer the inches you took from the young man.<br />
<br />
The intended affect was instantaneous as Lucille quickly rose in height where she stood while her modest mounds grew outward from her chest. You soon found yourself needing to stand on your own feet as the gap closed between you two. You then needed to arch your back as Lucille leaned over you to remain in contact, her form now towering above you. Height was not the only attribute being transferred as you noticed Lucille appeared broader. She now lifted you in her larger, stronger arms while your newfound physique returned to normal. You felt her now enormous breasts being pressed into your body as they seemed to have grown to the same size as Melonie’s. Deciding it was time to end this, you broke away from Lucille’s large lips. You see that her glasses now looked smaller on her head. She licked up the last bit of apple she could before setting you on the floor.<br />
<br />
Taking a step back, you look at the amazon before you, standing at an impressive seven-foot-eleven with firm breasts half the size of her torso. The undercurve of each breast is exposed while her top stretched to keep them covered, save for her areola showing. Her shorts became taut around each thick thigh, and her shoes tore apart while her socks were sliding down her feet. Lucille returned to her table but had to sit on the floor due to being too large for the chair. Meanwhile, Claire’s breasts finished their growth with a last bite of the apple slice, each fleshy orb of fat resembling the size of prized pumpkins. Both young women seemed eager to continue learning while also appearing unphased by these recent developments. At least in Claire’s case, whereas Lucille seems to be more concerned with simply being rewarded than enhancing herself. You can sense she simply has a competitive streak about her.<br />
<br />
You look back toward the shrunken young man and decided to give him a second chance. You approach Daniel, and say, “Tell you what, I’ll give another chance.”<br />
<br />
“If you can tell me what a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids is called,” you say to him, “as well as give an example of it, I may give you bonus points.” Daniel pondered for a moment, thinking carefully on how to answer. Some seconds later, the athlete let out a deep sigh and said, “I’m afraid I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“That’s too bad, Daniel.” You look to a young woman with lightly tanned skin and short brown hair sitting next to him, looking considerably taller than the athlete, now. “Perhaps you can, Ms.…?”<br />
<br />
“Maria, and I believe the answer you’re looking for is emulsion,” she answered knowingly. You slice off some apple and gave it to the student, who accepted and began to eat it. Her breasts immediately begin to grow, pushing apart the buttons on her blouse until they had grown to the size of her head.<br />
<br />
“And an example of emulsion would be,” you ask her.<br />
<br />
“Milk.”<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” you say as you give her another slice of apple. Maria ate this second piece which resulted in her breasts looking heavier than before while no larger. Two dark stains formed around her nipples and continued to spread outward, dampening her blouse. “You are going to tutor and care for Mr. Daniel from now on, Maria.”<br />
<br />
“Will do,” she said. Maria lifted the smaller young man from his seat and placed him on her lap. She pulled out one of her breasts and began to feed him as if he were a babe. The bell chimed to signal the end of the class period, which prompted everyone to begin packing up their belongings. You walk back to Melonie and gently pick Betty up in your other hand. Before leaving with Melanie, you decided to sample the apple for yourself.<br />
<br />
Taking one bite, breasts begin to grow from your chest until they reach just larger than your head. Your shirt stretched and tented outward allowing air to pass underneath the hem, their undercurve showing. The second bite resulted in dark stains forming around your nipples as you feel your breasts grow heavy with milk. The third bite causes you to grow in height once more, your clothes stretching tight to the point of tearing slightly. Your shirt slid up over your breasts exposing them to the open air before it tore off your torso completely. Standing taller than before at nine-foot-three, you look down past your breasts at Melanie and the now toy-sized Betty in your oversized hand. “So where to next,” you ask your classmate.</p>
