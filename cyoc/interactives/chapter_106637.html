<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Frieda Knight and Eric Anderson gathered at the student riders exit of Moon Lake High School waiting for Spencer Lawson and her grandfather Mike to arrive, they saw Brian Walker get on the bus for home with a very unhappy look on his face.<br />
Regardless of who that older blonde was that met him in front of the school in a red convertible the last couple of days, it obviously wasn&#39;t his aunt like the were-otter had told them. Whether or not Julie Stovall or somebody working on her behalf blabbed about Brian&#39;s luck with another woman was unknown, but obviously he didn&#39;t want to go home to face his mother.<br />
&quot;I looked it up in the library during my study period. While all the other laws like rape and incest still apply, especially if normal minors are involved; did you know that sex between an adult were and a were minor is actually legal in Moon Lake, but only if they&#39;re both active weres, meaning they&#39;ve already experienced their first transformation, and are willing participants?&quot; asked Frieda.<br />
&quot;First I&#39;ve heard about that, but obviously what the Sheriff meant when he said no laws were broken concerning Brian and whoever he was actually with,&quot; surmised Eric.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Would you do it? Have sex with an adult, that is.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know. It&#39;s still about 4 years until you and Spencer turn 18, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he replied with a smile.<br />
&quot;Good answer,&quot; said Frieda, as she began to kiss him.<br />
Just then, Spencer arrived. &quot;Couldn&#39;t wait and started without me, huh? I better make up for lost time fast,&quot; she said with a smile, before kissing both Eric and Frieda.<br />
But before they could decide what to do next, Mike Lawson arrived in his car to pick them up from school and take the trio to the Moon Lake Diner like Frieda requested earlier that morning.<br />
He never said a word about what Spencer and Eric&#39;s mothers were up to, and if any of the kids smelled a hint of it on him, they never said.<br />
<br />
AT THE DINER...<br />
The four of them walked in to see the place packed, which brought a smile to Frieda&#39;s face as a waitress approached.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;re closed for a private party right now,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;I know. I&#39;m Frieda Knight, the lady who made the arrangements for this,&quot; said Frieda, showing the waitress both her school ID and a platinum credit card. &quot;Whatever everyone&#39;s having, it&#39;s on me, including the three people with me now,&quot; she added, indicating Eric, Spencer, and her grandfather.<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Knight. I&#39;ll get everyone menus right away,&quot; promised the waitress, before hurrying off to do so.<br />
&quot;Just find a seat where you can and order whatever you&#39;d like. We shouldn&#39;t be here more than an hour or so, depending upon what everyone has to say,&quot; Frieda told her friends.<br />
As Eric and the Lawsons attempted to find an empty table, Frieda addressed the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELLO EVERYBODY!&quot; she shouted, as a smile formed on her face.<br />
Once she had their attention, &quot;I&#39;ve already instructed the waitress that whatever you want is on me. I&#39;m so very happy to see you all here. For those who haven&#39;t met the people who came in with me, these are my friends Eric and Spencer, as well as her grandfather Mike.&quot;<br />
A brief round of greetings were exchanged between Frieda&#39;s school friends and the entire household staff who recently departed the Knight estate over her father slugging Jeffery the butler. Then Frieda went around and personally said hello to everyone, but there was one noticeable absentee.<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Jeffery?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;He&#39;s out of the hospital and resting at his sister&#39;s apartment, but on the advice of his lawyer, sends his regards for not coming, despite how much he wanted to see you,&quot; explained John the chauffeur, who Frieda could not help noticing was sitting next to Ethel, the head cook. She always suspected there might be something between them, but any kind of a relationship between underlings was something they could not explore while in Benton Knight&#39;s employment.<br />
&quot;I understand. Wish him well for me when you see him next.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; promised John, &quot;and I did return the town car this morning, but there was no one home at the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, but that&#39;s of no consequence to me. Everyone&#39;s health and welfare are more important,&quot; Frieda said, before moving on to say hello to everyone else gathered in the diner.<br />
<br />
Once that was done, Frieda went back to a position where hopefully everyone could hear her clearly. &quot;Now then, a lot has happened since you left yesterday,&quot; she began, before filling everyone in.<br />
Frieda told them about her father&#39;s actions at Tachibana Enterprises, being removed from the were-council and the other sanctions he now faced as a consequence of his actions.<br />
&quot;I have no idea who will take his place between now and the time I can legally assume the position*,&quot; admitted Frieda. &quot;However, because I am to eventually do so, father can no longer even threaten to send me out of Moon Lake for any reason, let alone actually enroll me in some stuck up <i>finishing</i> school out of the country.&quot;<br />
That announcement was met by a round of applause from all the diner&#39;s customers as Frieda blushed.<br />
<br />
When the applause died down, Frieda wiped a tear from her eye before continuing. &quot;Now then, to say I&#39;ve missed you all is a serious understatement. If he hasn&#39;t already begun doing so, father soon plans to attempt renegotiating your return to your former positions. I am not here to attempt to talk you into returning, despite how much I would dearly love that. However, I am here to find out what, besides the obvious, needs to change in the Knight household, as well as personally guarantee everyone to write my own letter of reference for you should you decide to seek greener pastures elsewhere. Also, if I ever get a place of my own, while it will be nowhere near as large as my parents&#39; estate, should I ever need help, the jobs are yours.&quot;<br />
That received another, but briefer round of applause than her previous statement.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be sitting with my other friends over there,&quot; added Frieda, looking around to see where Eric and the Lawsons finally managed to secure a table. &quot;Enjoy your meals, and please stop by to let me know your opinions and forwarding addresses if you&#39;ll need those letters I promised. Otherwise, it was truly great to see you all again,&quot; she said, taking a quick bow before going to join the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t help noticing that Frieda kept referring to him as &#39;father&#39; and not &#39;dad&#39;,&quot; pointed out Mike Lawson, as Frieda began working her way back to them.<br />
&quot;A very long story that I&#39;ll have to tell you about sometime grandpa,&quot; promised Spencer, as Frieda joined them. She took a notebook and pen out of her purse before sitting down at the table to join them in a late afternoon snack, waiting to find out the opinions and comments of those formerly under her parents&#39; employ.<br />
