<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Need help?&quot; Sam asked as he stepped out of the bedroom, still trying to tug the tank top down. Oddly, he would have sworn it fit the other day, but today it seemed to be riding up on him. At least it still went down over the waistband of his shorts, even if the neck exposed some of his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch out, don&#39;t step in the kitchen, floor is still drying.&quot; Hank said from where he stood by the couch, most of the furniture stacked up to one side of the apartment, though the couch was only a little shifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right..&quot; Sam moved away from the kitchen where he could see the wood floor slightly damp and glistening. &quot;Too heavy?&quot; He asked as he moved to the other end of the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could have done it.&quot; Hank admitted. &quot;But I&#39;d figure I&#39;d rescue you from Gio. He sees some muscles and a big bulge in the shorts and he pounces. Wolves have no shame, or subtlety.&quot; The skunk said with a smile, grabbing the other side of the couch and moving it with Sam to the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta say, these floors are in pretty good condition, either you take care or you just moved in. Claws are one thing, but hooves are murder on most wood.&quot; Hank commented as they set the couch back down. Sam lost his balance for a moment, having to catch himself on the arm of the couch. &quot;You okay?&quot; Hank asked, sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just didn&#39;t get enough sleep.&quot; Sam flexed his suddenly numb feet, lifting one than the other to shake it, trying to return feeling to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.. road construction?&quot; Hank asked as he moved over to grab his equipment, dipping the roller brush into a tray of some clear liquid that he started to spread on the exposed floor. He stopped to nod over to where Sam&#39;s work boots were propped by the door. &quot;I used to do road work myself, the tar on the boots are a give away. Glad I can get away bootless on this job. Boots for our feet suck, don&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Sam said slowly as he looked over at the boots. They looked off, but why should they, he had had these boots for months now. Well, anthro boots always looked a little off, the bends to accommodate the right shape, and the extra grip at the bottom completely covering the foot. Sam&#39;s legs finally felt sturdy enough to hold him again and he set his hooves back down on the floor, the rubber protection shoes he wore on them making the soft squeak they always did.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be glad to toss those, bud.&quot; Hank said with a grin, nodding to Sam&#39;s hoof caps. &quot;Got these floors myself last week. It&#39;s been great, the smell fades in a day, just leave a window or two open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam gave a slow nod as he plopped down on the couch, watching Hank work. The skunk was lean, though surprisingly tall, his tail twitching slightly behind him as he kept the conversation going, though Sam found it hard to concentrate. It felt like a headache coming on, but there was no pain, just a pressure in his skull. It was probably that acrid chemical smell. He leaned over and opened one of the apartment windows, letting in some fresh air.<br />
<br />
&quot;...you can mop it like normal. Just don&#39;t use any bleach. Get a recoat down every five years or if it seems to be wearing off.. you okay?&quot; Sam looked over to Hank, the words filtering into his cotton stuffed brain a few minutes late. The skunk was already moving to the counter, most of the apartment other than where Sam sat and the bedroom now coated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry, must of dazed out.&quot; Sam smacked his lips a few times, his tongue and teeth feeling too large for his face. He rubbed his too broad nose with his hand, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sit and relax, I&#39;ll get Gio to help me with the bedroom floor.&quot; Hank gave him a sideways look and disappeared into the bedroom. Sam nodded and flopped sideways on the couch, his head on one arm rest, hooves hanging over the other end.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The wolf was finishing mounting the fur dryer on the wall as Hank popped his head into the bathroom. &quot;Damn, man, it&#39;s really doing a number on this one. Sometimes it&#39;s almost like he knows something is wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gio looked over to his partner and shrugged. &quot;You know some humans resist more than others. Either way..&quot; The wolf let out a soft low whistle. &quot;He is gonna be some stud, isn&#39;t he? Knew the moment I saw him in the parking lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did pick it. Are you trying to make yourself a boyfriend?&quot; The skunk asked with a sigh, just making Gio give an unabashed grin and a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are worse ways to find a date.&quot; Gio stood and walked to the bedroom door, peeking out to where the partially transformed Sam lay on the couch, one hand idly stroking over the bulge in his shorts. &quot;Besides, I think he&#39;s enjoying himself.&quot; He whispered, his yellow eyes fixated on the sight. &quot;C&#39;mon, pull it out. I wanna see it.&quot; He muttered to himself, but got a slap on the shoulder from Hank. &quot;What? Like you&#39;re not curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Hank said, going to move the bedroom furniture out of the way so he could get to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told him he should come work with us.&quot; Gio stated as he wandered over to help with the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Dude, he does that and he&#39;ll probably figure out what happened. Besides, you know all the former humans on the crew asked to be changed. Not, you know.&quot; Hank made a motion to the other room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he won&#39;t care.&quot; Gio said with a touch of hope in his voice, looking over to meet Hank&#39;s flat stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, gonna lift your tail, wiggle your hole at him, and hope your bottom game is good enough to make him not worry about it?&quot; Hank forestalled any more comment from Gio with a raised paw. The wolf may have been the bigger of the two, but crew wise, Hank had seniority. &quot;Go install the fur filters in the vents. And try not to slip and fall on any horse dick while you&#39;re at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounded like a chastisement from the skunk, but Gio knew him well enough to not be too bothered by it. His friend meant well and maybe he was getting a little carried away. Any worries about that fled as he stepped into the living room and saw exactly what he had been hoping to see. Sam&#39;s shorts were down, a long, thick cock sticking out over his stomach, the beginning of a sheath forming around the base, the skin turning a mottled pattern of pink and black. Sam though was still asleep, arm over his eyes above the beginnings of an equine muzzle. The wolf had to take a moment to adjust his own pants with a soft whimper before going to fetch the filters.</p>
