<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before we start I want to change 3 things <br />
1. Zach is 16 years old in this story <br />
2. Zack has 1 younger sibling who is currently at his Aunts 3 year old Jeffery and he knows about the  families powers. And he isn’t fully potty trained and can’t read. but is kinda in on the families sexual thing but he hasn’t participated yet.<br />
3. Zack plays more than 1 sport he plays Soccer, Basketball, track and field even some football. <br />
Lets start the chapter <br />
<br />
Maddie walks over to Jeffery, putting hers or Zack’s arms around his neck. Jeffery asks, “Are you sure about this?” Zack, trapped inside his body, is happy to hear his dad was against this. &quot;Well, it’s probably the best way to get him to understand and accept our family. Zack’s has been against our powers for years now. I tried to ease him in, but he just won’t accept it.” Maddie says, looking sad for a second. &quot;Plus, this is a perfect punishment for him.” <br />
<br />
Jeffery eagerly says okay, leaning forward and kissing his wife, who is currently in Zack’s body. Maddie immediately started kissing back; after maybe 10 seconds, she felt her husband try to push his tongue into her new mouth. She blushes but opens her mouth, French kissing her husband while in her son’s body. Jeffery then raps his arms around her back and pulls her closer. In response, she keeps kissing, falling further into the kiss, closing her eyes, and on instinct, lifting up her leg in a feminine manner. <br />
<br />
Mean while Trapped inside his own mind Zack was disgusted at this; he was being forced to watch his parents play with his body, and even worse, his mom wanted to have sex with his dad while still in his body. But most of all, Zack was embarrassed. He was used to his family’s powers, but he hated that they used them so normally, sometimes even without permission in his little sister&#39;s case. He didn’t hate his family; he loved them, but the powers made them all act weird sometimes, from his Mollie possessing his dad and jerking off naked on the couch to what his mom and dad were doing right now with his body. <br />
<br />
Jeffery then caught Maddie off guard by grabbing her butt during the kiss, making Maddie let out a small moan that escaped her male mouth. She blushes, lightly smacking him on the shoulder. “You did that on purpose, you jerk.” Jeffery looks down at her, laughing, saying, “Sorry, I really couldn’t help myself. He takes after you. Ya’know his butt is way too big; it’s already big than mine.” Maddie says, “That’s because of his workouts and his sports. I mean, Zack does play soccer in the summer, basketball in the winter, and track and field in the spring. although he did say people were asking him to play football.”<br />
<br />
 Jeffery’s says, “No, honey, that’s all you. I’ve felt your butt before; it’s thicker than muscular. Zack’s butt matches that perfectly; I’ve heard it when we go to his games. He has a bubble butt like yours, not a muscle butt like mine.” Maddie than slowly looks behind herself, looking at her’s or Zack&#39;s, butt and blushes, saying, “I guess you&#39;re right, I never really noticed.” Jeffery then grabs her legs and picks her up. Maddie letting out A girlish squeak that didn’t sound right came from Zack’s male teenage body and instinctively rapped her legs around Jeffery’s waist. <br />
<br />
Zack was so embarrassed by that noise; he sounded so weird and girly. “Did I surprise you?” Jeffery says, laughing at Maddie. Maddie looks mad, saying, “You should have at least warned me. That caught me by surprise.” Jeffery says, Well, let’s pick where we left off, kissing her again and carrying her over to the couch. Maddie grabs his face and starts kissing him back. He lays her down on the couch, unbuttoning her pants and pulling her pants down. <br />
<br />
Zack, trapped and forced to watch, begins to beg, saying please stop, please stop, please something, let them stop. It felt like torture to watch his own dad slowly peel off his body&#39;s clothes while home wasn’t in control and he couldn’t do anything but watch. It sounded like some old horror move or weird porn plot, but he was really experiencing it right now. He stops seeing his son’s bulge in his underwear. Maddie asked, “Why did you stop?” disappointed that he stopped removing Zack’s clothes. Jeffery says, “Zack is a little bigger than I remember his.” Maddie responds, &quot;Yeah, last time he was about 5 inches; he was 15 then I don’t know about now.” Jeffery starts to remove Zack’s body underwear, saying, Well, let’s see. He finally removes them, letting Zack penis free, and it was a surprise. Zack has grown quite a bit in just a year; he was now at least 6 or maybe 7 inches long and had gotten thicker. Yeah, he wasn’t as thick as his dad or as long, but compared to anyone else, he was huge in comparison. <br />
<br />
Shocking both parents into silence. Jeffery is the first to say something, “Well, he&#39;s a lot bigger than I remember.” Maddie continues his thought, saying, “And thicker he’s grown A-lot in just 1 year, and I don’t think I’m fully hard.” Jeffery just looks at her in surprise, saying, “You have got to be kidding me; he’s not going to be bigger than me when he grows up, maybe even by the time he turns 18.” Zack was so embarrassed he had grown and was proud of it, but hearing other people, especially his parents, talk about it was just weird to him, but part of him couldn’t help but admit he was kind of happy to hear them be so proud of him and his body, or dick in this instance. <br />
<br />
Jeffery leans down slowly, licking Zack’s dick from his balls all the way up to the tip of the head, making Maddie moan loudly. She didn’t have to be quiet. Mollie was asleep, and everyone knew Mollie was a heavy sleeper. Jeffery’s does it again and again, stopping to ask Maddie, “Does that feel good? Do you like that, honey?” Maddie was so confused and horny just responded, “Yes, yes, please keep going, please keep going.” Maddie and Jeffery had done plenty of gay sex, but for some reason it felt different. There weren’t many men hung like Zack, let alone like Jeffery, and they tended to go for men near his age, but Zack, while he wasn’t a virgin, was still kind of sensitive. Jeffery stopped licking her A-top at least half of her or Zack’s dickey in his mouth. Zack’s body was super sensitive, so it made Maddie react instantly. She started to sweet and moan loudly, grabbing the arms of the crouch and curling her toes.<br />
<br />
 Jeffery continued putting even more of Maddie’s new dick into his mouth but stopped at 5 inches; that was all his mouth could take, unfortunately, so he started giving her an A blowjob that sent Zack’s body into overdrive. Maddie was on cloud 9; it felt amazing, far different from anything she had ever felt before. After nearly 15 minutes, Maddie finally screamed “I’m cumming,” ejaculating straight into Jeffery&#39;s mouth after about 5 shots of cum. His mouth was full, and he then pulled her dick out of his mouth. Maddie was still shooting eight more shots onto his face, and after a full minute of her cumming, she finally stopped. Jeffery swallows the cum in his mouth and says, “That boy cums more than me, and I cum like a porn star, but he cums like a damn horse.” Maddie barely heard any of it; she was still coming down from her ejaculation high or whatever you wanted; to call it as for Zack. He was downright embarrassed from everything they did; he knew he came more than normal people, but he didn’t cum like a horse, like his dad said. He did want to admit it, but part of his was horny from seeing that. Maybe he was just as weird as the rest of his family. Just as Zack thought that he saw a weird light in his head that was shining, lighting up everything, he slowly walked towards the light and found A small orb hesitantly touched the orb and then grabbed it he holds it staring at it amazed . Zack then pushed it towards his chest, absorbing it into himself.</p>
