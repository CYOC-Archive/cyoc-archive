<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heart pounding, you flip open to page two: stone statues. <br />
<br />
This is a section divided into different types of stones. Marble, soapstone, alabaster, onyx, basalt. <br />
<br />
Each section for stone, has sub sections. One for male, one for female. And each gender subsection, has sub-sub sections for styles, such as Greek, Roman, African, Classical. And each of those sections has sub-sub-sub sections for age ranges. <br />
<br />
This is quite a book, with a lot to go over. Each page is filled with so much information, with thumbnail-sized images as examples for the various options. <br />
<br />
You like the gray marble statues. But while you were browsing, a loud young boy was carrying on down the aisle. He was maybe 11 of 12 years old. Blond hair. Steel-blue eyes. Thick lips. A good looking boy. You chuckle at his antics, as you focus back on the book before you. <br />
<br />
You decided to go with a gray, marble male statue. It&#39;s harder than soapstone, so much less likely chance you would break. That thought turned you on. <br />
<br />
You went to the desk, and gave the clerk the specifics of your wishes. He invited you into the back, where you saw the rowdy kid from before. But this time, he was naked and his skin was turning gray. He was crying, saying he didn&#39;t want to be a statue!<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! I just wanna go home!&quot;<br />
<br />
His lower body was hardening into the same gray marble you had chosen! His small, undeveloped penis in the beginning stages of puberty was extending. Becoming erect, but it was frozen solid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! I have to go to the bathroom! Please! I just wanna go home! I didn&#39;t mean it!&quot;<br />
<br />
He suddenly stood up right. His entire short skinny 5 foot frame. There was a slight rocky rumbling as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puh- puh- puh-&quot; <br />
<br />
His little stomach was struggling to push in and out, as his abdomen slowly hardened. He then fell silent, as his lungs were no longer functional. The boy seemed to notice this. His steel-blue eyes got wide, and he was working his mouth frantically. A final moan escaped his thick lips, as the last of his air pushed over his still-flesh vocal chords. <br />
<br />
His chest began to harden. He looked down at his hard, yet smooth, gray marbled body in disbelief. He was using his hands to feel his stony chest. He grabbed his own literal rock-hard penis with his left hand. It wasn&#39;t twitching even in the slightest.<br />
<br />
His head was lifted up with the same rocky grinding noise as his body had a bit ago, only less noisy. <br />
<br />
While you were standing off to the side watching this entire thing play out, there was a mirror positioned in front of him, so he could look at his own statuefying progress. <br />
<br />
The gray marble began spreading up his neck, locking it in place. At the same time, it began to flow over his shoulders. One hand still trying to desparately hang onto his pubertifying marbled erected penis. His eyes wide with fear and shock. But as the marble spread over his shoulders, the same rocky grinding noise could be heard, as his arms were forced away from hiding his junk. Now, his face was turning red with embarrassment, right along with his fear and anxiety. <br />
<br />
At this point, his fear-filled eyes darted towards you. His eyes so full of expression, begging for mercy. Begging you to help him. But you just stood there, transfixed as if watching a trainwreck. His mouth was still working up and down. Trying to speak. But the marble stone continued on, inexorably. It ran up to his jaw line, putting all end to his mouth movement, but for one last move. His jaw closed shut, as did his lips. Locking both in place for good. His lips moved subtly and settled into an expressionless neutral position. No doubt, masking his fear and anxiety forever. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the marble had creeped down his short, thin upper arms. Encasing his little biceps. His fingers that were balled up in a fist through sheer anxiety, relaxed as they twitched one final time. Both of his arms now just casually hanging at his sides. Even though they were still flesh, the boy could no longer flex his hands or fingers. It was obvious he was trying. His eye balls, the only movement left to him, were darting around frantically as the rest of his body was permantly locked in place, and made to be on display. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on! Stop!&quot; You said. &quot;The boy obviously didn&#39;t ask for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, sir?&quot; asked the clerk who escorted you back here as all this was going on to some poor innocent young child. The boy&#39;s eyes looked over out of desparation and a spark of hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;That kid. He obviously doesn&#39;t want to be a statue. Why are you doing that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Because he was carrying on and broke a valuable item. He wasn&#39;t able to pay for it, so I brought him back here to replace it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much was it?&quot; <br />
<br />
The clerk told him the price, but said &quot;it&#39;s too late. It is irreversible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if- what if we switched places?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; asked the clerk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean. That boy. And myself. What if we switched bodies? Would that be possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean. I don&#39;t see why not. If you&#39;re able to pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, the statuefying process on the boy momentarily stopped. You and the clerk went back to the front desk to complete the transaction, leaving the boy standing back there, mostly encased in stone. <br />
<br />
You come back, and his eyes were full of wet tears. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want an introduction to what your getting yourself into, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk led you over to the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on. Check him over. That will be the body you&#39;ll inherit. Youthful age. Stone body, and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
You began exploring and feeling all around the marbled body of the boy that you will soon become. The small, smooth, rock-hard gray chest. The perfectly formed erect little penis. The little butt. Even the lips, and the still-flesh hands. <br />
<br />
God. To be stuck as a statue of a boy. Especially one you&#39;ve never met before, and would never recognize. For that face to be yours. His hair. Those small, shapely little ears. It turned you on mightily. At the same time, you wanted to back down. To be a statue? But the clerk had other ideas. <br />
<br />
He pushed you into a chair mostly facing the boy. The mirror to your right. Latches went over your wrists and ankles. He brought down a domelike device, and attached it to your head. He brought one over to the boy, and attached it to his head. Then he on flipped the device. <br />
<br />
One moment, you were sitting in the chair looking directly at the mostly statuefied boy in front of you while sitting next to the mirror facing the boy. The next moment, your standing stock still, looking at yourself sitting in that same chair out of the corner of your eyes! <br />
<br />
The clerk came over and took the dome instrument off your head. He was suddenly taller than you. Much taller! Like. Foot taller!<br />
<br />
You see movement from that chair, as you see yourself spring up out of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Omg, omg, omg!&quot; &quot;He&quot; said, as he was feeling all over his (your) body.<br />
<br />
He then looked over and down at you with a frightened look on his face, as if he&#39;s seen a ghost. <br />
<br />
You look straight ahead, and see the mirror. The image of that statuefying blond boy was now perfectly eyelevel with you, and you were looking directly into his steel-blue eyes. A big tear was stuck in the corner of your left eye. You swear you tried lifting your arm to clear it away, but your arm didn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
You attempt to say something, but your lips and your jaw are totally and completely locked in place! Not even a moan will ever escape from you now. <br />
<br />
You start to feel tingling in your forearms and on your cheeks. Your eyes go wide, as you realize the statuefying has begun, in order to complete the process of turning you totally into marble. Will you lose consciousness, and just simply leave a statue behind? Or will you be forced to stand and stare at one location, never to move a single inch? You guess you&#39;ll find out soon enough. You guess it&#39;ll be the latter, as your obviously not breathing. You don&#39;t even need to breath, you find with fascination.<br />
<br />
The boy that now occupies your body is practically hyperventilating, as he looks over his new body. The body you gave up for this. You begin to wonder why you wanted this in the first place. You&#39;re now going to be stuck as a statue of some young boy! Not even 5 feet tall! All your hard earned muscles. Gone.<br />
<br />
The marble creeps along up your cheeks, locking them in place in a neutral placid state. Your arms at your sides, and your long skinny fingers casually curled in. You can only move your eyeballs and your eyebrows. For the find being. But that will shortly change.<br />
<br />
Your tears are beginning to dry up, and your vision is clearing. You just stand there, looking at your new still-blond hair. And your still-blue eyes. Not used to the fact that hair and those eyes are now yours. You want to comb your fingers through your new, soft blond hair, but of course, your don&#39;t body doesn&#39;t respond. At all. Not even a tiny little bit. <br />
<br />
You feel the cold, electric tingly feeling go up the back of your neck, over your new little boy&#39;s ears, and begin it&#39;s journey towards your temples. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the boy in your body begins to calm down. He says something. He says: &quot;at least I don&#39;t need to pee now,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
 Your eyes go wide again. Pee! You just now noticed that you have the feeling for the need to pee! You also notice that your rock-hard small little youthful penis is erect! You need to urinate, and you need to get rid of this erection! But your stone piping seems to be clogged. You concentrate on trying to release your bladder, but that organ gas long since turned to stone!<br />
<br />
The marble finishes with your small little fingertips. It climbs up over the crown of your head. You desparately to say that you need to pee! You try to at least moan. Anything! You can&#39;t even so much as grimace! Your stoney mask of a face, forever betraying your internal thoughts and turmoil. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why? Why would I have wanted this!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, man. But apparently, that little guy didn&#39;t bother using the toilet before leaving his house. And he was in the beginning stages of &quot;discovering&quot; himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m OLD now!?&quot; You hear your voice say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 36! That&#39;s not old!&quot; But you remain physically silent. Not a single peep leaves your thick boyish lips. <br />
<br />
The marble creeps over your forehead. &quot;Uh oh! This is it!&quot; You think. &quot;The last outward sign of me ever being anything other than an object is about to be erased from this world for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is my favorite part! When the lights from their eyes are extinguished forever! It&#39;s always a mystery to me, if they lose consciousness, die, or what happens to them internally. Ah well. Guess I&#39;ll never find out. I&#39;m not crazy or stupid enough to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the marble covers your eyebrows, they settle into their final resting place. Never to be moved. Never to express any emotion. Just a simply neutral position. <br />
<br />
You and yo the right of your eyes, trying to look at your real face, but your body is too tall. And you are completely unable to tilt your head at all!<br />
<br />
The clerk walks over next to the mirror, and squats down to your new sub-5-foot height. He looks directly at your eyes. You try to maintain eye contact, but they seem to shift upon their own accord towards the mirror. Your eyes are now stuck, staring straight ahead! You find you can&#39;t even blink! <br />
<br />
The marble seems to be creeping faster on your left eyeball. You can do nothing but state helplessly, as your left eye slowly looses it&#39;s bright blue luster, as slowly goes gray. Soon enough, your iris completely disappears. Your entire left eye is just a solid flat gray color. <br />
<br />
The only thing left of you, is your right eye. Strangely, you can still see out of your left eye just fine. Just as you can still feel the need to pee and to jack off!<br />
<br />
You want to cry out, but you just stand there, motionless. Expressionless. <br />
<br />
.&quot;if you want out now, now&#39;s the time to say so.&quot; Says the clerk. &quot;Sorry I lied. It wasn&#39;t too late to reverse the process once it has begun. But once it&#39;s ended, that truly is it. You&#39;ll be stuck as a statue. Forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your attempt to speak, only ended in complete stony silence. The blue spark of your right eye shines for one glorious moment with a large tear forming. And it slowly fades into oblivion, as the flat, neutral gray color washes over it. The final lonely tear you shed, slowly makes its way down your stoney, expressionless, immobile right cheek. That tear is partially slowly absorbed into the stone, and partially evaporated away.</p>
