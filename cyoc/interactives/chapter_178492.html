<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lance found a tall tree and thought it was a good place to hide for a while. He wasn&#39;t a very athletic boy but he was in good enough shape to climb trees and run several miles without getting too tired. He wasn&#39;t too tall and he could be considered a late bloomer but the best thing about him was his mind, he was the smartest kid in his school and a big fan of strategy games.<br />
<br />
As he climbed the tree he saw several himbos approaching him and trying to pull him down. He was lucky because he managed to avoid their rocks and sticks but he wasn&#39;t lucky enough because when he was in the top, he felt too big hands grabbing him from behind and throwing him to the ground.<br />
<br />
It was a big burly guy dressed only with disturbingly tight SpongeBob briefs who got unconscious after falling on the ground too. Lance had landed on him but he wasn&#39;t happy because he was now surrounded. The himbos around him violently pulled his pants down, them his shirt, shoes, socks and finally his Fornite boxers.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately he started to feel something going on with his boyhood, he managed to look down at it only to see pubic hair violently coming out from his former hairless crotch. He began to moan when these hair started to come out in his scrotum as it grows into a very large sack, this moan then became a grunt as something started to happen to his small testicles.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt a very large pressure as his marbles began to push and a grapefruit sized testicle dropped in his loose sack then he felt the push again and the other one went in. As the changes went on he felt like he was starting to enjoy it despite he definitely didn&#39;t want to feel that way, the changes were already affecting his mind. Suddenly his small penis began to throb and grow in size as it went from boyhood to manhood, it was a very arousing experience so Lance was also getting an erection while his cock grew to a two feet long pole.<br />
<br />
He desperately tried to control his urges but he wasn&#39;t strong enough so he grabbed onto his veiny dick and began to jack off, this caused the changes to be faster. As he jacked off his shoulders broadened and his legs thickened giving him a very manly shape, next his small nipples began to swell and become more sensitive. He began to grow taller and more muscle was added to him, he looked like those stereotypical beach bodybuilders. He was over 7 feet tall as his cock and balls grew with him making each ball the size of a grapefruit and his massive cock 2.5 feet long, leaking precum like an open hose. The final changes came in as his face became less boyish as his baby fat melted and his jaw became more angular, finally the hair on his head shortened to his scalp as he began to grow thick hair all over his body. His chest was hidden under a dense forest of hair as it trailed over his bellybutton to a very thick and large amount of pubes around his dick and on his crotch, hair kept growing over his massive balls, around his asshole and over his ass and down his legs. His arms got super hairy as his face grew stubble, which led to a full beard reaching to his chest and a neatly trimmed mustache. The transformation ended with a large man laying on the ground shooting spunk out of his cock to a bunch of naked men lustfully staying at him.</p>
