<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bandit Keith hadn’t forgotten how Jason had humiliated him at the card game tournament. He held a grudge against Jason, and he was out to seek his revenge on the unsuspecting teenager.<br />
<br />
One day, during the last week of class, Jason was walking out the schoolyard, when he saw Keith walking in. Keith was obviously looking for someone to pick on, since he was bigger than everybody else.<br />
<br />
“You!” Keith shouted, the moment he spotted Jason. “I remember you from the tournament. Boy, I’m gonna have some fun with you now!”<br />
<br />
“Listen, dude” Jason shouted at him. “I beat you fair and square! So, leave me alone! If you’re a sore loser, than you just need to bear down and get over it!”<br />
<br />
Keith’s face turned red with rage, and he started to run towards Jason, who was several inches shorter than him. <br />
<br />
Jason turned around and started to runaway from him. As he dashed through the hallway, he noticed that Keith was slowly gaining up on him. Keith was obviously bigger and stronger, so he knew that it wouldn’t be long, or Keith would have caught up to him.<br />
<br />
Jason saw the door to the storage room, immediately after having turned the corner. He quickly opened the door, and slipped inside of the room, shutting the door behind him.<br />
<br />
When Keith turned around the corner, he didn’t see anybody.<br />
<br />
“Jason! Where are you? You can run but you can’t hide from me forever!” he warned, as he ran the other way.<br />
<br />
When Jason heard Keith’s footsteps as they faded away, he quietly opened the door and walked through the hallway on his toes.<br />
<br />
Jason ran towards the other end of the hallway, when he suddenly hit a dead end!<br />
<br />
“Rats! I gotta turn around…” he said to himself. <br />
<br />
As soon as he turned around, he found himself staring at Bandit Keith.<br />
<br />
“You think you can make fun of me at a stupid card tournament?” Keith said to him, as he continued to move closer. Jason was standing with his back against a brick wall, and there was no place to go.<br />
<br />
“You really think you’ll get away from that?” Keith said, as he grabbed Jason by the collar. “I’m going to teach you a lesson you’ll never forget!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jason heard footsteps from another person approaching them.<br />
<br />
“Leave him alone, Keith!” Ty ordered him.<br />
<br />
“Ty! Thank goodness you’re here!” Jason said. He had a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna make pork chops out of Jason… and Ty can watch!” Keith grinned.<br />
<br />
Keith grabbed Jason’s shirt collar with both hands, before slamming him with his back against the brick wall.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Keith was having a hard time manhandling Jason. Jason appeared to be growing bigger while Keith was shrinking!<br />
<br />
Within moments, they were both the same height, and Keith had to let go of him because he had become too big!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Keith shrank down further, until he was about 5 ft 6 inches. He was as tall as Jason used to be. In the meantime, Jason had grown to 6 ft 3 inches tall and was now as tall as Keith was, just moments before!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What is going on here? I’m short!” Keith exclaimed, as he looked down and noticed the changes in his body.<br />
<br />
Not only had their height been swapped, but Jason began to notice his body growing bigger as Keith’s was shrinking. Jason was gaining his muscle as well. Soon Keith was Jason’s original size, and Jason was Keith’s original size. <br />
<br />
Jason watched as Keith’s blonde hair began to shrink back into his head, and turn more of a brownish color. He could feel his hair lengthen and brush his ears and face. He looked over in a window along the hallway and saw that it was turning a bright blonde color, just like Keith’s. He also watched as his face began to restructure itself, becoming a bit more chiseled. His face itched and he watched as a bit of stubble grew on his chin and cheeks. Jason then realized that him and Keith were swapping again, only this time it would be more permanent. <br />
<br />
He looked back at Keith, who was looking more and more like Jason used to. In fact his eyes had turned the same brown color and Jason blinked knowing that his eyes had just turned bright blue. Keith’s shirt began to pale and turn a light grey color as the vest he was wearing simply disappeared. His boots shrank down, becoming a pair of sneakers as his tan pants shrunk up into a pair of shorts as they turned grey as well. The necklace and chain around his neck disappeared as well, as did his sunglasses and the bandanna tied around his head. The metal wristbands that Keith once wore were gone now, leaving Keith in Jason’s old body.<br />
<br />
Jason watched as his clothes too began to change as well. His shirt turning red as it thickened and gained a second layer, which changed into the vest Keith had worn. His shorts lengthened as they turned lighter to a tan color. His sneakers turned a dark brown and grew up around his calves coming to just below his knees. He felt a weight around his neck and he looked down to see the same necklace and chain hanging off his neck. Something tightly wrapped around his head, and he knew it was the bandanna. Sunglasses fell onto his nose, as he felt the wristbands snap around his wrists. Jason was now in Keith’s body <br />
<br />
“So, little Keith… what were you going to do to me?” Jason chuckled, as he walked closer to him. Jason was standing taller than Keith, by almost a foot!<br />
<br />
“Uhh nothing…. I gotta go!” Keith stuttered, as he turned around and started to run away. He quickly shoved Ty out of the way, before making his way to the parking lot outside.<br />
<br />
Both Ty and Jason laughed, as they watched Keith make the quick dash for the exit.<br />
<br />
“That’ll teach him!” Ty grinned. “So, what are you going to do, now that you’ve got his body?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I’ll think of something…” Jason replied.<br />
<br />
Jason and Ty walked towards the front door of the main building, wondering what new adventures would be waiting for them next…</p>
