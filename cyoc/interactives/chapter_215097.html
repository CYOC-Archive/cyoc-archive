<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Isaiah held the magic coin tightly in his hand, he closed his eyes and made his wish. He could feel a strange energy coursing through his body, and for a moment, he was afraid. But then he felt a sudden surge of strength, and he knew that his wish was coming true.<br />
<br />
Isaiah opened his eyes and looked down at his arms. He could see the muscles bulging beneath his skin, growing larger with each passing second. He flexed his bicep, feeling the hard muscle beneath his skin. He could feel the power coursing through his veins.<br />
<br />
Isaiah knew that he was growing taller too, and he looked down to see that his feet had burst through the bottom of his shoes. He could feel his bones stretching and growing, and he knew that he was becoming the man of the house.<br />
<br />
As Isaiah continued to grow, he could feel his muscles bulging out in every direction. His chest grew wider, his shoulders broader, and his abs became more defined with each passing moment. He felt like he was getting stronger and more powerful by the second.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his dad Eric was shrinking rapidly. Isaiah could see his father&#39;s muscles melting away as he transformed into a boy. Eric&#39;s once towering height dwindled to that of a small child, and his once chiseled physique became soft and weak.<br />
<br />
Isaiah couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of satisfaction as he looked down at his dad, now smaller and weaker than him. He had always looked up to his father and admired his strength, but now he was the one in charge. He was the man of the house now.<br />
<br />
As Isaiah flexed his newly grown muscles, he knew that he had truly become the man he had always wanted to be. He was taller and stronger than anyone else in the room, and he could feel the power surging through his body.<br />
<br />
With a smirk, he looked down at his dad, who was now barely reaching his waist. &quot;Looks like I&#39;m the man of the house now, Dad,&quot; he said, his voice deep and powerful.<br />
<br />
Eric looked up at his son in shock, unable to believe the transformation that had just taken place. But he knew that he could never compete with Isaiah&#39;s newfound strength and power. He would have to accept that his son was now the true man of the house.<br />
<br />
Isaiah couldn&#39;t resist showing off his new muscles, flexing his biceps and triceps, making them bulge with power. He towered over his father, looking down at him with a mix of amusement and contempt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you, Dad,&quot; he said, his voice deeper and more powerful than ever before. &quot;You&#39;re not the man of the house anymore. You&#39;re just a little boy, weak and powerless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. He had always been the strong one, the protector of his family, and now he was small and weak, completely at the mercy of his own son.<br />
<br />
Isaiah continued to flex his muscles, making them ripple with power. He knew that his father was intimidated by him, and he enjoyed the feeling of power that came with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You used to be so big and strong, Dad,&quot; Isaiah said, his voice dripping with arrogance. &quot;But now you&#39;re just a weak little boy. You&#39;re no match for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric tried to speak, but his voice was barely a whisper. He couldn&#39;t believe how small and powerless he felt compared to his own son. He had always been the one in control, but now he was completely at Isaiah&#39;s mercy.<br />
<br />
Isaiah continued to flex his muscles, enjoying the feeling of power that came with being the man of the house. He knew that he could do whatever he wanted now, and there was nothing his father could do to stop him.</p>
