<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carrie couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. Not only had John been sucked into her art-book because of her, but he also had been transformed into one of her wolf drawings and he actually looked happy about it! As soon as John saw that Carrie turned the book to his page, he turned and looked directly at her with the happiest puppy dog look Carrie had ever seen. He even began to wag his new tail and let off some silent barks to try to get her attention.<br />
<br />
Carrie didn&#39;t really notice what John was doing, as she was too busy trying to figure out how to fix what she did to him, but she did notice an exclamation mark appear above his head for a moment and saw that he was backing up and preparing to dash directly at what he considered the fourth wall. Carrie wasn&#39;t sure what John was planning, but then the realization struck her right as John leapt out of the book and knocked her on her back. As Carrie was laying flat against the grass, it dawned on her exactly what John had become. He was huge. Her husband was a pure black fluffy toon wolf the size of a fully grown Clydesdale and was standing over her in his full PG rated glory, acting like a dog that hasn&#39;t seen his owner in days. She also noticed that Johns solid gold wedding ring had grown big enough to fit around his front right leg.<br />
<br />
Even though Carrie knew this was her husband,  she couldn&#39;t resist the urge to pet a big friendly canine like him, and he LOVED it. the amount of kisses and nuzzles she was getting from him almost made her forget that this giant friendly wolf was actually her transformed husband, and she was starting to wonder if he even remembered who he was even a few minutes ago, so she thought of a plan. She quickly broke away from his loving kisses and went to grab the partially eaten fruit that had dropped to the ground during the chaos that caused his transformation, and suddenly John stopped what he was doing and began to look worried. &quot;Aha!&quot; Carrie thought to herself, &quot;So, he does remember. Maybe if I get him to eat it, he&#39;ll change back?&quot;<br />
<br />
But as Carrie approached John with fruit in hand, he started backing away from her with a worried and cautious look in his big blue eyes.<br />
&quot;Come on John, don&#39;t you want to be human again?&quot;Carrie thought, and to her surprise, John shook his head side to side like he was trying to say no. Carrie stopped. She was surprised that he could hear her thoughts, but what shocked her more was this revelation that John actually LIKED what had happened to him after the book sucked him in. &quot;Really? Are you sure? You really want to be like this for the rest of your life?&quot; John sat down like a dog and nodded in response to Carries thought. &quot;I mean, I know you look amazing and even majestic like this, but won&#39;t it be difficult being, well... a wolf?&quot; <br />
<br />
To her surprise, John actually shrugged his shoulders in response, as if he was saying that he didn&#39;t mind it at all. Carrie was surprised at his response, but she also realized that she could suddenly interpret animal gestures so well all of a sudden. She could usually guess what an animal was trying to do, but she was never able to translate small gestures like that into complete sentences before. Perhaps that was a secondary result of what the gambler fruit did to them, but that was hardly important right now. What was more important was the fact that John seemed to be more comfortable being her loyal canine companion than he was as a husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it&#39;s alright,&quot; Said Carrie while pondering the situation they were in,&quot;but it&#39;ll take some getting used to.&quot; As she was lost in thought about what to do, she didn&#39;t pay attention to where she was walking and tripped over their suitcases, dropping the fruit on the ground in the process. The force of her bumping into the suitcases also undid the lock on John&#39;s case and it opened wide to reveal pet care supplies instead of what John had originally packed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s convenient for you John, but I guess it is appropriate. Maybe it&#39;s a sign that you might actually be better like this.&quot; In response, John happily barked and wagged his tail hard enough to send the partially eaten fruit down a nearby hole, where it hit something, and a small gambler oak sapling emerged from where it fell. With the fruit gone and Johns decision clearly made, Carrie walked over to the greatly amused kiosk worker and asked him how to make the change permanent.  In response the toon simply handed her a blue collar with a golden name tag, and when Carrie took it, the name John appeared on it in big bold letters, and Carrie went over to fit it around the happy wolfs neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you little sweetie, where should our honeymoon really begin?&quot; In response, John trotted over to their suitcases and made them disappear into his large black fluffy body, then he perked his ears up and happily pointed in a direction. &quot;Um, excuse me,&quot; Carrie said to the kiosk worker, &quot;what&#39;s in the direction he&#39;s pointing?&quot; the toon then looked at the giant wolf, smiled, and said,</p>
