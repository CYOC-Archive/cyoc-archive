<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn’t like Asher to be this furious, this mad. His uncle was really pushing his buttons. Asher’s dreams of a perfect slice of England was going up in smokes. To the badger’s dismay, his uncle’s tacky vision of 50s Americana seemed to be sprouting up more quickly than his carefully cultivated plans for fancy living. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.<br />
<br />
It also seemed that in a rather childish bid at domination, that Felix was pouring himself into these changes. Movie theaters, diners, bowling alleys, all sprouting up in such a short amount of time. It was certainly quite the blitz.<br />
<br />
Although Asher’s uncle may be older, he wasn’t wiser. At the rate Felix was going, he would surely burn himself out. Asher was already seeing the strain in his face. It was just too many changes in too short a time. The badger calmed himself down and stroked Benjamin’s cheek for reassurance as he thought of what he should do next.<br />
<br />
Asher thought hard, and then sighed. Seeing Felix driving around with his posse was setting things into perspective for him. He started this, his uncle exaggerated it, and it was like he was looking into his reflection.<br />
<br />
Or at least what his future had in store for him.<br />
<br />
No, Asher couldn’t do this anymore. He needed to be honest. Yes, that’s what a proper gentleman would do.<br />
<br />
“Honey Badger,” started Asher as he worked up his nerve. “I have something to tell you.”<br />
<br />
Benjamin tilted his head. “Why, whatever could it be, my darling?”<br />
<br />
Asher looked at the ground. “I haven’t been honest with, to tell you the truth.”<br />
<br />
“Are you saying that you ate the last biscuits?” Joked Benjamin.<br />
<br />
“No. Far from it.” The badger gulped. “I…I made you this way.”<br />
<br />
Benjamin chuckled. “Are you saying that you made me your boyfriend? I know. I remember the night fondly. I think about it often, you know. We were on a bench and- “<br />
<br />
“No. I mean yes, but no,” said a flustered Asher. “What I mean to say is that I’ve been deceiving you.”<br />
<br />
Asher’s badger boyfriend moved closer to him. “What do you mean? You know you can tell me anything, my darling.”<br />
<br />
Oh, Benjamin was such a sweet gentleman. Asher was really going to have to muster up his nerves for this confession.<br />
<br />
Asher stroked Benjamin’s waxed whiskers softly. “You’re not a badger. At least, not originally. You are…were, a human. I turned you into my badger boyfriend. My perfect gentleman from the United Kingdom,” said Asher sadly. “I just wanted someone to be with. I was so alone and-“<br />
<br />
Benjamin put his arm around Asher’s waist. As his beloved spoke to him, he could hear the honesty in his quivering voice and teary eyes. If it were anybody else, he’d be calling them a batty loon. But with Asher? He knew he was telling the truth.<br />
<br />
“And you did this without my asking for it?” Asked Benjamin quietly.<br />
<br />
Asher sighed. “Yes.”<br />
<br />
“If I asked you to do undo this, whatever you did, would you?”<br />
<br />
After a long pause, and blinking back some tears, Asher said “Yes. I don’t know if I can, though.”<br />
<br />
Benjamin took a deep breath and looked at his nervous boyfriend. He took his hand in his. “Thank you for being so honest with me, Asher. To tell you the truth, I did feel something was off today, but I couldn’t quite put a claw on it.”<br />
<br />
Asher felt a sense of relief. “Oh, I’m glad you can appreciate my honesty are we still…”<br />
<br />
“I have a lot to think about, Asher,” sighed Benjamin.<br />
<br />
“I understand,” said Asher with a quiver in his voice. “Can, can we still be friends?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, of course we can still be friends. You’re a very charming, sensitive badger. Let’s just start things back at square 1, OK?”<br />
<br />
This was one of the best-case-scenarios that Asher could’ve hoped for. After what he had done to Benjamin’s body and mind, the badger would’ve been perfectly in the right to throw him to the curb. But Benjamin had forgiven him, had accepted him. It felt like a weight was taken off of Asher’s shoulders. Literally and metaphorically. Asher’s conscious was clearer now, but there was an unexpected benefit to this. By owning up and telling Benjamin the truth, his mental load was relieved now. He didn’t have to bear the reality-shifting stress of holding someone under his control as his perfect boyfriend. His thoughts were calming down, and he felt more clear-minded since moving into this neighborhood. With their relationship re-aligned, they returned to Benjamin’s large, posh estate.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Lyon the lion smiled as he sniffed a cigar under his leonine snout. It was a real, proper, Cuban cigar. Not a knock-off from Panama or Nicaragua, but a bonafide Cuban cigar. Every tobacco aficionado knows that Cuban soil produces the best cigars. It’s a settled science. Lyon really did admire his posh friend’s good tastes in all things luxurious.<br />
<br />
Benjamin knew his stuff, didn’t he? The badger even had a proper Spanish cedar humidor to keep them tasting right and to preserve their freshness.<br />
<br />
James the hedgehog poured himself a snifter of port and clacked his glass against Lyon’s. “Cheers! For master Benjamin and his unparalleled generosity!”<br />
<br />
Lyon lifted his glass of port. “And cheers to good company,” the lion said as he sipped his port and eyed James. The pair chuckled and drank. Talking about this and that before lighting up again. Sending tendrils of clasping and curling cigar smoke into the air.<br />
<br />
After a hearty glass of port, Lyon rested his hand against the butler’s thigh and chuckled. “Sorry there, old chap.” <br />
<br />
It may have been the alcohol. Or the smoking, but a tingle ran through the hedgehog butler as Lyon stroked his thigh. It almost felt magical. Like this moment.<br />
<br />
James reached forward and started to stroke the lion’s cheek. Without consciously realizing it, he directed more changes for Lyon. Red hairs started to grow in. Sideburns at first, until the strands grew downwards to and the two separate growths met at his chin. He passionate feelings for the lion was fueling the final stage of Lyon’s changes and giving him the proper mane that he had been missing.<br />
<br />
“Please, don’t stop on my account, master Lyon,” the butler said with a hot blush.<br />
<br />
He leaned forward and gave the lion a kiss on the lips. Lyon met his kiss with his raspy blue tongue. Prodding until the barrister and hedgehog were deep in lip-lock. Tasting smoke and port. Lyon’s hair shifted to the purple-red burgundy hues of the port that they were drinking. His new mane was looking magnificent. A mane that continued to grow. Long, thick strands of burgundy handsomely framed his face. Lyon’s bushy, but well-groomed mane reached down all the way to his pecs. <br />
<br />
Reality shifted a little further as Lyon’s frame gained height and muscle. His tailored suit became wider as his shoulders broadened. Sleeves grew in circumference as arms grew bigger. The same went for his pants. As far as Lyon was aware, he had always looked like this. Had always been a buff lion with long hair and a long mane.<br />
<br />
The pair stood up and drew each other closer. James marveled at the rugby player turned barrister. Their manhoods stirred as they embraced and kissed. Lyon was careful not to prick his paws against the hedgehog’s quills, but otherwise it was a display of raw passion. Stoic, proper people loosened up a little from all that smoke and port.<br />
<br />
They grinned at each other as they started to grind a against each other. Feeling each other through their clothes. James ran his fingers through that handsome mane Lyon was sporting, feeling so attracted to him right now. It was time to get at it.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
As the fabric of reality continued to take a beating, Asher felt a slight ache. However, the sensation was momentary. Passing. He was already feeling better when Benjamin gave his back a light rub. Helping him regain his senses.<br />
<br />
The same couldn’t be said of Felix, though. A terrible migraine gripped him, and his posse of 50s throwbacks were surprised to see the greaser badger’s nose start to bleed a little.</p>
