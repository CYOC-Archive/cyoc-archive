<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Knock* *Knock*<br />
<br />
Someone knocked Adel&#39;s dormitory door. They were expecting anyone so careful they tiptoed to the dooreye and saw that it was their mother Hillary behind the door.<br />
<br />
Adel quiet they opened the door and Hillary gave Adel a surprise hug causing them to fall on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to come and check how are you doing. I thought someone had taken you.&quot; Hillary hugged in relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooom! Not while the door is open.&quot; Adel moaned in shock.<br />
<br />
As Adel closed the door and let her mom inside the home. Adel begun to make some afternoon coffee for them. Hillary sat down to the living room table which also acted as a kitchen table for Adel. She was curious about the chromium colored laptop that was open in the corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did the school provide you with a new laptop? I thought what I gave you was top of the line?&quot; Hillary asked from Adel as she begun to unpack her small purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure mom. I had it in my sidebag while I left the school today. It was some weird settings. So feel free to inspect it if you wish.&quot; Adel said as they put a blend of fine coffee powder to a pot.<br />
<br />
Hillary immediatly begun to inspect the laptop and was as surprised as Adel was while reading the oddly specific texts and very accurate history what was written in it. Without saying anything she unticked the option for &#39;unaware of the changes&#39; options and begun to straight away to mess up with the text.<br />
<br />
&quot;This reminds me of that one game from 90s. You know the one where you take care of those pixel people.&quot; Hillary said out loud as she begun to change her own settings. &quot;Let&#39;s see. It says that my beauty score is seven out of ten, but what if I change it to plus one to eight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adel turned his back to the kitchen table witnessed as her mother begun a little bit more beautiful suddenly. She gained a bit of curvature, the waist slimmed down a notch, the face became more rounded and her brown hair gained a small hint of glossiness. She looked like a mother that would be considered as a stereotypical milf in the internet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!? What happened?&quot; Adel asked as they both looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adel, what&#39;s- what&#39;s happening to you!?&quot; Hillary asked back as Adel&#39;s body begun to change too.<br />
<br />
Adel got a mix of feminine and masculine features. Making them more muscular just enough that you could see Adel&#39;s abs. Their chest gained a cup size more volume and the bulge in the panties grew an inch and a half to both girth and lenght. Adel&#39;s overall beauty score had increased too by an one step as her mother was no considered a eight out of ten.<br />
<br />
Both of them were flabbergasted and shocked as they realized that the computer was able to change a lot of things in their lives. Adel walked next to her mother and said to her mother, &quot;I&#39;m going to confirm something so don&#39;t freak out, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adel went to their profile, typed something on the chronovac laptop and backed off a little bit. Right away Adel begun to pant as Hillary noticed Adel&#39;s chest inflating like a balloon. The already large pair of chest melons were now quickly growing into size of inflatable pool toys making their size ridiculously large. Both mammaries dropping down in a tear shape as the weight begun to pile up in them. Adel had to sit down as the sudden frontal weight begun to change their gravity. It was like if she had six bags of flours stapled into her chest. Both now exceeding the size of human head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adel, sweety what did you type in the computer?&quot; Hillary asked and noticed that they had made their chest size freakish U-cup.<br />
<br />
The chest kept still expanding and growing. Going past in even the largest ever recorded breast size. The breasts pushed and pushed bigger as Adel has to drop themself from the sofa to floor to make sure that weight wouldn&#39;t rip their back. The growth stopped until Adel had gained breasts size of bean chair. Adel&#39;s school uniform had changed into a massive black t-shirt which covered the two 30 pounds tits. The t-shirt had a very tongue and cheek &#39;Massive Mega Milkers&#39; colorful text written in front. <br />
<br />
If Adel could stand without assitance the breasts would reach to their knees. This size was too inconvenient and put too much pressure on Adel&#39;s back as they tried to lift the massive mammaries. They both could feel as the dormitory&#39;s walls begun to change under their feet.<br />
<br />
Before Hillary could say anything Adel shouted that Hillary should quickly revert Adel&#39;s chest back to E-cups. Then within a short minute Adel&#39;s chest was back their normal double E cup size and they begun to swipe sweat from their forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;My sweet babypea, why did you do that?&quot; Hillary asked as she turned back to face Adel in the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two things. First I wanted to see if it really would make my breasts that big and second what would happen to me.&quot; Adel explained. &quot;So with that safe experiment I were able to conclude that this laptop is able to change anything at anytime even if the request is impossible. Not sure what it will do if it is let running longer, but I&#39;m suspecting that since you made a change to yourself. It would ripple into me. Meaning if I would had done this to you. We both would be lying in the floor right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hillary wasn&#39;t sure what to say and felt that the computer would cause more harm and good if they begun to mess with the setting too much. She was a biology researcher, but even for her this kind of machine was too much for her, but Adel convinced her mother to give it a try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sigh.... Okay, let&#39;s keep this as our secret and let&#39;s test the features for A WEEK. No more, no less. Capiche?&quot; Hillary demanded. &quot;Also don&#39;t talk about this thing or the capabilities it has to any soul ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adel nodded and rose from the floor and before they could type anything. Hillary lastly asked that they should talk about how they were going to use this. Explaining that what if a thing they typed made a change that only one of them could undo. Like what had just happened to Adel.<br />
<br />
Adel assured her mother that they wouldn&#39;t make any major changes to them, but use it on other people and animals to test things out.<br />
<br />
Hillary wasn&#39;t still as sure about using it, but for the sake of science was ready to see what kind of biological changes they could achieve with this small laptop.<br />
<br />
So they begun to think and came up with ...</p>
