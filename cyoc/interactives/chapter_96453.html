<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vandal looked at the boy, apparently named Jun. It couldn’t be a prank… how did this happen? Vandal looked at the trunks the boy was wearing. Were they responsible for this? Looking behind Jun, Vandal saw John’s clothes. Maybe if the boy wore them again he would turn back into his friend! <br />
<br />
“Yeah, um, Jun. Those look swell. Say, why don’t you go bring your clothes back so that we can leave?” Vandal asked, trying to suppress the fear and awkwardness from his tone.<br />
<br />
“Wait, already? We just got here!” Jun whined. “Oh boy, now I know what it means to deal with shitty teen attitude” Vandal thought. <br />
<br />
“Come on, just do it.”<br />
<br />
“Fine” Jun said, not that trilled on having someone tell him what to do, though he entered the dressing room and shut the curtain. “You know, you’re being kinda lame”.<br />
<br />
Vandal sighed. Whatever, at least the kid was putting on John’s clothes. Maybe this strange ordeal would end quickly enough.<br />
<br />
“There, happy now?” a voice said, stepping out of the dressing room.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t John, however. The same kid from before was now fully dressed and grabbing the trunks he had been trying out. Vandal noticed the boy wasn’t even wearing John’s clothes.<br />
<br />
Vandal was mortified. He walked past the boy and into the dressing room: there were no signs of John’s clothing. He had seen them inside right before this so-called Jun pulled the curtain. What was going on?<br />
<br />
“H-hey, Jun. Um. Do you by any chance know a guy named John?” Vandal asked, unsure of what to expect anymore.<br />
<br />
“Um, like a billion. It’s a common name, unlike mine” he laughed “Well at least here, anyway. Who is this John?”<br />
<br />
“He’s a friend of mine. 18 (like me) but a bit shorter, light curly hair, bit of a belly?”<br />
<br />
Jun shrugged his shoulders. “Nah, man. Can’t say I know him. Why do you ask?”<br />
<br />
Vandal didn’t know what to do. His friend had disappeared. No trace of him remained. Vandal sighed. “Whatever. Let’s just leave.”<br />
<br />
“You know, you’re being kind of a buzzkill. At least try something on.”<br />
<br />
The idea is ludicrous. He had seen what became of John and yet somehow Vandal felt a tingle of curiosity. Could these clothes really change him as well?<br />
<br />
“Here. Try this” Jun said, grabbing a dark red sleeveless shirt.<br />
<br />
Vandal knew he couldn’t quite fit the shirt. He looked at the tag. Age 20-23. His curiosity led the best of him. He needed to know. Could an item of clothing change him? He stepped in the dressing room and put it on.<br />
<br />
Looking at the mirror, he saw that nothing was different. He was almost disappointed by that fact.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you forgot these!” yelled Jun outside as he threw more items of clothing into the dressing room.<br />
<br />
Vandal quickly checked them out. Some denim shorts and sneakers. He noticed the items were not his size. He quickly finished up dressing the whole set of clothes and looked again at the mirror.<br />
<br />
The clothes fit him wrong. Baggy, even the sneakers were tight. They were definitely made for someone stronger, not a twig like him. But as he looked at the mirror he noticed that his chest seemed bigger. He moved a hand over and noticed that in his scrawny chest a pair of pecs had emerged. They were meaty and firm. Vandal couldn’t help but smile at the sudden muscle growth. He flexed his pectoral muscles, feeling the solid muscle and strength they possessed. But then he also noted his arms were bigger. Deltoids, biceps and triceps had inflated themselves. “Whoa” Vandal said in surprise as he also felt the burning muscles on his arms, almost like he had performed a million reps at the gym. Looking further down, his legs also grew. His thin legs expanded as his thighs and calves became huge. Meanwhile, Vandal’s feet shrunk inside the sneakers as did his legs. The decreased height only made his muscles bulge even more.<br />
<br />
Looking at the mirror, Vandal saw a very different man reflecting back. But the changes hadn’t finished just yet. His face began to change. Just as John’s had. “Oh fuck me” Vandal spoke, a voice deeper and more mature, a maturity his squared jaw and thinner face showed as well. Still, no body hair grew. He made sure to shave it all otherwise his muscles wouldn’t stand out so much. “Wait, what?” Vandal said, confused by the random thought.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, it’s the same that happened to J-Jo-Jun!” He realized. Vandal knew every aspect of himself was changing and as he looked yet again he saw that his changes were not over. His blue eyes turned to a dark brown and became slanted, just like Jun’s. His messy hair blackened and arranged itself into a fauxhawk. His skin gained a yellowish tone. As he kept looking at himself, the young Asian man lost himself in his own reflection, flexing and smiling. He could feel his cock swell, so enthralled he was in his own image. After all, he had a great body.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Daichi, hurry up already!”<br />
<br />
It was Jun outside, being a pain in the ass. A new set of memories set in the former Vandal’s mind as he left the dressing room. He was Daichi, a 21 year old muscled young man. The thin 15 year old teen was his brother, Jun. Daichi looked down at his brother. Despite attempting to get him to join the gym, Jun would much rather stay home and play some video game or haning out with his friends.<br />
<br />
Daichi noticed that the younger boy was getting really tall. He was likely going to outgrow him and yet he could be such an annoying kid at times. No matter, he loved him all the same.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go. I’m tired of being here all day” yawned Daichi.<br />
<br />
“That’s your fault! You always take so long!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, it’s not always easy finding something that fits me” The older brother replied. Although, he had to admit that was a nice problem to have.</p>
