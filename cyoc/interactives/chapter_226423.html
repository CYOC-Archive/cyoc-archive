<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s Note: The Original Author wasn’t very specific with how Paulo’s power worked so I made my own set of rules:<br />
<br />
- Paulo can transform into anyone he wants when he jerks off, all he has to do is say the word “Transform” and think of the person he wants to turn into while jerking off. While masturbating, Paulo will transform into the person he is thinking of and finishes transforming by cumming. If he doesn’t manage to cum, then the changes don’t finish and he immediately transforms back to his old self. To turn back to normal after a successful transformation, he has to cum again and say his name: Paulo.<br />
<br />
- If Paulo also wants to transform mentally, he has to say the individual’s name while masturbating. While mentally changed, Paulo will gain the identity of his new body (with their memories and personality) and easily adapt to his surroundings. For instance, after turning into Jake, he didn’t question what he was doing naked in Paulo’s room and just put on some of Paulo’s clothes.<br />
<br />
- Paulo remembers everything he does when he’s mentally transformed. The moment Paulo turns back to normal, he gains all the memories of everything that he did while transformed.<br />
<br />
- Paulo can use his power even when he has a different body. However, when he transforms mentally, he will not be aware of his power or how it works.<br />
<br />
- Paulo’s power is not limited to just masturbation. Paulo can also use it while having sex or even with a hands-free orgasm. As long as Paulo thinks of the person he wants to become, says “Transform”, and cums, then he can use his power.<br />
<br />
- Paulo’s power does not have a time limit and he can transform into anyone he wants for as long as he wants. Paulo can also use his power multiple times a day.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope these rules help structure the story a bit more. <br />
<br />
Now for the story so far, I am going to assume that Paulo somehow said “Transform” while fucking Bobby and didn’t say Bobby’s name. This means Paulo was transformed physically into Bobby but not mentally.<br />
<br />
In addition, Paulo knows all of these rules except for the mental transformation rule. This is why he didn’t know saying Jake’s name while masturbating was a bad idea and would also mentally make him like Jake.<br />
——————————————————————-<br />
<br />
Paulo groggily blinked his eyes open as he tried to come into focus with the ceiling. He felt dazed and confused not to mention odd.<br />
<br />
“That’s not my ceiling…” Paulo thought as he finally opened his eyes completely and looked around his surroundings. “And… this isn’t my room!”<br />
<br />
Paulo was surprised to see himself in a completely different bedroom instead of his own. What was he doing here? The last thing Paulo remembered was attempting to use his power to turn into Jake. However… he couldn’t recall anything after that.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a wave of new memories rushed through Paulo’s head as he began to remember what he had done as Jake: He’d gone to the bar and found a twink named Bobby to hook up with. They went to Bobby’s apartment and he began to have fuck him and then… he accidentally said the word transform!<br />
<br />
Paulo rose from the bed as he looked as his arms. He was met with a pair of smooth and thin arms with small delicate hands. Looking at his body, Paulo was met with a lanky and skinny torso. Devoid of any hair besides the small bush around a pathetic dick, one even smaller than his old one. In fact, Paulo was even shorter than he used to be. Based off what he could see, he had to be 5 foot even.<br />
<br />
“What the hell? I’m a twink!” Paulo yelled in a high-pitched and soft voice. He touched his throat, surprised at the voice he heard.<br />
<br />
Paulo never considered his old body a muscle hunk but he wasn’t exactly a twink either. Paulo was just your usual run-of-the-mill guy. He might be a bit short but he had an average amount of body hair and the standard build most guys had. He also looked and sounded masculine.<br />
<br />
However, the body he now had was less developed than his original one. Meaning he looked more like a twink and, accessing his new memories and remembering what Bobby looked like, he was certain he now was one.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Where is Bobby?” Paulo wondered as he turned his head. He remembered the two of them being on the bed while fucking but now Bobby was long gone. Suddenly, the curtain near the bedroom window slightly moved as a head peeked out.<br />
<br />
“Wh-wh-who are you? Wh-wh-why do you look like me?” a trembling voice asked.<br />
<br />
Paulo could tell from Bobby’s expression and his quivering that the twink was completely frightened. And who would blame him?<br />
<br />
“Listen, I need you to listen to me and not freak out,” Paulo said in an identical voice. “I’m going to explain everything…”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Paulo finished explaining everything to Bobby as he noticed the shaking stopping as his expression changed. Instead of looking fearful, Bobby now had a gaze of uncertainty mixed with intrigue. There was a short pause as no one said anything before Bobby spoke. “So you have a power… to turn into anyone?”<br />
<br />
“I know it’s hard to believe but it’s true. I can even prove it to you.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Bobby said excitedly, the fear now long gone and replaced with fascination. Paulo assumed that after what Bobby had witnessed and from his detailed explanation, that Bobby was finding the explanation credible and believed him.</p>
