<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Please,&quot; he whimpered as she walked around behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try and enjoy it,&quot; she whispered in his ear before giving him a nudge forward.<br />
<br />
Doug went to get his balance but found his feet frozen to the ground; unable to move.  So he fell forward with arms outstretched and caught himself so he was on hands and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;That'a boy,&quot; she proclaimed and gave him a firm slap on the ass.  This slap caused the crowd to stir up with some cheers but also had an odd effect on Doug.  His body tingled at first but it never fully subsided and he wondered if James had felt the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's she gonna be?&quot;  Asked one man, already assuming Doug's change in sex.  Happily, for now, Doug could still feel his cock and balls dangling where they had always been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we can make a game of this.  First one to properly guess the species Doug will soon be joining will get to break him in.  How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone cheered and started yelling out ideas.  Doug found it funny that they must have already forgotten what happened to the last guy that got to fuck a newly made girl but couldn't share that irony as he would fair no better.  If anything, he'd end up a mommy.<br />
<br />
He was beginning to wish he had chosen to pick his sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, boys, cut me some slack.  Raise your hands, like we're in school, and I'll pick on who I want to answer.&quot;  And again, though she was softly scolding the crowd, it was Doug who got the slap on the ass.<br />
<br />
The tingling came back and when it subsided once more, he was left feeling slightly different.  The waist of his pants was looser yet his hips felt wider.  Add that to his balls not jiggling as much as the first time and just the brush of his shirt against his nipples bringing him a sense of joy was not a good sign for his sexuality.<br />
<br />
Madame looked out over the sea of raised hands and picked one.<br />
<br />
&quot;A cow?&quot;  Asked the very excited man.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about it Doug, you gonna be a cow?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug was still trying to feel his body out while stuck bent over when he realized she was actually looking for an answer.  He shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, not a cow.  Free milk will have to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked out another raised hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hippo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hippo?&quot;  Madame said oddly.<br />
<br />
She reached over and pinched Doug's butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not enough fat on there for that.&quot; <br />
<br />
When she let go of the skin, the tingling returned and there was a pain at his backside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we have a tail coming in,&quot; she said, pointing to the little growth above his butt where his loosened waist line had exposed more skin.<br />
<br />
Everyone stepped up on their toes to get a better look but the tail was in its infancy and could go any number of ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't much to go on!&quot; someone shouted.<br />
<br />
Madame gave a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not yet.  Do you have anything to say, Dougy?&quot;<br />
<br />
And every eye went from his back to his face which was still unchanged and even still had his glasses on.  With everyone staring, Doug felt extremely exposed and nervous.  It was then Doug felt an itch in his throat and a soreness in his gums.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Doug?&quot;  Madame pressed and Doug realized she was trying to get him to reveal what he was feeling.  His mouth felt weird and so did much of his neck now.<br />
<br />
He could feel her stare burning into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel,&quot; he started but the laughter that responded caused him to blush.  Not only was his voice a few pitches high and ended in a squeak of sorts, but his front teeth were now larger and even closing his mouth didn't hide them as his upper lip bulged.<br />
<br />
Doug wanted to cry but felt himself unable for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Then her hand was on his back, on exposed skin, and she was just over his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doug, tell these fine people how you feel.&quot;  Her words were only half the pressure.  Just below her hand the tail, which had just been a nub, was growing out.<br />
<br />
Doug didn't want to speak but felt compelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel funny,&quot;-and the last syllable bled into a squeak as his whiskers grew out from either cheek.<br />
<br />
Some men laughed, others raised their hands eagerly, and a couple took pictures.  Doug's face was changing and it caused him to smile though he just wanted to yell out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you.&quot; Madame selected a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rat!&quot;  He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No but close.  You.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chipmunk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chipmunk?&quot;  Madame said with a guffaw.  &quot;With a tail like this?&quot; And she grabbed the growth, now almost a foot long, and tugged it out another foot with added fur growing in.  Also at the tug, Doug's arm slid in closer to his body.<br />
<br />
This had an unintended effect, at least unintended by him, of showing off another newly formed asset.  In all the focus on his face and tail, no one had noticed the two cantaloupe sized orbs on his chest.  With arms pressing them together and out, there was no one in the room that didn't notice now, as all the cameras could attest.<br />
<br />
A hand went up, eagerly held, in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;  Madame said pointing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Squirrel!&quot;  He declared rather than asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a winner!&quot;  At that, she tugged Doug's tail hard and grew it to nearly four feet.  But that was only the start.<br />
<br />
While everyone clapped for the winner who took his time to come around to the stairs at the side of the stage, Doug's changed accelerated.  He watched his nose grow out a little and the curve of it disappear while it flattened a little.  His lips and mouth got smaller and there was a tug on his upper lip where it joined his new nose.  Next his hearing went garbled, like being under water, and Doug felt dizzy.  If it wasn't for Madame's magic, he could have toppled.  He shut his eyes and tried to stay calm but that only allowed him to realize his heavy chest was now heavy with firm new growths.<br />
<br />
When his hearing came back and he opened his eyes, thing were differently different.  Doug still had his glasses but they had slid down a bit on his new nose's bridge.  There were also strands of light brown hair in his dangling in front of his eyes.  Giving his head a shake, he also knew his ears were now atop his head rather than on either side of it.<br />
<br />
A man in front snapped a picture on his phone, smiled as he looked at it then showed it to Doug.  He could hardly believe the image was his.<br />
<br />
The image was of a girl, with light touches of Doug, mixed with a squirrel whose fur was just starting to bud on their face.  His hair was hanging down with two little ears poking out of the top.  He could even see a tail, his tail, in the background fully grown and puffed in hair.<br />
<br />
Doug looked back at himself.  It was foreign to him with his waist and figure slimmed.  He hadn't noticed but he had gone from six feet to barely five.  His jeans were around his feet having giving up trying to stay on and his boxers were barely holding on to his rear.  Best he could, Doug pushed backwards to try and preserve those for a while longer.<br />
<br />
Doug's eyes were now looking straight down.  While he intended to not look at anything he did see the floor had gotten closer as his arms shrunk, slimmed, and his hands became dainty, furry, and tipped with small claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please no,&quot; Doug begged to no one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; said the man who had shown him what he looked like in his phone.  &quot;You look stunning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug could see in his eyes that not only that the man was being honest, but the gap mouthed squirrel girl reflected in his pupils was Doug.<br />
<br />
&quot;He, on the other hand, doesn't,&quot; and he motioned to Doug's right.<br />
<br />
He looked over and finally caught a glimpse of the man who had won.<br />
<br />
He was smaller than Doug, or at least smaller than Doug used to be, but probably weighed three hundred fifty at best.  Doug had no concept of cup size but even with what he had grown on his chest he was sure this man had bigger tits. His jowls jiggled as he eyed Doug with lusty intent.  His shaved head was red with perspiration while he licked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like the new Doug?&quot;  She asked the man, her arm draped around his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; his voice was deep and very unsettling.<br />
<br />
Another new feeling came to Doug as, at the sight of the man, his butt clenched tight along with his new slit surrounded by short, brown fur.  Sadly for Doug, this caused his boxers to fall.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to her?&quot;  Madame baited the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna tear her up.&quot;  Doug noticed, by some strange new nature, his crotch.  Like the rest of him, it was large and of no comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spoil my pretty little squirrel?&quot;  Madame sounded almost displeased but the man took no notice, undoing his fly and dropping his pants to reveal tight briefs beneath.<br />
<br />
Doug wanted to throw up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna make her howl for more,&quot; and just like that, he was storming up at Doug who could only shut his eyes and feel a kinship with James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot;  Called a voice.  Then there was a silence.<br />
<br />
Doug opened one eye, looking over the black rim of his glasses, and saw the man frozen just two steps from him.<br />
<br />
Madame walked up slowly behind the man, running her hand along his back as she did.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ain't gonna change me into no squirrel, are ya?&quot;  He asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said, giving Doug a plain look.  &quot;But neither will you besmirch my newest creation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her magic released him from his mid-stride but he just fell to hands and knees, similar to Doug, before finding himself stuck again.  The crowd was hushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, Doug,&quot; Madame spoke to him but knelt down beside the man instead.  &quot;You'll get fucked soon but not by this beast.  He doesn't deserve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug was relieved and then worried a moment later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I didn't,&quot; the man tried to plead in desperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush now,&quot; she soothed.  &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-bobby.&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Bobby,&quot; she stood up and faced the crowd, &quot;you won't be leaving today with your sex or humanity either I think.  Right boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
And the crowd cheered and began to shout out suggestions.<br />
<br />
Bobby looked over at Doug and mouthed an apology.  Doug just looked away and tried not to think about what he got himself into.</p>
