<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">2034: <br />
<br />
<br />
2034 was the year everything changed.<br />
<br />
Humanity woke to the greatest surprise they never expected. In orbit around the planet were hundreds of alien space craft. The various space <br />
agencies had looked straight through the craft, despite each being several hundred km wide. Within minutes of their detection, the aliens on <br />
board had taken over every communication frequency band available. Where possible, video was projected onto every TV, smartphone, <br />
computer and billboard.<br />
<br />
The aliens envoy, clearly a female of particular beauty, delivered a stark message to the world, her alien dialect being translated real-time by a <br />
universal translation tool. Her voice was sultry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our species is dying. Our scientists have devised a solution, but to deploy it without testing could prove fatal to us. Your species has been <br />
selected from the many across the universe due to our genetic similarities. The experiment will begin shortly, do not worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly recorded in advance, the message repeated itself multiple time as panic broke out in the streets. Politicians pondered a pre-emptive <br />
strike, but without knowing what was going to happen, accepted responding could be equally suicidal.<br />
<br />
Then it happened - high powered beams blasted from the sky to earth from each of the ships, striking at various strategic points around the <br />
globe. Once established, gigantic pulses emanated down the beams. Upon reaching the earth, the pulses spread out like waves across the <br />
planet, sweeping across the continents.<br />
<br />
Once the waves had passed, part of the aliens plan was clear. The only members of the human race left alive were female. All that remained of <br />
the other sex was dust, as if their bodies had been vaporised. Young children were confused as to why some of their friends had disappeared in <br />
front of them and a number of pregnant women were at a loss to explain the sudden change in their situation.<br />
<br />
Remaining members of state from the varying countries were quick to contact each other, some governments in more disarray than others as a <br />
result of their gender policies and decisions.<br />
<br />
Then all the TV screens lit up again, the same woman appearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for participating in Phase One of our experiment. The males of your species have been disposed of. This is to create a control <br />
situation similar to our own. <br />
<br />
Our males were eradicated by a virus - we understand the concern that we undertook such a radical simulation of the event on your species. <br />
Our scientists have devised a solution for a species to reproduce within the remaining population. As previously disclosed, since this involves a <br />
genetic restructuring at the cellular level, your species has been chosen to test the results of our experiments. <br />
<br />
Do not be alarmed at the results. We understand you may feel this unfair, but we consider the survival of our race a higher cause. We will not <br />
contact you again until the experiment has finished, although our ships will remain in orbit. Your continued participation is gratefully <br />
appreciated.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the broadcast ended, the beams started up again, striking the same positions on the planet. The waves once again spread across the planets <br />
population, rendering everyone unconscious.<br />
<br />
<br />
2037:<br />
<br />
<br />
Humanity accepted the change as best it could. The aliens brutal application of their technology in the name of 'science' threatened to rip <br />
humanity to pieces. Every member of the female species was affected, although in differing ways.<br />
<br />
The surviving elite (comprising the politicians, the think tanks and the celebrated) and their scientist cabals divided humanity into groupings, <br />
branded as 'Types', consistent with the effects of the alien technology, dubbed 'the Xenowaves'. Society, as it does, quickly reoriented itself <br />
around these groups, although less bound by gender it became a less formal, more open society. On the surface, anyway.<br />
<br />
---- TYPES -----<br />
<br />
Type 0:<br />
Human Females who, to sciences best guess, had no signs of change as a result of the wave. These 'pure' females were prized amongst the <br />
populace, often hidden from the masses, so revered was their condition. Breeding experiments were quickly undertaken on the Type 0's to <br />
ascertain if their offspring would also be Type 0 (or, more to the point, Male). <br />
<br />
The few public facing Type 0's were almost certainly celebrities or high-ranking members of the population. Some Type 0's exist on the <br />
outskirts of common knowledge, hidden from the powers that desire them for propaganda and/or tests. Officially, less than 2% of the human <br />
population are Type 0.<br />
<br />
Type 1:<br />
The most common form of 'female' following the wave, affecting almost 40% of the world. The after-effects of the wave were disturbing for the <br />
women affected in this way. Their very female self disturbed at the genetic level, many woke after the wave passed in dire pain as the change <br />
took effect.<br />
<br />
For the majority, this was either a masculine penis growing from above their female sexual organs or a suspected mutation of the clitoris into <br />
said organ. Many females have described this manifestation as worse than giving birth, such was the quick and brutal occurrence of the change <br />
in a place the body simply wasn't prepared for.<br />
<br />
Type 1's have sub groups:<br />
          Type 1a - The former result, where the penis sprouts from above the woman's vagina, as if it was a normal male's penis. Testicles may or <br />
may not be present. If they are, the woman is capable of impregnating other women. If any role was likely to take up the 'male' role in society, <br />
everyone expected it to be the Type 2's. In the end, it turned out to be the Type 1's, specifically the 1a's.<br />
<br />
          Type 1b - The clitoris forms the penis. It is more feminine - a result of its origin - lacking a defined head. Once again, testicles may be <br />
present and will often be growing out of, or located visibly inside the woman's labia, separated by the vagina.<br />
<br />
          Type 1c - More rare, the woman 'births' the penis from her vagina. The penis may curl upwards and behave like a normal penis or hang <br />
down, even when erect. The vagina is still present and functional, but awkward to access. Testicles are even rarer, and if present will fall from <br />
the vagina along with the penis, often blocking the passage.<br />
<br />
          Type 1d - This woman has no penis growth present, but does have 1, 2 or more testicles present. These may grow in similar places as <br />
Type 1a,b or c. Whilst unable to directly penetrate another woman, she is fertile and her sperm can be used to inseminate other women. When <br />
experiencing an orgasm, she will ejaculate, often with some force due to the shorter travel of the semen. Some 1d's have even been known to <br />
practice targeting as a side-show act.<br />
<br />
Type 2:<br />
Type 2's are relatively common, although nowhere near as common as Type 1's. In this case, the woman's primary sexual characteristics are <br />
entirely or fundamentally male. Some regressive female characteristics may remain, but the woman cannot bear children. <br />
<br />
These types are not openly prejudiced against, but are also not seen on the same social standing as Type 1's or 0's.  Muscle mass is generally <br />
increased as a result of the increased testosterone in their bodies with no countering hormones. Many take up jobs in manual jobs, as sex <br />
workers or in various fetish communities.<br />
<br />
The majority of Type 2's resent Type 1's on at least one level, specifically when the Type 1's talk about the pain in their transformation. For <br />
Type 2's, it has been tastefully documented to have felt like something was tearing the woman's womb out with a coat hanger then leaving <br />
them with the penis as a cruel joke.<br />
<br />
Once again, these are identified in sub groups:<br />
          Type 2a - the woman's genitals are fully male. She is capable of impregnating Type 1's. They tend to be the most 'dominant' of the Type <br />
2's, be that by social standing or temperament.  Many 2a's become sports stars as a result of their physique.<br />
<br />
          Type 2b - A penis is present, but no testicles have been identified. The woman does not ejaculate at all and doesn't climax easily <br />
meaning, assuming exhaustion doesn't take over, she can continue to engage in sexual acts for prolonged periods. Women of this type <br />
engaged in sex work are derogatorily referred to as 'fuck dolls', something most of them do not dispute. <br />
<br />
Because even 'normal' Type 2b's seen their penis as nothing but a tool, many have taken to modifying their penis - a sub culture is known of <br />
and celebrated in circles for creative piercing, tatooing, bisection/trisection or even partial/full castration.<br />
<br />
          Type 2c - No penis is present, but fully working testicles are. The woman has no function with which to ejaculate, nor experience sexual <br />
release. Her testicles are as sensitive as any other type, which lends to quite interesting foreplay, but nothing more. 2c's are often socially <br />
withdrawn as a result.<br />
<br />
Like 2b's, 2c's often look down on their 'limited' predicament and abuse/modify their genitals for artistic or sexual reasons.<br />
<br />
Type N:<br />
Type N's are extremely rare, but also extremely unfortunate. Stripped of all genitalia by the wave, they live a distant existence from the new <br />
society that has grown around the results of the experiment. <br />
<br />
Even more withdrawn than the 2c's, they often dedicate themselves to study in private to avoid interacting society. A classroom insult has <br />
arisen calling girls 'N-ers' if they are academically capable or otherwise socially withdrawn. Even worse is the cocktail of hormonal drugs the <br />
woman must take to balance her hormones, lacking as she is in all of the sex hormones. <br />
<br />
Women have been beaten up and/or killed in incidents where they have been correctly outed as Type N's in public areas, such as night clubs, a <br />
fact that has resulted in Type N's being banned from some social gatherings.<br />
<br />
Type M:<br />
A reclassification of an existing type, whether initially after the wave or over the course of the woman's life.  The M stands for mutation - be it <br />
to do with genitalia or other characteristics. Known mutations include: Additional Penises, Vaginas or Testicles, additional breasts, additional <br />
limbs, additional eyes, ears, fingers, toes, non-human growths (tails, gills, different species genitalia etc.).<br />
<br />
People officially classed as *mutated* are registered, although it carries no social connotations other than monitoring changes to the species <br />
predicament (unless the mutation is visibly embarassing, resulting in prejudice).<br />
<br />
<br />
So far, humanity has survived the experiment, although there is no end in sight. These are their stories...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
----- RULES -----<br />
<br />
No specific rules are defined, although it's probably a good idea to specify Type at the start of a thread for clarity.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</p>
