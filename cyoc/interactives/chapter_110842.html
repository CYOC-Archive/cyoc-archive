<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9 year old Nick Heart was sitting on his bed waiting nervously for something he had been fearing for almost two weeks. Two weeks ago his Mom and Dad took him to a special Doctor who tested 9 year olds to see if he carried the Were Mom gene. Just as Nick feared, he carried the gene. The doctor told Nick and his parents that he was a Were Mom and that he would turn into his mom next full moon which was two weeks from then. That was two weeks ago. <br />
<br />
It was evening and Nick was sitting in his room playing a video game to help pass the time. Earlier his Mom talked to him alone trying to comfort him and telling him that being her wasnt all that bad. She had taken the week off work to spend it with her son. The Doctor told them that Nicks mind would become more like hers even though he would still keep some of himself left. Her interest and hobbies would become his. <br />
<br />
Brandi Heart was quiet attractive for being 44 years old. She had long blonde hair, an attractive face with a hint of age, an athletic body from years of track, overall she was aging quiet well. <br />
Brandi asked Nick if he wanted her to be with him whem it happend but Nick had decided that he wanted to be alone.<br />
<br />
Nick finished the current level in his game when he noticed the sun was setting more and more. He remembered what the Doctor had told him. She said that the first change is the most painful and that he should make no attempt to resiest the change or it could kill him. There have been a handful of boys who tried to resiest the change were killed by the pain. She told him that he would get a cold sweat right before the change. Which he was feeling right now.<br />
<br />
Nick began to shivier as the sweat covered his <br />
body. He removed his shirt and shorts and pulled up a chair to his open window . He sat in the chair and watched as the last bit of the sun went down, the sky went dark, and the full moon rose. <br />
<br />
At first nothing happend and Nick thought maybe the Doctor made a mistake. Then a massive amount of pain spread through his whole body. Nick cried out and fell to the ground hunched over, loud cracks and the sound of stetching skin could be heard from him as his body began to slowly grow.<br />
He grew several ft taller until he was his mom &#39;s height of 5&quot;7. His toes popped larger and his feet cracked bigger. Flesh started to fill out first on his legs, then his arms, then his torso. His privates sucked up into him and rearranged into female genitalia, his groin area paifully cramped as they changed. <br />
His hips widend painfully first to the left then to the right. His spine cracked as his rear expanded into a larger heart shape. His stomach curved into a hourglass and a line of muscle hardend there. His arms and legs formed muscle from his moms history of track and his hands became slimmer and dainty. Nick tried pull himself up but only managed to get on his hands and knees as his spine pushed outwards all down his back. Nick felt a pain on his chest as his nipples hardned and small buds pushed out. His shoulders widened and his collar bone popped out loudly. Nicks face had already changed into a teenage version of his moms but then it suddenly began to crack and contort into a 44 year old womans. He put his hands to his growing head while a stretching noise could be heard from his chest as her breast began to grow bigger and fuller stopping at Brandi&#39;s f cups. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like five minutes the pain stopped and Nick managed to slowly stand up as his mind began to change into that of his Mom. Thoughts of his Dad and pedicures and clothes and her friends. Nick still remembered being a 9 year old boy but he felt like he had been his Mom his whole life. She looked in the full size mirror and saw his 44 year old Mom staring back at him. <br />
She put her hands on her hips and did a few sexy poses with her moms smile on her face. <br />
<br />
Nick put on the outfit his mom gave him earlier. Nick now Nichole Heart walked to the door and placed her hand on the knob. <br />
&quot;Alright Mom,&quot; She said to herself. &quot;Time to meet your twin sister for the week&quot;. As she opened the door.</p>
