<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things had been quiet for Kellie since the school year began. The girls had continued training, improving their skills and amazingly remaining on cordial terms with Jack and the others. Although still cautious Kellie was rather surprised to see things progressing so peacefully. She was even more surprised when Merlin stated he was willing to give Mia lessons in magic. “It’s better to train the girl in the ways of magic than to leave her in teachings in the hands of an imp,” Merlin had said. While Kellie was confused, she ultimately trusted her fathers instincts. As school ended for the day, and Miss Warner dismissed the class, Kellie quickly made a effort to catch up with her friends.<br />
<br />
“Hey Kellie,” Katie called. “Any plans this weekend?”<br />
<br />
“Not really,” Kellie shrugged. “Why is their anything going on?”<br />
<br />
Katie motioned towards Lisa, who had an impish smirk on her face. “Turns out Ashley is having a party,” Lisa smirked. “Her folks are out of town all weekend. Shiro and Jason asked if we wanted to go?” A small smile now spread across Kellies lips. “Sounds like fun you can count me in.”<br />
<br />
Kellie returned home that Friday afternoon, preparing for a night of fun with her friends. Chances were their would a alcohol at this party as well as the usual high school antics that always made parties like this memorable. After having to fight for her life and train to become an all powerful sorceress, a little mindless fun was just what the doctor ordered. As Kellie pulled into Ashley’s expansive driveway with Mary Elise and Karen in tow she couldn’t help but marvel at the impressive home. <br />
<br />
“Wow this place is huge,” Karen whispered. Kellie smirked as she gazed at her friends. “Yeah it’s nice,” she said. Karen and Mary Elise could only nod as they timidly trailed behind Kellie. Kellie for her part could only shake her head as she scanned the two teens. “Guessing you two haven’t been to a lot of parties?”<br />
<br />
Karen blushed as a sour look crossed Mary Elsie’s face. “Look before you say anything it’s fine Mary,” Kellie said. “Everyone we know is here. The others already texted me, their Waiting inside. Just have fun and try not to freak out.” Mary Elise frowned before taking a deep breath. “Fine,” she sighed. “But don’t think I’m going to start acting like some stereotypical high school airhead who’s obsessed with the latest fashion trends or celebrity news.”<br />
<br />
“The Thought never crossed my mind,” Kellie smirked. “Just mingle and have fun.” As the trio now entered the home they were amazed by what they saw. Ashley appeared to have gone all out as most of the upper class men from school seemed to be here. As theynscanned the crowd they could see Lisa and Kumiko happily chatting with Jason and Shiro along with a couple of guys from the swim team. Katie, Mika, and Claudia appeared to be talking with group of anthro students. The anthro rabbit girl and anthro lion boy appeared quite cheerful and although Kellie couldn’t hear what they were saying appeared to be getting along quite well with Mika and Claudia. Finally Kellie could see Samantha and Mike dancing with eachother on an impromptu dance floor in Ashley’s living room. Ashley appeared to have had the foresight to move the furniture, opening the room up for couples to dance. The Samoan teen and her boyfriend were now taking full advantage of the situation. Mary Elise shifted uncomfortably as she narrowed her eyes at numerous students gathered throughout the home. “Geez it’s like every junior and senior got an invite,” she muttered. “Yep so let’s just relax and have fun,” Kellie said as she clapped her hands onto Karen and Mary Elise’s shoulders. <br />
<br />
As the three of them made their way through the party Kellie couldn’t help but fondly remember the high school parties she had attended in her first lifetime. A soft laugh escaped her lips as she watched the high schoolers. It appeared that no matter what generation partied, somethings remained universal. Several kegs appeared to be setup in Ashley’s backyard, which several students were milling around in front of. Off to the side a group of students appeared to be playing various drinking games while another group danced. Already it appeared several students had hooked up as they made out on couches or off in the corner. Kellie just shook her head and smiled, tonight was going to be a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
“Kellie!”<br />
<br />
Kellie paused as the voice called for her, turning she sighed as she locked eyes with Jack. “What are you doing here,” she asked, sighing deeply. Jack and Sebastian approached Kellie and her friends, a smirk etched on Jacks handsome face. “What it’s only the biggest party of the year so far,” he said. “You didn’t think I would miss this would you?”<br />
<br />
“Probably not,” Kellie muttered. Glancing around Kellie now raised an eyebrow as she searched for the rest of Jacks entourage. “So where are Ayami and Rexie?”<br />
<br />
“Pretty sure Ayami is out looking for someone to hook up with,” Jack stated. “And don’t start freaking out, her killing someone is probably not going to happen. Last thing she wants to do is ruin the party before she’s had a chance to feed.”<br />
<br />
“Oh awesome,” Kellie said dryly. “So what’s Rexie up to then? Breaking shit?” Jack laughed, shaking his head as he smiled up at Kellie. “Most likely,” he said. “And it’s Lexie right now. Last time I saw her she was hanging out with a couple of the burnouts. Probably means she’s either pulling pranks or getting high as fuck.” Despite the idea of a stoned imp, she would rather have to deal with that than with Rexie pranks. “So why so glum Kel? Don’t tell me your not happy to see me?”<br />
<br />
“Not especially,” Kellie grumbled. “But I guess it was bound to happen.” Jack nodded as he noticed Sebastian now go and talk with Mary Elise and Karen. “Hey you want to get something to drink,” he asked. “Maybe hangout for awhile?”<br />
<br />
“What are you up too,” Kellie questioned. “Nothing I’m serious,” Jack responded. “I’m being serious here. Just wanted to hangout and talk. No tricks, no plans. Just two old friends getting a chance to catch up.” Kellie bit her lip, while she wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea, she knew Jack was no longer interested In destroying Kellie and her friends. Since the beginning of the school year Jack had appeared to turn over a new leaf in regards to Kellie. The handsome teen only wished to treat Kellie kindly, even going so far as to keep Ayami and Rexie in check. While he was still interested in strengthening the darkness, when it came to destroying Kellie and her friend that was in the past. “Well if we’re talking I’m definitely going to need a drink,” Kellie said pointing towards the keg. “So lead the way.” Jack smiled as he now journeyed towards the keg, Kellie trailing behind him. After pouring their drinks the two former lovers found a pair of chairs to sit in.<br />
<br />
Over the next hour the two simply talked and drank. The couple had postioned themselves relatively close to the keg, meaning they could easily refill their drinks. Unfortunately for the teens being so close to the keg also meant they were drinking a bit more than they had anticipated. Before long the two teens were definitely drunk as they laughed and talked. “So Prince of Darkness,” Kellie slurred. “You don’t want to conquer the world anymore?”<br />
<br />
“Prince of darkness huh,” Jack said, wobbling in his chair. “Real cute their apple polisher. Least I’m doing somethiin, I mean what are you and Merlin doin? Running some dusty old shop. My mom is rolling in cash right now.”<br />
<br />
“My mommy is rolling in cash,” Kellie teased. “Geez your such a mommas boy.”<br />
<br />
“Whatever daddy’s girl,” Jack snorted. “Least it’s something. I mean hey I’m like the heir to a park full of anthro demons. I have like....a whole army of darkness at my command. What do you have?”<br />
<br />
“Friends, family,” Kellie stated. “And if you think I’m interested in an army then you don’t know me very well. I’m happy that’s what matters. Can you say the same about your AWESOME life?”<br />
<br />
Jack paused, he should feel happy. As he thought about though, he wasn’t. He had power, he had friends but something was missing. “No,” he sighed sadly. “No I don’t think I can.” Kellie stared at the teen, she felt sorry for Jack. As insane as it sounded she felt bad for Jack being in pain. “Sorry,” she whispered. “Wish I could help.”<br />
<br />
Jack sighed, the smug smirk returning to his face once more. “Eh it is what it is,” he shrugged. “I mean hey I’m still me and who wouldn’t want to be me?”<br />
<br />
“And theirs the smug asshole I know way to well,” Kellie grumbled. “Figured you would sit on that pity train for too long. Shame, your actually kinda handsome when your not being a dick.”<br />
<br />
“And your cute when you’re not being a bitch,” Jack chuckled. The two drunk teens now chuckled softly as an awkward silence now descended between them. As they gazed at one another they couldn’t help feeling something stirring within them. With the benefit of alcohol the two couldn’t help but find themselves attracted to one another. They were both young, attractive, and powerful. The passion that they had between one another now began to resurface. They remembered the good times they had with one another, how passionately they felt about one another. Kellies head now was spinning not only from booze but from her feelings for Jack. Biting her lip in frustration she now leaned forward, almost falling over before kissing Jack passionately.<br />
<br />
Jack was caught off guard as Kellie kissed him. While surprised and far too drunk he quickly recovered, returning Kellies advances as he intertwined his fingers in the girls honey hair. The two now began to kiss as passionately as they one person had in their former lives. As they pulled apart the two teens now drunkenly looked at one another as common sense began to vanish. “Wanna find someplace more private,” he asked.<br />
<br />
Against her better judgement Kellie nodded as she now took Jacks hand and led him inside. If either one had been sober they would never had considered this. For now though the two teens were letting their passion and their hormones dictate their actions.</p>
