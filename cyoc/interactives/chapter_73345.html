Part One<br />
<br />
Christmas is a time of giving and receiving. Rod knew this very well. Despite his now being in his late teens and a University Student, he never ever lost that feeling of excitement as the Season of Goodwill drew ever closer. He'd been doing his Christmas Shopping and had got presents for everyone, despite having only a small amount of cash to spare. “It's the thought that counts!” he whispered to himself as he wrapped up all of his presents. This was typical of Rod; he was a caring and thoughtful person, modest and well-liked by his many friends and well-loved by his family. Little did he know that this particular Christmas would bring a gift which would be a reward for his attitude towards his friends and family and would give him a great deal of pleasure in the years to follow!<br />
<br />
“So, to whom shall I give the Power and what Form will it take?” The Great Unseen Spirit of Power mused long and hard about this. “I don't want to chose anyone who'll misuse the power I give, just someone who'll enjoy it, someone who is deserving and worthy.” The Spirit scanned the whole world. Spirits can do this in the blink of an eye. At the speed of a thought, Rod came into his mind's eye. “Now then, this young lad Rod looks like a likely candidate!” As time and space does not exist for spirits, he was able to pour over the whole of Rod's life in an instant. “Yes”, exclaimed the Spirit “he is ideal.” The Spirit then had to find a way of granting Rod this power. “I don't want to frighten him or make him feel uncomfortable in any way” said the Spirit. The Spirit entered Rod's mind. Deeply. Scanning thought, feeling, experience, attitude; everything. Then, realising the course of action to take, the Spirit decided. “It is Christmas time for Rod. He has given all he can to his friends and his family. I shall give him a present in the same way.” The Great Unseen Spirit of Power concentrated and the present, a gift of Great Power, formed. It was a small, white, plastic statuette in the form of a man dressed in very close fitting clothes. It was hollow and inside this cavity was some shampoo. The Spirit knew that Rod took care of his appearance and would use the shampoo. So, he made the head of the statuette removable. “As soon as Rod removes the head for the first time, the statue will come alive, become a real man and tell Rod just exactly what power he can wield through the statue.” This could frighten Rod, but the Spirit thought that Rod could handle it.<br />
<br />
So, it was done, in the blink of an eye. The Great Unseen Spirit of Power wrought everything that he'd thought and, as Rod and the rest of his family opened their Christmas Gifts on Christmas Morning, he found a box, wrapped in plain brown paper. On it was written “TO ROD from GUS P.” “Another present for me!” exclaimed Rod, “everyone has been so generous and kind this Christmas. Hang on though, who is this Gus P? I don't know anyone called Gus P!” “Well”, said his younger brother Mike, “you have so many friends perhaps one of them has put a present under the tree for you and didn't want you to know it was from him. Or her...” The family all laughed. Rod blushed a bit, but soon recovered his composure. “I'm sure you're right Mike. I am so fortunate to have such good friends and family, Here's to everyone and a Merry Christmas to all!”<br />
<br />
The family spent one of the happiest Christmases they'd had for a long time. When Rod surveyed all the presents he'd received from his family and friends he felt good inside. He was a little embarrassed that his presents were small, but nobody had said a word. Everyone had been delighted with what Rod had bought for them. Rod was content. Very content indeed.<br />
<br />
A few days after Christmas Holidays, Rod was looking through the bathroom for some shower gel and some shampoo. He was in a rush to have a bath before going out to spend an evening with some of his University Friends at the Student's Union. “The whole family must have spent hours in the bathroom getting ready for Christmas and New Year and used it all up!” he thought to himself. “There's none left. Hang on though...”; Rod remembered his unexpected gift of a bottle of shampoo in the form of a white statuette with tight fitting clothes. He ran, naked across the landing to his room and found the box. Opening it, he was reminded how like 'The Stig' from 'Top Gear' it looked. It even had a crash helmet covering the face. He opened the box, took out the statuette and ran back to the bathroom, locked the door and started to run a nice, hot bath. He climbed in and lay down in the lovely warm water. He turned to the statuette, picked it up and unscrewed the head...</p>
