<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a lot of back and forth about whether Benny should have his appointment before or after the wedding. Benny wanted to remain a boy and wear a tux with the other groomsmen at the ceremony. However, since the happy couple would be heading to a honeymoon after the ceremony and the move in date was set for a couple of days before, it was decided that Bianca would be attending the wedding instead. <br />
<br />
Both his dad and Isabella was busy with wedding stuff so Andrea volunteered to drive Benny to his appointment. Benny offered to drive himself but Isabella pointed out the directions said not to drive or operate heavy machinery for 24 hours after the procedure. <br />
<br />
Once checked in, they were escorted to a waiting room for soon to be ex-boys and their families. They were given a number and told to take a seat. On the wall opposite of where they entered were two double doors with a sign that read, &quot;now serving number...&quot; followed by a digital counter which currently showed 24. Benny looked at his number, 37. He sighed. &quot;We are going to be here awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea leaned over and checked his number. &quot;I hope not too long. We are supposed to have a dress fitting after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dress fitting?&quot; Benny asked as they took a seat. &quot;I thought I was still going to be standing on my dad&#39;s side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but not in a tux.&quot; Andrea informed him. &quot;Remember? The bridesmaids are wearing lavender, then groomsmen are wearing dark navy tuxedos. Mom suggested you wear a dark navy version of the bridesmaid&#39;s dress and you said, &#39;sure, whatever.&#39; Then she scheduled the fitting for the dress and you said &#39;got it.&#39; Any of this sound familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
None of this sounded familiar to Benny, but he kind of stopped listening to people in favor of wallowing in self-pity over the imminent loss of his manhood. &quot;Maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea sighed in frustration. &quot;I get this is more than a minor inconvenience but you need to actually make some decisions about what kind of girl you are going to be if you don&#39;t want our parents to make all the decisions for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benny sulked and looked around the room. There were boys of all ages waiting for their turn.  Someone emerged from beyind the double doors. The girl was in her early twenties, very curvy, and wore clothes that were a bit large on her. Obviously she hadn&#39;t brought anything to change into after her change. A guy aboutnher age stood up. &quot;Donny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Donna now.&quot; She smirked before marching up and kissing him on the lips. Wrapping his arms around her, they shared a kiss more passionate then Benny felt comfortable witnessing. One boy interrupted them by giving a wolf whistle. The two broke up blushing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on.&quot; The guy told her. &quot;Let&#39;s get that date now.&quot; They left and the sign changed to 25 with a loud buzz. A woman called, &quot;Max, it&#39;s your turn.&quot; A young boy around nine groaned, and stomped his feet as he went through the double doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he doesn&#39;t seem happy. I wonder what the story there is.&quot; Andrea mused. She turned her head towards the door. &quot;I wonder what their story was.&quot;<br />
<br />
A boy plopped down next to her. &quot;I can answer that. I&#39;ve been here a bit and I&#39;ve been collecting everyone&#39;s reasons to pass the time.&quot; He pointed towards the exit. &quot;Those two are in college. Apparently, they decided dating was too hard and that they should just date each other. They made a bet on a game to see which became the girl.&quot;His mom volunteered him for some exchange program that the boy scouts and girls scouts are trying. I&#39;m not sure the exactly how many people they are supposed to be trading, but it seems they seem to be planning to trade a couple members once a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So will he be traded back next year?&quot; Benny asked. <br />
<br />
The boy shrugged. &quot;Maybe. Maybe not. Again, I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s being handled.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy pointed at a young couple. &quot;He always wanted to be a girl and his wife is trying to be supportive. They say they are going to try and be lesbians for a bit but I think they will most likely end up with his wife switching to be the new husband eventually. We&#39;ve got a couple of court orders as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Court orders?&quot; Benny asked shocked.<br />
<br />
The boy pointed to a high-school student who sat off by himself. He appeared to be a stereotypical nerd, wearing glasses, an anime shirt, and obviously feeling awkward. &quot;That one put a camera in the girl&#39;s locker room. Apparently judge decided he would learn more by being a girl than going to juvey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he tried to peep on the locker room, and now he gets an all access pass?&quot; Andrea asked incredulously. <br />
<br />
The boy shrugged. &quot;He&#39;s bound to receive some sexual harassment at some point. Especially if the girls arrange a karmic experience for him.&quot; He then pointed at a boy who sat with his arms crossed. &quot;That one has gotten in too many fights. Someone figured he&#39;d be less violent with less testosterone. Personally, I&#39;m not sure it will work but they can control what kind of girl you become so they just have to make sure she&#39;s small and weak and he will probably be less willing to start stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benny nodded. &quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; The boy asked. &quot;I&#39;m trying to be an actor and thisnis apart of my audition. They gave me a call back, but  for a girl&#39;s part so I&#39;m getting ready for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They called you back for a girl&#39;s part?&quot; Benny asked.<br />
<br />
The boy shrugged. &quot;It happens occasionally apparently. Not exactly what I wanted, but still this could be my big break. What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Benny told him about his dad&#39;s remarriage and how his future step-mom wanted all daughters. <br />
<br />
As they talked a nine year old girl exited from the double doors, wearing the clothes of the boy who went in. She left with her mom without as much of a show as the previous couple. <br />
<br />
Benny watched as each person before him went one by one, and returned with Avery different look. The peeping Tom, who had been short to start with, was one of thenfew people who did not shrink upon changing. She did have one of the larger chests. Considered what he was told about them being able to control the type of girl you became, he wondered of the D-cups was apart of his punishment or if they just ran in her family. <br />
<br />
The young husband returned as a new wife. She kissed her wife who seemed a little uncomfortable with it. Benny figured the actor kid was right, she would probably change herself as well. The other court order returned very short, very petite, and very cute. Out of everyone, she had the most trouble with her clothes no longer fitting, having to hold her pants to keep them from falling. Looking at her, Benny was glad that they went with a straight swap. He&#39;d just look like he would if he had been born a girl, no special request like being tiny or busty. Though his mom was busty.........crap.<br />
<br />
Eventually the actor went behind the double doors and returned as a teen heart throb. Even if she didn&#39;t get the part she would be popular with the guys. Finally, Benny was next.<br />
<br />
Benny went to the back and laid down inside a pod. The whole process took about 10 minutes, and felt incredibly strange. As the sealed pod filled with a fog made of nano-bots, his skin started to tingle within 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
About 1 minute in, his nose itched. Reaching up to scratch it he realized it was smaller then before.<br />
<br />
At about 2 minutes,  his shirt seemed slightly baggy, the first sign at his shrinking. Somewhere around 4 minutes there was a tightness in his chest that only increased for the duration of the process as his breasts grew. Benny wasn&#39;t sure how long his hair had been growing but he could feel it tickling his neck around this time.<br />
<br />
The 5 minute marker was the point of no return. He felt his penis stiffen, before it began to shrink. He could feel it retract as his testicles deflated like balloons. Afterwards, at around 6 minutes his body began making a series of popping sounds as his bones altered. There was a slight ache in his story which he was sure was his organs making room for a womb, and the soreness below that was probably ovaries growing. <br />
<br />
The charges continued and accelerated. At 8 minutes he could feel the remnants of his manhood start folding in on itself, forming something that she guessed would be the lips of her vagina. <br />
<br />
Things continued until she was finally finished at 10 minutes. The pod dinged and she exited. There was a full length mirror where Bianca could examine herself before going back to the waiting room where Andrea was. Her chestnut hair fell down her back, he breasts were noticeably large without being extreme, and the soft features of her face would convince anyone she was always a girl.<br />
<br />
Bianca sighed and went to show the new her to Andrea.</p>
