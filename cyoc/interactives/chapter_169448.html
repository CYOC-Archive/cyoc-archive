<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris’s whole body hurt and he was hungry as hell, his stomach was rumbling like a monster as his eyes flicked open. He was in a hospital of some kind and for a moment he couldn’t remember why, then he saw a nurse walk by this open room door, she was a centaur and then it all came flooding back to him. Him waking up sick in his apartment, the call in to work and then to the doctor, the test which told him he had the monster flu and then the change. He was no longer Chris…well he was but he was no longer a he but a she. She rolled over to lie on her back and felt a slight pitch from her new tail, the bed cover hid some of what had changed from her view but she could see her new large chest. She moved a hand and touched them just to make sure they where real and felt of jolt, god they where sensitive as hell. The few girl friends he had loved when he would play with their breasts and now he knew why from the other side of the street. <br />
She was about to reach down and touch her new womenhood when her new cat ears flinched and turned slightly to focus in on the sound. A nurse, this one a snake woman of some kind came slithering into the room, her whole body was covered with scales and she had a cobra like hood and no legs at all.<br />
“Ah…your up, you must be hungry…I’ll call for some food.” Said the nurse with hissing added between every couple of words. <br />
“Ah…how long have I been out?” inquired Chris as she sat up, the weight on her chest made that feel very weird.<br />
“Two days.” Answered the nurse as Chris blinked. “That is very common for any change, the greater the change the longer it takes the brain and body to link up. While you where out your brain rewired itself to fit with your new body.”<br />
“I see.” Answered Chris as the nurse used a wall phone to call first for a doctor and then for some food. <br />
The doctor arrived first.<br />
“Christopher Martin.” Said the doctor this one looking mostly human aside from his super pale skin, pointed ears and deep red eyes. <br />
“Yes.” Answered Chris <br />
“Well before the food cart arrives and you fill your empty stomatic with food, lets give you a quick physical.” Said the Doctor as Chris nodded her head, her new long golden blonde hair moving much more then his old short buzz cut.<br />
The physical was rather simple, height 5’11 which was only down about 3 inches from his old male height. The weight was where he had dropped almost 100 pounds in a single day going from around 250 pounds to 165 pounds. The eye test told her she now had much sharper eye sight and her earing was much better then before. Finally they had her touch her toes and stretch and do some yoga stances, she did them with ease.<br />
“You will find your body is much more flexible, you can do things now that a normal person would only be capable of doing with years of practice to be a gymnastic.” Stated the doctor <br />
“I see.” Said Chris as the food cart arrived and all her focus shifted to the cart full of multiple different types of food. He didn’t care if it was rude but once the food was put down before her she started eating it like a mad man or rather mad women. Once the food was done, her body demanded more sleep again, this time avoiding touching herself as she sat up. She slowly walked out of the room and bumped into another centaur nurse…maybe even the same one.<br />
“Watch where you…” started the Centaur before he looked down at her. “Ah…your our new Neko.”<br />
“Yes, where is everyone?” inquired Chris<br />
“Mostly therapy or orientation classes, a lot of people are in different phases of adjusting to their new body.” Said the Centaur as he reached over and pulled a clip board from the wall. <br />
“Looks like you already had a physical, so the next phase is shopping.” Stated the Centaur<br />
“Shopping?” said Chris<br />
“Yes.” Said the Centaur “follow me.”<br />
Chris followed the Centaur down the hallway to an elevator. With another short ride down two floors they stepped out into what looked like a mini shopping mall with multiple shops full of cloths and other items for multiple different types of monster. <br />
“Maria!” yelled the Centaur at the top of his lungs as Chris looked around as far as he could see they where alone. “Maria!”<br />
“Coming…Coming.” Said a female voice as an older women, came out of one of the shops. She was tiny, she would be lucky to be four feet tall. She walked with a cane and had the air of a grandmother. She looked human aside from the pointed ears and pure silver hair. “What is it?”<br />
“We got a new Neko…and she used to be a he.” Explained the Nurse <br />
“I see, I’ll take care of her.” Said this Maria <br />
“Thanks.” Said the Centaur as he turned and headed up the elevator back to his rounds.<br />
“Hello there kid, I am Maria and I am going to help you get out of those rags.” Stated Maria with a kind but someone of a smartass tone in her voice.<br />
“Hello I am Chris.” Introduced Chris “I don’t understand really shopping?”<br />
“Well you can’t go around in the nude and your human clothing isn’t going to work well now. So we are going to get you a couple of outfits so you can dress in that during your stay.<br />
“I see….” Said Chris, he understood that “If I can ask…what are you?”<br />
“An Elf.” Answered Maria with a smile. “I am actually lucky, I was 101 and on my death bed when I transform, I have dropped maybe 30 years and if other elves are any sign I have another 100 years before me. Now let’s get you dressed.”<br />
It was among the weirdest thing Chris had ever done, they had started with underware and bras. He had guessed he had a C cup breasts and he was close turns out she was either a large C or a small D depending on the brand. In the end, she got five sets of bras and panties, mostly simple sport type bras and ones that latched in the front. They where easier to put on. The tops where mostly simple T-shirts and blouses and plain colors, white, black, red, yellow and blue. It was jeans where it got strange again, the jeans had something a kin to a fly in the back with a latch to allow her new tail out. Along with jeans where some shorts. Maria offered a skirt, but she turned it down, she wasn’t ready for that. Shoes where also simple, ankle high boots, sneakers and a pair of 1 ½ inch sold heel shoes, she didn’t want to attempt walking in high heels yet. A yellow night gown and other sleeping cloths. The rest was getting personal items, shampoo, conditioners, toothbrush and the like. <br />
“Lastly we have this.” Said Maria as she held up a box of birth control pills and condoms. <br />
“Why would I need…” started Chris only to get a glare form Maria<br />
“Unless you want to start your new like with surprise baby then you would be wise to take Birth control pills and if you have sex then use the rubbers as well.” Advised Maria as Chris saw the fight was over and knew she was right, so she took the items. She did feel more normal being in a white tank top and a pair of blue jeans then she had felt walking around in a hospital gowns. <br />
It took a few hours but Chris was done and she road the elevator back up to the main floor and walked back to her room. She was only there a few moments when her 1st doctor, the werewolf returned.<br />
“Hello Miss Martin…how are you doing?” inquired the werewolf<br />
“I am ok…this just feels weird.” Said Chris<br />
“I figured…well if you are feeling up to it you can go to therapy or go to class to learn how to take care of your new female body, or you could call your family that is also recommended.” Stated the Doctor</p>
