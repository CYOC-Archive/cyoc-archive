<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now those dragon-kin female maternal instincts of yours<br />
were a bit slow to wake up,and Inspector-Guard Marple could see they<br />
needed a good jolt.<br />
<br />
After all she&#39;d just seen Chill trundling off with your six little darlings <br />
rolling about precariously on a rattling cart with a bumpy wheel.<br />
<br />
Normally a dragon-kin mother who&#39;d just given birth would be so stoned high with the maternal rush that she&#39;d have been sitting on top of the cart<br />
squatting down on her eggs,to protect them from a ex-egg stealing abductor such as Chill.<br />
<br />
So the Inspector-General had spun around and trotted beside Chill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not what you think&quot; protested Chill,as he brought the cart<br />
to a halt in the hallway.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Thats not the way I hear it from my contacts&quot; said the<br />
Inspector-General in her bad cop voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I checked&quot; said the head of the reproductive crimes unit Marple<br />
<br />
     &quot; Your brother Frost just got released from prison 2 weeks <br />
ago.About the same time that Earther turned dragoness-kin was found in the  sarcophagus in the Fordidden Ruins&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,you think me and Frost are preying on a new breeder<br />
to trick her out of her kids&quot; said Chill,the ex abductor &quot;I&#39;ve<br />
reformed&quot;<br />
<br />
         &quot;Don&#39;t jerk with me&quot;said Marple<br />
<br />
&quot; You and I and just about everyone else on Lucindra knows you male dragon-kin<br />
and all humanity covet us female dragon-kin for our power to naturally<br />
longevity hormones &quot;glowered Marple at the scowling male dragon-kin who had gathered around her and Chill.<br />
<br />
          Frost stepped forward,with a adoring Pitch right beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t the reproductive heat&quot; said the ex-(maybe) egg stealing<br />
crime boss in the West side of Lucindra City &quot; We&#39;zz just taking whats<br />
naturally ours &quot;glowered Frost back at a equally glaring Inspector-Guard<br />
<br />
        One of the other guys stepped aside and explained it all to the confused reader<br />
&quot; Wayback when when both male and female dragon-kin could expect a lifespan<br />
of about 50,000 years each,times had been good.Then somebody playing<br />
with notions of conquering the entire galaxy with endless armies of<br />
dragon-kin Storm Troopers had mucked about with the biology of the <br />
females and males,which in the end had left females with a lifespan of about<br />
a million years and a whole host of reproductive issues  and subject <br />
to the whims of their uterus&#39;s.Basically the girls were all promiscuous sluts now,always making babies pretty well non-stop for their extra<br />
950,000 years added lifespan.Just what any universe dominating dictator needed to create those<br />
endless armies of Storm Troopers.<br />
<br />
The guys had been pretty ticked off that they could now count on dying at the relatively young age of 1,000.However they&#39;d been boosted in the <br />
military and advanced governance and diplomacy department.<br />
<br />
Hence they&#39;d quickly learned to run things and soon the females <br />
had gladly thrown away their right to vote for the right to lose their virginity.<br />
<br />
This male dragon-kin,a scholar named Talesin,continued<br />
<br />
&quot; So it hadn&#39;t taken long before females such as you had lost the <br />
right to vote,the right to own property till in the end the only thing you<br />
and the sisterhood still owned were your bodies,the fluids they produced and most importantly,the baby-eggs that you gave birth to.<br />
<br />
Which was a token of possession that long ago dictator had wired into your very female being.<br />
<br />
So no,you wouldn&#39;t have just let Chill trundle off with that cart<br />
under normal conditions&quot;<br />
<br />
So Talesin stepped back into the crowd of onlooking males and<br />
Frost,ex-egg stealing crime boss  of the West side,<br />
<br />
        &quot; Hey,Pitch my new buddy has got a rich uncle in the <br />
Egg-Registration Department who got me a job after<br />
I&#39;d done my time&quot; he said as he put on his &lt;Who Me?&quot;<br />
look for the gathered crowd<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m legit now&quot;<br />
<br />
          &quot; In that case you won&#39;t mind if I have Chill<br />
trundle these eggs back to their rightful mother&quot; said <br />
Inspector-Guard Marple<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all &quot; said both Chill and Frost simultaneously<br />
<br />
   So there you were sitting in the birthing cave when Chill and the others came back with the cart of your eggs.<br />
<br />
Dr Jade Jeckyll had come in as well,after her cousin Talesin Jeckyll <br />
had sent her a note about the &quot;dullard female&quot;<br />
<br />
You just sat there staring at the oval things sitting in the cart in front of you,and the sight of them wasn&#39;t sparking much in the way of<br />
the maternal drive in you.<br />
<br />
Jeckyl slid on the long plastic surgeons gloves and then<br />
pulled off your blouse and stared with dissaproval at your rather<br />
shrunken and small breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your longevity is directly related to the ability of your <br />
ovum gland to produce the maternal instinct hormones &quot; she<br />
told you as she tapped along your belly behind which was housed all that ickky female dragon-kin stuff you knew had to exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong with me&quot; you asked her as your heart<br />
started beating more irregularly<br />
<br />
         &quot;Probably not&quot; she told you &quot;You&#39;re not the first male human<br />
turned female dragon-kin in our medical records.&quot; she said as she slopped up her scaly hands and arms in a pail of goo she&#39;d brought <br />
with her.Then she looked up at you<br />
<br />
        &quot; I have to go inside to make sure everythings in order,Aqua&quot;<br />
she told you in a questioning tone<br />
<br />
She was the doctor so you nodded your head.<br />
<br />
She thrust in a gooey hand and arm forcefully and quickly before<br />
you had the chance to clamp down on her arm with your birthing muscles.<br />
<br />
She grunted in pain as you reflexively tried to push out the foreign object sitting inside more most private female part,but the anathestic<br />
in the goo soon left those birthing muscles relaxed,but with a rising dull pain somewhere in your belly.<br />
<br />
&quot; You&#39;ve just given birth&quot; she said as she began feeling around inside your uterus.<br />
<br />
         &quot; your afterbirth is still sitting in there however&quot;<br />
she said &quot;however everything<br />
else feels alright in there.Just a bit of transfemme species <br />
shock it seems&quot; she said<br />
<br />
&quot;So now what?&quot; you asked her just before you yelped in pain as<br />
she swiftly yanked out her bloody black goo covered arm<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we give you a booster shot&quot; she said as she washed all the slime and goo off her hand and arm in a warm pail of water<br />
<br />
       &quot;This here is the most powerful hormonal booster in my cabinet&quot;<br />
Dr Jeckyll said as she waved the syringe with the needle<br />
in front of your eyes<br />
<br />
         &quot;Its derived from a extract from the egg sacs of feral wild<br />
dragonesses.Guaranteed to shut down the higher brain functions for at least  nine hours&quot; she said<br />
<br />
      &quot;What?&quot; you said somewhat dumbly<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be your last word for a while&quot; she said as Jade shoved the needle in your belly and injected you.<br />
<br />
Your head snapped back as your jaws snapped open impossibly wide.<br />
<br />
As your heaving chest tried to support your swelling milk producing <br />
mammaries,you suddenly went into violet labour pains as you pushed the slimy black and red afterbirth strands,sacs and cords out of your<br />
genital vent involuntarily.<br />
<br />
At the same time you slid onto the cave floor and heaved away as you tried<br />
to remember how to talk and walk again.<br />
<br />
To no avail.<br />
<br />
As your suddenly more flexible tail began whipping back and forth <br />
Dr Jade Jeckyll scooped up your afterbirth that you were still pushing out with each push,and brought the crud to the six eggs,smeared them in it,then placed them ,still covered in your stuff in a makeshift nest near you.<br />
<br />
Your nostrils were heaving as she came back and smeared the enticing aromatic stuff<br />
on your stretching teats,your genital vent and inside your sprung open jaws.<br />
<br />
Whatever switch contolled more more logical and rational mind clicked off and you rolled over onto all fours<br />
and ran in a four legged gait towards your baby-eggs in their nest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Garkkk&quot; was the most Pitch and Chill could get out of you <br />
for the next while as you defended youregg-babies from any nest-raiders.</p>
