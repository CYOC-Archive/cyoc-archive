<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah taps Jason&#39;s thigh, as he is taking his time to recover from the latest &#39;punishment&#39;, and asks him to take another look at the mirror to confirm something for her.<br />
<br />
Jason comes back to his senses and decides to do as she says, and poses in such a way that they both can get a view of their body.<br />
<br />
The earlier puffy chest now has a clear softness, forming a curve that is clearly a breast, and on top of that, any hair that remained on Jason&#39;s body that wasn&#39;t on his head and pelvis is almost completely gone, and he can see that his hair was not as short as it used to be, on top of his 5 o&#39;clock shadow disappearing.<br />
<br />
Jason starts freaking out again before Sarah calms him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, champ, calm down, it is temporary, you know it, just hold on, we can call the Doc and get his professional opinion, we already discussed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, OK, I will calm down, let&#39;s call the Doc and he will explain it.&quot; Jason finally recomposes and goes looking for some way to call the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Upon the computer he sees a phone with a few numbers on the side showing places in the house. It seems like this place is way bigger on the inside than the outside by the amount of possible places to call. He sees something about the lab, and guesses it must be the Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, hello, is the Doctor there.&quot; Says Jason, in a hurried tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, here everyone is a doctor, you will have to be more specific.&quot; Replies a female voice.<br />
<br />
Jason tries to remember the Doctor&#39;s name, but he remember that he never asked, and then he panic asks Sarah. Annoyed by how lost he is, she asks him to give her the phone, that she held with her cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, we need to talk to Dr. Rolland, he will know us as Sarah and Jason, we need a visit from him to evaluate the progress of our case.&quot; Said Sarah to the other voice in the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you are Sarah, nice to meet you, I&#39;m Joan,  I will call Dr. Rolland, he told us from the to lab to keep him updated if you came looking for him.&quot; Said Joan, in a jovial tone. &quot;Hey Dr. Rolland, Sarah and some one lady is on the line looking for you.&quot; Joan screamed on the other side, to the point that even Jason could hear her voice and got a little conscious about his voice.<br />
<br />
Sarah can hear Dr. Rolland picking up the phone in a hurry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hoh, Sarah...is everything OK, did something serious happen?&quot; Dr. Rolland rapidfires, kind of worried in tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing serious, we are fine, we just had some changes that we think would be interesting for you to look into.&quot; Replied Sarah, trying to assuade the doctor&#39;s worries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, amazing, good to hear, we still have like, some things to finish for now here at the lab, would you mind waiting a little, about half an hour, before we see each other?&quot; Asked Dr. Rolland, trying to fit them into his day&#39;s schedulle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it is perfectly fine Doc, we can wait, so half hour it is.&quot; Replied Sarah, happy that the Rolland would come to survey the changes and make Jason stop worrying about everything.<br />
<br />
That is when they take a look at the room and remember that they had left a lot of &quot;protein mix&quot; all around the floor and bedshits. In a hurry Jason tries to clean the room, but the best he can do is remove the spots on the floor and the bed is still wet by the time the Doctor arrives and knocks at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jason, Sarah, I brought Dr. Joan too, as she was interested on your case, do you mind if I bring her in?&quot; Asked Dr. Rolland politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a sec...&quot; Said Jason before being cut by Sarah saying &quot;You can enter Doc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus Rolland opens the door while talking to Joan and the 2 end up seeing something akin to a well endowed butch amazon, completely naked, in front of them, getting startled and dropping part of their equipment on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodness gracious, what have you two been doing to end up like that?&quot; Asked Dr. Rolland, completely surprised by how different the 2 are from when he last saw them yesterday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodness gracious indeed. Woah!&quot; Said Dr. Joan, trying to lighten the mood, completely oblivious to Jason&#39;s and Sarah&#39;s appearance from last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Doc, that is what we wanted you to take a look for us.&quot; Asked Jason, in his high voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-w-well, let&#39;s d-do the triage.&quot; Said Dr. Rolland, trying to chill from the amount of changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah Dr. Rolland, let&#39;s do this.&quot; Said Dr. Joan as she helped him prepare the equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Doc&quot; Replied Jason moving into the special chair with half a seat so that he could finally sit properly in a day.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-so, how have you two been feeling, are there any discomphort or side effects that you want to point out for us to look into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, mostly the obvious ones.&quot; Said Jason, trying not to dwel too much on the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, like, we have no discomphort, quite the opposite...&quot; Sarah giggles &quot;...it is just, those changes are going pretty fast. That is just it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is interesting, let&#39;s start the tests and than we can discuss the findings.&quot; Said Dr. Rolland.<br />
<br />
After a few blood and sensorial tests, the Drs. start their discussion about the events.<br />
<br />
During the exam, Jason as finally had time to pay attention to Rolland and his colleage, Joan.<br />
<br />
Rolland is a short, kind of chubby fellow with a bushy mustache a not so short head of hair that is graying, he probably looked in his late 50s.<br />
<br />
Joan looked like she was into the same age range, but unlike Rolland, she was very tall and slim, with her long hair held in a bun over the back of her head, artificially collored a deep blue color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, from yesterday to today, Jason&#39;s body has pretty much been changing rapidly, growing characteristics similar to mine. I knew that in your prior theories, something like that would happen at some point, but your prediction pushed those changes to be way more gradual and taking probably the length of the entire recovery process.&quot; Said Sarah in a technical tone, knowing the Rolland would understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is interesting, because this is uncharted territory for us, the solution was made mostly to allow for smart grafting or organs and limbs, the whole thing tries to replicate the original structures as much as possible before reaching a balance point. But we only used it on replacing limbs, and as such, the balance points where pretty light in changes. You are the first subject to have like, the majority of a redundant body absorbed into you, and this whole thing has been new to us.&quot; Replied Rolland, trying to create a new theory for their changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you two recount the events of yesterday, so we can have good data on this whole thing? It is extremely valuable, since you could be the first proof of the upper limits of our solution.&quot; Said Dr. Joan, kind of excited about the possibilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Doc, I prefer not to get in details.&quot; Said Jason, with a red face.<br />
<br />
&quot;We fucked and jerked off, Doc, stop being a baby Jason, we are all adults in here, they know those things happen.&quot; Said Sarah, in a tone that can only be described as &#39;full of this shit&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit Sarah, you don&#39;t have to say it like that.&quot; Said Jason, not knowing where to hide his face.<br />
<br />
Both doctors also got their faces red, but they kept their composure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, so you think this might be connected to those changes happening so fast? Do you think there is a correlation Sarah?&quot; Asked Joan, brewing a theory on her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, I have realised that every time we activated multiple processes of our body, either through sexual stimulus or exercise, the changes would happen almost instantly.&quot; Said Sarah, proving that she was paying attention to it the whole time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting. What do you think Dr. Joan.&quot; Asked Rolland, also cooking some theories of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have an idea. This whole acceleration of the change might be a more extreme version of the observed effects of the the serum on prior subjects. We have realised that using the implanted organs or limbs greatly improved their recovery rate, reaching the balance point faster than other examples. Maybe the aerolized version of the solution that entered your body and the amount of mass absorbed is causing the changes to move in an extremely fast pace. If this is true, we might have found a breakthrough that will be going to change the direction of this research completely.&quot; Said Dr. Joan, excited about the prospect of the data she could get from this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, it is the same conclusion as mine. We would need to test it. Jason and Sarah, would you be willing participate on some live tests to check if this theory holds true?&quot; Asked Dr. Rolland, knowing that Jason would probably say no, but hopping for a yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, yes, I would like to test it doctor.&quot; Replied Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait yes?&quot; Asked Sarah, perplexed that he is finally doing things on his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but only on one condition.&quot; Said Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what it be Jason?&quot; Asked Rolland.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get to keep the cock and the muscles after you remove Sarah.&quot; Replied Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahahaha, never change Jason, never change.&quot; Laughed Sarah, knowing that his enthusiasm was unlike him.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-well, OK.&quot; Replied Rolland, knowing that it would be easy to do that.<br />
<br />
They put an hospital gown and accompany the 2 doctors to one of the sub labs for the tests.</p>
