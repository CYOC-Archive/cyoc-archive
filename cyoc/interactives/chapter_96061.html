<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pressure in Faye&#39;s tail was building to almost unbearable levels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Mary, &quot; said Faye, trying to get her attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, you idiot,&quot; said Mary sternly. &quot;Every time you interrupt me, it slows me down, and we lose valuable time. So keep your big mouth shut.&quot;  Mary&#39;s anger surprised her.  She was usually very easy-going, and rarely said a harsh word to anyone.  Could it be an effect of the vial?  She thought she remembered that dragons had short tempers, but since everything written about them was fiction, who knew what was true.  In truth, it was getting harder to form rational thoughts.  She thought it was due to her pain and anxiety, but now she wasn&#39;t so sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha, I found it, &quot; said Mary, as she grabbed the vial from the box.  Just as she turned, she was smacked in the face by what appeared to be a large tree trunk.  The vial slipped from her grasp  and fell to the floor.  Using her strength, Mary tried to push the object away, and was surprised to find that it was warm and scaly. Oh no, thought Mary, Faye&#39;s tail is growing again.<br />
<br />
Faye had maintained her silence as long as she could.  She knew Mary was trying to help her, but she could be so mean.  It kinda made of her angry.  It wasn&#39;t her fault that Mary brought he vials home. Mary should have warned her about the effects.  It was really all her fault.  Faye&#39;s simple thoughts were blotted out by intense pain, as her large tail suddenly experienced another round of explosive growth, quickly doubling in size and girth.  Faye&#39;s small body relative to the long tail made her look like some bizarre kind of snake.  As the tail grew it quickly filled the small space of their living room, extending through the large double doors of the kitchen and ending out a window into the back yard.  <br />
<br />
Mary struggled to push the massive tail out of the way, without success.  The vial was just under her tail, but it as just too heavy to move.  &quot;Faye, can you hear me?&quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, &quot;said Faye weakly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to try to move your tail.  We have the cure, but it is just under your tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll try, &quot;said Faye.  She closed her eyes and concentrated. Slowly, the tail raised just a few inches above the floor.  Mary quickly reached under and grabbed the vial.  Without a second thought, he uncapped the vial and drank the contents.  &quot;Thanks Faye, &quot;said Mary.  &quot;I&#39;ve got the cure.  I just need to refill the vial, and then I&#39;ll give it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You drank it first?  Even though I&#39;m in more pain?! &quot; said Faye with a tinge of anger.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll just take a second to refill it, &quot; said Mary.  Strangely, her shoulders and arms still felt odd, almost painful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry it up!  My legs are starting to hurt really bad.  Its like an itch you cant scratch and the worst Charlie horse you ever had combined, &quot; said Faye with more than a hint of anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Okay,&quot; said Mary.  She placed the vial in the box, and watched it refill.  She lifted it out of the box, then dropped to the ground in intense pain, losing the vial on the ground in the process.  Scales rapidly spread up her back as her thorax rapidly expanded. Her breast shrank and were covered by thick scales and muscle.  Large sharp spikes ripped through the scales on her back along her spine.  The scales continued spreading down her arms, which grew in size and length.  Finally, her hands lengthened into paws, her thumb receded into a dew claw, and thick claws extended from her digits.  Finally, her pain was over. What happened, she thought.  I took the cure.  I guess it takes a while for the effect to kick in. <br />
<br />
She stood and was amazed to see a massive thigh as thick as her entire body facing her.  The thigh was covered in thick black scales, with occasional spikes poking through.  Apparently, Faye had grown a little too.  &quot;Faye, are you okay, &quot;asked Mary.<br />
<br />
After a long period of since, Faye replied.  &quot;I think so.  But, Mary you have to hurry.  It hurts so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary dropped to the ground to look for the vial.  Her new digitigrade felt disturbingly more natural.  She located the vial, and started to pick it up.  She stopped and stared at her paws, quickly realizing that without her thumbs, this would be impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Faye, I can&#39;t get the vial for you.  I don&#39;t have thumbs anymore, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;What! &quot;said Faye with a bellow.  Mary watched with disturbing fashion s Faye&#39;s large clawed paws clenched and unclenched in apparent anger.  Faye&#39;s size was truly disturbing.  As Mary watched, her clawed feet seemed to be getting even larger.  Pretty soon, Faye&#39;s growing body would occupy even more space, blocking any hope of escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to get help, Faye.  Just hold on and I will be back, &quot;said Mary, as she maneuvered around Faye&#39;s limbs toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo!!! &quot; bellowed Faye.  &quot;Don&#39;t leave me here.  Don&#39;t leave me in pain.  I can&#39;t take much more of this.  It hurts so much, and I feel so weird.  It&#39;s your fault I&#39;m like this, Mary.  If you leave I&#39;ll get you.  I&#39;ll never forget your betrayal. I&#39;ll get you, Mary, I promise.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Faye&#39;s words frightened Mary, but what choice did see have.  She leapt through the front door, knocking it out of the frame and ran into the night looking for help.</p>
