<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want those two bitches dumped,” Claudia raged. Katie nodded as Kellie handed her the ring. “Okay,” she whispered. “Here goes nothing.”<br />
<br />
Katie made a wish as the others watched anxiously. Slowly they could see Nate and Alex were beginning to grow older. The high school juniors now looked like college freshman as their bodies began to fill with muscle. The girls watched as the teens faces became more angular and adult, losing the softness of their teenage years as they entered their twenties. As the progression completed the two teens were now 21 year old college students. <br />
<br />
“So Alex, Nate,” Ashley purred. “What should we do now.” The two college men now looked at the teens with alarm. “Say uh Ashley,” Nate said. “Look, you seem like a nice kid but your a bit young for me.” Ashley gaped at the college age Nate in alarm. “But babe,” she mumbled. “I thought we were gonna hang today....maybe get a little personal. I have the house to myself till seven.”<br />
<br />
Alex and Nate began to laugh as they shook their heads. “Oh man,” Alex laughed. “Seriously kid your cute and all but geez so high school. Look we had some fun but we gotta run.” Alex and Nate turned and walked away as Ashley gaped at them. “Fine just walk away,” Jennifer screamed as she tried to comfort her friend. “You gotta a tiny prick anyway asshole!”<br />
<br />
Ashley and Jennifer now stewed as they had been publicly dumped by Nate and Alex. Claudia smiled as she turned to Katie. “Thanks for that,” she smiled. “It’s a good start. Now Mika. Bae. You think you can help me finish this?”<br />
<br />
Mika wiped her eyes on her sleeve before nodding. Katie and the others now watched as Mika and Claudia began to slowly walk towards Ashley and Jennifer. As the two began to approach Jennifer and Ashley saw them. Smiling sickly the two began to giggle. <br />
<br />
“Why look Ash it’s the newest members of the Indigo Girls.” <br />
<br />
“Tell me Claud, how does Asian taco taste?” Ashley smirked as she saw Mika and Claudia grimace, only causing her smile to grow wider. “Uh oh Jen,” she said in mock shock. “Looks like someone’s having a bad day. Tell me girls, do mommy and daddy not approve of your alternative lifestyle?”<br />
<br />
Claudia grit her teeth while Mika grimaced, fresh tears beginning to form in her eyes. “Shut up,” she spat, wiping her cheek. Ashley and Jennifer continued to laugh and mock them as they walked towards them. “Oh poor little Mika,” Ashley sang. “Such a disappointment to mom and dad. Maybe Claudia should give you a spanking. I bet you would like that huh?” The two girls burst into another fit of laughter causing Mika and Claudia to once again wince. <br />
<br />
“FUCK! YOU!” Claudia screamed as she lunged at Ashley. Ashley’s eyes bulged as Claudia connected with a vicious punch knocking the girl to the ground with a bloody nose. Jennifer looked at her friend dumbstruck as Mika lunged at her. The emotional Asian girl now half screamed, half cried as she grabbed the girl by her hair and punched her.<br />
<br />
Katie and the others now watched horror struck as a vicious fight broke out between the four girls. Ashley scratched Claudia’s face and pulled her hair attempting to sit up. Meanwhile Jennifer pushed Mika away delivering a devasting kick to her ribs. Even from a distance it sounded like Jennifer may of broken one of Mika’s ribs. Mika began to cough and spit blood. Quickly recovering and fueled by hatred she lunged at Jennifer punching her square in the face. Another crack was heard as the girl grabbed for her nose, blood running through her fingers, her perfect nose now broken. The four now tumbled backwards into a melee knocking over chairs and sending people scattering.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” Mary Elise screamed. “We need to get them out of here, LOOK!”<br />
<br />
Katie turned to where Mary Elise was pointing, mall security was now sprinting towards the four girls. Katie watched as two security officers now attempted to break the girls up to no avail. As soon as one would be seperated the other would leap over them and deliver a blow to the other. Realizing they were going to need back they quickly attempted to put out a call for more help. Katie looked at the others before sprinting.  “Come on,” she yelled. Seeing their chance the girls ran towards the melee.<br />
<br />
Claudia, Mika, Ashley and Jennifer were now bloodied and bruised from the fight. The girls clothing was torn and disheveled with numerous cuts on their faces and arms. Their bloodlust still not satisfied they screamed like banshees as they continued throwing punches and kicks. Katie was the first to reach her friends, grabbing a bloody Mika and pulling her backwards. “We have to go,” she screamed. “NOW!” <br />
<br />
Mika shook her head as if coming out of a haze. Taking a moment to assess  the situation she realized that if they didn’t leave now they could be in serious trouble. “Claud we gotta go,” Claudia looked up at her bloodied girlfriend then down at Ashley. She had Ashley by the throat currently and could see her gasping for air through bloody lips. Turning she could see more security barreling down towards their position. They needed to leave now. Throwing one more punch she connected, hitting Ashley square in the eye causing the girl to yelp in pain. Separating from the girl as quickly as she could she took her girlfriends hand and started running. Security seeing them began to give chase. “Hey you stop!” <br />
<br />
Katie and the others now tried to help Mika and Claudia get away by throwing a couple of nearby chairs to the floor in hopes of slowing them down. Katie stared as mall security tripped over the chairs and crashed to the floor. While they attempted to untangle themselves she could see Ashley and Jennifer slink away undetected by the security. They were useing Katie’s escape to make their own and it had succeeded. Now, if anyone was going to get in trouble it would be them. <br />
<br />
The six girls now scrambled through the mall carrying their injured friends with them as quickly as they could. “Quick,” Samantha yelled. “Who has a car?” Claudia reached into her purse and produced a set of keys. “That way,” she croaked. Taking the keys from her Mary Elise now tried to lead the way outside with mall security still in hot pursuit. <br />
<br />
“Where is it?” Kellie asked as she frantically scanned the parking garage. Mika motioned towards a white minivan about 50 feet away. The girls quickly grabbed the injured Mika and Claudia and dragged them towards the van while Mary Elise attempted to hit the auto start. As they ran across the parking lot Katie could hear mall security burst through the door behind them. “All of you stop right there!” They screamed. Looking over her shoulder Katie could see at least a dozen security officers sprinting in her direction. Quickly an idea crossed her mind. “Mary, Sammy, Kellie get them in the car,” she yelled. The girls obliged as Katie turned to face security. “I wish they were all 90,” she said. <br />
<br />
Katie watched as the security officers began to slow. The men were between 25 and 40, Katie could see the grey hair and wrinkles envelope them almost immediately as they rapidly began to age. In only seconds Katie watched as they slowed and collapsed to the ground. Time seemed to sweep over them quickly and ravaged their bodies as they all looked to be frail elderly men. “Stop,” They croaked befor collapsing. Katie stared in horror, she had never seen someone age so rapidly. In only moments they men were sucked dry of all their youth leaving them decrepit old men on the verge of death. Turning she ran towards the van and lept in. <br />
<br />
Mary Elise sat in the driver seat while Kellie and Sammy tended to Mika and Claudia in the back. Flinging herself into the passenger seat she looked at Mary. “Floor it,” she screamed. “My house.” Mary obliged as the van rocketed out of the parking garage towards the mall exit. As they sped away Katie silently wished the security team to return to their proper ages, a tingle from the ring seemed to tell her that her wish had been granted. As she now surveyed her bloody and bruised friends she now thought of how she was going’s to explain all this to Aunt Lisa.</p>
