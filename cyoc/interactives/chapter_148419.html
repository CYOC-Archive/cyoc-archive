<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was nervous but excited.  He was reluctant to join his friends on vacation, but they ultimately convinced him that a no consequence weekend of fun might be what he needed to break out of his shell.  Mark was a okay looking guy with a medium build and an average height of 5&#39; 10&#39;&#39;.  Unfortunately, his awkward, somewhat reclusive personality caused him to spend most of his freshman year in his room watching Netflix and playing video games with the other guys in his dorm.  <br />
<br />
As he fell asleep on a table in the VR lab, Mark braced himself for an abrupt start to his week.  Drew, the loudest of his friends, convinced the rest of the group that they should jump immediately into their holiday plans.  Mark didn&#39;t know exactly what that meant but, knowing Drew, Mark half expected to find himself immediately plastered in a nightclub or mid sex with some holographic girl.  It was a very poorly kept secret that Mark was a virgin and he was absolutely certain that Drew  requested vacation modifications to change that fact.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Mark found himself being gently lulled awake by a calm, growing white noise.  After a few seconds he started to recognize it as the sound of a jet cabin.  This thought was confirmed a minute later by the sound of a stewardess calling out over a PA system.  Mark&#39;s plane was twenty minutes away from landing.  <br />
<br />
He was hesitant to wake-up at first, it felt like he was waking from the deepest sleep of his life.  However, the turbulence of their slow decent was causing his head to gently vibrate against the wall of the plane and the feeling of unfamiliar clothes on his body made him uncomfortable.  When he opened his eyes, he saw something confusing.  Long, black strands of hair curtained his vision.  He mildly expected the guys to change his body, but he didn&#39;t expect long hair.  He reached up and groggily pulled his hair behind his ear, but paused for a minute after his body was struck by a few unfamiliar sensations.  His arm felt as light as a feather and his bicep made contact with something confusing it passed by his chest.  Trying to take stock of his situation, Mark also noticed the feeling of sweat pooling oddly around his body.  He moved his hand to wipe the sweat from the middle of his chest when he was stopped by a protruding mound, covered by a thick fabric and what felt like a thin metal wire.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; he yelled with a surprisingly high pitched voice.  He looked down to see a tight-fitting silk shirt clinging to a pair of C-cup breasts.  Mark ran his hand between his legs, hoping to disprove his suspicions.  The seam of his tightly cut jeans ran way to close to his pelvis to hide a penis and he a somewhat familiar shivering sensation as he ran a set of petite fingers across what he assumed was his new vagina.  <br />
<br />
Panicked, Mark looked around and saw that he was sitting alone in a row of three seats at the very back of the plane.  Awkwardly, he forced himself to his feet and ran towards the nearby restroom.  He heard the plane stewardess calling for him to sit down until the plane landed but he didn&#39;t pay her any mind.  In the restroom mirror, he saw the reflection of a cute, early twenty-year-old Indian girl with jet-black hair that ran just behind her shoulders.  There was no way to tell for sure, but it looked like he was a little under five feet tall. He ran his fingers across his lips and pulled at the skin of his cheek.  His new skin wasn&#39;t exceptionally dark, but it was much darker than Mark&#39;s pale, freckle covered, Irish skin.  <br />
<br />
He was almost knocked to the ground by turbulence, but Mark fraught as hard as he could to maintain his balance and examine his new form.  He tried to pull his collar down to get a better look at his chest but his shirt fabric was too tight.  He rushed his tight-fitting, silk shirt over his head as fast as he could, slightly stumbling to pull it over his breasts.  It was subtle but in the restroom mirror he could see his breasts slightly shift up and down as the plane hit rough patches of air.  He made a short attempt to unlatch the plain white bra that held his new breasts in place but he changed his mind when he realized that the plane was just about to actually touch the ground.  <br />
<br />
He almost forgot to put his shirt back on before leaving the restroom but Mark managed to pull himself together and he did his best to silently make his way back to his seat.  <br />
<br />
This was going to be a very interesting week.</p>
