<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff Wayne sat down solemnly with tears in his eyes, he chatted with his best friend Mei Li, as he breathed heavily with anxiety and he blew his nose with much drama as she had to calm him down from what happened earlier.<br />
<br />
Adam was getting sick of him despite just getting married, Adam was acting all aggressive unlike his usual self, Adam! Jeff was distressed about his husband for the first time ever, but thankfully Mei Li knew how to calm him down.<br />
<br />
The two of them were literally soulmates after all, despite their preference for the same sex. They knew each other since high school and stuck together as besties, whenever one had drama- the other always knew what to say to calm them down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks a ton Evelyn....&quot; He smiled briefly, as it changes to a cheeky smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Only my partner gets to call me that! Hahaha!&quot; She laughed loudly, it was an inside joke only she, Jeff and her girlfriend knew. &quot;Don&#39;t make me treat you to my &#39;special cooking&#39; !&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t make me crash the stock market again gurl!&quot; Jeff sassily replied, with his finger wagging in the air.<br />
<br />
Hahahahaha! <br />
<br />
They ran the Catering business together, Jeff did the recipes and gave premium cooking lessons and trainings to the chefs while Evelyn did the administrative work, promotion and all the business details. <br />
<br />
If they did the other&#39;s job though, it would spell disaster. Thankfully they had each other to call whenever they faced a stressful issue about almost anything. She was his gf , Girlfriend in a gay sense of course. <br />
<br />
&quot;On my way in a bit, let&#39;s watch that yummy soap opera we always wanted!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yas Queen!!!&quot; He squealed as he hung up the call, deciding to go out to wait for her. He didn&#39;t have anything else to do anyway now that Adam is out.<br />
<br />
He was dressed in a plain white tee with pink sleeves and designs, wearing a pair of stylish khakis as he slipped on his gentle pair of sandals as he set off.<br />
<br />
His his blonde curls carried by the wind, blue eyes brimming with life as the lithe, short twinkish man stood out more than the average man could---!<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY DUDES!&quot; A loud and obnoxious voice sounded from the opposite side of the road. &quot;ITS A GIRLY BOY! AHAHAHA!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff turned around to that insult, it struck a nerve on him as he hated homophobic people more than anything. What&#39;s worse is that even though its such a turn off, he was still erect and in need of his husbands attention.<br />
<br />
Sighing to himself, as he walked across the road to the skater group yelling &quot;HEY!&quot; And &quot;HEYYYYYY!&quot; But with little response and respect, they simply continued to skate on the sidewalk and shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;FAG!&quot;<br />
&quot;GAY!&quot;<br />
&quot;HOMO!&quot;<br />
<br />
The homosexual was now furious at this point, energy converted to steam as he tried to continue shouting and flailing arms to no avail as the insults kept piling up, little does he know it only accelerates the heterosexual, homophobic process.<br />
<br />
Fag, gay, homo. Man he was tired and bummed out by the time the curse swarmed his mind, he needed to chill out for once and save up the energy for more important stuff like work.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know...that flip is kinda cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as the skaters heard the complement, they stopped in their tracks mid way, like it was unexpected, a shift in reality as they&#39;re beginning to question the person who they insulted seconds ago.<br />
<br />
Jeff who couldn&#39;t be bothered by sports, found himself praising the sick tricks and moves like he appreciated it, at least in a boyish way. Nodding to himself and smiling carefree for the first time in the last five minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...Fag.&quot; The skater leader seemed less certain of himself. &quot;What do you know about gnarly men stuff like this huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I used to be casted as those gnarly roles back in high school, WHOA DUDEEE!&quot; Imitating the skater somehow quite good and manly sounding too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Had to learn couple of months of skating, not to mention all the heavy stuff I had to lift helping out backstage really helped a bunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Strong shoulders, tough arms and ready palms, feeling them ROUGHEN with tons of stage and stunt and acting work he&#39;s done over the years underneath his unfitting baker&#39;s outfit, height increasing taller by the minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;School plays? But there are a bunch of girly guys back there!&quot; The skater leader teased.<br />
<br />
The same original insult, yet for some odd reason. He didn&#39;t feel bad about it, like the skater was on his side, like he&#39;s a cool guy, talking to younger cool guys.<br />
<br />
Besides, he shouldn&#39;t be a hypocrite, he was pretty sure he felt that way about them too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, those insults are so high school. Haha!&quot; He laughed with less malice, in fact, understanding. &quot;I mean, that&#39;s what me and my buddies call them back then.&quot; Jeff...said? <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean...!&quot; His eyes twitched a little, like a malfunctioning in the system briefly, correcting the memory inconsistency in it. &quot;Haha! I had a couple of them falling for me can you believe it? GROSS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ewwwww! Gross!&quot; The teens wrinkled in disgust in union, before laughing it off, giving the older male a sense of security and assurance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha yeah dude!&quot; Jeff smirked and tussled the skater young teen&#39;s hair, like he wasn&#39;t afraid of em, like he had their respect. &quot;Man were me and my cousins joking all about it during the summer break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was always such a big brotherly figure, was so relatable and had this aura that attracted everyone cool around him. Though he understood that of it does bring creeps too.<br />
<br />
But he knew how to handle then while remaining straight as an arrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun out there lil bro! Make sure you stay away from sissies though, you wouldn&#39;t want to catch....&quot; His body shuddered internally, before his mouth willing volunteered to join the homophobia with---<br />
<br />
&quot;The HOMO!&quot; He did it , he said it.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHHH! HAHAHAHA! YOU ARE AWESOME MR WAYNE!&quot; The skaters waved goodbye to the taller and more proud looking male.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they...know my name?&quot; He questioned internally, before care freely  shaking his head and shrugging off. He was always the popular one, with kids-teens-adults and etc, it wouldn&#39;t be a shock if everyone knew who Mr Wayne was.<br />
<br />
Sides, boys will be boys, and they are free to be as loud and rowdy as they want to be. &quot;I was a kiddo like them before!&quot; He said, as he confidently strides back to his home, on the beautiful path.<br />
<br />
Non-Subconsciously noticing the increasing changes in his surroundings, noticing a swing with roses crawling around it in place of a rainbow painted on plastic hedge, and it seemed to be bigger overall...with better taste for a couple.<br />
<br />
He stopped at the sidewalk, it saying &quot;Welcome Home&quot; as he smiled tiredly, yet he still he had energy in him. It was somewhat late, and its like he&#39;s gone for hours even though it was---<br />
<br />
His sandals styled themselves more stylishly, I mean, he had to look presentable for some reason, black sizable loafers. &quot;A professional man! Boy would Eve like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, feeling slightly confused. Wasn&#39;t Eve a lesbian? ...ugh, even that word made him feel sick despite not showing it, he had to tolerate them after all cause he was an overall nice guy.<br />
<br />
Though of course, with testosterone raging below, he needed to get rid of that pent-up frustration, he casually slipped out of his polished pair, noticing white dress socks covering his larger more masculine feet.<br />
<br />
Luckily he just knew the person who could give him the massage that he needs below, his---!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm? Flowers?&quot;<br />
<br />
A bouquet of flowers addressed &quot;To Wayne&#39;s precious Eve&quot; as he looked at it questionably, sure he liked Evelyn and all, but he was....huh? Thoughts and questions jumped about in his brain, but after he took a whiff of it, Intoxicating sweetness taking over his mind and blended well romantically.<br />
<br />
Shirt sleeves elongating, losing pansy pink as they matched plain white, with cufflinks and silver studs in place like he means business. With a confident manly persona like his, he is bound to get those customers coming back every-time.<br />
<br />
Although, there is always one person he&#39;d always get butterflies seeing. Standing behind that door is that person, and that made him sweat, a lot.<br />
<br />
His apron grew into a better material, as it shrunk in size. A row of buttons and a collar popping down from his businessmen like dress shirt, with a tie being styled on as the white apron turned lovely red. <br />
<br />
Adjusting the red tie nervously, feeling it TIGHTEN around his back as he felt those BROAD shoulders ready to carry that hetero desire for all eternity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heterosexual?!&quot;<br />
He felt alarmed, vision all filled with mist ad he heard loud boisterous laughter around him, easing him briefly and sending his mind back to that fateful day, while his body progressed forward. <br />
<br />
Smiling drunkily, like how bachelor&#39;s party went wild. All his solid high school and college bros congratulating him. &quot;You&#39;re a man after all!&quot;, they remarked, feeling your biceps SWELL tightly on the shirt of his as they gave him a large--<br />
<br />
PAT!<br />
&quot;GO GET HER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pec and abs pressing-STRAINING against the fabric of the dress shirt, growing decently cause he&#39;s a committed gym-goer. Feeling them curiously before he lost interest, body needing something else more.<br />
<br />
His pair of sturdy LONG legs stretchiiiing out, showing nicely like during those marathons he ran in back in school. &quot;Pretty sure you would&#39;ve impressed her even then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Her? But I&#39;m not het...though, she sure is hot now that I think about it...&quot; Jeff remarked, losing his grip on his mind as his body makes sure he feels otherwise. With a slight Age progression so he will agree to it.<br />
<br />
Feet squirming and wiggling uncomfortably due to the suggestions, chemicals in the brain rewiring thanks to the wafting sickening smell of the flowers, BUTT plumping out nice and HARD, well that&#39;s not the only thing that&#39;s---<br />
<br />
&quot;Who am I kidding, she&#39;s HOT!&quot; Mr Wayne bellowed loudly, like he didn&#39;t care no more.<br />
<br />
HARD! Skin colours brighten up to a nice yellowish tan, asian oriented as his dick STRAINNS Against his shorts. He was her type, he&#39;s gonna take that chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...I&#39;m coming for you...! MEI LI!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mei Li!&quot; He said loudly, opening the door to his home, surroundings shockingly still misty as he noticed her dressed in a frilly apron with a blouse and a mini skirt , finished cooking her dish as she turned around and walked towards him happily.<br />
<br />
Why was she here? And wait...doesn&#39;t she look different? He could see her cheeks plumping out even further, hair curling up blonde as she wore those light blue contacts that made her just so....<br />
<br />
&quot;She owns a catering business after all...so she HAS to be good hahaha!&quot; Jeff assumed and his hunch was right, he knew she would be inside, his body said so.<br />
<br />
Nothing stops a man from getting what he wants.<br />
<br />
His anxieties melted into excitement, dick pulsating away with goodness as he spoke in a genuine and charming tone, with abit of his signature awkward cuteness in his tone. With open arms, he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey ! I&#39;m home!&quot;<br />
<br />
The strain overwhelming, as his shorts drape down to black leather pants with a silver belt, new identification and stuff lumped into your pocket nearly finalises his new life, walking towards her genuinely amidst the light.<br />
<br />
Wedding bells chiming, and the crowd cheering. He re envisioned this day like never before, as he starred at the person in front of him, heart thumping as the former mist clears away to the beautiful lady dressed in a gown.<br />
<br />
It was his wedding day, Christian and holy music played in the bible background he remembered, meeting her in church brought her memories, along with other times she supported him in competitions in school. <br />
<br />
Being a jock, the high school heartthrob was neat and all, but his Girlfriend was the hottest. Mist clearing around him as they revealed a more homely looking room, filled pictures of his accomplishments, trophies, and photos of the both of them.<br />
<br />
He was aroused, mouth smirking up innocently yet devious, he was a guy after all, reminded of the manly times with your fellow brash classmates back in school. Feeling the testosterone and hetero hot energy burning within you. <br />
<br />
Though not a play boy, for the only girl is the one in front oh him. Cannot think of anyone else....adam? &quot;Adam? You mean MADAM! She not gonna be called by that once I&#39;m done with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its gonna be time, as his hair trims shortly but classically as it neatly spikes up black and cutely, face rearranging to a solid rectangle octogon-polygon as his eyes thin out as let himself get captivated by the hetero man within.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wayne...&quot;<br />
&quot;Eve...&quot;<br />
<br />
They clasped their fingers together, as their rings united and coated into that rose gold that they loved. He brushed the mist away, like it was an unwanted viel covering her gorgeous, sexy, and cute face.<br />
<br />
Feeling extreme heat and affection with one another and---<br />
<br />
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE!<br />
<br />
KISSSSSSSS <br />
PSSSSHHHHHH!<br />
<br />
Wayne Chen kissed his wife passionately like it was the first time he met her, releasing his former unsatisfied self permanently as his new manlier self took over for good.<br />
<br />
Both smiled genuinely and held each other lovingly, they were the power couple, been together for just 3 years but they shared a bond and a relationship that was everlasting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come hunny-bunch!&quot; The female asian blushed, as she went to the kitchen at lightning speed and brought out her signature dish, laying it on the table as her husband whiffed it enjoyably.<br />
<br />
The married man devoured his wife&#39;s famous lasagna and bread sticks like it was the best thing in the world. It&#39;s great he had a beautiful wife who was basically &quot;A Master Chef&quot;. <br />
<br />
He sucked at cooking, probably one of the only things he&#39;d ever be bad at. Good or at the very least decent , in almost everything back in high school and college. <br />
<br />
Being the popular guy, a friendly and masculine jock that everyone admired and though his handsome face does have its costs, attracting unwanted, uncomfortable sissy attention, its benefits definitely outweigh them. Charisma helps you go a long way.<br />
<br />
Being a young and successful businessman at the age of 23, an entrepreneur in charge of various brands including his Wife&#39;s Catering business, especially rocking in sports and wellness with sales going off the charts, though he couldn&#39;t have ever done it without the support and love from his dear wife.<br />
<br />
Wayne Chen kissed his wife passionately once more, pushing her down on the living room couch as both of them flushed with redness and attraction.<br />
<br />
He was masculine, charming and rich, everything a girl could ever want. But Eve was cute, bubbly while sometimes seductive.<br />
<br />
And that made Wayne the luckiest guy on the planet to be with her for the rest of their lives. Insides ready to burst out and in need of attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...Jie Fu~, how was your day?&quot; Eve smiled as sweet as a mountain, yet seductively speaking his Chinese name while planting a kiss on his cheek before. <br />
<br />
He returned it gently, stroking her long gorgeous black locks. Normally Wayne didn&#39;t liked being called his Asian name, but when his wife who he loved so dearly says it, it only makes him love her even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was perfect&quot; He smiled, giving her a tender embrace, his huge bulge ready to tackle her like a man. Both of them ready to bliss and climax out for their vacation.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as I have you~&quot;</p>
