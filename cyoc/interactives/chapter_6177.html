<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you sip the last of the sweet drink the gassie' burbs keep coming. Yet like the shiver one gets from the Winter's cold your body seems to feel chills even though the temp out is in the 80's.<br />
<br />
The burps continue to bubble forth and with each stranger feelings hit one after another. Your gut rumbles and churns, looking for a place to sit and get control is now the primary thing on the mind. A leafy encove with a park bench to sit out of the hot sun offers you safe haven till the stomac settle's down.<br />
<br />
A bloated feeling now has you wishing for something more to drink with the fond desires to quell the stuffy feelings. As you sit your head feel's stuffed with cotton. The bloating of your guts seems to be making shirt and pants extremely uncomfortable. Even the tennis shoes and socks feel tighter by the minute. Now you purse the area for a place, any place to be private and remove what seem's so tight.<br />
<br />
The thought's of a fun day in the Park seem now a lost hope. Feeling ever more uneasy you poke a hand down past the belt and to the insides of those tight shorts. The itchy feeling makes the need to scratch. Thighs and buttocks are the worst as your scratching goes from mild to urgent. A shiver makes you feel even worse as the itchie's work North to stomac and back.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a belch which comes from your toes rolls out of the gut and brings with it a moment of terror. &quot;Beeeellllllcch.........Haw !&quot;<br />
<br />
People passing by nearest to you look at the uncomfortable person who made a funny noise. A blushing feeling rolls over your face but doesn't totally leave. Now in the shade you still feel hotter and more itchy, it was then when the sound of tearing stopped all cares in their tracks.<br />
<br />
Looking down the tennies' just ripped the rubber toe part from the cloth. Your foot is growing inside the shoes and an urget need to peel the tight things off gives a struggle. Fingers feeling all so stiff grope at shoestings. Pulling and tugging the shoes come off as then your socks too.<br />
<br />
Now seeing why the feet burst your shoes, they look darker in color. Almost as if the blood flow had ceased and the feet were turning a blueish black color. Your toes are very stiff and the skin between each toes now covers all except the last didgets. The total foot looks longer but more narrow. You heel was round but now is indented and the tendons stick out on each side.<br />
<br />
A hardy and sleepy yawn rolls over you and with it a stretching of back and arms. Breathing in deeply as you stretch. It is almost like the bones in your spine click and snap. Arms, forearms seem to stretch out longer as the odd feeling of stiff fingers makes for an inspection of them too.<br />
<br />
Drawing your arms down out of the stretch you look close at hands. Like the feet, fingers are stiff, the same odd color runs up the hands, to wrists, and up futher yet into the skin on your arms. The true oddity is a fuzzy hair seemly sprouting as one watches. The brown and gray hairs sprout fast and arms are being covered in minutes as you look and question.<br />
<br />
Wondering what is going on with you the feeling of tightness in the jaw brings on the next yawn andd stretch. Another big breath in, arms, legs and feet strain out into a stretch which makes people walking by step out of the way. As the intake of air reaches max, you exhale. The strange sound you made breathing in as a Heeeeeeeeeee, now exhales in a odder' yet Haaaaaaaaww! Then like a hickup you breathe in a short breath and exhale quickly. The resulting sound rolls out of your mouth with a well noticed, &quot;HeeeHaaw!&quot;<br />
<br />
You can't believe the stupid sound which just fled your mouth. The crowds seem to parts as close on people stare at the odd fool sitting in the leafy encove.<br />
<br />
Shaking the head makes you long to lose the dull hearing and numb feeling which prevades the head. Blinking the eyes, a tired feeling now rolls over you and the thought of finding a cool place to curl up and take a nap seems so right. Almost ready to nod off where you sit the Rrripppppp, of a seam of the shirt covering your back brings on reality.<br />
<br />
Sitting up the bench below creaks from a strain. Reaching to touch the shirt and twist to look at what was undoubtedly just heard the stiffened hands make a dayview. Fingers are gone, and dark black gray glob of semihard gel has replaced the fingers altogether. The palms and wrists merged into a elongated new forearm. The normal forearm is heavy with muscle as shoulders too bulge with muscle now. <br />
<br />
Sweat pour from you as these all so strange changes are happening while you sit out of the Sun. A wiggle of those dark feet brings your attention to them again. Now the toes there have become the same glob of gel but bonking the toes on cement pavement they are hard. Some movement is left to just above the toes. Joints, bones look familiar yet very different. The feet are very long now and covered in the funny colored hair as on your arms. That narrow heel now has the look of a hock rather that a part of the human foot.<br />
<br />
Another stretch, a deep inhale and quick exhale produces that foolish sound but with a raggedness it didn't have before, &quot;Hereee..Haaaaaaw!&quot;<br />
<br />
A laugh from a passing child and his words spring terror as the mind realizes what is happening. &quot;Look Daddy see the silly Donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOOFS, you have hoofs instaed of hands, hoofs in place of toes! HAIR, almost a furry covering now runs up from the hoofs to shoulders, legs and places yet to be explored. The jaw feels so odd and my tongue rolls about feeling heavy slablike teeth. Something like rocks in the lips makes the tongue purse the mouth and I watch as the items fall out and to the ground. <br />
<br />
There on the ground I twist my head to view several silver nuggets and one golden nugget. &quot;DAMN, there fillings and my gold crown from that bad tooth the dentist fixed only last month.&quot; The thought as to coming tooth pains made me shudder. As then the tongue ran it's muscled self over, around, and between, finding no sharp edges, no holes, just solid hard teeth.<br />
<br />
To this point the total attention has been close up and to your own self. A look out into the passing crowds offers a limited view. The distance is blurry past 30 to 40 yards away. As you strain to see your mouth and lips feel odd and you wriggle the jaw, lips, and open to stretch away the feelings.<br />
<br />
Then too he dull feeling in the has gone and blurry sight is aided by an intense ability to hear. In fact hearing has increased so much that small sounds of people walking by one can hear their shoes making sounds on the walkways. The smells abound around you some sweet, some salty, and some a musky scent of the horses, mules, and donkeys which pass nearby.<br />
<br />
A deep breath in and the exhale out produces the odd but evermore familar sound which occasionaly comes from standing Coaches pulled by strong well formed donkeys. Indeed their scent is on the wind and when they pass or stand nearby you can't take your eyes off of them. A strange inner desire now pulses within the mind. The longing to get up a wander over, to be part of their lives, you relate somehow.<br />
<br />
The scents grow stronger as time marches on. Smells differ from male to female and it's the females which give off a perfume of alurment. As joints crack and muscles feel tight, hoofs are hard the aroused feeling perks you up in the creaking bench.<br />
<br />
More tares of cloth but you care little as sounds and scents fill the mind. Strange desires, almost a demanding lust for the company of those nice donkeys makes you wiggle as you sit. Ouch a pain in the rump makes you wriggle for a more comfortable position. It is now that the weather aged bench gives it's last and cracks in the middle. <br />
<br />
As your comfortable shaded seat gives way you scramble to stand. A wild scramble to stand, gain balance and not look like a fool.<br />
<br />
There, your up but feeling all so strange. Your head is up and looking about as people point and laugh. Odd but hands touch the concrete as do toes. When standing in the past your back was upright but now is horizontal. A nervous feeling of all this odd and strange goings on bring the new thoughts, and fears.</p>
