<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A CG animation of a slot machine whirring played on-screen. Gloria watched excitedly as it wound down before the results flashed.<br />
<br />
HUSBAND: Rose<br />
WIFE: Kevin<br />
<br />
Lesily was beaming. “Excellent choice! Rose dear, can you hear me?” She held her crystal up to Rose’s face.<br />
<br />
“Yes Lesily”, said Rose in monotone, staring ahead.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to have to ask you to undress. Don’t worry, we’ll find you better clothes”.<br />
<br />
“Alright”, said Rose, pushing the straps of her dress off her shoulders and shimmying out of her dress. Below it she was wearing a plain white bra and panties. She took those off mechanically, tossing them aside, and kicking away her shoes and socks along with her puddled dress.<br />
<br />
Underneath her clothes Rose looked about like what a 41-year-old housewife would be expected to look like. She was chubby and out of shape from having had three children, but she was still quite attractive, with heavy, sagging breasts and a large rear. Her low-hanging potbelly had a visible C-section scar. She was unshaved, her thick bush as red as her hair. She stood naked on stage, her expression blank, awaiting further instructions.<br />
<br />
“Thank you very much, Rose”, said Lesily encouragingly. “Now listen to me very carefully”.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Lesily”.<br />
<br />
“You are unrelated to Kevin here, and unrelated to Dave, Jessica, and Terri and anyone else on stage. When I give the signal, you are going to transform into the man you would be now had you been born male, and then you&#39;ll await further instructions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll await further instructions,&quot; repeated Rose hypnotically.<br />
<br />
“And… go”. Lesily snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
Rose stiffened, as though she had been shocked. Then she tensed up, clenching her fists, before stretching… and stretching, and stretching, shooting up rapidly in height. From 5’6’’, just seven inches taller than Kevin’s 4’11’’, Rose stretched even higher than her son and surpassed him to become a lanky 6’5&quot;.<br />
<br />
She looked like a beanpole momentarily before the rest of her body started to catch up. First, her hands, then her feet cracked and bulged as they expanded into larger, masculine sizes--transforming into large masculine feet and clumsy &quot;paws&quot; for hands with thick fingers. Her arms and legs in turn swelled and thickened as years of working out became apparent.<br />
<br />
Rose’s breasts deflated, the nipples and areolas shrinking as they rose up and turned into somewhat flabby pecs, while her shoulders cracked audibly as they widened, becoming broad and powerful. Her hips on the other hand crunched inwards, becoming narrow and masculine. The fat in her hips, thighs, and ass migrated to her belly, giving her a prominent beer gut. The C-section scar faded away and vanished as wispy red hair spread over Rose’s stocky body. She wasn’t very hairy as a man either, with the exception of her crotch and armpits.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh…” Despite being under hypnosis, Rose couldn’t help but moan - her voice breaking and becoming a deep baritone as her jawline grew more angular, squared off, and her features more rugged. Red stubble appeared on her cheeks and chin. Her long red hair shrank back into her head, eventually shrinking into a faded buzz cut.<br />
<br />
“Oh… oh… oh my, oh yes…” It was strange hearing Rose moan femininely in such a masculine voice… but surely there was one more change to come? She was holding her stomach, standing with her legs apart as her uterus and vagina inverted and her ovaries slid downwards. First her labia hung lower as her vagina sealed shut. The labia slowly morphing into her new scrotum and then one ovary followed by the other plopped out of her abdomen into a newly-developed scrotum. She rubbed her crotch, moaning and whimpering. Rubbed at first, then as her clitoris started to grow and length she held it. First between two fingers, then with her whole hand as it grew and engorged, becoming a full-fledged penis. Quite a big one too. He continued to jerk it until at last Rose climaxed with a gasp as a fully-formed man.<br />
<br />
“That was lovely, thank you”, said Lesily as Rose panted. His softening cock was still dripping. “Mind telling us about yourself?”<br />
<br />
“My name is Ross. I used to compete in amateur body building competitions, but haven&#39;t had as much time with my day job taking up most of my time,” he said, still a bit breathless. He had a stocky “dad bod”, but still looked like he used to work out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Ross, is there a special someone in your life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There used to be?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you asking, interested?&quot; asked Ross with a cockiness of a man half his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for myself, but there&#39;s this young woman I&#39;d like to introduce you to. Now, you just wait right here while I go get her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily then approached Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin, can you hear me?” She held her crystal up to Kevin’s face.<br />
<br />
“Yes Lesily”, said Kevin in monotone, staring ahead.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to have to ask you to undress. Don’t worry, we’ll find you better clothes”.<br />
<br />
“Alright”, said Kevin, stripping off his t-shirt and shucking his jeans and shoes rather quickly. Below it she was wearing a plain pair of white &quot;tighty whighty&quot; underpants. He took those off mechanically, tossing them aside, and kicking away his shoes and socks along with the pile of clothes.<br />
<br />
Underneath his clothes Kevin looked about like what a 12-year-old boy would be expected to look like. He was thinning out with only a tiny bit of &quot;baby fat&quot; left. His penis and balls looked to have yet to have really matured, with his balls seemling half-way descended from the sockets they were stored in until puberty. He had a few hairs around his tiny penis, just enough to say he had some, but otherwise was rather underdeveloped, thin, and childish. He stood naked on stage, his expression blank, awaiting further instructions.<br />
<br />
“Thank you very much, Kevin”, said Lesily encouragingly. “Now listen to me very carefully”.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Lesily”.<br />
<br />
“You are unrelated to Ross here, and unrelated to Dave, Jessica, and Terri and anyone else on stage. When I give the signal, you are going to transform into the girl you would be now had you been born female, and after that you will grow older until I say stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will grow older until you say stop,&quot; repeated Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, and go,&quot; said Lesily.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s transformation, due to his stage of development at first seemed far less noticeable. His half-way descended balls, pulled back up into their sockets and then fully into his abdomen, causing Kevin to clutch his stomach a bit as his insides rearranged. This left his scrotum to split and shift into his forming labia as a tiny hole opened and soon pushed further inward to Kevin&#39;s transforming insides, creating his vagina and cervix. All this occurred while his still underdeveloped penis shrank further, shifting from being a penis to a clitoris until it was enveloped into Kevin&#39;s developing folds. Beyond that Kevin&#39;s hair grew a little longer, her chest looked slightly puffy, and she grew maybe grew an inch or two taller, leaving Kevin as a girl who looked rather like her boy counterpart but a tiny bit further along puberty than her male self.<br />
<br />
That did not last long as Kevin let loose a moan, which deepened from a child&#39;s soprano to more of an alto as she shot up in height to 5&#39;9&quot;, losing all sense of baby fat, and her chest went from looking puffy to beginning to develop into breasts. Her body soon began to fill out as her hips began to grow wider along with the growth of her breasts. Her blonde hair grew even longer until it was half-way down her back. Rather soon a developing teenage girl was standing where a prepubescent boy had been a few minutes ago, and she was continuing to grow older as she left High School and her womanly curves became even more prominent, as well as the moans of ecstasy she felt as she rubbed her fingers into her achingly wet groin.<br />
<br />
About the point that Kevin looked more like she had passed being a college graduate did Lesily yell, &quot;stop&quot;, and Kevin erupted in pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well, and would you mind introducing yourself to us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin collected herself and in a sultry tone introduced herself, &quot;Hi, my name is Keeva, and I&#39;m a gymnast. Went to the Olympics when I was younger, earned a Bronze medal for my floor routine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice, Keeva. I have someone that I&#39;d like to introduce you to, his name is Ross.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately Gloria could see that Ross was attracted to Keeva--if his erection was any sign of his feelings. However he seemed to be a tad bit awkward around Keeva as they talked briefly. It was noticeable enough that Lesily paused the conversation, put the twenty-two year old Keeva back into her trance, and pulled Ross aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ross, buddy, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t tell me that you&#39;d be introducing me to Keeva Smythe, an Olympic medalist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about it, she&#39;s a trainer at her gym now for younger gymnasts, I thought with your background as a gym rat you two would have loads to talk about,&quot; said Lesily as though she had actually been his wing-woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe in my younger days, sure, but with this Dad-bod I&#39;ve got going on, she&#39;d never take a guy like me seriously,&quot; admitted Ross.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Ross, feeling a little inadequate? You shouldn&#39;t--you&#39;ve got a whole lot going for you--at any age. But, if you&#39;d like, I could pull a few strings and get your youth back for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ross immediately lit up, &quot;You could?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Remember that I have access to that magical hypnotic stage I always talk about? I could use it on you to shave a decade or two off your age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-could you also shift my interests a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; asked Lesily, curious as to where this would go.<br />
<br />
Ross explained, saying, &quot;Ya see, Keeva&#39;s all big into gymnastics, and when I was young... well I was a meathead looking to just pump iron, drink protein, and get swoll. I&#39;d like to still be a gym rat, but maybe make me a different kind of gym rat--one which Keeva would like to date--if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m getting what your putting down Ross--don&#39;t worry, I can shift your interests at the gym a little bit and it won&#39;t change how &quot;swoll&quot; you were all that much. After all a gym rat of a different stripe still squeaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily showed the crystal in front of Ross quickly and he went into his trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ross, when I snap my fingers you will grow younger until you reach your twenty-first birthday at which point you&#39;ll stop getting younger. As you get younger you&#39;ll start to remember more of the gymnastics you took part in as a kid and teenager, forgetting your body building craze and remembering only your obsession with competing in gymnastics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily snapped her fingers and the rugged &quot;dad-bod&quot; Ross seemed to shiver on stage. First thing that changed was his upper body became far more jacked up than it had been as gray hairs at his temples faded back to being red. As Ross retreated through his thirties his beer gut shrank and the definition of his long-buried abs slowly began to reappear. Lines on his face that made him looked rugged slowly smoothed themselves out of existence giving Ross a brighter and more energetic appearance.<br />
<br />
Returning back to his twenties, Ross had completely lost his belly fat and his haircut changed from a faded buzz cut to a curly undercut fade that was far more popular with the younger guys he was becoming--which along with a confident smirk gave Ross the appearance of a cocky attitude. As he approached college age, Ross seemed to be bouncing with energy enough that he tumbled his body into a handstand to work out his bountiful energy. While Ross&#39; muscles became slightly more defined, he also lost a bit of bulk as he settled on having just turned twenty-one today--becoming a thinner but still jacked gymnast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Ross, Happy Birthday buddy, how&#39;s training going?&quot; asked Lesily her tone having shifted from that of a peer to more of a cool Aunt vibe.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s going great! I&#39;m headed to the Olympics this year for my routines on the rings and pommel horse. I made the team--unlike last time when I just barely missed it, this time I will crush the competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you have anyone special that you&#39;ve got your eye on for when you&#39;re not practicing?&quot; asked Lesily.<br />
<br />
Ross blushed, his cheeks becoming a shade of red that clashed with his hair, &quot;well, there&#39;s this girl who won at the last Olympics that&#39;s giving this games her last go... I&#39;d like it if it became something more, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re being bashful. A young buck like you, in the prime of his life--most men would kill to be in your shoes. I say go for it--what do you have to lose?&quot; asked Lesily as she then gently pushed Ross into Keeva, causing the two to interact--Ross clearly feeling more insecure now that he was the younger of the two, which Keeva cut right through by landing a kiss right on Ross&#39; lips. A kiss which Ross, thankfully didn&#39;t waste as he responded in kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, folks, it seems that Keeva and Ross are about to begin their life of wedded bliss--let&#39;s leave them to it and come back to them later. And now let&#39;s turn our attention to family number two.&quot;</p>
