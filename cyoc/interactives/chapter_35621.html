<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny stumbled and tottered her way to the door of what had always been her History class, but when she read the sign on the door it read ‘SOCIETAL DYNAMICS’. Jenny was puzzled; the curse had changed her classes? Societal Dynamics wasn’t a subject that she’d ever been taught before...<br />
<br />
She pushed open the door and was a little surprised to see that all of the desks had been moved into a semi-circle, with Mr. Richards’ desk facing all the others. There was no empty desk left so Jenny looked around, it wasn’t until she walked into the room further that she noticed a pile of cushions on the floor in the centre of the semi-circle.<br />
<br />
Mr Richards was one of Jenny’s favourite teachers, he was smart and funny and he always managed to make his lessons fun and interesting. He was in his late thirties and kept himself in reasonable shape, he nearly always removed his jacket and tie as soon as he entered the room and encouraged out of the ordinary teaching methods.<br />
<br />
Mr Richards smiled, “Ah, Jenny! Would you like to lie down and we’ll get started” Jenny gasped as she came and leant against the door frame, the name induced orgasms thing was really starting to get on her nerves. Everyone sat patiently for her to walk into the centre of the semi-circle and lie down on the cushions, they were organised in such a fashion that kept her legs slightly spread and her torso propped up facing the rest of the class. She left her bag to the side of the pile, she had a feeling she wouldn’t need it.<br />
<br />
“Now then, last week we discussed the differences in cultures and customs abroad, but this week I’d like to talk about the same things but much closer to home.” Mr Richards said from somewhere above and behind Jenny’s head. “Now Jenny here” He paused and allowed a gap in his speech for Jenny to gasp and moan again. “Isn’t the same as anyone else, she has a unique ‘culture’ which makes her very special. Jenny...” (He paused again until the whimpering subsided.) <br />
Jenny couldn’t believe she was the topic for this class! “...was born what we in the western world call a slut.”<br />
<br />
Jenny was shocked; he’d just called her a slut in front of everyone in the class! And they’d all smiled and nodded in confirmation! Why wasn’t she saying something?! Why did it all sound so true...? <br />
<br />
Above her Mr. Richards continued,<br />
<br />
“You see, she was born with a perpetually wet pussy and milk producing breasts. In fact her greatest adaptation to a life of simple sexual pleasure is that she needs orgasms like we need food.” Jenny felt so low; she was being treated like a scientific case study. “But to cope with this life she also doesn’t wear clothing; unlike the rest of us, and she requires constant sexual teasing.” <br />
<br />
Inside her head Jenny was screaming that nothing he was saying was true, but her body seemed to be involuntarily passive. She felt herself smiling and nodding in confirmation to all the statements being said about her. “For example she would have no objection to masturbating right now, would you Jenny?”<br />
<br />
Jenny let out a muffled cry of “mmhmm” as she came, before she found herself rubbing her soaking pussy violently in front of everyone in the room. She couldn’t stop herself! Her hand was becoming slicker and slicker with her juices and the pillows beneath her were absorbing huge quantities of her fluids.<br />
<br />
She looked up through blurry eyes at the faces of her classmates, they were all watching her get herself off and it was being encouraged by her teacher! She could feel herself getting closer and closer to the edge until she reached her screaming climax. She lay back on the pillows she felt bloated the massive orgasm. “Following an orgasm like that she’ll probably be feeling how the rest of us would feel following a big meal. The only way for her to be relieved of that bloated and over fed sensation is for her to be milked.”<br />
<br />
Now that he’d mentioned it Jenny knew that she needed to be milked, she felt so full; it was like needing to use the bathroom but in her nipples “No-one quite knows how she does it but Jenny *she quietly came as he continued* manages to turn the energy she gets from orgasms into food and then once digested this is turned into milk.”<br />
Jenny looked up at all the faces of her class mates and friends that were looking down at her. Her wet pussy had now soaked all of the pillows and she could feel the dampness creeping further down to her toes. Suddenly she saw two suction cups being attached to her nipples by Mr Richards, attached to each was a tube which Jenny followed with her eyes. They led straight into a large metal tank that had a glass panel on the side with quantity readings on it.<br />
<br />
“I’d like everyone to get on with some of the questions in the Text book about alternate cultures and societies while I milk her.” Jenny looked up at him with pleading eyes, “You really need this don’t you” he whispered as he flicked the switch. Jenny gasped as the milk started pouring out of her, “I’m only going to take a little, we still need you for the lunch time coffee rush.” Mr Richards smiled and then moved away.<br />
<br />
Jenny lay there for the rest of the lesson and watched her classmates get on with their studies while she was slowly milked, the pleasuring waves from each nipple eventually brought her to a number of orgasms until Mr Richards turned off the machine and helped her up just before the bell went. When she turned to look at the tank she saw that there was at least 4 litres of milk in it and he said that that was only a little!<br />
<br />
She grabbed her bag and then tentatively walked back into the halls; it was first break so everyone was rushing to the cafeteria or the playing fields. It wasn’t until she got back into the coolness of the halls that she noticed how wet she was, her lubricants had slowly poured down both legs and the insides of her shoes were now slippery. As she walked she could fell more dampness pouring out of her. This problem was insane! She had to find some paper towels or something!<br />
<br />
She looked for Susan as she exited the room and tried to avoid her, she needed to dry herself!<br />
<br />
She walked as quickly as she could towards the nearest girl’s bathroom but before she could get inside she felt a hand on her shoulder...</p>
