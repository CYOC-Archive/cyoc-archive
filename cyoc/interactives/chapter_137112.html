<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bea struggled to figure out how to fix this when she looked back at her phone. If it was still working she could just take a photo of herself and hope she got back to being male, or at least turn her lesbian or bi... Though she wondered how the app decided those things, did she become someone who likes guys just because she snapped her boy self? Or was it random?<br />
<br />
She suddenly realized she was fiddling with the phone when she ended up thumbing over the memory slot. A thought came to her, maybe whatever app she was using could be transferred to a new phone, or jerry rigged to her web cam. With a bit of hope, she pulled out the memory card and fit it into a slot on her computer; downloading all the people turned porn she&#39;d taken first for safekeeping, and then rooting around in the apps for the photo program.<br />
<br />
She managed to find it and copy it to the computer, giving her a sigh of relief, and as a test, she tried to open the program in hopes it would run. She almost squealed with joy when it booted up, showing her in the webcam.<br />
<br />
As she clicked the button, she suddenly felt dizzy and so much smaller in her chair. As expected, she saw her 2nd version of herself in a new video, which a quick check of showed her pulling back her vest and letting the camera peer between her breasts. As she watched, she felt a tingle of wetness returning to her folds, letting her know she was very much still a girl, but at least she was attracted to &#39;herself&#39;.<br />
<br />
A quick look down showed her she wasn&#39;t as well endowed as her last self, with her body being covered by a black hoodie with a zipper, she would have looked flat if her hoodie was any looser, making her figure they must have been A-cups. Pulled down around her knees was a pair of bright blue hot pants, while a pair of pink panties was pushed to the side, with one of her hands absentmindedly rubbing the area around her vulva.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the photo-app, she saw own face, framed by short black hair, and across her face was a rectangular lensed pair of glasses she hadn&#39;t noticed, giving her the look of a cute nerd. A thought that made her giggle, as a stray thought made her think she&#39;d look even cuter with a pair of cat ears and a tail.<br />
<br />
She closed the app, and left the video of her last self looping on one side of the screen while flicked back to her porn file; there was certainly a lot more girls in there now, most of them having at least one, and at least half of those only had girls. But there was still a handful of boy on boy porn. She shrugged, realizing she must have been a little bisexual. What was a little more unusual was that most of it wasn&#39;t the videos and photos she had as Ben or as the last Bea, most were drawings, some of magical girls, some of them of animal people pushing their multiple pairs of tits against another girl&#39;s tits.<br />
<br />
She put the video of &#39;Bea&#39; into full screen again, watching as she put on a cam whore act for her own personal satisfaction. She rubbed harder, slowly sliding one delicate finger in, and her body tensed up, her legs feeling strained as she pushed herself, making her realize she her muscles still need to recover from her last orgasm. She slowed her pace, letting her slowly build up rather than racing through it.<br />
<br />
With her other hand, she brought up a couple of photos to put in the space to either side of the &#39;Bea&#39; that was on screen. On one side, putting up a drawing of the multi-boobed foxes, and on the other a couple of magical girls making out.<br />
<br />
Taking her hand away from the computer, she undid the zipper of her hoodie, and lifted her shirt up, exposing her bra-less cute little tits to the air and rubbing one of her nipples with her thumb as she palmed her whole breast in one hand.<br />
<br />
She gasped as her hand on her loins had both her middle finger and her ring finger inside herself, rubbing her clitoris against the palm of her hand. Even as her muscles tightened to fight her, she pushed deeper, making her feel the fluids being forced out of her before she finally felt the beginnings of an orgasm as pleasure shot up through her belly, and she felt her vagina milking her fingers for all they could; her tongue hanging out as her body strained past her limits.<br />
<br />
In the afterglow she figured it might be good to stay like this for a while. At the very least her new body looks cute for her to look at, and she&#39;s got a whole new porn collection to browse through.<br />
<br />
Glancing over at her phone, its screen appeared to still be a little cracked, but it only seemed to be the corner with the screen under it still functional, with a thick protective case surrounding most of the phone which must have protected it from the worst of the damage. Whoever she was now, she must have been a little more protective of her electronics. At the very least, this meant she wouldn&#39;t have to get a new phone to use the app on more people at school.<br />
<br />
As she looked down at herself she wondered if she&#39;d still be hanging out with the girls she hung out with as &#39;Bea&#39;, she didn&#39;t know if she still had that name, and for all she knew she might be shy or a loner, or maybe she hung out in the computer club... Who was she?<br />
<br />
… Thoughts ran through her head, wondering if there was a way to figure that out before tomorrow, or if she&#39;d have to wing it.</p>
