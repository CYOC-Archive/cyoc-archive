<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle was astonished at the speed those words came out of the taur train&#39;s muzzle. He was going to be the one casting another curse on her to turn her into his personal racing greyhound! How could this have possibly happened?<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot; If he was going to be subject to this humiliating role reversal, this should be better than her exploiting the dare to get him to reverse the curse altogether.<br />
<br />
Jennifer would not have even thought of lengthening her body if she hadn&#39;t begun to fall in love with her large body and wanted some children of her own that will inherit it. However, this body needs a lot of food to sustain, and without the guarantee of bags of dog kibble for her each meal, this will be difficult. Plus, she needs a larger space to move around, larger than her current tiny house.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will transform into a greyhound taur with only one lower body and mate with me immediately, with the resulting offspring being taur trains with the same length as my current body. Then, over there, across the road, there is the remains of an abolished shopping mall with an emptied swimming pool, an outdoors parking lot and a basement storage space with a pedestrian underpass to the greyhound stadium. That is the perfect spot, with electrical and water supplies already laid out. You will transform into a luxurious mansion with the same external dimensions as the five-storey shopping mall, including the basement. The interior will be subdivided into three storeys with a large central hall, eight bedrooms each with its own bathroom, two guesthouses, two kitchens, a garage with a lorry large enough to hold two mes inside, storage rooms lined with shelves and antiques, a video game room, a home theatre, and a dining room where you spontaneously manifest a large feast sufficient to feed fifty people whenever I enter the room alone. The outdoors pool and hot spring will be refilled and filtered daily. The underpass will remain as an emergency exit and floodgate but the exit will be sealed and locked from the inside. The parking lot will become a lush garden with many different plants of all shapes and sizes. The mansion will have ventilation, dessication and air-conditioning systems to ensure maximum comfort. Of course, the entire mansion and garden will be in my ownership, so all the facilities will be adapted to my and my pups&#39; lengthy body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylr felt two new canine legs grow from his midsection until they touched the floor, while a tail sprouted from hhis rump and fur grew all over his body. His mouth and nose extended into a muzzle, and his hind legs turned into digitigrade paws while his hands become paw-like, though with the fingers still separable. He stretched his arm backwards and Pat his lower torso, but not before the most pleasant scent of a bitch in heat entered his nose. He pried Jen&#39;s rump away from her head, pounced on it, and jammed his cock into it, releasing his seed into her insides.<br />
<br />
Kyle then walked through the underpass to the basement below the remains, then walked up a set of stairs to the middle of the piece of land, a few steps literally falling apart in the process. Once there, the changes began, starting from his back half sinking into the ground. He dangled his hind legs, as if they were in the air. Then he could feel an ache in his feet and his privates as they expanded to fill in the dug-up space, his flesh turning into thick concrete walls while the bones hollowed out into the interior of the rooms including the facilities and the blood vessels turned into pipes and electric wires. His left leg turned into a game room with a massive screen in front, multiple long saddle-like chairs, a billiards table, a toilet, and a mini-bar. His right leg turned into a storage room with antique couches, clocks, shelves lined with books, carpets, and the like. He had a sudden urge to pee as his bladder expanded and opened into the pool, the water filling it up. His cock thrusted in front of him into the underpass, then swelled to line the space with a very thick wall, ending in a thick door. His kidneys enlarged into the filtration system for the pool. His anus connected all the pipes to the sewage system. His tail hollowed out into a carpeted staircase to these facilities, again sealed by a thick door. This space then could double as a bunker for disasters.<br />
<br />
Above ground, he could still more his forelegs, arms and head. But not for long. His left foreleg stretched into the parking lot and flattened across the entire lot. Green grass grew all over it, along with plants of all varieties. The blood vessels within the hand turned into an automatic sprinkling system for the garden. The fingers spoke into a long fence around the garden, isolating it from the fields beside the mansion. A concrete trail went through the garden, ending at the fence where a large gate allowed vehicular access. The right foreleg magnified into a massive garage able to hold a lorry and with basic tools inside. The paw stretched into a massive lorry with a connection between the driver&#39;s seat and the storage compartment so that Jen could cram her and her pups&#39; lower bodies there. The fingers become the gates.<br />
<br />
And that was only the beginning. His entire upper body swiftly aggrandised to fill in the remainder of the land. He waved his giant arms in the air, but soon they were locked straight up into chimneys, hollowing out with fireplaces at the bottom. His torso was made into a square shape exteriorly, with a Gothic style overall. The intestines were turned into the pipes and cables inside the walls, the heart into a water heater, the lungs and airways into the air conditioning and filtering system, and the liver, spleen and stomach into kitchens. With the entire peritoneal space hollowed out, the rooms of Jennifer&#39;s desire can be formed. The upper floors formed with a humongous master bedroom with an extremely long bed and a giant television with a gaming consoles, and seven smaller replicas of this bedroom. Each one had a specially designed bathroom with a squat toilet at one end of the entrance, and a set of circular brushes as found in a carwash, shower heads, fountains on the floor and soap dispensers along a short corridor, followed by air blowers from every wall and an exit. The taur train can walk through the corridor, and for each lower torso being washed the one in front is being dried. Once the entire train passed through, the hindmost torso can pee and poop into the squat toilet. A massive dining room had a long table with throne-like chairs with holes for the lower torsos to pass through while the front torso and legs sat like a normal person. Two guest bedrooms formed too, but merely at one quarter the size of the bedrooms intended for her pups. A home theatre formed with a large screen, several loudspeakers, a massive couch with a hole for the lower body to pass through, a drink dispenser and a corn popper. <br />
<br />
His head remained unchanged until now, with a still hollow space in the middle of the house. His mouth opened agape and a massive set of doors guarded its end. The tongue turned into a large red carpet as the nose became air vents for the kitchen and ventilation system. His teeth turned into windows lining the wall with decorative torches in-between them. His cranial space turned into an attic with his eyes becoming protruding dormers out of the roof with windows. His ears became satellite dishes. He tried to talk, but no sound was made, meaning he couldn&#39;t get revenge on Jennifer anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magnificent.&quot; Jennifer gasped. She opened the gate and the doors to the mansion. As she had never had anything to eat that day, she immediately headed to the dining room where she was met with a sumptuous feast of roast chicken and pork across the  entire table. She let her instincts take over and devoured all the meat on the plates, and only until the very last one did she feel satiated.</p>
