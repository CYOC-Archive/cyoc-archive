<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James hadn&#39;t slept much that night. He had drifted off with his mother in the room, but had woken in the middle of the night. On unsure hooved legs, and a naked lower half, he had made his way back to the bedroom him and Jess were to share. Her absence did confuse him, though he was happy to be able to sneak in and under the covers. Sleep from then on was fitful as the acts of the past day played on his mind. Two changes in one day. Both from blowjobs. One from his own mother, and one from a rutting donkey. <br />
<br />
The worst part was, that every time he closed his eyes, he could still see the plump ass and black pussy of the donkey, winking at him, trying to tease him. It made him ill, and it made him think of Melissa, which made him even more unsettled.<br />
<br />
By the time the door opened to let Jess back into the room, near dawn, he was ready to jump out of the bed and abandon sleep altogether. As the door opened and she entered, he whipped around on the bed, blankets following, and sat upright.<br />
<br />
Jess spun in surprise, turning on the light to see her brother sitting up in the bed, feet on the ground.<br />
<br />
Not feet. Hooves.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s eyes bulged, and she pointed at them. James, closed his eyes, then pinching the bridge of his nose in shame and tiredness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, um. Mom explained that she&#39;d hurt her leg too, and that changing them would work to fix it.&quot; He sighed. Jess&#39;s eyes went wide, their mother was now coercing James to change too. This was bad. She had to warn him. She opened her mouth to voice a warning, and then she stopped. She had promised her dad that if he couldn&#39;t speak, she wouldn&#39;t either.<br />
<br />
This now posed a dilemma; she could speak with him not around, and he would never know; and she would be a hypocrite and a liar. Or she could hold up her promise, and keep her voice to herself.<br />
<br />
She paused, concerned expression on her face long enough for James to prompt. &quot;Jess?&quot;<br />
<br />
She snapped back, her gut roared at her to keep to her word, so she did. Instead of voicing concern, Jess shook her head wildly, and began looking around the room. On the vanity, she found a notepad and pencil. <br />
<br />
Quickly she scrawled.<br />
<br />
&#39;This place is doing something to mom. She&#39;s not herself, I think she&#39;s trying to get others to change more. She&#39;s been trying to get dad to say an animal&#39;s name all evening.&#39; James took the paper, eyes flicking over the contents and brows furrowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Jess... What is this? And what&#39;s with the silent treatment?&quot; He asked, dubious. &quot;Can you only Moo now or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess shot him a look that could have killed. She snatched the paper back and began scribbling again, quickly stuffing the paper back at him.<br />
<br />
&#39;Of course not you fucking twit. I promised Dad I wouldn&#39;t speak as long as he couldn&#39;t. In solidarity.&#39; James put the paper down, &quot;You&#39;re a weird person Jess.&#39;. Jess nostrils flared in anger and she spun. James saw that he hit a nerve and as he did, something clicked in him. Ever since they had gotten here, Jess had been warning them, trying to help everyone. She&#39;d even saved and dragged him back after his foolish escape attempt. She deserved a bit better than shitty attitude from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Jess...&quot; He called. She paused. &quot;I. I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to be mean. I&#39;m just a bit on edge from the last few days.&quot;. Jess turned, eyes softer and she nodded. James sighed, &quot;What&#39;s this about Mom then?&quot; He asked again.<br />
<br />
Jess nodded and picked up the notepad and sat beside him, scribbling away.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
As Jess stood under the soothing blast of a hot shower the next morning, she thought back to the night before. The time relaying her fears of what the Cabin was doing to Joan, to her brother. How, finally, someone had listened to her. James had promised to keep an eye out, making sure that Joan didn&#39;t try to goad Henry into saying an animal&#39;s name. That much James had been readily willing to agree to.<br />
<br />
She also remembered her time with their father. The thought made her nipples tingle, stomach turn with butterflies and pussy burn.<br />
<br />
With a sigh she put her hand on the tap, and flicked it to cold. She winced as a cold blast now assaulted her and bounced off her ample chest, driving any sexual thoughts from her mind. She would not let this place best her. Not like their mother. She would go downstairs, and read through every book in this place. Perhaps more were journals, perhaps some were histories. Maybe, one of them was their ticket out of here.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
In the bedroom, as his sister showered, James was tearing through the room&#39;s wardrobes. Jeans were no longer a choice for him to wear, so he was pulling out every baggy tracksuit pants to find on he liked. So far he hadn&#39;t settled on one that suited, not that any would hide his huge package. He had settled on a plan tough. Not deterred by previous failure, he decided that the best course of action was to keep trying to find a way out. If Jess was going to be the brains and research, he would be the brawns and explore the environs. <br />
<br />
James took a step from the wardrobe to the bed, and promptly fell over his hooved feet. <br />
<br />
Well, explore as soon as he got used to these new feet perhaps.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Joan was humming a toneless tune to herself as she set up a canvas on an easel. Picking up a piece of charcoal she quickly sketched a few lines and circles as outlines for the rest of the piece. It would be a full body portrait she had decided. One of herself.<br />
<br />
She giggled and she looked over the the full length mirror across from her and the easel. Picking up the hem of her skirt she lifted, showing off her package and hanging crotch-tits. <br />
<br />
Nude art was always best.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Henry, at this time was in the kitchen, cooking breakfast a thousand thoughts racing through his head. Jess, the night before. Joan, what she had tried to do. James, his outbursts and rage. How was he going to hold this family together here. Especially if he couldn&#39;t talk...</p>
