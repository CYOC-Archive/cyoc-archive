<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A second after Jeff ended his train of thought, he hears the door to his room open and the voice of his 10-year-old brother Tj, “Jeff, you there?”<br />
<br />
Tj looks like the younger version of Jeff, both have short black hair, brown eyes and an athletic body due to their sports activities.<br />
<br />
Hearing the voice of his little brother causes Jeff to panic, ‘no! Why is he here?! He was supposed to be at his friend’s! What… what if he finds me? What if he notices the program? What will he do to me?!’<br />
<br />
Tj steps into the room and looks around, “guess he’s not here,” the boy mutters, “damn it! And I wanted to ask if he’d want to play some soccer! Man… that would have helped me calm down after the argument with Ben!”<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old is about to leave when his eyes land on Jeff’s Laptop, Tj raises an eyebrow and tilts his head, “weird, usually Jeff turns off his Laptop when he’s not at home. So why is it on,” he asks himself, walking up to the Laptop, “and what is that weird looking game on the screen? And WHY is there an Acorn lying on his chair?”<br />
<br />
Jeff panics when he feels his brother pick him up, he then mentally gulps when the giant face of Tj comes into view, ‘shit… he’s a giant! Damn… I forgot how tiny Acorns are!’<br />
<br />
Tj shrugs and puts the Acorn on the desk next to the Laptop before sitting down, “Jeff won’t mind if I play a game,” the boy says to himself, “at least it’ll calm me down. I wonder what type of game he is currently playing”.<br />
<br />
‘Nononono! If he finds out… there is no telling of what he’ll do,’ Jeff thinks to himself, feeling his panic increasing.<br />
<br />
Tj finds the manual and opens it, then he reads and his expression grows more and more confused, “really? A game that is able to transform anyone and anything into various things? Yeah right,” he mutters, shaking his head in disbelief. The boy closes the manual and scans the various tabs, he then notices a tab that says, “transformation history” with a small “1”. Tj’s curiosity gets the better of him and he opens the tab, his eyes widen at what he reads: “Transformation one: subject Jeff Davis to Acorn!”<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old stares at the tiny Acorn in disbelief, “what the… no! It CAN’T be,” he mumbles, “but… it kinda MAKES sense: Jeff’s Laptop is on, Jeff is not here and I find this Acorn lying on his seat! What if it is true? I… I got to know for sure, but how?”<br />
<br />
Tj closes the history and scans the tabs, “there has to be a way,” he mumbles, “wait… what’s this? “Communication with transformed subjects”? It looks like a chat… “invite subject to chat”… selecting “Jeff Davis”… aaaand… okay, looks like he’s connected, his name is green like mine. I have two options, I could type into the chat and Jeff would hear my “voice” in his mind, or I could talk normally… hm… let’s try the latter”.<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old looks at the Acorn, “J-Jeff… c-can you hear me,” he cautiously asks, “is… is it true that you are the… Acorn lying on the desk?”<br />
<br />
Jeff at first feels a weird mental tingle, but somehow he can sense that he is now able to communicate with Tj, when Tj asks the question, Jeff mentally replies, ‘y-yes… I can hear you, Tj! And, yes… it’s true,’ Jeff has a good view of Tj so when he notices the boy’s eyes widen in shock and his mouth hang open, he lets out a mental sigh of relief, knowing that Tj is able to see what he had just mentally answered.<br />
<br />
“No freaking way,” Tj mumbles, “but seriously, bro: an Acorn?! Why?”<br />
<br />
“I… honestly don’t know,” comes the reply, “it… I don’t know… it felt right in the moment!”<br />
<br />
Tj shakes his head, “really, bro,” he says, “you can call yourself lucky that I am so curious! I could have thrown you away! Or what if some animal would have found you?”<br />
<br />
“Um…,” is all Jeff is able to reply.<br />
<br />
Tj rolls his eyes, “this is to weird,” he says, “so, where did you get this… game?”<br />
<br />
“I got it in the mail,” Jeff answers, “I… was sceptical and didn’t really believe any of what it claimed… but I guess I was wrong”.<br />
<br />
Tj snorts, “well, duh,” he says, he then picks the “Acorn” up and smirks, “you are so tiny and helpless, I could do anything with you”.<br />
<br />
Jeff panics, “pl-please, Tj,” he “says”, “please… I… I’ll do anything!”<br />
<br />
Tj raises an eyebrow, “anything? Really?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!”<br />
<br />
Tj grins, “okay, then I want you to promise: once you transform back that I get to decide your next transformation!”<br />
<br />
“Like… what?”<br />
<br />
Tj shrugs, “dunno yet,” he says, “maybe I’ll decide to transform the both of us, I am kind of curious and there are some things that I’d like to try, maybe finally I can become a Dragon-boy!”<br />
<br />
“You’d look scary,” Jeff replies.<br />
<br />
Tj grins, “maybe… but I’d look so cool and I’d have an awesome prehensile and strong tail!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is silent for a while, “actually, it could be fun,” he says, “having someone to test the program out with is safer than doing it alone. If something should go wrong the other will be able to stop the change”.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Tj says, “so, is it a deal?”<br />
<br />
“IF you promise to keep all of this a secret,” Jeff replies, “I want that just the two of us know about this… at least for now!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, sure,” Tj says, “I promise,” he then gets to his feet and carries the “Acorn” over to Jeff’s bed lying his transformed brother on it, “better have you transform back on your bed, before you damage you Laptop!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” is Jeff’s reply when Tj looks at the “chat”, “but… there is something you’d need to know!”<br />
<br />
“Oh? And what’s that,” Tj asks.<br />
<br />
“Um… when I transform back,” Jeff says, “I… I’ll be naked!”<br />
<br />
Tj snorts, then grins, “so? It’s not like I haven’t seen a cock before,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Bu-but… you are my little brother! I don’t want you to see me naked! It… it’s just wrong!”<br />
<br />
Tj grins, “I have the feeling that we’ll be seeing each other naked a lot,” he says, “it’ll be our little secret just like this “game” is our little secret!”<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally sighs, he knows that Tj is right, “okay… I guess it’ll be that way”.<br />
<br />
Tj grins, “I can’t wait to try this “game” out with you, big brother,” he says, “it’ll be fun! I know it will!”<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t help but mentally chuckle at Tj’s excitement, “I’m sure it will be,” he says, “Tj, could you tell me how long until I change back? If you open my file, there should be a timer counting down”.<br />
<br />
“Hang on, let me check,” Tj says, he opens Jeff’s file and finds the timer, “five minutes and counting,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, thanks,” Jeff replies.<br />
<br />
“You know,” Tj says, “since you’ll transform back soon and since you’ll be naked, maybe it’ll just be fair if I too would be naked!”<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally blushes, “um… you d-don’t have to,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tj chuckles, “aaaw… does someone feel embarrassed of seeing me nakey,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“N-nooooo?”<br />
<br />
Tj grins, “hehe… oh, come on,” he says, “either I’ll strip now or when I transform. Eitherway you WILL see me naked and I WILL see YOU naked!”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Jeff replies in defeat, grinning Tj wastes no time in stripping out of his clothes.<br />
<br />
“Besides,” Tj says as he throws his shirt to the side and moves to undo his pants, “I prefer being naked! Clothes are sooooo uncomfortable!”<br />
<br />
“You sure are one weird boy, Tj,” Jeff says in the chat.<br />
<br />
Tj, now naked, smirks, “look who’s talking,” he says, “I am not the one transformed into an Acorn!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay,” Jeff says, “we are BOTH weirdos!”<br />
<br />
Tj grins, “I can live with that,” he says, “since you’ll be back to normal any second, I’ll close the chat”.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff replies and Tj closes the chat, Jeff feels the mental disconnection.<br />
<br />
‘At least I know there is a way to communicate with someone, even when I am unable to speak,’ the teen thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Tj meanwhile is reading through Jeff’s stats, smirking at his brother’s desires and dark secrets, ‘I didn’t know Jeff was submissive, I could work with that,’ the 10-year-old thinks to himself, ‘one of his “curiosities” is wanting to know what it’ll be like as a girl… hehe… that gives me some fun ideas. He also would like to know what it’ll be like being a dog or some other animal. Hehe… oh, I’ll have so much fun with him!’<br />
<br />
The 10-year-old then decides to scan himself, after scanning himself, he opens his file and his eyes widen, then he grins, ‘according to this I am pretty dominant, but that makes sense, I like ordering my friends around and they do anything I say,’ he thinks to himself, ‘hehe… I can’t wait to transform into one of my desires, I think I’ll transform into a Dragon-boy first, but we’ll see. Maybe I’ll transform myself and Jeff at the same time, hehe… keeping Jeff’s transformation a secret from him! I’d like to surprise him with something!’</p>
