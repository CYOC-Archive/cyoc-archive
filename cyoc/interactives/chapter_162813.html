<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff would later admit that he hadn&#39;t thought things through, that he was mostly thinking with his &#39;little head&#39;. But right now, all he could think about was how unbelievably sexy Caaliyah was. Yes, he had created her to make his dad happy, but he never expected her to be more than an alter ego for him to be for part of the day. Finding out that she just got pregnant scared Jeff into making Caaliyah a separate person. But now his ideal version of an African-American woman was now his stepmom and Jeff just couldn&#39;t live with the tantalization.<br />
<br />
Jeff rushed back to his room and went to his computer. He quickly pulled up the Chronivac program and went to his profile. He quickly made some alterations to it. A lot of things he skimmed over and some boxes that he didn&#39;t check, but here were the changes he knowingly made:<br />
<br />
Name: Jeff Kendrick<br />
Age: 43<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
IQ: 110<br />
Language: English<br />
Sex Drive: Medium<br />
Build: Lean Athletic<br />
Hair: Short/Black<br />
Eyes: Light Blue<br />
Occupation: Businessman<br />
Love Interest: Caaliyah (wife)<br />
<br />
Jeff hadn&#39;t even stopped to consider how the changes would affect the rest of the family. He was in too much of a hurry to sate his own urges. He felt justified in what he was doing. After all, Caaliyah was his creation. If anyone should have her for a wife, it should be him. He could always make his dad another wife if he had to, but Caaliyah was his. With that running through his head, he clicked &#39;Start Transformation&#39;.<br />
<br />
Unlike with Caaliyah, there was no timer for Jeff&#39;s transformation. He immediately felt himself growing. His clothes grew with him, changing style to match his new age. He quickly surged through the remainder of his puberty. Jeff reveled in the feeling of getting bigger and stronger. His cock also grew larger, making Jeff more eager than before to have Caaliyah. As he went through his college years, Jeff&#39;s testosterone rang in his ears, urging him to find Caaliyah and get busy. He stood up from his chair and walked out of his bedroom when his body hit 30. His raging hormones had become tempered with maturity, even if he still felt a strong pull towards Caaliyah. A full beard began covering his face to show his newfound maturity.<br />
<br />
Jeff was instinctively drawn to the bedroom where he had spent the previous night as Caaliyah. It looked like she was straightening up in there. Jeff smiled as he walked in, seeing his wife clean. He felt a little tired as he entered his 40&#39;s. His hairline had went back about a half-inch and his lean physique sagged a little. But Caaliyah was no longer in her youth as well, but he still loved her. And he still had enough of a sex drive to want her.<br />
<br />
Caaliyah turned to smile at him. &quot;Good morning, gacaliye,&quot; she said, &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time to head for work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have the day off,&quot; said Jeff, not sure or caring if it was true or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you,&quot; said Caaliyah, &quot;What do you want to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can think of one thing,&quot; said Jeff before closing the distance. He wrapped his arms around his Somali wife as he kissed her deeply. Caaliyah was quick to respond in kind. Jeff&#39;s hands soon started groping Caaliyah&#39;s body, particularly her phat ass. He was also grinding at her quite a bit through their pants.<br />
<br />
Caaliyah pulled away and said, &quot;You&#39;re friskier than usual today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve been worked up,&quot; said Jeff, &quot;Since the kids are out, you want to have some fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I just made the bed,&quot; said Caaliyah in mock-frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;That just means you&#39;ll get to make it again,&quot; said Jeff teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...ok,&quot; said Caaliyah brightly. After that, the clothes came off pretty quick. Jeff didn&#39;t take the time to admire his adult body. He was working on getting his wife on the bed as fast as possible. He spread apart her legs and paused a moment. A small thought in the back of his head told him this would be a step too far. But Jeff found himself willing to take it. He plunged his cock in, making both him and Caaliyah moan. But Jeff had an advantage. Having been Caaliyah before when she had sex, he knew exactly what to do to get the most pleasure out of her.<br />
<br />
Before long, he had her screaming with pleasure. Jeff was pretty certain that Caaliyah had multiple orgasms by this point. And now Jeff was getting very close to one himself. He pounded harder into his wife, pushing himself to the edge. &quot;Better...get ready...&quot; grunted Jeff, &quot;I&#39;m gonna cum...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum in me!&quot; yelled Caaliyah, &quot;Give me more, more more!&quot; With a few last thrusts, Jeff finally came, sending a big load of sperm deep into her pussy. Caaliyah moaned, looking ready to pass out from pleasure. Jeff felt a little worn himself. Lovemaking was more exhausting than it looked, or maybe he was getting too old. But kissing his wife after that made it all worth it. It&#39;s a shame that Jeff never considered the consequences of his hasty programming of the Chronivac.</p>
