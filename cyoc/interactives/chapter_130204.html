<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Skyla&#39;s car wasn&#39;t huge, but it still was able to hold all of the maids, Skyla driving, Cassidy in the passenger seat, with Anna in the back with the toddlers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now no teleporting in the car Emma,&quot; Anna said, still feeling awkward at being the one telling young ones to behave themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Anna dearie,&quot; the toddler unicorn said with a smile. <br />
<br />
Their bodyguard nor the toddlers questioned why they were going to pay Master a visit at work, as if they really needed an excuse. <br />
<br />
Skyla, having now been freed of her job, and having liberated a half dozen other people from the work force, felt like she was gonna be queen of the road! <br />
<br />
Skyla she had no worries of being stopped by a traffic cop since all she needs to do was zap them. Then Skyla realized, &#39;The ray gun isn&#39;t invisible, just hard to notice... I don&#39;t want to get shot because the police I was pulling a &#39;real&#39; gun. The ray gun may look like it came from a dime store in the fifties, but police have been known to jump the gun for less.&#39; <br />
<br />
Skyla check her phone for traffic info, and noticed she now had a &#39;Call All Maids&#39; speed-send option. Scrolling down her contacts she found all those transformed on her list, including Emma and Kasai, though she was sure the one for Kasai was just the one for the old folk&#39;s home. Digging deeper, she found her scheduler now had digital stored a calendar of the work days and days off of the maids. <br />
<br />
This made Skyla think of how she hadn&#39;t known Kasai&#39;s name but had correctly guessed Emma&#39;s after zapping five of her co-workers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;cha checkin&#39; out Madam?&quot; Cassidy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Just reminding myself what the schedule was for everyone since we&#39;ve got so many of us that&#39;ll be working full time for master now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, given how big that place is, we could use more of us working there full time.&quot; Cassidy said. <br />
<br />
&#39;Size of the place,&#39; Again this made Skyla silently excited at what that meant, but couldn&#39;t exactly ask without it sounding just plain weird. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll help anyway we can!&quot; Emma cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kasai help too!&quot; Said the firebird hatchling. <br />
<br />
Skyla knew the changes in reality prevented anyone from seeing anything about the maids as odd (such as hot naked donkey women walking down the street), but Skyla still felt uncomfortable about putting physical toddlers to work, even if they were really old enough to remember the moon landing. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... very nice of you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Least I can do for an old friend,&quot; the little unicorn smiled.<br />
<br />
This actually sent a shiver down Skyla&#39;s tails that she didn&#39;t quite understand. How old was she now? She glanced at her tails... was she really just a fox with extra tails? Or was she a kitsune? She&#39;d be 400 to 500 years now... but what did that mean about her parents? Of her entire family tree? Skyla loved Curt and would give up anything for him, but it felt uncomfortable thinking might now just be an auntie to her own parents... Kitsune were Japanese weren&#39;t they? Was she even related to her own family anymore? This made Skyla&#39;s head spin. Why couldn&#39;t things stay nice and simple?<br />
<br />
And she thought the reality distortion option thing had been off... Things were just plain weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Anna, didn&#39;t Susan have somethin&#39; she wanted ya to tell Madam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! By the way Skyla, Sunsan said, she&#39;s close to convincing Kitty to become a maid for Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kitty?&quot; Skyla blurted out. And hoped it wasn&#39;t too big a dumb question, she&#39;d spotted Susan on her contact list. And being a fox herself, Skyla could tell the vixen was scorching hot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Susan&#39;s housemate, single mother,&quot; Anna added quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, right, that&#39;s good to hear.&quot; Skyla said formally.<br />
<br />
None of the maids complained about them still being in the parking lot, but Skyla realized that might have something to do with her declaration of being Head Maid... it was weird, she&#39;s simply declared herself that, but all the retcons to reality suggested that was exactly what she was, it wasn&#39;t programmed into the ray gun... <br />
<br />
Right, right, better get moving before she drove herself crazy with this stuff. Whatever, she was free of her old job. And she was gonna be close to Curt till the end of her days. <br />
<br />
Skyla miraculous actually managed to hold herself back from zapping some random person she saw with the ray gun on the way to Curt&#39;s job. Some dark part of her wanted to drive around looking for someone in a life or death situation and using the ray gun to obliviously save the day... But she guessed the odds of running into a situation like that twice in two days wasn&#39;t going to just fall into her lap.<br />
<br />
And she didn&#39;t want Master to think she was going completely hog wild with her turn with the ray gun, and to show she could be trusted enough to hand it back to him, least he revoke ray gun privileges on the spot.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the software company, Skyla neatly parked her car and got out, the rest of the maids following.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to see my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m keeping an eye on her. And we can&#39;t just leave the toddlers alone in the car can we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Looks like I&#39;m stuck with the pack behind me,&#39; Skyla thought as she wanted through the slide glass doors of the impressive software company.  <br />
<br />
Except none of them knew where Curt&#39;s office was. <br />
<br />
Anna hadn&#39;t exactly gone to her brother&#39;s work station before, she&#39;d have found it insanely boring, and Curt trusted his sister enough alone at home even before her transformation removed her mental blocks. <br />
<br />
And Skyla... she&#39;d never had a reason to visit her friend at work. <br />
<br />
Before Skyla was confident that if they ran into trouble she could just zap whoever they came across, but with Anna now beginning to sound like her brother and with the reveal that the ray gun came with a built in limit to not transform fathers... It made things more complicated.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, no one in the office gave them a second look, on second thought... some eyes were lingering on them, but it had nothing to do with Anna and Cassidy being naked and them being animal woman. While the people at work had been used to her retroactively, she actually could almost feel some of the guys here undressing her with their eyes. Well, Cassidy was an amazon, Anna was... too slim, and the toddlers were toddlers. Then again, she&#39;d done the same with many hot men and women she&#39;d seen before her transformation.<br />
<br />
Shaking it off she went to the information dust and asked, &quot;Where is Curt Evenson&#39;s office?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he recently move?&quot; Cassidy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just making sure,&quot; Skyla said.<br />
<br />
&#39;At least my surname is the same.&#39; Skyla thought with a very strange sense of relief when the desk jockey addressed her by name. <br />
<br />
Skyla REALLY resisted the urge to simply zap this guy, and have him obediently give her all the information they needed and get on their way, this whole thing was BORING!   <br />
<br />
No one gave the toddlers a second look, and Anna in this reality was well known enough to be recognized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Evenson, your sister and others servants are here to see you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?! Anna?&quot; Came Master&#39;s voice on the intercom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, big brother.&quot; Anna said, understanding it would be far too awkward for her to call her own brother &#39;master&#39; to his face. Anna was a maid too after all. Curt had ordered her to take what he said as suggestions, but she wasn&#39;t about to make him uncomfortable. &quot;We have a quick delivery to make before heading home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Alright come on up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Following instructions, the small pack of maids enter the meeting room with Master, Meredith, and a coworker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Head Maid Skyla,&quot; Meredith curtsied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Master,&quot; Skyla said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Curt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Anna!&quot; <br />
<br />
The siblings hugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa Curt-Sama! I&#39;ve been born again!&quot; Kasai waved her wings and flew over to Curt so he could get a closer look. Curt knew enough fantasy, and that the girls had visited the old folks home to put two and two together. And he REALLY couldn&#39;t blame them for using the ray gun. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Very good for you, I&#39;m happy to see you full of life again,&quot; Curt said as friendly as he could. Kasai reached out a golden claw while continuing to hover. Curt politely shook her claw, noting how warm her claw was to the touch.<br />
<br />
Meredith bit her lip, and balled her fists... her eyes glued on Kasai... She was shaking. <br />
<br />
Anna... feeling a little bit naughty, gave Kasai a little tickle.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHAHAHAH!&quot; The firebird laughed.<br />
<br />
Meredith broke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kasai you&#39;re so cute now!&quot; She declared and gave the bird girl a loving hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mere-chan!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t squeeze her too hard or she might pop.&quot; Skyla said shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yes Head Maid Skyla!&quot; She let go. <br />
<br />
&quot;What lovely miniature adding machines,&quot; Emma said her horn glowing and taking a small iphone off the desk and trying to play with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma, don&#39;t touch things that aren&#39;t yours,&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; She put the iphone back where she got it. <br />
<br />
Curt was as off put at seeing Anna be the mature and responsible one as Anna had been. <br />
<br />
Skyla meanwhile, wondered how much of Emma&#39;s childishness was natural, and how much was just how much she could get away with. Ironically, Kasai remained perfectly behaved since they&#39;d gotten on the bus. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it fun master?&quot; Emma asked, &quot;Now we just need to make Skyla a cute one tail kite-sun and we&#39;ll be set!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kitsune,&quot; Skyla corrected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Skyla, shouldn&#39;t you be at your job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s lunch time.&quot; Which was true, so it wasn&#39;t a lie, even if the obvious implication was deceitful. The others didn&#39;t contradict their Head Maid. <br />
<br />
Skyla wisely decided NOT to bring up the six people she&#39;d zapped at her own work place. She was betting on Curt having bigger things on his mind once he got home. <br />
<br />
Dave grinned at the sight, his eyes zeroing in on giant naked tiger woman, &quot;Hey Cassidy! Busy later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends, wanna help take care of the kids?&quot; Cassidy grinned back, gesturing at the pair of toddlers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I&#39;ll pass.&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla didn&#39;t need to some magic trick to know what Cassidy was thinking, <br />
&#39;Kids are the typical anti-horny-male forcefield.&#39; <br />
<br />
Anna looking at the scene, had the random thought: &#39;Too bad the ray gun doesn&#39;t allow for animal people butlers. I could have lots of fun riding an anthro stallion... UGH! With a saddle I mean! Ugh! Who am I worried about? It&#39;s not like anyone can hear my thoughts... still, it would be nice to have an anthro stallion friend.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your girls picks a lousy time to visit, the meeting is going to start in just a minute so I don&#39;t have much time!&quot; Curt said quickly. He&#39;d have asked Meredith to leave with them, but this apparently wasn&#39;t the first time she&#39;d been with him during a meeting and none of his coworkers appeared to think of it as odd. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright Master,&quot; Skyla bowed slightly. &quot;We just came for a quick delivery, in case you needed to find some help.&quot; She handed Curt the ray gun. &quot;I think we&#39;ve made enough use of it today, and it wouldn&#39;t be right to keep it from you, it is yours after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Curt was... very impressed. He wondered what she was up to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Curt, speaking of which,&quot; Dave said, &quot;I&#39;m enjoying the sights. But I&#39;d say we&#39;ve got about thirty seconds before everyone else arrives and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be amused that you have so many of your girls with you at work!&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla consider suggesting to Curt that he just &#39;fix&#39; that by filling the company with his own personal servants, but she had a good idea of what he&#39;d say to that, and kept her mouth shut. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see you at home then Master!&quot; Skyla quickly bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye Master!&quot; The others bowed and followed after Skyla as she left. <br />
<br />
&quot;See you later Head Maid Skyla,&quot; Meredith bowed as well and waved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Right!&quot; Anna added quickly, &quot;You need to pick up Kasai&#39;s things from the old folks&#39; home Meredith!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall obey,&quot; Meredith did the quickest bow in history. <br />
<br />
While Anna loved using the ray gun almost as much as Skyla (okay, maybe not that much) after the shock with Kasai, and Susan, she was happy to be able to go home now. It was funny, she found herself suddenly thinking of all the nice clothes she had... or used to have, or something... and realized she simply didn&#39;t care, at all, and the idea of wearing clothes now made her think of her fur getting hot and itchy. <br />
<br />
Anna hoped that Skyla bothered to learn all the names of the maids they were creating... she was supposed to be head maid after all. Hopefully she didn&#39;t become like the cat maid with the ray gun in that anime who started out calling her transformed-brainwashed subordinates by A, B, C, D! <br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, the twins are coming over too, thought you&#39;d want to know,&quot; Cassidy said.<br />
<br />
Skyla remembered the pictures and names on her phone, the two identical dragon women. <br />
<br />
And Skyla remembered how Janet was coming over to begin cooking for Master too that evening. <br />
<br />
Not to mention they had four other maids at least who would be visiting that evening to work for Master full time in their little house... And they were all going to be looking to her for leadership. <br />
<br />
&#39;... This isn&#39;t a game.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO! Madam! You okay!?&quot; Cassidy exclaimed as Skyla nearly ran a red light. <br />
<br />
Anna hugged the twins, Emma had looked a hair breath away from teleporting away in a panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;SORRY! SORRY! Just, overwhelmed at Luna and the rest joining us at home!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Hey, you&#39;re Head Maid Madam, you&#39;ll do alright,&quot; Cassidy said, total faith in her. &quot;Just don&#39;t get us killed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;R-Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna gave Skyla a dirty look as she kept hugging the twins. &quot;It&#39;s alright, don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
So how did reality work right now anyway?<br />
Janet and Rachel in the new reality were &#39;new recruits&#39; who were now able to work for master where before they could not, or at least not to the degree they wanted. The rabbits had apparently served Master in their free hours, maybe. Vicky and Eva and Susan were at the time told to stick to their day jobs, but were they? Did Meredith even still work at the toll booth? Or had she quit like Skyla? Danielle in the new reality was a park ranger as PART of the new reality so she didn&#39;t directly serve Master, but didn&#39;t seem to mind as long as it made Master happy. She was still a nudist when not on duty apparently. <br />
<br />
Marceline... oh boy... Skyla wondered how she was going to liberate her from her boring day job... even if she did, there was still that band she was part of... maybe they could be made maids too? All serve Master together as his personal musicians?<br />
<br />
Did Carrie and Kathy live with Master, since they clearly didn&#39;t live at the old folks home anymore? And what about Emma and Kasai? And how would they all even live at Master&#39;s anyway? Skyla still lived at her place, but if she had the chance, she&#39;d move all her stuff to Master&#39;s if she thought he&#39;d allow it. <br />
<br />
Skyla wasn&#39;t so lost in thought she didn&#39;t keep her eyes on the road, but she was so lost in thought that she didn&#39;t realize something important until she had driven into the drive way of Curt and Anna&#39;s house... Anna hadn&#39;t realized it either due to the angle of the car and keeping an eye on Skyla and the twins.<br />
<br />
Skyla nor Anna could stop themselves from letting out a gasp. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAO!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Cassidy said crouched, and claws ready. <br />
<br />
&quot;T-thought we had the wrong house for a minute there,&quot; Skyla said. &quot;Must be more tired than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went whoa because she did.&quot; Anna said, &quot;Herd mentality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you girls do need a rest,&quot; Cassidy said politely to the sister of her Master and her Head Maid.<br />
<br />
The house... had gotten bigger. It had been a fairly sized, but not exceptionally large house before... <br />
<br />
It also had a much more impressive front yard with gardens and trees. <br />
<br />
The house now had three stories instead of two, and had widened sideways and backwards. <br />
<br />
This was definitely Curt&#39;s taste... considering there was a marble dragon woman fountain now. <br />
<br />
Both Anna and Skyla knew the reason... reality had changed SO Curt could logically have so many maids on his payroll. <br />
<br />
Curt WOULD wonder if the other houses nearby had been squeezed out. And worried that a wealthy relative had died or something. <br />
<br />
In spite of having a beak, Kasai smiled somehow, and she flew towards the front door. <br />
<br />
&quot;-Shi kara me o samashi, jinsei ni modoru.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well spoken,&quot; Skyla said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, what did she say?&quot; Anna asked, her eyes still glued to the house. <br />
<br />
“&#39;Wake from death and return to life.&#39; It&#39;s a japanese proverbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna whispered. &quot;You know Japanese?&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla startled, &quot;I guess I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
The house was big... very big now. Three stories, big windows. Lots of green around. Pretty art that was definite in Curt tastes as said. Skyla did notice there was now a tiny Shinto shrine in the back. Kasai&#39;s? There was a catholic cross built just across from it... of course. <br />
<br />
The building looked well kept, and looked like it could healthy house twenty people if need be and still give them enough elbow room to stay sane. <br />
<br />
Skyla, as Head Maid, like in a dream, entered first... she didn&#39;t think about how she knew where the key was ... &#39;This place definitely needs better security.&#39; Skyla thought at once. <br />
<br />
If the outside took her breath away, the inside nearly made her heart stop. You could fit a apartment room in this first place. <br />
<br />
&quot;NONI!&quot; Anna cried happily, seeing her beloved pet cat playing with a little fort made of scratching post material and cat-nip.<br />
<br />
Emma and Kasai, did what children did and began to teleport and flying around like wild... Their laughter was golden. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll be somewhere else,&quot; Skyla said as Anna began exploring every nook and cranny of the house, Cassidy figuring she was just amusing herself by having her bodyguard keep up, which was fine by Cassidy in this instance, Kasai&#39;s death and rebirth had been a big deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we gonna order cake and ice cream for Kasai&#39;s birthday?&quot; Emma asked.<br />
<br />
Skyla&#39;s eyes widened, and she felt dizzy. &quot;I... maybe... I need to go sit down... Cassidy, make sure nothing bad happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it Madam!&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla wandered, unconsciously coming to a door that she wasn&#39;t even sure if it was on the second, third, ground, or sub floor... inside... A whisper in her head told her what it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;My office,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Everything inside was definitely hers, her taste, her style, or at least the one she had now... she wandered over to the desk and turned on the computer, the password was one of the ones she used and guessed it after a couple tries.<br />
<br />
She did find her computer still had an equal collection of pictures guys and girls on it. while she hadn&#39;t thought about it, but being bi&#39; apparently meant having her preferences change to fit her new gender didn&#39;t change a thing.  <br />
<br />
Skyla also realized on her computer, (and in a file cabinet to her right) she has files for the various maids (including herself and Anna).<br />
<br />
The profiles included her own personal quantification of how &#39;pleasing&#39; they each were to Master: having everything from figure measurements, stamina, their talent pools, to personality profiles. <br />
<br />
It occurred to Skyla that was a very good thing that Ray Gun explicitly did not make the new maids be willing to go to bed with Master except of their own free will. As eager she was to build the perfect life for Master for him... even she admitted how awfully that could be abused. Still, she herself was most definitely willing of her own free will! But while the idea of seducing Master was appealing... She knew it would hurt Curt incredibly to do so. <br />
<br />
While she didn&#39;t agree with it, she could appreciate Curt&#39;s values on the subject. And the idea of marrying someone or not marrying someone because of how good they were at sex was something even Skyla found shallow. <br />
<br />
Her files said that Meredith has known and worked for Curt for about a year. Her former boss, Morgan the kitten works as Curt&#39;s accountant and financial advisor and portfolio manager... <br />
<br />
