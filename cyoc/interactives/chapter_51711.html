<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You surrender?&quot; Mal'akh asked in surprise at the three wolves that came out of a mirror in the station's library.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want our help?&quot; a very tired feeling Armisael asked surprise.<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded and there was an awkward silence for a few moments. Gill and many of the pride didn't quite believe it. While Megan and Margot had promised to free the pack, and Kirk had earlier expressed his wish that the Pack and Pride could work together... none of them had expected it to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jensen nodded, &quot;we need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why should we help you?&quot; Gill wondered, coming in after hearing something on the way to his office again, &quot;YOU'RE the ultimate reason Frank and Daryl left, that twelve of my officers have lost their humanity, that nearly all of the gallery were stolen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;it's my fault really. You see, Jennifer and her friends played a mean prank on me, which embarrassed me to no end when I was Kyle... and well... in an impulsive fit of not thinking, I used a turn I had and transformed Jennifer into the first character she saw in a book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a copy of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; that I saw after my transform was given, I think the assignment was to try and trace legends and myths to common fairy tales, but to be honest, Jennifer Smith wasn't much of one for study,&quot; Jensen admitted, &quot;I'd intended to get someone else to do it for me... but that's the past now. Anyway, when I moved the book it landed open to the page where the Big Bad Wolf met Little Red Riding Hood for the first time... and this is the result.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The both of you are incredibly stupid,&quot; Gill growled, &quot;to play around with something so DANGEROUS over something so PETTY as a high school prank.&quot; Gill then looked at Jensen, &quot;you should have been mature enough to respect your classmates and not pull such pranks.&quot; Gill then turned Kaylee, &quot;and you should have thought about what you were doing before you did what you did... I mean suppose she'd been reading some book on demonology? Or the Bible, and the book of Job? Or some book on Witchcraft... you could have made things TEN times worse as it is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Jensen and Kaylee looked down, both looking guilty.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know we were stupid, sir,&quot; Kaylee gave a week whimper.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get a turn?&quot; Serenity asked the reddish brown she wolf, sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there was this girl I knew... Kathy, I think,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;She asked me out one day, and well... as Glendale's school &quot;dork&quot; I was thrilled to be asked out by one of the school's &quot;hot chicks&quot;... unfortunately I soon found out WHY didn't have a boyfriend. She was really into cats. I'm not talking about preferring cats to dogs, I'm talking outright thinking cats were superior to humans and any other animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee paused for a moment and then sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It freaked me out and I broke it off with her,&quot; Kaylee explained, &quot;after a while, I was walking down a street past a pet shop, and she was handling this tabby cat, talking to it, like it could talk back...&quot; Kaylee then looked down at Trevor, standing between Serenity and Mary, &quot;kinda looked like you... I could have sworn I heard the cat say &quot;transform or dare&quot;... and well I beat it after that. The next...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my fault,&quot; Trevor gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mary asked looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the only four legged cat in Glendale that can speak human and had a turn of the game, your Pride only has two legs remember...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They could probably run on all ours as well,&quot; Jensen commented, &quot;our pups have done so to chase rabbits around the estate. It's why our hands are a cross between human hands and a wolf's or lion's paws. We can use them as forelegs, but our thumbs are still opposable and the rest of our digits still operate like fingers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I gave this girl who picked me up, and assumed I was a normal talking cat, ears and a tail,&quot; Trevor finished, &quot;it was my only real attempt to restore my human form... but instead of asking it back to me to turn me back, she ran off... and what's sad is that I had the full intention of restoring her after she restored me, so everything would be normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity shook her head, remembering the story Trevor had told her about his attempt to become human again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I take it she gave you the turn you used to transform Jensen?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
Kaylee nodded, &quot;and then lead to my own and the Pack's formation and our brainwashing to the curse's powers. Brainwashing the Pack here in Glendale has only JUST been freed from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Freed?&quot; Serenity asked, &quot;How? I only sensed one turn used among your Pack. If Megan and Margot had freed you, there should have been a cascade of turns as you freed yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's part of why we're here,&quot; Jensen spoke to the elderly woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The other part is to settle matters with the police,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;even under the curse's influence, I didn't want a war with the Pride. My best advantage is intelligence and numbers... but my pack is my family... even if not related by blood. The way I created it was wrong, and for some Pack members I have a lot of apologizing to do... I do not want to see them harmed, and I would die if I lost Kaylee, Fran, Darla, and Julie... especially after they said they still loved me in spite of everything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you love them?&quot; Gill asked suspiciously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd DIE for them if the need arose,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;the mothers of my pups. I'm nothing without them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy?&quot; Abbey spoke as she came forward, from behind Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Jensen said weakly and gripped his youngest daughter in a hug, &quot;It's alright. We're free now, and the curse is breaking. Glendale, the Pride, the Pack... we'll all soon be free of it. I am SO TERRIBLY SORRY I scared you. So sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy,&quot; Abbey smiled and gripped him in a hug back, licking him before Jensen returned the licks as a sign of affection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan and Margot told you about Father Micheal's cure?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not that cure,&quot; Jensen spoke as he looked up from Abbey, &quot;that is where where we get to the other reason why we're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other reason?&quot; Gary asked nervously, having sent Fox to bring the rest of the Pride in to hear what Jensen was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other reason is the curse,&quot; Jensen spoke in a grim voice, &quot;apparently, between the formation of the Pack and the Pride, it gained enough power to gain full sentience and the ability to manipulate things outside of Glendale and even fully effect those in its grip within Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My word...&quot; Bobbi gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sensing Megan and Margot's plan to free the pack and Serenity's plan to kill the turns, they manipulated me to turn them into statues to try and preserve at least two turns,&quot; Jensen continued to explain, &quot;and in the resulting confusion, one of my friend's pups, Amy was knocked out and her consciousness into a strange &quot;curse world&quot; where she was confronted by the shadow of one of the three witches executed, who spat the curse down on Glendale as they died.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone there gasped in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, Amy, it appears is more then a wolf pup with the ability to transform others without the game,&quot; Jensen spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is she?&quot; Gabriel asked as he and the rest of the pride came in, catching what Jensen had said about the curse's actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;The reincarnated soul of a Shinto priestess who died when the atomic bomb went off over Hiroshima, and a practitioner of white magic,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;along with Alice, Abbey, and Samantha, I think she was the only one who wasn't brainwashed when she joined the pack... she fought with the soul of the witch, Gaal, and defeated her... in doing so, she freed the Pack that was in Glendale at the manor and restored Megan and Margot to their now normal wolf forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She freed you?&quot; Bernie asked, &quot;how? Was it something in her transform that you sneaked in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't transform her... and under the curse's influence, I wouldn't have given her the ability to kill the curse,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;we'd come to distrust it, and thus had Amy and Zelipe transformed with the ability to create wolves without the game so that it couldn't twist its will on us... what awakened the soul of the priestess, I do not know... but it has to be something. The entire pack since its formation has gradually become more and more benign as time went on... I essentially transformed Kaylee to be a sex slave... yet the longer we were together... the more that sort of aspect of our relationship become disgusting to me... not that she is bad in bed... but I was coming to love her the way a man loves his wife and I didn't want her as a sex slave or any other kind of slave. I wanted her as a companion. Someone who'd be with me through thick and thin and tell me when I'm wrong. The same goes for Fran, Darla, and Julie. It's been a benign transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's caused it?&quot; Bobbi asked, sounding surprised. It sounded like as time went on, something was making Jensen and his pack more and more &quot;civilized&quot; from behind the scenes in small ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;I've thought about it, but not long enough to figure it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said Amy defeated Gaal?&quot; Serenity asked, remembering the flash of light that went before her eyes, guessing that was the witch's destruction.<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the remaining two?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weakened, greatly and driven out of Glendale,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;but they've fled to my pack's island retreat and have seized my pack mates there, likely including Samantha, the deer we had gathered around the manor and moved there to try and regroup... I must save them. They are my Pack. Samantha is my daughter, and the deer have to be the Pack's food source in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As part of civilization you could buy meat,&quot; Felicity said with a yawn, &quot;and you're family's already rich.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn't last long,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;with up to seventy wolves, we'll only be able eat in shifts. We'd bankrupt ourselves eating. We can survive for a couple of years while Jack and Marcine's scent draws normal deer to the estate and build up a large enough herd to survive without having to depend on robbing the people of Glendale of food... your pride will likely face a similar problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Felicity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We eat roughly fifteen pounds of meat per day,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;you're likely to eat even more. If we start buying up large sums of meat from the grocery stores, we'll starve the humans of Glendale of meat... and could lead to a war over food between us. My Pack NEEDS the deer to survive... maybe if we can attract enough we can share. Bart and Jenny had some ideas about buying up large chucks of land around the estate and fencing them off as a sort of preserve, to be stocked with deer and cattle... though if we do share, Jack and Marcine are not to be harmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can talk about how both of you will feed yourselves later,&quot; Serenity spoke, nervously, &quot;what about the remaining witches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have Samantha, Daddy?&quot; Abbey asked nervously, her earlier fright back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I fear so,&quot; Jensen spoke, a tear going down his the side of his muzzle, &quot;I fear so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we must go!&quot; Abbey cried, &quot;Free my sister/cousin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is where we need the pride's help,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;the Pack is too shaken. I'd think that most of the adults will go to try and free what they see as family, but the pups are frightened. Bart and Jenny at having betrayed their employees. Martha is likely mad at me for what I did to her... I need the pride to help me distract the wolves on the island long enough for Amy and any magic practitioners you have to engage the the shadows of the witches directly. Once they're gone, Amy has assured me my pack mates there will be free and the Curse in its entirety will be beaten. Too weak to even consider resisting this cure you speak of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should leave them there if they're isolated on that island,&quot; Gill commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if they have Samantha,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;because no one goes there, it's the perfect strike base. They can go anyway and use their turns to spread this game BEYOND Glendale where it started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can these witches do to us?&quot; Gary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;it can not outright kill us because we are all creations of it. If they kill us, they would essentially commit suicide... and thanks to Amy's powers, it can not affect us the way it's affecting everyone on the island. The real problem may be in subduing those there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aside from Samantha? Cobalt, Garnett, Amethyst, Jasper, Lazuli, Emerald, Amber, Ruby, Topaz, Goldie, Tourmaline, Coral, Carnelian, Opal, and Lawrence,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;and the thirteen deer we'd already gathered... but the bulk of my Pack is in tact and free of the manipulation of the remaining witches, as is your pride. We have more then enough numbers to keep those the witches have taken distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While you risk one of your children against these witches?&quot; Serenity gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy is Zack and June's daughter,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;and if I had a different choice, I'd take it. She is pack and a pup. She shouldn't be in danger... but we do not have a choice. She is the only one of the pack possesses the magics needed to engage the witches on their own plane... and they've been weakened heavily by the loss of Gaal. In their chaos and confusion as a result from Amy's victory over Gaal... even if they didn't have my Pack... I wouldn't think they'd really stand a chance against Amy. From what she told me, the fight with Gaal was pretty one sided in her favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But to deliberately risk her...&quot; Serenity spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's also why I'm asking a favor,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;and hoping that Julie was wrong in her report to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what was that?&quot; Bobbi growled, sounding defensive of a former policemen who had devoted her life to defeating the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;That she wasn't a witch herself,&quot; Jensen answered and turned to look Serenity squarely in the eyes. Her brown meeting his golden yellow, &quot;that you are a sort of &quot;Glenda&quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The good witch from the Wizard of Oz?&quot; Serenity gasped.<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, &quot;Someone who could help Amy. Make sure she doesn't have to go it alone. She says she isn't... but I'm no expert on Shintoism or reincarnation... and any help she can be given will help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've dabbled in fortune telling and alchemy,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;but I'm afraid Julie was right. I'm no witch. The cure Father Micheal gave me doesn't depend on a sorcerer. It's magic is in the powder to kill the turns...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, &quot;So Amy will be alone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...elll heh...ulp,&quot; came Paul's voice, startling Jensen and Kaylee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well trained,&quot; Kaylee asked, bending down to take a close look at Paul, &quot;or victim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Victim,&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;unlike you, the Pride, and Trevor, the person who transformed him tried to make it impossible for him to communicate... although his best way to communicate is to either write or sign.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pride then watched in shock as Alice reached inside a reflective portion of her body and then pulled a small pad out of it to hand to Paul, along with a pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;From our study,&quot; Alice spoke as she handed it to Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will help,&quot; Paul wrote slowly, &quot;If they try anything physical against Amy, I can help... and I was a priest before my transformation and did some work in exorcising demons. Perhaps a little divine intervention can help defeat them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would help?&quot; Jensen asked, &quot;even though I'm a creature that the people have hated for absurd reasons? Even though I'm a practicing polygamist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you love them,&quot; Sasha spoke up, &quot;If you truly love your mates and they love you, it shouldn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Polygamy is a sin in my book,&quot; Paul wrote, &quot;but one could argue as to how much of a sin it is. I have not thought about it as much as around monogamous humans, the issue has never come up... but as Sasha said, if you love your mates and they love you, it can not be sinful enough to go to hell... and it is the curse, these witches that are what is truly evil and deserve to go there. And perhaps a Catholic priest and exorcist turned orangutan and a Shinto Priestess turned pup can end this once and for all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll go as well,&quot; Trevor said bravely, &quot;put the familiar that Judas has been trying to atone for in her place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor you're still hurt,&quot; Jensen spoke, &quot;I can see that... I can smell that. Amy will be in for tough fight and she is in for a tough fight, even if Paul helps. I'm sure Serenity doesn't want to lose you as a friend, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen paused trying to think of what Ulysses said the lioness cub's name was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Mary seems to like you,&quot; Jensen said, &quot;and I've still had this nagging feeling while distracting those the witches... I will pay for the sins I've committed. You should stay here... possibly even at the manor. Mr. P, Martha, and pups will look after you and Mary. We have the supplies to change your bandages. You'll be safe there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll forgive, me Jen, but your manor smells too much of dog for me,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;and witches are tied to their familiars. If they lose one, they'll get weaker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can beat a healthy cat, likely enhanced by black magic?&quot; Jensen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can try,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;I've moped and moaned too much... Queen's death only helped that along... it's time I did something. Something noble. Ending the curse will do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Trevor,&quot; Mary spoke, &quot;You've helped so much already. If it weren't for you, I would've been enslaved with the wolves. You've done so much to protect me... let us protect you for once... please... my friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor gasped in shock. He couldn't have friends, it was part of his own transform... but strangely, Mary had brought feelings of friendship back in him. If she were older, and he wasn't a house cat, he would have asked her out...<br />
<br />
And then he felt something. Something coming off the lions in the room other then the Hardys. It wrapped around him tightly, like nothing he had ever thought of before. He thought it was his mind reverting into that of a normal house cat, but strangely his body felt cramped, like it was too small. He looked to see his paws, held close to Mary's chest... they were painlessly swelling larger, his digits growing longer, his thumb looking like it was growing back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor?!&quot; Serenity gasped as his hips rearranged slightly, allowing for both erect and quadrupedal stances.<br />
<br />
He didn't fully realize he was changing when he felt larger feet touch the floor in front of Mary's red-gold paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary?&quot; Trevor gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've joined the pride!&quot; Mary said in a semi excited, semi confused voice, &quot;but how? Your form was locked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor looked himself over in surprise. He had become a male cub, about the same age as Mary. His short fur still carried the fur pattern of a tabby, but the black tuft of fur at the end of his tail, the rounded ears, and after looking at a reflective portion of Alice, the round pupils that lions had as opposed to the narrow slit pupils that his tabby form had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary is part of the pride, and we all love her,&quot; lioness Megan spoke, &quot;she's come to love you... as a protector... a guardian... and as a true friend, so we love you... the only way this could have happened was if you had come to love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She looked after me when I was hurt,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;I owe her my life. She has become a true friend... but my form was locked. I shouldn't have been able to go from a un-evolved tabby to eight year old humanoid lion cub.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor!&quot; Serenity gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor, you've trouble with numbers before,&quot; Serenity gasped, &quot;to shorten your life and prevent you from seeing it coming...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They cured me,&quot; Trevor gasped, &quot;restored my lifespan... but how? My form was locked...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But lions are still a species of cat,&quot; Jensen commented, &quot;not as agile and nimble as house cats because of their size and musculature, maybe but still cats... and locks aren't entirely certain. You all freed Ashley, Margot, and Megan, which I didn't think was possible. The game altered Caroline into Cobalt to start what its doing on our island retreat now. Going from Felis Catus to Panthera Leo Sapiens may be just a small enough alteration that the &quot;lock's&quot; hold was bent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Panthera Leo Sapiens?&quot; Gill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they were only Panthera Leo, and were only Canis Lupus, we'd all be on all fours all the time,&quot; Kaylee commented, &quot;we need some sense of distinctive naming...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary found herself agreeing with the red-brown she wolf. Trevor meanwhile looked at his new body, all previous wounds completely healed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;simply amazing. But I'm still going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor!&quot; Mary began to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm going with you,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;MARY!&quot; Brian and Felicity gasped, &quot;NO! You're our cub! Like Jensen's pups, you shouldn't be in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe this doesn't need to be as dangerous as everyone thinks,&quot; Alice commented, after being silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; came the collective voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;The witches can not affect us with his magic, but that doesn't mean they won't try something else,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;but they are still dependent on the Game's wording of &quot;transform or dare&quot;. If they have fled with the curse to the island... why not word a transform or dare to turn their magic and plans against them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Bernie asked, &quot;but it's a think of evil. Your father is guilty for the mistakes he's made under its influence, and to be honest, we're noticing some consequences of our own transform...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you were not made to have an author's mind and master of semantics,&quot; Alice spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what author...?&quot; Gill began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lewis Carroll,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;Amy's powers will throw back any potential barricade they've portrayed, and we are all to arrive together. Then all those who have turn are to voice a transform or dare to the witches themselves. They will have to answer and then we can make the witches freeze in place as they are. Amy and Paul can ten destroy them, freeing those on the island, and the time we'd have to actually fight would be relatively short as once the witches freeze in place, their enslaved prisoners will as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't that risk committing suicide?&quot; Jensen asked, &quot;I mean, even if we're all good now... civilized... however you want to put it... we're still tied to the curse. If we use the Game to kill the witches, we could kill ourselves as well. I mean when Amy destroyed Gaal and freed us, we were all thrown about the manor. Kaylee and Julie were thrown through a window.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness for thick guard hairs,&quot; Kaylee commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;The transform or dare would only freeze them,&quot; Alice explained, &quot;render them incapable of attacking with their own magic or sending the Gem wolves, Samantha, Lawrence and the deer after us. It will be Amy that finishes them off and frees the pack. The &quot;freeze&quot; on their slaves would only last until Amy has destroyed the witches with Paul and Trevor's help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Begin wording it out,&quot; Jensen told her, &quot;your pack and your sister is counting on you. And we must move fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, father,&quot; Alice nodded.<br />
<br />
Jensen then turned to Gill.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not part of the Pride,&quot; Gill answered, &quot;they serve me as the police chief, but I'm not part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will help though,&quot; Gary volunteered, &quot;to put an end to the Curse's evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Jensen nodded, &quot;and thank you... but there is little time. Amy and those of the Pack who will be going are already waiting. Those who's forms are locked, come through the mirrors with us. It will be faster. Those who's forms aren't... if you're coming, you'd best drive. Our gate will be open.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Amy sat in quiet meditation, with June and Zack standing close behind her. In her meditation world, cherry blossoms blew through the air of a pristine Japanese garden outside a Shinto Shrine, and kneeling beside her was Ami, the soul she had been reincarnated from. It was a little strange to Amy, but it answered her questions as to why she added Japanese syntax as to why she was so different from her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will the witches kill anyone, Ami?&quot; Amy asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;I do not sense that. But I do sense broken bones and some flesh wounds... sadly... but no one will die or suffer an injury that will not heal. We must be brave, Amy, for what is coming will be HARD. They are confused and insane... Gaal was more powerful, but Gaal's mind was still functional, allowing her to control her attacks. Her sisters are flailing about as if in a blind panic... trying to save their evil&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we do not move quickly, they will...&quot; Amy sighed in a frustrated voice.<br />
<br />
Ami nodded, but didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we save the ones they've enslaved? Can the pack? Or the pride?&quot; Amy asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Pride shares no connection to us... other then the few gallery wolves that were policemen and women and through Fran and Darla,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;but strong feelings of love... be it brother/sister, sister/sister, or mates should break the hold of the witches on those there, but that would really only free Lawrence and Samantha... as Abbey and Alice will be going, and they will free their sister... and Megan, Margot, Ashley, and Anne, I sense will do the same with Lawrence... the real question if this is to be the answer is what to do about the gem wolves... The only one with a tight connection to the pack is Caroline... but her true love is Opal... who is already enslaved. They will be dependent on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we shall win,&quot; Amy said confidently.<br />
<br />
&quot;And end their evil forever,&quot; Ami agreed.</p>
