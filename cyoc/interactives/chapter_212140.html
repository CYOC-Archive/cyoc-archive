<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A naked and rock hard Kate greeted Jacob at the door. His form fitting button up shirt and tie drew her attention to his tight ass in his wetlook business leggings.<br />
<br />
Jacob kissed his wife passionately, her long tongue dancing deep into his mouth, and his tongue finding its way deep into his wife&#39;s throat. Katie massaged Jacobs stiff nipples poking through his shirt, one in each hand. The two enjoyed a long kiss before withdrawing their tongues from each other. Jacob was quick to ask, &quot;Any time on the computer today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Kate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmm....then we better go check. When I left this morning, I could have sworn that this was a cotton button up shirt, not a skin tight stretchy button up number that it is now,&quot; Jacob explained.<br />
<br />
The two went into the home office, and opened the Chronivac app. The two did not know that the app had been running in the background all day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; Jacob gasped angrily. Jacob sat down in the chair, leaned back as his fourteen inch cock throbbed, and pondered the situation. Kate pulled up another chair to sit down and read through the various menus and logs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know,&quot; said Kate. Her cock bobbing hard against her belly. She spent the whole day masturbating and a few brief naps during recharges. She was being honest that she had not been on the computer that day. &quot;My god...,&quot; Kate softly exclaimed, working through the now much more extensive reality changes. Kate was a fully functional female hermaphrodite now. Jacob was also a shemale now, he had ovaries but without a womb. Their adult kids had changed into female herms like their mother. &quot;This says you have DD cups. You don&#39;t have...,&quot; Kate stopped talking as she saw the chest and thick nipples poking through Jacob&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea....they grew in throughout the day. I was in a meeting this afternoon when I noticed that the eye contact was on my chest and not my face. That&#39;s not all. My gut is almost flat, and my legs and butt have noticeable muscle definition,&quot; Jacob said reluctantly.<br />
<br />
Kate saw the bulge between Jacob&#39;s legs....then went to the screen. &quot;I didn&#39;t even come in here today,&quot; Kate said with a somber tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must have missed something. Something to merge the changes between profiles or to adapt the defaults. I still do not see how this happened,&quot; Jacob lamented.<br />
<br />
Kate sighed, &quot;So far, only we know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob stated in disbelief, &quot;I see you have no body hair, and neither do I. I did not have a ponytail when I left this morning, yet I had to borrow a hair tie at lunch. Nothing seemed off until I got home. It was normal, and that&#39;s what bothers me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate just noticed that both of them looked to be about thirty in the on screen profiles. Her chest and his chest had a firm yet supple look. Both now had female hips, and a very feminine waist/belly profile. Jacob&#39;s male gut was gone. They both how sported the cocks from last night, thick and fourteen inches long. Jacob&#39;s profile showed a craving for anal sex and physical dependency on Katie&#39;s or his own semen and seminal fluid. How could she not have known or realized this...that question bothered Katie.<br />
<br />
Jacob took a deep breath, &quot;So...,&quot; and another deep breath, pausing for a few moments, &quot;...any other changes you want to make or undo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate looked at Jacob with some puzzlement, &quot;You ask that in an interesting way. I don&#39;t think the changes are finished, but as far as undo...I am curious to see where this goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob sighed. He did not want to give into this desire he felt. He did not want to be a slave to his lusts, but he did like what had happened. &quot;Alright,&quot; Jacob relented. He really needed to milk a thick cock, and that did not bother him. He looked forward to milking Kate&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Kate served a light supper, before they went into the bedroom and Jacob finally got what he wanted, a generous helping of the thick seed from Kate&#39;s inch diameter testicles. He felt like an addict getting his fix, his body relaxed as he milked Kate&#39;s cock. The younger bodies they now had let them go past midnight again, with Kate sliding in a large butt plug into Jacob so he could fall asleep while she got a shower and joined him in bed. Kate joined Jacob in bed, who was conscious enough to slide his hard cock into her ass, before pulling her tight and driving back off asleep.<br />
<br />
The 7 am alarm went off, and Jacob slowly got up and went to the bathroom. Kate slept as Jacob returned and nuzzled between her legs and took her cock deep into his mouth/throat as it slowly formed into an oral vagina. The first orgasm caused Kate to awaken, but she fell back into a groggy half-sleep state as Jacob kept her on edge during the recharge, and Katie lasted through two more massive orgasmic waves before Jacob slowly pulled off and got his shower before work. Kate was sitting at the vanity when Jacob got out of the shower. Kate got into the shower after doing Jacob&#39;s shoulder length hair, inflating his butt plug, and helping him zip up his faux leather reddish-tan bodysuit and tie. Jacob and Kate kissed, but Kate&#39;s tongue was starting to be more cock like, and Jacob worked Kate&#39;s tongue like a cock and brought is wife to orgasm, where she shot all over the left leg of his work suit. Kate was quick to wipe off her cum from the easy to clean suit after the kiss. Neither spoke as Jacob walked into the garage, with a naked Kate masturbating to his tight, muscular body that showed every dimple and curve through that bodysuit.</p>
