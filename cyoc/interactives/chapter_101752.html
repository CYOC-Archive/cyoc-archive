<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>My love has come along</i><br />
<i>My lonely days are over</i><br />
<i>And life is like a song</i><br />
“At Last” by Etta James<br />
<br />
Then he whispered in her ear, “Whenever you&#39;re ready,” unaware of the additional emotional pressure he had just placed upon his girlfriend.<br />
Uncertain what to say, Julie Stovall just stared at Eric Anderson and smiled. He returned the gesture, not knowing that his eyes now seemed to be in a continuous swirl, undecided if they should be normal human brown or were-merman deep sea blue.<br />
That decision rested upon whatever his girlfriend decided to do next.<br />
<br />
<i>I do love him, and I know Eric loves me, but why am I so hesitant?</i> Julie asked herself, despite already knowing the answer.<br />
She was afraid of those first painful moments during the loss of her virginity as her vagina accepted and welcomed Eric.<br />
It was bad enough having to deal with what her mother called “the monthly visitor”, but thankfully the next one wasn&#39;t due until the beginning of November, after the Halloween dance.<br />
It distressed Julie that even her own mother agreed with every source she could access that there would be at least some discomfort the very first time, but no one could agree on exactly how much.<br />
Would it be the sexual equivalent of stubbing one&#39;s toe, or much more severe?<br />
<i>I do love him,</i> she said to herself, as Eric gently reached out to hold her hands in his.<br />
<i>Eric&#39;s willing...</i> knowing that doing so would permanently make him a were-merman.<br />
HER were-mer!<br />
<i>A lifetime of romantic pleasure together...</i> thought Julie, staring at the one she loved.<br />
<i>For a moment of pain...</i><br />
<br />
Then Julie Stovall leaned forward and kissed her boyfriend, even as she reached down to caress Eric Anderson&#39;s penis with one hand.<br />
<i>I can do this,</i> she thought to herself, as Eric broke the kiss. He smiled at her, and then laid naked across the top step of the Stovall family&#39;s swimming pool. The bulk of his body fit quite nicely, and Eric secretly suspected he might now know the reason why they had a traditional size staircase running across the narrow edge of the shallow end, instead of a smaller arrangement of steps in just one corner.<br />
His left leg was straight out from his torso across the step. Eric&#39;s left arm was draped over the outer edge of the pool for personal comfort. That and being propped on his right elbow helped him maintain somewhat of a sitting up position to gaze at Julie&#39;s beauty.<br />
Eric&#39;s right leg was at an angle with his foot on a lower step, to give Julie more access and freedom of movement for what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
Julie looked at the naked boy laying before her, even as her own nude form now towered over him.<br />
<i>Eric looks so happy,</i> she thought, staring at him lovingly.<br />
<i>He wants this. He wants and loves ME! I CAN do this!</i><br />
As she slowly moved into position, Julie took another look at his penis. It stood relatively straight and proud at a slight angle in relation to the rest of him.<br />
<i>Kind of like the Leaning Tower of Pisa,</i> she thought, managing to keep from giggling.<br />
Julie was in no rush, despite the silent urges of her body. She wanted to thoroughly enjoy every moment and at least delay, if not lessen, the pain&#39;s arrival as long as she could, too.<br />
Standing over Eric with a foot on either side of his waist, Julie started slowly bending her knees, lowering her body closer to his.<br />
When it was within arm&#39;s reach, she reached out with her right hand and soon felt Eric&#39;s penis within her fingers again.<br />
<br />
Eric never said a word. He just kept smiling at her, anticipating the moment of their actual union, let alone what would happen afterwards. Both were growing stronger within him, but Eric wanted the love instead of the urges to win the day.<br />
<i>Together forever. Mrs. Julie Anderson...</i> he thought happily.<br />
Julie was close enough to him now that she could guide the tip of Eric&#39;s organ around the outer folds of her vagina, just like he did with his finger earlier.<br />
She felt herself growing moist inside, a feeling akin to, but not quite as strong as, the sensations that built up before experiencing the orgasms Eric had already given her.<br />
Then Julie got a little bolder and started using the head of Eric&#39;s member like a paintbrush to tease the opening within the center of her vagina. She could swear she felt it growing wider and leaking, as if preparing to welcome this strange visitor.<br />
<i>I know what I want, but I&#39;m still in control!</i> Julie told herself, even as she let go of Eric&#39;s penis.<br />
The head flexed to position itself somewhat within her moist slit.<br />
“Ooooohhhhh.....” both girl and boy practically moaned in unison, relishing the feeling.<br />
Then Julie started lowering herself further, slowly accepting Eric into her.<br />
Her whole body shivered in pleasure.<br />
Julie looked down and saw Eric was having a similar physical experience. His body was starting to tremble in eager anticipation.<br />
Then everything stopped as his member encountered the lone obstacle in its path.<br />
Her hymen.<br />
<br />
Contrary to ancient beliefs, the hymen did not completely block the entrance to a woman&#39;s inner depths. Otherwise, she would never be able to urinate. However, the additional flesh around the inner entrance did narrow that opening, thus creating the pain factor involved during a woman&#39;s first time having sex.<br />
Julie tried slowly rising and lowering herself again, but her hymen remained intact.<br />
She then tried letting her own body weight move her, but stopped and raised herself slightly when Julie felt her hymen start to tear.<br />
The disconnecting, sensitive nerve tissue created only one reaction.<br />
<i>PAIN!</i><br />
Julie looked down at Eric, who by this point had figured out what was going on.<br />
He tried smiling at her once more, but was greatly concerned over the look of grimace on Julie&#39;s face.<br />
“There&#39;s no rush dearest. If not now, maybe later,” suggested Eric, not wanting to hurt his beloved.<br />
Julie looked down at the mixed expression of care and love on her boyfriend&#39;s face.<br />
Then she saw that Eric&#39;s eyes had gone back to being brown again, and that made her sad.<br />
With that, she made her decision.<br />
She reached out and took his hands in hers.<br />
Holding them tightly, Julie Stovall said, “I love you Eric Anderson. This is for <b>US!</b>”<br />
And with that, she released her legs and instantly sank fully against Eric, his shaft going completely into her vaginal tunnel, destroying the hymen forever in the process.<br />
<br />
Julie just continued to stare at Eric as they held each other&#39;s hands.<br />
While there was pain, more than she was willing to admit or had been originally prepared to deal with, she refused to acknowledge or give in to it. Julie would not cry out or shed a tear, unless it was in joy.<br />
Eric gasped when she sank down on him, more concerned for her than the (wonderful, he would later admit,) sensation of diving completely into her depths for the first time.<br />
She sat there straddling him, feeling Eric&#39;s penis twitch happily being surrounded by his girlfriend, even as Julie tried to adjust to the situation.<br />
The first few seconds of pain were the most intense. A brief flashback to her four year old self couldn&#39;t be helped.<br />
Trying to assist her mom in the kitchen one day, Julie had accidentally hurt herself with a sharp knife. The incident required a trip to the emergency room and several stitches, also creating her childhood fear of pain that had persisted to this point in her life.<br />
But while the rational part of Julie&#39;s mind knew how deep and true their love was, seeing Eric&#39;s eyes turn brown again and the illogical fear of possibly losing him made her take action.<br />
Yet, as she stared at her soul mate, the pain started to subside.<br />
In fact, Julie Stovall was beginning to really enjoy having Eric Anderson intimately within her.<br />
<i>A lifetime of romantic and sexual pleasure together in exchange for a moment of pain.</i><br />
In hindsight, the price was worth it!<br />
<br />
“Are you all right?”<br />
Eric had repeated the question, for Julie didn&#39;t answer him the first time.<br />
It would be awhile before either commented about how wonderful and right it was to lose their virginity to their soul mates.<br />
Neither would ever notice the small trickle of blood that had emerged from Julie and was now being diluted within the fresh water pool.<br />
All that mattered to Eric Anderson at that moment was her well being.<br />
Yet all that mattered to Julie Stovall as she stared at her boyfriend was the fact that his eyes had now permanently changed color to a bright shade of deep sea blue.<br />
“Are you—” Eric started to ask again, but was interrupted as Julie leaned forward and kissed him.<br />
“I&#39;m wonderful and ready darling,” said Julie, after breaking the kiss.<br />
Then she slowly raised and lowered herself on Eric&#39;s penis again.<br />
<br />
Eric thought the second trip into Julie&#39;s depths was just as great as the first.<br />
So was the third. And the fourth. And the fifth. And...<br />
He soon lost count, but didn&#39;t care as Julie slowly started establishing a rhythm between them.<br />
Up and down. As gentle as waves upon the ocean.<br />
In time, Eric started managing to match Julie&#39;s movements. Flexing his body upward as she came down and vice versa. Together, they soon started sharing their first intimate session of love making.<br />
On one downward thrust, Julie leaned forward, her whole body against his, the hard nipples of her breasts poking against his chest.<br />
They wrapped their arms around each other the best they could with Eric still laying on the top step and resumed kissing, their tongues playfully darting in and out of each other&#39;s mouths even as their bodies continued their rhythmic dance together.<br />
<br />
Neither could swear as to when they had started picking up the pace, but soon all thoughts of romantic gestures were gone as their bodies started moving faster together, thrusting against each other as if in a race against time with only one goal.<br />
A feat they accomplished moments later as Julie Stovall and Eric Anderson experienced their first mutual orgasm.<br />
<br />
Spent for the moment, Julie laid on top of Eric as he held her close, his penis shuddering in joyful unison from an aftershock within her.<br />
Even the very thought of what they had just did and accomplished sent additional shivers of pleasure through the couple.<br />
The soul mates had declared and consummated their love in romantic unison, without being driven by urges they had no control over.<br />
Then Julie raised her head and said “I love you Eric Anderson.”<br />
“And I you Julie Stovall,” he said, before they kissed again.<br />
At that point, Julie just wanted to lay there, basking in the afterglow and enjoying the warmth of his body against hers.<br />
But as she reached out to hold his hand, Julie felt it!<br />
She looked and saw the webbing start to form between Eric&#39;s fingers.<br />
Julie turned back to Eric and smiled.<br />
The best was yet to come!</p>
