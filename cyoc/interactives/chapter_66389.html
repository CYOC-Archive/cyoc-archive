<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen pulled her hand free from her her crotch and reached for her pants. She couldn't believe she had just done that. Left over images of all the random changes that had bombarded her mind still fluttered through her head. She pulled her pants up, shaking. She didn't want to get out of the car. She remembered what she had just done to Amanda and felt a wave of hunger wash over her at the same time as her guilt. She... he was probably fucking some slutty cheerleader right now.. or a football player.. <br />
<br />
Jen shook her head, she had to find her friend and try and undo what she had done. She hesitated only a moment before opening the car door and walking toward the school. A couple rows away she noticed a van rocking and some odd noises. She ignored it and kept walking. She made it to the front doors and pushed her way inside, blocking out every face she passed and praying she wouldn't get distracted. She had only changed one person and she was going to fix it she was going to... She saw her friend Eric walking toward her smile on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit Jen, you missed it! Some psycho guy just walked in here a couple minutes ago dressed like a chick. His fucking dick was hanging down below his skirt, I shit you not.&quot; Eric said, incredulity plastered on his face. &quot;I hope someone called the cops to get that fucked up asshole out of here. The last I saw he was trying to kiss one of the football players! Can you fucking imagine? The horny bastard.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen looked around the emptying hallway, emotions stumbling over each other inside her mind. Guilt at what she had done was pushed aside by anger at Eric for being so cruel to Amanda, even if he had no way of knowing. Then thoughts of revenge quickly changed her anger into her new unfamiliar hunger. She glared at Eric and released her power, knowing even as she did so that she would regret it but being unable to control herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;You think that 'guy' was so fucked up? Well maybe you should look in a mirror.&quot; Jen spat acidly. Eric stepped back, stunned at the reaction. Then he doubled over. Jen watched eagerly as Eric's muscled body seemed to deflate, his form shrinking in on itself until he was thin and short, even shorter than herself. Eric stood and stared at his new thin arms and small hands in disbelief. <br />
<br />
Confusion spread across his face and he looked down sharply at his chest. His pecs bubbled outward, two nearly spherical balls of white flesh beneath his shirt, each tipped with a fat round nipple that pressed into the thin cloth. Eric's dark hair fell down around his head and the color bleached away, leaving almost glowing blond locks curling around his face. His hands fell to his crotch, reaching in his now very baggy pants. The look on his face told everything that was going on down below. His face was the last to change, his skin smoothing, becoming clear of hair. His jaw pointed and eyebrows arched. Pouty lips puffed out red and luscious, painted with a deep crimson lipstick.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell happened to me?!&quot; Eric whined, his new voice womanly and sultry. He tried to hold up his pants but kept stumbling on the pant legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;You had no idea what Amanda was going through and you still ran up to the first person you saw to tell how fucked up she was. Well, you're about to join her.&quot; Jen said. Her skin was hot, sweat dappling her forehead, she was breathing hard. She could feel the wetness in her panties from watching Eric change. The big breasted blond that was Eric looked at Jen in horror. Jen couldn't stop now though and cast the second part of the spell.  The terror bled from the blond's blue eyes and was instead filled with... nothing. Eric stared vapidly at Jen. He let the pants fall to the ground uncaring his shaved pussy bare to the world.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You were saying something about a guy dressed as a girl Eric?&quot; Jen asked calmly, fighting the urge to reach down her own pants as she waited for the response. Eric blinked dumbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was? Oh ya right. Like he totally was wearing girly things. Like a dress and other stuff.&quot; Eric paused a moment as his mind caught up with his mouth and then continued. &quot;I could like totally see his huge dick. It looked sooo juicy down between his skirt.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya?&quot; Jen asked. &quot;It was big?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ya, huge! I wanted so bad to see how much of it I could fit in my mouth!&quot; Eric grabbed his new tits and pressed them together roughly, his pretty eyes rolling back at the thought of that thick cock in his mouth. &quot;Actually think I saw him head toward the locker rooms.. I uh, I have to go to.. err..&quot; Eric's mind faltered as he tried to come up with a lie and finally just blurted. &quot;I am going to see if that hunky guy will fuck my tight pussy.&quot; He walked away, leaving the rumpled pants and boxers in the hall, his sexy slut body covered only by a now over sized t-shirt that still left a small tight ass poking out beneath. <br />
<br />
Jen shuddered, heat rushing through her body. It wasn't what Eric was saying that was turning her on it was the fact that this WAS Eric, that he had been changed into this.. this stupid bimbo that had her trembling with the hunger of her new fetish. She knew she had to stop this, she had to leave. She shuddered again as she saw the nearly naked Eric skip around the corner in search for Amanda's huge dick. Jen didn't think she was going to be able to leave..</p>
