<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We continued on our way to the mall.  Our shopping trip was rather uneventful after the encounter on the street.  We made stops at several stores and bought everything we could think of: shoes, underwear, bras, lingerie, jeans, skirts, blouses, t-shirts, dresses, everything.  I could tell that some of the girls that worked at some of the stores were not happy with us.  It was probably either due to being naked, which my wish would only have them think with morally and legally OK, or the fact that we laughed every time we were asked how we were going to pay.<br />
<br />
Since we had just way too much to carry, after we left every store I wished that all of our purchases would transport back to our apartment.  We finally decided to put on some clothes after we were finished.  We dressed in t-shirts that only just reached down to our waists and shorts that were only just long enough to cover our butts.  We also made sure to wear bras and thongs as well.<br />
<br />
“God, this feels sexy,” Valerie said once we were dressed.<br />
<br />
“Yea, it does,” I agreed.  “I still like being naked, though.”<br />
<br />
“I bet we don’t get as much attention going home,” Valerie said.<br />
<br />
I smiled.  “We’ll see,” I said.<br />
<br />
We left the mall and started on our way home.  We walked a different way than when we came to the mall.  After a few minutes I realized where we were.  “Hey, we’re on Center Street,” I said.<br />
<br />
“So?” Valerie asked.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t Dennis Whitman live on this street?” I asked.  Dennis was a guy who graduated high school with us.  We were both friendly with him, but I don’t know if he would be best described as an actual friend.<br />
<br />
“I think so,” she answered.  “Why?”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t seen him for years.  I’m curious what he’s been up to,” I explained.<br />
<br />
Valerie shrugged her shoulders.  “I heard he’s still the same.  Stays in his house and all of that, doesn’t really have friends,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” I said.  “Let’s go say ‘hi.’”<br />
<br />
“Why?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Because,” I said, “we liked him and it’s been a while.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, but things are a little different now,” she protested.  “We’re not the same people.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” I said.<br />
<br />
“My wish made it so that everyone would remember us as female, except us.  Do you want to test that in front of your parents?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Probably not,” she agreed.  “But why should I doubt that it worked?”<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t, but wouldn’t it still be better to make sure with an old friend than with your family?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment.  “Yea, that could be interesting,” she said.  “Do you know for sure that he still lives here?”<br />
<br />
I made a silent wish to know if he did.  I promptly knew the answer.  “Yep, he sure does,” I replied.<br />
<br />
“That ring is just one big know-it-all,” she said.  “I think I’d hate it if it didn’t give me this,” she said as she gestured to her body.<br />
<br />
“Silly you,” I giggled.<br />
<br />
It took us a few minutes to get to Dennis’ house.  From what I remembered Dennis didn’t have a father, but did have an extremely domineering mother.  I anticipated we would have an interesting encounter with her.  Dennis’ house was all brick on the outside which disguised its age.  It was in an old part of town where the houses were all around 50 years old.  It was fairly narrow but was also deep so that it appeared smaller than it really was.<br />
<br />
We walked up the three steps to the porch.  There was a considerable mess that lay strewn over the porch.  It didn’t seem that upkeep was a primary concern.  “Yeesh,” Valerie whispered as she nervously rang the doorbell.  The sound of the doorbell incited a flurry of activity within the house.  We heard several dogs barking and a voice bellowed for them to be quiet.<br />
<br />
The door swung open to reveal a woman in her late 40’s.  She had a considerable amount of wrinkles on her face and her hair was gray with a few patches of brown that remained.  A cigarette dangled from her mouth.  “What do you girls want?” she asked in a raspy voice.<br />
<br />
“Is Dennis here?” Valerie asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re kidding me,” she said.  She turned around and shouted over her shoulder, “Dennis, your hookers are here!”<br />
<br />
I was furious.  “Excuse me?” I asked indignantly.<br />
<br />
“No, no, we’re friends of Dennis,” Valerie explained.  She looked at us disbelievingly.  “From high school,” she added.<br />
<br />
“Dennis had friends in high school?” she asked as she took a drag from the cigarette.  “Well, whatever ya are, I suppose you can come in.”  She backed away from the door to allow us to enter.<br />
<br />
“Gee, thanks,” I said sarcastically as we walked inside.<br />
<br />
“Sorry for being suspicious, dearie, but Dennis doesn’t often entertain, especially not girls,” she said.  Her tone didn’t convey sorrow to me.  “He’s down in his bunker,” she said as she pointed to a door at the end of a long hallway.  “I’d show you down but I’m forbidden to enter unless I want to hear him whine his damn fool head off for a week.  Just be careful with them high heels on the stairs, they’re steep.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Valerie said and we walked toward the door.  Behind us we heard the sound of the dogs return followed by the sound of Dennis’ mother yelling at them to be quiet.<br />
<br />
I led the way through the narrow hall and took notice of the state of the house.  The walls looked decayed with the wallpaper peeled away in several places.  There was a weird odor that permeated.  I guessed it was a combination of a couple of things since I couldn’t place just one odor.  I opened the door when we reached it and found that the warning was well-heeded.  The stairs immediately went to the left and were extremely difficult to navigate in our high heels.  The heels made very loud clicking noises on the stairs.  About halfway down I noticed another door waiting at the bottom of the stairs off to the left.<br />
<br />
“Better knock,” Valerie said when I got to the bottom.  I decided that it was a good idea after I noticed two large signs that said “KEEP OUT” and “No Woman Zone.”<br />
<br />
A few seconds later the door opened.  I expected to see a nerdy-looking young man with thick glasses and bad skin.  I was shocked when I saw a very handsome man with a perfect and blemish-free complexion and no glasses.  He did a double take when he saw us.  “Well, this is a surprise!” he exclaimed.</p>
