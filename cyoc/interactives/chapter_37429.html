<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick:<br />
<br />
This wasn't good. Here I was in my sister's room and I was a girl. Dad came in and asked &quot;Who are you and what are you doing in my daughter's room!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't think that they'd believe me but I had to try. &quot;It's me, Rick&quot; I said. &quot;I know that this is hard to believe but it really is me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't try making a fool out of me&quot; Dad said. &quot;Rick is my son. He is not a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how this happened&quot; I said. &quot;I was reading a book and fell asleep. When I woke up I was like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With your skirt and panties down?&quot; Dad asked, his arms crossed and a skeptical look on his face.<br />
<br />
Looking down I remembered that I was naked below my waist. Blushing I quickly pulled my panties back up and then my skirt. What an embarrassing situation. &quot;I can explain that&quot; I said. &quot;I wanted to see if I was completely female. Please, you have to believe me. I am Rick. Ask me a question only Rick would know the answer to if you don't believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll bite&quot; Dad said. &quot;If you are Rick, what did I say to you on your twelfth birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you'd make it hard&quot; I said. &quot;You drew me off to the side and told me that you knew I would be changing my mind about girls soon if I hadn't already. You told me that I should wait until I found the right girl before having sex. You then went into a little speech about the consequences of unprotected sex. You then told me that even though you strongly disapproved of me having sex before I<br />
was eighteen you knew that I may. You handed me a condom that was ribbed for her pleasure and said that if I should have sex before I was eighteen to use a condom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad was wide eyed by the time I finished. Finally he said &quot;I believe you. But this is... this is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Impossible&quot; I supplied. &quot;How do you think I feel? I'm the one who woke up a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you still look sixteen&quot; Mom said. &quot;At least there's that. Though how did you get into Michelle's room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering that myself&quot; Michelle said. &quot;I locked my door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure how I got in&quot; I said. &quot;One moment I was standing in front of your door and the next I was standing in front of your mirror. I remember seeing myself standing in front of your mirror in my mind. It was like I was teleported. Let me try something.&quot;<br />
<br />
I imagined myself standing next to Michelle's bed and that strange feeling came over me. Next thing I knew I was standing next to Michelle's bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is really weird&quot; Michelle said. &quot;Not only do I now have a sister but she's able to disappear from one place and reappear in another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how far you can go&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
I suddenly thought about my book. The heroine was able to teleport anywhere in the world she wanted as long as she was able to picture it in her mind. If I had all of her powers then my life could be interesting. &quot;I think I may be able to go anywhere in the world&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you take other people?&quot; Michelle asked. &quot;I've always wanted to see Ireland.&quot;<br />
<br />
I again thought back to my book. The heroine could take up to three people with her. &quot;If I'm right then I can take you, Mom, and Dad&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we need to figure out how this happened&quot; Dad said. &quot;Can you think of anything that will shed some light on this Rick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I had this strange dream&quot; I said. &quot;I entered a UFO that was in the woods. Someone was calling me and I went. But it was just a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might not have been&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Rick is now a girl&quot; Michelle said. &quot;That goes against all we know. Having aliens change him would explain what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard&quot; Dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;More ridiculous than Rick becoming a girl?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no&quot; Dad said. &quot;I guess that it could be possible. Hell, he probably was transformed by aliens. That isn't any stranger than becoming a girl all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think that they'll reverse this?&quot; Mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know why they did it in the first place&quot; Dad said. &quot;They may be planning on undoing it or they may not. It's anybody's guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then Rick needs a new name&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't want a new name&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately you don't have much of a choice&quot; Mom said. &quot;You're a girl now and for the foreseeable future. You need a girl's name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want a girl's name though&quot; I said. &quot;I'm happy with my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm still your mother and you will have a girl's name as long as you're a girl&quot; Mom said sternly. I knew better than to argue with her. &quot;I'll go online and see if I can find a feminine form of your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Mom did indeed find a feminine form of my name. &quot;Well until you're changed back your name is Richelle&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like my name&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the site does say that it's probably influenced by the sound of Michelle&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is going to take some getting used to&quot; Dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as much as me&quot; I said. &quot;I am the one who's gender was changed after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy for you to say&quot; I said. &quot;You were born a girl. I don't know anything about being a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll help you&quot; Michelle said. &quot;That's what an older sister is for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest we all get some sleep&quot; Mom said. &quot;Richelle, you look like you're about the same size as Michelle so you can borrow some of her clothes. At least until we have a chance to buy you some.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get her measurements Mom&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
Michelle led me back to her room and once there said &quot;Ok, strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to strip in front of you&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're my sister&quot; I said. &quot;It's not right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn't be right if you were still a boy&quot; Michelle said. &quot;But you are a girl now Richelle. We have the same sex organs so it's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I have to strip anyway?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want clothes that fit don't you?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I do&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we need to get your measurements&quot; Michelle said. &quot;To do that it's best to not wear any clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; I said and proceeded to strip. My bra gave me a bit of trouble getting it off but Michelle helped me. Once I was naked Michelle had me stand straight but relaxed. She took out a cloth measuring tape and a notepad. She then began to measure me.<br />
<br />
Once she was done Michelle said &quot;Well your measurements are the same as mine except for your cup size. You're a c cup while I'm a d cup. You'll have to wear your bra until you get some more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why won't I be able to wear one of your bras?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not comfortable wearing a bra that's a larger cup size than you are&quot; Michelle said. &quot;Mom will probably take you clothes shopping later. Right now let's get some sleep. You can borrow one of my nightgowns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; I said as she handed me a nightgown. After I had put it and my panties on I felt a pressure on my bladder. &quot;Oh get, I need to pee&quot; I said more to myself than to Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then go&quot; Michelle said. &quot;Just remember that you're a girl now. You need to pee sitting down and you need to wipe after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's to avoid infection&quot; Michelle asked. &quot;Besides, having even a little pee in your panties is gross. Go ahead and go pee. I'll take your clothes to your bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, thanks&quot; I said. I made my way to the bathroom to pee. Once there I locked the door as I usually do and looked at the toilet. The seat was up so I put it down. I wondered if I should take off the nightgown but decided that it would be too much of a hassle so I just hiked it up instead. I pulled down my panties and sat down. It was a different sensation peeing from a different spot and sitting down. After I was done I went to stand up then remembered that I had to wipe.<br />
<br />
I went back to my room and went to bed sure that I wouldn't be able to sleep. To my surprise I fell asleep almost immediately.</p>
