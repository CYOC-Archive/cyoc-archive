<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the pair walked out of the store, Cray stopped.<br />
&quot;oh wait, I forgot something. Be right back, okay?&quot; He said, patting Guy on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...sure thing.&quot; He replied, a little self conscious on the street with his plumper build. He leaned on the building and waited. In a few minutes, Cray came back out holding a big bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally forgot what I was here for. Ever try that old guy's cream for treating sore and stiff muscles?&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy shook his head no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you should. I swear by it. It's how I'm able to keep this body up and running.&quot; He smiled and readjusted the bag. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
When they got to Cray's condo, Guy was fascinated by the high end workout machinery he had. It was amazing stuff, way better than the machinery at the gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... you must've spent a fortune on this stuff Cray. It's so high tech...&quot; Guy said, taking note of sensors for breathing, heart rate, even routine efficiency on one of the machines control pads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah. I like everything I use to be top of the line. If my body is doing something, I want it calculated, and I want to know how to improve on it for better results.&quot; He smiled and flexed a bit. &quot;Guys think that I take roids to get my body into this kind of shape, but it's all natural. I'm just very scientific about my workouts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy looked him over. He'd assumed that Cray was taking a few things to bulk up, actually. If what he said was true, Cray had the biggest natural physique Guy had ever seen on a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can I get you a drink before we start?&quot; Cray said heading into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sure. That'd be great!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cray came back and handed him a tall glass of icy cold fruit juice. Guy gulped it down. &quot;Ahh...alright... I think I'm ready. Let's lose this belly.&quot; Cray smiled and brought him to the bench press.<br />
<br />
Guy started his set when he began to feel woozy. His arms felt like rubber bands, and he had a hard time holding the bar. He felt it fall, but saw Cray grasp it, then, blackness.<br />
<br />
------<br />
He awoke sometime later, groggy. He tried to sit up and found it impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guh...w..what's going on...?&quot; He said, woozily. Soon the fog cleared and he was able to focus. He found it impossible to sit up because his arms were tied to the bed. He was propped up at a slight angle. He could see his feet tied as well. Not only that... he'd grown. Another 30 or so pounds had returned to him while he slept.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, finally awake. I was waiting for you.&quot; He heard Cray speak, seeing him standing in the doorway. &quot;Looks like we can start having fun.&quot; He grinned as he walked in and patted Guy's belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing? Why am I tied up?&quot; Guy asked, struggling a bit.<br />
<br />
Cray pulled his bag from Mr. Yuan's store up onto the bed. &quot;I've been going to Mr. Yuan's for a while. I only ever bought the muscle ache cream, and I always kind of wondered if the other crazy stuff he sold would work. When I saw you there today, chubby, I figured you might have sampled something and saw the results, because no matter what little story you make up about your weight, you only gained that paunch this week. I saw you as I was leaving the gym last week and you still had your abs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy gulped. Cray took a jar out of the bag. &quot;So I decided to test it. I put one of my sleeping pills in your drink, and when you dozed off, I wiped some of this...fattening cream on you. Fast acting, stuff, too. Your gut swelled up quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...what... you want to see me with a bit more meat on my bones? Is that it?&quot; Guy asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of. You see, I like my guys a certain way... and when I saw you chubbier today, all I could think of is how much I'd like to give you the kind of body I like on a man. Starting... with this...&quot; Cray said as he began to rub Guy's cock. The chubby, one time bodybuilder squirmed as Cray began to stroke it. Guy's cock swelling and hardening to it's full potential. Cray pulled out a tape measure and went from base to tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... 10 inches. Someone sure is gifted.&quot; Cray said with a smile. &quot;Nice big balls too...&quot; Guy flushed. He was rather...lucky in that regard. &quot;Well that's the first thing to change.&quot; He said as he grabbed a jar. Guy squirmed again. &quot;Ch..change how?&quot; Cray smirked and pulled on a glove, scooped some lotion into his hand and started to smooth if over Guy's cock. Guy watched in horror as it began to shrink. He could see the tip retracting, but the entire thing was still hard. It shrank with every new coat of the lotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;H..hey! Stop!&quot; Guy said trying to move away, but Cray just slathered more on. His 10 inches was down to 5...4... his belly obscured it, but Cray kept applying more. &quot;Ah...just right... you won't get to use it with me anyway.&quot; He said with a laugh as he held a hand mirror in front of it for Guy to see. His dick was a hard nub, standing 2 or less inches out from his groin, above his balls, shrunken to a quarter their old size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next step...&quot; Cray said as he poked Guy's belly. &quot;Gotta get you nice and plump. I like my men huge... mostly.&quot; He said with a snicker as he rubbed the tip of Guy's minuscule manhood. He put on a new glove and grabbed another jar. The wet lotion splatting on Guy's belly, Cray massaging it in. Guy began to inflate. His stomach rose in front of him, his chest and arms thickening. He grew bulkier and bulkier, his belly taut and round in front of him. His limbs rounding out, looking somehow stronger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... seems like those muscles under that flab are making you look like a power-lifter...&quot; Cray said, frowning a little. &quot;I don't like the power-lifter look. I like my guys soft and jiggly... Good thing I bought this stuff.&quot; He said searching for another cream. &quot;It'll make those muscles like they never existed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No, you can't get rid of my muscles!&quot; Guy said, starting to panic. Cray laughed &quot;Sure I can. Say bye bye muscles.&quot; He smirked and started to slather the cream all over Guy. His muscles began to deflate. His bulky frame started to change. Angles softened, things weren't as hard and firm. His pecs started to sag and crease over his belly, which itself was changing shape. It didn't stick out as far. It started to hang more, touching the tip of his cock. He soon had a roll under his arms where his tits folded over. He could feel his face fattening up as well...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah perfect. You look like you've never even seen a gym now.&quot; He said with a smile. &quot;Back to fattening you up.&quot; Guy tried to struggle again, but now the restraints seemed even stronger. He could feel himself jiggling with every motion. More of the cold lotion slapped onto his skin, and he could feel his body begin to change once more.<br />
<br />
As his tits and belly expanded, pressing into each other, rolls forming on his sides, he could feel his thighs starting to touch. &quot;Ugh...how...how big do you like your guys...&quot; He winced a little as the weight gain caused a few stretch marks on his belly. Cray licked his lips a bit and rubbed in more lotion. &quot;Oh...very big... You're gonna have a bit of difficulty getting around when I'm done...&quot;<br />
<br />
Cray applied some lotion to Guy's crotch, just to watch the fat swell up and swallow what was left of his cock. Guy moaned as his face got rounder and fleshier, his tits resting heavier on his expanding gut, his ass widening. He could feel the restraints tightening around his wrists and ankles. Cray sat back and watched as the once lean young bodybuilder inflated fatter and fatter, easily passing 500 pounds and continuing on upward. His belly was getting close to reaching his knees, and his fat arms were probably as big as Cray's waist.<br />
<br />
He stopped swelling at just over 700 pounds. Cray grinned at his handiwork, giving Guy's enormous belly a playful shake, watching the ripples cascade across his whole body. Thighs, arms, gut, tits, all shook and jiggled, even his second chin and fat cheeks. &quot;So, you horny, fat-ass?&quot; Cray said with a smirk, he said slipping out of his shirt and boxers.<br />
<br />
Guy looked over the impressive physique as his huge muscles tensed and relaxed, and a cock that rivaled Guy's old one flopped out. Guy stuttered. He was trapped in a massively obese body, but...Cray was still hot. He couldn't pretend he didn't want to. He nodded, feeling his fat chin shake. Cray grinned and climbed on the bed, undoing the restraints. He heaved the fat-boy over onto his gut; no easy feat at his new impressive size. A bit of lube, and he was cleaving that fat ass with his meat. Cray groaned as he pushed in, the fat caressing his shaft. He began to pump, watching his fat-boy quake.<br />
<br />
Guy moaned as his body shook and jiggled, the pudge encasing his dick rubbing and seemingly stroking it. Cray lifted him up from behind, grabbing a fistful of tit, his hard abs casually impacting Guy's soft back. Guy was starting to pant and sweat from just holding himself upright in Cray's grasp. His cock was twitching, aching to release. Cray was grunting and moaning. He pumped harder, deeper, and finally shot his load, filling Guy up. He pulled out and let the fat-ass flop forward onto the bed, causing it to groan and shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah...that was fun... looks like were all finished here.&quot; Cray said with a smirk. &quot;But we're not finished now are we? What do you say Guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More! More!&quot; Guy complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cray rolled guy on to his fat ass. He took a jar and started smothering something all over his own body. Soon he was just as fat as guy. He climbed on to the bed witch completely broke from their combined weights. For the next two hours they had sex.<br />
<br />
At the end their both so hungry they both get dressed again and head out to a buffet right across the street. When their they took the seats closest to the buffet tables. Before they go get ready to be stuff themselves silly, Dray had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea. How about we have a contest to see who can eat the most?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome idea! On your marks! Get set! GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
They both raced to the tables. It was a courageous battle. If one would pile their plate 1 ft high. The other would pile their plate 2 ft high. If one went to the bar, the other would go to the bar. Finished with their last plate or not. It became so serious that they both...</p>
