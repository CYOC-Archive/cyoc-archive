<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marty held out his hand. I was not in a position to argue.<br />
He took the wallet and looked inside. Impressed with what he saw. He smiled. &#39;Our lucky day...………. &#39;Go on get out of here. I parked the car around the corner in Munroe street. near the Royal. Take these keys then come back and pick me up from the alley out back&#39;<br />
<br />
I had no shoes on. Tammra had come in 4 inch heels. I knew I could not possibly walk in them but I had to get out of here. I sat on the edge of the bed and put them on. They made me taller. I took one step and tripped. Walking in heels was difficult.<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t worry. I suppose this is your first hit. It get&#39;s easier&#39; He thought I was nervous, in shock.  I gave a nervous giggle and turned to the door again.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wait&#39; said Marty. &#39;Don&#39;t forget your bag. Make sure nothing of yours is left behind&#39; He lifted the handbag I had left on the bed. &#39;I suppose Manetti never paid you for services rendered. Here take this&#39; He took a few notes from the wallet and thrust them into the handbag. &#39;Actually have some more. Maybe we can meet up later&#39; He put a few more notes into the bag. Treat that as a down payment......Shut the door as you leave&#39;<br />
<br />
He was treating me like the prostitute Tammra was. I left as quickly as I could. Making sure I kept my balance as I walked to the door. I was acutely aware of Marty gawking at my wobbling bum. <br />
<br />
Once outside and with the door shut. I took off the shoes before hurrying out to the street. We were in a industrial area and no-one was about on a Friday night. I had to get out of here. Away from this place. I learned that hurrying and pencil skirts did not mix. Even without the heels my steps were limited to about 15 inches. <br />
<br />
I considered making a run for it. As Donnie I had planned to leave the state and take on a new identity. I guess I already had a new identity. I couldn&#39;t figure out what had happened. Why had I and Tammy switched bodies? I guess it was lucky for me that we did. Not so lucky for Tammy though. The thought crossed my mind that she had led Marty to me. Unfortunately that made sense. It was stupid of me to call one of Big Paul&#39;s girls. A stupid mistake that could of cost me my life. Well I suppose it did cost Marty&#39;s life. <br />
<br />
I thought about heading towards the city, the opposite direction to where Marty had said his car was. If I ran Marty would come looking for me and I couldn&#39;t run in this outfit anyway. I decided to get Marty&#39;s car. He had given me his keys. I could be 500 k&#39;s away by morning. So I walked to Munroe Street. I was so slow in this dress and the stones on the road hurt my feet. I tried putting the shoes on but that made me even slower. I just did not have the technique. I took them off again. <br />
<br />
It took me 5 minutes to walk the 150 metres to Munroe Street. There were other people about here. A pub was just around the corner. There was a blue Ford parked on the other side of the road. I guess that was Marty&#39;s car. I fumbled in the dark for Marty&#39;s car key I had thrown in the bag. I guess the first set of keys must have been Tammy&#39;s as none were a car key. How did Tammy get here anyway?<br />
<br />
I fumbled in the bag and found a second set of keys. These had a car key and sure enough the blue cars lights flashed as I pushed the button. It was Marty&#39;s. I made my way to it and opened the door. It took me another minute to adjust the seat and the mirrors so I could actually see. I was a lot shorter than Marty.<br />
<br />
I turned the keys and the car and did a big kangaroo hop before it stalled. It was a manual. I hadn&#39;t noticed in the dark.<br />
<br />
As I was about to have a second attempt the door opened. it was Marty &#39;Move over I&#39;ll drive&#39; he said physically picking me up and throwing me into the passenger seat. He was very strong. &#39;We have to leave quickly. The room will go up in another minute&#39; Before I knew it we were on our way. &#39;Put the seatbelt on. We don&#39;t want to attract police attention&#39;<br />
<br />
I sat there silently as Marty drove in the opposite direction to what I expected. After 5 minutes we turned left then 5 minutes later left again. It took us 20 minutes to make the journey that should have taken 5. <br />
<br />
Marty dropped me off outside an apartment building. It was just around the corner from Big Paul&#39;s office, the Italian restaurant that was the respectable front of his business. &#39;Maybe we will catch up tomorrow&#39; he said before driving off. <br />
<br />
I was left outside the apartment block not knowing which apartment was Tammy&#39;s. I didn&#39;t know what to do. Then it dawned on me to check in the handbag I had draped over my shoulder. I certainly didn&#39;t want to stand out by the street looking like I currently did.<br />
<br />
I put my shoes back on and slowly made my way to the lit up apartment blocks main entry. There I quickly found the keys I had mistakenly found earlier. Sure enough the 2nd key I tried let me into a lobby area. There I sat on a couch and studied the contents of my handbag. It took a minute but eventually I found an address written on an envelope. &#39;Miss T Smith Unit 23. 154 Minero Rd&#39; The unit block was on Minero Rd. I guess Smith must be my surname. Unit 23 was worth a try.<br />
<br />
I guessed that was on the second floor and sure enough it was. A key fitted into the lock and allowed me entry.  I shut the door behind me and put a chain on the door. I needed to be alone and contemplate my predicament.<br />
<br />
I took off the heels and sat on the couch and took a few deep breaths. I looked around. I was in a small lounge with an attached kitchen There was a hallway with three additional doors off it. Tentatively I went to instigate. The first door was to a bathroom. There was a large mirror and in it a blonde girl with messy hair was staring back at me. Tammy.<br />
<br />
The second door was to a bedroom. In it was a queen sized bed. There were built in wardrobes along one wall. The third door led to a room in which there was a desk and piles of boxes. I was relieved that Tammy did not share the unit. Or did she? I returned to the bedroom and opened the cupboard doors. They were filled with woman&#39;s clothes, both sides of the wardrobe. No signs that a man lived here.<br />
To double check I went to the bathroom. It was very neat and only one toothbrush was by the sink. The cupboards were filled with female toiletries and make-up. No sign of a man&#39;s razor.<br />
<br />
I began to relax. Just a little. Then I saw my reflection in the mirror again. How did this happen? What was I going to do?</p>
