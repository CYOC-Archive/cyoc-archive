<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the harness straps seem to tighten, Eric suddenly realized he was still fully clothed, and changing into a horse would be a very painful experience.  Scrambling quickly, he pulled off his shirt and undid his belt, which was already almost too tight too release.  Fingers were getting stiff, and though he manages to push down his pants and undershorts, he was too late to save his sneakers and socks.  The expensive running shoes tore apart as his feet spread out into dark, rigid hooves.  He focused back on his transformation, annoyed that he had missed a good deal of change in the panic to strip.  His face was already pushed out halfway to a muzzle, and he realized that the walls were closing in and getting shorter.<br />
<br />
No, he was getting larger.  Much, much larger.  Eric&#39;s chest broadened and expanded outward as his shoulders dropped and changed.  Balance was quickly shifting, and he staggered back just in time to fall forward onto thick, sturdy forelegs with a grunt.  The jolt startled him, and he felt confused.  The stall was still lower to him than it had been when he was standing as a human, and now he was down on four legs.  Muscles pulled, and his sense of mass and strength was amazing!  Eric had been fairly small and slender for his age - now he felt massive and powerful.  <br />
<br />
The physical changes slowed, and finally stopped.  The former boy twisted his head around, finding it easier to get used to almost 360-degree vision and the distortions of equine eyesight.  This stall was not really big enough for him, but he could move around enough to inspect himself.  The new muscles of a tail pulled and he flicked the long, heavy growth of hair.  He could make his skin twitch, move his ears.  Then he remembered why he had tried this in the first place, and struggled to get his head down low enough to inspect his genitals.  He felt strange down there, and in his rump.  The stallion&#39;s equipment did not feel heavy or even hanging like Jared&#39;s.  He definitely felt some sexual desire, but it felt deeper inside.  And why did his rump feel so warm and damp?<br />
<br />
The tight stall prevented him from getting a look, but it was hard to get frustrated as something...  different started to drift over his thoughts.  His massive physical changes should have him excited, maybe even scared.  Yet as he stood there, Eric realized he was calming down, oddly accepting of this totally new body.  Wait.  What had Jared said?  The horse mind came with the body!  Jasper the horse had merged with, maybe even taken over Jared&#39;s human thoughts - except - Jared had said it was still him - he had become Jasper.  It wasn&#39;t that the horse had taken over - Jared&#39;s human thoughts and memories had become Jasper&#39;s.  Not all the way, but enough hat Jared felt totally comfortable and content as Jasper.  <br />
<br />
Eric struggled a little, starting to feel a little nervous about this.  He wanted to play at being a stallion, not spend the rest of his life as one.   Stallions.  He liked stallions, big, heavy, powerful, providing satisfaction for the need inside her.  Her?  Eric had a sudden memory of being covered by stallions, the thick prod driving deep, the feel of the stallion on her back and teeth clamping on her neck, the pain/pleasure of mating.  The intense memories should have been startling, but Eric understood now that he had become a mare.  A draft horse used for pulling wagons and plows, a glossy black Clydesdale named Bonnie.  No, that was wrong.  He was Eric!  But..  Eric was a pale, scrawny human male.  <br />
<br />
The huge Clydesdale shook her head and snorted, confused by strange thoughts.  Eric&#39;s thoughts and personality were altering rapidly, the powerful needs and physical presence of Bonnie easily overwhelming and replacing the boy&#39;s essence.  Even though he/she still understood what was happening, Eric/Bonnie was more curious that scared, and offered little resistance.  And even that small concerns faded as Eric completed the transformation into Bonnie.  She snuffled the stall gate and walls, looking for something to eat or water.  When none could be found, she kicked the back of her stall in annoyance, causing a loud thud.<br />
<br />
A few more bangs finally got the attention of the older human male.  Mr. Marshall, a small corner of the mare&#39;s brain added.  He came into the stable and made a beeline for Jasper&#39;s stall, peering in and looking puzzled at the young stallion who was still rocking and humping to pleasure himself.  It took another bang from Bonnie&#39;s hind hoof to bring the human to her.  His mouth fell open and his eyes grew wide when he saw her.  &quot;Not again!&quot;  He opened the stall gate and looked down, then pushed her back so he could pick up a shiny metal object and some clothing.  He stared up and shook his head.  &quot;You fool kids!  This isn&#39;t a toy, and being turned into an animal is sure no game.  You must be Eric.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Bonnie snuffled at the human and nuzzled him, the scent bringing back memories of a younger version of the human playing with her when she was a foal, training her with wagons and harnesses, riding her, helping her with her first breed, her first foal.  There were years of memories, of care and love.  And pain.  Pain in her gut, her belly, with him pressed against her, crying as another human pushed a long needle into her chest and then everything wen dark.  The memories confused her again, but the human reached up to stroke her neck.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve missed you, girl.  Having you put down was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever done in my life, but the vet couldn&#39;t save you and you were in pain.  Damned colic.&quot;  He blinked away new tears and moved around Bonnie, checking her over.  &quot;You couldn&#39;t have picked a better horse to become, Eric.  Bonnie was eight, and already had two beautiful offspring.  One of the most beautiful Clydes I&#39;ve ever seen, and smart and friendly.&quot;  He finished back in front of her again, and she rubbed her chin on his shoulder.  This was her favorite human, and it made her happy to please him.  Even though the part of her mind that was still Eric knew the affection was all the horse&#39;s, the emotion was so positive and pleasant that he just accepted it.<br />
<br />
Mr. Marshall sighed and opened the gate.  &quot;Let&#39;s get you changed back.&quot;  Bonnie obediently followed him out into the stable.  The man looked her over admiringly.  &quot;Well, maybe I&#39;ll groom you good so you can enjoy the body some more.  You didn&#39;t turn into a horse just to be one for ten minutes.&quot;  He headed for the far end of the stable, and Bonnie plodded behind, already knowing where to go.  As he opened the gate of the large stall, she walked in and turned.  It smelled old but clean.  Her stall.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  The change is really complete!&quot;  Stay here, girl.  I&#39;ll get you some water.&quot;  Mr. Marshall grabbed a bucket and then grinned and opened a long-closed drawer in tack room desk.  A bag of starlight mints was inside, and he grabbed a handful.  After filling the bucket, he returned to the stall and hung it on the hook.  Bonnie smelled the familiar odor of peppermint and nosed at his pocket with a whicker.  The man chuckled.  &quot;It&#39;s you. all right.&quot;  He unwrapped mints and fed them to her one at a time.  The flavor was wonderful!  He groomed her then, brushing out her mane, her coat, her tail, and picking out her hooves.  This was pure contentment, and it settled all of Bonnie/Eric into total acceptance.<br />
<br />
Mr. Marshall stayed with her a while, leaning against her shoulder and rubbing her neck.  &quot;I still have your papers, you know.  Be nice to get some more champion foals.&quot;  He frowned to himself.  &quot;It would be wrong to keep you stuck as a horse against your will.&quot;  Then he looked thoughtful.  &quot;But you changed yourself.  With no one else around.&quot;  He looked up into Bonnie&#39;s warm brown eyes.  &quot;What do you say, girl?  Want to pop a few new babies for me?  You sure are in the mood for a stallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bonnie only vaguely understood what he was saying, but nuzzled him.  Making foals.  Sex.  Yes, Eric had become a horse to try sex.  Something nagged at the back of his/her mind - it took along time to make foals.  What was time?  The mare dismissed the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. You parents would be crazy with worry, unless I told them.  And they&#39;d think I was crazy unless I showed them Jacob.&quot;   he thought some more.  &quot;Jacob is much better as Jasper.  I could probably convince Carl, or do something else with him.  Just one foal!  I could get a stud over here tomorrow, and once you are pregnant you can&#39;t change back.  Maybe a year and a half total for the birth and weaning.&quot;  Mr. Marshall was talking more to himself.  That&#39;s not long at all.  Even a couple of foals wouldn&#39;t take all that long.  And you are happy as a horse, aren&#39;t you , girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
He stayed with her a little while longer, then left, closing the gate and picking up the pile of clothing and the Medallion.  &quot;I&#39;ll put these away for now.  You boys wanted to be horses.  Only fair to give you some time on four hooves.&quot;  He chewed his bottom lip.  &quot;Let&#39;s see how I feel about it in the morning.  And maybe you two will have some different feelings as well.&quot;  He carried the clothes out, shutting off the lights and pulling the door closed.   Bonnie felt relaxed and content - some of her human&#39;s words had worried her a little, but not enough to pull her out of the calm acceptance, the sense of being who and what she was supposed to be, where she was supposed to be. The boy that had been Eric whuffled to herself, lifted her tail to urinate an crap, and then drifted off into a peaceful sleep.</p>
