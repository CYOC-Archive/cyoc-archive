<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Tim, now alone in the woods, weaved and bobbed through the thick forest, making 
his way to Mark's house completely unnoticed. When Tim stood just feet from the wooden 
fence surrounding the home, he stopped and thought about what he was going to do. He 
remembered the Madame Lumina forbade him not to harm another person, but he could 
have fun and scare the living daylights out of people, if he wanted. In a way, Tim did want 
that, but he also felt a new desire within him building to bite or tear Mark limb from limb. 
The urge was primal and Tim realized the animal side was trying to manifest itself, which 
he quickly placed in check. Calmed now, Tim used his new sense of smell and hearing to 
determine where Mark was and what the best route to him would be, while also 
determining if there were multiple people home.</Br>
<Br>Tim took in a deep breath through his nose, filling it with all sorts of scents, but he 
could tell that there was only his and another man's scent. Unknowing if it was Mark's, but 
assuming that it was, Tim moved quickly and jumped clear over the fence. When he 
landed, he did so with a soft thud, landing in thick and uncut grass that had not been 
tended to in a few days. Tim noticed how nice it felt to have the soft grass brushing 
against the thick pads of his feet and poke through the spaces of his clawed toes. Tim 
took in another deep breath, trying to determine where the man he thought was Mark was 
located. The scents being separated quickly in his brain, the information being tabulated, 
Tim knew that Mark was on the second floor directly above him. Tim had a good idea that 
he was in his room, probably playing a video game or something.</Br>
<Br>Tim ran up to the wall, digging his claws into the side of the brick facade and quickly 
climbed to the window. Peering in, taking caution not to be noticed, Tim could see 
perfectly into the dark room and saw that the man's back was turned toward the window, 
which meant that Tim had the element of surprise. Knowing that the opportunity would 
not get any better than what it was, Tim leapt from the wall, through the glass and landed 
with the shards clattering behind him. Immediately, the man leapt from the sofa in fright 
and Tim saw that it was indeed his target, Mark.</Br>
<Br>Tim slowly moved toward Mark, smelling the fear emanate from him and noticed that 
he was not moving. Tim knew his body was locked in fright from the intensity of the new 
scent. Tim growled low, adding to his frightened state, enjoying every moment of it. As 
Tim got closer, the smell changed from fear to arousal and with his enhanced vision, he 
could see that Mark had a bulge in his pants. Tim found it amusing that Mark was 
attracted to him, especially since that meant there was a part of him that was gay. Tim 
knew that he could have fun with this new information when he was back in his human 
form and able to speak, but the animal side wanted to have fun with it now.</Br>
<Br>When Tim was within reach of Mark, who was still statuesque, he started to slowly 
walk around Mark and took in all of the scents that were there. Of course, there was still a 
hint of fear coming from him, since Mark had no idea what this creature would do to him. 
Then there was of course the arousal, which was the dominant smell, until a new and 
stronger one made itself known. It smelled foreign, but invigorating and Tim wondered 
what it was. Taking deep breaths closer to the boy's body, Tim started to find where it was 
coming from. Moving around to the front of Mark, Tim took in another deep breath, with 
his nose nearly touching Mark's red Polo shirt. Now having a better idea, Tim moved down 
to his crotch and found that the smell was strongest there than anywhere else. Tim quickly 
realized that Mark was leaking pre, which only made him smile more inside. Knowing that 
this was as far as he could take it, Tim went to turn away and leave, but a strong hand 
grabbed Tim's furred and muscled forearm. Tim was definitely intrigued, so he turned 
back around and peered into Mark's eyes.</Br>
<Br>There was a look of a deep wanting there, wanting something Tim was unsure if he 
could give him. It was primal in desire, animalistic and sexual at the same time. More and 
more interested, Tim decided to let things play out, so he just stood there and gave 
indication for Mark to do what he wanted. In this, Tim was not breaking the rule, he wasn't 
doing anything to anyone, since Mark was doing it all instead. Mark stepped in closer to 
Tim, brushing the thick and reddish dark brown fur, like Tim was being petted. A low murr 
came from Tim, which even he did not expect, because it just felt so damned good. 
Wanting more than just fur, Mark moved to undo the clothing to see the werewolf before 
him completely, and able to see what was really there. In unclothing the werewolf, Mark 
found it was difficult because the clothes were extremely taught around the bulkiness of 
his body. Knowing that there was only one way to do this, Mark tore the clothing off, 
which was easy since it was close to tearing away on it's own. Tim's fur and larger muscles 
now exposed, Mark went for the pants to see what was hidden down there. Again, Mark 
had to tear the clothes off, both the pants and boxers off but Mark quickly discovered it 
was worth it. Tim, the werewolf's package, was a long seven and a half inches long and as 
thick as a beer can, which surprised even Tim when he looked. Wanting to feel something 
that impressive, Mark grabbed the thick shaft and his eyes went wide. Not only was it real, 
it was shocking to Mark and he wanted what the werewolf had. Knowing that it took the 
genes of a werewolf to mix with another persons, Mark dropped to his knees and grasped 
Tim's leaking cock, getting pre covering Mark's hand. Knowing this was a sure way, Mark 
licked the fluid free from his hand and could already feel a difference in his body.</Br>
<Br>Tim, enjoying what Mark was doing, thought it was all in vain. Tim could sense that 
Mark wanted to be a werewolf too, especially doing what he did, but he thought that the 
only thing Mark was going to do was get a load of cream like he apparently wanted. Little 
did Tim know, the pendant didn't just make him look like a werewolf, it actually changed 
his DNA from a double-helix ladder structure, to a triple helix for the two different sets of 
genetic instructions. The tingles Tim felt previously were genetic instructions to activate 
dormant genes within the human body, triggering the development of the third helix. 
What Mark had done and what Tim allowed him to do, set off a chain of events that started 
to change Mark into a werewolf like he desired. Now the question was, what would happen 
next to the both of them?</Br></p>
