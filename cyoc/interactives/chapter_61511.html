<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty figured he'd head to the park first.  He could easily kill a few hours watching (and messing with) people <br />
there.  After that, maybe he could meet up with Jake at the school after his practice ended and they could <br />
take a bus out to the mall. Ty could use that gift card to get a new video game; something he and Jake could <br />
both play, he seriously owed his friend for remembering his birthday.<br />
<br />
It also wouldn't hurt to buy some new clothes.  It was nice out today, and his shorts were still alright. But <br />
when he'd dressed that morning for yard work, his pants were DEFINITELY too short. And he doubted that wish <br />
he'd made was done with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of..&quot; Ty mumbled to himself, quickly detouring from the park entrance to hit up a food vendor.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is ridiculous.&quot; He complained after scarfing down a hot-dog.  &quot;If I'd known that wish would make me <br />
hungry all the time, I'd have just wished to look older or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; he mused, &quot;I only seem to be growing if I have enough food for it, and its definitely slow enough to <br />
look natural...&quot; he looked down, &quot;if weirdly fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty figured it was worth it, though.  If it looked like he was growing naturally, it'd REALLY get to Dustin and <br />
his parents.  Watching their faces as he caught and totally outgrew the creep would completely beat out <br />
anything they would do if he just wished himself big.<br />
<br />
Plopping himself down on a bench, Ty absently scratched himself on the chest as he looked around the crowded <br />
park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets see...sunbathers over that way, two basketball games going, carousel full of little kids, burger <br />
vendor...No!&quot; Ty slapped his stomach.  &quot;Food later.  Fun now.  Hmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha!&quot; Ty grinned as he spotted his first entertainment for the morning.<br />
<br />
One of the caged tennis courts was full of kids.  They looked about ten years old.  Some of their parents had <br />
taken the net down and they were split into two teams, playing dodge-ball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I can have fun with this.  And maybe try out some more complicated wishing.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was, of course, another reason to come here. Ty still had no idea what this wishing thing was all about.  <br />
It was awesome, sure, but what were the limits?  Were there any?  And how complicated could he make his <br />
wishes, or were simple ones better?<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets find out.&quot;  Ty nodded resolutely, pointing toward the cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish...lets see...that every time someone gets hit, they turn bright pink for a minute, but that nobody <br />
really cares.  Every time someone dodges they get a lot bigger so they're easier to hit, but that it wears off <br />
after the game, and nobody cares.  Anyone playing dirty will become so bouncy that they'll bounce right out of <br />
the cage, then become normal.  And I wish all the parents were kids for this game so they could play too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly a whole lot of strange things started happening on the tennis court.  All of the parents that were <br />
watching their kids suddenly seemed to shrink, their clothes forming big tenting piles over them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish they had kids clothes on under there!&quot;  Ty quickly wished.<br />
<br />
The kids on the court all cheered as a whole bunch of new friends ran out from under the big clothes and the <br />
dodge-balls started flying.  Without adult supervision, a lot more kids than normal tried to play rough, so Ty <br />
quickly made a game of counting all the children bouncing thirty feet into the air to land outside the court.  <br />
<br />
Several of the children dodged the ball speeding toward them, only to suddenly grow to double their normal <br />
height.  Ty figured that made them eight times their normal size and weight.  Most of those 'big kids' quickly <br />
turned bright pink and walked sulkily off the court, but one or two stayed in the game, and one even managed <br />
to dodge again, and was suddenly so big he could touch the top of the thirty foot court fence just by reaching <br />
up.  He was then hit easily, but didn't seem too upset.  He just grinned and started stomping around the other <br />
court, making the ground shake and throwing all the kids on their butts.  A lot of kids turned pink around <br />
then.<br />
<br />
Ty just laughed.  Not only was that REALLY funny to watch, but it was also helping him learn more about his <br />
power. Like how the giant kids didn't shrink after THEY were out of the game, but would stay huge until the <br />
whole game stopped.  He also hadn't said they could only grow once, so he got things like the super-jumbo kid <br />
that was cracking up the asphalt.  He made a mental not to fix that; it was technically his fault after all.<br />
<br />
Still laughing at the bizarre game that it seemed only he could notice and enjoy, Ty made a quick wish for <br />
some extra cash and headed off to get acquainted with a burger or three.  As he walked, he noticed a very <br />
slight touch on his toes.  His feet had hit the tips of his shoes.  He always got new shoes about a size <br />
larger than he needed (Growing room, said June.  Cheap, said Ty), and the shoes weren't exactly new. But the <br />
sudden change meant he'd completely grown into them since that morning. A trip to the mall later was <br />
definitely a good idea.</p>
