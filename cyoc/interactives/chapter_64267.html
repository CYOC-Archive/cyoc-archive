<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Well my husband, son, and daughter have been kidnapped and will be killed," 
Christine said barely getting the words out.</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?" you asked mentally going through a list of possible 
supernatural suspects.</p>
<p>Instead of answering Christine pulls out a DVD from her purse and hands it to you. 
The moment Rusty saw the DVD he closed the blinds and locked the door. You put 
the DVD in and it started playing. The first thing you saw was a girl who appeared to 
be 10, a boy who appeared to be 15, and a man who appeared to be in his early to 
middle forties. All of them were completely naked and chained to poles. The camera 
panned back from them to reveal 13 hooded figures outside of a circle. There were 
symbols around the circle and your heart skipped several beats as you recognized 
them. It had been about 15 years since you last saw them when you were a nine year 
old boy and your babysitter decided she wanted a little sister. You put that thought 
aside for now as the camera zoomed back in on the boy and man then the chanting 
started. The audio had been run through a synthesizer so none of the voices were 
recognizable as human but the words were clearly heard. You doubted if Christine 
knew what the chant was being in another language but she probably had some idea if 
she already saw the video. At first nothing seemed to happen then they got a pained 
look on their faces. You knew their bodies were starting to change. They were 
probably in more pain then you were at the same point since their bodies were 
changing more than your's did. You could see them shrink a bit and lose muscle mass. 
Their bodies took on a more feminine appearance as body hair fell out. Their skin 
became noticeably softer and their hair grew longer. The man's hair grew down to just 
past the shoulders while the boy's grew down to his hips. Both of their waists slimmed 
while their hips expanded out which caused them to scream for the first time their 
voices getting higher as their Adams Apples shrank. Their faces became more oval as 
their cheek bones became higher. Then the final changes started to happen. Their 
aureola and nipples became a bit larger and flesh started piling up under their nipples 
forming breasts which grew until they were DDDs or even Gs. You were glad that 
Alicia had turned you into a girl at nine so you developed your C cup breasts naturally. 
You didn't want to know how heavy the breasts the man and boy were sporting now 
were. Their butts had also swollen up until they were huge ghetto booties. You had a 
feeling the robed figures were directing this part of the transformation since they were 
chanting words Alicia didn't use with you. And now came the most painful part which 
the camera zoomed in on as much as possible while keeping both in view. Their dicks 
and ball sacks were turning white as their screams became louder. You had wanted to 
stop the video but you knew you had to see all of it in case they put some sort of 
reality filter on the transformations. Their dicks and ball sacks turned gray, then black, 
then fell off leaving smooth skin behind. The last bit of transformation was the area 
between their legs turned red and split forming their new female genitals.</p>
<p>The camera panned out again as the chanting stopped and the two new females 
went limp with exhaustion. A voice that you couldn't tell if it was male or female came 
on and said, "Give us what we want and we will restore them. Don't and they'll be 
burned at the stake one each day starting with the oldest. You have five days before 
the burnings begin." And there the video ended after an hour.</p>
<p>You turned around to face Christine as she asked, "Will you help me?"</p>
<p>"I'll take the case," you said nodding. "Though I need to know if you have any idea 
what they want." You opened yourself up to detect any lie she might tell.</p>
<p>Christine shook her head and said, "I have no idea what they could want."</p>
<p>"Where was the last place you know they were?" you asked wondering if maybe 
this was a case of mistaken identity or something.</p>
<p>"They were at the airport in Chicago waiting for a connecting flight," Christine said 
tears running down her cheeks. "We were going to vacation in Hawaii but I had 
another day of work. Instead of having the kid's vacation cut a day short Donald took 
them to start and I was to meet up with them. Their plane had some mechanical 
problems so they were going to go eat and maybe do a little sightseeing."</p>
<p>"When did the video show up?" you asked hoping it wasn't already too late.</p>
<p>"It was outside the door this morning," Christine said sniffing. "Please tell me you 
can get to them in time and turn them back."</p>
<p>"I'll do everything in my power to get to them in time," you promised taking hold of 
one of her hands. "I was burned at the stake in a past life and it was a horrible 
experience. One that I don't want anyone else to go through. Now about changing 
them back. If we can gather enough witches who are strong enough then I'm confident 
that we can change them back. They didn't put any reality filters on them which would 
have made it a lot more difficult."</p>
<p>"Oh thank you," Christine said relief evident in her voice.</p>
<p>"I hate to do this but I do need to tell you about my rates," you said grimacing 
inwardly. "I charge $70 an hour plus any extraordinary expenses. You'll be billed when 
the investigation is over. If you can not pay the lump sum then we can work out a 
payment schedule. Do you still want me to take the case?"</p>
<p>"I'd pay you a thousand dollars an hour to get my family back," Christine said with 
absolute conviction.</p>
<p>You turned to Rusty to ask him how long of a drive you had but he already had 
the answer saying, "It will take about 13 or 14 hours."</p>
<p>"Then get Christine's information and get ready to go on a road trip," you said 
getting up from your chair. "I'm sorry to rush out but we need all the time we can get. 
Do you have recent photos of them with you?"</p>
<p>"Right here," Christine said reaching into her purse and pulling out three photos.
</p>
<p>You left Rusty to take Christine's information as you hurried upstairs. Once there 
you stripped out of everything but your bra and panties and put on some more 
comfortable travel clothes. These included a white tee with pink roses on them, a pair 
of the new Pajama Jeans, and a pair of flat sandals. You already had a couple bags 
packed and ready to go at a moment's notice along with a few dresses and high heels 
in garment bags. You went to your dresser and took out the gun you kept there. Both 
you and Rusty were licensed to carry guns but you didn't use ordinary bullets in them. 
Instead you used paint bullets like the military used in war games only these had a 
sleep potion in them instead of paint. Alicia made them for you since you would rather 
not kill anyone. You smiled as you thought about how much Alicia wanted you to be a 
witch. You just didn't get the power that would allow you to be one even though she 
had turned you into a girl and cast a reality filter so you were a part of her family. 
Shaking your head you glance at the gun and the several clips you kept to make sure 
the potions were still effective which your psychic senses told you they were. Next you 
took out a charm bracelet and put it on. The charms on it protected you on more than 
one occasion and you sensed they were still good. A couple of them would need to be 
recharged soon though, probably after this case. You just hoped they wouldn't fail at a 
critical time. You hauled everything downstairs where Rusty was already waiting for 
you and you were glad to see that he had his own gun and charm bracelet on. After 
loading the car up both of you hit the road.</p>
<p>You take turns driving and while Rusty was driving you looked at a map of 
Chicago and surrounding areas and made mental notes of where the supernatural 
might be. Your radar would get better as you got closer to the city which would either 
narrow down the number of places or expand them.</p>
<p>After the long hours in the car you finally arrive at the Chicago airport. The first 
order of business was to find out if Mr. Atwell and his children made the connecting 
flight. After showing your license and explaining you were on a case you found out 
that they apparently didn't board the plane. With that taken care of you drove to the 
hotel you had booked on the way and checked in. It was late at night so you both went 
up to your rooms to get some rest. Tomorrow was likely to be a busy day.</p></p>
