<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Miss Angie’s grin widened, she decided she had the perfect plan for the two friends that would ensure they would never have to bid each other farewell. “Well, you see girls, our two ponies here have had a little bit of a crush on each other for a while. They just don’t quite know how to tell each other!” Miss Angie beamed, and the girls understood immediately how their ponies felt. Olivia chimed in, “Let’s help them out! They would be so happy if they both knew!” Miss Angie nodded thoughtfully, tapping her chin as she considered the girl’s words carefully. “The best way to do that is to show them what to do. Do you two think you’re willing to help me?” The witch asked, looking expectantly at the two friends. “Of course we will!!” They both cheered. “How are we supposed to do that?” Miss Angie walked closer to the two friends. “Well, ponies talk a little differently than we do. First you’ll both need to get on the ground, like a pony.” She instructed. The girls smiled excitedly and played along, carefully getting on their hands and knees in the grass next to each other. Lib lifted his head, chewing a mouthful of lush grass as he looked at the two. “I’m going to pretend to be my pony!” Heather said, waggling her butt as if she could swish her luxurious tail in Olivia’s direction. “Okay, then I’ll be Lib!” Said Olivia, ready to commit to the role of stallion. “Wonderful! Usually, when a boy pony is ready to tell a girl pony he really likes her, he goes up and gives her a little kiss on her bottom.” Instructed the witch. The two friends sort of cocked their heads and shrugged, agreeing it was for the greater good, and Olivia pretended to trot behind Heather. Lib watched on, still chewing the grass. “Now Heather, usually when this happens the girl pony let’s the boy pony know she likes him by giving a little whinny. Think you can give it your best shot?” Miss Angie said. Olivia knew this was odd, but also knew she was helping Lib, and trusted Miss Angie. Olivia leaned in closer to Heather’s butt hesitantly and planted a kiss. In response, Heather whinnied as best as she could as she looked over her shoulder at her best friend. “Good job!” Cheered the witch. “Now Olivia, you’re going to give Heather a nice big hug from behind to show her how much you love her, okay?” As Olivia raised herself up to hug her friend, Nadia wandered over. Lib watched the strange act as the gears began to turn in his head. Olivia embraced Heather from behind, giving her a big hug as they both giggled at having the full attention of both ponies. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in Lib’s head, and he trotted over behind Nadia. Between flicks of Nadia’s tail, he spotted something he hadn’t paid attention to before, and his sheath stirred. The stallion leaned in carefully and licked the mare’s plush, leathery folds. His mind was lost to alien feelings the moment his thick tongue made contact with her juices. Nadia whinnied and tensed up quickly, but immediately relaxed. Her eyes were wide, and she looked over her shoulder with fear and confusion at her former sister turned stallion. Lib proved further with his tongue, causing another reaction from Nadia as she spread her legs involuntarily. Lib craved the honey coming from that sweet hole, trying to reach the source as deep as his tongue could go. Nadia clenched, whinnying wildly, as a spray of juices spurted out onto Lib’s face, causing him to pull back and come to his senses. His groin ached painfully, and he craved release. Nadia watched on fearfully, nickering in protest, as Lib followed Olivia’s lead and reared up, landing on the mare’s back in embrace. He thrusted his hips around clumsily, swinging around his giant member, slapping Nadia’s rump a few times as he missed his mark. Miss Angie giggled and stepped forward to grab his penis. Lib huffed and chuffed excitedly as Miss Angie guided the top to his target, and he plunged in with need. Nadia whinnied loudly, but was then locked in place as she lost her virginity to Lib. Lib thrusted wildly, balls taught and slapping Nadia’s rear firmly as he rutted with reckless abandon. His belly churned with passion, never having known he could feel this way before, and now truly understanding why he felt the way he did back in the barn. Nadia, on the other hand, did not feel the same. While she too was lost in passion, she never wanted to lose her virginity to a horse of all things, especially not like this. And she knew the repercussions of sex, unlike Lib. She didn’t want to become pregnant and get stuck here. She wanted to go back to college. She just wanted to go home. <br />
Meanwhile, the two girls were too awestruck to notice their own developments. Their ears had pointed and migrated skywards. “Wow, they must really like each other!” Remarked Olivia, as a tail popped out from the back of her shorts and began to trail to the ground. “Yeah… You know, I was too embarrassed to say before, but I think I really like you…” Heather chimed in, reaching to hold her friends hand as fingers turned to keratin. Olivia turned to embrace her friend in a tight hug, returning her feelings. “Me too, Heather. I don’t ever want to lose you.” As the friends squeezed each other tighter, Heather pulled away as she felt a poking on her belly and looked down. Olivia’s pants were strained to the limit as a miniature horse penis peaked its velvety head out from the waistband of her pants. It was then that she lost her balance fully, falling onto long, furred forelegs as her back legs changed to match. Olivia’s breathing quickened, her posture following suit as her body began to barrel out, increasing in size. Miss Angie snapped her fingers, and their clothes vanished into a sparkling mist. They would have torn to shed ads otherwise. Olivia’s neck lengthened, putting her at eye level with Heather’s rear. She wanted to show her friend how much she loved her, just like Lib. Just like ponies do. Olivia’s breathing deepened as she looked up at the two mating ponies, then back down at her friend, who looked over her shoulder expectantly, breathing heavily, knowing what was coming next. Olivia lifted herself up, landing on Heather’s back. Her member swelled to full size, immediately finding its target. Heather’s face pushed out into a muzzle as her voice changed, and she whinnied out into the meadow air, her lover filling her completely. Olivia’s balls then dropped suddenly, flooding him with testosterone as they swung below him. He tensed with pleasure, his muscles expanding and developing rapidly all over his body, filling him with new feelings. Fur blanketed their bodies as their names cascaded down, Olivia now readjusting his stance and plunging deeper with his newfound strength. Now, the two couples mated in sync with one another. Olivia and Lib ravaged their partners, a shared goal in mind, racing each other to the finish. Below, Heather was lost in a new world of pleasure, and love for her best friend. Now they could be together forever. They could even raise baby ponies together! It was a dream come true. <br />
Finally, Lib pulled as close as he could to Nadia, reaching his breaking point, and began jetting seed into Nadia’s waiting womb. Both horses called out in cries of lust as they gradually came to a stop. Shortly after, Olivia felt his balls pull closer, ready for release, and he did the same to Heather, painting her insides white with foal batter. He wanted to have a family with her, to live here forever with his best friend. As the couples came to a stop.</p>
