<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... I&#39;ll pass. I&#39;m trying to watch my weight.&quot; Cynthia responded.<br />
&quot;Oh well, more me I guess haha.&quot; They both awkwardly laughed and continued to talk the rest of their group. Brooke was mostly just questioned with things like &quot;How did you get so big?&quot; or &quot;What&#39;s in those shakes?&quot; or even &quot;How the hell did you get into that bikini?&quot; It was a full hour until they finally got the beach, in which Brooke already burned through 4 more shakes. Her massive gut blew up by 4 inches at that point and she started to have trouble getting out of her seat. Luckily, Linda managed to pull her out. Unfortunately, the shakes were kicking in and Brooke&#39;s stomach grumbled in defiance of them. A loud fart escaped her butt that lasted a minute and smelled like chocolate and shit. More farts were coming as she was trying to contain them, which only made them worse.<br />
&quot;Oh god that smells awful,&quot; Linda complained, closing her nose and waving the smell away.<br />
&quot;Yeah... *groan* maybe I should lay off the shakes a bit, sorry,&quot; apologized Brooke hunching over grabbing her stomach, releasing another loud fart. &quot;Let&#39;s just get back the group.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup, I need to get away from this smell. My eyes are starting to water.&quot; Linda said rubbing her eyes, still covering her nose. Linda rushed ahead to get away from the smell. Meanwhile Brooke quickly took out another smoothie and popped the top off.<br />
&quot;One more can&#39;t hurt right?&quot; Brooke whispered to herself. She opened her mouth as wide as she could and started to chug the shake. Streams of the thick chocolate mixture dripped all over her. They ran down her chin and started to pool in her boobs. The rest of it ran down her bulbous stomach, getting soaked into her dark bikini, making even darker. She jogged down the wooden stairs, each step bouncing her big tits and bigger belly. Her ass and thighs jiggled with each lift of the leg, all the meanwhile they shook even more from the booming farts coming from her butt. Some lasted from a 3 seconds to 1 minute and the smell was awful as well, like a mixture of old chocolate and hot garbage.Luckily she was pretty far away from her group, so the smell only permeated around her. It was about 5 minutes until she finally met up with her friends, finishing another smoothie after that first one, and it was around 12:30. Lunchtime.<br />
&quot;Boy am I starving!&quot; exclaimed Jesse, digging into her bag to find her 4 cheese calzones. Jesse was the average of the group. Average intelligence, average body size, average social skills, average weight etc., with gold-ish curly hair. The only thing that wasn&#39;t average about her was her appetite. Before Brooke became a fat gassy ball, Jesse was the best eater in her group. She wore teal one piece swimsuit that had the bottom half colored a dark blue with band coming from it that made the straps. It covered up to her tits and most of her back as well, leaving a bit of space so she could devour things without feeling it be so tight. She dug around some more until she found a large tupperware container containing 5 tinfoil-covered crescent shaped meals. She tore the foil off and marveled at it. Still warm, and dripping with grease. She dug right into it, with cheese and sauce bursting out form where she bit. She took 2 more large bites until her mouth was full and looked up. Jesse&#39;s face was smothered with grease and sauce, and the swimsuit covered in flaky crumbs and more sauce. She merely wiped it off, finished up the rest, and went on to the next one.<br />
&quot;So what did you bring Brooke?&quot; Jesse said muffled through the bites of cheese, eyes focused on the calzone.<br />
&quot;Jesse please, at least look up when asking someone a question, or finish chewing you slob,&quot; complained Emma. She was the smartest one of the group, and also the quietest. However she was also the loudest when provoked, going into a blood rushing fit, which took all 6 people to restrain her plus 2 other people at the most. She had straight, mahogany hair, and sported a white bikini with red and orange tropical flower patterns on one of the cups and on the front and back of the bottom piece. She was also pretty flat, barely having  b cups and petite, but a cute ass.<br />
&quot;Fuck you then!&quot; Jesse yelled in defiance, taking a mouthful of calzone, chewing it loudly, and yelling &quot;Like this?&quot;. Everyone laughed except Emma laughed, she just shook her head and sighed while pulling out a container of sushi.<br />
&quot;Meanwhile, I&#39;m just sitting here with a bunch of shakes, and damn are they good,&quot; Brooke said happily slurping down another bottle.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just going to back up slowly now...&quot; said Cynthia, sliding a bit farther away from Brooke, who merely shrugged and continued to chug the bottles. Lunch went on pretty normally, they all talked while Brooke was releasing her farts, disgusting everyone occasionally. After their lunch was over, they all did their own things. Cynthia took her diving gear and started to swim off into the deeper ends, Jesse and Linda were just messing around with the sand, Emma looked for hidden crevices, and Brooke just sat on matching towel under the umbrella drinking more shakes. There were also the 3 other girls, Katherine, Sandra, and Mindy. Katherine was also a pretty average person like Jesse, but without the eating habits. Typical black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin, wearing a purple string bikini and hung with Jesse and Linda. Sandra was the one with the good humor. She had a very tanned skin, brown-blonde hair, and wore a salmon colored plus size bikini, despite being far from fat. She was swimming with Cynthia, watching her look at things underwater. Mindy was the extremely shy one, rarely speaking. Surprisingly, she wore a neon blue sling bikini that matched the rims of her glasses. She napped under a towel, letting her curly red hair get sandy.<br />
&quot;Nnggh...&quot;, Brooke groaned rubbing her massively bloated belly. It was 3:00 already and she was done to her last 5 shakes. Her stomach was as big as a 5 gallon bucket and stretch marks were beginning to form. She pressed down hard on her stomach, only to feel a sharp pain from the tightness and a putrid fart. She was half way done with her smoothie and she wasn&#39;t going to give up. Her hands shaking, she lifted the mug over her mouth and poured out all the contents, most missing and dripped down her body. She tossed the cup to the side and moaned with both pain and pleasure. She suddenly let out a loud, long-lasting, wet fart. It started out as a large booming, but slowly transitioned into a squelching sound. Her face turned bright red as she went attempted to feel her ass. Wetness. She shuddered and tried to stand up, but her stomach weighed her down too much. Brooke looked down and saw her belly sticking far out. She took a deep breath and exhaled. Suddenly, she heard something snap. Looking down, she saw the string holding the 2 cups together torn and her nipples started get hard from feeling the cold breeze. Not only that, but she also heard a rip somewhere in her bikini bottom. She whispered to Emma, who was sitting in her chair reading a book.<br />
&quot;Yes, Brooke, what is... uh...&quot; Emma said glancing over until she saw Brooke basically naked.<br />
She started to turn bright red, then only said,&quot;Uh...&quot;</p>
