<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kimberly flipped the light switch on as she entered her bathroom. Moving in front of her mirror she froze, her hand flying to her mouth in shock as she was finally able to get a full look at herself.<br />
<br />
She guessed she had slipped down in height to about 5&#39;3&quot; now, she hadn&#39;t been this short in years. Her hair had lightened almost completely to blonde at this point. It now looked as if she had several brown highlights in the blonde instead of the other way around. The strands seemed to have lengthened too, with the formerly shoulder length tips reaching down to the middle of her back now. She ran a hand through her new tresses, they felt softer too, as if professionally worked on. Her eyes locked onto her hand as she stroked her hair. The skin seemed smoother, and slightly rosier than before. Her fingers looked slimmer and daintier, with light blue polish slowly covering in each nail. She scratched at the paint that was steadily marching across the nail of her index finger. The bits that flaked off were quickly replaced by more polish.<br />
<br />
Focusing back on her face in the mirror, Kimberly noticed all the amber color had left her eyes. They were now a steely gray color, and a few brighter blue spots seemed to be growing in around the edges of her irises. Her lips were slightly plumper than in the car and a solid red color now. She tried rubbing at them with her finger none of the color came off. It seems they naturally looked as if she was wearing lipstick now. Peering more closely at her face she could see subtle tweaks had been made to her features. Smoother, rosier skin like on her arms, smaller nose, higher cheekbones. Small changes individually, but together they made for a more picturesque and attractive Kimberly than had left her apartment earlier.<br />
<br />
Seeing as the hadn&#39;t had a good look at her torso since the mall, Kimberly eagerly looked for new changes, It didn&#39;t take long  to find them. Her breasts were larger now, only about one size up from her normal B-Cups, but now she knew why the box had felt as though it was pressing against her more in the elevator. Her bra seemed to have grown with her breasts too, changing to a push-up style to show her off even more. She felt fabric growing down from the bottom of the cups, forming a sort of half-slip.<br />
<br />
Looking to her shirt, the neckline had dropped considerably, widening out and showing off her enhanced cleavage .  It was now a solid light blue color, and like her socks had changed to a much softer material. The former band logo had widened and lengthened, encompassing most of the front of the shirt. It now appeared to be an apron edged with lace. As she watched her sleeves shortened slightly, white lace appearing along the cuffs. Slowly, the short sleeves puffed up, becoming rounder and firmer than before. The bottom of the shirt was widening out, becoming more flowy. It had grown longer too, now reaching past the crotch of her pants, with more white lace ringing the hemline. She surmised it would soon be a full dress.<br />
<br />
A slight &quot;oof&quot; of surprise escaped her lips as she felt something cinch firmly around her middle, resulting in small shower of tingling. Looking closer she saw strips of fabric had grown from just below her bustline on the apron, moving around to her back and tying themselves into a graceful bow.<br />
<br />
Peering farther down her form, she saw her jeans had risen to just above her knees. Or they had been her jeans. They had brightened fully to white, the material changing to a silky texture similar to her new dress. Even as she watched, the legs ruffled out further, almost touching each other. They looked like a fluffy pair of bloomers at the moment, though she imagined they would connect with her slip soon enough to become an under-dress to support and enhance her still-forming outer skirt. She turned around to inspect her butt in the mirror. She could see it&#39;s enlarged size was pushing up her skirt even with the bloomers beneath. Kimberly felt it had perked up a bit more from the large expansion in the ride up to her apartment. <br />
<br />
As she inspected her ass, tingles concentrated around her crotch. Her panties, a simple athletic style before, were changing to be made of silk with lace, vibrating as they did so. They tightened up against her ass, becoming more like a thong between her larger cheeks. Once the changes were over they stopped vibrating and she was left panting, her arms bracing against the counter top. It felt so much higher to her than it used to.<br />
<br />
Looking down at her legs, her stockings had continued to rise up. She could feel their soft edges playing around her upper thighs, sensual tingles coming from their pulsing edges. Feeling tightening and ripples of pleasure in her feet she looked to her shoes. They had completely turned into flats at this point, and as she watched she noticed a tiny strap was growing across each one, latching onto the other side of the shoe.<br />
<br />
Appraising her overall look, Kimberly smirked as she realized what, or more precisely who, she was turning into. &quot;Down the Rabbit Hole hhmm?&quot; she said aloud. taking in her softer voice, the prim and proper tone was more prevalent than before. &quot;I suppose there would be no better a way to start such a journey such than as Miss Alice herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pausing for a moment to enjoy pleasurable tingling of her continuing changes, Kimberly turned and headed back into her room. She had some things that needed taking care of.</p>
