<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday was again pure torture for Ken. He still couldn´t move his hands or feet much, his fingers and toes still completely immobile. His mouth and ass felt still as stuffed as before and there was a high pressure on his tongue and cock. Adding the salty taste in his mouth, the light wiggling feeling against his throat and his bladder and the reoccurring pain-circles between his legs and his back, Ken felt completely helpless.<br />
And then there wasn´t anything to distract himself either. All he could think about was his weird dream. Was that somehow real? If it was real, would that mean he had his brother’s feet inside his mouth and ass right now? Even if his brother wasn´t anywhere nearby? And what of the other symptoms? It just made no sense to him. Now, thinking about the feet of his brother, he thought he smelt them as well. Gross.<br />
Ken was sure to phone his brother as soon as he could, but when would that be? Or when would his brother come looking for him?<br />
–<br />
Tommy had his fun at work, otherwise he wouldn´t willingly work on a Sunday. He was sure he would have visited his brother after the experiment with him as a test subject, seeing how he was. There would be a reason why he hadn´t shown up yesterday, but right now that meant little to Tommy, as he had other experiments running.<br />
So it was only hours later, when Tommy made it home, enjoying his afternoon jog between work and home, that he again thought about Ken. Looking down at his sweaty feet, still inside his brother-linked shoes, he thought: “I guess you get a break now, brother.” He slipped out of his shoes, only loosening the laces slightly, but they were still tied into a knot. It was a tick of him, after all, as long as the laces were tied there was a lower chance of them lying around on the ground. Then he placed the shoes in his small shoe cabinet.<br />
With a relaxed sigh Tommy wiggled his toes on the carpet. As much as he wanted Ken to feel his feet and be stuffed, his feet needed some fresh air and free room as well. And he nice, warm bath would be good as well. After all, they had been in the shoes for around thirty-six hours as he had slept in them last night.<br />
Tommy could even smell his feet right now, they reeked. So, his first destination was his bathroom, enjoying said hot bath for his feet. After fifteen minutes he toweled them dry, then got himself something to eat.<br />
–<br />
Ken felt it was getting worse. The salty taste got stronger, and he now could clearly smell reeking feet, making him want to vomit. Not that he had anything inside his stomach to puke out right now. The amount of piss and shit that left him while he laid on his couch in misery had more and more diminished, even as it soiled both his underwear and the couch. But he was in no condition to get to his bathroom.<br />
Then, all of the sudden, something changed. First his fingers and toes could wiggle a bit, even if not much. It also lessened the pressure on his cock and tongue a bit. Next, whatever invaded his ass slowly slipped out, releasing the pressure from his cock completely, but his ass remained wide open and he had a hollow feeling there. Whatever was inside his mouth went next, leaving the same, hollow feeling behind as in his ass. But he could finally close his mouth again.<br />
Ken tried to speak, but as his mouth was bone-dry right now, only a quiet croaking sound left it. “Okay, I need something to drink, and then I call Tommy.” Ken thought as he slowly turned to stand up. His legs still were rather stiff, but he managed to get up after a couple of tries. He got a glass out and filled it with water carefully, as his fingers still could only move minimally.<br />
It took three glasses of water for his mouth and throat to not feel dry anymore. And that didn´t help to get the salty taste out, the water itself tasted like it had been used for a foot-bath. His attempt to speak was still rather unsuccessful, as his voice sounded hoarse. “It will need to be enough when Tommy gets here, but calling him is still out” he thought.<br />
Finding his phone under the table only made matters worse, its battery was empty, needing to be charged first. “Crap” he muttered hoarsely. It would take some time to charge, and he had no landline phone. Normally he charged his phone at night, but that hadn´t been needed two days ago, and yesterday he hadn´t been able to.<br />
After plugging his phone in with some difficulty for his fingers he decided on a shower to get the piss and shit stench away from himself, his underwear had been dropped as soon as he had stood before from the couch. He was rather naked then walking around in that underwear right now.<br />
As stiffly as he moved it took a bit to get the shower running and he couldn´t really enjoy it, either. It didn´t help with the stiffness, he was still tasting feet and smelling them as well, and he was tired from the day as well. The pain had not let him sleep, and a couple of minutes before being woken up again didn´t help.<br />
So, leaving the shower, getting dry and into a new pair of underwear, Ken looked over his phone. He worked half an hour to get a message send to his brother, still not able to speak clear enough to be understandable over the phone.<br />
“T. Help me. Feeling stuffed in mouth and ass, can´t move hands and feet, arms and legs are stiff. Unable to speak clearly, tasting and smelling feet. Reappearing pain in back and legs. Only little better for about an hour. Please help me. K.”<br />
When he got no answer for half an hour, he sighed. What now? Feeling his tiredness, he soon went to bed. Hopeful that his brother could help him in the morning.<br />
Like before, Ken dreamt of being immobile, this time he was in an eternal darkness. Whatever this was, it was just boring, but again he couldn´t wake up, and dreamt of nothing else for the night.<br />
–<br />
Tommy didn´t notice his phone had received a message, as he left it in the kitchen to charge while watching tv. Again, Tommy fell asleep on the couch, never checking his phone that night.</p>
