<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was looking down to a rather large room. It was longer than wide and dimly lit. Across its length a dark red carpet ran down the middle of it. To it&#39;s side rows of statues were carefully placed to its sides. Curiously Ryan walked a few steps down to their level. Getting closer to them he could see that they were made from a variety of materials and shaped like anthropomorphic animals. As he walked down the isle he could see that there was a large stone seat, like a throne on one end, it had no discernible padding yet was decorated with patterns and inlays. Next to it stood a figure of a fox, apparently made of silver with a sculpted rather ornate uniform. Ryan noticed that somehow this room and all of the statues seemed dust free unlike the rest of the cellar.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly a pair of glowing eyes appeared on the fox. &quot;Our king has returned!&quot;, it exclaimed loudly. Two statues sprung into action, they were bears wearing what looked like suits of armor seemingly completely made of a duller silver metal, possibly steel. They grabbed Ryan by the arms. A third one came extended his claws to carefully rip off Ryan&#39;s clothes. Most of the unoccupied statues started to perform a rhythmic chant in some unknown language. Meanwhile a group of others rolled in a stone table. It clearly looked like it could take quite some weight. Suddenly what could best be described as a chocolate brown raccoon woman appeared in front of him. Her clothes didn&#39;t cover much yet gave her a bit of modesty. Her fur was different shades of brown, chocolate brown. In fact she even smelled of chocolate. Suddenly she kissed him wrapping him into a hug and rubbing her tongue against his oozing a seemingly impossible amount of dark chocolate into his mouth. Ryan swallowed as his mouth started to fill up again and again. This clearly excited him as seen by his member being fully erect. After a while she released him and the bears carried him to the table. It was surprisingly warm, but very hard. <br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt strange, his hair started to clump together and he gradually lost features, somehow this excited him even more and he started to cum. However instead of the usual white cum he shot up a hot golden yellow liquid. As it hit his body it left golden spots. Somehow he noticed that touching and spreading that liquid felt incredibly well, so he did covering his whole body in golden cream while shooting out more and more of it. Eventually the melting removed so much of his details causing him to loose his member as well as his fingers and toes. His head was nothing more than a blob as was the rest of his body. He tried to move but he had lost all strength. His body felt completely numb.<br />
<br />
The chanting stopped for a moment and resumed with a noticeably different rhythm. Gradually he regained some shape. It started with his legs which changed into a pair of golden boots with the soles made out of a darker gold alloy. They then rushed upward forming pants, also golden. Around his pelvis the blob extended to form a sort of tail and a sword, as well as a belt to hand it from. A mantle formed on his upper body, open with a sort of  shirt underneath. His arms, under the sleeves noticeably grew and extended into gloved hands. Then she changes reached his head. On top and the back a luxurious sculpted mane grew. His mouth pushed forward and a muzzle formed. It was slightly open so his sharp teeth were visible. All of this was in various shades of golden yellow, apparently made from solid gold and a variety of gold alloys for different shade. On his made a crown started to grow. Gradually more and more details formed, seams started to appear and form individual stitches with sculpted threads. His fur and mane developed individual hairs and he even grew whiskers. However to this point he looked completely lifeless, a golden statue of an anthropomorphic lion wearing a rather regal outfit. He couldn&#39;t even move his eyes, locked into looking forward to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the chanting stopped, and after a moment of silence he sat up rapidly. He could move again. The first thing he noticed that he wasn&#39;t breathing, this made him panic and he started to force himself to breath which felt incredibly unnatural. The fox bowed down to him, followed by the other statues in their places and guided him to the throne, his throne. He stood up and although he felt, perhaps even a bit lighter than before, he was certain that he was now made out of solid gold as he could feel his weight shifting even the plates below the carpet a bit. His clothes behaved as if they were regular, but closer inspection revealed that they, too, were made out of solid gold. Sitting down on the throne, his throne, he noticed that even though it was just made of polished slabs of stone, it felt rather comfortable. It was certainly fit to sit on it for hours, or years, or centuries?</p>
