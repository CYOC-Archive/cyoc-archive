<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>While I&#39;m very happy with how Earth-2 has panned out (which I suspect is nearing an end) there are a few things I would have liked to do differently. Back when I started the Earth-2 thread, I didn&#39;t expect so many people to jump onboard. So while I love reading what others have contributed (ideas I would have never come up with) I&#39;ve been itching to get mine out too. <br/>
<br/>
So if it&#39;s not too much of an inconvenience, and not too selfish of myself to ask, I&#39;d like to have this thread just for me. Some stuff will be the same, some new. Again, PLEASE DO NOT ADD CHAPTERS!!! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk back to Eric’s house was quiet and a little awkward. Neither knew what to say. The tension, sexual tension to be specific, between the teenagers was as thick as soup. Spencer noticed that Eric was avoiding any sort of direct eye contact. Every time their eyes did meet, he blushed. <br />
<br />
“He’s cute when he embarrassed.” she thought, watching Eric’s cheeks flush until they were a light pink color. <br />
<br />
Once a block away from the house, Spencer could see movement in the living room. So the two cut to the backyard, and proceeded to sneak in through Eric’s bedroom window. Thankfully no one noticed that Eric was still out. Because if they had, they would have sent a search party after him if they had. <br />
<br />
“Be careful.” Spencer said. Eric was perched on a branch (much like she had been earlier when she saw Julie and her mystery lover), trying to open his window. It wasn’t locked, but Eric’s arms were quite long enough to reach. <br />
<br />
“Damn it.” Eric felt the window frame slip under his fingers, and he had to pull back to steady himself <br />
<br />
“Need some help?” Spencer looks up at Eric’s frustrated face. <br />
<br />
“Ya. But if I can’t reach there’s no way you can.” <br />
<br />
“Just give me a minute.” Spencer said. Eric wasn’t sure what Spencer was planning to do, though it became fairly obvious after a minute. She took off her clothing, piled them into a nice square heap, and transformed. <br />
<br />
Eric knew he shouldn’t stare, but he did. Watching Spencer change was so… incredible. Not entirely a werewolf, not entirely a werepanther. And at least eight feet tall and growing. She easily scaled the tree with her feline paws. Eric was worried their combined weight would snap the tree branch, but Spencer climbed higher. Situated above the window, she bent down to pull the pane up. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Eric said. He was nowhere near as graceful as Spencer, so his entry into his room was bumpy to say the least. Eric took his sweet time swinging his body forward. And in the end, he still clipped his arm as he dove through the window. He bit back a curse and looked at Spencer. <br />
<br />
“You okay?” <br />
<br />
“Ya. Anyway, thanks for everything.” Eric said sheepishly. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what are friends for?” Spencer smiled at Eric before leaping from her perch. Being a werepanther, she naturally landed on her paws. Eric leaned out the window, watching as Spencer picked up her pile of clothing and then jog off into the forest behind his house. Her black and silver tipped tail wagging very contently. <br />
<br />
Eric laid back on his bed, wondering if she felt the same way he did. Though Julie had broken his heart, and he was willing to give her a second chance, there was something about Spencer that  just gave him goosebumps. In a good way. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
That night, everyone in Moon Lake slept well. Julie and Brian had since parted company, as Julie’s parents would blow a fuse if they discovered she wasn’t in her bed. And Brian’s mother was in the next room, so they didn’t want to risk her catching the two. Although Brian insisted that his mom would be too tired to wake up, let alone investigate the source of the bizarre sounds. <br />
<br />
In the woods behind the Anderson and Twist houses, two separate couples had passed out in each other’s arms. Nate and Kenya wrapped in a firm embrace, one still inside the other. The young werewolf was on cloud nine, though still had his reservations about dating the older werepanther. <br />
<br />
A mile or so away, Ben and Alex were sprawled out on the forest floor. The two were well past spent, and sleep was all they wanted. Both wolves had curled into balls to keep warm. It was, after all, nearing December. Even with all that fur they still got chilled occasionally. <br />
<br />
While everyone else was resting comfortably, Spencer was restless as ever. She’d slipped back into her own home, but sleep was the last thing on her mind. She hadn’t expected to develop a crush on anyone this soon. Yet here she was completely lovestruck by Eric Anderson. There was just something about him. She couldn’t say what, maybe it was that he was so different from the kind of guys she usually went for. <br />
<br />
“It’s a welcomed change compared to Jeremy.” Spencer mutters. She stalked upstairs, no bothering to change back. In her fursona she didn’t exactly fit on the bed. With her tail whipping back and force by the side of the bed, Spencer wondered what kind of were Eric would want to be, should he make the change. <br />
<br />
The man of the hour was lying in his own bed, having a particularly intense dream. <br />
<br />
…. Eric and Julie were at her house, kissing on her couch. And as Eric pulled away, he sensed something was wrong. Why were their bubbles floating around them? He panicked when he realized they were underwater. <br />
<br />
“Eric, it’s okay. You can breathe down here remember?” Julie chuckled. Eric blinked, uncomprehending for a moment. Then looked down and saw a fish tail were his legs should be. When he looked back up, Julie had an evil gleam in her eyes. She had a tight grip on his wrist, and pulled him in for another kiss. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what are you doing?” Eric tried to scream at Julie, but only bubbles came out of his mouth. He then tried to swim away from her, but his tail seemed to have a mind of its own. It wrapped itself around Julie’s gold tail, and forced Eric closer to Julie. <br />
<br />
“You said you’ve change for me. I couldn’t wait anymore. I’m sorry, but it’s better this way.” she whispered before latching her lips on his…. <br />
<br />
It was at that point Eric shot forward in his bed. He was still wearing his clothes from yesterday. And to his embarrassment, his bed was soaking wet. A combination of sweat and cum. He’d never had a wet dream so intense before. His pajama bottoms are covered in the sticky stuff. Checking his bedside clock, and seeing it was only 5:47 AM, Eric flew into the bathroom to clean up. At least no one else was around to see him in his soiled pants. <br />
<br />
Dumping them into the dirty hamper, Eric listened for any sounds coming from the basement. When he heard silence, Eric crept back into his bedroom so he rest. But he couldn’t fall back to sleep. Not with that damn dream haunting him. <br />
<br />
Eric continued to stare at his ceiling until at last morning came. He patiently waited until he heard the Twists and the Lawsons leave. Then gave his parents time to get themselves cleaned up before making his entrance. <br />
<br />
“Morning everyone.” Eric said has he walked downstairs. He slid onto a chair next to his father, and helped himself to some of the food before him. The kitchen island was covered in everything from eggs to fruit, to piles of bacon and pancakes. One thing Eric enjoyed about living with weres, you never went hungry. Plus his mother enjoyed cooking, so she always went a little overboard when she could. <br />
<br />
“Someone’s in a good mood. I take it you enjoyed your little excursion last night.” William said, raising a surprised brow. After the way Eric stormed off, he was expecting his far more sensitive son to be in worse shape. It would appear Eric woke up on the right side of the bed. <br />
<br />
“Yep.” Eric said, going back for another piece of bacon. Behind his back, William and Martha exchanged a bewildered look. There were two things they were almost certain of. One, Eric wasn’t a morning person. Two, he was hiding something.<br />
<br />
“Where did you go last night?” Martha asked, putting a full plate of food in front of Eric. <br />
<br />
“I walked around the neighborhood for a while.” Eric half lied. He had made the decision while lying in bed that he wouldn’t tell his parents what happened last night until things were officially over with Julie. <br />
<br />
He was so caught up daydreaming he’d forgotten the unfortunate business with Julie momentarily. He wasn’t sure if he should tell his parents just yet, since things could still work themselves out. Of course Eric had no way of knowing that last night Julie spent the bulk of the evening wrapped in bed with Brian Walker. <br />
<br />
“That’s it? When did you get back?” Martha presses. Eric slowly swallows the mouthful of food so he can think about his answer.<br />
<br />
“Um…. I don’t really know. Later than I should have. I didn’t want to bother you guys so I just crept in through the, uh, back door.” Eric lied. <br />
<br />
“It wasn’t locked?” William asked. <br />
<br />
“Uh, well no I guess not.” Eric said, trying to remain calm. He scarfs down the rest of his meal and vanishes upstairs, muttering something about needing to do homework.<br />
<br />
“I wonder what really happened last night.” Martha said as Eric half ran up the stairs and back to his room. <br />
<br />
“My best guess is that he went to Julie’s house.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe. On a side note, I know the kitchen smells like food now, but did you smell anything odd when Eric was here.”<br />
<br />
“Odd? Not exactly. I assumed the ‘odd’ smells were coming from us. Wearing the same clothes from last night, and all.” William said. The first chance he got, he was jumping into a shower to rid himself of all the extra scents. Since, while he enjoys them, it would be a bit inappropriate to walk around town with them. Even if weres are generally understanding about these kinds of things. It’s just better not to run around smelling like a frat house. <br />
<br />
“No, there was definitely something off about Eric’s scent. I can’t really place it though. It was familiar somehow…” Martha trailed off as she once again tried to place the smell. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry too much about it. Eric will tell us about last night when he’s ready. And on that note, would you care to join me in the shower?” William shifted in his seat so that he was facing Martha across the kitchen island. <br />
<br />
“Down boy, I’ve got some school work to do before we can have anymore fun. Work before play,” she says. William looks a bit dejected, but doesn’t argue. He has papers of his own to grade and others to go over. All work and no play… More like all play and no work. Since becoming a were, if William wasn’t thinking about his work or his sons, chances were he had sex on the brain. It was like being a teenager again. Except he had something far more enticing than a Playboy, and a stolen watermelon.</p>
