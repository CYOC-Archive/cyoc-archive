<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer sat outside the cafeteria, eating lunch with her friends at their usual spot. Lin was talking about how she didn&#39;t like her name because it was a &quot;Kelsey&quot;; a name that could be given to a boy or girl. &quot;Makes me think of how many times flat Kelsey been have been mistaken for a boy.&quot; Jen replied giggling. &quot;Flat Kelsey&quot; was a goth girl who, as the name suggested, did not have particularly well-endowed mammaries. Combined with her fairly boyish appearance, it had led the school rumor mill to conclude that the girl was trans, until a group of girls had surreptitiously checked in the locker room before P.E. Regardless, the name had stuck and cliques like Jen&#39;s often called stuck to the name even in her presence.<br />
<br />
Jen had just suggested that they go find Kelsey to get the answer from her, when she suddenly yelped. &quot;EEP!&quot; Jen made a high-pitched squeal as she quickly bore down to accept the penis pressing into her asshole. &quot;You alright girl?&quot; Tyra asked raising her eyebrow. &quot;Ahh, y-yeah...must have got the hickups from lunch haha.&quot; Jen said to the group with a shudder before regaining her composure. &quot;Actually, I just need to sit for a while. Forget flat Kelsey, how are you and Jake?&quot; As Tyra related what had happened on their last date, Jen kept the conversation going, hoping he would finish quickly as she sat rooted to the table by her gaping hole. <i>Really, now?! He must be here at school. Grr, he&#39;s probably close, but I can&#39;t move!</i> <br />
<br />
For the past week, she&#39;d reluctantly submitted to the daily anal sex instigated by the student who&#39;d found her asshole. Most mornings she&#39;d awaken to the pressing of his head against her sphincter, as she grudgingly let him in by relaxing her anus. After she&#39;d milked his cock dry and felt him spurt in her rectum, she&#39;d feel him put her plug back in (the first time resisting all the way until first period until it was inevitably pushed in by the weight above it) and she was free to go about her day, her ass stuffed with cum and silicone all the while. She never got a break; during class and after school the plug reminded her that her asshole now belonged to someone else. Someone with a grudge against her. The worst part was the knowledge that every day her body even cleaned up after him, her rectum slowly absorbing the cum from that morning, a perfect sex toy. And at night, she would feel the plug taken back out as her ass was quickly penetrated again by her mystery assailant. Some nights, he wouldn&#39;t take her out at all, and she felt every nocturnal erection of his as her back door opened again and again. Today however, she had finally felt a reprieve from the constant presence in her behind. She thought that perhaps she had &quot;earned&quot; this break from whoever now held her rosebud, but as she felt her rectum receive his thrusts while surrounded by her friends, she began thinking the real reason was much worse.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nick stood in the boys room nearby, overhearing the clique&#39;s gossip outside the stall. <i>God, you all can&#39;t go two minutes without bad-mouthing someone, can you? Unfortunately, only you have detachable parts Jen, so your ass is going to have to pay for all of it.</i> Nick felt bad for Kelsey, as a simple quirk of her anatomy made her the target of bullies like Jen, so he figured it was fair game to use Jen&#39;s anatomy against her to prevent them from seeking Kelsey out. <i>Can&#39;t exactly walk around while getting ass-fucked, huh?</i> As he felt Jen&#39;s anus furiously squeeze and milk him in an attempt to get him to cum, he let himself give in as his spunk coated her inner walls. He had let her off easy, in the knowledge that this evening would make up for it. As she heard Jen lead the group away, probably so she could surreptitiously stand outside the bathroom he was in, he quickly placed Jennifer&#39;s anus back on his cock before zipping his pants up and leaving quickly. <i>People have had to take your shit for a long time. Now, they&#39;ll take the rest of your ass too.</i><br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why are we all here again? And why&#39;d you bring drinks?&quot; Caleb said. Nick was someone he knew from school, but not particularly well. They were pleasant acquaintances at best, so when Nick had invited him over to his house it had come as a surprise to him. Still, his invitation had referenced something about revenge against someone who&#39;d wronged them, which was sufficiently vague and ominous enough to arouse his curiosity. And so, here he was. Looking around, he couldn&#39;t spot any similarities between the people there; with the exception of two nerds (of which Nick was one) they all seemed to be from different social groups; there was Rich, a somewhat smarmy boy from the preppy group. Fairly close to to the popular kids, if not for the fact that Rich had happened to confess to Jennifer Smith once and been relentlessly mocked for months because of it. And there was Terrance, who was sometimes picked on for his extremely-visible bald spot halfway up the left side of his scalp, which he often covered with a hat. He was a normal kid who was equally likely to be found reading a book, playing a video game, or playing basketball after school. Kyle was in a league all his own. Caleb didn&#39;t even know if he <i>had</i> friends, but he considered him the second nerd. Caleb himself was a skater, who had botched a landing bad and broken both legs due to that same Jennifer yelling that his fly was down on his approach (it hadn&#39;t been). And finally flat Kelsey was a goth, and the only girl there. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure assembled a motley crew. I&#39;m wondering what this is all about too.&quot; Kyle said crossing his arms. Caleb couldn&#39;t help but notice the corners of his lips barely turned upwards, as if he was hiding a smile. &quot;While you have a nice house, this isn&#39;t the breakfast club. Spit it out Nick.&quot; Terrance said bluntly. Nick had been watching them enter gradually, but had told them to wait until everyone arrived. There was no hiding his grin. &quot;You&#39;re right, there&#39;s nothing that unites the five of us. Except...do any of you know Jennifer Smith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that bitch got to do with this? Fucking cunt ruined my reputation, can&#39;t believe I ever liked her.&quot; Rich blurted out with more than a little resentment. &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s the reason I have that stupid nickname.&quot; Kelsey chimed in. The rest of them said nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has everything to do with this. In fact, she&#39;s the reason I brought you all here. She&#39;s the reason for our little revenge group.&quot; Nick&#39;s slow drawl would sound like something out of a movie, if not for the fact that his voice cracked at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a little vague, you got some pics from her phone or something?&quot; Terrance said skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got <i>better.</i> Tell me, do you all know of that cosmetic procedure she got a couple of months ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sounds like some freaky shit, being able to separate from your junk like that. I&#39;ve never heard of anything like it.&quot; Rich said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, how? Even with her money, how is that possible?&quot; Terrance was incredulous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything is possible.&quot; Kyle said cryptically before pausing a moment. &quot;But get to the point Nick, otherwise you&#39;re just wasting our time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright already. So now you all know Jen&#39;s got a detachable pussy. But what you don&#39;t know is that that&#39;s not all she got done. She happened to leave <i>this</i> behind on her chair the day she told everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit....is that her...?!?&quot; Caleb&#39;s eyes bugged out as everyone in the room stared at the clenching pucker in Nick&#39;s hand. Even Kyle, who had kept icy calm the entire time, was mildly surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed it is. She left it behind that day, I happened to find it, and I&#39;ve hidden it ever since. Out of all the people in the school, you five were probably done worst by Jen. Given the magnitude of my find, I decided to offer it to you to...work out your frustrations. I trust that none of you are so altruistic towards her as to help poor Jen find her lost little rose?&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment, there was silence as the gears turned in each of their heads. &quot;Fuck no! That bitch can go to hell.&quot; Kelsey exclaimed abruptly. &quot;Yeah, I might not be her boyfriend, but I can still give her a ride.&quot; Rich said with a smirk. &quot;I like your thought process.&quot; Terrance matched it. &quot;Not exactly what I expected, but I like this little group&quot; Kyle added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Count me in, in every sense of the word. But you still didn&#39;t explain the drink. Not quite enough for a party, and there&#39;s no mixers.&quot; Caleb replied, pointing out the single half-empty bottle of vodka on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was in case you still didn&#39;t believe me.&quot; Nick explained, picking up the bottle and uncapping it. &quot;But I suppose I can do the demonstration anyway. Watch.&quot; Procuring a funnel from a nearby table, Nick squeezed it into Jen&#39;s hole surprisingly quickly. &quot;Think she&#39;s gotten drunk that way before?&quot; Rich asked. &quot;No. During the two months since I found it, I&#39;ve been training her ass in preparation for this day. She&#39;s learned that trying to prevent me from getting in there doesn&#39;t help in the long run, so now she relaxes herself and opens up whenever I press something here. Still don&#39;t think she likes it though.&quot; Nick replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Wouldn&#39;t be much of a revenge if we&#39;re just passing around some slut&#39;s asshole,&quot; Kelsey said. &quot;Speaking of, I&#39;m a girl, in case any of you were still wondering. How exactly am I going to &#39;work out my frustrations&#39; on Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look in the cabinet over there. I think you&#39;ll find all you need.&quot; Nick said over his shoulder as he lined up the bottle. &quot;There. I&#39;ve been looking up how alcohol is absorbed in different ways. That should be enough for Jen to have a mean hangover tomorrow, which should verify that this is indeed the real asshole of that real asshole. Now who wants to go first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take a spin.&quot; Everyone turned around to see Kelsey with her pants off, clutching a humongous strap-on between her legs.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The room was spinning as Jen left her homework at the desk and stumbled over to her bed. She had felt the burning liquid being poured down(up?) her colon and just realized what it was as her cheeks flushed. Lying down, she shuddered at the level of control her mystery thief had just displayed over her body. &quot;Wha&#39;dya do that fer...I can&#39;t do homewerk wasted ya prick...&quot; Jen muttered as the vodka coursed through her veins. &quot;Ohgodwhat-&quot; Jen quickly plunged her head into the pillow and squealed as she felt the thick silicone cock split her open. She had never felt so full, her distant anus fully stretched by the sex toy. As it began to work between Jen&#39;s cheeks, all she could do was wail into her pillow as her pussy started to overflow on her nightstand.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Kyle watched as each of them had a turn with Jennifer&#39;s hole until he was the last one left. All of them with the exception of Kelsey and Nick had taken it to Nick&#39;s bathroom to do the deed, perhaps unsurprisingly given that they were still awkward, and for the most part &quot;un-cool&quot; teens. If anything, he applauded Kelsey&#39;s and Nick&#39;s aplomb. <i>Nick must be under a lot of pressure right now, wondering if he&#39;s chosen the right people. It was a good idea to keep the circle small.</i> Kyle mused. He had been expecting Jen to lose something, and was disappointed when she seemed to be living normally after he had cursed her, but when Nick had invited him over he instantly knew what was going to happen.<br />
<br />
Or at least, mostly knew. Kyle had to admit he fully expected Nick to pull Jen&#39;s pussy out during the explanation, and was surprised it had been her other hole he&#39;d snagged. He hadn&#39;t mentioned her asshole during his curse, so it&#39;s appearance confused him. Perhaps the curse had generalized his transformation to &quot;Jennifer&#39;s sexual organs&quot; being detachable. Still, he wasn&#39;t complaining; she might still have her pussy but her ass was lost to her now, and it turned him on to think of all the changes that were going on &#39;under the hood&#39; even as he failed to see anything visible during his clandestine observation of Jen post-cursing. As he smirked at the thought, he heard the faucet shut off and Caleb walk out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the last member of the group Kyle, have at her.&quot; he said, literally tossing Jen to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but if it&#39;s alright with you I&#39;m going to hold off for a while.&quot; Kyle replied, examining Jen&#39;s washed-pristine anus with mild interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You&#39;re not suddenly gaining some <i>sympathy</i> for the bitch, are you...?&quot; Nick said, his face darkening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not. There&#39;s a reason, I assure you. But first, we need to ensure loyalty. There can be no turncoats in this room, <i>nor</i> among any future members we invite into our little secret society.&quot; Kyle caught Nick&#39;s eyes significantly at that last part. &quot;I say we all go again, but we come out halfway through and have our picture taken. That way we&#39;re all targets if someone tells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s <i>your</i> loyalty we&#39;re questioning mister mastermind.&quot; Kelsey said dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand. And that is <i>precisely</i> the other reason I need to hold back for a moment. I don&#39;t think any of you will suspect me of any secret sympathy towards Jen after what I&#39;m about to tell you. In fact, I think it may convince you, Nick, that I should be the right-hand man in the group. I&#39;d be happy to, if you&#39;d like.&quot; Kyle&#39;s eyes scanned the room, making sure everyone was paying attention.<br />
<br />
Rich, who had been in the kitchen drinking some of the remaining vodka, raised an eyebrow and looked his way. &quot;And that is...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle held up the part of Jen they had all been playing with that evening. &quot;How does this work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their faces clouded in confusion for a second before clearing again, just as Kyle expected. &quot;Fuck, beats me. Like Nick said, some sorta cosmetic procedure.&quot; Terrance finally piped up, shrugging his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;A cosmetic procedure? How does that create what is essentially a wormhole between us here and Jen&#39;s bowels?&quot; Kyle prodded, raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;...You&#39;re right, that doesn&#39;t really make sense. But what else could it be?&quot; Nick asked inquisitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s magic. Specifically, dark magic. Heard of the transform or dare curse?&quot; Kyle let the words sink in.<br />
<br />
Rich almost snorted up some of the vodka. &quot;Fuckin&#39; <i>magic?!?</i> What, some leprechauns popped her shitter out while she was sleeping? I know we&#39;re gonna be seeing more of each other from now on, but let&#39;s save the family-bonding campfire stories for some other time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rich, you just fucked your former crush&#39;s asshole while she was miles away. Tell me how that isn&#39;t magic. That&#39;s the curse redirecting your mind to plausible explanations.&quot; Kyle stuck his finger into Jen&#39;s pucker, turning it sideways to emphasize how it was teleporting it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you know so much about this legendary curse?&quot; Nick pressed him.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s face grew a wolfish grin. &quot;Because <i>I&#39;m</i> the one that cursed her. You have me and the curse to thank for her being detachable, not some plastic surgeon. <i>That&#39;s</i> why you shouldn&#39;t doubt me; The curse I put on her is the reason her asshole&#39;s theivable in the first place, she didn&#39;t do it willingly. The surgery explanation was just her cover story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Kelsey and Caleb gasped as comprehension dawned on all their faces, their belief in the curse obviating the need for it to influence their acceptance. &quot;Holy shit...all this time, it was so obvious...&quot; Nick said incredulously, looking down at his hands.<br />
<br />
Terrance stared out the window with a thoughtful look on his face. &quot;According to the stories, you can change someone&#39;s form or behavior however you want with this curse.&quot; He turned to look at Kyle.  I&#39;m gonna assume that&#39;s true, and you picked <i>this</i> as the curse for Jen. I&#39;ve gotta say, I&#39;m not sure whether to be terrified at your level of perversion, disgusted at myself for partaking in it, or thankful that you gave that bitch her comeuppance. I&#39;m feelin&#39; all three. But mainly that last one, with a hint of &#39;fuck yeah&#39;.&quot; He unexpectedly raised his hand, Kyle returning his fist bump.<br />
<br />
&quot;So she&#39;s got a magic ass, huh...?&quot; Kelsey said, drawing a chuckle out of all of them. &quot;Some girls have all the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think you&#39;d want to have the kind of &#39;fun&#39; Jen is having. I mean, unless you do. The curse is typically 50-50 on whether the target grows to like the changes or not, from what I could find researching it.&quot; Kyle got up as he continued explaining, &quot;But the reason I tell you this is that we have a lot more to worry about if we get caught than being busted or getting roughed up by Brad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to be careful that our part in this is never revealed to Jen, and that&#39;s why we require absolute loyalty, <i>no snitches.</i> Because now <i>Jen</i> has the curse.&quot; he said over his shoulder as he walked into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jennifer stumbled into her kitchen as she felt the water washing her insides. <i>Dammit, I&#39;m not some pass-around fucktoy!</i> She had certainly noticed the party coming in through her back door. <i>At least they gave me something to drink too...</i> some part of her mind was saying, unaware of the stone-cold sober atmosphere that had permeated Nick&#39;s house. Normal Jen would have hated the very thought, but drunk Jen found something darkly humorous to it. <i>At least I&#39;m getting hydration from both ends.</i> Jen pondered, thinking about the water that was washing her between rounds. <i>Eww....actually forget that.</i> Jen re-pondered thinking about what <i>else</i> she was absorbing through her colon. As she felt lube smeared around her anus again, she slumped to the kitchen floor in defeat. &quot;Fuckin&#39; hell....I thought ya all were done a-ready...&quot; Jen slurred as she drank down a cup of water she had brought down with her. She let out a sigh as she relaxed her bowels. &quot;Here, just get it over with...&quot; Jennifer hiccuped. &quot;...Because ah don&#39;t care if it takes to tha end of the school year!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>I&#39;m gonna find you...</i>&quot; were Jen&#39;s last words before she passed out on the ground.</p>
