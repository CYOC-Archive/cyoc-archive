<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly Holly opened her eyes and peered at her room, discomfort in her abdomen and groin chasing the weird dream about goats away. Groaning, trying to recall what she had been dreaming, thinking it had been something about an animal, she pushed the covers off her and sat up. The discomfort growing a bit, she peered down and blinking, she wondered if this was what she was supposed to feel as she recalled the talk her mom had had with her about year ago about how her body was changing.<br />
<br />
Unhappy that now she had to deal with a uncomfortable pressure of what felt liking something pressing downward inside her body in addition to her sore, itchy, and tender chest, Holly grumbled, &quot;This sucks,&quot; as she slide out of bed, thinking a hot shower might help alleviate some of the discomfort.<br />
<br />
A series of yawns escaped her and as she stumbled across her room, the twelve year old girl listened to hear if anyone else was up. The house silent, though she could smell the hints of coffee, which she thought meant at least one her parents was already up, Holly groaned as she exited out of her bedroom and trotted down the hall toward the bathroom. Not hearing anything from Taylor&#39;s room, the girl decided her younger sibling must still be asleep and stepping into the room, she flicked on the light and shut the door. Shucking off her night clothes, she tossed them into a nearby hamper, stopping only to check her panties, sure what she was feeling meant she was getting what her mother called a period.<br />
<br />
The cotton undies looking how they normally looked, Holly one armed hugged herself after she had dropped the garment in with the rest of her pyjamas. Turning her attention to the shower, she began running the water. Waiting until it got to a comfortable temperature, she climbed in, but didn&#39;t start washing herself.<br />
<br />
Instead, she stood under the pulsing water, letting it run over her face and body, liking the massaging feeling, but upset it did nothing to lessen the pain in her abdomen and groin. Leaning against the shower wall, starting to breath heavily, she shifted in place. Spreading her legs a little, she panted, &quot;Oh, God,&quot; as the downward pressure seemed to grow and squatting down, she pressed her hands firmly on her knees and peered downward, thinking, &quot;Shit. Is this what all girls feel like when they first get their period?&quot; she began to gasp and pant heavily.<br />
<br />
Unable to see what was happening, Holly would have been alarmed if she had been able to. Her vagina sealing as the lips of her vulva bulged outward, whilst her urethra and clit fused together and began to lengthen. The downward pressure growing, increasing the pain she was in, the twelve year old thought for sure she would pass out and shifting in place, she reached up with one hand, grasped the ceramic soap holder built into the wall of the shower, leaned her head back until the shower water was beating gently on her face, scrunched her eyes shut and, unaware she was doing so, bared down. Grunting in exertion, discomfort and pain, she gasped out, &quot;Oh,&quot; then, &quot;Ah,&quot; and with a sudden blossoming of sheer relief, she sighed, but didn&#39;t open her eyes and instead remained squatting in the tub a moment longer.<br />
<br />
Minutes crept by and when she was certain that whatever had been the issue had passed, Holly slowly opened her eyes. Nervously worrying her lip, she slowly pulled herself up into a standing position, but stopped when she felt something brush against her leg. Looking down, she opened her mouth to scream, but at the last minute clapped a hand over her mouth, making a weird sort of muffled squeaking sound instead.<br />
<br />
Horrified by what she saw, she whimpered, &quot;No, no, no,&quot; then, &quot;Oh shit, shit, shit,&quot; before squeezing her eyes shut. Unwilling to accept what she had seen, she took a couple deep, shuddering breaths and told herself, &quot;You&#39;re mistaken. There&#39;s no way you could have, one of those,&quot; and trying to will the sight of what she&#39;d seen from her mind, she took another series of deep breaths before slowly opening her eyes and staring down, past her now flat chest to what was clearly a series of boy parts.<br />
<br />
A whimper, &quot;Oh, crap. Is this what happens to all who mess with the amulet&#39;s power,&quot; and Holly gingerly reached down and touched herself. Feeling how the cock felt, she ran a hand over her sack and feeling the balls inside, she withdrew her hand, knowing they were real and that she now had a boy&#39;s twig and berries. And then, to her horror, her bladder released and a stream of urine shot out.<br />
<br />
Watching as she peed, indecisive on how she should feel that she was peeing standing up, Holly&#39;s mind flashed to the Amulet of Zulo and thinking, &quot;It can change me back,&quot; she didn&#39;t bother with the rest of her shower as she shut off the water, grabbed two towels, one she wrapped around her torso, the other over her head, and hurrying out if the bathroom, forgetting to turn off the light, she hurried down the hall and toward her room.<br />
<br />
Inside, she shut and locked the door. Breathing heavily, hating the way her boy parts brushed against her legs, how she walked with her legs more apart, Holly marched across her room. Flinging open her closet, she pulled the loose panelling out and stared in muted horror at the pipes. Not seeing either her notebook or the amulet, she began to whisper, &quot;No,&quot; over and over, adding in, &quot;I cannot be like this. I cannot become a boy. I don&#39;t want to be a boy,&quot; repeatedly as she tried to figure out what had happened to not only her notebook, but also the necklace, certain both should be still where she had hidden them.<br />
<br />
Seconds slipped past and still she didn&#39;t move from where she was. A sniff escaped her and Holly wondered what she had done to deserve growing boy parts and loosing her breast buds. Dropping the towel on the floor, the girl stood and headed for her bed. Flopping down on it, feeling her twig and berries pressing into the soft cotton bottom sheet, she turned over on her side, groaned when she felt them brushing against her leg, then rolled over on her back. Staring up at the ceiling, she whispered, &quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot; and thinking she was being punished, she began to question what she&#39;d done to Dion and what she&#39;d plan to do to him next. Crossing her arms over her chest, her mind drifting, she asked herself, &quot;Am I being punished?&quot; as she considered how she&#39;d planned to leave Dion as a girl for about another week before turning him into either a dog or a cat, the collar for either animal already purchased and hidden in her vanity, and whether she could find the amulet again and stop what was happening to her.<br />
<br />
Having no answer to any of her questions, Holly huffed in agitation and rolled off her bed. Heading toward her dresser, she took out a short sleeve shirt, a training bra, jeans, socks and underwear. Slipping on the undies, she groaned at not only how wrong it felt wearing them, but also the bulge her boy parts made. Pushing them down, trying to tuck them back, she huffed in frustration when that didn&#39;t work and after a minute, she tore them off and tossed them across her room. Angry that she couldn&#39;t wear girl&#39;s panties, that her mind actually rebelled at such a thing, she yanked on the jeans, hating how the boy parts brushed against the inside of them. Pulling on the shirt, she stopped and peered at the bra a moment before thinking, &quot;I cannot wear that. It&#39;s inappropriate. It&#39;s for...&quot; then stopped herself in mid-thought as she realised what she&#39;d just told herself and how she felt about wearing such a garment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to find the Amulet of Zulo,&quot; she muttered in anger after a bit and pulling on her socks, she wondered where the necklace was. Considering looking where she had originally found it, Holly decided against it as it didn&#39;t seem likely she would find it there a second time.<br />
<br />
Back outside her room, she could hear the shower running and smell the breakfast mom was cooking. Thinking it was her brother-turned-sister in the shower, and that she really didn&#39;t care who was in the shower, she started for the stairs down, but stopped after a couple steps. Glancing at the bathroom door, thinking about Taylor and what she had done, what she planned, then about the necklace, she whispered, &quot;No. It&#39;s not possible,&quot; and continuing to stare at the bathroom door, she wondered if maybe the boy-turned-girl had somehow found it.</p>
