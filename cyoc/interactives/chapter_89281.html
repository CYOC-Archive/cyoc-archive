<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Turning to Leon Scott couldn&#39;t help but wonder why he was in the apartments in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what&#39;s you story&quot; Scott bluntly asks.<br />
<br />
 The blond boy turns away from Scott, his head bowed down. &quot;To be honest these past few days have been crazy for me&quot; Leon couldn&#39;t help but say in a somewhat relieved voice, still facing away from Scott he moved to look out a window. &quot;One moment I was with my mom down at the market, the next she is being raped by a massive German Shepard. I tired to call for help but everyone around us was in a panic, all over the place people were being attacked by these dogs, that came out of nowhere.&quot; Scott couldn&#39;t help but have some sympathy for the boy, he moved closer to Leon placing a hand on his shoulder, an encouraging smile on his face. &quot;I moved to help her when I noticed what was happening&quot; Leon&#39;s voice barely chocking out the words. &quot; She was enjoying it, her face was morphed into one of pure bless, I had no clue what I was supposed to do. She was being defiled by a mutt (Leon&#39;s fist tightened), so I did what I had too.&quot; Leon&#39;s disposition suddenly took a dark turn, his face covered by shadows, Scott couldn&#39;t help but take a step back. &quot;I grabbed a discarded shopping cart and rammed the beast, crushing its skull underneath the metal contraption several times, until I was sure it was dead. I turned to help my mother but it was then that I noticed it.&quot; Leon chocked up, tears streaming down his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its ok Leon, your safe now, just let it out.&quot; Scott couldn&#39;t help himself, seeing the younger male in such distress he moved to were he could comfort Leon. Rapping his arms around Leon&#39;s chest Scott thought back to the initial chaos that followed the virus, it was as if the entire world went to hell and he missed the Memo. &quot;Go on Leon you will fell much better letting it all out.&quot; Scott then distanced himself from Leon, allowing the boy to continue his tale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so I turned to help her when I saw that she was still face down, I thought she was in pain after coming to about what had just happened. I could have never been more wrong, once I moved to help her she sat up clumsily, I thought she was hurt. It was when I reached out to her that I saw her face...it was nothing like my mother, her face was pulled out in a half muzzle, her nose darkening by the second&quot; Leon was shaking, his hands were practically suffering from muscle spasms. &quot;She looked up at me and I saw only vague recognition in those murky brown depths, she couldn&#39;t even see that her son was in front of her.&quot; Leon turned away from Scott, his hands no longer moving. &quot;I watched her turn into a dog, the very same breed of the kind that raped her. First she fell on her back, throwing her limbs up like a dog on all fours, her hair began to fall out off her head and yet it was being replaced by a dark fur covering her body. She began yipping in pleasure as her breast shrunk in size and then multiplied down her chest, she began to wiggle out of her clothes. She then moved into a squatting position and I watched as her hands and feet were gradually changed into paws, nails that she once spent hours designing now turning a blackish shade and curving into claws. Her muzzle was fully complete looing out of place on her face, but at the rate her head was shifting it soon looked like that of any regular female German Shepard. Her ears moved to the top of her head ending in a triangular point and a tail began squirming its way out of her rump. In the final moments she laid on her back once more and allowed her chest to barrel out, losing any semblance to that of a human shape.&quot; Leon turned to look at Scott, a haunted look adoring his face. &quot;In minutes it was over and my mom was no a mangy mutt, I had no clue what I was supposed to do, so I ran.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leon moved towards Scott and grabbed him by the shoulders, the young teenage stood there using Scott as support. &quot;I ran away from my mom.&quot; Looking up Scott saw that Leon&#39;s eye were once again watery. &quot;I didn&#39;t even try to see of there was anything I could do I just ran, and after that I hide out in a dumpster outside this building for two whole days, too terrified to even move.&quot; In one swift movement Leon had dragged Scott away to the window and showed him through the class, one isolated trash dumpster a good thirty yards from the front entrance by the corner of another building. &quot;I only tried to leave today, and well you saw how that worked out.&quot; Leon said his voice empty of almost all emotions, he turned to Scott though and said &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for you I would have ended up like my mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott stood and led Leon over to the bedroom in the apartment, facing the young teenager he told him to get some rest and that things would soon be better, he had no way of knowing that things were only getting worse.</p>
