<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dale had once been a normal 18-year-old young man when the demons of hell took over Earth, now he sat to the left of Lucifer the King of Hell himself as his new daughter. She still remembered her or his old life, his time in school, his friends, his failed relationships with his two past girlfriends and most of all how his own mother and father had used him as a decoy so that they could get away with his/her younger brother. She knew all this, but yet she also knew how she looked without even seeing a mirror yet, she knew how to walk in her 8in high heels and how to fly with her new bat like wings. She knew all this yet she had only been a demon and a woman for less then five minutes. She even crossed her legs like she had been doing her entire life. She turned her head and started to study the thrown room around her.<br />
<br />
The large stain glass windows which showed different images of hell which would have scared any human but caused a smile to cross her face. She even knew she now had short fangs hidden under her perfect lips. She wondered where she was for a moment and then as if she remembered but yet she hadn’t seen it herself she knew she was in the throne room, in the main castle which sat in the heart of the new capital city of this world. <br />
<br />
“How do I know that…” whispered Dale her voice so sexy and feminine that it should have sounded strange to her but it sounded so normal to her.<br />
<br />
“You know it because your memories are coming in dear daughter.” Said Lucifer as he turned his head and gave her a smile. “All transformed humans gain some memories needed to perform their duties in this new world, be it knowledge of how to work in a factory or how to give pleasure and in cases like you it is what you look like and sound like.”<br />
<br />
“I still remember my old life…will that go away father?” inquired Dale, she called Lucifer father without a second delay as if she had been saying it her whole life.<br />
<br />
“No, it doesn’t.” answered Lucifer “I still remember my time among the Angels of heaven, every human and demon remember what they once were.”<br />
<br />
“What does that mean?” inquired Dale as the sound of the doors at the far end beginning to open. Your father didn’t answer instead he stood up and so did you, as the sound of footsteps filled the hall. The sound of high heels bounced off the solid black marble floor. <br />
<br />
Dale saw her at a distance and as she came into the light her mind knew that it was Lilith, Wife of Lucifer and Queen of Hell and all the Demons. Her mother was home. <br />
<br />
She walked into the light and saw a breathtaking beautiful demon. She was tall, beautiful woman with a perfect face and impossibly green eyes which glowed unnaturally. Her long red hair was a darker shade then her new hair but was just as long and was perfectly blown out. Two perfectly smooth long green horns grew out of her head and went straight back before arching up a bit. Her skin was perfect, a golden collar was around her neck however this wasn’t a sign of enslavement but elegance. <br />
<br />
The collar held up the front of her open back dress. It was a dark green and was skintight on the top before opening up past her perfectly shaped hip. Her breasts had to be a large C cup which was perfect for her body type but not over the top. Her bust was visible through fishnet stocking which ran in a diamond shape from the collar arching over the breasts and coming to a point at her belly button. A long slit in the dress went up almost to her waist as she showed off her perfectly shaped legs which was semi covered with black fishnet stockings. It was sexily yet somewhat modest, the King of Hell wouldn’t want people looking at his Queen’s bare breasts, that was a right reserved for him. So she was dressed sexually yet somewhat modestly for a demon, same went for his daughter. The Queen’s green wings where not bat like instead it looked like pterodactyl with lime green flesh between the wings. Behind her a tail with a sharp hook just like her own one moved back and forth.<br />
<br />
“Dear husband I…” started Lilith as she spoke to Lucifer only to turn her eyes on Dale her eyes widened as she looked at her. Dale as he bowed her head Lilith raised her hand and called her forward. She didn’t know why but the formal human spread her wings and flew down the steps coming to a stop before the Queen of Hell. <br />
<br />
“Mother.” Said Dale not sure what would happen. <br />
<br />
What happened was Lilith pulling her into a hug and holding her close to her chest. <br />
<br />
“A daughter…I have a Daughter.” said Lilith through some tears as she hugs her tight before pulling back and looking at Dale with more care. Lilith was smiling as she turned Dale’s head and turned her around to look at her. Then she turned to Lucifer.<br />
<br />
“My Love, you put too much of me into her and not much of yourself.” Said Lilith as she turned and looked back a Dale. “Dear daughter what is your name?”<br />
<br />
“Dale…was my human name.” answered Dale<br />
<br />
“No…that will not do, a future Queen can’t be named Dale.” said Lilith “That will have to change.”<br />
<br />
“Yes…I don’t really know what to call myself yet.” Answered Dale “Truth be told I don’t really know what is happening.”<br />
<br />
“She was just transformed a few minutes ago.” Explained Lucifer <br />
<br />
“Well we have some explaining to do.” Said Lilith</p>
