<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally Jerry finished within Samantha.  It hadn&#39;t really taken long but it seemed to be forever!  Samantha just wasn&#39;t trying you found yourself thinking internally.  What was the big deal?  She was already a horse, already female...just let the male mount and move beneath him in ways that accommodated him.<br />
Oh...you thought.  Oh, I&#39;m already a horse, I&#39;m already female too.  You&#39;d forgotten.  The scene, the scents and being led by Vicky had all somehow numbed your horror at the situation you were in.  Your eyes moved with disgust to the jizzy puddle on the ground below Samantha&#39;s rear.  Up her hind legs you saw the ooze, rivulets of &#39;Jerry spunk&#39; trickling down, the thicker aspects of his semen more viscous and clinging in shining white glops to the outer lips of her vagina.<br />
Oh...I&#39;ve got the same parts as her...<br />
You looked at Vicky.  You were like her now too.  That was a curious thought, immediately, unconsciously, you dismissed the idea that you were really like her at all.  Vicky was...well, she was human!  Her body was a joy (you still remembered what it would feel like as a male human to have sex) yours, now, was basically a receptacle.  These stallions didn&#39;t give a shit what you looked like, what you were...they just wanted to get off and you were going to be convenient.<br />
Sure...your body &#39;did things&#39; to a male horse now; it&#39;s scents, tastes and other little hidden triggers your body would now send off in it&#39;s season of heat...but &#39;you&#39; didn&#39;t really matter!  You let a little snigger, a bitter self deprecating laugh go out from you.<br />
<br />
Vicky picked up on it.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right Princess, she&#39;s just one hole like any other.&quot; Then she laughed and made a snarky comment about thinking of Jerry as a &#39;boyfriend&#39;.<br />
&quot;Of course you probably have thought about that some, huh?  I mean having a boyfriend...what that would be like if you were human.  I bet you have all sorts of odd thoughts and dreams now with all this musk and testosterone floating into your nostrils.&quot;  She looked at you with a sly smile, &quot;Kinda makes you gay in a way, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;  Then she added, &quot;Too bad.  I kinda thought you were cute when you came in,&quot; laughing, &quot;You might make it out, who knows?  But you&#39;d be ruined as far as any self respecting woman goes.  I mean, would you want Jessica back after her little romp in the dust?&quot; Vicky laughed &quot;And after the fulfillment that new &#39;boyfriend&#39; provided even she wouldn&#39;t go back to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tried to nip at her but she sidestepped as if she&#39;d anticipated it.  However she didn&#39;t let it go unchecked.<br />
&quot;I know you don&#39;t really want to hurt me, but&quot; she was walking you toward the stable, &quot;it&#39;s also an obvious sign you need more training...just for your own good.&quot;<br />
She slipped inside and emerged with two items.  One, a grazing muzzle and another, a collar of some sort.<br />
&quot;This is a cribbing collar.&quot; She began attaching it under your neck and up over the top of your head.  &quot;It might interfere with your...uh, pleasure...during mating because you won&#39;t be able to raise your head and whinny...&quot; She winked, &quot;when Jerry finishes inside of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick image of yourself, like all the other mares as they fully relinquished masculinity and humanity, screaming out a triumphal orgasmic whinny flashed in your mind.  Their heads were thrown back, even Michelle&#39;s, when they felt that imminent moment of surrender...yours would stay downcast.<br />
Completely subordinate.<br />
You hated the thought!  Little man Jerry strutting his still male aspect even as a horse...you despised him; even as you desired him.<br />
Vicky&#39;s words snapped you back<br />
<br />
&quot;Jerry was human.  So was Jessica&#39;s mate.  Her stallion and Jerry and all the mares have all been human.  I always think about that and figure they all do too, especially the mares.  Kinda like &#39;Sure, I&#39;m a horse and whatever masculinity left in me is totally gay,&quot; she giggled, &quot;but at least this horse dude on my back was human before too.&#39; and Jerry and the other stallions can kinda tell themselves their not complete horse fuckers now because, after all these mares were human; plus they&#39;re female.  It must give them all some relief knowing at least that.&quot;<br />
Vicky led you into the barn, then out through a door she opened on the other side.  You&#39;d never been here.  You smelled stallion...but different, almost more stallion.  Like the stallions you&#39;d smelled for the past weeks...but stronger; more powerful...or something.<br />
&quot;Now this side...these are the real thing...&quot; she laughed, &quot;Story is that when they started all this they&#39;d use these stallions.  They supposedly stopped because it was too dangerous.  They supposedly killed too many of the male-to-filly mares.&quot;<br />
She looked at you.<br />
&quot;Of course, I don&#39;t believe it.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true...do you Princess?  I bet you could handle any of these boys.&quot;  She finished with an upbeat note in her voice.  &quot;Why you&#39;ve shown real fight, moxie...isn&#39;t that what they used to call it?&#39; she winked knowingly at you.<br />
<br />
You saw the interest in the eyes of the stallions that were clustering around you on the other side of the fenced area.  Their musky scent was extraordinary!  It aroused you like nothing else before...and terrified you too.<br />
These beasts had no limits.  Looking at them you realized that Jerry and the other human stallions still had some sort of human limits in them.<br />
These animals had only lust.<br />
And it was focused on you.<br />
<br />
Vicky tied your lead to the fence and walked off a little ways.<br />
&quot;Go ahead Princess...show them how you&#39;re a rebel.  Let them see your little acts of resistance like you show off to us and the little human stallions on the other side.  Go on...&quot;<br />
You felt yourself spraying hot urine.  Vicky laughed and clapped her hands.  You looked over at her desperately.  Terrified, you whinnied for her to come get you...at the same time you shifted your rear toward the stallions.<br />
A sharp, loud metal clang made Vicky jump and you try to pull free.<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;  Vicky reacted &quot;He really wants to plough your field...&quot;<br />
But it wasn&#39;t over yet because a different stallion came over and started nipping at the one who&#39;d kicked the fence and both reared up.  They were fighting over rights to you.  Not only were you to become an animal and owned by some person or corporation but a stallion would take the rights to your very body.<br />
A thrill ran through you, more urine squirted and you wanted to raise your head to call out...you also wanted to vomit and never exist.  Vicky was laughing, calling out lewd encouragements to both you and the stallions.  A third stallions snout knickered around your vagina and you felt his tongue flick out for a taste of your eagerness.  You backed into him without a thought of hesitancy.  Vicky laughed and called you a slut.  Terrified, you took her advice and splayed your hind legs further apart offering better access to his large tongue.  Your mind tried to reach out to Vicky&#39;s with a plea to be coupled with Jerry.  Not an obstinate, grudging acceptance of fate...you were begging Vicky to take you back over...you would scramble beneath Jerry eagerly!!<br />
<br />
But it was not to be.<br />
Vicky talked to one of the stablehands, a good looking guy about her age, and he moved the stallions away to the other side; all the while looking over at Vicky.  They both smiled flirtatiously at each other as she led you into the enclosure.<br />
Cribbing collar and muzzle still on, you were set free in the enclosure.  Vicky walked over to where the young man had the stallions...they kissed, then both walked to the fence on that side and hopped up, side by side, to watch...and kiss some more.<br />
<br />
You ran and ran, but the stallions were more than a match for any mare; much less for a weaker formerly human mare.  You knew they had an instinctual drive to take you simply for being in season.  When they locked in combat over you with each other you would stop running a moment to squirt some urine and rouse them to fight harder.<br />
You were a man, you thought...but...somehow, you wanted to be claimed.  At the same time you disgusted yourself with that thought.  And you were terrified; these were real stallions!  You sensed that they knew you to have been human.  Some primal dominance urge was even more triggered in them by that.  Maybe your scent, maybe anything but these stallions knew they would not only be claiming a mare...they would make a human into their conquest; and this spurred them on to a fury you had never seen.<br />
Slowly you stood longer, ran less.  The boy next to Vicky held up a hand.  Vicky called out &quot;Five minutes Princess! and they both laughed.  His hand was to indicate the five minutes, one for each finger.<br />
You would be free in five minutes<br />
...you could be free; you looked over at Vicky and her beau.  You wanted Vicky now.  If you were to become human again you wouldn&#39;t be able to accept any woman other than Vicky.  You suddenly knew that.  This under twenty girl had wrapped you around her finger these past weeks.  She would disappear into that barn with this boy...you knew that too; both of them excited by the power of your being taken by one of these stallions.<br />
You stood, stock still...stiffly.  No longer having anything of your own able to become stiff, you assumed a stiff legged, slightly splayed stance.  The males were almost done with their battles; one was approaching you.  His oddly mottled member extending and thickening beneath him.<br />
&quot;Two minute warning!&quot; the boy yelled out; Vicky slapped him playfully, laughing.<br />
<br />
A panic ran through you.  Yes, there was terror at the coming certainty of the approaching stallion but the panic was rising from the fear that time might run out...&quot;you&#39;d be ruined as far as any self respecting woman goes&quot;...Vicky&#39;s words raced through what was left of your mind.<br />
You turned yourself accessibly to the male.  You didn&#39;t know how to hurry things along...you were desperate so you tried all the tricks you&#39;d seen the other he-mares use, you heard Vicky calling out that you were making Michelle look like a prude as she laughed at your attempts to seduce a stallion orally.<br />
As you licked, spread and sprayed frantically the Stallion took his time, almost at points seeming disinterested, you knew that two minutes had passed but you continued on urgently.  Out of the corner of your eye, when the view wasn&#39;t completely blocked by a hanging testicle sac or the rear end of the male, you saw Vicky and her lover alternately paying attention to you and the stallion and to each other.<br />
<br />
Finally, you felt the male&#39;s attention focus solely on you; a feeling of pride swelled up inside you at that...he&#39;d chosen you!  You had value, you were worth his effort...he was mounting!<br />
<br />
And so he was.  Vicky pushed the boy away and both watched your mating unfold.  You backed and maneuvered your way beneath him accommodatingly, fully conscious of both your humanity and your masculinity in the moment.  Your body, your new, female, equine body wanted this...specifically to give to this stallion...&#39;Don&#39;t screw this up&#39; you heard it warning inside your own mind.<br />
This was no half breed hybrid, this was a full undiluted animal atop you.<br />
Vicky was watching, speechless...so you encouraged ourself.<br />
&#39;You get him inside you!&#39;...you pressed toward him each time you felt his tip near your drooling vaginal opening, desperately trying to line yourself up beneath him.  You tried, out of your mind with fear of failing, to spread yourself wider; aware that human male legs would be more flexible in that regard and wishing you would transform back so you could offer yourself more easily to this exquisite mate on your back.<br />
Then you felt it, a hand grabbing your erect tail as Vicky moved it to the side and using her own hair elastic to manage your tail.  And immediately you felt the thrilling surge of a cock&#39;s tip penetrating the opening of your vagina...realizing that it was Vicky guiding it in when her hand pressed your outer lips.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome Princess.&quot; and as she ran away to a protected distance, &quot;I hope he doesn&#39;t wreck you!&quot; shouted to you with a laugh.<br />
<br />
It was no idle hope.  This Stallion was beyond wild.  Somewhere in your head played images from porn movies you had watched, women in pain as the men rammed mercilessly into them...into you.  You were those porn women now.  The frenzied hammering drove your whole body forward.  You tried to raise your head to whinny in pain but it wouldn&#39;t be allowed up by the collar.  Your mate seemed infuriated by this failure and began savagely biting your neck.  You screamed, head lowered as a chunk of flesh was pulled off by his chomping teeth; this seemed to sate him a little for his ferocity tempered a tiny bit but he still raged inside of you.<br />
Wet as you were, sopping might better describe they flood of vaginal lubricants you produced to please this male beast and ease his entry inside of you, you felt the friction with each ferocious thrust.  Sometimes, when a dry spot exposed itself on the long thrust of his shaft you winced as it caught itself on the wall of your vagina and tore.  More and more this occurred, panicking your thoughts back to Vicky&#39;s words about how these stallions were male-to-filly killers.  They had fucked human mares to death...and now one was astride you driving his conquering penis in and out of you to subdue and claim you for his own.  Yes, you would soon be a mare forever and this Stallion atop you reveled in making you that, but he wanted more...you sensed that fully now.<br />
A shiver ran through you, you would remain fully aware!  He was wild and pure horse...you were giving yourself to him; Vicky had known.  She knew that these stallions fucked humans into mares.  She knew you would be Princess and remain aware and so did this stallion.<br />
His member drove in deeper, a sense of subordination overcame you...he was climaxing...inside you.  An intense submission welled up in you.  He would sire a foal in you, your body served this superior beast...he was your better.<br />
You were inferior to any stallion now.  You looked over to Vicky, neck straining against the collar...but no matter.  You were having no orgasm; the male atop you was...triumphantly, inside of you...seeding your womb...and that was what mattered.<br />
That was your purpose.  You &#39;knew&#39; many things, you could still reason to an extent...certainly beyond that of an equine nature; but your purpose was to take in the male and provide him a place to fertilize and plant a foal.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still understand me don&#39;t you girl?&quot; Vicky smiled.<br />
You shook your head.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s two plus two?&quot;<br />
You compliantly tapped your hoof four times.<br />
&quot;Good girl!&quot; a male voice piped up beside you.  A wave of humiliation surged through you.<br />
&quot;Ugh!  You are filthy with horse spunk.  We got it on video, so no one on the other side would miss it; you&#39;ve got to see the drippage coming out of that nasty cunt of yours.  I can&#39;t believe a sweet little foal will come out of that vile opening!&quot; then, kissing your head, &quot;You&#39;re such a tramp Princess!&quot;</p>
