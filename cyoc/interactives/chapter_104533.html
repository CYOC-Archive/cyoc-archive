<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Ryan nearly broke his alarm clock when he went to turn it off. He’d hit it so hard, at first he was certain he’d broken it. A small price to pay all things considered. Ryan was more interested in lying in bed a bit longer with his new tigress than getting up and preparing for the day.<br />
<br />
 It wasn’t like he had to be in early. The only reason he set the alarm in the first place was because he liked having a routine schedule. It’d been a long time since he’d spent an entire night fucking someone senseless. <br />
<br />
He rolled over, and almost off the bed. He and Claire had both fallen asleep after the last round of orgasms. Claire beneath him, Ryan was careful as he slid his wolf cock from her slit. Claire purred in her sleep as the knot was pulled free. Ryan gritted his teeth to keep from coming again. Claire looked so peaceful, he didn’t want to wake her. What’s the saying? Never wake a sleeping tiger? <br />
<br />
Didn’t matter how careful Ryan was being. Claire still woke up from her own orgasm. She blinked, her eyes taking in the light and her nose picking up the leftover scents from their wild night. <br />
<br />
“Morning.” Ryan said. He couldn’t help the wolfy grin he had on his face. In a very cat-like manner, Claire stretched and licked the dry cum from her fur. It was cute. <br />
<br />
“Morning. Oh, wow. Guess I owe you some new sheets.” Claire said, looking at the carnage around them. While Ryan was as much to blame, Claire couldn’t help but notice the long claw marks in the bedding, and the head board. <br />
<br />
“Eh, not that big of a deal. Totally worth it in my opinion,” Ryan leaned over to kiss Claire’s cheek, “So, how are you feeling?” <br />
<br />
“Great. Like… really great. I should have done this sooner.” Claire said, pointing to her black and white body. <br />
<br />
“Everyone makes the change at their own pace.” <br />
<br />
“I guess. Have to admit, wasn’t expecting this though. I didn’t even think tigers could be this color.” Claire said. She turned her head around so she could inspect her back. Her front was patterned with mostly soft white fur. But her back was covered in white stripes on black fur. Just like her arms, legs, and tail. The latter of which looked as though someone dipped it in white chocolate. Or cum. <br />
<br />
“Just means you’re special.” Ryan kissed her again. There was an odd, almost humming-like noise coming from somewhere in the room. Claire was about to ask Ryan if his heater was acting up or something. She was more than a little surprised when she realized SHE was making the sound. A new reflex Claire guessed. <br />
<br />
Another new reflex, Claire laid Ryan back against the bed and stared down at him with intense blue eyes. She started licking his chest, eventually finding his nipples hidden among layers of thick fur. <br />
<br />
“Does IT ever stop?” Claire asked between licks.<br />
<br />
“The heat? Well admittedly, it’s different for weres who are born weres. Not as intense and driving as yours probably is. But yes, it does stop. Care to see how long it takes for it to stop?” Ryan felt his rocket “prepare for take off”. He was soaking in a lot of the pheromones Claire was sending out into the air. It was making him just as “stir crazy” as he guessed she was. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to go to work?” she paused in her movement for a moment. <br />
<br />
“No, not until about 2. So I’m yours for the next eight or so hours.” <br />
<br />
“Grr-reat.” Claire said, purposely rolling the “R”. She stopped her licking, and positioned her hips over his. And again, thank god for soundproof walls. Tiger roars and wolf howls, not exactly the sort of wake up call most people would want. Of course this was Moon Lake, so odds were that Claire and Ryan weren’t the only ones enjoying their morning. <br />
<br />

 <br />
Eric and Nate both woke up and found their mom downstairs, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee, tapping her fingers away against the table. <br />
<br />
“Uh, you doing alright Mom?” Nate asked. Martha didn’t seem to hear them, so Nate spoke up louder. A little too loud, but at least it got his mom’s attention. <br />
<br />
“Oh, how long have you two been standing there?” Martha was jolted from her “trance”, and the cup in her hands shook. <br />
<br />
“Only a minute or so. How long have you been here?” Nate asked, while Eric got a towel to clean up the coffee his mochas split. <br />
<br />
“Thank you Eric,” Martha took the towel and then addressed Nate, “Honestly, I’m not sure. I woke in the middle of the night and couldn’t sleep. Nothing to worry about, just insomnia.” <br />
<br />
Well it WAS something to worry about, but not for her sons to worry about. Martha had been downstairs, trying to sort out her dreams. She couldn’t do it upstairs in her bedroom. It still reminded her too much of William. <br />
<br />
“Do you need us to get you anything?” Eric asked, seriously concerned about his mom, and by extension, the baby girl inside her. <br />
<br />
“No, I’ll be alright. You kids go and get ready for school.” she said. Reluctantly, they left. Martha looked at the clock that hung at the bottom of the staircase. “6:50” it read. She needed to be at the school by 8:00. So that would give her some time…. <br />
<br />
Martha went upstairs and hastily dressed herself. Then called to Eric and Nate that she’d be next door if they needed anything. While it wasn’t unusual for her to seek out the company of the Twists in the morning, Nate and Eric were a bit unsettled by the rash nature of their mom’s decision. <br />
<br />
“Do you think something’s wrong?” Eric asked Nate once they were dressed for school. <br />
<br />
“Maybe it’s a female thing.” Nate shrugged. That was his best and only guess. Because he had a feeling if there was something wrong, Martha would have told them. Unless it involved lady parts. In which case, both were glad Martha spared them.</p>
