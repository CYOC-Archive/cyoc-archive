<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;... You know what since you bring up Emily why don&#39;t we reminisce about her exactly?&quot; Doctor Doctor asked <br />
Krieg said &quot;Seriously removing those implants wou-&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes... I still remember that day quite well... I was feeling quite frisky that day. Then some pimp comes to my front door and brought in one of his whores who was recently mangled all over from a powered client... The pimp could tell I was interested in giving her some upgrades along with the general reconstruction, and I very much was but... I didn&#39;t like that and doubled his bill, he still considered it a worthwhile investment.&quot; <br />
&quot;Sure sure, and then the incident happ-&quot; <br />
&quot;Excuse me Krieg! I&#39;m telling the story and I will tell it the way I want to! I will live off these memories and you wont speak of these sessions to any living souls! I don&#39;t pay you those sums and give you rent to give advice!&quot; Doctor Doctor snapped and then said &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m a hero and shouldn&#39;t shout like that. Seriously though I&#39;m not doing surgery like that.... Where was I... Oh right the surgery.&quot; <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor got up and checked the drawers... The general scalpels were still there... along with the miscellaneous vials of random test drugs which probably couldn&#39;t be safely disposed of and probably couldn&#39;t be ethically used. Then continued &quot;Right the surgery... Done with that very scalpel. Plus other ointments, drugs, and threads... The trouble with the actual healing wasn&#39;t getting everything all the limbs back in the right direction and attached, but with making sure the nerves were connected right... However during that surgery I noticed either something had flattened them or the woman&#39;s chest was really small for a hooker.&quot; <br />
Krieg said &quot;Seriously Doctor, you can just call her Emily. We all know she&#39;s Emily and if you just liste-&quot; <br />
&quot;What kind of hooker doesn&#39;t have big breasts I thought!&quot; Doctor Doctor yelled &quot;So during the operation I&#39;d take a small break every now and then and... tinker... tinkering was a very nice calming thing for me... Still is, but now when I tinker I create things that save billions of lives... Then It was two tiny devices... I can&#39;t quite remember what I did to make them work, but when I was working on the torso well she wouldn&#39;t complain if I just slipped them into the chest region when saving her life.&quot; Doctor Doctor&#39;s pacing intensified &quot;I had made a single remote and when she woke up I showed her all the functions... and Pimp let me examine her and experiment.&quot; <br />
<br />
Krieg was happy that Doctor Doctor left out the details from his perspective. He had met with Emily once or twice after the incident. Krieg being sworn to secrecy about Doctor Doctor&#39;s villainous adventures made him one of the few people she could go to and talk things through. Krieg heard from her that when she woke up on that cold sterile table uncomfortable and her limbs still weak and aching from the treatments. Binds were not even necessary. She looked over as she heard clinking glasses and saw the Doctor pouring several glasses of milk, and he had a remote in his hands. <br />
Emily asked &quot;...What... did you do... to me?&quot; <br />
Doctor grinned and said &quot;Oh, I just noticed that for an... escort that&#39;s the proper term right? Yeah for an escort you weren&#39;t well endowed in the chest region. Now any two bit hack can just stuff fillers into your chest but I decided to try something different.&quot; The Doctor went up to Emily and grabbed her limp hand and arm and put her hand on her A-cup breast. The Doctor chuckled and said &quot;Any Doctor could make an implant that makes breasts bigger but how about one that&quot; *click* &quot;Makes them smaller!?!&quot; Emily couldn&#39;t see them but she could feel her chest shrink back into her chest. Emily was scared wondering what the madman had really done to her. *click* and the Doctor continued &quot;But of course it can also be made bigger&quot; Emily felt a squishy mass push against her hand and push. &quot;And bigger and bigger...&quot; she wouldn&#39;t have even needed to have her hand on her breast to know her breasts were giant as the weight of them on her body gave away how big the fleshy yoga balls were. Then she felt hands all over her right breast as the Doctor said &quot;Well I kinda know what breasts feel like... but I have no idea if the feeling of these large breasts are realistic you know?&quot; her own hand over her giant breasts was being pushed into it as the doctor asked &quot;...Does that feel about right?&quot; <br />
Emily breathing heavily said &quot;I... I guess?&quot; <br />
Emily could only hear the Doctor muttering something and then say &quot;And then an interesting function...&quot; *click* and suddenly Emily could feel something forming in her breast and then... something warm and wet started spraying from her nipples. &quot;On demand lactation. I could only imagine what people would pay for something like this... Both in your profession and maybe outside. First though I need to compare and contrast...&quot; Emily just had to lay on the cold table as the Doctor took sips from the milk glasses and sucked from her nipple which must&#39;ve been several times larger than normal somehow. &quot;...Not like this... Hey how about getting your opinion?&quot; Emily could feel her breasts enlarging after a *click* and then the Doctor shoved one of Emily&#39;s nipples into her own mouth and told to drink and compare. Neither of them knew why the doctor had Cow, Goat, Soy, and Rat milk available but Emily said her milk was probably the most similar to Cow milk. The whole ordeal had scared Emily shitless and all the growth and shrinking was rather unpleasant. He was a madman and even now when he was somewhat sane he considered all that a Pimp letting him examine her and experiment a little? <br />
<br />
Doctor Doctor had grabbed a glass and filled it with some water he sipped and said &quot;Then after all that I got my payment and made them leave... Then some idiot broke the remote, her implants malfunctioned, and then some skyscraper level breasts brought some hero attention to her. A tech hero managed to repair the remote and shrank them back down, and boy that search for my establishment. I managed to fool most and had to torture and kill &quot;Flip Flap&quot; I think his code name was. Then the whore ended up getting some charitable donations and got a better life for herself so it all worked out for her.&quot; <br />
Krieg said &quot;Seriously, Doctor if you just looked at this photo of her I have on-&quot; <br />
&quot;THE END! Krieg, that is the end of the story!&quot; *knock knock knock* &quot;And who have you given this address to?!?&quot; <br />
&quot;Emily Doctor, she was under the same gag order I&#39;m under and she needed someone to talk to. She has no interest in any of the experiments here so she sometimes comes to talk.&quot; <br />
&quot;Fine, let her in!&quot; <br />
Krieg opened the door and let in the woman with one beanbag sized breast, and a swollen pillow sized breast constantly leaking milk into some hose connected to a backpack. There was silence in the room for awhile. <br />
&quot;Krieg get the anesthetics ready and scalpels clean.&quot; <br />
Krieg grinned and said &quot;But Doctor weren&#39;t you sa-&quot; <br />
&quot;The Anesthetics and Scalpels Krieg! What do you think I&#39;m paying you for!?!&quot; Geese a surgery operation to modify someone was bad enough, but a failed experiment this bad? Well if word got out he could easily pay someone to spin the story as Doctor Doctor healing some deformity. At the end of the day Doctor Doctor was in his regular lab with two small devices trying to figure out what went wrong. Who really knows what would happen if anyone found at he had the implants... especially someone like Captain Spectacle or Red 6... Heck what was oracle going to say? She&#39;d probably have figured out he had the implants during the surgery somehow.</p>
