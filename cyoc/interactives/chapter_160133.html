<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, if anyone wants to be younger, it&#39;d be someone working out, I bet.&quot;  The tiny Goth sighed.  &quot;Let&#39;s go, Wish boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking his hand, Melissa pulled him towards the gym.  Bemused at being bossed around by such a little girl, Joey didn&#39;t resist, though he did shrink her another inch in size, to 4&#39; 4&quot;, which caused to pause and shudder.  She half turned to glare at him momentarily, but continued leading him along.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I should make you carry me.&quot;  Melissa groused.<br />
<br />
In response, Joey scooped his girlfriend up into a bridal carry, delighted at how perfectly tiny and light she was.  Melissa kicked and squealed in surprise, but settled down, comfortable in his arms.  &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I like this.  We should do this the next time I&#39;m a kid.  People would stare less.&quot;  Even as she said that, Joey noticed he and Melissa were eliciting some odd stares.<br />
<br />
Joey frowned.  &quot;Well, we&#39;ll see about that.  I wish all the girls in this hotel would shrink to three quarters their current height.  Their clothing will change with them, and no one but the two of us will notice the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Joey, no, you...&quot;  Melissa watched as the women around her shrank...then gasped as she herself began to dwindle more, going from 4&#39; 4&quot; to 3&#39; 3&quot; in moments.  No longer able to contain herself, she began to moan, one hand reaching for her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot;  Joey felt Melissa grow lighter in his arms.  &quot;Every girl in this hotel will have an intense orgasm!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa keened loudly, bucking in his arms, and he rushed into a bathroom.  Fortunately, the sounds of loud moaning all around provided a distraction so no one was paying him or Melissa much mind.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Joey locked the door.  Seeing a changing table, he opened it and placed Melissa on it, helping her remove her panties.  Without a care in the world, the shrunken girl began to finger herself, even as she clutched her blouse, desperately trying to reach a breast.<br />
<br />
Joey wished her clothes away, then turned her body to face him, as he leaned in close and pulled her hand away from her pussy.  Melissa growled cutely at him, but he responded by leaning in close, and using his tongue to pleasure her tiny pussy.  This intensified her orgasm even more, and she bucked and kicked at him until her back arched and she went limp.<br />
<br />
Joey finished cleaning her up, enjoying her taste immensely, then picked her up gently, holding her close.  She cuddled into his embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;You moron...Goddess, that was amazing.  You do realize though, you might have caused more than one accident with an orgasm like that, like, what if someone in the pool is drowning right now?&quot;  She scolded him, her voice sounding tired and weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, ok, anyone who came to any harm or danger in the past fifteen minutes in the hotel is perfectly safe and fine!&quot;  He quickly wished,<br />
<br />
&quot;Better, Wish boy.  Of course, what about all those preteens who just came for the first time?  Idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey&#39;s eyes got wide.  &quot;Oh fuck, uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached up and touched his cheek.  &quot;Relax, it&#39;ll probably be fine.  Just think before you wish, ok?  Dummy.  Now kiss me, put some clothes on me, and we&#39;ll go to the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Boss.  Uh, should I make you bigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
She made a face.  &quot;I want to say no, because this is neat, but I&#39;m definitely way too small now.  Unless...keep me the same size, but make me four.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey blinked.  &quot;Uh, sure thing.&quot;  He made the wish, and watched her proportions change, and her features become that of a very young child.<br />
<br />
Melissa giggled.  &quot;Clothes, dummy, unless you want to get arrested.  And not the goth outfit, it would stand out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;  Joey wished a cute outfit onto Melissa, a red blouse and pink skirt, with white frilly lace.  A large red bow around her waist, tied in the back, white bobby socks, and black-and-white saddle shoes.  Her hair was done up into fancy curls, with a large pink bow.  He set her onto a stool that wasn&#39;t there a moment ago, so she could easily see herself in the mirror above the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow.  I&#39;m fucking adorable.&quot;  Melissa turned to one side, then another, swishing her skirt as she did so.  &quot;Too damn young, but I like it.&quot;  Her voice was clear and high-pitched, and she turned to look at him.  &quot;Ok, &#39;Daddy&#39;, pick me up again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, he scooped her up into his arms.  She shivered.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is kind of weird, I should be way too young to feel aroused, but I&#39;m tingly all over.  I feel so naughty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey kissed her forehead gently.  &quot;Do you like feeling naughty?&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;Do I ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
He left the bathroom, his little princess in his arms.  Outside, there was no sign of any girls, and the few men about looked confused and aroused.  Heeding them no mind for the impressive case of blue balls they no doubt suffered from, he headed to the gym.<br />
<br />
The only occupant was a young man about his own age.  He was wearing a light blue tracksuit, and had glasses.  Short brown hair, and sad, grey eyes.  Instead of working out, he was seated on a bench, staring at his smart phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, put me down, please.&quot;  Melissa said, gently.<br />
<br />
Joey put her down, and she slowly walked up to the man.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mister, why are you sad?&quot;  She looked up at him with big, innocent eyes.<br />
<br />
Joey didn&#39;t want to intrude on this scene, so he wandered over to some free weights, keeping an eye on the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey there.  Wow, you&#39;re really cute, huh?&quot;  The guy wiped away some tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what everyone says.  Hey, she&#39;s really pretty!&quot;  Melissa pointed at the screen of the smart phone, which displayed the picture of a smiling blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...she is.&quot;  The man sighed.  &quot;She was my girlfriend, but she broke up with me.  She wants to be with someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa stamped her foot.  &quot;That&#39;s dumb!  You seem really nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, thanks.  I&#39;m Marc, with a C.  What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
She beamed at him.  &quot;Missy.  That&#39;s my Daddy over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He looks young to have a girl your age.  Is he a good Daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Missy nodded.  &quot;Uh-huh.  He carries me when I get tired.  Do you wish you weren&#39;t sad, Marc with a C?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, actually.  But that&#39;s not how it works, you know.  It&#39;ll take time.  I hope nobody ever breaks your heart, Missy.&quot;  He ruffled her hair gently.  <br />
<br />
Missy blushed a little.  &quot;Daddy says I&#39;m too young to worry about boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marc laughed.  &quot;Well, he&#39;s not wrong.  Maybe it&#39;s for the best, boys can be jerks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy&#39;s not a jerk!  I don&#39;t think you are, either.  And girls can be jerks too.&quot;  Missy nodded.  &quot;Not me though, I&#39;m a good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey tried not to laugh out loud, focusing on his impromptu workout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are.  Maybe one day a good girl will want to be my girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
She beamed up at him.  &quot;I&#39;d be your girlfriend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m a bit too old for you, Missy.  Your Dad wouldn&#39;t approve.&quot;  Marc laughed nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, I can fix that, I have magic powers.&quot;  Missy nodded sagely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?&quot;  Marc looked at her, dubiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  She chirped.  &quot;I can make you young again!  Then we can play together!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, well I don&#39;t know, aren&#39;t little boys yucky?&quot;  Marc chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.  Yeah.  I know, what if I made you a little girl?  You&#39;d be so pretty!&quot;  Missy grinned.<br />
<br />
Quietly, Joey began to wish.  &quot;Marc would be happy to be a pretty girl.  He wouldn&#39;t mind being younger, with a new start.  He wouldn&#39;t freak out at being changed, just surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marc blinked.  &quot;Well, what would you call me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Missy looked thoughtful.  &quot;Marcy!  You&#39;d be Marcy, and you&#39;d be my friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marc nodded slowly.  &quot;But who&#39;d take care of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Daddy and Elly would!  She&#39;s like a big sister...sort of.  I promise, you&#39;ll be happy.&quot;  She held out a pinky.<br />
<br />
Marc laughed, and made the pinky promise.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now!  Magic powers, make Marc into Marcy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pink sparkling lights surrounded Marc, whose eyes widened, but he seemed more awestruck than frightened as the magic changed him.  He shrank in size dramatically, while his hair lengthened, becoming a chestnut color, and his features softened, becoming feminine.  His tracksuit changed size with him, becoming a pink color.  The glasses shrank, and his eyes...her eyes...remained grey, but seemed larger.<br />
<br />
And in moments, Marc was now Marcy, a pretty girl of 7.  Marcy blinked a few times, looking at her hands.  &quot;Wh...what?  I really changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking Marcy&#39;s hands in her smaller ones, Missy turned so Marcy could see herself in a mirror.  &quot;See?  See?  You&#39;re pretty!&quot;<br />
<br />
And she was, with long chestnut hair that fell well below her waist.  A rare beauty, who would grow into a real heartbreaker one day.  Marcy put a hand on her cheek, amazed.  &quot;Is this real?  I...don&#39;t feel sad anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised you&#39;d be happy, Marcy.  Come on, let&#39;s go to my room, you can meet my friend, Elly!  She&#39;s closer to your age!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey followed the two girls as Missy pulled her new friend along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, another mouth to feed.  I wonder what else Missy has in mind?&quot;</p>
