<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob Van Direstag was on his bed in his room, his eyes staring at the ceiling.  His mind was replaying what he saw earlier that evening when Shelia visited the family.  He remembered her stripping in the foyer of the family home.  He remembered the shape of her breasts as she removed her bra, the shape of her waist and hips as she pulled off her pants.  He even remembered the small patch of hair between Shelia&#39;s legs as she stood nude before changing.  He groaned as he turned over.  He could feel his penis being painfully stiff as he couldn&#39;t get the image out of his head.  As much as he liked Amy, he couldn&#39;t help but feel attracted to Shelia as he remembered the shape of her body, and he didn&#39;t know how to handle it.  He got up from his bed and made his way to the bathroom to get ready for bed.  Maybe a good night&#39;s sleep will help relieve him of the images in his mind.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Frank was in his room as he finished writing his reports and his homework.  He was preparing to return the laptop back to the school and his mind wandered back to the events of the day.  He remembered the cute girl from the bookstore and idly wondered if he&#39;d see her again.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Rachel stretched her arms as she finished her stream for the night.  She could hear Rob going to the bathroom as she closed her programs and turned off the computer.  Her mind went over the day as she bit her lip.  The day started out normally when she went to school, but then she went with Melissa to her house.  Melissa showed her werecow self, and Rachel was a bit impressed with it.  After that, she went to the hospital to see about getting birth control pills, but the pharmacy was closed for the night.  After that, she made her way home when she got...distracted by something in the woods.  She saw a couple of werefoxes going at it and then she met with Megumi.  Rachel could feel her face flush as she lost count of how many orgasms she had since then.  She then went over to the Tachibana household where things really heated up.  When she saw Aaron as she was getting out of the shower, she couldn&#39;t say what came over her.  One moment, she saw him as she was getting out of the shower.  Something came over her as she walked up to Aaron, wrapped her legs around him, and gave her virginity to him.  Her body started to feel warm as she remembered what happened next as the two of them started to have sex.  Had Megumi not interrupted them, Rachel was sure she would have been a werefox.  Luckily, Megumi was able to get them decoupled as he came, but it was still an open question if Megumi got Aaron out in time.  They said that Rachel still smelled human, so it seemed that the answer was yes.<br />
<br />
Rachel took a breath as she continued to think.  She had a couple of close calls so far, and both times, things seemed to be out of her control.  If what she heard about the werefox bond was true, it was only a matter of time before she lost her humanity and turned.  While she could accept that, it would have to be on her terms, and not on some fluke or forces beyond her control.  She had made a decision and wanted to act on it now before anything else happened.  It was at that point she had a crazy idea.<br />
<br />
She grabbed her coat and made her way quietly downstairs.  Rob was still in the bathroom and Frank was still in his room.  As she quietly went downstairs, she noted that her parents weren&#39;t back yet.  She opened the front door and went through it into the cold night air.  As she closed the door, she could hear the various night activities going on in the woods.  A part of her wondered if she was doing something stupid right now, while another part of her reasoned that she was just asserting her choice.  As she walked out into the front yard, she could see the Tachibana Estate next door and the woods behind her house.  Her eyes then went across the street to the woods there and decided to walk over there.  After taking a quick look to make sure that there weren&#39;t any cars coming, she walked quickly across the street and into the woods.  As she walked deeper into the woods, the lights from the houses were dimmed out by the trees, and it was nearly pitch dark.  About two hundred feet into the forest, she stopped.  In that part of the woods, she couldn&#39;t really see anything other than the lights of the houses on the road.  She could hear growls and moans, however, all around her, and she knew exactly what was going on in those woods.  A small part of her urged her to go back home and forget this, but a large part of her wanted to continue on.<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath and then called out, &quot;Um...I want to be turned...to a werebear.  Anyone out there that can help me?&quot;  She could feel her face flush as she said this.  In a way, it was sort of embarrassing, but she did it anyway.  She wasn&#39;t sure what kind of response she&#39;d get if she got one at all.  After waiting a couple of minutes, she turned around and started to walk home.</p>
