<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once you all had your shoes on and everyone was happy with how they felt on their longer feet, Grace and Lucy hurry off to college they didn’t want to be late since their teacher was a real pain with tardiness.<br />
<br />
Zoe decides to take her new boots for a test drive and heads off to the shopping district to find a new jacket to fit with her new boots and to show them off a small sense of pride bubbling in her with them.<br />
<br />
You on the other hand had a free period from college that morning so you didn’t have much else to do for a couple hours, your mum opens the front door and glances back to you with a smile.<br />
<br />
“You want to come for a jog with me? Just around the neighbourhood that’s all” she offers you.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I have nothing to do till later” you reply stepping over to the door, your shoes felt pretty good on your feet with each step you took.<br />
<br />
The morning jog felt good to invigorate you, the crisp fresh air in your lungs and the warm morning sun beaming down on your exposed skin, it was also peaceful, no traffic around for a good few miles, your mum was jogging in front leading the way on the route she had planned.<br />
<br />
But after a good solid twenty minutes of jogging around the neighbourhood you both come to a stop, your mum checks her watch.<br />
<br />
“It’s only 9:30 you want to keep going?” she asks.<br />
<br />
You think for a moment and nod, the exercise felt good and it had been waking you up more than a cup of coffee would do, so your mum leads you on another trip around the neighbourhood just as some of your neighbours were leaving for work.<br />
<br />
As you continue your jog you pass by Nadia one of your neighbours, she was a member of your mums’ book club but relationships were strained between her and your mum after it came to light that Nadia was a kleptomaniac.<br />
<br />
 She had swiped small things from other members of the book club when they hosted at their homes, Nadia never hosted since she knew she would have been exposed but she was caught in the act one day so she was kicked from the book club.<br />
<br />
She stares at you her eyes glued to both yours and your mums’ feet, puzzled by how they look, but to you as you notice her you weren’t sure if she was admiring your new footwear or staring at your strange looking feet.<br />
<br />
You don’t say anything and continue on, you both pass by Derek he is one of the only younger people in the area, he is a college drop out that lives with his girlfriend Ashley, you and Derek used to hang out before he got with Ashley.<br />
<br />
Ashley is a rather boisterous girl, she always speaks over people and gets excited rather easily, she loves rabbits and has a couple in the backyard, you can’t help but think how she would react to seeing Eric and Luke.<br />
<br />
The thought makes you chuckle a little as you give Derek a wave and he waves back he doesn’t pay much attention to your feet since he turns away after waving a newspaper in his hand.<br />
<br />
You begin to notice your mum is leading you on a dirt trail at the back of the neighbourhood, being so far out of the way the neighbourhood had a few nature trails and fields nearby.<br />
<br />
“Why are we heading off the street?” you ask.<br />
<br />
“Just wanted a change of scenery plus Nadia will just harass us” she responds.<br />
<br />
You take in the tranquil scenery of the green grass and the soft rustling trees, your sneakers feeling really comfortable as you press them into the soft dirt with each step, you glance down at your phone which you have taken out.<br />
<br />
“I really should start heading back it’s only an hour till my next class” you say breaking the silence.<br />
<br />
You both come to a stop and your mum turns around catching her breath.<br />
<br />
“Really? What time is it?” she asks looking down to her watch noticing it was 10am.<br />
<br />
“Miss Stillglass will be rather angry if I’m late for my first class today” you say preparing to head back home to change.<br />
<br />
“Well you could head to class, or we could remain here in the field all day” she says to you.<br />
<br />
You shake your head “I have to meet with Kate for lunch too” you reply.<br />
<br />
Your mum pouts a little before she starts walking back home with you, you felt a little guilty since your mum seemed eager to just laze around the field all day.<br />
<br />
“We can do that on my next day off if you’d like” you offer her.<br />
<br />
“Sure, I might go back there at lunch and just relax there for a while” your mum says back as you make your way back to the street.<br />
<br />
As you arrive back you pass by Eric and Luke’s house, Luke was laying on a sunbed on the front lawn he was reading a book when he notices you both walking past.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hey the shoes any good?” he calls out.<br />
<br />
“Yeah really comfy” you reply with a smile wiggling your toes a little in your sneakers.<br />
<br />
Luke sits up and puts his book down “you look like you’ve had a good run, you need a drink?” he asks.<br />
<br />
Your mum nods her head wiping her brow a little “oh yes please it’s quite warm this morning” she says.<br />
<br />
Luke motions you to follow him inside which you do “Eric isn’t home right now, he took off after dropping the boxes of shoes off, he wants to check out a human salon and see how it compares to a rabbit one” he says.<br />
<br />
Luke heads into the kitchen and soon returns with two glass bottles, he hands them to you both, the contents were white with a slight yellow tint, you look at it before looking up to Luke.<br />
<br />
“It’s a vanilla and banana protein drink, home made we don’t really sell this stuff, the health drinks are different to this” Luke says explaining the drinks.<br />
<br />
You open the lid and sniff it, sure enough you can smell banana and a hint of vanilla mixed in, the banana most likely giving it the slight yellow tint, your mum is already drinking it down in large gulps, you decide to do the same.<br />
<br />
It tastes really good “you should sell this too, a lot of people working out would pay to have something this good going down their throats” you say after finishing the bottle.<br />
<br />
Luke chuckles “I’ll talk it over with Eric, if you plan on doing more of these jogs we can whip up a batch of protein drinks, just name what flavours you like and we’ll see about making that happen” he says.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take a couple of strawberry flavoured” your mum says.<br />
<br />
“I’ll have a couple of these and chocolate” you say.<br />
<br />
Luke nods memorizing what you want before taking the bottles back, you begin heading to the front door your mum deciding to hang out with Luke for a while.<br />
<br />
You head home and get yourself changed before grabbing your stuff and heading off to college to try and make the start of the first class for the day.</p>
