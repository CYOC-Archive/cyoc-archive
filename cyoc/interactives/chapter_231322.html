<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob Moreland is out at an old abanoned mine shaft having just finished setting up some C4 within, with some hired help, who he told was for some government work. Once  the job was done, Jacob sent the man on his way and looked at his watch. He had made his prescence known to the Normal a few nights ago, he hoped whoever followed his trail was someone he could be pretty pissed off at. He knew they were going to send someone tough to face him. Jacob then heard some voices and was about to hide, when he suddenly heard a voice call out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?! Oh my god, dad!&quot; Jacob heard the unmistakable voice of his first son, Caleb say to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, not now son.&quot; Jacob said under his breath as Caleb ran up to his dad and gave him a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, how are you....? Why are you....? Do you know what you&#39;ve been putting us all through? I thought you were dead when the house blew up.&quot; Caleb said and noticed his father was wearing a prostehtic arm too.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you finally got another arm.&quot; Caleb joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted them to think I was dead, that was the plan. I managed to have a teleportation stone on me and got the hell out of dodge real fast. To lay low for a while. But that wasn&#39;t enough, I&#39;ve still got unfinished business to do.&quot; Jacob said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfinished...? Dad come on, your business is finished. You can retire, watch Chase and Charlotte grow up, grow old together with mom. You can die peacefully.&quot; Caleb said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Die peacefully?! You think I want to just sit my ass back in my chair at home waiting for some villain of the week or the next so-called supremacist try and kill you, or your siblings, or god help me, your own mother. They&#39;ve been trying to take me out for years now. Whether it&#39;s vampires, or the Normal, there&#39;s always going to be someone who wants to kill Jacob Moreland. I&#39;m not going to sit on the sidelines anymore, what I&#39;m going to to, I&#39;m going to do for you and everyone I care and love for.&quot; Jacob said as Evan turned his head and used some binoculars he had on him to see a figure in the distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s coming, and they&#39;ll be here pretty soon.&quot; Evan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it dad, come on, let me help you out on this one. Just like old times, me and you on one of your outings.&quot; Caleb suggested as Jacob took a deep breath and a sigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Those were good times. You and me, hunting them and spending some family time together. Tell me, you think you&#39;ll ever settle down with Gloria?&quot; Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, of course dad, one day. I do really love her. She really helps bring out the best in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve also noticed Spark also brings out the best in Connor and he in turn seems to bring out Spark&#39;s softer side. Hell, maybe they&#39;ll get married before you.&quot; Jacob laughed before he turned back to Caleb now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen: take good care of your mother, give Connor my love, and when the twins grow up. Tell them that their dad was a hero. I&#39;ve also left some video recordings at S.P.E.A.R, the password is &#39;Nina&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, come on, you know I can&#39;t let you do this alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and I&#39;ll always love that about you.&quot; Jacob says as he gives Caleb a hug which Caleb smiles at as his dad slowly ends before he gives his son a smile at before punching Caleb hard in the face knocking him unconscious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you do that for?&quot; Evan asked surprsied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love my son, but he was never going to let me do this alone. Listen, I know he&#39;ll want to follow or help me out and I&#39;m going to tell you this now: don&#39;t. What I&#39;m about to do is for me and me alone.&quot; Jacob says as Evan nods his head.<br />
<br />
Jacob now took out a flare to direct the stranger&#39;s position. As the figure got closer, Jacob could see that it was none other than Villar who had found him.<br />
<br />
Evan did as Jacob asked and didn&#39;t follow him remaining behind with the unconcsious Caleb.<br />
<br />
Just as Jacob ran into the mine shaft, he took out his disponsable phone and sent a text on before breaking it.<br />
<br />
Villar now followed Jacob into the mine shafts, before he can do anything to him, Jacob sets off a set of explosives that block the entrance they came in and surprising Villar for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what old man? You&#39;re trapped in here with me. There&#39;s no where left to run.&quot; Villar says glaring at Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Jacob simply says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you....oh my god, you...? Ha, ha, you actually think you&#39;re going to make it out of this situation?&quot; Villar asks as Jacob Moreland looks at him with a bold and stern face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you&#39;re actually going through with this.&quot; Villar realizes. Villar then looks around the mine shaft to see an uncountable number of C4 around the mine shafts.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you....you must be bluffing, there&#39;s no way you&#39;d leave your allies and especially your own family behind like this.&quot; Villar theorizes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? I&#39;ve got a question for you: What I&#39;m about to do is retribution for what happened to my son&#39;s Connor&#39;s friend&#39;s parents. Yeah I know they died saving their daughter&#39;s life after Rick stole the girl&#39;s magic. So tell me, am I in the right for wanting to take these bastards with me so they can&#39;t do any more harm to anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Come on, you&#39;re mad, you&#39;ve got to see this from a logical point of view.&quot; Villar tries to rebuke.<br />
<br />
Jacob still holds his ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me you old bastard, you&#39;ve just gone a little insane from being apart from your family.&quot; Villar argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I have, maybe I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve seen so much shit in this world and people hurting others. It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re young or old, it&#39;s cruel either way. My time has been growing shorter as of late and this was my one last hurrah. To take down even just one member of the Normal with me. What I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t just to end my life, but to exchange it for another. I was told some kids just lost their mother, and that&#39;s just sad. A child deserves their mother more than anything. You think you&#39;re in the right, but no one ever knows if they&#39;re in the right until they&#39;re tested. I&#39;ve been tested time and time again, and this time....I&#39;m going to let death win for the sake of my family and the next generation. Don&#39;t you agree with me?&quot; Jacob said holding up his final trigger on the button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your reasoning, Jacob Moreland.....is sound.&quot;  Villar replied as Jacob smiled and pushed the trigger button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you and all your family, Jacob Moreland.&quot; Villar said just as the explosions went up.<br />
<br />
Jacob Moreland slowly opens his eyes as he looks around to see he appears in what looks like a lodge. He then hears a bell ring, and sits up as the ring becomes insistent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, good, you&#39;re awake Jacob Moreland? I&#39;ve got to be honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting what you did to be so dramatic, but honestly being a Moreland, you&#39;re always going to be up for some theatrics.&quot; The man behind the desk said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....I remember you. You&#39;re...&quot; Jacob could hardly say the name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Death, yeah, I know, a lot of people usually are like this on the other side.&quot; Death said as Jacob stood up with his arms and suddenly came to realize that he had both of his arms again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really am dead this time, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Jacob said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did agree to our terms. Your soul for the girl Mika&#39;s, my wife&#39;s just collecting her now.&quot; Death said as she walking by carrying Mika&#39;s soul, it looked like a ball of light of different colors that never stopped moving and changing with every instant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just love it, when I bring a soul back for a second round at life.&quot; Life said as she left Jacob and her husband behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, it&#39;s about time you got here, you stubborn old bastard.&quot; Jacob heard a familiar voice say as he turned around to see his father, Victor Moreland standing there with his grandfather, Malcolm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad? Grandad? It&#39;s great to see you.&quot; Jacob said putting his arms around the two of them for a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...had ghosts tell me some time ago that you two were watching out for me.&quot; Jacob said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course we have, you dummy. You, Nina, and all those little ones.&quot; Malcolm said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do....do you know, if they&#39;ll be alright without me?&quot; Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
Victor and Malcolm looked at each other then back at Jacob.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll have what we&#39;ve all had, the family drama, the family training, your youngest boy&#39;s romance with the vampire girl down the line.....&quot; Malcolm said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My what?!&quot; Jacob asked surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that. That&#39;s further down the line. Just.....just know son, that your own sons, your daughter, they&#39;re all in good hands. Now tell me: did you have a good life?&quot; Victor asked his son.<br />
<br />
Jacob now thought back on his whole life up until that point. The good, the bad, and everything in between.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did dad, I had a good life. I wouldn&#39;t have changed anything in the world for it.&quot; Jacob answered with a smile.<br />
<br />
************************************************<br />
<br />
Back on earth, Nina was in the children&#39;s bedroom with Julia and had just finished changing the twins diapers whilst Julia was rocking Tammy to sleep, when she got a text notification from an uknown number and all it read was:<br />
<br />
&#39;My last crusade.&#39; It also had a heart next to it. Nina knew now that definitively, Jacob Moreland was indeed dead. Nina couldn&#39;t hold back her tears as she sat down and began to cry with Julia sitting down next to her and giving her sister-in law a reassuring hug for what seemed like a long time.</p>
