<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Ava could reach the bathroom door, though, she then overheard her father say something that then caught her attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you two get into anything this morning... could you do us a favor, son?&quot; Kent Ross asked, making Ava stop where she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dad,&quot; came Connor&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we see the &quot;new&quot; you?&quot; Kent asked, &quot;and Ava as well... as there is some curiosity on our part, and possibly on Ava&#39;s part as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d make some sense,&quot; Ryan responded, &quot;while we are still human as weres, you&#39;ll probably find yourself preferring to be in your fursona rather than in your human form. We often have to during the day, to protect Moon Lake&#39;s secret, but that&#39;s with regard to being outside. Inside is a different issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Tad said it was okay to be transformed while inside,&quot; Connor replied.<br />
<br />
Ava stood by carefully listening as her brother then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose I could,&quot; Connor continued, &quot;is Ava up? Or...&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough to get Ava to decide to come downstairs. She already knew about Connor having wrestled with the question of his sexuality and had even challenged him on it and why he didn&#39;t share it with the family. Her initial retreat had been more about avoiding the appearance of spying on her brother. Though with that line of conversation at the end was enough to give her an opening to come into the conversation without coming off as spying. She&#39;d have to play it rather sly, but she figured she could manage it. She came down the stairs and then turned toward the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I what?&quot; Ava spoke, feigning grogginess, and then noting Connor&#39;s location in the room beside Ryan, and then moved to hug him, &quot;You&#39;re back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I would,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;things got bit more... enjoyable, in a way, and I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t get back in time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay,&quot; Ava told her brother, &quot;and you got everything set up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Connor answered and returned the hug, &quot;and a werewildcat now... and I&#39;ve gotten all the answers I need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor released Ava as she looked up to him and gave a happy smile at that. Though a soft clearing of a throat made him turn his head to see that Diana Ross had come stand closer to her husband and he noted a bit of a look of hope and worry on her face, which reminded him on some of the issues that had related to his own questions on his sexuality. He&#39;d never been sure on things completely, and while he had the sense that his family would support him, he&#39;d wanted to be able to figure things out on his own, though, he&#39;d also ultimately found he needed help from Tad, Ryan, and Amy regarding that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answers?&quot; Diana said slowly.<br />
<br />
Connor managed a small smile, &quot;Yeah... you and dad have known on this, and Ava&#39;s probably been smart enough to notice some things on her own... but I&#39;ve had questions as to whether or not I was gay or straight... or bi. There were things that I&#39;ve felt that went in one direction or another, but I&#39;d never had full confirmation on that. Sometimes I&#39;d see a woman who I found pretty and then at times I&#39;d see a man that I&#39;d found handsome. And I wanted to find answers on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d always love you, son,&quot; Diana interrupted to insist on showing her love to her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I still wanted to find the answers for myself,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;and in meeting with Ryan... I&#39;ve begun to find the answers. Some of which I confirmed last night, after my transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
This caught Ryan&#39;s attention as he remembered drifting off to sleep with Connor next to him on the bed. This had to have been something that happened in the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;In this, by going out with Ryan there should be no doubt that I am attracted to men,&quot; Connor spoke, &quot;but I checked on something in the night, which were just some photos from the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, and I&#39;ll admit that they looked good too. Which confirms what Ryan has suspected from some of our conversations... That I&#39;m bisexual... into both men and women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that,&quot; Kent assured him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Connor nodded and looked over to Ryan who gave a reassuring smile, &quot;and in a way... it&#39;s good to have answers to that question now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Diana felt all the internal tensions flooding out of her, &quot;though... we would still like to see the &quot;new&quot; you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded and moved over the couch to remove his socks and shoes. With Ava there, he&#39;d stay in his clothing, though from what he&#39;d noted from the previous night and earlier in the morning when he and Ryan had gotten up, Connor didn&#39;t think his fursona was that much bigger than his human form. It was something that then related to things that he&#39;d remembered from earlier conversations with Ryan and to a degree even with Tad. He sat down and undid the laces and then pulled off his socks before setting both down on the floor in front of the couch. He&#39;d still have to change clothes, as the clothes he was presently wearing, which were there for the date the previous night, could probably stand to be washed, but he could change later. He merely focused on his fursona and wanting to be in that form.<br />
<br />
Ava meanwhile moved around the back of the couch to stand by her parents as Connor then stood up from it, though as he stood up, Ava noted on how Connor actually stood on his toes. At the same time, silver grey fur seemed to grow out on his feet and hands, while his toenails and fingernails lengthened into claws and then retracting beneath the growing fur. Ava had some degree of awe on her face as she watched Connor grow a bit taller as his feet lengthened, and beneath his clothes she could see him tone out a bit more, though not by too much. In this, his clothing didn&#39;t tear. Though at the same time, as the transformation progressed and his ears moved up to the top of his head, his face pushed forward into a rounded feline muzzle, and his cheek fur grew out long and thick, there was one point where it looked like Connor was a bit uncomfortable. That appeared to be at the back of his pants, and Connor pulled them down a bit to expose a short silver-gray furred tail that was tipped by some black fur on its tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that feels good,&quot; Connor managed to smile as the turned to his family and noted that they hadn&#39;t fled or did anything. They remained together and he thought he could see small smiles on his parents&#39; faces. &quot;So... what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t the tail be longer?&quot; Ava wondered, &quot;kitties have long tails.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all cats... and particularly among the Lynx and its relatives,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;my form is based on the Canada Lynx, which has a short tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava came forward and ran her hand down Connor&#39;s forearm with some curiosity and was pleased to find it soft. Though as her hands started to move down toward Connor&#39;s hands, but she went no further that that. Connor inwardly sighed at that, as a part of him feared accidently clawing her. For werewildcat instincts told him that if he were to try this with any woman, he&#39;d accidently kill that woman. He also knew that as a werewildcat, one of two were species in Moon Lake known to be at least bisexual, if not completely homosexual. In this, even if Ava was male, if he were to turn Ava he&#39;d also change Ava&#39;s sexuality, which Connor didn&#39;t want to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the fur is soft and you do look good,&quot; Ava said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sis,&quot; Connor responded then hugged his sister again while nuzzling Ava&#39;s cheeks with his muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that tickles!&quot; Ava answered with a small chuckle, &quot;but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy.&quot; She then paused to look to Ryan, who was standing by calmly behind Connor, &quot;and you&#39;ll be good to him right? He is my only brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ryan answered.</p>
