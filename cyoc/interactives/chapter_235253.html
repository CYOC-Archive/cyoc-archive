<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A man was looking for an engagement ring. The blessed ring had been melted down and forged into different shapes. But the magic Rasputin had put into it was still powerful long after his death. Whether he was working for the Devil or Christ it ultimately didn&#39;t matter. Chet was a twenty something year old. He had a girlfriend he wanted to propose to, like most Americans he married young. It was a lingering trait from the conservative nature of the country. Trump was in charge and fucking things up. Chet lived in Georgia, if Hitler had the Republic ticket they would still vote for him. He was thinking about taking Sarah and moving up the coast to New Jersey or Washington state if they could afford it. <br />
<br />
Sarah was older than he was, a MILF. But he loved her maturity. She had a thin but plain and honest face, a cute button nose inside a round oval  shaped face. Two bright blue eyes that seemed as deep as the Pacific Ocean, her hair was dyed blond (the carpet did not match the drapes) but she wore it a wavy 60s style that she made look so sexy. Her breasts were small but so was the rest of her, she had a petite figure. She wanted kids and at age 33 the biological clock was ticking. She was a British actress from London, she had come to the US to star in Hollywood but ended up in the local theater, she made a lot working on stage in Athens, Atlanta and she had taught drama at the same college Chet was going to. <br />
<br />
Marriage had been something that you just asked a woman for. But some company had said you needed a ring and that followed since old times. But did it have to be a ring? His uncle had died and he had money for two items, a small ring and something else. What about a chain around her ankle? He&#39;d read somewhere that an ankle chain was just like a ring on the left hand. He wanted Sarah to be his woman, she would be marked as MARRIED with a ring on the finger and a chain around her ankle!<br />
<br />
Giddy with happiness he purchased a ring with a diamond in it and ankle chain. He stored them inside his wardrobe. As he was laying in bed he started having wet dream but he was not Chet but a woman. She wanted to get fucked by this guy who she had invited into her room. She had grabbed his hand and guided it into her shirt, she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra. She put a hand down the front of his pants searching for his cock, it was hard like wood. He pitched her nipple and she gasped, it had been so long since she had been touched. The mouths intertwined as they kissed like horny teenagers in the back of a car. Her body was on fire and his cock was the fire hose. <br />
<br />
&quot;What about protection?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m on the pill.&quot; she lied.<br />
<br />
They stumbled backwards he was tearing at her shirt now exposing her boobs to the chilly air. His kisses were strong and forced the taste of his mouth wash into her mouth, he had come prepared. She could feel heat coming in waves from crotch of his pants. Her clothes and his were shed like a snake&#39;s skin. Her lover was powerful, she felt weightless in his arms rippling with muscle. He placed her on the bed and he straddled her body. His body was sticky with sweat, he pushed her into the mattress which groaned under their combined weight. Was it was a place that wasn&#39;t her home, she was meeting this guy on the side. <br />
<br />
She looked at her nude body, the small breasts, toned stomach and the small patch of hair between her legs. Her lover&#39;s cock was red from the blood making him hard, like a wiener sausage, she laughed madly at this idea. He didn&#39;t seem to notice as his cock entered her with practiced ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; she was surprised by her gasp of pain and pleasure.<br />
<br />
Her body reacted, her legs wrapped themselves around his torso as he started to bump and grind his hips against her. He wasn&#39;t wearing a rubber but she just didn&#39;t give a fuck anymore. She wanted something that this man could only provide her. The pumping became harder as she closed her eyes in pleasure, their bodies intertwined like they had been melted together. His ass, so rock hard, kept pumping as his face broke out in sweat. His breathing became rapid and his thrusts became erratic as she felt him about to blow his load. He let out a low groan and he pulled out. As he ejaculated his seed covered her vagina, thighs and the bed. <br />
<br />
She stood up nude. <br />
<br />
He was pulling on his clothes and boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you might stay, spend some time with me.&quot; she said in a Georgian accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got work tomorrow, early start.&quot; he grunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh okay&quot; she sounded, and Chet felt, her disappointment.<br />
<br />
The man left the room almost as quickly as if he had come.<br />
<br />
She then walked nude through the motel room to the cheap mirror and looked at her face. She could see crow&#39;s feet in the corner of her eyes, her once perky breasts were sagging. There were lines on her face and she looked very pale without makeup, like a vampire. Her eyes seemed more world weary. She wanted a baby and she was getting desperate.<br />
<br />
Chet at this stage was starting to feel something familiar about this woman, whose body he had just had sex in. It was Sarah!<br />
<br />
Some black guy had just fucked her without protection. <br />
<br />
Devastated he rang her, the call went straight to voicemail. <br />
<br />
She texted him back. &quot;What?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just fuck some black guy?&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;WTF! Are you following me Chet? I&#39;ll call the cops on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I just had a dream that a man was fucking you. I&#39;ve brought an engagement ring you fucking whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Chet&#39;s world started to fall a part he felt the pull of the jewelry he had purchased.</p>
