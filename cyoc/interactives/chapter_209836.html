<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Ringmaster heard all three options around. However, this was simply a formality, as he had already decided what to do. <br />
&quot;Very well, very well!&quot; he laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve heard all your proposals and even though they look tempting, let&#39;s allow Tony to return to human form. Jayla and Tayla will be happy to perform for our circus from now on. They do love dancing so! And you all love to see them and applaud them! Why deprive them from such a happy, fulfilled life?&quot;<br />
Everyone cheered and Jayla and Tayla glowed from the inside. Now they felt not only elated but also all fuzzy from the inside. And quite literally too. With the usual puff of smoke, Tony was restored to his human shape, convinced with false, memories that had been intelligently inserted into his mind, that he had been taken away through trickery and had watched a very elaborate animatronic take his place. Now he could go back to his place, certain to have been just a happy volunteer. As for Jayla and Tayla, they waved and bowed and went away under more cheers. Magical replicas of Jared and Tayla were created so that they could return to their own seats, pretending to be the first volunteers, also sent at the back of the tent while clever puppets took their place. These replicas would live their clones&#39; lives perfectly until in about a week, when they  would vanish in the dead of night, gone forever and leaving the circus without any trouble or suspicions. And with two new joyful recruits.   <br />
<br />
The Ringmaster after the show made Jayla&#39;s fur a little darker and Tayla&#39;s fur with white paws. Just to differentiate them better. Moreover, he created a trailer for them. A magical one. which the two ballerina bears thought they had inhabited since forever. The inside was much larger than the outside and within it, it was girly to the utmost. There was all the equipment to have the perfect tea party, a lot was pink or in soft colors and the two little beds fluffy and comfortable. There were statues and plushies of bears and ballerinas all around. It was all fluffy and fuzzy. And the two bears adored it. They got along well with the rest of the circus crew. All knew they used to be human but did not utter a word of it. After all, it was their new lives now. Those things happened. Moreover, some had been humans before. They just did not recall it. They thought they had always been imaginary creatures. Few in the circus had been truly born in their own way. The others had been transformed humans and hypnotised or forced to live in the circus. But no one spoke a word of it. Those who did had been punished thoroughly by the Ringmaster and the other warlocks and wizards. So Jayla and Tayla became star attractions, ballerinas always happy to perform, as their new loves and likings dictated. They lived to please and acted differently now. The proof was offered as the circus stayed in a larger twin.<br />
<br />
One day off, as Jayla and Tayla were practicing their moves and experimenting with accessories, like a frilly pink little parasol with bows. Then a commotion erupted amongst other performers. And a strange sight came towards them. A tiny shape bolted under their trailer and strived to hide, unaware that the two ballerina bears had spotted him already. It was a tiny man. Like a Ken doll. The same size as a doll but its proportions as that of a human male. He was panting while other performers in the distance appeared agitated. He was suddenly snatched from his hiding place from and angle that he did not expect. And he was being held by... living teddy bears dressed in pink? In what sort of freak circus had he been thrust into? The other performers had been just weird, though. <br />
&quot;Ooooh! Look, Tayla! A baby! A real little baby!&quot;<br />
&quot;She&#39;s already got a diaper!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a girl! And not a baby!&quot; grunted the shrunken male, squirming to no avail.<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ve got a diaper with little pink hearts! So you&#39;re a baby and a girl!&quot; exclaimed Tayla.<br />
&quot;Let me go!&quot;<br />
&quot;I think she is cranky. Maybe because she has had no food and kisses,&quot; said Jayla. <br />
&quot;Yes! You are right! Let&#39;s make her happy again!&quot;<br />
&quot;Help!&quot;<br />
The two bears went back into their trailer, unheeding of the squirms and insults of heir new doll and of the rest of the circus&#39; talks. For Chad the young delinquent (for that was what he was), the torture was just beginning. The two girly bears first gave him a bath, stuffed him back into the diaper he had kept in his flight for the sake of not being stark naked, forced him into a horrid frilly pink dress and put him into a high chair, all the while cooing at him. He had tried to mug a guy not even a few hours ago. How was he to know the guy was a warlock who had shrunk him to the size of a doll, but not even his clothes, and that he would take him back to the circus where he worked? All those other freaks had laughed at him and the warlock had made a diaper appear on him when he had covered his groin. He had been terrified but furious at all the mocking he had received from the now-giants around him. He had managed to escape their taunts and jeers and had thought he&#39;d found a refuge under that trailer. How wrong he was! Now he was stuck as the involuntary doll for two live teddy bears! Once in the high chair they had force-fed him baby food and washed it down with a bottle of milk. It was swallowing that humiliating food or choking on it. Or letting it smear on his face or the awful bib he was wearing and be spanked, as one bear threatened. Then, the bib had be removed and Chad burped, which he did, humiliatingly so. Then the dark brown bear had patted his bloated belly and discovered he was ticklish. A tickle torture session had ensued, complete with many coos and &#39;coochie coochie coos&#39; on the part of the two bears. Chad had been literally tickled into submission and as he lied breathless and twitching, a bonnet had been tied to his head. The light brown bear had declared that no the baby was &#39;calm&#39; it was time to make her pretty. Again thrust into the high chair, Chad&#39;s lips were slathered with a bright pink balm, bow-like barrettes put in his hair, powder put on his cheeks and even make-up plastered on his eyelids. He had cried in frustration but even that resulted in only a pacifier being set in his mouth and tied behind his head. To keep him from untying it, mittens had been attached to his hands. And booties placed on his feet to match. The teddy bears cooed at him, telling him she was the prettiest baby in the whole wide world. They set up a playpen for him, and were deciding on his future cradle when a knock had interrupted they grand plans. The Ringmaster started asking if they had seen a tiny man but stopped when he glimpsed Chad. He absolutely roared with laughter, congratulated the two bears for their great work and seized Chad so he could shown to everyone. The two bears were again given praise for their &#39;artwork&#39; and performers laughed and mocked Chad, some even tearing up in laughter. At last, the Ringmaster calmed everyone down and looked evilly at Chad.<br />
&quot;As much as this getup suits you, you bully, what shall we do with you? I have an idea but does anyone want to share theirs? Because this brainless bully deserves further punishment. So what will your fate be?&quot;      <br />
Chad gulped. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That could not be good. Would he be sentenced to something even worse than what he currently was?</p>
