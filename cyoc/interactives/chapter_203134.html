<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnny, age 28, looked in the mirror gauging his body. He was thin build with brown hair. Standing there in his khakis and button up work shirt , he decided to cast the first spell. He read in the book that a caregiver was needed. While he wanted to turn back into a baby, he&#39;d try being 3 years old and in pull-ups so he didn&#39;t need a caretaker. He chuckled at how stupid it sounded that he only needed to chant what he wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn me into a 3 year old in pull-ups.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt his body heat up a little as he started to rapidly shrink. Walking over to his computer desk he put the book on it. Johnny immediately walked back to the mirror. Looking in the mirror he saw himself turn into his late teenage years. His clothes started matching his polo shirts and khakis he wore back then. Soon he found all traces of facial hair disappear and be replaced with a boyish face as he entered puberty. His clothes were now just a t shirt and jeans. As he left puberty, his clothes turned to sweat pants and a shirt. At age 6 he saw baby fat start to grow on him.  At age 4, he felt his underwear thicken up a bit. By age 3, he was a toddler wearing thick pull-ups and his clothes were replaced with footed pajamas.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wowked&quot; he said jumping for a moment. <br />
<br />
 He was then immediately hit with a pleasurable warmth across his body. Inside his pull-ups, he found himself growing an erection.  Johnny then took a moment to inspect his body Infront of the mirror.  He finally got close to what he wanted. While he read the warning about needing a caretaker, he thought he&#39;d ignore it for a moment. He started unzipping his pajamas leaving himself in only his blue pull-up.  Looking in the mirror he was giggling at finally being a toddler. Looking down he saw a wetness indicator on his pull-up. While he used to roleplay as a baby in the house, this felt amazing. He sat on the floor staring into the mirror. He moved his hand down his crotch and felt his erection. He started rubbing the pull-up faster and faster until his body gave out in orgasm. He felt his penis jolt spewing out pee with each orgasm. <br />
 <br />
Looking in the mirror he saw the urine indicator was blue. He panted for a sec. He looked over into his closet and saw he still had his adult baby supply bag. He decided to get up and toddle over to it. Opening the bag he was shocked to see nothing but diapers size four which was for his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wut is dis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding he needed to change, he grabbed a size four diaper. Moving to middle of his bedroom he placed it on the floor.  Stepping to the side he pulled the tab off one side of his pullup. Using one hand to hold it against his crotch, he pulled the other tab off before letting go. Seeing it drop to the floor he was amazed to see his small hairless penis. He pulled at it and looked around for a sec before a cold breeze made his penis and balls shrink. Looking at the diaper on the floor, he knelt down and opened it before sitting on it. He grabbed the baby powder and started sprinkling some on his crotch. Somehow this was different than normal. Immediately without warning the smell turned him on and he saw his tiny penis become erect and point upward. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh ohh. My peepee is hawd&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed the front of the diaper with both hands and tried to push his erection down into the diaper. His previous experience as an ABDL told him he&#39;d leak if he didn&#39;t get his penis pointed down. Holding the front over his crotch, he started taping one tab on. Switching hands he moved his other hand to the grab the tape. He started uncontrollably fidgeting like he was a real toddler. Letting go of his diaper right before he could tape the other side on. Immediately he could tell he&#39;d leak.  Frustrated he untaped his diaper and tried again. Before he could get his second tab on properly, his eyes watered up and he found himself having a tantrum. Deciding this was maybe what it meant that he needed a caretaker. He decided he&#39;d just ignore the looseness for the time being and put on his diaper with his erection still going upwards. His erection being in the way made his diaper loose when he taped it on. Looking over he decided he&#39;d use his pajamas as extra protection. <br />
<br />
Getting up  Johnny then went over to his discarded pajamas. He started to put his feet in before he then fell on his butt having a tantrum kicking them off. He tried to put them on  while laying on the floor and he uncontrollably had another tantrum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t I do anything by myself? Is this why I need a caretaker&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
Looking over at his computer in the corner of the room, he toddled over and climbed into his chair. Johnny, as a 3 year old toddler, sat there on his computer looking at his next choice to fulfill his fantasies for the weekend.  As an administrator for a doctor&#39;s office, he had access to files on women he found beautiful. He could maybe still enjoy this fantasy.  Johnny took a deep breathe in anticipation while he skimmed through his files looking at multiple &quot;mothers.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Johnny put his hand on his book and tapped it while he scrolled. He found a few candidates that he could fulfill his fantasies with. Each of them were single so he&#39;d be lucky to be the center of attention.<br />
<br />
-Mary age 25. Teacher at a local high school<br />
-Amy age 21. Daycare assistant nearby<br />
-Jessica age 30. Nurse at the clinic he worked at<br />
<br />
Each candidate would be great for him considering they&#39;ve been around kids. Johnny checked then saw there was Wendy who was 27 and pregnant. Her massive boobs always caught Johnny off guard when she came in for her visits.  The last visit she was 8 or 9 months pregnant and he could see the wet spots on her shirt. Johnny groaned before rubbing the front of his new diaper. Looking at the spell book he contemplated his decision. Seeing as he needed a caretaker no matter what. He debated whether he could just turn himself into a baby for a few hours or if he should just do that after choosing a caretaker. He knew he needed to hide his spell book if he did choose a caretaker. He knew he&#39;d wish it into being a coloring book to hide it<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Johnny, the book had every intention to curse him, like everyone else it cursed, into a very messy diaper clad infant too young to walk. It was going to humiliate him every step of the way like the age vampires who wrote it intended.</p>
