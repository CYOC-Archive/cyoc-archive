<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nancy was white with fear as Tina let go her grasp of the Medallion. As then Nancy took the Medallion and tried her best to tell the powerful thing to halt the wish granting, up it only glowed even more building its powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters, nice wish!&quot; said Tina as she stepped a few feet back and away from Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made me do it! It was your wish not mine and I'm....Holy Moly!&quot; exclaimed Nancy as she saw the skin over her hands and arms toned a darker shade of tan.<br />
<br />
Tina began to laugh as she saw Nancy's skin changing color. Her laughter was short lived as in a second later she felt a difference about herself, &quot;My face!&quot; she exclaimed with surprise and some horror.<br />
<br />
Then came the voice out of nowhere, &quot;The fabric of time is now changed! The wish has effected two lives intertwinning them and thus putting a ripple in space and time. You pasts are now gone, your futures and the futures of others to come are changed or wiped away! Caution must be taken less this wish and your fates be made a permanant part of time, you are warned!&quot; said the Voice.<br />
<br />
Tina's lughter stopped as the seriousness of their mutual situation was a reality.<br />
<br />
Nancy had tears rolling down her cheeks and looked up to Tina who was changing about her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your beginning to look like that Flax colored mane and tailed seal brown mare, Tina!&quot; announced Nancy slowly.<br />
<br />
Tina tried to answer but words were not her ability as she was changing very fast to be the mare she was not long before.<br />
<br />
Moans and groans of pleasured feelings mixed as each girl changed more and more to become sisters of the same Thoroughbred breed. This time as if it were a learned pattern stored in some great mind, Tina's changed came quickly and without any note of pain.<br />
<br />
Nancy had as did Tina began to experienced a whincing amount of pain as her face grew out and changed.<br />
<br />
A soft snuffling nickker came from Tina as she was changed to her radiant mare form long before Nancy. Spralled out on the bedroom floor the girl watched in horror as clothing split and tore with the forced growth of her body.<br />
<br />
Nancy's face and head was changed as she looked the same as her horse sister Tina. The whites of her eyes shown well as the pains and mental agonies were being felt. Nancy moaned as arms changed to legs and her breasts dwindled, only to spring forth tucked high in her groin as teats and an equined udder.<br />
<br />
A strange aray of gutteral sounds came out her mouth instead of the words which poured out her mind. This too made her scared, the loss of human speach and human forms of communication. She knew all to well that physical actions and soft or coarse sounds force over layrinx were to be her voice heard by others.<br />
<br />
Nancy screamed a blood curdling groan as her vagina slipped inside her body and with the power of the Medallion was forced to reappear just below her anus and in perfect equine vulva form.<br />
<br />
Nervous she flicked her tail while still laying on the bedroom floor. Her body, legs, and sexual parts where all changed and she looked as if a natual twin to her now sister Tina.<br />
<br />
A scramble of legs and hoofs over a hard parquet floor made a hell of a racket till Nancy stood as a mare looking at Tina a mare too. From downstairs came the voice of Tina's mother calling, &quot;What's going on up there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the Voice said again, &quot;Tina Bayoun, Nancy Farnsworth, your futures are now twisted together! Together shall you do and feel the pleasures and pains of life, and those of birthing as Mares. You past history is now changed, what was is now gone and what is for you and others around you changed with it!&quot; said the Voice.<br />
<br />
Tina whinnied as the room around them began to shimmy and fade away. Then the house and garage were gone. The two mares looked about, they were at the lakeshore but standing in a large fenced pasture. Looking this way and that neither could see any of the homes built along the lake. A single white house stood back from the lake. It had a big red barn and a series of smaller farmlike buildings, but the street seperated their pasture from the house.<br />
<br />
Tina looked into Nancy's face and snuffled her wonders.<br />
<br />
On the ground between them lay the Medallion, its glow was still bright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two Mares in a pasture, a home not yet built because two people never had the daughter named Tina. The houses which her father built are not yet built because he never purchased the land from the farmer who owns the land now. You stand now as twin foals, sisters born of the Thoroughbred mare Sadie owned by the farm who own's this land. You were sired by Mason a Thoroughbred stallion owned by a farm down the road to the East. Niether of you have a human past, what was to be is now changed by your mutual wish. Do as you wished, be pleasured together by a stallion, become pregnant together, give bith together, wean and care for your foals together till each foal turns a yearling, then readied by your owner to be bred again the time shall come and together you wish to be human then human shall you become. But, be one or another of the mind to stay as horses, then both shall remain as horses as memories and learned human knowledge shall fade as mares of the flesh together you shall be, ignorant beasts born as beasts and will live the lives of beasts, together!&quot; said the Voice as the Medallion bright glow dulled and then returned to a common silvered coin.<br />
<br />
There they were two sistered mares together, as Tina tried to show Nancy the finer graces of grazing.</p>
