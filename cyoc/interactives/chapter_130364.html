<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Princess Cheshire was walking through the halls of her fathers castke, right in the center of their kingdom’s capital, the Kingdom of Formsworth. Beside her was two of her royal guards that followed her wherever she went.<br />
 <br />
   Princess Cheshire was a brown haired girl, wearing a casual red dress that she wore whenever walking within the castle.<br />
<br />
   Right now she was walking to the castle dining hall for dinner.<br />
<br />
   Her steps echoed throughout the corridor, walking with elegance, passing servants bowing as she walked by.<br />
<br />
   Upon reaching the dining hall, her two guards left her side, each of them moving to a separate corner of the dining room.<br />
<br />
   Her family, her Father the King, her mother, and her two older brothers, Damon and William, were all already seated.<br />
<br />
    Cheshire nodded to all of them, before formally sitting down on her assigned seat at the table, the one on the left side sitting beside her mother, directly facing Damon, the oldest of the siblings.<br />
<br />
       “We are all here, before we eat is there any announcements anyone would like to speak?” Chesire’s Father spoke, his voice deep and gravelly, a commanding aspect to it befitting for a King.<br />
<br />
    No one spoke.<br />
<br />
  “Very well, then let us pray to the Holy Daevons for gifting us this prosperity.”<br />
<br />
   Everyone at the table nodded again in acknowledgement. Although if one was to look at Cheshire, they would notice the slight eye roll her eyes did when the Daevons had been mentioned.<br />
<br />
        The family began speaking in a strange but elegant language. With soft flowing sounds and consonants, the royal family were speaking the human form of the divine language, praying for the Daevon’s blessing.  Cheshire never particularly cared for the Daevons although she still respected them to some degree. She simply found the idea of someone above her and her family ridiculously unfathomable. <br />
<br />
   As such, she rarely prayed to the Daevons as much as anyone else in her family did, particularly William, she only prayed when it was socially required to, anything else was out of the question.<br />
<br />
   When the praying was over, multiple servants brought in the finest gourmet food any lower class citizen could possibly imagine. Foods such as steaks, spiced soups, whole roasted pigs, and other items that would make one’s mouth water while looking at them.<br />
<br />
     The family barely spoke during the meal, only the staples at of chit chat was allowed during diner, and right afterwards, they would be given an hour of free time before heading off to bed for the night, save for the King.<br />
<br />
 When dinner was over, each of the family members went off to separate corridors from the dining hall, each off to do their own private business.<br />
<br />
  Princess Cheshire simply nodded to her Father, before walking off to the hall she had originally come from, her two royal guards, both of them of average beauty.<br />
<br />
      Cheshire walked through the halls of the castle, an uncertain and bored look on her face.<br />
<br />
     On a whim, she suddenly took a right turn, heading towards the grand castle library. <br />
<br />
    Upon entered, she was immediately bombarded with the scent of oaken wood and paper.<br />
<br />
  The library seemed to glow in a mysterious light as she entered, the blue light from the full moon Deo entering from a glassed cieling above, giving everything in the library a blue tint.<br />
<br />
  With her guards at her side, Cheshire roamed through the bookshelves of the library. Casting a lazy eye at any book that caught her attention.  Her guards said nothing, the loud footsteps from their armor slightly annoying her as they walked.<br />
<br />
         After a minute or two of searching, finding no books that fully appealed to her, Cheshire elegantly say upon a chair, giving out a sigh of boredom abs she struggled to keep her fine pose in front of the guards.<br />
<br />
      She had half a mind to spend the rest of her free time walking back to her room and go to sleep early for the night.<br />
<br />
  But then... out of the corner of her eye, she saw movement. Turning her head, for a second she could’ve sworn she saw a shadow move out of her sight, behind a bookcase.<br />
<br />
  Her curiosity peaked, Cheshire stood up, moving towards the bookshelf where she saw movement. <br />
<br />
  She inevitably found nothing, no person, no out of place shadow. Instead on the bookshelf itself, she saw an old tome,  half of its cover torn off as if it had survived a massive battle of disaster of some sort. She layed a single finger on it’s spine, immediacy you shivering as she felt a strange warmth begin to grow in her body.<br />
<br />
         She noticed both of her guards shift in posture too, most likely affected by what she had just felt.<br />
  <br />
   Panting slightly, she looked around the library, no one else other than her and her guards were here.<br />
<br />
   Picking up the heavy tome, with both hands, she brought it over to the table she was sitting at, dust flying off the time as she opened the book, something that probably hasn’t happened for years from what it looks like.<br />
<br />
       The time itself was written in an nearly unreadable language, with only the occasional snippet of the common speak. It was filled with depictions of strange circles and eldritch creatures. Although Cheshire knew that magic existed, her father having several court magicians, she herself didn’t know much about it herself, or the potential danger for an untrained person.<br />
<br />
         The heat wrapping around her body started to rapidly increase as she read from the time, the strange language becoming more and more understandable as time went on. Her guards were starting to pant as well, both of them sweating slightly as they struggled to keep their composure.<br />
<br />
   Finally, Cheshire turned the page of the book, and found a blank page, containing only a single line of text.<br />
<br />
   Almost in a trance, Princess Chesire mumbled the phrase in a language she had never spoken before “Transmutatio animae, corpus meum...”<br />
<br />
  Then the world itself began to shift around Cheshire as...</p>
