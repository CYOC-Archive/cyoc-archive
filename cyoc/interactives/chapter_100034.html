<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first place that popped into my mind was the computer lab in the library. There were some gamers who took over the room when the latest expansion to a popular game was released. Their names were Carlos, Matt, Jin, Bobby, and Greg. They were all part of an elite guild that would go for world firsts in taking down dungeon bosses. They were very skilled with computers, and equally skilled in magic. Greg, in particular, was quite powerful. His inanimate transformation magic was the real reason that they were allowed exclusive use of the entire computer lab, because anytime anyone tried to complain or tell them to leave, he&#39;d transform them into an 8&quot; action figure. I hadn&#39;t seen it myself, but rumor has it there were at least 10 different figures sitting around his PC so far, some students, some faculty. After a while, everyone just decided to leave them alone and borrow a laptop. I decided they would make excellent test subjects.<br />
<br />
I walked through the library, which seemed a little vacant. Behind the front desk, an overworked librarian was busily pouring over an old tome, his back turned to me. As he mumbled to himself about the contents of the book, I wondered if he was the only staff member who was left unchanged. Deciding it best to leave him alone, I moved on, going past the non-fiction section where I saw a dark room with computer screens as the only light source. The door was open, and I could hear the gamers chatting with each other through their headsets. Not wanting to be changed into one of Greg&#39;s dolls, I tried to see if I could make myself invisible before entering. *Snap!* And just like that, I faded away. At first it was a little disorienting, being unable to see my hands or feet, but I quickly adjusted and pressed on. Two things came to my immediate attention when I entered the computer lab: first, there were actually over 15 little nude figures sitting around Greg&#39;s computer, and second, none of these nerds had fucking showered from the moment they walked in here. It smelled awful, and I wondered if it weren&#39;t for the restrooms directly outside the lab if these smelly bastards would have shit in buckets to achieve their goals in this game.<br />
<br />
As I stood there observing the gamers and trying to decide what to do with the slobs, the last librarian stormed into the lab. &quot;MAGUS NEUTRALAS!&quot; he shouted as he clutched his old tome. Greg briefly looked up from his screen, and then went right back to his game. &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t ignore me you little shits! That was an ancient neutralization spell! Magic can&#39;t be used in this library any longer! Now GET OUT OF-&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he was immediately cut off by Greg&#39;s all too familiar spell. The librarian&#39;s entire body stiffened, and his facial expressed quickly locked into a neutral position. His skin became smooth and shiny, and the hair on his head turned into a solid plastic cap which then molded to his plastic head. He dropped his book as his hands melded into that weird open fist that action figures always have so that kids can swap out little weapons. Lastly, he began to shrink out of his clothing, until all that was left of the librarian was a pile of clothes, his glasses, his old book, and a tiny nude plastic figure.<br />
<br />
The gamers had continued to play their game during the entire transformation, and only once the spell was completed, did Greg say anything. &quot;Your turn, Jin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jin silently got up, walked across the room, and picked up the doll, &quot;It&#39;s Magus Neutral-US, dumbass.&quot; He then carried it back to Greg&#39;s desk, where he placed it in an embarrassing sexual pose next to all the other nude figures. Jin sat back down, and Greg spoke up again, &quot;Alright asshats, everyone ready for another attempt at Heroic Circe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s down this fat bitch already&quot;<br />
&quot;We better, I&#39;m tired of my toon being stuck as a pig for 10 minutes&quot;<br />
&quot;We all are. The devs were sick bastards for putting in that debuff.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright guys, pulling in 3...2...1...let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned. Some friends had told me about this dungeon boss. Based on the old Greek story, Circe was a boss monster who, rather than kill you when you hit 0 health, she would instead cast an undispellable curse on your character that left them changed into a pig for 30 minutes. She was currently the most frustrating boss in the game, because even if you defeated her, any party members who were changed wouldn&#39;t be able to move on, slowing down the entire group. So far, she was undefeated on the hardest difficulty, and I guessed correctly that this group was trying to be the first. It gave me the perfect idea for these smelly geeks.<br />
<br />
*Snap!* Nobody heard me casting my spell over their headsets. And none of them would be any the wiser of it, for now. But I knew that all I had to do was wait, and I would get my entertainment. And sure enough, about 3 minutes into the battle, I would see the effects of my spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; shouted Matt. He was the first in the party to be pigged by Circe. And unbeknownst to him, the game was about to get very real. It began with his ears. As he took off his headset and glared angrily at the computer screen, I saw them grown larger and larger until he had his very own pig ears. Next up, was his nose. His nostrils flared out as his nose grew larger and larger. Soon, he had a big ole pig snout on his face. He still hadn&#39;t noticed the changes yet, not until it spread to his hands. His fingers fused together as he typed on the keyboard, and massive nails formed his fingertips into hooves. Shocked at the sudden change, he let out a massive squeel of panic and lept from his chair!<br />
<br />
&quot;SQUEEEEEEEE! SQUEEEEEE!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
This outburst rattled his compatriots, and distracted Carlos from avoiding a massive damage spike in the game. While he gawked at Matt as his face contorted into a pigs, Carlos&#39;s character had been pigged by Circe as well. Instantly a spring-like tail popped out of the Carlos&#39;s pants as his tan skin began to turn into a pale pink. His long dark hair began falling out as pig ears pushed off his headset. And meanwhile, Matt had fallen to all fours, his clothing ripping into shreds as his body expanded. Bobby would have been next to join the two, but Greg quickly snapped the remaining trio out of their shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some fucker is messing with us guys. Stop gawking at those two morons and get back to slaying his fucking bitch of a boss! Jin, get me some heals, NOW! Bobby! Pump out as much DPS as you can! We can still beat this whore!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the trio went back to playing their game, doing their best to ignore the cries-turned-squeels of their friends. Matt was a full pig now, snorting and squealing as the shreds of his clothing lay all around him. Carlos was in the final stages of his changes, writhing on all fours as his clothes beginning to shred while his plump, pink ass expanded. It wasn&#39;t long until the two guys were indistinguishable as they snorted and oinked on the computer lab floor. Meanwhile, the remaining three gamers seemed to have things back under control, and I wondered if perhaps this was going to be the extent of my spell today, but soon enough, I heard the frustrated yell of another player. And this time, it was Bobby.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no NO! I ain&#39;t gettin&#39; turned into no pig! Fuck *snort* that *snort*! I&#39;m leav-, leav-, le-eeeeeeeeink! Oink! OINK! SQUEEEEEAAAAL!&quot; I grinned as I heard his deep bass voice turn to high, shrill squeals while his ears became as large and floppy as Carlos and Matt&#39;s. As he tried to flee the room, his feet rapidly changed into pig hooves, causing him to trip and fall forward. Now desperate to escape his fate, he pushed himself forward, crawling with his hands while his legs became shorter and shorter. Eventually, his pants got caught on his hooves, and they were dragged off of him, exposing his nice black ass, which had a little pink pig tail bobbing from it. Then, the pink of the tail spread down his body, leaving his lower torso that of a bright pink piggy, while his upper body was that of a young black college student. But soon, the changes caught up with the rest of his body, as his hands turned into hooves, spreading the pink skin all the way up to his neck. As it reached his dark hair, it all fell out, and his head became rounder to match his big pig ears. The last change was his nose, which finally stretched out into a big pig snout. He squealed out one last time, &quot;NOOOOOO-OINK! OOOOINK! SQUEEEEEEEAAAL!&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg and Jin simply continued playing. But with only their tank and healer remaining, it would be only a matter of time before Circe hit her enrage timer, a game mechanic where any boss not killed fast enough would become much, much stronger and kill everyone in the  party. Technically, it was still possible for them to win, but they would have to play perfectly, no mistakes, and no bad luck. I knew from the rumors that these guys were good enough, but I decided that I wasn&#39;t going to leave anything up to fate. So I slowly walked up to Jin&#39;s computer, and unplugged his keyboard. His eyes went wide as he realized his priest was no longer responding, and before he could give warning to his leader, Greg&#39;s warrior was defeated, and pigged. <br />
<br />
Rage is the only word I can use to describe Greg&#39;s reaction to his impending fate. He slammed his keyboard, pushed his monitor to the ground, and sent all his action figures flying. &quot;FUCK! FUCK! WHOEVER DID THIS IS GOI-NK-G TO PAY! DO YOU HEAR ME! I&#39;M GO-INK TO TURN YOU INTO A SEX DOLL AND FU-OINK YOU EVE-REEEEEEEEEE DAY! NO-INK-BODEEEEEE FU-OINKS WITH GREEEEEEEEE-G *SNORT* NOBOD-EEEEEEE! SQUEEEEEEEAL! SQUEEEEEEEEEL! SQUEEEEEEEL!&quot;<br />
<br />
And while Greg thrashed about, hitting and throwing whatever he could as his hands turned to hooves, Jin simply accepted his fate. As his priest got slammed by the boss, he stood up, carefully removed all his clothing, and placed it on his desk next to his computer. As he felt his feet begin to change into hooves, he voluntarily got down to his hands and knees, and let the changes come. He never said a word as his ears grew out, his nose pushed into a snout, and the pink coloring spread, erasing his tan Asian skin. At first I thought he must have been pretty zen to just accept something like this, but then I saw how hard his dick was. Ah. This clearly wasn&#39;t his first time as a pig, nor did I think it would be his last.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Greg continued to rage and thrash about, now on the floor given his tiny pig arms and legs. He tried to grab the leg of a chair to throw, but his hands could no longer grip them, and before his very eyes (and snout), they turned into hooves. He grunted and squealed in rage, knocking over the chair with his hooves since he could no longer grab it. And as he thrashed about, he suddenly caught sight of his own cock, shrinking down and twisting into a creepy pig cock.  He let out a squeel of horror, as his face pushed out to meet his pig nose while the remainder of his dark brown hair fell out. It wasn&#39;t long before he was just another pig in a crowded computer lab turned barn.<br />
<br />
I smirked as I scanned the room, admiring my work. Matt, Carlos and Bobby were indistinguishable from one another, simply laying about in the room. Greg was obviously the one surrounded by all the broken computer parts, and Jin...well...he was the one who had a big puddle of white goo underneath him, looking as mellow as a pig can look. The effects were only temporary, of course. Part of my spell was that once the in-game curse wore off in 30 minutes, they would return to normal, just like their characters. Well...except for Greg, who, in his fit of rage, broke his computer and logged himself out of the game. Someone would have to log in for him to end the spell. Hope he has an easy to guess password, I thought smugly to myself.</p>
