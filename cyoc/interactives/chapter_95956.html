<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The year is 203X, the world has changed for the better, advancements in science and technology has brought on a new golden age on earth, almost every building and house is run by solar energy, almost everyone drives electric cars, new and improved filters bring fresh clean water to everyone. Roughly 32% of the population still uses gas powered vehicles, and it is estimated that in the next few years everybody will be energy efficient.<br />
<br />
Jake McStewart, a young student in Oxford University would change the world forever, he would take a leading role in advancing nanoscience and nanotechnology several decades ahead, working with DNA and nanobots, he soon made little machines that can repair cells better than anything else could, cuts and bruises gone in a matter of seconds, the world was astonished by his creation, it was like something completely out of science fiction but here it is, and it works beautifully.<br />
<br />
When asked what was driving Jake he said that he just likes helping people, that wasn&#39;t the case though, Jake&#39;s actual drive was a bit stranger, and perverse. Jake is a furry, and a transformation enthusiast, at young he was always fascinated by animals and wondered how it would feel like to be one, but it didn&#39;t stop there, he wondered what it would be like to be female, younger, older, all of these things is what drove him to be a scientist, this was going to be his gift to the furry fandom, no more fantasies, truth be told he made the tissue repair bots by accident, but figured than letting his discovery go to waste, he showed it off and became famous, and now with all this money and resources he was dead set on making it possible to change yourself.<br />
<br />
And one day he got, he spent many weeks working on this nonstop, staying up for days, and his sacrificed finally paid off, he injected the nanomachines into his bloodstream, he was so excited he didn&#39;t even feel it, he started punching in the commands for his little robots to do, his mind told him to take it slow and do minor changes at a time, but he was too excited and horny to listen to his rational mind, he typed anthro red fox, herm, and pressed enter, the changes started immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels... soooo... goood&quot; Jake said gasping at how good it felt<br />
<br />
He felt little tickles as fur came out of his skin, covering his entire body in the beautiful coat of a red fox, his feet started to change, ripping his shoes and socks as they became digitigrade, pads forming on the bottom, he then felt his pants getting tighter as his ass started swelling and his hips expanding, than a loud ripping noise was heard as his long bushy tail ripped through his pants, his penis grew several inches longer as it ripped through the front, it turned red and the head became pointier, a knot formed at the base and a sheath soon followed, his balls grew bigger too, he reached down and started masturbating furiously, he felt something leaking down his legs, with his free hand he investigated and found a wet and sensitive vagina that wasn&#39;t there a second ago, he sticked his fingers in there and almost fell over at how good it felt, his chest started to tingle, he smiled as he knew what would happen next, he quickly lied down on the ground so he wouldn&#39;t fall over from the intense pleasure he was feeling all over his new body, his nipples became erect as his chest started expanding, his shirt was being stretched to the limit and soon ripped, reveling his new C cup breasts to the world, he took his soaking wet hand out of his pussy and started to touch and message his new breasts, his arms and hands changed to more feminine looking ones, his gasps and moans started to get higher pitched as his adams apple dissapeared, her face started to change as her muzzle pushed out, her nose turned black and reformed and she grew whiskers, her ears migrated to the top of her head and became triangles, lastly her brown hair started growing longer till it passed a little over her shoulders.<br />
The transformation was complete and Jake was feeling her orgasm coming, she closed her eyes and braced for it, cum squirted everywhere, on her tattered clothes, her lab equipment, and some even got in her mouth, she swallowed it. <br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s what my cum taste like&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
She slowly got up and looked in a mirror, yep, she was an anthro fox with a nice cock, she looked at her tattered, cum covered clothes and thought about getting some new clothes that would show off her new assets, then the clothes started to change, her ripped up shirt started sowing itself back together, and changing colors, from white to pink, the new shirt showed her belly and hung tightly to her tits, there was no bra underneath so her erect nipples were easily seen, yellow words started to appear on her shirt that spelled &quot;YIFF&quot;, then came her pants and underwear, they also started to sow themselves back together, her pants changed from khakis to blue jeans and her underwear changed to a black thong, the new pants where pleasantly tight on her and they perfectly showed off her perfect ass and hips as well, and her package on the front, there was no hole for her tail so the pants hanged down a bit, exposing her thong, red words started to appear on her back pockets that red &quot;FOX HOLE&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at her new clothes and giggled &quot;I guess the nanomachines got into my sperm&quot; she said to herself, &quot;Now that I have new clothes, I should get a new name&quot;, she thought to herself for a moment then decided on a name &quot;Jennifer! oh yes, I like it&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer then looked at her lab equipment that still had cum on it, she got an idea, she thought about having that test tube turn into a dildo, and it did.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome! I can change anything that I cum on!&quot; She got excited thinking of everything she could do with her nanomachines induced sperm.</p>
