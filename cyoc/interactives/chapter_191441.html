<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley &quot;Ash&quot; Bernhardt didn&#39;t know what was going on by the time the two buff people ran out and grabbed the containers from the truck he&#39;d been casing. Ash didn&#39;t exactly steal for the sake of pleasure. He was dirt poor, and he did what he was good at. And it turned out that was stealing. The dirty blond haired thief had amber colored eyes, a slight build that gave him no confidence in trying to take on those two freaking tanks who ran off with whatever that was in the back. He was dressed in a light brown hoodie, a black long sleeved shirt underneath, black jeans, and some pretty nice boots he nicked from a past job.<br />
<br />
After that, Ash didn&#39;t feel so good about going for whatever was in the front. Chances are there would be some kind of alarm - loud or quiet - going off. And he was not about to get sent away to the slammer.<br />
<br />
Ashley was slim and while somewhat handsome, his rogueish good looks were the sort that might get interpreted badly in the slammer. And he was not in a hurry to have that added to his list of life experiences. For now he decided to change targets. Those two buff people seemed to have the same idea he had, so he figured they might have some spoils he might be able to get his hands on. He&#39;d just need to follow - and then wait. Biting his lip, Ash also found himself worrying about the possibility of fighting a pair of freaking muscle freaks.<br />
<br />
There was a chance there were more of them in there after those two left. And all Ashley had in terms of weapons were...<br />
<br />
A tiny switchblade that Ash was pretty sure was dull at the edge and only good hypothetically for trying to freak someone out.<br />
A couple of his implements, made more for getting into locks and cutting windows than for fighting.<br />
A singular bag for use in grabbing up his spoils.<br />
And an empty prop gun just in case he needed to make a desperation move. Nobody who knew guns would assume this thing was anything close to real.<br />
<br />
He followed them, keeping behind trees, smoking areas on local business centers, bushes and bus stops. Not sure if he was noticed or not. The people were heading toward a more residential spot in town. Ash gulped - he was really playing with fire on this one. He got the feeling that he was getting involved in something he really had no business being involved with. Sweat pooled at his brow. He cleared it and kept moving - can&#39;t let them get away!<br />
<br />
&quot;No honor among thieves, eh Ashley?&quot; The boyish thief almost heard his mother talking. For all the nineteen years he was alive, that <i>bitch</i> spent most of them high and trying to chase the next high. It didn&#39;t matter what she needed to fry her brain on. Just that she did so. Maybe they were just so dirt poor she didn&#39;t want to be coherent for it. Thieving was almost certainly a better job than what his mom did for a living.<br />
<br />
The car was starting to slow, and pull in toward a remarkably normal residential. Ashley watched from behind a tree, a street away, as the two buff thieves got out and took their cargo with them. Which looked like a huge amount of some...some kind of drink? What the fuck was this racket? Ashley had heard of drug dealing, and he had heard of running contraband, but this was the first time the young thief ever heard of <i>supplement dealing</i>. He was pretty sure that was something the folks at that gym were using. What was going on here?<br />
<br />
...Was there something going down with that stuff?<br />
<br />
Ashley crept closer, suppressing a nervous shake in his left arm. Don&#39;t get caught, don&#39;t get caught. Thankfully there were not many people out on the street now. Most were either at work or heading to work outside this area. Ashley gulped when he was just a house away - he heard something. The car was starting. He froze in place - and <i>waited</i>. Ashley pondered what the hell these people were trying to sell. This stuff couldn&#39;t be lucrative. There had to be more going on here. He needed to get in there.<br />
<br />
The car drove off, quickly, not even checking or anything. Ashley wiped his forehead as he assumed they were gone now and the house was gonna be far less defended. He first and foremost rushed around, checking the doors, windows, and looking to see if anyone else was home. A few lights were on to give the impression, but otherwise there was nobody home at this rate. A smile crept over Ash&#39;s face. The thief felt confident now. He went to check the back door and---yes.<br />
<br />
Yes!!<br />
<br />
The backdoor to the house, as some idiots left it, was left unlocked. The young man breathed, thinking about how long he had. If these people went to work now, they probably would come back either at the start of dusk or later in the night. Knowing the musclehead type, they were probably the type to indulge a bit. He could really inspect the place! Ashley entered the house, and started looking around, checking the standard storage spots.<br />
<br />
His mind however was drawn by curiosity and the mystery of it to those drinks. He knew he should look for some money, any party drugs, the kinds of stuff he knew would get him a profit. But every time he thought to go upstairs, his curiosity beckoned him onward. Ashley shook his head and decided - just a check in. He walked uneasily through the living room and, when he saw the container full of the drinks, he tilted his head. Yeah, from what he saw from his casing of the truck, this was just the supplement that big German and African American brought in with that...that hottie.<br />
<br />
If he wasn&#39;t so bent on stealing from her that time, Ashley almost felt like giving it a try. He hadn&#39;t had sex in so fucking long. Last time he remembered was his last girlfriend from outta town. Ashley contemplated aloud, &quot;Soon as this job is done, I&#39;m gonna <i>fuck</i>. I&#39;m gonna fuck so hard. I&#39;m gonna get some woman to give me a blowjob, and then I&#39;m gonna fuck...&quot; A dumb, licentious grin spread across Ashley&#39;s face. Hopefully they wouldn&#39;t laugh him out for his admittedly rather girly name.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Ash went ahead and started inspecting the drinks. There were no identifying nutrient bars or anything. Nothing to indicate what went into this stuff. No indications of any proper testing or certification. Was...was there some kinda drug in these things? As Ashley held one of them aloft, he thought about what he might be able to do with this. He could sell it to some of his street friends. See if they got a kick out of it...or, or, he could...<br />
<br />
Ashley didn&#39;t like the idea of doing as his mother did. Of trying some drug he barely knew anything about. But considering the facts available to him? This was a freaking supplement. Whatever edgy stuff they put in there, it&#39;d probably just get him hyped and moving faster or something. No reason to think it would do anything untoward. No reason to think it would be anything like what his mom got up to. Gulping, Ashley commenced opening the dosage container with uneasy, sweating hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ashley stated, chuckling to himself, &quot;Down the hatch!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Ashley downed the drink. Nigh on immediately, the thief felt a sudden heat rushing over his body! &quot;Aww, shit, what the hell kinda pre-workout drug is this...?&quot; He wavered on his feet, trying to keep his balance...and when he raised his hand to look at it, he noticed something. And raised his other hand too. His hands...and his forearms...they were looking bigger. &quot;What the shit...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley gasped in pain as his arms suddenly cramped up, almost falling on the floor straightaway. His biceps and triceps suddenly surging with growth, Ashley groaned, &quot;This cannot be real...aww fuck...&quot; He watched as his arms grew larger, stronger, shredding the sleeves of his shirt and even his hoodie and pushing the lower sleeve off. He flexed his biceps, wincing from the pain as they still pumped, pulsed, and grew - triceps keeping up ardently. &quot;This is so fucking weird...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof!!&quot; The feeling of his shoulders bunching up and then almost exploding outward, eviscerating the upper sleeves of his shirt and hoodie, starting to press his hood down, left Ashley gasping. He gulped, feeling his back broaden and his lats - he never, ever had lats! - pushing out, cutting and ripping right through his clothes due to the sheer width and breadth of his back. Muscles he never knew he even had gained prominence in the process - growing larger...taller...!<br />
<br />
The feeling of his spine creaking and growing was sickening, but then he felt something more pleasant to go with the pain.<br />
<br />
His chest grew outward slowly, nipples pressing against what remained of his shirt and hoodie, Ashley letting out only a few scant pitiful noises as he moaned - his physique was just...turning so fucking out there. He had never worked out a day in his life, and here he was looking slightly bigger than those meatheads who stole this stuff! &quot;Fuck!!&quot; Ashley said as he wavered on his feet. He knew what was probably coming next.<br />
<br />
The feeling of his abs tightening, growing out in an almost shell-like form on his midsection was enough to momentarily knock the air out of Ash&#39;s diaphragm. He needed to breathe - and his awareness of what was going on only returned when he felt his butt growing bigger. &quot;I...heh...I like...I like big booties...and I cannot lieeaaaaaaaaagh!!&quot; The sudden pleasure and pain got him at once - pleasure from his ass feeling just so good, and pain from his groin suddenly feeling tight - too tight - against his pants!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!! Fuck, my fucking dick is getting smashed!&quot; Ashley groaned, realizing his voice sounded slightly deeper. With his wrathful, larger hands, he pulled his jeans to pieces and stood there in a pair of highly strained boxer shorts. Almost painted on at this rate, showing a manhood that was slowly growing larger - and not even from just his erection! &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s giving me a bigger dick too...ohh, this is a miracle drug. I&#39;m not sharing <i>this</i>!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley decided then and there - these idiotic muscleheads from this house grabbed this stuff, brought it over, and now they just left the backdoor unlocked? They might as well have given all this stuff to him. Because Ashley intended to keep the pleasure train rolling along. No sense stopping now---&quot;ooh fuck,&quot; Ashley shook his head. His legs were growing bigger - and without the jeans constricting him it felt so much better.<br />
<br />
He watched his quads and thighs fight for room, thickening to the point he swore they were as thick as some tree trunk. He definitely had legs as a strong point, eh? Ashley chuckled somewhat dumbly, &quot;I got thick legs...&quot; He was almost delirious from pleasure. It wasn&#39;t a question of if he came, it was a question of when. As his calves grew into diamond shaped hardened muscles, and his feet grew larger to match his larger countenance, Ashley Bernhardt figured the change was done.<br />
<br />
He numbly went to try and fish his cock out...but the very moment it touched his hand, the game was over.<br />
<br />
Ashley almost screamed from pleasure and started shooting off. One emission! Fuck! Two! Ohh it felt so good. Three!? Fuck this stuff had him cumming a lot. One smaller load later and Ashley found himself almost knocked off his feet. He wondered if there was some way to manage how good it felt. Fuck, maybe it was just because he was so on edge. Ashley looked in a window nearby and preened unapologetically - his face like most of him now looked just a deal more rugged, stronger in countenance...though, he did note it seemed he lacked the bit of stubble he usually had.<br />
<br />
And his muscles were unobscured by body hair. Well, he saw no reason to think badly of it. This just made his body look even better! &quot;Now...what am I gonna do,&quot; he said with a coy smirk at the bottles left there full of what he now considered liquid pleasure, &quot;With you?&quot;</p>
