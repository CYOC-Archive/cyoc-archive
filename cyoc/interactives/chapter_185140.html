<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two days later, Nick couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. His video had more views than it ever had when he tried with Luke. When he saw that, he decided to do more. He was so happy that he forgot all about his jealousy and wanted nothing more than sharing the news with his best friend. To celebrate, they ordered pizza. Nick took the double of what he usually did. The stress surely did a trick on his appetite.<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, Nick and Luke had been doing a video everyday since the breakthrough. It wasn&#39;t always the both of them, since Luke was still quite busy with his workout and friends, but it didn&#39;t matter. In fact, the videos where Nick was alone did alot better than the ones in duo. <br />
When he didnt record or plan new videos, Nick liked to read comments, while eating chips or whatever. He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. Everything he saw was always nice or positive feedback. He&#39;s never seen that in any community. There was just one, from someone new to the channel, that bugged him. <br />
&quot;I quite like the chubby one, he&#39;s so funny ! Too bad the other one isn&#39;t as interesting...&quot;<br />
Was he supposed to be the chubby one ? Of course he was, considering Luke&#39;s body. It was supposed to be nice anyway... Nick dismissed it, blaming his forming double chin that was here since a long time anyway. Its not like they saw his body, only his face. He always had a rounder face, so the confusion was just normal. What wasn&#39;t normal was the roundness forming in his shirt, but it wasn&#39;t yet the time for him to realize that.<br />
<br />
Two monthes later, it was time to celebrate the 100th video on the channel. Nick and Luke had decided to do a video fully IRL, answering questions that had been sent by their viewers on Twitter. If it wasn&#39;t already clear, now the guys were both sure of it, Nick was the favorite. When the questions weren&#39;t about new projects, the videos, or the duo, they were exclusively centered around Nick. He spent a good amount of time reajusting his shirt. He didn&#39;t get it, everything he wore seemed small these days.<br />
After the recording, he proceded in editing the video. It was the first time since the beginning that they did a video with their full body. Watching it, Nick fully realized what had caused his outfits problems : the round mass jiggling everytime he moved, that hadn&#39;t been there three monthes prior. He then ran (as well as he could) to the bathroom to investigate the damages.<br />
He hadn&#39;t been dreaming. In front of him was an overweight guy with a chubby gut and a fat rear. He decided to weight himself and felt a little sick to his new bigger stomach when he realized he needed to bend a bit to see the numbers. 190 pounds. That was 35 more than what he thought. He had gained 35 pounds since he started recording his videos, with a grand total of 50 pounds since he started college. Why hadn&#39;t Luke told him anything ?! What will he do now, he could never be able to lose all this weight, he couldn&#39;t get rid of 15 pounds, so 50 was out of the equation.<br />
Nick took his shirt off, with some difficulty, to discover the pale dome of flesh that was his body now. He touched it and let his hand sink into the flab. On his side were two love handles that hadn&#39;t appeared yet before. His chest had become what could now be called moobs, even if small ones. But what hurt him the most, the most delicate subject, was his face once again. He thought he had a double chin back then, but it was nothing next to the round face he now sported. How could he not have seen anything ? Should he seek help from his friend to lose the weight ?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Luke was doing his daily sport routine, when some people came to talk to him. He was used to it now. They wanted to know if he was Nick&#39;s friend. At first it didn&#39;t bother him, Nick was the one doing most of the work, it was normal that he would get the most out of it, but Luke still hoped he would get some kind of recognition. <br />
But it never happened. He didn&#39;t get it. It wasn&#39;t like Nick was so much funnier than him. And, to be fair, he wasn&#39;t quite as handsome as Luke. He was even getting pretty tubby these days. But one thing was sure, whatever he was doing, it was working. Maybe Luke could ask Nick for some advices.</p>
