<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If you&#39;re going to be honest, Davy would not have been your type when you were human. Brianna had a thing for men and women who were tall, quiet, and modest, not short, overbuilt little sacks of high energy who ran around fully in the nude. But you aren&#39;t really Brianna anymore - it seems bizarre to even consider sexual preferences, really, when the concept of physical existence in flesh and bone is one that drives you for a bit of a loop now. It&#39;s all just smashing together lumps of tissue when you get right down to brass tacks, isn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
Now you can see beyond the merely physical elements of such relationships. The emotions, the feelings, those seem far easier to navigate, in a near-total reversal of what used to be your love life. It suddenly seems insane that two fully-grown creatures could ever have anything but love for each other. Love made the world better - love fed the soul, love provided nourishment for the core of one&#39;s existence. You can&#39;t imagine holding any stronger feeling for any living creature, even this little green man staring lustfully up at you. <br />
<br />
So after a moment, you kneel down with a smile, a warm, genuine expression that&#39;s only accentuated by the ethereal beauty if your human guise. &quot;Yes, Davy,&quot; you reply, your tone sweet as you reach out a hand to caress his face. &quot;I will marry you.&quot; It sounds batshit for a second, but you quickly find it to be totally sensible. Why wouldn&#39;t you marry him? Why wouldn&#39;t you declare your love for this creature? Compared to your immortal existence, his life will be but a flash in the pan - why wouldn&#39;t you want to make that an adoring flash.<br />
<br />
You briefly spot a red string snaking out from his heart and towards that of your human form, but he&#39;s quickly throwing his arms around you, dragging you into a kiss. You return it, suddenly finding that the whole concept of kissing is a strange one - all the other times you kissed someone as Brianna seem like surreal dreams. His tongue pokes into your mouth, and you find yourself clumsily trying to repeat the action with his own lips - but your awkwardness seems not to bother the little creature. When he pulls back, his eyes are still full of desire, but there&#39;s something more affectionate mixed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take such good care of you, I promise!&quot; he shouts with glee, taking off the diamond necklace and putting it around your neck. &quot;I&#39;ll support you and love you and take care of all your needs! Come on, there&#39;s a chapel where we can get married just down the street!&quot; He&#39;s all too eager to lead you out of here, and you&#39;re all too eager to leave. You take one last look at Jem as the excited little man pulls you towards an exist, finding her smiling despite one raised eyebrow. It doesn&#39;t seem to be what she expected, but you feel fairly certain that this will still get the job done as far as her training is concerned.<br />
<br />
Davy talks your ear off as you head down to the chapel, explaining his past, how he was a highly successful sales executive before a pack of goblins had made him like them, hoping to utilize his business acumen. Instead, his mind had remained sharp as a whistle and unafflicted by any forced loyalty, allowing him to remain free - and as it turned out, goblins could still make for exceedingly skilled salesmen. You try to relate your own history, but the history of <i>you</i> is rather limited, only going back to your creation at Jem&#39;s hands - and talking about Brianna&#39;s history, her time in the Navy and struggling to find a job, feels like describing something you read about ten years ago and can only barely recall.<br />
<br />
It should be offputting, you&#39;re certain of that, but Davy doesn&#39;t seem to mind. He takes things fast, like any goblin does, but there&#39;s a compassion paired with that impatience. He&#39;s a creature who&#39;s had decades robbed from him, but he still approaches the world with a kind heart, abandoning any pretense that might get in the way of his personal success and of making others happy. By the time you&#39;re at the altar, exchanging vows, any lingering concern over making a bad choice has fully disappeared. Neither of you can afford regrets - you, because you&#39;ll have eternity for them to kill you, and him, because his life is passing by too quickly to be stuck in the past.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s something adorable about getting into his car, and seeing the custom-made goblin-sized seat that allows him to still drive around town with ease. Life finds a way, as you think Brianna once heard in a movie; he&#39;s adapted, found ways to accomodate his altered physical state, kept his spirit up in the face of forces that could&#39;ve torn his life asunder. You almost wonder if Jem sent this little man up to you specifically to remind you of the best that mortals have to offer - but it&#39;s hard to think about anything else once you arrive at his home, get out of his car, and immediately lift the goblin up for a much more passionate bit of making out.<br />
<br />
You carry him right into the bedroom, throwing the short man down onto the bed before easily removing the outer layer of your avatar&#39;s clothing. His little rod is at its full length, throbbing and pulsing, and you instinctively crawl over to place your lips around it. It&#39;s small, yes, but his virility is hardly in question, as you soon have wave after wave of goblin spunk traveling down your throat. By the time you lift your mouth away from your new husband&#39;s member, a bit of the sticky white gloop is dangling from the corner of your mouth; your tongue licks it up as your eyes invite him to truly consummate this marriage.<br />
<br />
The flame that burns half as long burns twice as bright - and as Davy leaps on you, the raging strength of that fire is nearly overwhelming. His muscular little arms rip away your last vestiges of clothing, leaving you naked as his face buries itself within your ample bosom, tongue working wonders over the tender flesh. You guide his little shaft to your folds, moaning with delight as he enters your avatar. The small size is hardly an obstacle - this is a man who understands the female body and its needs. His movements are deliberate, expertly-executed, and in record time he&#39;s found that most important of spots. Words aren&#39;t needed for you to know that he puts your pleasure first - he wasn&#39;t lying when he said he would meet your needs.<br />
<br />
Your legs wrap around the goblin as he rams you over and over, a red-hot rocket crashing into the most sensitive regions of your body with sensual expertise. Over and over, your bodies rock together in orgasm - he never once goes there himself without bringing you there first. The longer he ravishes you, the more and more you feel yourself reconnecting to this physical world, drawn back down to mortal pleasures and affections. It seems like hours pass before he&#39;s finally too exhausted to continue, pulling out a member covered in both your fluids - but he still finds the energy to crawl over and give you a sweet, gentle kiss before he collapses on his side of the bed, more or less completely passed out.<br />
<br />
While you&#39;re not quite as tired yet, it&#39;s not far off. Davy has given your human guise a thorough workout, pushing it to the brink of what it can endure. Glancing over at your husband, you silently reaffirm to yourself that you don&#39;t regret this, smiling as you see the red string between you is thicker than ever. At the back of your mind, you know that this creature will be gone in a relative blink of the eye, til-death-do-you-part racing towards you already... and you can live with that. Because for that blink, you&#39;ll have loved him, and he&#39;ll have loved you.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s enough.</p>
