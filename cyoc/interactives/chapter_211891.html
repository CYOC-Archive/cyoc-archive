<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I left my bedroom and walked down the hall to see that my apartment had changed. My living room was doubled in size, it had a second hallway on the other side, there were more pairs of shoes by the door, and as I walked by my spare bedroom it looked far more used than it had been. The furniture in my living room looked far more expensive and there was a new fireplace in the back, with a painting of my face above the mantle. I heard someone in the kitchen and went to investigate.<br />
Inside the kitchen I saw my neighbor, Kevin Taylor, standing at my sink, cleaning dishes and wearing an apron that read ‘Jason’s Favorite Chef’ on it. He was a college professor at the school I went to, and was therefore a bit older than me, but he was a short guy, no taller than 5’4”, and thin. He had thick red hair on his head, and he had tried growing facial hair, but it was pretty wispy, but the Kevin in front of me had a full beard. I knew for sure that he was straight before all of this, and considering he clearly hadn’t bulked at all, I was confident in knowing this.<br />
I cleared my throat, and Kevin turned to me with a smile. “Oh, Jason! Were you getting hungry for dinner?” <br />
“Yeah, actually, I’m starving.” <br />
“Should I make us something then?” He looked at me doe-eyed, as if he genuinely didn’t know if he should make dinner or not. I thought for a second and replied: “You can make me something, but I think you’ll have some of my cum for dinner.” I waited nervously for a response, and I felt myself get hard at the thought of Kevin sucking me off for his dinner.<br />
Kevin simply smiled. “Sure, and what should I make the rest of you?”<br />
“Steaks and broccoli are fine. Oh, and you’re going to have dinner now before you cook everything else.”<br />
As soon as ai said that, Kevin kneeler down and began undoing the knot on my shorts, pulling them down and exposing my lengthening (and newly longer) cock. He began licking the bottom of my cock, bringing it to full mast before placing his mouth around the tip, wrapping his hands around the base of it and beginning to pump, practically giving me both a blowjob and a handjob (which considering the length, it was kind of necessary), and I had to admit that both felt wonderful. I moaned loudly in appreciation.<br />
After a few minutes, I began cumming into his mouth, and I looked down to see him happily swallowing every drop. As I calmed down and he lapped up the final drops, he brought my shorts back up and tied them tight before standing up. “Thank you for dinner.” He said before turning to start preparing the steaks.<br />
“Oh before you go, you wanted me to remind you that Mark and Ash will be getting home from work soon.” I knew I couldn’t ask who they were, it’d make things weird, but I didn’t recognize the names. “Gotcha, thanks.” I left the kitchen to explore the rest of my expanded apartment.<br />
I returned to the spare bedroom, which had two names hanging from the door: ‘Kevin’ and ‘Carter’. Inside was a single king-sized bed, and the room was decorated with a mix of nerdy posters (likely belonging to Kevin) and football memorabilia and trophies that must have belonged to Carter. I looked at one of the trophies and saw the name ‘Carter Davis’, a famous football player! I had THE Carter Davis in my weird man family thing, I couldn’t believe it! <br />
I walked over to the other hallway on the opposite side of the living room. The side room on this side had three names on it: ‘Mark’, ‘Ash’, and ‘Connor’, though Connor’s was scraped onto the door, not engraved like the rest. It looked recent too, so Connor must have been a recent addition to the family. Inside was a variety of different things that must belong to the three men and a set of three-tall bunk beds against the wall, they appeared to be full-sized beds too. <br />
The other door in the hallway there, besides the bathroom, led to a home gym, and inside I found two men. First I spotted Carter, my athlete crush, lifting weights on the bench press. He was a 6’8”, muscular half-black man, short black hair with a goatee, his body hidden inside a set of oversized black sweats. Standing above him, spotting him, was a tall young man with piercing blue eyes, with curly brown hair covering his forehead, and a strong jawline. He wore a pair of also-oversized red sweats, making it hard discern what was underneath.<br />
As Carter finished his set and put the weight on the hook, he sat up to look at me. “Hey man, what’s up?” He asked me.<br />
“Take your shirts off, you’re probably hot.” As soon as I said that, both of them took off their sweatshirts, revealing muscular torsos. I had seen Carter’s body before,but damn, he was muscular. Thick balloons for pecs, arms that bulged in anll the right places and a beer belly he was proud of. He had some new tattoos, including my name “Jason” written right above his heart. The other guy, who I assumed was Connor, had a hairy chest, though the hair was matted to a defined muscular chest from the sweat. The hair got sparse as it went downwards, making a beautiful treasure trail between his abs. There were rods in his nipples, which I found kinda hot. He was powerfully built too - and probably a little bigger than me, actually. I couldn’t help but be jealous.<br />
Both guys covered their torsos with their arms, as if they were embarrassed by me seeing them shirtless. “Don’t worry, you can be shirtless in here, I’m okay with it.” They slowly lower their arms back to their sides.<br />
“Um, Mr. Gray, sir?” Connor spoke up.<br />
“You can call me Jason, Connor.”<br />
“Okay, um, Jason, I just wanted to thank you again for taking me in last week. I didn’t know where I was gonna go after I turned eighteen but I really like it here.” He blushed.<br />
“My pleasure, Connor. Plus, now Carter gets a workout buddy. Speaking of…” I decided to be a bit devious again. “Now that there are two of you, you can try a new workout thing. If you make out for a few seconds right after a set, it’ll help you with the gains. Go ahead, try it on the next set, I guarantee you’ll feel it.”<br />
With excitement, Carter laid back down and did another set of bench presses while Conner spotted him. As soon as he was done, Conner walked around, leaned down and pressed his lips on Carters. The two of them kissed for a few seconds, passionately, before Connor pulled back, and Carter sat up. He flexed for a second and smiled.<br />
“Aw yeah, I can feel it! Thanks man!” I watched the two of them work out for a bit, making out between reps, before deciding to leave to wait for the two men that would arrive soon. I told them dinner would be ready soon, so finish up and they thanked me before I left.</p>
