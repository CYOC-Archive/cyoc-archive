<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff found himself in his homeroom before any of his fellow classmates had finished mulling about the hallways--and was likely to be sitting there for the next 20 minutes before homeroom began. As such, Jeff sighed as he watched Mr. Song prepare his white board with a brain teaser he was known to start each History class with as a way to get the class to calm down and focus after being in the hallway--and for those who got the brain teaser correct the extra credit point or two that was awarded, was sure to incentivize everyone to make an attempt.<br />
<br />
Problem is, Mr. Song liked picking extremely difficult brain teasers--almost as a way of torturing his students with the promise of extra credit that very few if any could possibly earn. He was an especially old teacher who might have in a normal-sized school district have been forced to retire by this point, especially after that second hearing aid he&#39;d added. Jeff wondered briefly what Mr. Song might have been like as a younger boy, before deciding that it might just be prudent to find out. After all, Mr. Song hadn&#39;t many years left for himself. The old man was slightly stooped, had a full head of white hair, noticeable bifocals, a cardigan--despite how warm it was outside--over his shirt, tie, and slacks. His shoes were loafers.<br />
<br />
Jeff slipped out his phone and opened the app and scanned Mr. Song.<br />
<br />
Name: Arthur Song<br />
Age: 68<br />
Mental age: 68<br />
Height: 5&#39;11&quot;<br />
Weight: 181 lbs<br />
Build: Thin<br />
Gender: Male<br />
<br />
Jeff decided that returning Mr. Song to Kindergarten might be the perfect thing--make him young enough to &quot;start over&quot; and maybe... hmm... maybe he could be the solution to Tommy&#39;s need for more responsibility? He&#39;d have to make it so that the new Arthur would have reason to interact with Tommy frequently. Well, what if Arthur was Jeff and Tommy&#39;s other adopted little brother? That might work.<br />
<br />
When Jeff was done he smiled at his work.<br />
<br />
Name: Artie Song Davis<br />
Age: 5<br />
Mental age: 5<br />
--Memory:<br />
----Relationships: Tommy Davis (adopted brother), Jeff Davis (adopted brother) Davis Family (adopted)<br />
Height: 3&#39;4&quot;<br />
Weight: 42 lbs<br />
Build: Thin<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Alter reality to fit? Yes<br />
Alter clothes to fit? Yes<br />
<br />
Worried that someone else might walk in before the transformation had finished, Jeff pressed enter, and sat back to watch as Mr. Song was about to transform into yet another younger brother.<br />
<br />
The first thing Jeff noticed as Mr. Song aged back through his 60s was his posture shifted. It soon became obvious that a certain bit of mobility was returning to the old man by how he stretched--his back popping a little as his spine moved back into a better alignment that had Mr. Song standing to his full height. As he re-entered his 50s, his hearing aids disappeared, white hair began darkening to gray, and then streaks of dark brown began to appear. Hands which had shook a little holding the dry erase marker suddenly gripped the marker with an ease of a younger man. Skin which had been creased and wrinkled, smoothed over. When he seemed to be on the border of hitting 40, both his cardigan and his bifocals vanished, leaving Mr. Song in just a plain shirt and tie. His gray hair giving way to dark brown with gray streaks as he re-entered his 40s.<br />
<br />
As the years sloughed off of Mr. Song, and he rejuvenated to his 30s, gray hairs had completely vanished from his hair, and Mr. Song had stopped to roll up his sleeves to his elbows before stopping to look at the brain teaser on the board, thinking for a moment, and then picking up the dry eraser and wiping the board clean before starting again--on a clearly less tricky brain teaser from the look of things. Not much changed from his 20s to his 30s--perhaps his clothes now fit a bit more snugly on his lean build, but it was clear that even as a young man, Arthur Song had never been all that into sports.<br />
<br />
As Arthur shifted from a working professional, to a student teacher, Jeff noticed he quickly looked around--as though expecting another person to be observing him. Luckily this phase quickly ended as Arthur soon left his young adulthood and became a teenager--his clothes shifting immediately from that of a button down shirt, tie, slacks, and loafers, to a slim fitting American Eagle t-shirt, jeans, and a pair of sneakers. The briefcase next to the desk now transformed into a backpack. Jeff also took note that the otherwise neatly cared for haircut that Arthur had had all through his adulthood, now suddenly grew a bit longer and slightly shaggy, the edge of his bangs to dip down to his eyes, causing Arthur to brush his hair out of his eyes idly before quickly grabbing his backpack, looking around and then grabbing a seat next to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff, did you and Alicia have any fun over Spring Break?&quot; asked Arthur suggestively. Jeff for his part, decided to ignore that comment--after all, it wasn&#39;t like Art would remember any of this in a few moments anyway.<br />
<br />
Art&#39;s lean teen years soon had him growing thinner--his shoulders narrowing, and a few shrink spurts hitting, which brought him closer and then through to the other side of puberty rather quickly. Art&#39;s lanky and awkward phase was over in almost the blink of an eye as he returned to pre-adolescence. His once snug t-shirt and jeans, becoming a bit less snug against him, and just having a normal fit to him. Soon Artie&#39;s feet began to pull up from touching the floor while sitting to kicking against the legs rather idly as he continued to grow ever younger, leaving the double digits of life for the singles. His hair was back to being rather well kept and neatly arranged. Jeff knew that Artie was a Kindergartner when he had lost all his adult teeth, and was missing his two front teeth both at the same time. His t-shirt now featured Iron Man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, could you take me to my class?&quot; asked Artie, as he got out of the chair, and put on his backpack. Jeff&#39;s memories began to catch up at this point--Artie was his youngest adopted brother--and was a very dutiful young boy who often looked to Jeff and Tommy for help with things--especially Tommy with whom he had a close relationship as they shared a room and a lot of interests in common.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Artie, let&#39;s hurry before the bell rings,&quot; he said standing up and then taking his new little brother&#39;s hand and escorting him out of the room and towards the Kindergarten class.</p>
