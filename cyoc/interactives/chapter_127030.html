<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun hung low already. Sam had been walking for hours, only to be met with nothing but sand. On the ground lay trails of small... smaller creatures. On other places lay carcasses of animals that couldn&#39;t stand the intense heat of the sun in this area. The sweat was forming on his forehead. It ran down his face, only to fall down to the ground when it couldn&#39;t hang on to his chin any longer.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s body then absorbed all water around him, which was scarce. As a result, his shirt and pants both were dry, the salt on them violently grazing his olive skin. His feet were covered in blisters, as well as his hands, but both for different reasons. After having walked non stop in the hot sand for hours, the skin he walked on was tearing itself apart, not being helped by the friction.<br />
<br />
Sam occasionally switched hands with which he was holding the magic lamp, to give both the relief they so desperately needed. It was as if he was carrying pieces of burning coal in his hands from time to time. The only thing he could still touch was the lamp&#39;s handle. The rest had pretty much molten under the intensely burning sun.<br />
<br />
Only  as the sun was setting, the temperature seemed to be getting a bit more tolerable. In the afternoon, Sam&#39;s walking pace was still steady, uninterrupted, with the strong hope he&#39;d be finding civilization, or at least an oasis, as soon as possible. Now, in the evening, perhaps almost night-time, his pace was much slower. The burns and blisters on his feet had played a big role in it. But his mind, suffering a splitting headache thanks to dehydration, had now given up on life. Only instincts seemed to bring him further. He was mindlessly moving further.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the setting sun, it was finally getting a bit cooler everywhere around Sam. His throat had become dry over time. Just this afternoon he wished for not being thirsty anymore, but he should&#39;ve wished for a permanent version of it, as this comfort had disappeared entirely by now. All the water he &#39;drank&#39; still had to be relieved, he realized.<br />
<br />
Sam was standing there looking around him, in the middle of the slowly cooling desert. In front of him, still was nothing. Looking to he sides, he&#39;d have to climb a large desert bank, but he knew his body couldn&#39;t cope with that anymore. Behind him, his own footsteps were visible. His battered hands were covering his crotch, he needed to pee.<br />
<br />
And he was so thirsty. Should he drink his own pee?<br />
<br />
No, that&#39;s ridiculous!<br />
<br />
He had an idea, but knew it wasn&#39;t going to be pleasant.<br />
<br />
He removed his shirt, exposing his upper body to its now chilly surroundings. Sam hadn&#39;t seen the sun for a few minutes now, so the temperature was lowering, and the darkness was expanding.<br />
<br />
The nipples on his chest reacted to the chilly surrounding, something he&#39;d never experienced before, but now that he was a girl...<br />
<br />
No wait! Nothing has been confirmed yet! When was that conclusion made? His second wish didn&#39;t work, maybe he was still male after all!<br />
<br />
Then again he&#39;d felt nothing, no reaction from his member whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Firstly he removed his shorts. They were gray and stained with dust. Underneath them feminine curves could easily stay hidden. Now his legs and butt were exposed to the world as well.<br />
<br />
Sam first felt around his boxers, ignoring the burning feeling of the blisters on his hands and fingers at the slightest contact. First touching his buttocks through the white fabric, he quickly noticed they were swollen, just like his chest area. It indicated the same unwanted change. He brought one hand underneath the fabric, going downwards from where his butt cheeks started. It was still unshaven, and a finger touched and hovered above what he knew was his asshole. So that part of his anatomy had stayed the same, as expected. His fingers followed the same path downwards, slowly and carefully. Skin seemed to loosely hang down, indicating the start of his scrotum. He pulled his finger out.<br />
<br />
Sam then pulled up his boxers to his belly button, and leaned over. He was once again that day horrified by what he saw. There wasn&#39;t a familiar bulge present underneath the fabric, he couldn&#39;t see it down there. What he saw was, for him, worse, namely a camel toe.<br />
Touching it, he confirmed what he saw. Going from left to right with a finger, his crotch was bulging out, then caving in, only to bulge out a second time. Why didn&#39;t he inspect this sooner? He was trembling in shock, then fell down, his soft ass landing on the desert surface.<br />
<br />
So he IS a girl...<br />
<br />
During this state of shock, Sam also felt a faint relief. Looking down, she saw that she was wetting herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Sam exclaimed. She picked up his shirt, which had fallen on the ground, and then pulled off her boxers. Next, she held the shirt underneath her crotch, still letting the stream go.<br />
<br />
As the stream stopped, Sam squirted out the last jets of urine, and then held the shirt in front of her.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s shirt was now wet, still salty, and smelt gross. Her headache had worsened however, and her thirst wouldn&#39;t subside anytime soon. Using her right leg as support, she rolled up his shirt, making sure no water would be squished out of it. Next, she brought it around her head, knotting it tightly so it would stay on its place. It looked similar to a turban.<br />
<br />
Her boxers now were wet as well, thanks to her panic, but what would it matter? She put on both her boxers and her shorts again, making sure she wouldn&#39;t be entirely naked during her travel. Why did she have to make such a choice anyways? Both cases would only result in surviving just a little longer. By the end, Sam would probably collapse to the heat. Or the cold, she realized. Deserts could reach temperatures below zero degrees Celsius at night, which confirmed the goosebumps she was getting all over her body.<br />
<br />
A cloud of steam escaped her mouth at every breath, as the dry air around her took it in.<br />
<br />
__________<br />
<br />
Sam could barely move on after another couple of hours walking. The last couple of minutes it had turned into a painful crawl, as her leg muscles were cramping thanks to the cold and the lack of water they&#39;d gotten the past day. Eventually she fell down on her side. With a last effort, she managed to get herself lying on her back. Sam was out of breath, as her life force was metaphorically sucked out of her. It was a starry sky that night, but all dots, were more of a faint blur to Sam. Her eyes closed, and her breathing slowed down.<br />
<br />
Sam was practically dead. The muscles of her hands were still clamped around the magic lamp.<br />
<br />
This same lamp emitted a blue glow once again, and Sam&#39;s body reacted by doing the same.<br />
<br />
First, her feet seemed to stretch out, eventually forming some sort of tail. This tail was sucked into the lamp via the spout. Sam&#39;s entire body was sucked in until only the magic lamp remained.</p>
