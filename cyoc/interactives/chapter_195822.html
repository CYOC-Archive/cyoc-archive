<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In came Caroline Hammer, Melissa&#39;s roommate. Caroline is a Caucasian girl who stood at 5 feet and 4 inches tall. She had a pretty face with green eyes and light blonde hair that went down to her back. She was one of the few girls Melissa knew to be in an engineering major so she was pretty hard working and headstrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heya Melissa! You finished with classes for today?&quot; Caroline cheerfully asked as she set down her back pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, so just chillin for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, cool,&quot; Caroline then laid back down on her bed, browsing through things on her phone, leaving Melissa to her own thoughts.<br />
<br />
Turning the Transformation gun over in her hands, Melissa decided to try the gun out for fun. If it worked great, and if it didn&#39;t then it was a prank done well. Looking over to Caroline, Melissa had some suspicion that this was a prank instigated by her roommate as the blonde girl was totally absorbed in whatever she was doing on her phone, suspiciously so like she was intentionally ignoring Melissa. Plus Caroline was an engineering student, so she could have made a techy looking gun as a prank. Yup, Melissa decided to use the gun on her roommate. Discreetly pointing the sci-fi looking weapon at Caroline, Melissa briefly wondered how the gun was going to know what kind of transformation she wanted as it had no input panel or screen or anything, yet it was just a thought and she playfully pulled the trigger expecting nothing to happen.<br />
<br />
The gun glowed a bit before it silently shot a thin almost invisible ray of blue light, hitting the oblivious Caroline. Melissa waited for Caroline to say prank or for the gun to explode into a glitter bomb, but nothing happen. Caroline just shifted on her bed so that the front of her body faced Melissa, with her phone still up to her face. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary,  Melissa was kind of disappointed as the mystery was unsolved, as the gun was not proven to be a prank or real. Melissa was about to put the toy away and get some homework done, when some movement caught her eyes. This was because this movement was spotted at an unnatural location on Caroline&#39;s body, something was undulating under her roommate&#39;s leggings!<br />
<br />
Caroline was a college girl, and like many college girls she liked to wear cute stylish clothes. On this day Caroline was wearing black leggings with a tank top covered with a sweater. Currently Melissa could see a weird tubular shape pushing outward on Caroline&#39;s soft lower wear. It inched up toward the blonde&#39;s stomach before the head of the thing escaped the confines of cloth revealing the object to be the pink mushroom head of PENIS! The now confirmed dick continued its travel, growing longer and girthier like an overgrown plant in a pot too small. Yup, Caroline&#39;s legging had become crowded as 2 orbs filled in like maturing fruits from the vine joining the branch of a cock. Seeing the bulging veins on the meat stick and the noticeable throbbing meant that it was erect, rock hard, an raring to fuck. Melissa&#39;s horror and wonder was interrupted by a soft shriek as Caroline noticed her new attachments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coraline, you have a huge fat cock!&quot; Melissa said helpfully, unsure of how to react,&quot; Oh, and some large balls too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nuts, damn what the fuck! I have a dick. I have a cock on me! Melissa, what am I going to do? This can&#39;t be happening! Girls don&#39;t just magically grow balls,&quot; Caroline continued her freak out, sort of hovering her hands around her erect meat sword not wanting to touch it lest she confirmed that it was real. <br />
<br />
Melissa knew that this occurrence was caused by her transformation gun, which was proven to be real. She was sort of having an internal freak out herself now, as she was debating whether to tell Caroline the truth or not. She could fix her roommate by secretly using the gun again, but she didn&#39;t even know how the gun worked or how it picked it&#39;s transformations. She certainly didn&#39;t have a concrete image of a final transformation at the time she pulled the trigger, but maybe it was decided by thought. Her train of thought was broken when she saw Caroline&#39;s phone. On the screen was a silent video close up of two fornicating people, it was a porn video. Caroline was watching porn when Melissa was in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caroline, were you watching porn?&quot; Melissa asked sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Caroline stopped her babbling of disbelief to turn red from head to toe,&quot; Uh, yeah, but like everyone watches it from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I was in the room, do you get off from watching porn in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No. No of course not,&quot; Caroline&#39;s dick noticeably throbbed, now oozing a steady stream of clear precum, &quot;Why do you think that? Anyway we should be worrying about why I now have male equipment, not about what I do in private!&quot; She was clearly more embarrassed about the porn watching thing now than her visibly huge shaft of lustful flesh.<br />
<br />
Oh, maybe since  Melissa didn&#39;t have a set transformation in mind, the gun used whatever was running through the subject&#39;s head as a base of transformation. Caroline was definitely thinking about cock when Melissa pulled the trigger. <br />
<br />
Feeling sure of how the gun worked, Melissa cheekily grinned, &quot;Maybe you grew a schlong because you wanted it? You clearly wanted something long and hard, you know since you were watching P, O, R, N. Hey, I was wondering do you still have your vagina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish fulfillment? That doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. I must have ate something bad, or have some genetic disorder or something,&quot; using her hands, Caroline explored the depths below, &quot;MELISSA! I can&#39;t feel my pussy. It&#39;s not there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s new information, uh ok. We&#39;re going to gather as much information as we can before doing anything. By the way, are you going to cover up your shaft or just hang free like some perverted exhibitionist?&quot;  Melissa said to not draw suspicion to herself, she&#39;ll turn Caroline back at a more opportune time.<br />
<br />
That was when Caroline made a face that was embarrassed, confused, surprised, reluctant, and pleasured all at the same time. She covered her face with both of her hands as her towering cock shook, pulsed and throbbed. The orbs in her leggings tightened up, and precum flowed like water down her shaking shaft. Then with one last pulse it grew harder than steel, as it belched and squished out globs upon gooey globs of sticky white strings of cum into the air. Arcs of jizz shot up and out like a wild machine gun, raining down upon the blonde like hellfire. A testament to her true exhibitionist pervert nature, that she had kept hidden from Melissa.<br />
<br />
Melissa now had a cool transformation gun, and the knowledge that Caroline Hammer, her roommate, was a pervert who watched porn in public and got off from being exposed. The hands free ejaculation continued on for a good minute and a half, painting Caroline white, if not for the burning redness of humiliation on her skin.</p>
