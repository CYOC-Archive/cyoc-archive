<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There wasn&#39;t much to see in one direction, because from their starting point, Ben Twist the werewolf and werepanthress Kenya Adaeze would soon come to the edge of the town park at the end of the trail they were on, so instead they started in the other direction, back towards the hill near Ben&#39;s house.<br />
Along the way, Ben pointed out a few landmarks here and there. Nothing of true historical significance, but enough to help any were navigate the woods even on a totally moonless night.<br />
In time, Kenya looked down to see that Ben had taken her paw in his. When he realized what he had done, Ben started to pull away, but instead, Kenya held his paw tightly in hers as she moved a little closer to him. Ben felt his heart beating a little faster as he enjoyed the sensation, and even slowed down his pace a tad to prolong the walk.<br />
<br />
As they started to approach the base of the hill, Ben stopped in mid-step and pulled Kenya behind the closest tree.<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; asked Kenya, tensing as she assumed a defensive stance.<br />
&quot;No. I just didn&#39;t want to interrupt them,&quot; replied Ben, as he pointed to two figures at the top of the hill.<br />
Kenya looked and saw two boys, neither much older than Ben, standing at the top of the hill, hugging and kissing each other.<br />
&quot;Thankfully we&#39;re downwind from them, so Nate and Alex don&#39;t know we&#39;re here. We&#39;d better turn around and go back.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know them?&quot; asked Kenya, as they started to leave.<br />
&quot;They&#39;re friends and classmates,&quot; answered Ben.<br />
&quot;They look like a cute couple,&quot; commented Kenya, as they walked away.<br />
<br />
Soon the werewolf and the werepanthress found themselves back to what Ben thought of as &quot;their spot&quot;, the fallen log by the stream.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to explore the rest of the woods some other night, but this stretch of forest goes on for another 7 or eight miles past that hill,&quot; revealed Ben, as he let Kenya sit first before taking a seat next to her.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen a map of Moon Lake, and love all the wide open spaces as part of the town,&quot; said Kenya.<br />
&quot;Something the town founders planned ahead for when Moon Lake was first settled, to allow weres a chance to roam and be free.&quot;<br />
&quot;This place is so lush and unspoiled, not like New York City.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you have Central Park?&quot; asked Ben.<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t as big as Moon Lake. Plus, even there, a were has to be careful not to be spotted,&quot; pointed out Kenya.<br />
&quot;Do you miss it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Honestly? No. New York City may be where I lived and grew up, but Moon Lake is fast becoming more like home every day,&quot; said Kenya with a smile.<br />
<br />
Then the conversation grew still. When Kenya couldn&#39;t wait any more, she turned to Ben and asked, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; admitted Ben, looking more at Kenya&#39;s knees than her face. &quot;Since my first transformation, I&#39;ve had plenty of sex on a regular basis, and didn&#39;t think twice about it. But now, since I&#39;ve met you, you&#39;re on my mind on a lot, but most of my thoughts aren&#39;t about sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Kenya, wondering what Ben was getting at.<br />
&quot;I think more about how your day was, what it&#39;s like without you around, how great it is when you are around, whether or not you miss me when I&#39;m not around, let alone whether or not we&#39;ll still be together years from now,&quot; said Ben, raising his right paw to scratch the back of his head.<br />
&quot;Ben Twist, are you falling in love with me?&quot;<br />
The werewolf looked directly at the werepanthress and said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenya smiled and kissed him. A slow, gentle kiss of love, without the emotionless rush of lust.<br />
When their lips parted, Kenya revealed, &quot;I have felt very intrigued by you since the moment we first met. There is something very special about you that has touched my soul, and I would like to get to know you much better than I already do.&quot;<br />
Ben smiled, but was unable to speak as Kenya continued. &quot;However, know this. I do not play games with my heart. Whatever is between us must be allowed to grow naturally. Tomorrow, I will check with the campus legal department to make sure I am not breaking any rules in regards to what some might call &#39;contributing to the delinquency of a minor&#39;. Meanwhile, I would like you to arrange a meeting between me and your mothers so I can be properly introduced and have their permission to continue this relationship.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can do that during breakfast and let you know the answer afterward,&quot; promised Ben. &quot;But what about me meeting your parents?&quot;<br />
&quot;That will not be necessary until we have reached the point where you are prepared to ask for my paw in marriage.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Marriage? I never thought things through</i> that <i>far, but it doesn&#39;t sound like a bad idea,</i> thought Ben.<br />
&quot;Let us hope fate and the gods are on our side, and we can continue to see each other. Otherwise, our relationship will have to remain strictly platonic until you are of legal age to continue it in a more serious nature.&quot;<br />
&quot;Serious nature?&quot; asked Ben, needing clarification of the term.<br />
&quot;Dates, our possible marriage after you graduate college if our relationship develops that strongly, sex.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Ben, nervously scratching the back of his neck again. &quot;I&#39;ll be 17 in March, and a Senior next fall.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am a college sophomore and will be 21 this December.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t look it,&quot; said Ben.<br />
&quot;Thank you. Whatever happens, I hope we shall forever remain friends, but I am truly looking forward to the possibility of getting to know you <i>beyond</i> that,&quot; said Kenya, before kissing Ben again.<br />
<br />
The two fledgling lovers sat closely on the fallen log as their body fur rubbed together, holding paws and talking the evening away, only interrupted by regular intervals of kissing; until their respective cellphone alarms started to chime.<br />
&quot;Early class tomorrow,&quot; said Kenya, reaching for the waist pack on her hip that blended in with her fur so well.<br />
&quot;School,&quot; replied Ben, reaching for the lanyard around his neck.<br />
They stood up while holding each other&#39;s paw, then physically embraced to enjoy a final kiss.<br />
&quot;Good night, my Ben,&quot; said Kenya, as she started to take a step away, back toward the town park and home.<br />
&quot;Good night, dear Kenya,&quot; said Ben, unaware there was a small tear in the corner of his eye.<br />
Kenya gave him one last smile, and then scampered up the closest tree to disappear in its foliage.<br />
Ben stared at the last spot he actually saw Kenya, long after she disappeared.<br />
<br />
All the way home Ben thought about Kenya, what it was actually like to be in love for the first time in his life, and wondering what the future held for the two of them.<br />
When he arrived home a little after 10 pm, still in his werewolf form, Ben was surprised to find his mothers sound asleep on the couch in their werecat forms.<br />
The two women were within each others furry arms with happy smiles on their faces and actually purring in unison as they slept!<br />
Ben realized what a loving home he had been raised in, and hoped that when the time came, he and Kenya would have the same kind of household for their family.<br />
He shifted back into his human form and took a couple of discreet (only from the shoulders up) photos of the happy couple with his cellphone, then Ben went quietly to his room with a happy smile on his face as well.</p>
