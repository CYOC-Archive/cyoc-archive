<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria&#39;s lips twisted into a smile.  &quot;I guess I can handle the produce on my own time.  But wait!&quot;  she exaggerated her movements to point toward her daughter&#39;s udder.  &quot;We can&#39;t let you go around with that thing uncovered!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna knew there was no article of clothing on the planet that could cover the jiggling mass attached to her gut.  &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t you seen the looks you&#39;ve been getting?  The muffled laughter?  While it&#39;s legal to leave your udder exposed, it&#39;s just shy of a woman walking about topless.  However, I&#39;ve made one major difference: instead of it being an object of sexuality, your udder is a clear marker of your promiscuity.  With how large and how exposed you&#39;ve left it, I can only wonder what they thought of you.  You may have been more subtle if you&#39;d stripped off your clothes and presented.&quot;  As if to emphasize the problem, she thrummed her fingers along the top of Joanna&#39;s udder, causing her daughter some discomfort.<br />
<br />
How did she even manage to do that?  Making it normal was one thing, but changing how people perceived it in such a specific way was insane.  It did explain the leering glances, or why those parents redirected their child down a different aisle after seeing her.  If it was fully abnormal, she&#39;d have caused a much bigger panic, and if it was just seen as an exposed breast, she&#39;d have been removed by mall security.<br />
<br />
She sighed.  While she didn&#39;t particularly care to leave this massive thing hanging, this was apparently the next thing her mom decided to waste time with.  &quot;They don&#39;t exactly make udder-covers, so what do you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, that&#39;s why we&#39;ll have to get a second opinion, from a tailor! I fortunately had some time to search for the right place, and it&#39;s not too far away by car.&quot;  She grabbed Joanna&#39;s hand, then started guiding her out of the mall. <br />
<br />
Glad to finally be leaving the mall, she followed her mother with little resistance, apart from the natural resistance her body caused when it tried to move.  She got to the passenger&#39;s seat, and realized just how little space she had left to sit in the car.  Her bulbous rear left little space for her udder, and it was already too large to slip between her legs within the confines of the vehicle.  Instead, she was forced to squish her udder into the dashboard, causing the milky mass to demand it be emptied.<br />
<br />
She tried to move the chair backwards, but it was already as far back as she could set it.  She waited for her mother to get in the car, but apparently she was busy playing with her phone once again.  Even though each pulse of growth to her udder was minor, it was more than enough to make her even more desperate to get out of the car.  &quot;Mom, please get in the car, this is painful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such a crybaby.  This will only take a minute.&quot;  She continued twiddling with the phone.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t stand being in the car for one minute, and there was no way she&#39;d stand however long the drive itself was.  She fumbled with the chair once more, trying to pull it further back even though that was impossible.  As she flailed her hand across the side of the chair, she realized something: it could be reclined!<br />
<br />
Leaning the seat back as far as possible, her udder began to angle upwards more than forward.  Though her breasts were completely blocking her view of the windshield and she could only imagine how ridiculous she looked from the outside, the pressure was greatly reduced.  &quot;Okay mom.  Take your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother looked up, scoffed at her daughter&#39;s solution, then got in the car.  After starting the car, she started to fondle the upper left teat of the udder.  &quot;Look at how big it&#39;s gotten.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m sitting next to a person-sized cow udder.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she continued to tweak the teat, Joanna realized her mother wasn&#39;t joking.  She knew her mother didn&#39;t have small hands, but it felt positively tiny as it wrapped around the udder&#39;s teat.  That thought was quickly drowned by how badly she needed release, as her mother&#39;s playing had seemingly primed the teat into demanding it be serviced, immediately.  She groaned in agony as the primary bulk of her udder throbbed, having been sufficiently fooled into thinking it was about to get milked by her mother&#39;s ministrations.  <br />
<br />
She tried to think of something that felt as bad or worse than this, but the closest she could imagine was constipation but there was truly no hole to get it out of.  She simply did not have the muscles to squeeze it out.  Without thinking, she feebly began to reach to the teat.  Consequences be damned, she needed to milk it.<br />
<br />
She was sent hurtling back into reality when her mother suddenly grabbed hold of the teat and twisted, hard.  The pain of being unmilked was replaced with the pain of her sensitive appendage under duress.  &quot;What did I say about milking this?  Wait.  Until.  You&#39;re. Home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna tried to find the right words.  &quot;Please, I need...It, hurts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, that&#39;s what punishments are supposed to do.  Hurt.&quot;  She gave the udder a hard slap, causing it to tremble in place as a red spot formed.  She started up the car, and Joanna decided to count the minutes it took.<br />
<br />
*    *    *<br />
<br />
34.  It took thirty four minutes to reach this tailor.  During the ride, she felt the udder slowly use more and more of the dashboard as support, until the car finally slowed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here.  Get out of the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna didn&#39;t realize how much harder it was going to be to get out of the car compared to getting in.  She couldn&#39;t sit the seat fully back up, because she couldn&#39;t willfully shove her udder into the dashboard like she had the first time around.  After several minutes of feeling like a turtle on its back, she eventually managed to get herself out of the vehicle.<br />
<br />
Approaching the front door, she averted her eyes from some passing customers, several of whom stared wide-eyed at her udder.  Most concerning was one man that questioned another about her potential availability, which distressed her further.  Then there was the line to the front desk.  She didn&#39;t properly measure the distance between her udder and the man in front of her, causing her to accidentally squish it into his legs, causing him to turn around.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was--&quot; he gasped and backed away slightly, averting his eyes.  &quot;Uh, okay.  Please don&#39;t, uh, touch me with, that.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was several more minutes of standing in line, until the front desk called for the next person in line.  She approached the front desk alongside her mother, who took the initiative.  &quot;Hello, we&#39;re here to see a tailor.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The clerk looked at Joanna, did a double take on the monstrous udder hanging just below her breasts, and returned her focus to Gloria.  &quot;Of course.  This does seem like something of an emergency cover-up.  I&#39;ll set you up with one of our faster designers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, can you get the slowest one?  I want to make sure quality work is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk glanced to Joanna again.  &quot;There&#39;s no change in price and the store stakes its name on the quality of all its tailors.  If something is not made correctly, we&#39;ll fix it free of charge.  Your daughter seems like she could use an immediate coverup, but if you want slow and steady, so be it.&quot;  She handed Gloria a ticket.  &quot;He&#39;s currently on his lunch break.  Will that be a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all! Perfect, in fact!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood.  Please wait in room 12.&quot;  She dinged the buzzer.  &quot;Next!&quot;</p>
