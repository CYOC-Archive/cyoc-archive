<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Lilianne saw that cocky, preening preppy boy step into her spa and wellness center, she knew she would be seeing something special today. She didn&#39;t know if he was gonna go the distance in the one sauna, but she knew that upon seeing that smarmy little grin, full of practiced confidence and prep school ego, he didn&#39;t know what he was getting into. He didn&#39;t know what he was getting into, and this was probably going to be one of the more entertaining transformations to watch. She was certainly going to be glued to her crystal ball, her eyes enrapt. Hell, she might even invite Clyde over for a regular viewing party. <br />
<br />
Daniel Hawthorn walked in wearing a Burberry Coat, an American Eagle polo shirt, Lululemon Jeans and tricked out sneakers that she swore probably still had the 400 dollar price tags still attached. He had thick, wavy brown hair, bright blue eyes, and a light, slightly pale countenance - indicating through the physique teased through his clothes that he likely achieved none of it through day labor. All those muscles contained under there were from gym workouts. After all, it wouldn&#39;t do for a man like Daniel to <i>work</i>!<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t exactly a bodybuilder - but he was superbly athletic. Built trim, lean, and visibly muscular. The kind of abs that looked good on the beach lurked under that polo. But it was clear by some factors. The breadth of his shoulders. The way he led with his chest... it was clear that Daniel harbored some ideas about being bigger. Being some kind of muscle man. Even if he wasn&#39;t exactly well informed about it yet.<br />
<br />
Daniel leaned against the desk as Clyde turned from his work to look at the young man, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve heard this is the Crafter&#39;s Spa and Wellness place, right? One of the best spas in the area, am I right? I mean, people even say that you&#39;ll look hotter after you&#39;re done.&quot; A grin rested on those dimpled cheeks, &quot;Well. Hard to improve upon perfection. But I&#39;d say I got...interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll find that our services do quite readily make for substantial improvements,&quot; Clyde said with a bright smile. &quot;You&#39;ll know once you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite some confidence there,&quot; Daniel responded, crossing his arms, &quot;Gotta say it has enhanced my curiosity.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, Lilianne was on her way over, eager to meet this egotistical boytoy herself. The ones with ego like Dan were most often the most entertaining - and most often contributed to her daily pleasure after they were done. As she entered the front office, she sashayed over toward Daniel - whose eyes immediately wandered over to her the moment she entered. The top she wore, flaunting her breasts so, likely contributed. She could see his smile turning into an excited horndog&#39;s grin.<br />
<br />
For all the propriety, the preppies were still young men - and most often, were so used to maintaining that propriety that they were especially pent up by the end of the day. And that was usually when they found their way to a spa. And in this case, hers. And on her part, she walked over and asked, &quot;Is the young man interested in being...serviced?&quot; She knew well enough what she was doing to him. She didn&#39;t need a love potion to kick that into gear.<br />
<br />
And she didn&#39;t need to use a spell to peer through his clothes to see the erection tenting those expensive jeans. My, oh my, he had quite a deal of size on him. Daniel was predictably forthcoming when it came to a private display of his wants, &quot;Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. This more than made my decision for me.&quot; He propped himself up on the counter, approaching Lilianne, trying to impress on her how impressive he was. That was the foremost for people like him - appearances.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear it, Mr. Hawthorn,&quot; she looked over her shoulder and led the way further into the sauna and steam room. She looked over just long enough to see him bite his lip and tilt his head, and begin to follow - almost falling over his own shoes in the process of keeping up with her. My oh my, Lilianne thought as she walked, it did seem he was indeed a pent up sort. She almost felt surprised he hadn&#39;t humped anything. <br />
<br />
Lilianne finally opened up a door leading to the main spa room, leading to the sauna room - calibrated for aging. She decided she could feel free to indulge and enjoy herself. &quot;Please take a seat on one of the massage couches...and take off your---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I cannot <i>wait</i> to get outta this all.&quot; His voice was heavy with desire. She turned and watched him - eager but still measured - removing his clothes article by article. All the way up until his box apparel underwear hit the floor, leaving the young man standing there with a big smile on his face, utter unearned confidence across his face, and his athletic, muscular body on full display. He tried to flare his shoulders wider to make himself seem even more impressive - which Lilianne just found adorable.<br />
<br />
His erection, however...well. Well! At 18, he had an eight and a half inch cock. Honestly, she couldn&#39;t wait to get her hands on it both before and after the change. &quot;Please take a seat on the massage couch, Daniel.&quot;<br />
<br />
The preppy boy walked up closer, and grunted, &quot;Can---can we just...skip to the happy ending? I&#39;m so fucking---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you&#39;re pent up, Daniel.&quot; Lilianne smiled, &quot;And I can make it even better for you if you just sit back, lie down, and enjoy the massage.&quot; Lilianne gestured to the massage couch. And Daniel glanced at her, biting his lip, looking down at his cock. He breathed, and walked over. He lied down on it, chest down and ass up - to accommodate that monster of a cock.<br />
<br />
Lilianne figured she could do this sometimes. Especially when the clients amused her enough. <br />
<br />
She moved in on him.<br />
<br />
Her hands began to work into those broad, muscular shoulders. Magical energy supplementing her natural skills, digging deep into his shoulders and teasing out any tension from his long workouts in the gym. She could almost see him. Still wearing a short sleeved shirt in the gym, shorts, and sneakers. But when he got home, he&#39;d almost tear the shirt off and he&#39;d just flex for his bathroom mirror. A big smile on his face. So proud.<br />
<br />
And so sensitive. Daniel was already moaning and grunting as she knelt over him. And those moans and grunts only got louder as she worked her way down. Easing out any strain or tense sensations from his back, his lats and even his chest. As she reached around and cupped his chest, she started rubbing his nipples, pinching them, and then going back to a rub. This made Daniel gasp, and start almost humping at her massage couch. A blush crossed his face.<br />
<br />
She knew the next part, given his over-macho hetero boy thing, would likely embarrass him a bit. But it did these boys good to see that there was pleasure they had no idea about.<br />
<br />
Lilianne began massaging Daniel&#39;s ass, and the preppy grunted, gasped, and let out cute little exhalations. She began working her hands all over that well toned derriere, making the young man try to articulate a response, &quot;My---my oooh, my---ass!?&quot; He had utterly no idea that young men had a pleasure center in and around their ass - and a big one further inside it.<br />
<br />
Putting on a glove, Lilianne lubed up her hand and began pressing two fingers into Daniel&#39;s tight anus. This made him groan and thrust against the massage couch, strangled, surprised noises uttered from his throat. His hands shook, and his face was red with embarrassment. True to form. Yet Lilianne kept going deeper, pushing her fingers in and out, easing him into it. And she could see his cock pulsing, that eight and a half incher throbbing with delight despite his indignant noises. Indeed, even as he said &quot;I---I&#39;m a <i>man!</i> What&#39;re you doing to me back theeeere---&quot;<br />
<br />
Well. He made utterly no effort to actually stop her. He didn&#39;t want to admit it, it seemed, but he very much enjoyed this. And then Lilianne found it. Felt her fingers brush against his prostate. And this made him moan deeper, and, being utterly inexperienced with anal pleasure, Daniel promptly hit his orgasm with a thunderous roar. &quot;OOOHHHHHH FUUUUUUUUUCK, BABE!! FUUUUUUUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilianne just stood back and withdrew her hand, watching his cock pump out a hefty load on the massage chair. She threw away her glove and looked him over, &quot;Enough of a happy ending for you, Mr. Hawthorn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, oh fuck that was something else...&quot; Daniel was still laying there. Still blissed out of his mind. Luxuriating in the afterglow. He got back up on wobbly legs, grinning, still trying to come off as this cocky, capable guy. &quot;I uh...I think...ahem. I believe I&#39;m ready for my sauna experience.&quot; His cock still dripping with some cum, Lilianne promptly walked over, and wiped a couple beads off of it with her bare hand, watching him tremble and shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy it, big boy.&quot; And with that, Lilianne left. And as soon as she was out, she had her crystal ball ready. Eager to see how long he&#39;d stay in the sauna. Excited to see what state Daniel would be in once he was done.</p>
