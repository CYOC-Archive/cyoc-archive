<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh was ecstatic.  He had been looking forward to the Mythical Renaissance Festival ever since he first heard about it months ago – and now here they were!  <br />
<br />
“This is amazing!” He adjusted the pig-snout strapped to his face.<br />
<br />
His boyfriend, Ian, wasn’t as excited; he felt stupid wearing the wolf-ears, wolf-paw leg warmers and gloves,  and wolf tail Josh had insisted on.  <br />
<br />
They passed a very detailed painting of a satyr displayed artfully on an impressive large old tree stump, heading deeper into the Transformative Woods.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, amazing,” Ian muttered, clearly bored out of his mind.  Then when he saw Josh’s disapproval at his attitude, added a half-hearted “Rawr” and laid a paw on one of Josh’s prosthetic pig teats jutting from Josh’s  chest and belly.  Ian had to admit, what he referred to as &#39;Josh’s little pig slut suit&#39; was actually very well done and quite elaborate.<br />
<br />
Josh couldn’t help but laugh at Ian’s antics.  He slid his boyfriend’s paw off his ‘pig boob’ as Ian himself was smiling now, good-naturedly. “Come on Ian – you promised you’d give this a try,” Josh coaxed.  “You know I always support you.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay, I’m sorry babe,” Ian relented.  He couldn’t argue with that – Josh had been nothing but indulgent of Ian’s love of football ever since they met, even though Josh had no interest in the sport himself, and was much more the creative sort.  Ian would never say so, but Josh could be so gay, it was a little overwhelming for Ian at times.  Ian was bisexual, and despite loving Josh, his tendencies ran much more traditionally male than his boyfriend.  But one of the reasons Ian loved Josh was the other young man’s feminine qualities, which definitely appealed to him.  He pinched the pig boob again, smiling, “I have to admit, you make a really sexy pig slut, Joshy.”<br />
<br />
“Aww,” Josh snuggled his boyfriend as they rounded a bend in the Transformative Woods exhibit.  “And you’re the only wolf for me.”  He oinked playfully and Ian just shook his head with a grin.<br />
<br />
Then, noticing their surroundings, Ian’s eyes widened with wonder.  He whistled in awe, his voice quiet.  “Wow, they really went all out.”  The couple were the only ones on this particular branch of the road, and it was impressive.  Ian felt like he had stepped out of a cheesy prop-laden fair and into an old horror movie.  The woods were somehow foreboding and mysteries here, darker despite the partly sunny day.  They didn’t feel like they were in New Jersey anymore, but in a much more distant old-world forest.  There was an old, elaborate stonework wall up ahead and a large iron gate with statues on either side.  Some of the trees themselves must have been props because they looked so gnarled and ancient, and even the birds had stopped chirping in this part of the woods.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” Josh felt it too – the atmosphere was somehow different here.  He looked at the gate and statues as they approached.  “Those set pieces are amazing.  Even big studio movie props aren’t this detailed.<br />
<br />
“Hey look,” Ian pointed to the statues – one on one side of the gate a ferocious looking werewolf, and the other a feral were-pig.  “It’s us.”<br />
<br />
“No way,” Josh whispered absently of the strange coincidence, looking at the beautifully sculpted and painted were-pig at one side of the gate, complete with inlaid gemstones.  “The craftsmanship is amazing…”<br />
<br />
Josh jumped when a large black raven burst from behind the wall, taking flight with a “Caw”.  “Dang, that was freaky,” Josh tried to laugh it off, but was glad to be in Ian’s arms.<br />
<br />
“Relax, babe,” Ian whispered sweetly to his love.  “I won’t let any mean old werewolves get you.”  He kissed Josh on the cheek.  The snout looked cute on Josh, but then Josh could make anything look cute.  “Wow, I can’t even see a seam.”<br />
<br />
Josh hugged against his boyfriend, more shaken than he wanted to let on.  He loved how the open shirt exposed Ian’s very hairy chest; the hair looked thicker and fuller than ever. “Dang, you’re one furry wolf.” Josh played with Ian’s chest hair.<br />
<br />
Both men looked into one another’s eyes, and slowly became aware of something primal overcoming them… gradually, reality seemed to transform around them, or they were transforming, it all became hazy and not fully clear to them.  They couldn’t stop themselves from giving in to what happened next.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Rob and Sarah did all the Renaissance fairs they could every summer.  They had gone so far as to get authentic period outfits, which they currently wore.  Yes – they were that quirky, creative couple that everybody knew.  The Mythical Renaissance Festival seemed even too quirky for them, but they decided it could be fun to try something new – and if they were guilty of anything, it was always trying something new.<br />
<br />
So here they were, walking down a wooded path in their period garb, not sure what to expect, but enjoying each other’s company nevertheless.<br />
<br />
“Dost thou approve, my fair lady?” Rob asked his young wife, arm in arm, doing his best middle-English accent.<br />
<br />
“Most certainly, my dear husband,” Sarah responded in kind, marveling at the beautifully rendered painting of a satyr up ahead.  She giggled, “Truly a most transformative art festival.”<br />
<br />
The couple heard a squeal echo through the woods.  Sarah was so startled she broke character.  “What was that?”<br />
<br />
Then another squeal, followed by the howl of what could only be a wolf.  Rob and Sarah looked at one another with anxious eyes.  “It sounded close – too close.”<br />
<br />
More squealing, grunting and howls ensued, and Sarah felt her heart pounding in her chest. The couple found themselves wandering further down the path, cautiously following the sounds.  After all, Rob reasoned, this was a festival – surely there was nothing dangerous here; it must be some act or exhibit.  It sounded like a massacre at first – Rob imagined a wolf making dinner of a wild pig.  But the closer they got, the more the sounds actually seemed… erotic was the only word that came to Rob’s mind, though he couldn’t say why.  There was a quality in the sounds that more resembled rutting than slaughter.<br />
<br />
The howling and squeals reached a crescendo, climaxing in an impressive cacophony the likes of which neither of them had ever heard before.<br />
<br />
Silence followed.<br />
<br />
Rob and Sarah turned a corner, and came upon an old stone wall that must have been ten feet tall, with a wrought Iron gate blocking the roadway.  To one side was a strange large statue of such intricate detail and craftsmanship that even Rob and Sarah were impressed.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s beautiful,” Rob said in a hushed voice.  The large statue depicted a powerful furry werewolf in the throes of love-making with an obese were-pig.<br />
<br />
“It’s strange,” Sarah looked at the werewolf curiously.<br />
<br />
Its mouth open in a fanged howl, muscular neck atop powerful broad shoulders.  A work that revealed savage unbridled power and lust.  The furry chest and abdominals, V-shaped torso was actually right down hot, Sarah thought to herself, and the fur was so expertly sculpted and painted that it looked real.  It’s long bushy tail snaked around, and its powerful legs and claws were as impressively sculpted as the rest of it.  Powerful muscular arms reached out, somehow holding the subject of its lust and forever reaching for a breast, despite the other creature’s massive size.  An impressive monster erection jutted from the werewolf’s crotch, impaling its lover with erotic realism, large balls hanging beneath.  Even the detail of the balls was breathtaking – sculpted to look as if they were contracting in mid-orgasm just like real balls do.<br />
<br />
The were-pig – or more specifically – were-sow wasn’t just huge, it was the very definition of obese.  Its massive pink round hide expanded out in what appeared to be soft, heavy rolls of flesh.  Its titanic belly was only dwarfed by the massive sow teats that hung off of it, jewels expertly laid in place for each nipple.  Its huge, fertile body posed in the throes of ecstasy, snout open in mid-squeal, hooves pressed up against its furry lover&#39;s strong back and chest.  Piggy pussy impaled by the werewolf’s massive, engorged cock.  The curly little piggy tail above its very wide ass was the crowning touch.<br />
<br />
Rob and Sarah stared in silence, turned on by the erotic art before them.<br />
<br />
A few more people joined the couple, staring silently at the massive, erotic statue forever capturing these two were-lovers in their epic orgasmic adventure.  Somewhere within, Ian and Josh were frozen helpless in endless orgasm, their true natures and bodies lay bare and on display for all to see and enjoy for eternity.</p>
