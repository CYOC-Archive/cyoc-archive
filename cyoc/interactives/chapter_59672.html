<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff grew taller until he was a full 6'4&quot;. This explained why his clothes had to change. There was no way that his old clothes would fit him at <br />
this size. But Jeff wondered why he wasn't increasing in muscles. He was more athletic but it seemed like he was built more for agility and <br />
speed then for raw strength. He was also surprised that he became less hairy instead of more. He could not tell if he'd aged or not because at <br />
seventeen, he was nearly an adult anyway. Some things about him seemed to be more adult but some things, especially his hair, seemed to be <br />
more child-like.<br />
<br />
Jeff explored his room as things began to settle. He no longer had a bed. He had a large cushion that he could curl up in. He lost a lot of his <br />
furniture especially all of his shelves and books. His computer was reduced to a much simpler computer and all his computer games were <br />
gone. What was left of the computer was attached to the Chronivac emitter and Jeff was grateful that enough remained that he could still <br />
access the Chronivac if he needed too. He thought that the only reason the Chronivac had saved his computer was for that very reason and <br />
otherwise, the Chronivac would probably have erased the computer right along with the shelves. As it was, the computer was now tucked away <br />
in the closet as if in long term storage. Jeff looked through his clothes as the clothes he now wore didn't fully cover him but he noticed that all <br />
his clothes were strange. He no longer owned any normal human clothing. Jeff pulled out the Chronivac so he could get a closer look at what <br />
all changes had been made.<br />
<br />
The first options listed described Jeff physically and confirmed that Jeff was still human. Several of his stats were not average but they were still <br />
within normal limits. His penis was now an impressive twelve incher. Despite his unusual length and lack of hair, or maybe because of his <br />
unusual length and lack of hair, he looked very handsome. His muscles weren't large but they were trim and well defined. His now blond hair <br />
was shaggy but it added to his whole new look of playfulness. <br />
<br />
Then Jeff saw the options for mental change. The Chronivac had altered his thinking patterns as well. His memory was still intact and because <br />
of that, he was partially aware of the mental change but it felt completely like he was being himself. For example, his old self would have <br />
panicked about having such strange clothes to wear but his new self felt completely comfortable. Jeff decided to examine himself in the mirror <br />
and he had mixed feelings. To a point, he felt like laughing at himself because he looked so ridiculous in such a brightly colored outfit that <br />
failed to cover his front. To a point, he felt completely humiliated and disgusted that his outfit displayed his body so explicitly. But then he also <br />
felt to a point like his new outfit was just right to suit his new personality. Looking at the Chronivac further, he saw several references to his <br />
new pet-like or dog-like mentality. It was strange because he was still intelligent. In fact, the Chronivac had increased his intelligence <br />
significantly. The references to a pet mentality were in regards to his personality and preferences.<br />
<br />
Jeff spoke to the Chronivac, &quot;So where did you get the idea that I wanted the mind of a dog in a human body?&quot;<br />
<br />
He noticed that mental suggestions were sent to everyone within 100 miles so that they would also be comfortable with Jeff's new life. So he <br />
decided to put the Chronivac in storage again and give this new life a try at least for a while. He did want to find some clothes that covered <br />
him better as a compromise with his memories of his old self that couldn't adjust yet. He found a coat that was very colorful and long enough <br />
to cover him but he found no pants, shorts or underwear so the coat would have to do.<br />
<br />
He found that he now had new toys. These toys were like a cross between dog toys and kids toys. He found a small punching bag that he could <br />
bat around but it wasn't secured to anything so he could chase it after he hit it. He took it into the back yard and spent time batting it around <br />
the yard and found it to be very fun.<br />
<br />
Finally his parents came home. It was Saturday but his parents had been out running errands. His dad, Mike, came out into the back yard.<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;Hey there, boy, having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Yes, dad. Is this okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;Why wouldn't it be okay? How about we go to the park and play fetch for a while?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Don't you notice anything different?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;You're mom musta got you a new coat. You know I think it's silly how she insists on dressing you like that. I'd prefer you to be <br />
dressed more simply. It's a little embarrassing to be seen playing fetch with a son dressed in such ridiculous costumes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Do you want me to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I'll take care of that. Come on inside and give me a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff came up beside his dad and Mike played with his sons hair. They went inside and Jeff talked with his mom as she began to make dinner. His <br />
mom also spoke with the same ease that Mike had. Mike excused himself briefly and came back in clothes more fitting for fun in the park. <br />
Then he said, &quot;Alright son, let's get you changed so I won't be so embarrassed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike reached up and began to undress Jeff. Jeff asked, &quot;Why are you undressing me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike asked, &quot;Why are you asking that? Is there something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff's mom added, &quot;I dressed you in that coat this morning. You must like it. Mike, honey, let him wear it to the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;No, he looks ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Mike continued to undress his son and Jeff's mental changes caused him to be almost okay with being stripped in front of his mother. Mike <br />
said, &quot;He sure seems to have grown. Wasn't he a lot smaller yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff's mom said, &quot;Well he is about to become an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Jeff was naked, Mike went into Jeff's room to fetch something. He came back and attached a collar with I.D. to his son's neck. Mike said, <br />
&quot;We could get in trouble if you are out running around without your collar.&quot; Then Mike attached a leash.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Do I have to wear a leash?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike asked, &quot;Are you forgetting your training and need to go to obedience school again? The park has a large area where I can let you off your <br />
leash but until we get there, there's a leash law.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was thinking about how this might work out on Monday at school. He wondered if he'd need a leash then or if people could be persuaded <br />
that he was human enough to skip the leash. But for now, he decided to go along with it in the spirit of adventure and wishing to experience <br />
new things.<br />
<br />
Then Mike began leading Jeff out the front door. &quot;Is this all I'm to wear?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;All your outfits are so ridiculous. You look far more respectable now than you would in any of those foolish clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Mike took Jeff to the park to play fetch. On the way, they met several neighbors and every one of them acted like it was perfectly normal for <br />
Jeff to be naked and on a leash. Mr. Smith was walking his dog at the time and he stopped to talk with Mike while Jeff and Mr. Smith's dog sat <br />
and waited.<br />
<br />
Mr. Smith asked, &quot;Your vacation coming up next week. Have you decided what to do with Jeff yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;No. We could take him with us but those pet carriers can be expensive but leaving him behind in a kennel would be even more <br />
expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Smith suggested, &quot;Perhaps, you could leave him with me and he and Rascal here could keep each other company.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;You're not leaving me behind, are you? I was looking forward to the trip to the coast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike patted his son on the head and said, &quot;I don't want to leave you behind but traveling is difficult for a pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Can't I at least stay home by myself. I am a human after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I suppose that would be alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff suggested, &quot;Or maybe I could stay with friends. Some of my friends were planning on going hiking. I should be free to go without a leash <br />
because I'm a human adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;You're right of course but I'll still look into buying a pet carrier for you because I'd really prefer to take you with the family this <br />
vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued talking and then Mike tugged on the leash and Jeff stood up.<br />
<br />
Mr. Smith said, &quot;Your son has a fine coat.&quot; He began to pet Jeff with long strokes that went all the way from Jeff's shoulders to Jeff's ass. &quot;What <br />
do you feed him that keeps his coat so shiny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I just make sure he gets plenty of real meat and none of that processed dog food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Mr. Smith patted Jeff on the rump as he said his goodbyes.<br />
<br />
Later Jeff whispered to his father, &quot;I'm not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I know you're not, son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Why'd Mr. Smith pat me on the ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike patted Jeff on the ass as he answered, &quot;Because you like it. Doesn't it feel good? Yes, doesn't it feel good, doggy?&quot; Mike began massaging <br />
Jeff's back and this included massaging the area of Jeff's tail bone. Jeff enjoyed it but didn't want to enjoy it. Mike continued, &quot;Maybe when we <br />
get home, I'll give you a bath. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn't answer. He wondered just how much he was going to experience with his new life.<br />
<br />
At the park, some of Jeff's friends were there playing frisbee. Jeff talked Mike into playing frisbee for a while as well. This was the closest Jeff <br />
had gotten to living a normal human life since the Chronivac had changed everything but even playing frisbee, there was a tendency for <br />
everyone to expect Jeff to fetch the frisbee and bring it back to one of his friends. About half the time they allowed Jeff to toss the frisbee but <br />
about half the time, they acted surprised that Jeff could toss a frisbee. Then because Jeff was naked, he got some of the typical locker room <br />
teasing about his big cock. But otherwise they treated him like the same seventeen-year-old and human Jeff he was yesterday.<br />
<br />
After frisbee, his friends gathered to pet Jeff for a while before they headed off. They even had Jeff get up on a picnic table so they could <br />
admire him. &quot;He sure is an excellent dog. Have you thought about entering him in a dog show. A son that looks that fine could win prizes.&quot; <br />
Mark began examining his face. &quot;Even his teeth are pearly. You don't see too many dogs with such fine teeth as your son Jeff here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason kept patting him on the ass and saying, &quot;Good boy. You ready for the science test Monday. You're such a good boy. Mr. Yakamoto is so <br />
boring. I wish I had a good doggy like you are. I'd teach you to do tricks like get A's on that science test tomorrow. I wouldn't make you sleep <br />
on the floor. You could sleep on the bed with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I'm not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason patting his ass, &quot;Who said anything about gay? I don't intend to breed you. You'll be the only dog in my room. In fact, I believe in spaying <br />
and neutering pets.&quot; Jason suddenly lifted Jeff's leg and because of surprise and because of Jeff's mental changes, he let his leg be lifted as he <br />
nervously allowed Jason to lift his balls for his father to look at. &quot;I'm surprised you haven't neutered this big boy yet. Aren't you worried that he <br />
might make puppies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I've thought about it. I too am in favor of neutering. I guess I just never got around to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Don't neuter me dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I know you don't like the idea but it would be for your own good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Don't you want me to have grandchildren?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;Well, yea. I'll think about it and decide later. I do wonder though when you go off to college how will we keep you under control?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason, who had let go of Jeff's balls but still had his leg lifted said, &quot;Give him to me. I'm going to the same college. He'll be neutered but I can <br />
take care of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;I don't feel like making any decisions today. I don't know why I feel this way. Maybe it's the suddenness of this. Yesterday my son <br />
was playing computer games and today we're talking about neutering him.&quot; Mike held Jeff's balls up for a closer inspection, &quot;I know it ought to <br />
be done but I can't make that decision today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike attached Jeff's leash and lead him home. Mom had supper waiting for them and by this time, Jeff was not surprised to see his steak and <br />
potatoes served to him in a dog dish on the floor. Later that evening, Mike did give Jeff a bath in the back yard just the way a dog would be <br />
bathed. Strangely, they talked more like father and son during the bath than they had talked for years. The only difference besides having his <br />
father lather him with soap while being in the back yard was that Mike would occasionally slip and refer to Jeff's dog-like life.</p>
