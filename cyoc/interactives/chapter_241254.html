<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Making their way to the car, Tom and Alexa put the car in drive. Their first case together was a simple one. Several blood banks in the suburbs of East Hartford had been robbed recently, those stolen supplies being blood. Considering the likely culprits were vampires, Alexa and Tom now made the 90 minute journey north, plenty of time for the partners to get to know each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Alexa asked, adjusting her glasses. &quot;You going to be okay with this case?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom raised an eyebrow, his vision trained on the road in front of him. The young man offered to drive, being more familiar with the interstate. &quot;Yeah I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; he said. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Alexa replied sheepishly. &quot;It&#39;s just...we&#39;ll be interviewing vampires. After what your cousin said, I would think you wouldn&#39;t be comfortable being around them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom let out a small chuckle, shaking his head at Alexa&#39;s question. &quot;Vampires I can handle,&quot; he stated. &quot;Ann though...well she&#39;s on an entirely different level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa nodded, completely agreeing with Tom&#39;s assessment. One of her favorite hobbies since joining S.P.E.A.R was perusing their extensive archives. Significant figures within the supernatural community often had files on them. Tanuki comedians, Matt the Dragon King and his mother Tiamat, the kitsune, wizards, the vampire lords, and of course Ann. Needless to say, the information and intel on Ann was nightmare fuel. &quot;Good point,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Honestly, after everything I&#39;ve read, you&#39;re lucky to be alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t realize S.P.E.A.R kept records on Ann,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we have all sorts of records,&quot; Alexa said excitedly. &quot;Ann&#39;s file may read like something out of Stephen King novel, but alot of the other files are really interesting. Like for example, did you know some of the greatest physical comedians in history were Tanuki?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry what?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah according to S.P.E.A.R they were Tanuki&quot; Alexa said. &quot;They were only able to stay in the mortal realm for so long before having to return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom simply shrugged, astonished by Alexa&#39;s information. He always found the trio hilarious, he just never knew he was watching supernatural beings perform. &quot;Wow that&#39;s actually pretty cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah history has always been a bit of a passion of mine,&quot; Alexa blushed. &quot;Ever since I was a kid. Growing up, I wasn&#39;t an athlete or cheerleader or even prom queen. I was kind of just another face in the crowd. Decent grades, dull life mostly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by what you&#39;re saying you read through my dossier,&quot; Tom smirked. Alexa blushed, offering a meek apology for snooping on her new partners background information. Tom grinned, a small small snort of laughter escaping his mouth. &quot;Guess I was a bit of a try hard as a kid,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah S.P.E.A.R kind of keep a detailed file on all the wizards in the area,&quot; Alexa replied. &quot;When I found out you were going to be my partner, I decided to do some digging. You were the all American kid in high school and college. Popular, athletic, intelligent. Honestly, made me feel a bit insecure. I never thought I did anything as significant as you did. Hell, I felt under qualified when I applied to S.P.E.A.R.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you impressed the Director when you applied,&quot; Tom said reassuringly. Alexa now offered Tom a small thank you, as the man drove in silence for a moment. From Alexa&#39;s perspective it seemed Tom was contemplating something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something on your mind partner?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sort of,&quot; Tom shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t like going into detail about it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can tell me,&quot; Alexa stated. &quot;I promise I won&#39;t judge.&quot; Tom fidgeted, only peaking Alexa&#39;s interest more. &quot;Tell you what, you tell me what it is and I&#39;ll go into the details of my childhood. Only seems fair. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom raised an eyebrow, taking a sideways glance at the Nekomata woman. His knowledge of Nekomata was limited, however, from what he heard , they were intensely curious as well as flirtatious. So far, he hadn&#39;t seen the flirtatious side of Alexa, but she most certainly was curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even the embarrassing stories?&quot; he asked. Alexa nodded, causing Tom to take a breath before continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has to do with Ann,&quot; he said. &quot;Not so much what she did to me, but what she did to my sister Yuriko.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom took a breathe, his eyes now focusing on the road ahead. All at once the memories of that traumatic moment came tumbling back, as if he had opened a long sealed vault. &quot;It was after my sister was rescued,&quot; he said. &quot;I remember it, almost clear as day. Akira returned her to our home late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira,&quot; Alexa exclaimed. &quot;The guardian? He&#39;s kind of a legend, even among kitsune. He rescued your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s kind of a family friend,&quot; Tom said sheepishly. &quot;Always watched out for Yuriko and our godparents Mia and Zack.&quot; Alexa simply gaped, wanting to ask more about the Harris families connection to the famous kitsune warrior before Tom interjected. &quot;Can I finish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa quieted once more, her attention completely focused on Tom as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard everyone come back,&quot; he continued. &quot;Woke me up, I snuck out of my room and peaked downstairs to see Akira talking with my folks. Couldn&#39;t quite make out what they were saying. They were just happy to have Yuriko back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think any parent would,&quot; Alexa commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Tom said. &quot;I notice my dad cradle Yuriko and carry her upstairs. Quickly I ran for my room, pretending to sleep. Yuriko&#39;s room was across from mine, he laid her down in her toddler bed and left. When the coast was clear, I snuck across the hall to see her. She seemed okay, but..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt guilty,&quot; Tom sighed. &quot;I apologized to her. Hugged her, making sure I didn&#39;t wake her up. I let her down, I&#39;m her big brother. I was supposed to protect her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom,&quot; Alexa said softly. &quot;You were a kid. What were you five? Maybe six? You said so yourself when you were talking with your cousin, Ann unlocked your magic. How was a small child supposed to protect her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I should have,&quot; Tom replied bitterly. &quot;I guess...I guess that explains why I&#39;ve always tried to over achieve. Be it sports, as a cop, and now...this. I...I guess I&#39;m just trying to make up for that one, big, unforgivable mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa said nothing, simply studying her new partner. Tom&#39;s expression jade darkened, his brow furrowed as they continued to drive. For several moments the car was silent until a warm smile spreading across Alexa&#39;s face. The nekomata reaching over to gently squeeze Tom&#39;s hand. &quot;You did nothing wrong,&quot; she said sweetly. &quot;And Me and Yuriko are both lucky to have you watching our backs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tom smiled, a small chuckle now escaping his lips. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever opened up to anyone like that before. Is it a nekomata ability or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alexa chuckled in confusion. &quot;But my folks said I was always very empathetic. They thought I should&#39;ve been a psychologist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Tom mused. &quot;So, now that I&#39;ve opened up its your turn. C&#39;mon Alexa time to spill the beans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, taking a breath. &quot;Nothing too exciting really. I grew up in Lancaster, Ohio, about 30 minutes south of Columbus. It&#39;s a real small town, maybe 50,000 people. Both my parents are Nekomata. Dad is a supervisor at a paper mill. Mom works as a hairdresser. I have two brothers, my older brother Jared is a mechanic. My little brother, Reed, is a Senior at Ohio St.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re a middle child?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Alexa shrugged. &quot;But I&#39;m also the only girl, so I never had classic middle child syndrome.&quot; Tom nodded, motioning for Alexa to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;High School I was never really part of a clique,&quot; she said. &quot;I was never a cheerleader, I wasn&#39;t a goth, never learned how to play an instrument so wasn&#39;t a band kid.&quot; Alexa chuckled, thinking of her past. Tom already lived such an exciting life, by comparison hers seemed so malaise. &quot;I was just a regular kid. Had a few girlfriends that I hung out with all the time. Dated a few boys in high school and college. Always kept my secret about being a Nekomata though. My parents told me to be careful because humans wouldn&#39;t understand. Made for some bland family projects in grade school. Always said my family roots traced back to England.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Tom replied, drawing a laugh from Alexa.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to humor me,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Let&#39;s face it I&#39;m not exactly the stereotypical Nekomata. The classic sexy cat girl with huge knockers just dripping with sensuality. I grew up just a regular Midwestern girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I think you&#39;re very interesting Alexa,&quot; Tom said. &quot;I just have one question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I say O H are you legally required to respond with I O?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa burst into laughter, playfully shoving Tom as the car swerved. Regaining control, the partners laughed, exchanging more small talk as they continued on their way. The ice effectively broken, both Alexa and Tom looked forward to working togethe</p>
