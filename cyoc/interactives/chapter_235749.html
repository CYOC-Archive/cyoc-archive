<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Clowngoggles grinned as he inspected the row of newly regressed baseball players. These once-mighty athletes now stood nervously before him, transformed into gangly, awkward 10-year-old boys who barely filled out their oversized uniforms. But the good doctor wasn’t done with them yet—not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
Among them, Jake &quot;The Hammer&quot; Harrison, the team&#39;s former captain, was the most defiant. Despite his shrunken body and squeaky voice, he stood firm, crossing his small arms in front of his chest. &quot;I don’t know what kind of twisted game you’re playing, Clowngoggles, but you need to turn us back—now! I’m a grown man, not some little kid!&quot; His voice cracked embarrassingly as he spoke, but his glare held firm.<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles chuckled, adjusting his rainbow goggles as he sauntered over to Jake. &quot;Oh, Jake, you’re adorable when you try to act tough in that puny little body. But I think you’re missing the bigger picture here. You see, this isn’t just about shrinking you down in age. It’s about transformation. Total, complete transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrison’s eyes narrowed. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I’m so glad you asked!&quot; Dr. Clowngoggles pulled a strange new device from his lab coat—a sleek, metallic gun with an absurdly large, bulbous barrel. &quot;Allow me to introduce my latest invention—the Goofball Gun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrison took a step back. &quot;Goofball Gun? What the hell is that supposed to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles&#39; grin widened. &quot;Oh, it’s simple, really. You see, regressing your body was just the first step. Now, we’re going to have some fun with your mind!&quot; He twirled the gun theatrically before pointing it directly at Harrison’s chest. &quot;Let’s just say that after a few blasts from this bad boy, you won’t be so worried about being a ‘grown man’ anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrison’s heart pounded. He clenched his tiny fists, his childish features flushing with anger. &quot;I am a grown man!&quot; he shouted. &quot;I don’t care what you’ve done to my body—I’m still Jake ‘The Hammer’ Harrison, and I’m not some goofy little kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles smirked, his finger hovering over the trigger. &quot;We’ll see about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a press of the button, the Goofball Gun emitted a glowing swirl of pink and purple energy, enveloping Harrison in a sparkling mist. He staggered backward, his body bathed in the strange light, and for a moment, he could feel a bizarre sensation spreading through his mind—like something was tickling his brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;No… no, stop!&quot; Harrison shouted, shaking his head as if trying to shake off the effect. &quot;I’m… I’m not… I’m not a kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles stepped closer, eyes gleaming with excitement. &quot;Oh, Jake, it’s already starting. You’re going to feel those serious, grown-up thoughts of yours slipping away, bit by bit. You’ll try to hold onto them, of course, but the more the Goofball Gun works its magic, the less you’ll be able to resist. Before long, you’ll be giggling at fart jokes and thinking about nothing but candy and cartoons!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrison gritted his teeth, trying to hold onto his adult thoughts. But the fog in his mind was growing stronger, making it harder to concentrate. He blinked rapidly, as if trying to clear his head, but strange, silly ideas started popping into his brain. For a fleeting second, he thought about how fun it would be to hop on one foot… then he shook his head again, frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I’m Jake Harrison! I’m—&quot; He stopped mid-sentence, suddenly feeling a weird urge to make a goofy face. He fought it, but his lips started to twitch. &quot;I’m… not a… silly kid…&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles watched gleefully. &quot;Oh, Jake, it’s so fun watching you fight it! But let’s turn up the intensity, shall we?&quot; He pressed another button on the Goofball Gun, sending a second wave of energy swirling around Harrison’s head.<br />
<br />
Jake staggered again, feeling his control slipping further. His arms felt heavy, like they wanted to flail around. His legs wanted to jump and skip. A giggle—high-pitched and boyish—escaped his mouth before he could stop it. &quot;No… no, this can’t be happening… I’m not some… goofy little—&quot;<br />
<br />
Another giggle slipped out, this one louder. His mind was being bombarded with ridiculous thoughts—like how fun it would be to stick his tongue out at Dr. Clowngoggles or start making airplane noises. He clutched his head, trying to hold on to who he was, but it was no use.<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles leaned down to his eye level, grinning widely. &quot;You see, Jake, the Goofball Gun doesn’t just make you feel silly. It rewires your brain, replacing all those serious, grown-up thoughts with goofy, childish ones. Soon, you won’t even remember what it was like to be an adult. You’ll just be a fun-loving, silly little boy—forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake’s eyes widened in horror, but he was losing his grip fast. &quot;No… no! I’m not a silly little—&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jake burst into uncontrollable laughter. His mind, overwhelmed by the effects of the Goofball Gun, couldn’t resist anymore. He slapped his tiny hands against his knees, laughing so hard he snorted. &quot;Heh-heh! Oh man! Did you see how big my shoes are?!&quot; He pointed down at his too-large sneakers, doubling over in laughter. &quot;I look like a clown!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Dr. Clowngoggles said triumphantly. &quot;And now, my dear boy, you are a clown—a little goofball, just like I promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake tried to speak, but all that came out were more giggles and silly noises. His serious adult mind had been completely overwritten by goofy, childish impulses. He stuck his tongue out at one of the other regressed players and made a loud raspberry sound, then broke into a dance, flapping his arms like a chicken.<br />
<br />
The other regressed baseball players, still in shock from their own transformations, watched as their former captain, the once-imposing &quot;Hammer,&quot; now pranced around the field like a hyperactive child. His dignity, his pride, and his entire adult personality had been replaced by the carefree silliness of a 10-year-old boy.<br />
<br />
Harrison paused in his goofy dance, looking up at Dr. Clowngoggles with wide, innocent eyes. &quot;Hey, Doc!&quot; he called out, his voice full of childish excitement. &quot;Can we have ice cream after this? I really, really want ice cream!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Clowngoggles grinned, pleased with his handiwork. &quot;Of course, Jake. Ice cream for everyone! But first, we’ve got a few more games to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Goofball Gun had done its job perfectly, and Jake &quot;The Hammer&quot; Harrison was no more. In his place stood a goofy, giggling 10-year-old boy with no memory of his former life, ready to embrace whatever silly adventure came next.</p>
