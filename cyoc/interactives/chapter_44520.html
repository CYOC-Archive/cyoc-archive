<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn't seem like Megan was going to leave and you didn't want to look around on your own. You had this feeling that Zelnorph could still be around and you did not want to become his property. Madame Morphia took one of the folders and opened it. She started reading some of it for you and Megan. &quot;We have Anna and Mark Moss here&quot; she began. &quot;He's sixty-three and she's sixty-two and was pregnant when she was sixteen. That pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. It seems she only had one egg that was healthy enough to even become fertilized.&quot; Turning a page she continued &quot;She had been praying to God that she would get pregnant again up until she was forty. After that she prayed that they would be able to adopt at least one child. They've been denied adoption at every turn even though they would seem to make good parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were they denied if they would make good parents?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It says that they were denied because of their religion&quot; Madame Morphia said and then gave a low growl that made you and Megan take a couple steps back. &quot;This is outrageous. Just because they're Christian doesn't give these buffoons the right to deny someone a chance to raise a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I would think you would not want to put someone with a Christian family&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does not matter to me what religion the family is&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;What matters to me is if they will treat the children I place with them well.&quot; She stopped and seemed to calm down. With a heavy sigh she asked &quot;Wo do you think I should place with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with them being in their sixties I would say ad older kid would be best&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
Megan thought for a second and said &quot;I think Sally and Sandy would make good daughters for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so too&quot; Madame Morphia said. Looking at a clock she added &quot;It's time for lunch. Let us go to the dining room.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were surprised by the announcement that it was lunch time. It couldn't possibly be lunch time yet. &quot;Madame Morphia, it can't be lunch yet can it?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Megan cringed and Madame Morphia said &quot;It is lunch time Victoria. I may be a demon but I do not lie. I may bend the truth a bit but I do not lie. Now it looks like Megan expects me to punish you for not calling me Mother. I know that it's a big change for you and so I will not punish you yet. Once your transformation is finished I will expect it though. So now let us go eat lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lunch was a better affair than breakfast had been. You, Megan, and Madame Morphia were the first ones at the table. As the other girls came in they commented that you looked pretty and you would make a pretty girl. This time you weren't bound in the chair this time and you weren't surprised to see the demons bring your food. They had brought you a chicken salad sandwich on whole wheat bread, a salad, and apple juice. There was general talk as you were eating lunch. Afterwords Madame Morphia said &quot;Alright girls, you may go about your afternoon. Sally, Sandy, I want you two to come with me to my office. Megan, Victoria, please wait for our guests to come then show them to my office.&quot; As you got up Madame Morphia whispered in your ear &quot;Do not talk with them until I tell you you can. One of them may be Zelnorph in disguise.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod your head and go with Megan to sit on a porch swing. It was a nice day out and you closed your eyes while you swung. It was very relaxing and you were a little annoyed when you heard a car come up the drive. You open your eyes and see a car that looked almost brand new. A lady who you took to be Anna Moss got out of the passenger side and asked &quot;Could you two girls tell us if this is Madame Morphia's Adoption Home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is&quot; Megan said getting up and curtsying. &quot;Welcome. I am Megan and this is Victoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of them crossdressers I see&quot; the man said gruffly as he got out and you curtsied too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mark hush&quot; the woman said. &quot;Be a little more open minded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Men should not dress as women&quot; Mr. Moss said. &quot;You know the Lord says that everyone should accept their lot in life Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet you're willing to sell your soul to Satan to change our lot in life same as me&quot; Mrs. Moss said. Turning to you she asked &quot;Are you not going to greet us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's really shy when she meets someone new&quot; Megan quickly said. &quot;Maybe she'll get used to you and talk a little later. Right now we'll show you to our mother's office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you child&quot; Mrs. Moss said with a smile.<br />
<br />
You were thankful that Megan had come up with that excuse so fast. Maybe she had seen Zelnorph in disguise before and thought he might be one of these two. As soon as you were in front of Madame Morphia's office Megan knocked and Madame Morphia said &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Moss are here Mother&quot; Megan said peeking her head in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show them in&quot; Madame Morphia said. As soon as you were inside Megan took a seat behind Madame Morphia and you did the same. As soon as Mr. and Mrs. Moss sat down Madame Morphia said &quot;Now, I understand that you want two daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Mrs. Moss asked obviously confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't surprise me if she was a demon&quot; Mr. Moss said snorting a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a matter of fact Mr. Moss, I am a demon&quot; Madame Morphia said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Moss gave a little squeal and immediately started praying &quot;Our Father who art in Heaven, protect us, your children, from this evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need to fear me at the moment&quot; Madame Morphia interrupted. &quot;You do not need to sell your souls to have the children you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't&quot; Mr. Moss asked with a confused look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can pay me another way&quot; Madame Morphia said. Turning to you she said &quot;You can speak now Victoria. Neither of them is Zelnorph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Mother&quot; you said. Turning to Mr. and Mrs. Moss you said &quot;My apologies for not greeting you properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Moss snorted and Mrs. Moss said &quot;That's alright dear. We don't expect young people today to be so considerate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was not that I wasn't considerate&quot; you said. &quot;It's just that I have to be careful for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you do crossdressing&quot; Mr. Moss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Victoria is becoming a girl and my daughter&quot; Madame Morphia said in a dangerous tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't matter if he get's surgery&quot; Mr. Moss said. &quot;He'll be a guy pretending to be a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am changing her to be a girl&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Victoria, please show them your groin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be necessary&quot; Mrs. Moss said as you stood and lowered your panties and lifting your dress for them to see and feeling uncomfortable about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So his penis is inside him&quot; Mr. Moss said. &quot;That doesn't prove anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a closer look&quot; Madame Morphia said.<br />
<br />
Mr. Moss got up and looked closer making you feel even more uncomfortable. When he did he blanched and said &quot;I only see smooth skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;I removed her penis last night along with her body and facial hair. Now perhaps we can get back to business. Victoria, please pull your underwear up.&quot; You did and she continued &quot;This is Sally and Sandy. They are sixteen and fifteen respectively.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Either one of them a guy?&quot; Mr. Moss asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandy was&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Though she is a girl now. If you gave her a DNA test it would show that she's a girl. Does that satisfy you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Demons lie&quot; Mr. Moss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not lie Mr. Moss&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;I may bend the truth a bit or leave something out but I do not lie. If you had not asked me if they had been guys before I may not have brought it up. You are of course free to have her tested if you do not believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll accept your answer for now&quot; Mr. Moss said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a little time to get to know each other&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;You may use the dining room for that. You will be provided with some refreshments if you so choose. You may take up to two hours and then come back here and let me know your decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally, Sandy, and Mr. and Mrs. Moss left the office. As soon as they did Madame Morphia turned to you and said &quot;I'm surprised you showed them your groin so readily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not want to be punished for not doing it&quot; you said looking down. You were still uncomfortable about it but you weren't uncomfortable being naked in front of Megan this morning.<br />
<br />
Madame Morphia sighed and said &quot;You still have a lot to learn Victoria. I would not have punished you for not showing them your groin. I'm sure Megan has told you that I'm a bit old fashioned. One of the things I'm old fashioned about is a girl's modesty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you tell me to do it?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't have if your transformation was complete&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;You would have been a girl and there would have been no questions asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there would have been no need to tell them&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
Madame Morphia nodded and said &quot;That is right. Do me a favor Victoria and get me the files for Sally and Sandy out of the 'Current Adoptable' drawer in the filing cabinet. Also get your's and Megan's out please. You'll find your's under your old name. If you want you may read your own file.&quot;<br />
<br />
You went over to the cabinet and took out the requested files and handed all but your's to Madame Morphia. You read through your file for the next two hours. You were amazed that it had all the details of your life. Even the bowel control problem you had until you were ten. You were interrupted by a knock on the door and Madame Morphia saying &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally, Sandy, and Mr. and Mrs. Moss came in and sat back down. You looked at Madame Morphia's desk and noticed that she had been working on two documents. One had Sally's name on it and the other had Sandy's name. Madame Morphia looked up as soon as they were seated again and asked &quot;Do we go forward with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The girls are really nice&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;They are excited about being placed into a family but they said that they'll miss this place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just have to ask this first&quot; Mr. Moss said. &quot;Where do you find them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I choose them very carefully&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;All the ones that have passed through here had no family or friends who cared about them. This gives them a second chance at life with a loving family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does a demon care about anyone's happiness?&quot; Mrs. Moss asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are those demons who don't&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;All they care about are their own whims.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But aren't you supposed to try to get our souls?&quot; Mrs. Moss asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I do get as many souls as I can&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;With cases like yours I usually demand your soul as payment. Though I am not doing that here. For this one what I want is a box of chocolates for each girl and a dozen roses.&quot; She pushed the papers she had been working on toward them and continued &quot;These contracts state the conditions for placing Sally and Sandy with you. The world at large will believe that you had adopted them when they were ten and nine. There is also a clause that says if you do not do your best by them then I do get your souls when you die. Sally, Sandy, they also state that if that happens I have the right to bring you back here if I choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our memories?&quot; Mr. Moss asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will retain all your memories&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;You will notice that you will also have memories consistent with you adopting Sally and Sandy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Moss had been looking over the contract and asked &quot;We have a trial period of a year?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;It takes some time to truly decide if it was the right decision. If at any time before the year is up all you have to do is call my name. Of course if you want another child after that year you can always call my name and we will see what we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we're welcome here at any time in the future?&quot; Mr. Moss asked reading over one of the contracts.<br />
<br />
&quot;The girls do make friends here&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;All the girls and their families are welcome to come back to see their friends and make new ones. Of course I like to see them too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we should do this?&quot; Mrs. Moss asked as she turned to her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;This seems to be a solid contract&quot; Mr. Moss said looking through it again. &quot;As long as we do our best by the girls our souls will be free upon death. You've wanted a couple of daughters since you miscarried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But can we trust a demon?&quot; Mrs. Moss asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Demons are supposed to be bound by contracts&quot; Mr. Moss said. &quot;These contracts seem to be very solid to me. I don't see any loopholes or any way it can be twisted. I think it's a safe bet that we can trust what's in this contract.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Moss nodded and said &quot;Alright. What do we have to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sign where it says parents&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Sally and Sandy sign where it says child. Then I will sign them and Megan and Victoria will sign as witnesses. Victoria, you'll have to sign with your old name as I have not updated your file with your new name yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
After everyone had signed where they were supposed to Madame Morphia said &quot;If you wish you may stay for dinner which is at seven sharp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can stay&quot; Mrs. Moss said &quot;It will give the girls time to say goodbye to their friends until they see them again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Sally, Sandy, you do not have to be on time now though I would appreciate it if you were. You may go about whatever you want to do now. Show your new parents around if you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally and Sandy said &quot;Thank you Madame Morphia&quot; at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have made us so happy&quot; Mrs. Moss said tearfully. &quot;I'm going to tell my friends about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't&quot; Madame Morphia said. Upon seeing the confused look on Mrs. Moss' face she added &quot;If you did then I would be swamped with requests that I could not grant. It's the same with God. He gets so many requests every day that He can't keep up and has to prioritize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes some sense&quot; Mrs. Moss said. &quot;I'll respect your request then. We'll see you at dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Megan, Victoria, please stay here for a moment.&quot; Once the three of you were alone in the office she continued &quot;I'm going to update your files. Victoria, I need you as witness to my taking Megan as my daughter. Then after your transformation is complete she'll do the same for you. Megan, I need you as witness for Victoria's new name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madame Morphia produced the appropriate papers and you signed were you were supposed to. After Madame Morphia put the papers in the appropriate folders and filed them in their new places. Sally and Sandy's folders went into a drawer marked 'Trial Adoption'. Megan's went into a drawer labeled 'Adopted'. Your's went into a drawer labeled 'In Transition'. Your file was the only one in that drawer. After you were able to do what you wanted until dinner.</p>
