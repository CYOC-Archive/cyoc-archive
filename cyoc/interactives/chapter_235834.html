<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the transformation settled over Jeff, and he recovered from his post nut bliss, he began to think about how the changes might have affected his younger thirteen year old brother, Justin. Before the transformation, Justin had always been similar to Jeff—lean, bookish, and more focused on academics than sports. They were close, bonded by their shared experiences of navigating life under the influence of their father, who had always prioritized intellect and study over anything physical.<br />
<br />
But now, with Peter Scott as his new father, Jeff knew Justin would be different too. There was no way their family dynamic wouldn’t shift. Peter was a man who pushed for physical dominance, athletic prowess, and sheer strength, traits Jeff now embodied, and he was certain Justin would follow a similar path.<br />
<br />
Curious, Jeff reached for his phone and scrolled through recent photos, trying to get a glimpse of his younger brother. The last picture he had of Justin was of the two of them at a family gathering: both of them standing side by side, Jeff taller but still thin, while Justin was a mirror image, slightly smaller but with the same gangly, awkward frame.<br />
<br />
Now, though? The picture was different.<br />
<br />
In the updated photo, Jeff almost didn’t recognize Justin. His younger brother had grown, not as tall or broad as Jeff, but far more muscular and athletic than the kid he remembered. Justin&#39;s arms had thickened with muscle, his chest broadened, and his entire frame seemed more solid, more developed. His face still held some of the softness of a younger teen, but the traces of baby fat had been replaced by sharper, more angular features, just like Jeff’s had.<br />
<br />
The old version of Justin who looked shy and quiet, and who could always be found hiding behind a book was gone. This new Justin looked confident, his posture straighter, his arms crossed over his chest in a way that suggested he wasn’t the timid younger brother anymore. He looked like someone who spent time in the gym, someone who cared about being strong, being noticed.<br />
<br />
Jeff could only imagine how Justin&#39;s mentality had changed too. Just as Jeff felt his own mind shifting, focusing less on academics and more on physical power, it was likely Justin had undergone a similar transformation. No longer would Justin be the quiet, introverted kid who avoided sports or physical activity. With Peter Scott as his father now, Justin would have been pushed from a young age to be athletic, strong, and competitive.<br />
<br />
Jeff thought back at their childhood, he had two sets of memories now, his old memories and new ones. The new ones were filled with trips to the gym with their dad, playing football in the backyard, and being encouraged to wrestle, lift weights, and run drills. Their bond was probably more physical now, centered around sports, competition, and pushing each other to become stronger.<br />
<br />
A strange sense of pride welled up in Jeff. Justin had always been his little brother, someone he felt protective over. But now, Justin wasn’t just someone who needed protection. He was someone who could stand on his own, someone who could match Jeff’s strength and drive. <br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t help but smile. He and Justin weren’t smart, bookish kids anymore, they were confident jocks. He quickly got changed into fresh clothes and left his room, walking down the hallway of to his brothers room. <br />
<br />
Jeff knocked twice on the door and, without waiting for a response, pushed it open. The room was dimly lit, but he could already see the changes that had taken root in Justin in person. His younger brother, now looked every bit like the confident he saw in the picture.<br />
<br />
Justin was seated at the edge of his bed, pulling on a shirt that clung to his well-built frame. His biceps stretched the sleeves slightly, and his posture was straighter, more confident than it had ever been. He glanced up as Jeff entered, and gave a small smile, he would have previously shouted at Jeff for just walking in his room but now there was no awkwardness between them. It seemed they were different now, closer, his memories told him that they two had regularly seen each other naked, and had even jacked off together once or twice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot; Justin asked, his voice deeper and more self-assured that he remembered.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t help but smile as he looked at his little brother, a feeling of strange but undeniable pride swelling inside him. The brother he once felt the need to protect had changed. No longer the lanky kid who looked to Jeff for guidance, Justin now exuded the same athletic confidence Jeff had always envied in others. It was like seeing a reflection of himself in his younger brother, and it made him feel powerful in a new way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wanted to see how you were doing,&quot; Jeff said, leaning against the doorframe, folding his arms over his chest. &quot;You’ve looking good, filling out that tee&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin grinned, flexing one arm playfully. &quot;Yeah, I guess. Been working out a lot. Want to catch up with you&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned, flexing his own bicep. &quot;You’re looking good, man. Big change from where we were a year ago, but got a while to get close to me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, or dad,&quot; Justin said, &quot;thats my goal though, get as big and swole as possible&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled. &quot;Same here bro&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin stood up from the bed, stretching his arms behind his head, his muscles rippling as he moved, the athletic drive that had been passed down from Peter Scott now coursing through him. <br />
<br />
For a moment, Jeff considered how easy it had been to make these changes. The device had rewritten their lives in such a fundamental way, and yet, it all felt so natural now. This was who they were supposed to be, confident, athletic, strong. The smart, bookish versions of themselves had been wiped away, and Jeff didn&#39;t miss it, and Justin seemed to be a much better version of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready to head out?&quot; Justin asked, grabbing a hoodie and slinging it over his shoulder. &quot;We’ve got practice soon, and Coach wants us there early for drills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff replied, remembering the two of them had wrestling practice, &quot;let me grab my singlet and i&#39;ll meet you downstairs&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jeff entered his room he instinctively knew where is singlet was and grabbed it, walking towards the door, he paused for a moment, turning back and quickly grabbing the portable chronivac emitter. Maybe he could have some fun at wrestling.</p>
