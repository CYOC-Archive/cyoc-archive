<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…Bruce was fully clothed and home without any memories of this”.<br />
<br />
Andrew said as he took the card out of the machine. Andrew had made sure to move quickly, after all he didn’t want to let Bruce interfere with what he was planning.<br />
<br />
“You son of a bit-“ Bruce exclaimed before vanishing from the Arcade. Andrew smiled as he listened to sound of silence in the back room. Now that Bruce was gone, Andrew had the machine all to himself. The only problem was that he had ran out of money. All the money he had earlier were in the pocket of his old cargo pants which had ripped just moments earlier leaving his change to scatter across the floor and under the other arcade games.<br />
<br />
“Great that was my entire allowance,” Andrew said annoyed. He realized that he has no choice but to return home. “There’s not a lot to do if you had no money here,” he said disappointed. Andrew exited the back room and made his way out of the Arcade.<br />
<br />
As Andrew headed home he wondered if Bruce would remember his previous self or if reality had altered him to make him believe he was Andrew. As he walked closer to his house he realize he would soon find out. Andrew noticed his parents weren’t home and eager to test Bruce’s memory he rushed inside his house quickly.<br />
<br />
The house downstairs was completely empty but he heard some noises emitting from upstairs. Andrew made his way upstairs to his room where the noise was escaping from. He opened the door to see his old body playing video games on his PC. Suddenly the noise stopped and Andrew noticed his old body turn around.<br />
<br />
“What do you want?” his old voice said annoyed. At this point, Andrew was still unsure if Bruce only believed to be in the wrong body or had mentally become Andrew. After all, Andrew had always gotten annoyed whenever Bruce bothered him but Bruce could have just been playing video games while he waited for Andrew to return.<br />
<br />
“Um… are you mad at me?” Andrew asked nervously. Bruce looked at him with Andrew’s old expression of confusion before speaking. <br />
<br />
“Why would I be mad at you? I just a little annoyed you interrupted me before I finished the match.” Bruce responded. Now Andrew was definitely sure that Bruce had no recollection of the events that had taken place at the Arcade. Even better! The machine must have also alter Bruce”s mind to make him actually believe he was Andrew which made Andrew feel weird considering there were technically two of him now in a sense.<br />
<br />
“Sorry! Mom and Dad just wanted to know if you have anything planned tomorrow.” Andrew lied as Bruce simply nodded his head sideways before putting his headphones back on. Andrew then closed the door as Bruce went back to playing. <br />
<br />
Andrew then realized that if Bruce was occupying his old room it probably meant he had to reside in Bruce’s room. Andrew made his way to the end of the hall and opened his new bedroom door to a foul aroma. The smell of B.O. filled his nostrils as he entered the room. Andrew presumed it was being created by the loads of dirty laundry scattered across the floor of the room.<br />
<br />
“Man… Bruce really needs to clean his room.” Andrew said before realizing that he was now responsible for the task if he wanted to endure sleeping in this room tonight. Andrew groaned as he slowly began picking up Bruce’s dirty laundry and placing them into the unused laundry hamper. He then proceeded to tidy the room while spraying air freshener into the room.<br />
<br />
Although the room looked better when he was finished, Andrew could still smell a faint aroma of sweat. “Whatever.” Andrew said as he laid on his  new bed. However when Andrew laid on the pillow he found something hard hit his head. Andrew stretched his hand under the pillow to pull out a dildo.<br />
<br />
“What the hell!” Andrew shouted in surprise as he flung it to the ground. He didn’t know Bruce was into this or if he was gay. He had always assumed Bruce was straight but the more Andrew thought about it the more he realized how odd it was for his brother to had never have had a girlfriend throughout high school. Especially being the big man on campus with good looks and and an amazing body, Bruce probably could have had any girl he wanted.<br />
<br />
However, the dildo on the ground sure seemed to be proving otherwise. Andrew then found himself began to sport an erection as he eyed it. “Wait! I’m not gay!” Andrew exclaimed. He had a crush on a girl in his history class but he found the thought fading as his body reacted to the dildo’s presence. “I want it up my ass so bad” Andrew instinctively thought.<br />
<br />
Before he realized his actions, Andrew stripped his clothes off and grabbed a bottle of lube he had discover earlier in Bruce’s drawers and lathered it over the dildo and on his fingers. Although Andrew had no experience in what he was doing, it seemed that Bruce’s body knew exactly what to do as he lather his asshole in lubricant before stuffing the dildo up it in a single thrust.<br />
<br />
Afraid it was going to hurt, Andrew squeezed his eyes only to realize he felt no pain. No the only thing he was feeling was pleasure. Or the serious lack of some as Andrew began thrusting the dildo into himself repeatedly. Bruce’s body was already accustomed to his dildo regardless if Andrew had known or not. “Wait! I don’t like this” Andrew said in between moans but his erection and later climax proved otherwise. Andrew laid on Bruce’s bed exhausted and lost in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
“This isn&#39;t good…” Andrew thought. He had gained Bruce’s body which meant he had also gained all of Bruce’s body’s desires. Andrew realized he needed to go back to the Arcade to fix this. Andrew got up and cleaned himself off before redressing and racing back to the Arcade. He found the Arcade empty with a closed sign on the window. “Great! Guess I’m stuck like this until tomorrow” Andrew thought as he made his way back home. Luckily since tomorrow was Sunday, Andrew wouldn’t have to worry about going to high school.<br />
<br />
The next day…</p>
