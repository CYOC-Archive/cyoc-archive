<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look upon your new master waiting for him to say something. After a few moments of silence you decide to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I realize that this is a bit much to take in all at once&quot; you say. &quot;You know, I would like to know my master's name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-c-clarence&quot; your master finally stammers out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-why do you call me m-m-master?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you opened my bottle and it's part of being a genie&quot; you say. &quot;I can call you by your name if you give me permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-what's your name?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I really don't have a name now&quot; you say. &quot;The name I went by no longer applies to me. Let me check something real quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pull out your PDA and look through all the rules. You thought you saw something about your name someplace when you skimmed through it. Finally you find what you're looking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like you get to name me Master&quot; you say. &quot;I'll be known by the name you give me until my time of service to you is at an end.&quot; You put away your PDA in a puff of pink smoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool&quot; Clarence said getting over his shock, &quot;I have a real genie. I can finally get my revenge on those bullies. I guess I should give you a name and I have one in mind. Your new name is Claire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well Master&quot; you say, &quot;my name is Claire. Do you want to make a wish now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; Clarence said. &quot;I wish for unlimited wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can not grant that wish&quot; you say. &quot;The contract between master and genie is for four wishes only.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's bogus&quot; Clarence said. &quot;So I'm your master until I've made four wishes. Is that correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;And until then you have to do what I say?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master&quot; you say, &quot;though there are some restrictions.&quot; You pull out your PDA again and look through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you keep looking at that PDA?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because you are my first master Master&quot; you say. &quot;Also this is my first day as a genie. In fact I had become a genie just ten minutes before you picked up my bottle. Ah here we are. I'm allowed to use some magic without you making a wish though it has to be for small things and to blend in. I can use my magic to protect you as long as you don't intentionally put yourself in harms way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you heal my leg?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see why not&quot; you say. With a nod of your head a pink cloud envelopes Clarence's leg.<br />
<br />
When the cloud cleared Clarence said &quot;It's alright now. I have another question. Is there a specific period of time in which I have to make my wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look through your PDA and say &quot;There is no time limit Master. You can live your whole life without making all four wishes. However, if I hear you say 'I wish' I am bound to grant that wish. It won't matter if you mean it or not, it will be granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I could use up my wishes and not even know it?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems so Master&quot; you say. &quot;If I were you I'd be very careful what you say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I wished to live forever?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that I may be able to grant that Master&quot; you say. &quot;Though would you really want to live forever?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not&quot; Clarence said. &quot;It sounds good at first but I guess it would get boring pretty quick. Not to mention that you'd out live everyone you love. Who needs that kind of heartache?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's pretty much what I have to look forward to Master&quot; you say a bit bitterly. You didn't think what you would be giving up with this job until now. You don't know if genies live forever or not but you think that they far outlive any mortal. You were enticed by the thought of having magic powers. Hopefully your masters will use their wishes quickly so you won't have time to develop any more feelings for them beyond master and genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I need to get home&quot; Clarence said. &quot;I don't know what my mom or dad will say to me bringing a strange girl home with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be a problem&quot; you say. &quot;I'll be in my bottle most of the time so they won't see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You keep referring to that Pepsi can as your bottle&quot; Clarence said, &quot;but you referred to yourself as the Genie of the Lamp. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it has something to do with what genies lived in originally Master&quot; you say. &quot;If you've ever heard stories of genies before then you know that the males lived in ancient oil lamps and the females lived in bottles. I'd guess that the introduction was written by a male genie long ago with no regard for female genies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then&quot; Clarence said, &quot;get back in your bottle Claire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you command Master&quot; you say as you turn into pink smoke and return to your bottle.<br />
<br />
As you land in your bottle again you feel it shake a bit. Everything stays in place as your bottle is tilted quite a bit. It has to be the magic in the bottle. As Clarence carries you home you notice a Disney movie by the TV. You go over and look at the cover. It was 'Aladdin: The Return of Jaffar'. You remember watching it with your family before taking this job. You suddenly shudder as you remember a line<br />
from the movie, 'Destroy Jaffar's lamp and you destroy Jaffar.' You don't know if that applies to real genies but you have no desire to find out. You wonder if there is anything in the manual that covers that. You look through your PDA until you find it. Thankfully you won't be destroyed if your bottle is destroyed when you're out of it.<br />
The worst that happens then is you lose your magical powers and have to reapply for another job. Of course there's no guarantee that you'd get another position as a genie. If your bottle is destroyed with you in it then you could possibly die. You're glad that you chose a Pepsi can as not too many people will destroy a full can of pop.<br />
<br />
You notice that you have stopped moving and the top of your bottle is opened. You automatically change to smoke and leave your bottle.<br />
<br />
When you re-materialize outside of your bottle you notice that, what appears to be Clarence's family, is around you. &quot;Master, what is this?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the only way I'd be able to explain a strange girl in the house&quot; Clarence said. &quot;I plan on stretching out my wishes so I figured you should know my family. This is my mom, dad, and little sister Katie&quot; he said nodding to each of his family members. &quot;Everyone, this is Claire&quot; he said nodding to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true that you're a real genie&quot; Katie said. &quot;I wish to be a princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile and say &quot;I'm sorry, but I can only grant my master's wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No fair&quot; Katie pouted, &quot;I want a wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I give one of my wishes to my sister?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may Master&quot; you say pulling out your PDA, &quot;there are two ways to do it. You can either wish to give someone one of your wishes or you can wish the person's wish yourself. I think the latter choice would be better if you want to spread out your wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may do that later&quot; Clarence said, &quot;right now though I have a question. If I gave you several things on a list and wished for you to grant them, would that be a single or multiple wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see&quot; you say as you look through your PDA. &quot;Ah here it is. 'In the event that your master or mistress wishes for a list to be granted, that is considered as one wish.' Well it looks like you can do that and it will only be one wish. It seems a bit like cheating to me but those are the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have a list for you later&quot; Clarence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well Master&quot; you say. &quot;Will there be anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there is&quot; Clarence said, &quot;I want to make my first wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I await your wish Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that from now on that the bullies who bully me and call me 'Claire' are changed into girls&quot; Clarence said. &quot;Let them and everyone else retain their memories and change all of their clothes into really feminine clothes when they transform. I also want to watch them change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wish is granted Master&quot; you say as you nod your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Clarence exclaimed. &quot;I can't wait to see them change. You know, I'd like it if you were able to watch them change too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can use my magic to blend in Master&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will you do that?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With your permission Master&quot; you say, &quot;I can alter reality so that I appear to be human and everyone will remember me that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will it count as one of my wishes?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not according to the manual Master&quot; you say. &quot;You do have to give me my new identity like you gave me my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will my family still know who you are?&quot; Clarence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they will Master&quot; you say. &quot;I can also give them and you memories of my new identity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent&quot; Clarence said, &quot;now all I need to do is think up a new identity for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about having her as your twin sister&quot; Clarence's mother suggested. &quot;We never told you this but, you did have a twin sister that we named Claire. She died a few days after you two were born.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarence just stood there in shock. You can't blame him as you'd probably be just as shocked if you had found out that you had had a twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master&quot; you say, &quot;do you want me too become your twin sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarence just nods at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well Master&quot; you say. &quot;I will also make it so we are in most of the same classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod your head and start to transform. The first thing that you notice is that you lose some height as you shrink a bit and your sandals disappear. Your breasts shrink down to a c cup. Your hips and butt shrink a bit. You look at your arms and notice that they were getting a bit darker, a tan color like Clarence's mother. Red polish appears on your finger nails and a couple of gold bracelets with Sapphires in them appear on your left wrist. You turn to look in a mirror and watch as your golden blond hair turns to black and comes<br />
out off it's braid. Your hair remains the same length however. Your eyes change from a piercing blue to brown. Your face rearranges a bit becoming a bit rounder, your lips losing a little bit of their fullness and your nose shrinks a little. The last thing to change was your clothes. Your pants changed into a skirt while your tops became a bra and pink tee. White ankle high nylons appear on your feet along<br />
with a pair of black Mary Jane strap ons with just a little heel. The changes finished and you wonder why your choker and earrings didn't disappear. You lift your shirt to see if your navel piercing was still there, it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like I had always thought Claire would have looked had she lived&quot; Clarence's mom said with tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day you and Clarence walked to school and before the first bell rang the first bully came up to Clarence and shoved him into the lockers. &quot;Alright 'Claire', let's see your pretty panties&quot; he said. He started to reach for Clarence's pants to pull them down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to look in a mirror Dan&quot; Clarence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Dan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a look&quot; you say handing Dan your compact mirror.<br />
<br />
Dan's eyes went wide as he saw his buzz cut grew longer. &quot;What the fuck is happening to my hair?&quot; he asked in a higher pitched voice. &quot;What the fuck happened to my voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't appear to be the worst of it&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean Claire?&quot; Ron asks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you seem to be shrinking&quot; you say with a smile on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean I appear to be shrinking?&quot; Ron asks you with panic in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're just about my height now&quot; you say still smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can't be happening&quot; Ron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it's happening alright&quot; you say. &quot;In fact I think your changes are just beginning. If your hair, voice, and height are any indication I'd say that you're becoming a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible!&quot; Ron exclaimed as if by saying it he wouldn't change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like it is possible as you are changing&quot; you say as Ron's clothes suddenly disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to my clothes?&quot; Ron asked. &quot;I have to find a place to hide.&quot; He tried to turn and run but he was unable to. &quot;I can't move from this spot&quot; he said his face going red with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Just then Mrs. Goldwin came upon them. &quot;What is going on here?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron just started to change Mrs. Goldwin&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know why I'm changing&quot; Ron sobbed uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound like a girl Ron&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Ron sobbed.<br />
<br />
What little body hair Ron had receded into his body at that point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't we take you some place other than the hall&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've tried&quot; Ron sobbed, &quot;but I can't move from this spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'll be able to move you&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. She tried tugging Ron from his spot. When that didn't work she tried cover him up with the rain coat she was wearing. However it just disappeared and reappeared back on Mrs. Goldwin. &quot;Well this is a problem&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it&quot; Ron sobbed as his arms and legs became slim and more feminine.<br />
<br />
By this time Ron's transformation had drawn a large crowd. Mrs. Goldwin looked around and said &quot;Alright everyone get to class. Anyone who doesn't get to class right now will get a months worth of detention.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd quickly broke up except for you and Clarence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you two want a months worth of detention?&quot; Mrs. Goldwin asked you and Clarence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't move from this spot&quot; Clarence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't either&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Goldwin tried moving the both of you but with no success.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well none of you can be moved&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
Ron's hands and feet slimmed at this point and his fingernails grew longer. &quot;I'm turning into a girl&quot; Ron sobbed finally accepting what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we don't know that for sure&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said though she looked like she didn't believe her own words.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I not be turning into a girl?&quot; Ron asked through his sobs. At this point his face took on a more feminine form. His lips puffed out a bit and his eyebrows became thinner. His nose shrank a bit to form a cute button nose. His cheek bones rose a little higher on his face while his skin seemed to become softer and glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a strange&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Ron asked through his sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;It may be a temporary thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be a girl&quot; Ron sobs. As he says this his hips widen and his waist narrows. &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know but we'll figure it out&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;Perhaps the answer lies in what you were doing before the transformation started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just talking to Clarence when he said that I should look in a mirror&quot; Ron sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't exactly true Mrs. Goldwin&quot; you say. &quot;It is true that Ron was talking to Clarence after he shoved him into the lockers. His exact words were 'Alright 'Claire', let's see your pretty panties'. Then he started changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this true Ron?&quot; Mrs. Goldwin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Ron sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you been bulling Clarence like that for a while?&quot; Mrs. Goldwin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Ron sobbed. As he said this he suddenly grew breasts to a b cup size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clarence, do you have any idea why this is happening?&quot; Mrs. Goldwin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had often hoped that those who bullied me would be taught a lesson&quot; Clarence said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like that lesson is being taught now&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does indeed&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;I'm going to have to call your parents and let them know what's happening Ron.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ron just continued sobbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at it like this Ron&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said. &quot;If this is a lesson you might transform back if you learn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think so?&quot; Ron asked through his sobs. Just then the final remains of his male self changed. His balls were pulled into his body as his penis thinned and shrank. The hole at the tip closed up as his penis finished transforming into a clitoris. His ball sack formed vaginal lips and they, along with his new clit, moved down a bit between his legs. Even though no one could see it a womb grew and his balls became ovaries. Ron was now completely female as if he had<br />
been born one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it looks like your transformation is over though you're still naked&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said.<br />
<br />
As she said that though clothes began to appear on Ron. First a pair of pink panties with the word 'Hottie' in red, orange, and yellow flames appeared. Next a white lace bra appeared on Ron followed by a white blouse. A pink skirt appeared next. A pair of ankle length white nylons and black Mary Jane strap on shoes appeared on his feet. The shoes had a little heel to them which threw Ron off balance as they appeared. He would have landed on his butt if Mrs. Goldwin<br />
hadn't caught him. A pink head band appeared on his head next along with a few rings and bracelets on his left hand and wrist. Some light blush appeared on his cheeks as eye shadow, mascara, and lipstick appeared on his eyes and lips. A pink silk scarf appeared around his neck and dangling earrings with a trio of heart shaped Tourmalines on the end of them while pink nail polish with red hearts appeared<br />
on his finger nails. Finally a cream colored purse appeared hanging from his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I must say that you became a very lovely girl Ron&quot; Mrs. Goldwin said trying to cheer him up. &quot;You should be able to move now since the transformation is finished. I want you to come to my office. Clarence, Claire, I want you two to come to my office too.&quot;<br />
<br />
So off to the principle's office they went.</p>
