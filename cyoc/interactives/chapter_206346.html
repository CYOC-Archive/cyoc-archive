<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was almost done with his peas and carrots when he heard a vehicle pull into the driveway.<br />
<br />
It was the farmer and his wife! They were back early! Still naked, Paul rushed up to throw on whatever clothes he could find in his room. Racing back down, Paul opened the door and greeted the returning farmer and his wife. &quot;Hello! Welcome home. I wasn&#39;t expecting you back for a few more days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, well the weather in Florida sucked, so we decided to come back a little early.&quot; A kind, but stern voice replied. It belonged to Bill, the farmer whose property Paul had been taking care of. &quot;I hope it&#39;s not too much trouble.&quot; Bill shook Paul&#39;s hand and even with his newly enhanced strength, Paul felt weak in comparison to the the burly farmer. Bill returned to his truck to help his wife unload while Paul quickly packed up his things and prepared to leave.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for before Paul was ready to head out.Paul quickly updated Bill on the overall status of the farm and Bill paid him for his efforts. Soon enough Paul was on his way and Bill and his wife, Connie, settled back into their home.<br />
<br />
Connie was in her early 30&#39;s; she had dark brown hair and moderately sizeable boobs that she would tease he husband with whenever she knew nobody else was looking. Her body was toned from working on the farm for so many years. If Connie was supple and limber then Bill was big and strong. Bill stood over six feet tall, with legs the size of tree trunks and arms like steel cables. Striking such and imposing figure it was hard to believe how sweet and kindhearted he was.<br />
<br />
The next morning Bill got up bright and early. It was time to milk the cows; the first of many chores he needed to do that day. Unknown to him, the milk his cows produced was no longer normal, ordinary milk. The cows had eaten the hay Paul&#39;s blood had tainted the previous day. After being digested, the virus had infected the cows and began to mutate. While not affecting the cow&#39;s physical forms, the virus had changed and multiplied in their udders.<br />
<br />
Bill set about milking the herd and he could tell that they appreciated it. After he was done, Bill sent the milk to the pasteurizer like he always did. Connie meanwhile was about to make breakfast and needed milk for the meal. Without knowing any better, she went out and retrieved some from the pasteurizer; but since Bill had only just filled it, the milk inside had not been properly processed. Unknown to her, all the milk she had just acquired was laced with the life changing transformative virus.<br />
<br />
Connie cooked up a tasty meal consisting of eggs, bacon, french toast, hash browns, and to wash it all down, fresh milk of course! Bill struck up conversation as they both sat down to eat. &quot;You know, I was thinking we could take the horses out for a ride after I finish the chores this afternoon. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds nice Honey.&quot; Connie replied. &quot;After having to cut our vacation short it would be nice to have some fun, even if it is just here on the farm.&quot; The pair continued to chat over their breakfast, completely unaware of the changes about to wash over their bodies. The virus was hard at work rewriting Bill and Connie&#39;s genome, and by the end of their meal, both had begun to feel hot and rather aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow,&quot; Bill started. Bill could hear the blood pumping through his veins and felt very uncomfortable. His stomach churned and the last thing he wanted to do was regurgitate his wife&#39;s cooking right in front of her. &quot;That was a wonderful breakfast Connie. I&#39;d better head back out to the barn though; the animals aren&#39;t going to feed themselves.&quot; Bill got up quickly and headed for the door. He did his best to hide his blushing face, and he could feel his cock beginning to twitch and stiffen.<br />
<br />
He need not have worried though because Connie was barely listening as her own face flushed from heat and a sudden onset of lasciviousness. &quot;Ooo... Don&#39;t mention it.&quot; She almost whispered in response; doing her best to gather up dishes and pretend nothing was wrong.<br />
<br />
The latch on the door clicked, advertising Bill&#39;s departure from the house. &quot;Finally!&quot; Connie exclaimed as she dumped the dishes and ran to the hallway mirror. &#39;What is going on?!&#39; She thought to herself. Connie felt like she was on fire. Every square inch of her skin picked and pricked in twangs of discomfort. Her body was flushed, and to top it all off sweat was beginning to pour out of her skin. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; She cried out. A million thoughts ran through Connie&#39;s head trying to make sense of the situation. &#39;Did I not cook the eggs long enough? Maybe I picked up a bug on vacation?&#39; as her mind raced, Connie stood in the hallway shaking and hyperventilating. Slowly pressure began to build up in her forehead, hands, and feet. &quot;Mhrr... Agh!&quot; She groaned to herself. &quot;It&#39;s getting worse!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pressure and heat became too much for her and she let out a small pitiful whimper. &quot;What is happening?&quot; She asked aloud. As if in answer, twin points of pressure on her forehead erupted into small bone nubs from beneath her skin. Connie&#39;s mouth fell open as she saw her tiny horns in the mirror. Ignoring the pressure in her hands and feet, Connie reached up to touch the burgeoning protrusions. They were solid, firmly attached to her head and growing. Even in the few seconds she had been touching them they had extended an inch and a half. Connie was unable to focus on her horns much longer though because her hands seemed to seize up. Overwhelming pressure pushed and molded them into a foreign shape. Connie&#39;s fingers merged and enlarged leaving her with only two fingers and a thumb on each. Her nails turned into thick calcified sheets, not dissimilar from the hooves of a cow. Connie watched her beastly hands while she flexed and clenched them; her now larger and stronger tendons and bones shifting and undulating under her taut skin. Watching in terrified silence, Connie could feel a familiar pressure building in her feet and rushed to kick off her shoes.<br />
<br />
SHRICK<br />
<br />
Too late! Thick sturdy cloven hooves ripped out the front of Connie&#39;s shoes. Her posture shifted to accommodate her changing legs. Connie&#39;s ankles stretched upwards forcing her to stand on what used to be her tip-toes. Her new hooves clipped and clopped on the hard wood floor as Connie tried to make sense of what she was seeing and feeling. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; she gasped as a new sensation, like hundreds of tiny bug bites, assaulted her skin. &quot;A cow?&quot; Connie questioned as she finally realized what her changes reminder her of. &quot;I&#39;m turning into a cow!&quot; Blotchy black and white fur burst out of her skin; racing across her body in a wave. &quot;BILL! Help me!&quot; Connie screamed at the top of her lungs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Bill had only made it half way to the barn before the pressure in his head, hands and feet exploded into pain. He fell over in a heap as strange sensations overwhelmed him. By the time he knew what was happening his feet had turned into bovine hooves and split through his boots. His hands had lost two fingers and he had grown large horns on his head. &quot;What the...?&quot; Bill muttered under his breath. The heat and pressure from his changes was slowly moving toward his groin, and more specifically his balls.<br />
<br />
Bill quickly pulled his pants down to inspect his tingling sack. With his pants out of the way, Bill saw that his average sized gonads were not only much larger, but getting darker too. Bill stood on his new ungulate legs watching; stunned. As his balls finished enlarging, the change seemed to move slightly upward to his already immense cock. Springing to attention, Bill&#39;s dick grew bigger and bigger. Bill couldn&#39;t help getting hard as the changes washed over his privates. &quot;Mmmh...&quot; Bill groaned, it just felt so good. When he looked down again he saw that his tool had taken on a mottled pattern, mixing the darker skin of his ball sack with the lighter skin of his abdomen. After it reached a foot and half long, Bill couldn&#39;t resist grasping it in his huge beastly hands. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; Bill called out as lust began to fill his mind. He stroked his mammoth cock as pins and needles rushed across his skin. The pleasure from teasing his dick took his mind off of the agony of short black fur pouring out of his skin. It was thick, and soon it covered his whole body. Using his free hand, Bill stoked his fur covered chest. Bill smiled, maybe it was just part of the changes, but he was really starting to like it. Bill&#39;s growing ears picked up as a cry suddenly cut through the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill! Help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Connie, and she was in trouble. Putting his new muscles to the test, Bill raced back to the house. His giant hooved legs pounded the earth as he bolted back towards the house; tearing and shredding any clothes that had made it through his initial changes.<br />
<br />
Connie gasped as the door flew open. Instead of her tall, strong, loving husband, however, A giant hulking, fur covered, bull man barged through the door. Connie managed to recognize her husband&#39;s face just before it pushed out into a long bovine snout. &quot;Oh Bill! it&#39;s you. what is happen...&quot; Connie paused as Bill&#39;s strong musk wafted into her nose. &quot;...ing?&quot; She trailed off. Connie&#39;s nostrils flared, welcoming in as much of Bill&#39;s pheromones as they could. Connie&#39;s eyes soaked in her husbands changes, and eventually came to rest on the massive mottled dick between his legs. &quot;Mmmm...&quot; Connie&#39;s libido kicked into overdrive; her own body racing to catch up with her husbands changes. Connie&#39;s fur covered her pale skin, but it couldn&#39;t hide the swelling muscle underneath. Connie took Bill&#39;s hefty hoof like hands and placed them on her swelling boobs. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I bet you&#39;ll appreciate this.&quot; Connie purred as her bosom ballooned out. Squeezing and pinching her growing boobs with his beefy hands, Bill felt himself get even more hard than before, if that was possible. Connie&#39;s breasts slowed their growth when they reached the size of Connie&#39;s head. &quot;I can see a few things I think I appreciate as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me so well.&quot; Bill spoke but his voice now had a much lower timber. He kneaded Connie&#39;s breasts as he tried desperately to think clearly. &quot;Connie, we need figure this out.&quot; Bill started again, shaking his head. &quot;Why are we turning into cows? How do we stop this? Shouldn&#39;t we be worried?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh...&quot; Connie moaned as her face began to swell and push out into a snout like her husband&#39;s. She stroked Bill&#39;s rock hard cock with one hand while the other searched for her own sex. &quot;The... mmMm... only thing I&#39;m worried about is... Mmmoo... Mmmooaa... is THIS DICK! MOOO!&quot; Connie bellowed between increasingly bovine moans. The whole time she had been stroking Bill&#39;s beastly tool while she searched in vain for her own snatch. Getting increasingly frustrated with not being able to find it, Connie had completely missed the large, growing sack of tender pink flesh that had grown over it. The sack was getting bigger by the moment and soon four long teats pushed their way out of it. Connie&#39;s udder kept growing until it was the size of a pumpkin. &quot;Mmmooah! Help me Bill!&quot; Connie moaned as her hand moved around frantically; still unable to find its mark. &quot;I need you... mmMoh... inside MmoooOOO!&quot; She bellowed desperately.<br />
<br />
Bill could see the carnal need burning in his wife&#39;s eyes and could feel his own lust building quickly. Connie&#39;s solid hand on his member coaxed him to forget any hesitation he had, and he quickly gave in to his developing instincts. &quot;Don&#39;t worry babe,&quot; Bill grunted. &quot;I nngn... KnnoOow... just what you need!&quot; Deep in his mind Bill was surprised by his new inclination to try and moo vocally, but he repressed the thought as best he could and carried on.<br />
<br />
Taking the lead, Bill guided Connie into a position where she could bend forward and lean against the wall. He held her there for a moment while he tickled her dripping pussy with his rigid, bestial, cock. From this position Bill knew Connie&#39;s immense udder wouldn&#39;t get in the way. He also noticed a small tail pushing out from his lovers backside. Bill pressed Connie completely against the wall before whispering into her bovine ears: &quot;Is this...&quot; He bucked his hips sending his dick slapping against Connie&#39;s cow-like body. &quot;...What you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOooh!&quot; Connie moaned in ecstasy. &quot;Yes! Fuck me Bill! Fill me up with your beastly toooOOOoool!&quot; She moo&#39;d louder than ever before as Bill penetrated her sopping folds. Connie readjusted her grip on the wall as Bill began to pound into her rythmicly. Connie&#39;s large udder and fur covered breasts bounced and swayed in time with her husbands thrusting. Her eyes closed tight as the first waves of an earth shattering orgasm began to roll over her. Pressure built then released as her small nub of a tail exploded into a full fledged cow tail. Her horns finished growing, and pulses of euphoria surged through her body with every thrust of her husband&#39;s dick. If anyone had been watching, they would&#39;ve been able to see thick cords of muscle rippling, and multiplying underneath Connie&#39;s coarse fur as Bill&#39;s pounding kept her locked in orgasmic bliss.<br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s own changes were close to finishing as well. A sturdy tapered tail with a tuft of longer fur at the end now adorned his hindquarters, his face now akin to a long bovine snout and, like Connie, Bill was using his extra long tongue to pant in exhaustion. With one final thrust, Bill went over the edge and launched his seed into his transformed wife. His climax seemed to last forever, pumping bucket after bucket of cum into Connie; but eventually it was over. Bill stood for a moment in the afterglow; his gargantuan dick still pinning Connie in a bent over position against the wall. Connie had her eyes closed still shuddering in the aftershock of their incredible love making. One of her hands idly played with one of the teats on her new udder, while the other helped brace herself against the wall. Bill slowly slid out of Connie. Her new tail flicked happily behind her as she moo&#39;d softly in pleasure.</p>
