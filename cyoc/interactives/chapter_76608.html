<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Modesty King opened up the last box with a little sigh. She was almost done unpacking her things in her new room. Of course being a 
freshmen and this being university she was in the dorms and had a couple of roommates. She hadn't met them yet as they were still in 
class which was good. She had wanted to unpack herself and write in her new diary with no one else around. It didn't take long for her to 
finish and sitting on her bed she opened her diary and began writing.</p>
<p><I>Dear Diary,</p>
<p>Well here I am at university finally after graduating high school twenty years ago. I know that seems strange since I look like I'm 18 but 
that's because I was transformed. I wasn't even born a girl. Perhaps I should explain. You see I originally came here looking for a security 
job. However Ms. Whiteleaf thought I could do better as a student. You see some freshmen students, most of them girls and all minorities, 
have gone missing. Ms. Whiteleaf thinks they're being transformed and is afraid that they're being killed or destroyed once transformed. 
Now there's nothing wrong with them being transformed and since this is Transformation U it's kind of encouraged. However there are 
rules to protect the students and one of them is to tag anyone that's turned into a food animal so they're not slaughtered.</p>
<p>I'm pretty scared even though Ms. Whiteleaf put some protections on me that will save me if I should die. I don't know if I'll disappear 
or not but the chances are pretty good. Ms. Whiteleaf thinks that it's a white supremacy group that's causing the disappearances which is 
why she transformed me into what I am now. I went from being a 39 year old white man to an 18 year old black girl. I'm actually glad that I 
was transformed into a girl and as for being black it's basically just skin color as far as I'm concerned. Though I know there are those that 
think otherwise. I also like my hair now. It's long with a slight natural wave to it. And my breasts are a nice B cup though I know many boys 
will try to enhance them to absurd proportions. Oh and remind me not to eat the cafeteria food.</p>
<p>Now on to my roommates. Their name's are Amanda White and Christina Holmes. Apparently both of them are white and one of the 
girls that have gone missing was their roommate before me. I don't know if I should be worried about that little fact or not. It could be 
possible that they are white supremacists and have something to do with the disappearances though I can't say if that's the case. I'll 
probably be able to tell once I meet them. I don't know what they think a black person is supposed to be like but I'm not going to be a 
stereotypical black girl. You see too much of that in the news from the so called "leaders" of the black community. They make it seem like 
all blacks are victims of whites so anything they do is forgiven. They're expected to be dumb gang bangers which I find really offensive. 
I've seen the way a few people have looked at a black person they haven't met before and I didn't like it. I hope I don't get that kind of look 
when I meet my roommates. I don't know what I'll do if that happens but I guess I'll cross that bridge if I come to it.</p>
<p>I'm glad that Ms. Whiteleaf gave you to me. Ms. Whiteleaf is the only one I'd be able to talk to but I have to be careful with that so I 
don't arouse anyone's suspicions. At least I can put my thoughts down in you where they'll be safe. Ms. Whiteleaf has told me that you 
have a spell on you that will turn anyone, other than myself of course, who tries to read you into a stone statue. This even applies if they 
try to read what I'm writing in you as I'm writing. It would be interesting to see the change but I hope no one tries to read you. There are 
some things a girl wants to keep private.</p>
<p>Well I can see that my roommates' class has ended so they should be here anytime now if they come straight here. So I have to put 
you up for now. TTYL. Oh that stands for Talk To You Later.</p></I>
<p>Modesty closed her diary and put it in the nightstand by her bed. She was hoping that her roommates would welcome her and not be 
white supremacists like she feared. The only reason why Ms. Whiteleaf told her that her roommates were white was that she had a 
suspicion that they were white supremacists. That didn't give her a good feeling though Ms. Whiteleaf might have been wrong. But what if 
she had other evidence to suggest that? Modesty could be in serious danger even if she could be saved from death. Of course that 
protection only came into effect if she died. She shuddered as she thought of all the things that could happen to her without her dying.</p>
<p>She turned to the door when she heard the knob turning. Now she would see what would happen.</p></p>
