<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Up until this point, there hadn&#39;t been much history of childbirth within the park. A litter of panther kittens, a few deer, perhaps two or three others. In the interest of promoting these forms as a permanent lifestyle, the park had a very generous policy in place when it came to pregnancies and supporting recent mothers. That infrastructure really wasn&#39;t prepared to handle the demands of the number of swelling bellies currently scattered about however, and there was a fair deal of concern what everyone would do when all these does went into labor at once.<br />
<br />
The first of the park&#39;s expectant mothers to go into labor was Mark, although nobody realized it at the time. With a minimum of fuss, she laid her half dozen eggs in the middle of the night. They were only discovered the next day, when she refused to move, and kept calling for Tran. Having been absolved of all charges in light of his extremely helpful tips, and lack of any real firsthand involvement in the shadier side of things, Tran had been monitoring Mark quite closely all throughout, but after she laid her eggs, he made the somewhat surprising request to be transformed again. The males of the species of bird he&#39;d primarily modeled their forms on played a very active roll in tending to the eggs, and in her impaired mental state, Mark was unwilling to let him approach otherwise. As he took his turns warming the eggs, he considered how all this might play out in the long term. Mark had been personally responsible for quite the number of human rights violations at the offsite facility, but this odd little bird woman sincerely didn&#39;t seem to Tran to possess enough of the scientist&#39;s personality, cognitive ability, and perhaps even memories to really stand trial for any of that. He felt guilty enough for his hand in that. Perhaps he could make up for it somehow.<br />
<br />
The eggs hatched after a few weeks, or at least, the eggs were ready to hatch. True birds, and most reptiles, developed either a big or specialized tooth to make their way out of their shells, but these baby harpies needed a bit of extra help from the outside. Feeding them proved rather awkward as well. It seemed Mark was capable of breast feeding, but with no arms to hold her children, there was a bit of awkward crouching involved.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Next of course was Terry, whose pregnancy had actually begun quite some time before she&#39;d stopped taking the berries. They weren&#39;t 100% effective after all, and she certainly hadn&#39;t been shy about rolling the dice as often as possible over the course of her stay. The situation was a bit delicate though. With how emotionally fragile she was at the best of times, she was allowed to give birth within the warren, and transformed back only after making a full physical recovery. After catching wind that she was to be sent home, she made quite the effort to get started on a second litter, but Tim had the good sense to intervene. He also promised to do his part in seeing the children had a proper upbringing, going so far as to offer to help raise them alongside Terry... although he did seem rather alarmed at the realization that there were five babies in the litter, and that turning them human was not an option. When the time finally did come to escort Terry from the park, her panic attack was almost as severe as when &quot;the Lone Wolf&quot; had terrorized her what seemed like a lifetime ago. After the chamber had worked its magic, the once again human Terry took quite some time to step back out.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Charlotte was the next to become a new mother, although it was becoming clear she wouldn&#39;t be alone in that regard. Mermaids had been designed to be rather fertile, and in addition to the dangers of the open ocean, they had no access to the berries, or any other convenient form of contraception. By the time she was ready to give birth, two of the new arrivals were already visibly with child.<br />
<br />
Naomi was having a difficult time thinking straight as the big day drew closer. Part of her was just entirely too excited for Charlotte, and the children, her children, she was on the verge of giving birth to. But at the same time, seeing her belly swell, and feeling the kicking... or, the flopping in any case, of the unborn children within was giving her maternal pangs as well. She&#39;d been slowly flirting with the idea of giving this whole heterosexual sex thing a try, and she&#39;d also been doing a bit of flirting with the only merman in existence. Finally, just a few days before Charlotte gave birth, she&#39;d taken the plunge, and she was fairly ashamed at just how much she enjoyed it. If you&#39;d asked her a few months ago, she&#39;d proudly say she would never in a million years make love to a man. She still considered them to be completely inferior, but now she really couldn&#39;t claim the world would be better off without them. Charlotte knew how to have a bit of fun in the bedroom, but nothing she did could really compare to the feeling of Justin&#39;s thick, flexible manhood just... twisting around inside her, helping to hold her up against him. It was, of course, purely a physical thing. Nothing would ever come between her and the true love of her life. But... what an incredibly powerful physical thing it was.<br />
<br />
Once Charlotte actually delivered though, none of the merfolk had much time to enjoy themselves. There were three children in all, all of them girls, and all of them born swimming. No one had really considered the logistics before it was too late, but baby mermaids were a fair bit more of a handful than human babies. There was no putting them down in a crib to get a moment&#39;s rest. They could swim off in any direction at any time, and there were plenty of dangerous places they could find themselves. If not for the new arrivals, they&#39;d almost certainly have lost at least one baby to disaster within the first few days. It took just about the entire population of their new little social circle to keep a proper eye on the little swimmers. It was a bit worrying to think that in another few months, there&#39;d be around three times as many to handle...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The main event though was when the does came due. The park had a proper delivery room, but it was only good for one mother at a time. Several of the does had left the park entirely, and had access to proper hospitals. Those who stayed in the park however largely had to make due with open fields. When the time drew near, the park brought in trained midwives, sending them out with husky escorts to address the sudden population explosion as well as they could. As it happened, Sam and Goldie were present to keep people clear when Cheryl went into labor. Watching the little child-fawns come into the world, Goldie squeezed Sam&#39;s hand, whispering in his ear, &quot;Do you think... someday?&quot; before getting too embarrassed to finish her thought.<br />
<br />
Brian meanwhile was doing his best to be a supportive &quot;husband.&quot; It was a huge relief for him to see the look on Cheryl&#39;s face as her babies were passed to her. It seemed like the responsibilities of motherhood were finally putting some thoughts in her head that didn&#39;t center on pleasing a man. Taking care of new lives might actually be the best thing for her, Brian realized. Empathy, selflessness, concern for others&#39; well-being. These certainly weren&#39;t traits she&#39;d seemed to possess as Chad. Pamela meanwhile just looked horrified at how much pain was involved in giving birth. She was of course due to go into labor any time now herself.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Of course, the does weren&#39;t the only ones to recently find themselves with the sort of &quot;enhanced femininity&quot; that left them pregnant the day they last came out of the chambers. Irene would be joining them shortly, and there was a fair bit of concern from her doctors about how her unborn child&#39;s wings would complicate the process. But that was hardly her only problem...</p>
