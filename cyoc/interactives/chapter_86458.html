<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan picked out a pair of steel-toed work boots. They were size 13, a little big for him, but he felt compelled to try them on. If they were guaranteed to fit, the sizing wouldn&#39;t really matter, right? He unlaced them and put his feet in. They were clearly too big. &quot;Ugh, guaranteed to fit, my ass.&quot; he said. He decided he was gonna try them all the way on before he talked to a clerk. He tied them up on his feet, and stood up. He walked around the change room, the spacing in his shoes obvious. Annoyed, he sat back down and started unlacing the shoes. He pulled them off, and grabbed his own shoes. He tried to slip on the right shoe, but it just wouldn&#39;t fit, it seemed way to small. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; asked Ryan, to himself, as he flipped the tongue on his trainers to check the size. It said 9, same as before. He looked down at his feet, and saw that they looked different. Bigger, almost. He wiggled his toes, they didn&#39;t feel any different. He grabbed the work boots again and slid them on. They fit perfectly this time. Ryan was super confused, he walked over to the mirror.<br />
<br />
He looked the same as ever, mostly. Blue tee shirt, brown shorts, and now a pair or brown work boots on his seemingly bigger feet. He looked down at his feet, he felt like they were different, but he couldn&#39;t place his finger on it. As he looked, his toes felt itchy. The sensation started to work up his foot, as a pair of wool socks sprouted out of the boots, extending to just below his calf. Ryan bent down and started to scratch under the sock, as he felt hair under the woolly material. A dense forest of black hair started to spread up his legs, giving him a furry appearance. His legs started to burn, as they got stronger. It felt like he was undergoing a very intense workout. As they thickened, his shorts started to grow down his legs and change from brown to blue, with various stains down the legs. A belt wrapped around his waist, with a buckle on the front.<br />
<br />
The change continued to work up his body, as Ryan&#39;s stomach and chest started to gain definition. Ryan almost doubled over in pain as his stomach shaped itself into a 6 pack abs and his chest formed a pair of spectacular pecs. The tee shirt he was wearing started to fade to white, and the sleeves receded to nothing. The collar widened as his tee shirt became a dirty wife beater. Black hairs started to poke out of his chest, and when Ryan lifted the shirt some, he could see his body was covered in the black hairs just like his legs. He raised an arm, as he watched his armpit hair twist and multiply, giving him a bush of hair under there. His arms started to beef up while the little black hairs formed on them too, and his hands became bigger, calloused and weathered, from use.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s head felt heavy for a second, as his neck started to fill out. He watched as he developed what could only be called a bull neck. He watched in the mirror as black stubble poked through his face and became a goatee around his mouth, connecting to the hair on his head. The hair on his head darkened, becoming black, as it receded some in the front and grew to his shoulders in the back. He shook his head, as his mousy hair took on a wavy style. His skin took on a deeper tan, like someone who would be out in the sun every day, and it became more weathered and tough.<br />
<br />
Ryan looked down at the ground, seeing a pair of size 9 trainers there. What the hell was he thinking? His big feet definitely wouldn&#39;t fit into those. He grabbed his flannel jacket off the bench and put it on, grabbing a cigarette and a lighter out of his pocket. He left the trainers in the change room and left the building, lighting up a smoke on the way to the construction site.</p>
