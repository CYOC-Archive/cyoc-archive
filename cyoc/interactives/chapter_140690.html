<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad waited. He glanced across the street where Bruiser lingered.  He thought, &quot;Maybe, if the spa is closed? We can start our date early...&quot; Chad bit his lip, and smiled at Bruiser. He pulled out his invitation for the free spa treatment,  glanced at it, and rang the bell again.<br />
<br />
The door suddenly flew open.  A long wiry black haired bald man opened the door. Chad looked down on the man who seemed to be intently staring a Chad&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes? Ah, you have a coupon, how lucky for you! Come in, come in,&quot; said the little troll of a man. He grabbed Chad&#39;s arm with one claw like hand (the dude had seriously long nails, which stung Chad&#39;s arm through his green suit coat and shirt). For a little old guy, he was strong, for a moment as he guided Chad into the darkened spa, Chad was lifted off the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re closed?&quot; Chad said as he blinked in the darkness, as the door shut behind him. The lobby was windowless,  and the only light came from a single candle on a counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense!&quot; shouted the little man, then softly, he said, &quot;of course, we are open.  Let me take that coupon, and we will get you cleaned up.&quot; He snatched the coupon from Chad&#39;s hand. <br />
<br />
Chad was relieved.  The little man must&#39;ve been staring at the coupon, which Chad had held near his crotch. He had enjoyed Bruiser stealing glances at his crotch, but thinking that this guy was staring unsettled him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just showered,&quot; Chad replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Showered? Nah,nah. A cleansing bath is needed. Come, you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pushed Chad forward in the dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are your lights not working?&quot; Chad asked as he moved toward the dimly lit doorway by candlelight. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? No. Candlelight is more relaxing, your eyes will adjust.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pushed Chad through the hallway, a d guided Chad down the dark hallway.  Chad felt a clawed hand pull him to a stop. He heard a doorknob turn. He glanced toward the hairy little man in the dark. He saw two glowing yellow eyes. The door next to him opened. Light streamed out. So did heat, followed by heavy incense. The man was just a man, his eyes weren&#39;t yellow.<br />
<br />
&quot;In, in, in!&quot; Said the man pushing him.<br />
<br />
The room had an enormous stone tub with wooden steps leading up to a platform next to it. The room was entirely lit by candles. Perhaps thirty or more scattered throughout the relatively small room. It had no windows or other doors that Chad could see.<br />
<br />
Chad started to sweat. The room wasn&#39;t just warm, it was hot. The man guided Chad up the steps to the platform. On the platform was a cane back chair and a cane hat rack.  The claws moved lightning fast. Chad felt them scrape across his bare skin. He was naked sitting on the chair. Each hook on the nearby hatrack held an article of his clothing. One hook for his jacket, one for his shirt, one for his trousers, one for his underwear,  one for each sock, one for each shoe, one for his belt, and one for his watch. He thought it only had four hooks when he first saw it, but obviously it had more. His eyes seemed to be adapting to the light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Into bath now. Soak.&quot; The little man pointed at the rectangular cistern filled slimy green herbs.<br />
<br />
Chad stared and hesitated.  It seemed like a bad idea. The shape reminded him of a stone sarcophagus.  The herb bath looked like a disgusting swamp. The litte man thrust a bowl shaped cup in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink!&quot; said he, &quot;hydrate!&quot;<br />
<br />
It smelled like spiced cider, and as he was sweating, he welcomed the drink. It was cool and refreshing. Chad noticed the odd little man wasn&#39;t sweating even though he seemed to be wearing a black wool robe. Chad wondered briefly if the guy was a monk. Then he stopped wondering for a minute or five. He seemed to have lost a few minutes.  When next he was aware, he was thigh deep in the green slime. His mushroom tip was completely submerged in the liquid, which was odd because his penis was fully erect, but pointing straight down. His reflection in the shiny green gunk was amazing. He looked bigger, buffer, his cock looked longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lie down,&quot; ordered the little man pushing Chad sidewise. There was a tilted plank submerged in the liquid. Chad climbed on it. Now he was lying at an angle with his neck and head sticking out of the herbal goo. It was so warm and soothing. He felt he could lie there forever. <br />
<br />
The little man beamed down at Chad,  then he clapped his hands and shouted, &quot;Hermes! Dionysus!&quot;<br />
<br />
Out of the shadows two candles moved forward they were carried by two hugely muscled guys with thin glittery gauze ribbons of cloth wrapped around their waists and covering their hairless crotches. The material was so transparent,  Chad could make out veins and wrinkles on their shaved cocks. When did he become a cock watcher? 4 PM this afternoon,  he reminded himself with a smile. His attention returned to Hermes and Dionysus.  They were totally buff and totally hairless. Heads shaved, pits, pubes, arms and legs shaved,  chest shaved - hell they didn&#39;t even have eyebrows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wax,&quot; said the small man behind them. <br />
<br />
Each held a large candle over Chad&#39;s head. They tilted them. He felt the hot wax fill his ears, plugging and sealing them up. He didn&#39;t flinch or speak. He became acutely aware of the silence. Moments before the wax filled his ears, the room had been abuzz with flickering candles, creaking platform and more. Now there was only silence.  Each giant reached for his eyes, and using only an index finger gently closed an eye. As soon as the eyes shut, hot wax dripped down sealing them shut too.<br />
<br />
Sensory deprivation tank, thought Chad.  He&#39;d heard of them before,  but no one mentioned the hot wax or slime. Still it was relaxing  <br />
<br />
Next his lips were sealed.<br />
<br />
He thought to himself, guess they don&#39;t want me to talk.<br />
<br />
A tube was shoved in each nostril. Hot wax sealed them in place. Chad imagined what his face looked like covered in wax with long straws sticking out of his nose.<br />
<br />
He felt the plank move beneath him. He imagined gears and a crank creaking and squeaking, but heard only silence. The heavy liquid covered his face. His body was relaxed and unmoving. He tried to move his arm, but it just lay numbly at his side. His feet had been 3 feet below the surface. Now his head and shoulders were level with his feet. Chad felt the plank beneath him descend. He was floating in the tank three feet below the surface. In total silence. The air through the tubes was fresh and untainted by the heavy incense. Chad was thinking clearly,  but now he was questioning his actions. He felt so helpless, but that feeling felt good. Weren&#39;t sensory deprivation tanks supposed to simulate the womb? Be symbolic of rebirth? <br />
<br />
Chad could not deny his feelings for Bruiser. He desperately wanted to bury his naked self in his powerful teammate&#39;s naked muscles. He had known Bruiser since preschool when Bruiser was called Billy. Chad liked calling him William better.  Somehow the suit changed  Chad.  Bruiser- William and Chad had wrestled, showered and dressed together,  and nothing had happened between them. The suit changed that. The suit? The secret admirer! It couldn&#39;t be William,  could it? Who was it? Why did he want Chad this way? Who was the troll? Why didn&#39;t he sweat? Did he unbutton Chad&#39;s shirt or shred it with his claws? Chad seemed to have an impression of green buttons flying across the room and clattering on the wood and stone floors. He was thinking clearly. He was worried. He was helplessly immobile.  He farted. Warm bubbles of gas raced across his butt and back, between his thighs, and up his sides. He started to slowly sink. He kept sinking. How long were those air tubes?</p>
