<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin was about ready to make the spell into an incantation and feel the power he hoped was held within the pages of this book. Lucky, but as he said the first word the phone began to ring.<br />
<br />
A grab for the phone out of an instinctive act brought the sound of a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin, this is Master Bogo De'Jure and I have that transformational spell curse ready for your enjoyment!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin's memory of this sham was to say the least was not good. The Master' had tried before to cast a spell on the one personage Kevin wanted to be changed from human to a Shetland Pony Stallion. He had asked before and others tried to do there Wicca best but none had the power to accomplish the task. Yet just the hearing of the Master's name drew up visions of some money grubbing jerk doing his damnedest to weasel money out of those who would seek true people of power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your too late I have in my possession the &quot;Book of Black Spells&quot; so I don't need any of your Wicca hocus pokus!&quot; said Kevin showing his disgust for this so called Master of the Wicca religion.<br />
<br />
Angered words flew in both directions till Kevin made the blunder and spilled the beans. &quot;Look if you must know the victim of my spell was me! I for decades have longed to be other than this weak human and feel the strength and renewed self to become a Shetland stallion. You are weaker in your powers than I, and now I have the book! I have the power and maybe as I learn the book and it's ways you shall feel the joy of being a mare for me to fuck over as you keep trying to do to me!&quot; argued Kevin.<br />
<br />
A roar of strange words flew from the Master's mouth as Kevin hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
Now after this confrontation Kevin was feeling hot under the collar. He got up and walking to the sun porch he began to open windows. The fresh country breeze of Central Wisconsin flowed through the porch and swirled about the living room.<br />
<br />
Who can say if the Wicca Master did or did not have any power as the stiff breeze did Kevin an injustice which he's have to learn to live with for a long time to come. As Kevin removed his clothes and donned a bath robe the breeze flipped page after page of the Spell book as it laid on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
At last Kevin was cooled down and returned to the reading of his spell with a mug of fresh cool water. The Book laid open and Kevin not thinking to check sat down on the couch and peered over the incantation he was about to give a try.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, lets try this!&quot; as Kevin's tongue strained to pronounce the Latin words he filled in the open spaces with his name, the time, the place and finally the description of what he wanted most. &quot;A Shetland stallions penis to feel and enjoy! To be and know the joy of strength and stamina! To be part of the real sexual act between my stallion's cock and the mare chosen to mount! I Kevin L. Rooste for one week.................................., ugg!&quot; as Kevin was halted he felt so very strange.<br />
<br />
A spasm of uncontrolled shuddering of his head body and legs sent him into a feeling of extreme terror. He tried to stammer out the words to finish his spell but as the spasm increased in severity he was captured by the moment.<br />
<br />
He found his eyes slammed shut and then released moments later. This happened again and again as he watched his skin changing color to that of a charcoal black. Kevin feet felt as if they were swelling and peering down when his eyes were opened he indeed saw they were looking like basket balls.<br />
<br />
Kevin tried to reach for his swollen feet but found his arms would not work. As he struggled for control against the horrid feeling of helplessness he gazed to the Spell book open on the table. The print was glowing a Sharpe tone of red as the scent in the air seemed to be of burning sulfur.<br />
<br />
Breathing seemed to make his very chest and neck stiffen and give waves of sensual pleasure feelings. A yawn which lasted for more than a minute made his mouth feel soft and loose with a strange acrid taste of salt.<br />
<br />
I peering gaze toward those swollen feet saw them to look as if they had swollen beyond basket ball size and were three times that heading to Chinese basket ball's in size.<br />
<br />
Now both legs and arms seemed useless as Kevin tried to sit up on the couch. A quick look to the Spell book saw it's red lettering dulling and cooling down as the spell finished it's curse.<br />
<br />
Kevin could feel a dullness over the length of his entire body. Inching himself to the edge of the couch he took a deep breath and tried to stand. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the strange sensual sensation made his back stiffen and with little trouble he stood up. Now standing he tried to walk. His legs were stiff and seemed locked together as he tried to move and had no luck when standing to look down. However he could look upward with strange ease and seemed to find this pose even rather sensual.<br />
<br />
Kevin worked his swollen feet to move with a twisting waddle and began to move toward the bath room and the full length mirror for to see what he looked like. Little by little he worked his way over to the bathroom door. As he twisted his waddle action the silly feeling of sensual thrills pulsed up and down his frame.<br />
<br />
At last he was entering the bathroom, a tired feeling was making him loose the strength to stand up straight. A kink in his midsection made him feel as if the very air was being sucked out of him. Then to help himself over the threshold he urged himself to hop from the carpeted floor to stand on the cold tile of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The hop made his swollen feet slap the cold floor which sent a sharp pain up his body length. Whether it was the urge, the hop, or the resulting pain he felt his body stiffening again and was able to stand and look into the mirror.</p>
