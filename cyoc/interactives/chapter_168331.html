<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I wanna become a girl, but I am not fully sure yet...&quot; you admitted, fairly embarrassed by it, since part of the reason you wanted to was just out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, call me presumptuous, but I had already, and have always expected you to say something like that eventually. You are just like your mother in that reguard.&quot; She smilled at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you were a born a boy? But I guess that could explain a few things.&quot; You exclaimed in shock, only to be lightly thumped on the head. Not that it hurt or anything, but you got the message. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have you know that I have always been a girl thank you very much. From the moment I hatched until this moment. And we will talk later about these &#39;few things&#39;.&quot; She said, in a completely fake tone pretending to be insulted, but you knew she wasn&#39;t, and that she knew that sometimes she was not always the &quot;picture of femininity&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Getting back to my point though, I too for a time, wondered how being a boy would be. Even my parents were not apposed to me becomming one, given my aggresive nature at the time. But no, I knew that one of my purposes in life was that I was meant to bare children for my eventual mate, your Dad. And I do not regret my decision at all. But that is me, not you.&quot; <br />
<br />
After listening to your Mom, you turned to face her properly now. Her short story made a lot of sense to you, but you didn&#39;t have such a strong desire like her to push her in one direction over the other. You must have looked conflicted still because she spoke up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhaaaaaaaa&quot; she sighed. &quot;Listen, the only advice I can give you about this is to try and think about both outcomes, as if you had no say in picking one, and that one was chosen for you. How would you feel about the other option in each outcome? Would you be saddened by not being able to pick the other option? Or would it no longer matter to you now that you were given a direction to follow? If it saddens you, then that may be the true right answer for you. However, if I had to guess, you are not apathetic about both options, and already know your answer, but are just hesitating to accept it for superficial reasons. Am I wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her question was not something you had expected to hear, let alone be able to answer immediately. But that didn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t helpful. You felt that you should try it.<br />
<br />
Closing your eyes, you feel a warm breeze pass over you which makes your body tingle slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now think carefully and really immerse yourself into each choice if you can&quot; instructed your mom. From her voice, you could tell that her head was very close to you. You could even feel her gental breathing flow over you. Its warmth comforting you.<br />
<br />
You begin to picture your future life. How it would turn out, what new things would you do, what interests would change. While it all would be a bit more &quot;ideal&quot; than what would likely happen, you wanted to try it.<br />
<br />
You decided to start with the option where you were changed into a girl. As a girl, your life was relatively easier. You would mainly be learning from your Mom instead of your Dad, but that didn&#39;t bother you in the slightest. You would even be able to help raise your baby brother/sister when they hatched as their older sister. <br />
<br />
Eventually, you would have to find a mate for yourself, and leave the nest. When you found a guy you loved, you would then be tasked to bare his children. That meant getting filled with his semen, and then laying eggs. Depending on your mate, that could mean just 1 or 2 eggs every 10-20 thousand years with a guarentee that a healthy baby would hatch, like your parents. Or you would lay numerous eggs, nearly on a daily rate. But it would be extremely rare that any of them would hatch. You would even still lay when you hadn&#39;t had sex for a while (if that was even possible since your mate&#39;s species would be one where they would constantly be having sex in order to reproduce). Either way, you were really starting to take to the idea of laying eggs. <br />
<br />
Switching gears, you began thinking about remaining a male for life. You would learn about things like how to fight, how to hunt, how to find treasure even so that you could find a mate to bare your children, though that would only be one or 2 every few 10 thousand years given your species. Not that you couldn&#39;t have sex, but it would just stop at that. <br />
<br />
It also meant fighting. In order to claim a mate for yourself, you would either need to settle with someone you didn&#39;t necessarily want, but who were available, or fight for the better options. A third optiin was in existence, but didn&#39;t apply to you unfortunately. It was basically a &quot;mates from birth&quot; kind of deal, where 2 families would set it up with each other to ensure a healthy child and a less violent/risky mating process for the male, and a secured and protected life for the female since their 2 families would be helping them out. These kind of deals though were only between prominent, or large, families though. Not your small, 3-5 member family.<br />
<br />
And you knew that fighting wasn&#39;t your strong suit, even though you had a lot of natural talent for it. Even though you had talent, mentally, you were not a violent being. Prefering a passive, happy lifestyle like you have had up until now. But if you ever wanted healthy children, you had to fight others for the best mates since you didn&#39;t have anything in place to set you up with one peacefully.<br />
<br />
But you had been a male for your entire life. Switching now was kind of intimidating, and you also would feel like you let your parents down by wasting all these years being son, only to throw all their hard work away. You know what they said about supporting your decision, bur part of you still would feel guilty. <br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t you even dare, even for a millisecond, about picking either one for a stupid reason like feeling obligated, or would feel guilty towards your father and I about something. If you do, I won&#39;t ever forgive you. I do not care at all about what you may think you owe to us, or have to do to satisfy us. We both only want for you to be happy. Even if it is at our own expense, understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
You mom was scary sometime. It was like she was in your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;That look on your face means that you actually were thinking about superfluous and superficial reasons. You idiot. This is the one time you get to be as selfish as you can. Forget about your Father and I. Our goals and desires are not meant to be achieved at your expense. Our primary goal and most coveted wish is for our own children&#39;s happiness. So do not consider anyone else&#39;s opinion benefit. And only what you yourself want most for this choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
What she just said had cleared up everything for you. It was actually quite obvious now that you thought about it. You look into your Mom&#39;seyes and clearly say with confidence &quot;I want to be a girl, Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Exactly. That is the right look my daughter. There isn&#39;t a doubt in your eyes anymore. Come, lets inform your father.&quot; You and your Mom begin walking back to the inner part of the nest. &quot;So, uh... how do I become a girl? Do you like unbirth me and relay me as an egg, or use some soecial magic circle, or what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Silly girl, haven&#39;t you realized yet that you have already changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
You stopped moving and examined your body. Sure enough, but extremely shocking, you were completely changed into a girl. But more than simply a swap of your gentiles, everything about you was different. <br />
<br />
For one, your scales were now a much redder purple, maybe even closer to maroon or a wine color as apposed to the dark purple thry had been. Your scales were also a lot smaller. But to compensate, you had many more of them, making your appearance a whole lot smoother overall. Where unlike the rigid, and hard but sturdy look your father had, you now had a softer (not actually, just visibly), flexible, and more gental look, similar to your Mother&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Where your previous horns angled forward, yours now flowed backwards. Instead of a prominent snout, with an angular head, yours was now more rounded, and streamlined. <br />
<br />
You also had breasts. Not as large as your moms yet, but sure enough. 2 rows of nipples donned your chest, each resting on top of a sizable mound which only slightly hung off of you. It was enough to feel their sway, but not enough to feel their weight pull you. You give one of them a poke, quickly recoiling a bit from instant pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like your boobs are just starting to come in. They are going to be very sensitive for a few hundred, maybe even a couple thousands of years. So prepare yourself. Once you fully mature, you will have become use to it. Plus, when you do eventually find your mate, they will feel especially nice when touched by them. Same when you start nursing.&quot; explained Mom. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just... when did this even happen? How long was I a girl?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ever since you closed your eyes to ponder. I changed you right then and there since I knew what your answer was already. All I had to do was guide you to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know I would want to become a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had always believed you would become one eventually. You just didn&#39;t have it in you to be a male dragon. Your entire existance practically screamed &quot;I am meant to be a girl&quot;. Plus, I have a very reliable talent for reading others. Many think I can even read minds because of it. Don&#39;t tell your Father about that though. If he knew that I couldn&#39;t actually read his mind who knows what crazy stunt he secretly will try to pull off and hide from me.&quot; <br />
<br />
You both laugh at that. Your voice also is very feminine sounding now too. Have you thought of a new name yet? Razor is a bit harsh sounding for a lady don&#39;t you think? But I won&#39;t force you to pick one if you really don&#39;t want to&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, how about, Karii?&quot; you propose.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is entirely up to you sweetheart. But with that being said, Karii huh? Hmm Karii. Kar-ii. Kaaaaarrrriiiiiiii. Karii, K-a-r-i-i. Yep, I think it is a lovely name. Ok then, if you are sure, then from now on you are my daughter, Karii.&quot;</p>
