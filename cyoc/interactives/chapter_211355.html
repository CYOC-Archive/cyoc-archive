<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The adult content warning is more there for the mention of a body part and not for the description of it...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whitney watched quietly as Jeff and Lucy went out with Melody and hoped things would be alright. The world she knew had changed greatly in the past few days, in that she and her children were exposed to the transformative magic from a pair of Slug Women that turned them into Slug People. Part of her retained a fair amount of guilt at how far she&#39;d fallen into a lust filled haze when she first transformed that she had even tried to involve herself with her children after transforming. It was embarrassing and the &quot;human&quot; part of her mind disliked that, even though she knew that Slug People were well known for a very healthy libido that easily exceeded humans.<br />
<br />
For the moment, a part of her was also dwelling on the present situation. As while they&#39;d managed to avoid the worst of things, and that Grace, Lucy, and Zoe were able to get her own mind back on straight, even if it led to Lucy and Zoe completing their transformations into Slug Women, it didn&#39;t remove all of the worries. They&#39;d found out that the Slug Women that started things were pawns for a human wizard and that had sent them trying to find help, and they had finally gotten some at the Slug People&#39;s colony, at least with some knowledge on their abilities and more details on the history that Slug People had had with wizards. But it also presented its own sort of risks in that because Slug Men were rare, it wasn&#39;t like Jeff and Simon would be able to do well over night in the same building, and then there was some of the looks that Lucy had given Simon&#39;s daughter Melody while they&#39;d been getting the history on Slug People and Cupple&#39;s attempts to woe the colony first.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, Mrs. Chapman that my daughter will respect your daughter and son,&quot; came Simon&#39;s voice from behind her, making her turn her eyes back to the Slug Man, &quot;Melody may have interest... but she would never force herself on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Whitney answered, &quot;though a part of me worries that I might be rushing things... like I&#39;m pushing Lucy into a relationship with your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That couldn&#39;t have been deliberate on your part, mom,&quot; Grace said to her from beside Whitney on the couch they were presently on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the two were looking to each other when they thought no one noticed,&quot; Zoe commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that will relate to a high libido, and to a degree a very open and honest desire for love,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;Slug People generally live a fairly open and &quot;friends with benefits&quot; sort of life... but that doesn&#39;t mean we are unaware of the sort of monogamous love that humans have. And we can enjoy that too. When humans have fallen for one of the colony... the two have stayed in a monogamous relationship that is just as solid as the happy marriages between humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
That helped Whitney a bit, though there was still the unease of the sense that she might be forcing her oldest daughter into a relationship, even if it was a relationship that Lucy might actually want as a Slug Woman. She felt Grace&#39;s hand touch her shoulder, and that made her feel a bit better, as Zoe slid off of the couch she was on and approached Grace and Whitney as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have more questions and concerns,&quot; Simon began as he observed this, and noted how the Chapmans behaved much like any Slug Person that had once been human. &quot;If you&#39;d follow me... I can get started on dinner and answer your questions, if you have any on all of this. Be it how to handle romances you have or what to do when it comes in the future... or alleviate any concerns you may have with your present situation. As... most times when I&#39;ve met humans who have become Slug People, it hasn&#39;t been because of actions like that of an evil warlock.&quot;<br />
<br />
They slid along after Simon as he led them through the living room and into a small passageway that had two openings on the north side. One door lead into a dining room with a circular table, though with no chairs. The other, a few feet down the hall were the kitchen and Whitney could catch the faint smell of food coming from there. It smelled like the food she normally kept in her house and was another reminder on how despite all their &quot;magical&quot; abilities, it wasn&#39;t as though Slug People either fed on what mundane slugs ate or on some kind of &quot;magical food.&quot; Grace also noted that every surface remained relatively hard and firm, no carpet. Though, given how much slime Slug People secreted, that&#39;d make sense.<br />
<br />
They entered the kitchen and Simon slid into an open area with a refrigerator, counters, and shelves forming a half circle. Grace, Zoe, and Whitney slid along to the other side of the counter as Simon looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any particulars on what you&#39;d like to eat?&quot; Simon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s your house, and we&#39;ve showed up unexpectedly,&quot; Whitney answered, &quot;we&#39;ll eat what you serve.&quot; She then scowled at Zoe when she saw her daughter make a face with one eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;I have a recipe for some chicken and corn that cooks fairly good. Hopefully you&#39;ll like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney, Grace, and Zoe then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... I sense you still have questions and concerns?&quot; Simon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s still the worry that I&#39;m pushing things with Lucy,&quot; Whitney spoke, &quot;that I noted her look to your daughter and decided to push them into a relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it would actually happen?&quot; Simon questioned, &quot;Slug People can form attachments, even those that hatched as Slug People, but a lot of times, it could just be a passing attraction. And if it is... Melody would be smart enough to know that given your present issues with Cupple, that acting on those things wouldn&#39;t be smart, be it with your daughter or your son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s again, good to hear,&quot; Whitney answered, &quot;but it doesn&#39;t change some of my worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given what a corrupted Megan and Jenny did to you, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;but ultimately, I think your heart was in the right place. Did you want there to be some kind of romantic adventure to be had purely for the sake of sex or something like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I... I guess part of it was just wanting Lucy to be happy, and knowing that it wouldn&#39;t be good to have Jeff here and thus putting pressure on you,&quot; Whitney managed, ignoring some of the looks that Grace and Zoe gave her with some surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d ultimately be no real pressure,&quot; Simon said slowly, &quot;Slug Men may have some degree of rivalry with each other given how few there are among Slug People, but we can control ourselves. And as for the rest... that sounds more like a loving mother to me. You wanted your daughter to be happy. Ultimately, if that means romance, that would be up to her. Nothing wrong on your part... or your daughter&#39;s... or mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Whitney asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Simon nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Lucy knows what she&#39;s doing,&quot; Zoe said in assurance to her mother.<br />
<br />
Whitney felt a little bit better at that as she watched Simon take some chicken breasts out of the fridge and setting them on a cutting board.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there any other questions?&quot; Simon asked, &quot;or advice on dealing with possible romantic partners you had before all this started?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been fairly fine with where I was,&quot; Whitney said slowly, &quot;and I&#39;m... I&#39;m not really sure if I want to get into anything right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a boyfriend,&quot; Grace admitted, &quot;though... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll get one now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never say never,&quot; Simon urged, &quot;regardless of our species differences, I&#39;ve found that there have been plenty of men and even a few women that have fallen for Slug People and even became Slug People to be with them. And all of which was done with permission and consent. Some things may be difficult, but you&#39;ll always find people of kindness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace blinked at that and managed a &quot;thank you&quot; while Zoe patted her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a boyfriend, either,&quot; Zoe admitted, &quot;and Jeff doesn&#39;t have a girlfriend... though, I do have a good friend, Maize. We were good friends in high school and did school sports together, though... I eventually found out she was a lesbian and had some interest in me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon was quiet as he went about the cooking, carefully cutting the chicken so that he&#39;d remove the meat from the bones.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we stayed good friends,&quot; Zoe continued, &quot;so, her sexuality was never an issue. Though... after becoming a Slug Woman... there are some things that are obviously different for me. I mean... you do look nice, and there are some thoughts that I don&#39;t want to have to admit having... but then... the same sort of goes for Melody as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A result of the fact that the only Slug People that have one gender are male,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;Slug Women, as hermaphrodites will be interested in both genders. Males for perceived potency for reproduction and other Slug Women because they are the most common among Slug People. That might also pull you, to a degree toward Human women as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was some of that there with Maize as well,&quot; Zoe admitted, &quot;we ran into her and her mom while looking for help... and well... as a Slug Woman... some of the things I didn&#39;t find attractive before were a bit more attractive now... and well... since Maize and I were good friends, if there was no way for me to go back to being human, I&#39;d at least be able to date someone I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a good thing... not to uncommon with former humans among Slug People,&quot; Simon nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if she doesn&#39;t want to become a Slug Woman?&quot; Zoe asked, &quot;what if she gets turned off by the penis I now have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I can&#39;t be sure on...&quot; Simon said slowly, &quot;but if this Maize has truly loved you since high school... I&#39;m sure that once all this with Cupple dies down... you two can talk on what you&#39;d both want and can accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Zoe nodded, &quot;I get that much... but that doesn&#39;t remove the worries.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Simon nodded, &quot;I wish I could do more to help, but I can assure you that honest conversation can go a long way, and if real love is there... this Maize will have no problem with you.&quot;</p>
