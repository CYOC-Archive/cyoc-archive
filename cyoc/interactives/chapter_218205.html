<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle woke up and stretched, she felt like she had slept a very deep sleep, like she hadn&#39;t in a long time. She didn&#39;t feel like she was this tired before, but her body must have used more energy to heal her of whatever it was that was hurting her, because her stomach wasn&#39;t churning anymore and she felt perfectly fine. Awakening better she realized many strange things, starting with the fact that she was totally naked despite not having slept like that. She was also in an outdoor location instead of her room, so she imagined that she might have been sleepwalking, taking off her clothes and leaving the house in her sleep. It also had the sound of several voices.  There seemed to be some commotion and several people were talking at once.<br />
<br />
Looking towards the direction of the crowd, she was startled, there really were several people at a distance, but they were all facing her, and they weren&#39;t just normal people, as there were press teams there that seemed to be covering some event. There were also police cordoning off the area around her, preventing anyone from getting closer. At first you thought they were far away as they looked small, until you realized they were much closer to her. She came to the frightening realization that the focus of their attention was on herself, and if so, everyone could see her naked. The situation was embarrassing for her, but a naked woman sleeping in public shouldn&#39;t attract such a stir.<br />
<br />
Michelle then looked at herself and her immediate surroundings, and was startled to understand the reason for the commotion. The building where she lived was badly damaged, and her apartment with her boyfriend was completely destroyed. The cause of such damage was even more shocking, as she realized that she had grown very large and was gigantic, so big that she obviously couldn&#39;t fit inside the apartment, having probably destroyed it as she grew up. <br />
<br />
&quot;How could her sleep be so heavy that she couldn&#39;t wake up while growing up and destroying the apartment?&quot; Michelle thought<br />
<br />
She was extremely embarrassed, not just because of her new size, but the fact that she was being seen by so many people, she was probably even being seen on TV. She then quickly got up and ran from there in the direction, avoiding the crowd, to try to find a place to hide. That wouldn&#39;t be easy, as she was now quite a bit taller than the five-story building her apartment was in.<br />
<br />
Running with them she clasped one arm to cover her breasts and brought her other hand between her legs to cup her pussy, but she discovered yet another shocking change she underwent by finding a massive set of cock and balls in its place. She suspected it would be 9 inches, but with the scale of her current size she didn&#39;t know the true proportion. The police started to chase Michelle, who got scared and ran away.<br />
<br />
Desperate and seeing no other way out, Michelle ran to the middle of the city, looking for less crowded places to avoid casualties. Dodging cars and pedestrians, and seeing other buildings around, Michelle realized that she was still growing, as she was still surpassing the sixth floor of the largest buildings. The situation only got worse, because despite everything, the new cock was hard and throbbing with excitement.<br />
<br />
The chase continued as the police received air backup, Michelle was terrified of being killed like the giant monsters in the movies. She avoided her hard cock, but it moved in a rush past walls or slamming against her. Eventually, even though she didn&#39;t mean to, Michelle came. At the moment she was already the height of a nine-story building, the amount of her giant balls&#39;s cum shot out by her cock was enough to stain the streets white, but she also ended up hitting several passers-by.<br />
<br />
Exhausted from the escape and the orgasm, but terrified of what could happen, Michelle stopped and raised her arms, then said &quot;I surrender, I surrender but please don&#39;t kill me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Michelle was taken away, but not before her body was wrapped in a huge tarp. The officers said they never intended to kill her, just to prevent innocent people from getting hurt. Her growth had finally stopped, but she was now nearly 100 feet tall. Michelle was guided, but she wondered where they would accommodate someone her size.<br />
<br />
Unaware of the extent of the damage, Michelle&#39;s contagious cum had stayed behind, contaminating anyone who came into contact with it.</p>
