<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy absently rubbed at his forehead…bothered only slightly by the pressing, burning sensation…his attention focused completely on the music box.<br />
<br />
Walking down the hall, he watched as the figuring moved gracefully in a circle as the music warbled out a tune from somewhere inside. Without thinking about it, he reached out and opening a door, stepped back into the changing room he had looked in earlier.<br />
<br />
A frown creased his face and then he asked, &quot;Must I put you down?&quot;<br />
<br />
The frown deepened and a look of worry crossed Tommy's face and then reluctantly he set the music box on a nearby bench, brushing a strand of white hair from his eyes, ignoring the burning sensation coming from his ears.<br />
<br />
As his ears shifted species and his hair grew out, Tommy looked at the music box, titled his head as if listening to something and then asked, &quot;You want me to do what? Take me clothes off? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another pause and then he nodded and announced, &quot;Well that's certainly reasonable,&quot; and slowly began to take his clothes off.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his jaw, which had started to fuse with his nose and push outward, he undid the laces on his shoes, hopping about to keep his balance and keep his eyes on the music box. <br />
<br />
Shoelaces undone, he placed his feet firmly on the floor and kicked off his shoes. Using his feet to pull off his socks, he then began to fumble about…his hands slowly changing from four digits and a thumb to three digits and a thumb…as he pulled his belt off and then in swell foop, pulled his underwear and pants off.<br />
<br />
His attention on the music box wavered for a moment as he pulled his shirt off, but the moment he could see the box again his attention returned and standing naked, unaware that his feet were shrinking and molding themselves into hooves as a long horse tail unfurled from the base of his spine, he cocked his head to the side as if listening intently.<br />
<br />
After a bit, he laughed...a rather horse like whinny but he didn't notice...and then said, &quot;You want me to wear what. The clothes in the open locker. Those are clothes for a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another pause and then, &quot;Can you really guarantee that nobody will notice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet another pause and then clopping around the bench, unaware of the white fur sprouting over his body, eyes firmly latched onto the music box, Tommy reached into one of the open lockers and pulled out a uniform for a cheerleader.<br />
<br />
Looking at it, failing to notice that he was shrinking, he all of a sudden asked, &quot;Put the bra on first?&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Tommy and he set the uniform on the bench. Picking up a small lacy white bra, he looked at it, listened to the music and then slowly struggled to put on the garment.<br />
<br />
As he fastened it in the back, he chest and nipples became sore and tender. The moment he had the bra fastened in back, his chest, nipples and areolas began to increase in size. By the time he had straps on, his chest had increased to a pert B cup. Without giving it much though, he pulled the cups on over his breasts and adjusted them, failing to see that his masculine frame was melting away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look good,&quot; Tommy asked of nobody, looking back at the music box.<br />
<br />
A pause and then Tommy nodded and said, &quot;I suppose putting on the rest would complete the look and who knows; I may even look cute,&quot; and picking up a pair of low-cut bikini briefs with a hole in the back, Tommy began to pull the underwear on.<br />
<br />
As he did so, his waist, butt and hips shifted sex and gender, but Tommy didn't notice as he adjusted his tail through the hole in the back. Next he reached down and picked up a pair of spandex shorts, black in colour. As he pulled them on, he failed to notice as the bulge in his crotch shrunk. As this occurred, a pinkish red gash formed between &quot;his&quot; legs and the vulva…lips majour and minour, clitoris and clitoris hood and vagina and urethra opening…started to form.<br />
<br />
Unaware that he had just turned into a she, Tommy picked up the blue and white skirt and began to pull it on. Overbalancing, Tommy suddenly collided with the bench and with a sickening crunch, the music box tumbled off. Suddenly the music stopped and as the figuring snapped off the top and went skidding across the floor, Tommy was suddenly aware of what he was wearing, what he was doing and partially aware of what he looked like.<br />
<br />
A ticklish feeling in her groin and abdomen...marking the final bodily change as the interior sex organs formed causing the rest of the body, but not the mind, to change sex and gender...Tommy hastily zipped up the hidden zipper on the side of the skirt and clopped across the changing room to a mirror hanging on the wall. What he saw brought a shrill whinnying-scream to his lips.<br />
<br />
Reflected back was something that looked like a Unicorn standing on its hind legs. A bright whitish yellow horn jutted out of Tommy's forehead, while the face swooped gracefully down into a horse's muzzle. Long flowing white hair…accented and highlighted by the white fur covering Tommy's body and with two ears poking out on top of her head…covered her head and turning she saw a tail poking out past the hem of the skirt. Up her back, she could just make out a mane.<br />
<br />
Turning around, Tommy didn't need to confirm that &quot;he&quot; had indeed become a female as he took in the B cup sized breasts. Eyes tracing the feminine curves, she guessed that her height was now five foot one and she wore a size petite to small. Looking at her hands and then her feet, wondering why they were hooves instead of toes, Tommy lifted the skirt, thought about touching to confirm that she was feminine down there, decided that the feel of everything would have to do for the moment and let the skirt fall back into place.<br />
<br />
Gazing into the mirror, feeling out of sorts, Tommy asked herself, &quot;Now what am I going to do? More importantly what are my friends and family going to say when they see me like this? What’s Sarah’s reaction going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to answer these questions and more, Tommy turned and clopped back across the changing room. Across the way, she could hear something through a metal door that sounded like a pep rally going on and suddenly she wanted to join. Instead she attempted to pick up the music box, stepping on it in the process and causing a crack to form down the side.<br />
<br />
Cradling it, she set it down on the bench, looked about, picked up the top of the cheerleading uniform and putting it on, attempted to sort out what she should do. After a bit, Tommy decided to...</p>
