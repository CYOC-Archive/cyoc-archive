<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sonia paused and looked at you, putting on a concerned face, she had clearly noticed your wide eyes as she told the story.<br />
&quot;Not too scary is it?&quot; She asked, in her most motherly tone.<br />
&quot;No misses Sonia!&quot; you pipe up. Wait did you just call her misses Sonia? This was odd, you felt a little different sitting there listening to the story, like it was scary, and you were having a hard time not getting afraid of what had happened to the guy in the story. But you also wanted to hear more.<br />
&quot;Ok well nap time is coming up after this story so I&#39;ll tell you more and then we&#39;ll see ok?&quot; She asked, nodding her head to prompt the response she wanted. &quot;MM&#39;kay!&quot; you say excited to hear more.<br />
&quot;Alright where were we...&quot; Sonia resumes her story.<br />
<br />
Brent and another boy were running down the hall to see what had made their friend yell. Just as they approached the door to the breakroom who should pass right through it in front of them but Sonia, the ghost of the daycare and perfectly perfect care taker. She hovered slightly off the floor, and glowed her usual transparent green. The boys slammed to a halt, the one behind Brent colliding with him and they tumbled to the floor in a heap. They were so afraid of her that they were scooting backward trying to get away almost instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit what is that Derek?&quot; said Brent, and so there it was. Derek. As Brent scooted away and regained his feet he backed in to the wall, trying the locked door behind him. Sonia pointed to Derek, who only let out a long sigh, fascinated by the specter in front of him. &quot;Is this a trick?&quot; he said regaining his composure, leaning in... Close enough that he felt something pass between him and Sonia. A cool sensation as the ghost grinned at him.<br />
<br />
A hand grabbed him and pulled him backwards by the shoulder, he almost fell over with the force of it. Then a slam and the door shut. Brent stood next to it breathing heavily, clearly having a panic attack. &quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; He looked at Derek, who calmly shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe a projector or like, one of those things they do with smoke.&quot; He was oddly calm about it. Brent looked him up and down, thinking this guy watches too many Horror movies and has become numb to real danger, then snapped his gaze back to the door. Derek fumbled at the wall then turned on the lights in the room which buzzed once and then flickered to life, long flourescent bulbs in the ceiling revealed a room filled with shelf after shelf of kids books, stuffed animals, glass fronted cabinet with bottles, and in one corner a long table with a step.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude don&#39;t be such a baby. This is some kind of prank. You&#39;re gonna give yourself a heart attack&quot; Derek teased. He put a hand on Brent&#39;s back and patted him to reassure him, then turned to inspect the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some kind of nurse&#39;s office. School nurse, ya think?&quot; Derek said. He glanced over his shoulder at Brent, who was fixed on the door like a guard dog. &quot;Look at all this shit. It looks kinda old. I think this place is abandoned.&quot; he said. He ran a finger along the counter top next to a sink with hard water deposits around the edges , and inspected the line in the dust. &quot;Dude she&#39;s not coming. Come on, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any good pills in the... the...&quot;  Derek found he couldn&#39;t move. He tried to take a step and couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s... &quot; was all he could say before an invisible force lifted him off the floor and flung him to the examination table. He landed with a crash, not too painful on the soft table but enough to scare him, his heart thundered in his chest. He struggled to move, to get free, and couldn&#39;t. It felt like a weight was pressing down on him, immobilizing him completely.<br />
<br />
From the door Brent just watched and whimpered once, a high sound of pure terror, he watched Derek&#39;s clothes peel off him. Shorts and shirt were roughly pulled away and tossed in the corner. Derek managed to choke out a breathless plea &quot;Help... me&quot; a struggle then &quot;can&#39;t move&quot; and more struggling. Brent just watched his naked friend twitch, pressing against an unseen force.<br />
<br />
With a pop, one of the cabinets opened and from it a large white bottle emerged. Then behind it something white and folded, it was thick and slightly reflective. Then Brent realized what it was. A diaper, and that bottle must be baby powder. He understood it just as it tipped upside down over Derek and released a puff of white, the tiny particles settling on his crotch, and perfumed the air with a smell he knew immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No.&quot; Derek grunted, but that was all he could do. The force pulled his legs apart slightly, and the floating diaper gently unfolded and slipped between his legs. Derek felt it slide up his back, and then saw the front like a cobra rising up between his legs to consume him. It spread wide, then pulled forward mashing his dick in to him. He pressed hard in to the cool padding, the plastic bulging outward between his legs as the diaper stretched to cover him. The sides of it popped as tape came undone, the bottom of the diaper pressed against his hips and the front wrapped neatly over it, tape pushing hard. Sealing his diaper in place. The pressure of it felt strange around him, where he was accustomed to loose boxer now he had a bulky thing of white plastic and cottony stuffing.<br />
<br />
The force released him and he took a deep breath all at once, suddenly not pressed in to the table, he sat bolt upright and rolled off of it. He backed away from it as if it was on fire, a threatening thing, for the moment ignoring the awkward feeling of walking in this new diaper he wore. A small giggle from behind him and he spun, startled, still flying on adrenaline. He met Brent&#39;s gaze, and he was no longer panicking, he was just smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are wearing diapers.&quot; He paused. &quot;Didn&#39;t you call me a baby a second ago?&quot; He snorted looking his friend up and down. Derek was just as much a gym rat as the rest, colorful tattoos decorated his left arm and a lion adorned his leg drawn in indigo. But his bulky white diapers were a shocking contrast to the rest of him. Feeling embarassed, Derek&#39;s hands shot to the front of his diapers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; He said, pulling at the front. He grabbed a handful of stuffing, pulling hard, and it popped and crackled loudly but did not come off. He looked confused. &quot;I...&quot; he said again. &quot;I can&#39;t get it off.&quot; He said pulling at the sides, the little tape fasteners stuck in place. He picked at them, them tried to push fingers under the plastic waistband of his diaper. No use, it was sealed tight. A plastic and cotton prison.<br />
<br />
Almost in a haze of terror he walked to the cabinet, still open, the bottles of diaper powder and row of dusty white diapers was on display and he wanted to inspect them for anything that could help. It was only a few steps to cross the room, but he waddled them in his bulky diaper butt swinging side to side and his thighs crushing the white bulge at his crotch. He pulled at it again, trying to move it around to feel like he was accomplishing something, but it was no use. He was diapered and stuck this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck.&quot; he swore under his breath, looking at his ridiculous diapers, then up at the cabinet. The bottles had no labels, the diapers had no brand. Nothing to help here. Nothing to indicate anything. He grabbed the powder and waddled back to Brent. &quot;Ok, I&#39;m gonna get my clothes over there in the corner and maybe I can cover this up until we figure out what to do. I&#39;ll take this though.&quot; He shook the bottle of powder at Brent.<br />
<br />
POOF the bottle emitted a cloud of white powder. The men started coughing, the perfumed scent filling not just their noses but sticking to throats and mouths. It was everywhere. &quot;Oh shit sorry.&quot; Was all Derek could say. Brent gave him a look as he coughed and dusted his shirt off. Then stopped.<br />
<br />
Brent looked up at him and jerked once, then stood still, then jerked again. &quot;Can&#39;t...move...&quot; he said. Derek just mouth a single word &quot;no&quot; and backed away from Brent the very instant Brent was picked up, and pressed in to the table.<br />
<br />
It only took a second for him to be stripped, and for the invisible force to produce a diaper from the cabinet. Derek watched, fascinated, and knew there was nothing he could do to help. He didn&#39;t even try. He just stood there, almost naked, as Brent&#39;s diaper pulled between his legs.<br />
<br />
Brent felt it slide under him, then saw it pull up and press tightly to his waist. The pressure on his crotch was intense, then the diaper seemed to stretch and pull, sealing itself around him. It crackled as the tapes pushed in to place, and the force released him.<br />
<br />
Immediately he moved his hands to try to pull it off, but knew it would not work. Just like Derek, he was trapped. Diapered. Sure enough, he was imprisoned in white plastic. He sat up, and swung his legs over the table. Looking at his bulging white diaper. Then looking at Derek, who stood stock still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awe. You look adorable though.&quot; He said and started laughing. An almost manic sound. Brent joined him, laughing at how silly they both looked. The idea that a ghost was haunting this building and that they both were naked except for white diapers. They giggle and gasped, tears coming down as they laughed. Pulling at their diapers, pulling at each other&#39;s diapers. They were stuck. Completely. The laughing trailed off, then stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... ok. Yeah we look stupid. But let&#39;s get dressed.&quot; Derek said. He pulled his shirt on, then his shorts, and looked down. His shorts bulged in the front and back. It was very very obvious he was wearing a diaper under his gym shorts, they were far too tight, designed to show off his hard earned muscles. Now they were showing off his bulky white problem. &quot;Ok. This probably isn&#39;t gonna work&quot; he said spinning around to try and see himself better. His diaper crinkled loudly as he moved, it was a dead give away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m not gonna bother. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Brent said feeling light headed. All this panic, the shock and then the laughter he felt drained. As he turned to open the door he saw her. Sonia. Standing just inside the room, floating silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw. You two look adorable. But let me go ahead and finish this off so I can get to your friends too.&quot; She gestured at them both, and Brent and Derek felt it. A shock. A tingling sensation spreading over them. Under his clothes Derek could feel his diaper swelling, pulling, it moved down his legs and up his chest. He jerked his head to Brent and let out another cry of surprise.<br />
<br />
Brent&#39;s diaper was not growing, Brent was shrinking. His arms and legs pulling inward, his skin was turning white all over. He moaned feeling his skin and bones become plastic and stuff. Derek did too, feeling the same sensations as he pulled inward, his diaper wasn&#39;t swelling at all, he was shrinking become part of it. It popped and crackled and so did he, be turned in to plastic, to cottony padding, and then with a little plastic &quot;thwap&quot; the diaper that had been Brent hit the floor, the tapes undid themselves and he folded neatly. Derek wasn&#39;t far behind. Inside his gym shorts he felt himself come unsealed, then fold. He was not wearing diapers, he was one.<br />
<br />
It was dark for a moment, then a hand pulled him away from his pile of clothes, pressed him in to another warm white diaper. He knew it was Brent, and then another was also pressed in to him. He was between two of them. It must be Kevin. The three of them had become diapers, he knew it, he felt it. He could see and hear, and feel but could not move.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we are boys. Just wait here ok, I&#39;ll be back with your friends in a minute.&quot; Sonia said, smiling at the three fresh diapers and gently setting them on the counter. She floated easily through the door, and flicked off the lights as she went.</p>
