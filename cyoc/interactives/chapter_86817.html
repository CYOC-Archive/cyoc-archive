<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Selene answered you, &quot;hugged you tightly, it&#39;s just that the prospect of you having to remain Michelle and having to start over with regard to finding an alternative to draining men of their life force... it is too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy,&quot; you said to her, &quot;best to be optimistic. I have the same fears too, and before Elizabeth and I got here... I was afraid I&#39;d spend the rest of my life as a sexual monster... Florencia gave me the choice between being a siren and bringing &#39;my wife&#39; back to the beach and transforming her or being killed, but you&#39;ve given me a great deal of hope with regard to getting my humanity back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled to her and hugged her. You soon felt Elizabeth come forward and hug Selene as well, Elizabeth&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You give me hope,&quot; you said to Selene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Selene gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if Michelle has to stay Michelle?&quot; Elizabeth asked after a moment, &quot;Not that I would be opposed to having my new sister around... but I can feel that that prospect hurts you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the worst happens and Florencia won&#39;t reverse her spell or the Council won&#39;t allow her to, we&#39;ll need to start over,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;rejoin the dating scene...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dating?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;How human men and women interact, Liz,&quot; Selene explained, &quot;they meet and talk and associate with each other... much the same way our sisterhoods do, but on a personal level of attraction. A man loves a woman and a woman loves a main...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this dating lead to...&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If things go right, marriage, where the two feel their love is unbreakable and they remain together, just as Michael and I had agreed to remain together as MAN and wife,&quot; Selene smiled, obviously thinking back to our wedding day, &quot;and with the mutual love forming between the pair... for us it is a great blessing. Michael&#39;s love for me, and my love for him created a great loop... I could feel his love and that gave me strength... it fed me and allowed me to be with Michael in every way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to date men,&quot; you stated clearly, &quot;I want to be me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you will,&quot; Selene answered with a sigh, &quot;but if the worst happens, you will have to... or accept being a traditional siren in feeding on men ever few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about you?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s save that for when we get to it...&quot; Selene told you, &quot;IF it comes to that. As you said... we should be optimistic. The Council will recognize my sisterhood, punish Florencia for taking what is MINE, restore your humanity and as the father of the siren in my womb grant you honorary status as a member of our society... a &quot;siren brother&quot; if you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like some sort of merman?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, sirens are always female,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;your position would be honorary and based on your connection to me and our daughter, but with regard to your species, you would be a human male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d get your old Sisterhood back, but with you as the head-sister, because I&#39;m sure that everyone else didn&#39;t know about what Florencia was doing either,&quot; Elizabeth added, &quot;We could all live together and swim together again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My place is with Michael, Liz, we may live near the beach and we&#39;ll come visit as much as we can, but we will live on land,&quot; Selene told her, &quot;and if you find a man to marry... you&#39;ll be with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A man for me to marry?&quot; Elizabeth wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t think I was the ONLY one who could fall in love, did you?&quot; Selene teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d never pictured myself in love with a human man before...&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;I figured there was never any way around feeding on human males.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;ll be a new world,&quot; Selene smiled.<br />
<br />
You found yourself giving a bit of a smile at this, as Selene seemed to be doing well, and Elizabeth seemed curious about the prospect of dating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the Council places things in the right again,&quot; Selene then finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do we do for now?&quot; you asked, &quot;do we go to this Council now? And are we to try and find a way around Florencia? She and the rest of her group are likely waiting in the cove where I stumbled onto them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They probably are,&quot; Elizabeth agreed, &quot;they gave Michelle twenty four hours to return with you, though from the way Florencia put it, they expected a human woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s BS on her part,&quot; Selene grumbled, &quot;She knew Michael was mine the instant she cast the spell... likely to make me miserable or force me to come back and submit to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how will we get around her?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;The town&#39;s harbor,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;It&#39;ll mean a greater risk of exposure, but it can manage it, and we&#39;ll be able to avoid Florencia, who will likely be with the others in the cove. We can then swim to the local Council and I can make my report.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when do we do this?&quot; you ask, &quot;Immediately?&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched Selene give a heavy sigh, &quot;No. The area where the Council is is near another town, but the journey to them will go through an area where there isn&#39;t a potential food...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes narrowed, &quot;Food?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle, my ability to avoid draining people was dependent on our mutual love while you were male,&quot; your wife spoke, &quot;but the fact that your breasts are bigger than mine... or at least bigger than they were before I started lactating for our child... and that your hips are as wide as mine and you&#39;re carrying the aura of siren magic to feed on men or transform them makes it clear that you are presently female... a mermaid... a siren. As such the way I could feed without hurting anyone doesn&#39;t apply. I love you and love you dearly, in more ways than just as sisters... but until you get your penis back, I will need to return to a more traditional method of feeding for a siren.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should be good for tonight, and if Elizabeth has made sure you fed, you should be good for tonight and tomorrow, but I will need to feed to feed not just myself but our daughter as well,&quot; Selene finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll probably need to feed tomorrow as well,&quot; Elizabeth nodded, &quot;and while Selene might be able to give her formal complaint against a rival head-sister, it&#39;ll take a couple of days for Florencia to arrive and reverse the spell that transformed you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means?&quot; you said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you won&#39;t like this, dear,&quot; Selene said weakly and placed her hands on your shoulders, &quot;but you&#39;ll need to feed again before you&#39;ll get to become human again. We can&#39;t leave tonight because we&#39;d be away from our food when Elizabeth and I would need to feed and by time that will mean you&#39;ll need to feed while we&#39;re waiting for everything to get sorted out with Florencia being called in and punished and so on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a monster!&quot; you almost immediately cried into Selene&#39;s shoulder, cursing all the hormones running through you, and privately wondering why and how so much of your personality was changing and becoming more what you thought of as stereotypcially feminine. You knew women that behaved just as &quot;manly&quot; as you did, and they were good friends. You remembered you and Selene going to dinner a couple of times with a couple of them that you knew. You&#39;d figured that while the spell had made you a siren that you would still keep much of your personality, yet you weren&#39;t in many ways. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you aren&#39;t a monster,&quot; Selene said, &quot;It&#39;s rough, I know... believe me... believe Elizabeth... we&#39;ve been sirens since we were born and have been around for several centuries... many sirens don&#39;t like the idea draining men. It&#39;s partially what set the rivalry between myself and Florencia. I always wanted to find ways around it... and couldn&#39;t find it until I met you... but that doesn&#39;t make me, you, Elizabeth, or even Florencia a monster. Monstrosity depends on our choices. And Elizabeth and I will be there for you... both while you&#39;re a siren and when you&#39;re male again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise,&quot; Selene and Elizabeth answered together, &quot;Tomorrow morning we&#39;ll take a few days off from work... call it a vacation... Elizabeth and I will feed and we&#39;ll head out and in a few days, we&#39;ll come back home and you and I can have a long talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you said weakly.<br />
<br />
You felt both of them hug you again. You knew there were no &quot;cheat codes&quot; out there and that if you wanted to be male again you&#39;d need to follow the rules, but feeling Selene and Elizabeth hug you gave you the confidence that things would be okay. Your wife had essentially forgiven you for your infidelity, you&#39;d get your humanity and your maleness back, and you felt your connection to Elizabeth continue to grow. Things would good, all they needed was time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I was working on dinner when you came back,&quot; Selene then spoke changing the subject, &quot;are you okay with some salmon fillets or has your day been too fishy for you?&quot;</p>
