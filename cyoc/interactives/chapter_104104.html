<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still on the remnants of rem sleep, the familiar known as Milly felt something gently poking at her face.  He desperately tried to cling on to the realms of unconsciousness but the poking persisted, forcing his eyes open, to see Deena in front of him.  The magical girl still in her night gown, giggling a bit as she continued lightly jabbing at the four winged cat creature.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up wake up wake up&quot; she whispered in an even more high pitch voice then normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Grrrr&quot; Milly moaned out, causing Deena to move back as he rubbed his eyes some, yawning a bit.  &quot;Fine I&#39;m up, I&#39;m up&quot; he muttered, his skin changing back from plush to normal fur, finally managing to fully open his eyes.  &quot;Happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup&quot; The Magical girl pointed at herself.  &quot;Deena Happy to be precise.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly rolled his eyes.  &quot;Even changed your jokes still aren&#39;t that great, sis-bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena put her hands on her hips.  &quot;Sis bro?&quot; She asked.  &quot;How many nick names are you going to come up for me exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As many as I feel like&quot; the Familiar explained, flying around.  &quot;So is there a reason you woke me up so early exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena looked over at a nearby clock.  &quot;You do know it&#39;s 10AM right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that should be early enough for today, shouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena shook her head.  &quot;Afraid not cat bro&quot; she then turned, leaving the room as Milly flew behind her.  The magical girl stopped at the dining room which was slightly altered to have more cushioned, bright yellow chairs and a multi colored table cloth on the table, despite the rest of the room remaining the same.  &quot;There&#39;s a  lot we need to discuss&quot; Deena said, going over to one of the nearby chairs and sitting down.  Crossing her legs, she pointed down at the table.  &quot;Over the most important meal of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly looked down to see a few overly brown pieces of toast with lots of butter on them and soggy Count Chocolate Chip cereal.  &quot;Impressive spread&quot; he sarcastically quipped, hovering near one of the seats.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfffft, I didn&#39;t gain any magical cooking powers you know&quot; she looked over at Milly.  &quot;Besides I don&#39;t even know what you eat now or... what you even should eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair point&quot; Milly said, using his long tail to grab one of the pieces of toast and drop it into his mouth, chewing it quite a bit before swallowing.  &quot;My tastes in some things remain the same, but I doubt my metabolism does.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well whatever you feel like we&#39;ll... find some way of grabbing for ya&quot; Deena said, chewing down on a piece of toast as she then pulled out several pieces of paper she put on the table.  &quot;But that&#39;s only point one.  The more important points are today&#39;s game plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that doesn&#39;t involve simply just wanting to hang out what may be the only day of rest this war may give, or having some down time to clean this area&quot; Milly pointed out, looking around at the still fairly messy house.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena shrugged.  &quot;Eh I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll still be able to have downtime, even if it&#39;s after we bust down all these NeFeinds.  And I didn&#39;t get any super cleaning upgrades either, so don&#39;t really want to spend much time making things less messy&quot; Deena pointed at the paper.  &quot;No, today will be trying to at least hit one of these hot spots Marissa and Patricia found out&quot; she then thought of the two happily sleeping together in the bed she made them, before spreading the paper to lay sheets next to one another.  &quot;Before my darlings needed to get some well earned Zzzss, they left quite a lot of useful intel and details on these places that I&#39;ve been spending time going over.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear&quot; Milly said, snagging another piece of toast.  &quot;It&#39;d be best not to go into these sort of things blind.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No diggity doubt&quot; Deena said, lightly biting on another piece.  &quot;Especially since even if the planet and the people are altered and changed by my magic, the NeFiends aren&#39;t really going to be.  Since otherwise we could just sneak around to every spot on the globe and blast everyone, and have all that magical white energy of magic girls scare them off planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Or make them want to come back in larger numbers&quot; Milly rubbed his chin.  &quot;Then again I doubt they have the power for a massive ground scale force right now, plus the point is to transform as much as needed to vanquish the NeFiends, not simply scare them off.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we can&#39;t hit spots that they&#39;d be aware of&quot; Deena pointed out.  &quot;Honestly for this recruitment to work, no one should really even know about us magical girls unless they&#39;re going to join the family.   We&#39;re altering reality to hide ourselves from those monsters until we can fairly fight them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which with their numbers, could be quite awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And that means being super careful any where we drum up numbers&quot; the magical girl looked down guilty.  &quot;Which means well...no places where....&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly sighed.  &quot;Yeah where my folks or anyone else possessed wouldn&#39;t know anything about&quot;  He then snapped in front of a still looking down guilty Deena.  &quot;Look I told you not to let it get to you okay? The fact we were transformed before they were taken meant the world was altered so  our former life&#39;s presence is missing.  Which means the NeFiends can&#39;t use them to get to us...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can still get them back&quot; Deena said determined, taking quite a serious bite of her toast and dramatically swallowing it.  &quot;And that will happen trust me&quot; she then shook her head, a grin appearing on it once more.  &quot;Especially once I gain control and transform the inhabitants of the first hot spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Silvers Manor&quot; Deena said laying her hand down on the table showing the image of a large looking, incredibly expanding estate Milly focused his eyes on.  &quot;See these were chosen as hot spots also because they&#39;re not only fairly close by, but bristling with activity we have to hit ASAP.  Especially this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Silvers&quot; Milly thought for a second, before gasping some.  &quot;Wait you mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena nodded.  &quot;Yeah, today&#39;s Alyssa Silvers big 17th birthday spectacular&quot; the image of a fairly uppity, high strung, long brown haired girl was shown giving a sneer in the magical girl&#39;s mind.  &quot;Before school starts tomorrow she&#39;s gathering all her family&#39;s servants and guards, a lot of the elites and high collar business men her folks associate with and other 7 figure earners who have kids who somehow still go to our old soon to be school base, for a big grand celebration.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly thought for a moment.  &quot;Oh yeah, now I remember&quot; Milly then narrowed his eyes.  &quot;Specifically you pitching a fit over not being able to go because of your mad crush on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Former mad crush&quot; Deena pointed at herself.  &quot;Now that I&#39;ve evolved I can see past Alyssa&#39;s hotness straight to her bitchiness, and how truly reprehensible she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems a bit harsh&quot; Milly pointed out.  &quot;Especially when you were sort of creeping on her before.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey that was the charming sort of creeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.... You want to repeat that back?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The POINT is I&#39;m going to amend her wicked ways&quot; Deena said with a smirk showing various papers.  &quot;With all the guests and servers and guards in attendance, there&#39;s bound to be 200-300 candidates alone for transformation purposes.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly raised an eyebrow.  &quot;So? The school&#39;s going to have over twice that many when it opens up tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but this will be in a much easier to control environment&quot; Deena showed various map pictures of the area of the estate.  &quot;I can&#39;t just point my wand at a two mile radius and transform everyone involved.  Heck at best I can transform maybe... 5 to 10 in a blast right now.  However by sneaking around and hitting specific areas first I can up my numbers and powers to not only grab the rest, but have more magic available to use on larger groups of people.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re being practical about this... and trying not to have it just be about revenge&quot; Milly said, flipping up a piece of toast to chomp down on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This is barely about revenge&quot; Deena pointed out, slurping up some of the cereal before wiping her mouth.  &quot;This is the biggest tactical advantage we can get right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Even compared to the other two &quot;hot spots&quot; then?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena sighed.  &quot;Look I&#39;d like to start out going after targets whose lives I don&#39;t mind uprooting, okay?&quot; Deena thought back to transforming Guy One and her parents.  &quot;The only reason I was able to transform you so easily was the rush of first getting the powers and not knowing the full danger of the mission.  And the only reason I was able to transform my own folk was because they were sleeping at the time.&quot;  Deena then pointed at herself.  &quot;Other people though may be a bit of a hassle, so forgive me if I want to start with someone who does nothing but give hassles, savvy?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MIlly thought for a second and nodded.  &quot;Very well&quot; he admitted.  &quot;You are the magical matriarch, so it is important though your spirits up for the morale of the troops.  Even if this is the sort of thing that may guilt trip you later-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughhhh, please don&#39;t find a reason to whine/preach about everything cat bro&quot; Deena said leaning back in her seat.  &quot;You&#39;re going to give me a head ache if you second guess ALL my calls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all of them&quot; Milly pointed out.  &quot;But I am an advisor, so it&#39;s my job to properly try and guide you as best as I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which should also mean giving me some space to think as well&quot; Deena said, slurping some of the milk from the bowl of cereal.  &quot;So that means giving me the space and freedom to do this as I see fit, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, Milly thought for a second and nodded.  &quot;Okay&quot; he said.  &quot;I&#39;ll try not to point out every detail I find issue with of your plan on the way there-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, my plan involves me going alone&quot; Deena clarified narrowing her eyes.  &quot;Mano... Uh Womano a womano.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Womano a 200-300 people&quot; Milly said, flying closer.  &quot;You&#39;re going to need back up.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get it from those I transform&quot; Deena then got up from the table, taking the pieces of paper she had laid down on it, as well as picking up another piece of toast as she turned away.  &quot;Plus I&#39;m going to need you to stay here and guard the fort, especially the treasure inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly, blinked quickly looking up to where the stairs were, and imaging View Marissa and Observe Patricia sleeping in bed.  &quot;Well we aren&#39;t going to be in danger of any attack but... considering even I&#39;m probably more of an attack type then they are-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Exacta&quot; Deena said taking out her wand, spinning it as a glow surrounded her, as she now appeared in her magic girl attire.  &quot;So hold the fort for me cat bro.  Be back with reinforcements real soon, who can also help us reinforce this place more as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh where exactly are you going to even put these reinfrocements?&quot; Milly asked.  &quot;For that matter, are there enough who could be transformation/creation types at that party to also change the locale to suit our needs? And-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t talk now, eating&quot; Deena said quickly shoving the piece of toast in her mouth as she ran off, quickly making a rainbow she jumped on as soon as she left the house to run off at high speeds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Milly called out, seeing Deena wave back to him, still chewing on the toast.  &quot;Oh she did not leave on that old cliché&quot; he grumbled, rolling his eyes before quickly shutting the door.  &#39;Well guess I should see what those other spots are&#39; he thought to himself, going back to the table and looking over the various notes, scarfing down pieces of toast still left over as he did so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We then cut over to the mansion as shown in the picture.  Specifically in a bedroom on the 4th floor where Alyssa Silvers, having her hair done up in curlers and only wearing a pink kimono and yellow sandals.  She was shown with an ear piece on, leaning her leg on a nearby very well furnished chair as she was shown painting her nails a light pink color.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha OMG that is so true&quot; Alyssa said, not noticing a fairly old, bald man in a black and white suit, carrying a silver tray in her open room, looking at her expectedly.  &quot;He would totes think he had a chance with me, but I know all about his so called hot ride.  For seriously, who still drives around in last year&#39;s Mercades model, gutter trash babies?&quot; The man tried coughing to get Alyssa&#39;s attention, only to be drowned out by the teenager laughing to the person in the head piece.  &quot;Yeah he can give all those sob stories about how it was a &quot;meaningful&quot; gift for aceing those stupid chem tests; that just makes him last year&#39;s nerd.  And who wants to associate with that right?&quot;  The man coughed again, actually getting Alyssa&#39;s attention who groaned.  &quot;Ugggh, gonna have to chat later Serena.  Help&#39;s trying to bother me again&quot; chatter was heard as Alyssa continued painting her toe nails.  &quot;Yeah sure we&#39;ll chat soon enough at my epic party.  Can&#39;t wait.  Love kiss kiss&quot; she then pressed a button in her ear piece, imitating a gagging motion as she turned more to the man.  &quot;OMG that bitch just can&#39;t shut her mouth for five seconds&quot; she said, seeing the man looking up at her.  &quot;Still this better be important Lemmins.  That was some level 8 gossip I&#39;m missing out on you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Beg pardon miss&quot; the man named Lemmins said, bowing and holding up the tray.  &quot;But I&#39;ve acquired the delicacy you asked about previous-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bout time&quot; she said, quickly lifting the lid off the tray to reveal a brown and yellow carmel looking desert with a glistening white layer of frosting drizzling down it.  &quot;For serious, what took so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Every chef was busy preparing the dinner and desert items for all the guests&quot; Lemmins explained, looking around the room and back at Alyssa, trying to hide a look of annoyance.  &quot;For today&#39;s fesitivies, which considering many of your friends have already started to gather in the back hall-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Pffft, half of those scotches are only there cause their rents could afford some decent gifts&quot; Alyssa said, quickly taking the tray and snaking on the desert, still talking as she chewed.  &quot;They aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot; friends.  Which you should only have about... 4 of at all times anyway.  Otherwise then your personal circle is way too crowded and it makes you seem... ugh, accessible or something.  And who wants that?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... Regardless, I&#39;m sure they would appreciate being in your company-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah them and the rest of the planet, but as you can tell I&#39;m like totally far from ready&quot; Alyssa pointed down.  &quot;Hello, barely even dressed here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lemmins looked over at a large walk in closet of a wardrobe.  &quot;Beg pardon man, but I do recall hearing you had wished to wake up early today in order to change and be ready promptly for today&#39;s activities-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, don&#39;t repeat what yesterday me said, cause that is so yesterday and I always move forward&quot; Alyssa turned around annoyed.  &quot;Second off, prompt means whenever, and whenever means whenever I feel like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... perhaps if you don&#39;t I could arrange-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you think I need people to dress me?&quot; Alyssa waved her hand.  &quot;Pffft please, that&#39;s only for times I have to wear something totally lame ass.  My look today is 100% me, and that perfection is going to take time to assemble.  Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So.... should I simply tell the guests and their relationships you&#39;ll be... along as quickly as that takes?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them to chill and wait to bask in my amazingness&quot; Alyssa went back to painting her toes.  &quot;This celebration is going to be huge Lemmins, but only once I walk in.  Till then let those little scurry ants wander around in a circle for all I care... so long as they aren&#39;t touching anything that belongs to me and I don&#39;t get bothered again, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lemmins sighed, turning away.  &quot;As you wish Mamm&quot; he said starting to take off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and come back and tell me if any rift raft or whatever tried sneaking in&quot; Alyssa said, frowning.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to deal with more people then agreed upon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no need to worry about that madam&quot; he said, the camera panning away to show a rather large silver fence around the estate, specifically at a point to the back lot where three somewhat toned and intimiating men, in black suits with sunglasses and ear pieces, holding loaded rifles were seen patrolling.  &quot;Security of the Silvers estate has always been top class, and I see no reason why that would change today.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly one of the men (a white guy with dark blond hair, with brass knuckles on his right hand)  gasped, quickly holding his gun in front of him defensively.  &quot;Intruder!&quot; He called out, the other two turning their attention to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going on about now, Jensen?&quot; asked another man (with black skin, short brown hair, and more noticeable bullet proof body armor under his suit), scanning the area.  &quot;There isn&#39;t anyone here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what about this?&quot; Jensen asked, pointing his gun over to a large brightly colored spectrum of light in front of him.  &quot;Obviously this is some new sort of advanced weapon&quot; he then aimed his gun in front of the light, forming the shape of an arc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks more like a thick rainbow&quot; said the third man (with tan skinned, a black cap covering his bald head, and a cigar in his mouth) stepping closer to the light.  &quot;Which is honestly the opposite of a weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jensen turned to the cigar smoking man. &quot;That&#39;s just what they want you to think Grey.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The one named Grey narrowed his eyes.  &quot;Who wants me to think?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Who else? Obviously some sort of new terrorist ploy&quot; he then held out his gun protectively.  &quot;Well you aren&#39;t scaring me!&quot; He called out loudly.  &quot;Come down like a real man!  Come down and face me or-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough!&quot; Called out the black skinned man, putting his hand past Jensen.  &quot;You aren&#39;t attacking bits of light on my watch, got me?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But Axer this is more then-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t what we&#39;re here for&quot; the one named Axer pointed out, turning to face Jensen.  &quot;We&#39;re here to protect against tangible threats, not ridiculous fairy tail conspiracy theories, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but the light.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey the light&#39;s fine&quot; Grey said, going over and waving his hand on the arc of energy.  &quot;Feels... kind of tingly actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Axer then turned to him annoyed.  &quot;I didn&#39;t say you could touch it, did I?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... of course not sir&quot; Grey moved away.  &quot;Just uh noting it&#39;s not a threat, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jensen then gasped, pointing up.  &quot;Well what about that?&quot; He said, quickly noticing a figure sliding along the light jumping down in front of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The figure, magical girl Deena Happy lightly dusted herself off, as the three men starred at her in amazement.  &quot;Man I hope I never get tired of that&quot; she said to herself, before turning and waving at the three men.  &quot;Hello!&quot; she said chipperly, continuing to wave as the arc of light disappeared behind her.  &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...Terrorist!&quot; Jensen quickly got out his gun, aiming it at her.  &quot;Prepare to die you-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Jensen!&quot; Axer yelled out, pointing behind him.  &quot;Prime Order Four: Do not shoot, especially to kill, unless specifically fired upon first or fighting against greater numbers.  Do not engage unless I order otherwise, PERIOD.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jensen sighed &quot;Very well&quot;  he muttered, looking disappointed as he put down his gun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As for you&quot; Axer turned his attention strictly on the magicial matricah.  &quot;State your name and business here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh where are my manners?&quot; Deena said, spinning around politefully curtsying.  &quot;The name is Deena Happy, Matriarch of the White Light Girls&quot; she rubbed her chin.  &quot;Hmmm may need a better name for that, but that will come later.&quot;  She pointed over to them.  &quot;Since my business here is getting new recruits for the coming terror.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the coming terror!&quot; Jensen shouted out, before getting a dirty look from Axer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No, see my war is against horrific demons, that I nick named NeFiends, looking to take over and use humans as their power source in a cosmic power struggle&quot; she then spun around.  &quot;The only hope is me and my crew, magical girls with super powers from another dimension&quot; she then struck a pose, a rainbow appearing behind her.  The rainbow quickly caught fire, alarming and scaring away some of the local wild life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Right&quot; Axer said sternly stepping closer.  &quot;Well whatever role playing activities you imagined have no business here, so either peacefully leave now or will be forced to apprehend you and have you jailed for illegal forced entry, do you understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Are you seriously not freaked out about this Axer?&quot; Grey asked, shown having stepped away several yards.  &quot;Enemy or not, the girl flew down on a freaking rainbow.  I think we can strike standard protocol off how to handle this situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you&#39;re the one who wanted to get all chummy with the rainbow&quot; Jensen noted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well that good vibe sensation wore off&quot; Grey noted, a few beads of sweat dripping down.  &quot;Now I&#39;m thinking of booking someplace this scene isn&#39;t happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t allow yourself to be so easily compromised&quot; Axer ordered.  &quot;Bizarre images aside, we handle every situation as ordered, no questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh, the stern serious type, that should be useful&quot; Deena said, taking out her wand scepter.  &quot;I think I&#39;m getting you first big boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha! Weapon! She&#39;s got a weapon!&quot; Jensen cried out.  &quot;Told you this was a terrorist ploy!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Grey looked over at him.  &quot;Normal terrorist ploys involve rainbows and magic wands?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They... could!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh I&#39;m far from a terror&quot; Deena said with a wink.  And in the quickest of instants, she shot a blast from her wand, hitting Axer as bright light enveloped and surrounded him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; Axer cried out, his body and his mind changing within the swirling glowing energy circle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Axer!&quot; Jensen cried out, taking out his gun and shooting at Deena.  &quot;Die die die die die die!&quot; he called out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The white energy barrier glowing with the colors of the rainbow appeared around Deena in an instant, shielding her from the storm of bullets Jensen was shooting out.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry he&#39;s fine&quot; Deena said.  &#39;Thank God I mastered this last night so I&#39;m also fine&#39; she quickly thought to herself pointing in front of her.  &quot;In fact, better then fine, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Afframtive&quot; said a stern voice.  But not the one of a 40 year old man, but a 13 year old girl.  Axer now stood a bit shorter then Deena, her black hair now longer and more lush around her body, losing the sun glasses to reveal large, red passionate eyes.  She was wearing a light black dress variation of an official school girl uniform with a fairly long skirt, red puffy sleeves and black spiked boots.  Her skin color was the same except with a bit more of a shimmer as instead of a gun, a large big red shield appeared in her hand, aiming it forward.  &quot;Shield Alexis is happy and content to be protecting Matriarch Deena from whatever may try threatening her&quot; she said in a curt tone, quickly spinning around and rapidly posing before going back in a defensive position.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm seems like some traits die hard&quot; Deena said with a shrug, various memories of Axer&#39;s life and experiences shown shuffling through her mind.  &quot;Then again  you&#39;re the first whose transformation I didn&#39;t have control of so-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut your mouth terrorist!&quot; Jensen cried out, still feeably trying to shoot at Deena, with Alexis now standing in the way, blocking all the shots with her shield.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what sick game you&#39;re playing but you give back the real Axer now, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, that person no longer exists.  Everything that ever existed about Ben Axer resides in my mind, and nowhere else&quot; Deena said, her energy shield dissipating as at incredible speed she then appeared behind Jensen, scepter wand in hand as she lightly hit him on the back with it.  &quot;And he&#39;s not the only one.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Before Jensen could retort, light energy appeared from, encompassing his entire body.  &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; he cried out in shock.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Grey, whose cigar had fallen out starring shocked at what was in front of him, shook his head, recovering as much as possible from the aww he was feeling.&quot;....Yeah sorry guys I&#39;m going for help on this&quot; Grey commented, running off as he quickly tapped his headpiece.  &quot;Back Post 2-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Before he could finish, Shield Alexis jumped on him, pinning him to the ground with her shield with one hand, and with the other quickly crushing his ear piece.  &quot;No interruptions&quot; she commented, looking at him sternly, tapping the shield as slight sonic waved shot out,  knocking Grey further into the dirt.  &quot;The Matriarch has chosen you for a reason, and you will follow them to the letter, no matter what the cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Man you haven&#39;t really changed... besides all the ways you have&quot; Grey muttered before looking to see the light die out in front of him.  He then saw what had become of Jensen.  Who similar to what had happened to Axer, had become a 13 year old magical girl wearing a black dress variation of an official school girl uniform with a fairly long skirt and blacked spike boots, with a shimmer to her skin.  Except she had incredibly reaching to almost her knees long blond hair, large violet eyes, purple puffy sleeves, various crystal rings on her fingers and a slightly smaller red shield she held proudly in front of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shield Jerrica reporting for duty&quot; the magical girl Jerrica said, smiling proudly as she posed, holding out her shield as three small guns came from them, shooting little energy bullets that blew up a nearby rock.  &quot;All evil, despicable terrorist NeFiends will be eliminated when we properly engage them, Matriarch Deena.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, good to hear Jerrica&quot; she said, rubbing her brow a bit confused.  &#39;Guess even if your memories are gone, certain traits carry deep&#39; she thought, various memories and images of Jensen flashing in her head.  She shook them off before walking over to Grey, Jerrica following behind her.  &quot;And that&#39;s two down, one to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Grey look a bit disturbed to see Deena get closer, holding out her wand.  &quot;You know uh... I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way I can help you as is&quot; he said, trying to scurry away as Alexis only pushed harder on her shield to keep him in place.  &quot;Without you doing...whatever this is.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena sighed.  &quot;I appreciate the gesture but trust me: this IS the only way&quot; she said, now a few feet in front of him.  &quot;Only the true white light of a magical girl can destroy the evil of a NeFiend.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... Look I don&#39;t really know what that means-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You will a second&quot; Deena simply said holding out her wand as the light wrapped around Grey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew I should of stayed home today!&quot; he quickly cried out before the energy enveloped him completely, his body and mind transforming.  Alexis jumped off of him and then appeared in front of Deena, still holding her shield out defensively and intently as more light surrounded the guy.  In less then a minute, the man known as Grey was no more as another figure got up in front of Deena.  Like the other two former guards, this was a 13 year old magical girl wearing a black dress variation of an official school girl uniform with fairly long skirt and black spiked boots, her skin also shimmering.    However she had on a cute white cap over her short blue hair, big blue eyes covered by a small visor, light aqua colored sleeves, a larger then Alexis&#39;s red shield strapped to her arm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Still feel like staying home?&quot; Deena asked, her hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The girl knelt down on her right knee, looking up at Deena intently.  &quot;My home is with you, Matriarch Deena&quot; A small opening on her shield shot out a smoke cloud, covering her and the rest of the group.  &quot;Shield Dubbed Grey gives her life to keep you safe and secure in any matter possible, whether fighting or hiding until we have no choice but to battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear&quot; Deena said, like before getting various memories of Grey flashing through her head before looking around, and giving a thumbs up.  &quot;And I especially appreciate the smoke cloud Dubbed Grey; we&#39;ll definitely have use for it for the next group.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are our next targets Matriarch?&quot; Alexis asked, still in a curt tone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena pointed above them.  &quot;I spent a good amount of time observing from above before making contact with you girls.  There are about 10... well 9 groups around the mansion guarding it and now that the smallest is taken care of, we can go around and recruit the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We hear and obey Matriarch&quot; Alexis said, kneeling in front of her.  Jerrica and Dubbed Grey repeated this notion, all three holding their shields in front of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that dears&quot; she said holding out her hands as energy from the three shield magical girls going around her.  &quot;Your love and support strengthens me, and I&#39;m going to use that to strengthen you, and our cause as well.&quot;  She then pointed in front of them.  &quot;So keep up the smoke screen Dubbed Grey.  You, Alexis and Jerrica will follow me an 8th a mile due east to the next group, where you&#39;ll quickly subdue them so I can turn them, understand?&quot; The three nodded as Deena rushed forward, the three following her as she was shown heading east.  &#39;Hope you&#39;re enjoying your party, Alissie&#39; Deena thought with a wicked grin.  &#39;With reality warped every time someone&#39;s changed, you won&#39;t even know I&#39;m here until I transform everyone.  And then I&#39;m coming for ya personally.&#39;  Deena&#39;s speeds increased as the three quickly followed after her as best as they could.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some time later Alyssa, now shown in a shiny silver thong and panty set, was shown leaning in a chair, slowly applying mascara as she admired the mirror&#39;s reflection in front of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you are going to be so, so hot&quot; Alyssa said to herself, only barely noticing another butler, this one with short brown hair and blue shirt in his suit had entered her room.  &quot;Ugghhhh what do you want Wigglins?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That... would be Wiggins mamm-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t like say something different from me Wigglins&quot; Alyssa spat out still focused on her own reflection.  &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy getting ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He looked to see Alyssa blowing more kisses at her reflection then spending time applying her make up.  &quot;... Of course mamm but it&#39;s past noon and quite a lot of the guests wish to know-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, perfection takes time&quot; she said, furrowing her brow.  &quot;Especially when you&#39;re bitching at me.  Seriously I am so getting you fired if this causes me any wrinkles.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... of course mamm&quot; he said bugging his eyes out.  &quot;It&#39;s just that your parents want-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please momsty and popples  know the value of looking your best&quot;  Alyssa said waving her hand.  &quot;Especially on your big day, so go away and let me focus here!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well... though is there at least a time you can give me that I can tell them-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah: Your ass is going to be kicked out if you say one word to me time&quot; Alyssa said as Wiggins quickly turned and walked off.  &quot;Seriously I&#39;m sure those peons can find some way to entertain themselves until I make my grand entrance.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Behind the Outdoor changing area near the mansion of the pool (which was located in the middle of the backyard of the manor) a sly looking teenager wearing a red and white bandana could be seen looking back and forth a bit warily, before turning to three other grungy looking teens next to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright check it&quot; he whispered, pulling out a joint quickly, as the other three teens faces lit up.  &quot;Yeah you know I always get the shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, how&#39;d you sneak that in?&quot; asked the most lankiest looking of the four.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The bandana one waved his hand.  &quot;Pffft, security on this place has always been a joke man.  Just make sure those stuffy suits aren&#39;t looking around, and you can sneak anything in.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope any means enough for us all to share&quot; said a slightly tubby teen, twitching some as he looked eagerly at the narcotic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The bandana guy nodded, the four not noticing a smoke cloud starting to form around them.  &quot;Yeah, hopefully enough to get this party started before the actual party gets started.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;My my, don&#39;t you know how harmful those things can be?&quot; Called out a voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The fourth teenager, a shorter one with a red cap looked around confused.  &quot;Man I&#39;m not even buzzed yet and already the world&#39;s vibing out&quot; the other three looked to see the smoke pooling around them even more as silohuettes appeared from the smoke.  &quot;This is your best shit ever man.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey this isn&#39;t my doing&quot; the bandana kid, quickly throwing the joint away.  &quot;So uh no need to report anyone or anything right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, no one&#39;s going to know about this&quot; from the smoke appeared Deena, holding her wand tightly with a bright smile on her face.  &quot;Well except me, but I doubt I&#39;ll care about remembering all the details from this little episode.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, she&#39;s hot!&quot; The lanky guy said, eyeing Deena up and down several times, before shooting a look over to the bandana guy.  &quot;Seriously she&#39;s more smoking then that Alyssa chick.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say&quot; said the tubby teen, desperately trying to cover his hand in front of his pants.  &quot;And that&#39;s not because of the smoke either.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s just to hide this particular little event&quot; Deena explained looking around, quickly blasting behind her to make all traces of the join disappear.  &quot;Apparently reality has shifted enough where near anyone could be invited to this party, thus explaining why you lot weren&#39;t on the notes I had before security shifted into my favor, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to be careful regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man we&#39;re cool&quot; the teen with the red cap said, trying to pool off a suave look as he glided over to the magical girl.  &quot;Almost as cool as your hotness.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If I didn&#39;t know your intentions, I&#39;d appreciate the compliment.  Still, you could turn out pretty hot yourselves&quot; Deena twirled two fingers on her left hand as from the smoke, two other figures appeared protectively around Deena.  One was Shield Jerrica, the other was another 13 year old magical girl wearing similar attire but with green hair, bright green eyes, aquarmine colored sleeves and a glowing orange shield strapped to her back.  &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll be a shield type like Jerrica or Ramona.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;To exist to protect the matriarch&quot; said Shield Jerrica, the smoke around shown coming from her shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A most worthy existence&quot; agreed Shield Ramona, eyeing the four as defensively as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Deena twirled her index finger on her right hand as two more figures walked carefully through the smoke.  They were like Marissa and Patricia; eight year old magic girls wearing a mix of orange and blue leotards, jackets and blazers, with red and blue sunglass visors covering their eyes, with various calculations appearing form them.  &quot;Perhaps a View type like Isis&quot; she pointed over to the one with bright blue hair, a butterfly tattoo near her eye, and bright blue thigh high boots with indigo tips.  &quot;Or a partner type like Suri&quot; she then pointed over to the one with light green hair, a unicorn tattoo near her eye, and pink thigh high boots with Maroon tips.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Our job is to collect all information on threats and issues about the NeFiends&quot; View Isis explained, twirling her arms around her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And whatever else is important to the mission&quot; Observe Suri stated, tapping around her as various dots lighted up on her visor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena then snapped her fingers as two figures quirkly twirled over the magical matriarch, pointing sharp weapons at the four teenagers.  These were 15 year old magical girls, adorned in golden corset chest plate armor, short yellow skirts with spiked armor surrounding them, spiked golden boots and yellow helmets with a spike sticking out of them.  &quot;Then there&#39;s the possibility of being a Lance like Vanessa&quot; she pointed over to the one with short Pink hair, red eyes, and the taller build, holding out a massive broadsword.  &quot;Or Katie&quot; she then pointed over to the Lance with silver hair, crimson eyes, and a more muscular build, holding a two sided axe in her left hand.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A Lance is always the first to strike at an opponent in battle&quot; Lance Vanessa said, slicing the air with her broadsword as it glistened with energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And makes sure to keep striking until the foe is vanquished&quot; Lance Katie commented, twirling the two sided axe before bringing it front of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena then whistled, as from the smoke two figures quickly flew out to land in front of Deena, but behind the six other magical girls.  These were a pair of 5 year old girls, wearing blue ballerina leotards, pink tutus, white tights, and yellow dance shoes, holding little golden wands (smaller in scale then Deena&#39;s) in their hands, and were giggling some.  &quot;Finally but most adorably you could be a Caster like Aiesha&quot; she pointed over at the little girl with platinum hair, blue eyes, a tree symbol on her wand, along with a glistening golden wooden tiara on her forehead.  &quot;Or Kimberly&quot; she then pointed over at the little girl with pink hair, yellow eyes, a stone symbol on her wand, and a light silver rock covered tiara on her forehead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Casters are the super coolest cause we can change all sorts of things&quot; Caster Aiesha said happily, aiming her wand at a nearby tree.  A beam shot out of it, making it take shape of a duck which she chuckled at.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And that makes us most versi...versat...verstail.....most use able&quot; Caster Kimberly pointed out, aiming her wand at a rock in front of the four.  It transformed into a couple of flowers which made Kimberly cheer happily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena clapped a bit.  &quot;Nice show everyone&quot; she said before turning back to the four teens, twirling her wand before she aimed it at them.  &quot;So which do you guys want to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Man I must of smoked the fuck out of something and not known it&quot; said the lanky teen, who along the others were just in a state of shock.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aisha pouted.  &quot;Mommy Deena, why do they keep saying bad words?!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry dears, they just don&#39;t know any better&quot; Deena then shot out a rainbow blast from her wand which hit the four, energy surging around them as they transformed.  &quot;Or rather, didn&#39;t.  Now that they&#39;re part of the family they&#39;ll behave&quot; she then raised an eyebrow as the light started to fade, seeing the still slightly glowing quartet.  &quot;I have to admit though, didn&#39;t expect a unique type from this group.&quot;  She then moved past the other magical girls, appearing right in front of the recently transformed teen boys.  &quot;Do you think you can please tell me who you are?&quot; she asked in a bright, cheerful manor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But of course&quot; said what use to be the bandana teen.  The four were now all about seven year old magical girls.  They were dressed in white and blue puffy dresses with two layers of petticoats underneath them.  They all also wore see through pantyhose, soft white slippers, and bright white caps.  And though the four didn&#39;t carry weapons or tools of any kind, each did have a pair of wings that sprouted from their backside.  &quot;I am Healer Momo&quot; she said, Momo having long yellow wings, blond hair, blue eyes, and an ice halo above her little head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Healer Mato&quot; said what use to be the lanky teen.  Mato had short little red wings, bright blue hair, brown eyes, and a fire halo above her little head, and was still the tallest of the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;I am Healer Nanao&quot; said what use to be the chubbier teen.  Nanao had gigantic for her size angel wings, brown hair, yellow eyes and a water halo above her little head, and was still slightly tubbier then the other three.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am Healer Nemo&quot; said what use to be the teen with the had.  Nemo had cloud formed wings, orange hair, brown eyes and a wind halo above her little head, and a little cap above said Halo.  &quot;And it is our job to help the sick and injured of our family feel better with our powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; Deena said seeing the four flying above her as she sighed.  &quot;Guess I better test that then&quot; she then aimed the wand at her own hand, shooting a bolt of energy that caused her to cry out, a decent sized cut having formed with blood pooling down her body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Matriach!&quot; The various magical girls cried out concerned.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll make you better&quot; Said Nanao, the other Healers nodding, quickly all flocking around Deena&#39;s arm as they held out their hands.  They each shot out a small ball of energy that hit the arm and the surround area, as soon all traces of the cut disappeared as if the attack had never connected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm, you sure did&quot; Deena said, flexing her arm out as she rotated it.  &quot;Feels even better then before&quot; she then turned to see the other magical girls a bit freaked out as she held out her hands concerned.  &quot;Sorry if I upset you any, I just needed to see how their power worked first hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You should of let us be hit Matriarch&quot; Ramona said, putting her hand on her heart.  &quot;You need to be protected above all else.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena shook her head.  &quot;We&#39;re recruiting and training now so above all else, this planet, it&#39;s populous, and our family are protected above all else&quot; she pointed around.  &quot;I appreciate and understand your loyalty but that commitment extends not just to me, but to everyone else, understand?&#39; Ramona looked at her and nodded, the other girls following suit.  &quot;Good to hear&quot; she then motioned the healers closer, gently kissing them on the forehead.  &quot;And don&#39;t worry with you cuties and others, damage will hopefully not be much of a problem going forward&quot; the healers blushed a bit at this as Deena focused her attention on Isis and Suri.  &quot;So what&#39;s our numbers at now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suri looked through her visor.  &quot;We&#39;re at 24 percent of the numbers at this location being part of the sisterhood of the White Light Girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Man I still need a better name for us&quot; Deena muttered to herself before shaking her head.  &quot;Well what&#39;s the next group we can hit without alerting a large group of people.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s three girls in the middle of the changing room who still haven&#39;t seen the light&quot;  Isis said, pointing to the north of them.  &quot;They&#39;ll be easy enough to corner if we hide within Jerrica&#39;s smoke cloud.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We shouldn&#39;t have to hide!&quot; Katie bellowed, holding out her weapon.  &quot;We need as many people as possible to kill the NeFiends! We should be rounding up everyone at once and-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Patience Katie&quot; Deena ordered holding out her hand.  &quot;Even though we could probably take everyone now, I don&#39;t want to risk it if I don&#39;t have to.&quot;  She pointed around.  &quot;I set up patrol groups and hideaways in case this operation went sour for a reason, and that reason includes not getting full of ourselves and attacking willie nillie, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Matriarch&quot; Katie said, looking down ashamed.  &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry I ever questioned your wisdom-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s fine&quot; Deena wend over, lightly rubbing her head.  &quot;I appreciate your passion and will need it going forward, as there are going to be times for more straight on attacks.  This though... this isn&#39;t one yet so we&#39;ll keep the covert operation going on.&quot; Katie nodded as Deena smiled at the group.   &quot;Some on girls, let&#39;s extend out some more family&quot; she quickly headed north with the twelve magic girls following her through the smoke, other view, shield, caster and Lance Magical girls seen around the area.  &#39;Slowly but surely the army&#39;s coming together&#39; Deena thought to herself, a slight wicked grin on her face.  &#39;Man I can&#39;t wait until that conceited so and so realizes what&#39;s happening.&#39;  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of Alyssa, the camera cut to her some time later, now in a tight body hugging pink corset as she held two different sparkly red dresses in hand.  &quot;Hmmm, this one is super adorable hot&quot; she said, looking over at the one In her left hand before looking at the other in her right hand.  &quot;But this one is hotly super adorable&quot;  she looked between the two, groaning some.  &quot;Ughhhhh life is like so unfair sometimes, only being able to wear one super amazing outfit at a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She heard a knock and this time an older looking female house keeper, wearing a plain blue dress and tattered white sneakers peaked in.  &quot;Excuse me senora Silvers&quot; said in the maid in a quite polite voice.  &quot;Do you need any help getting-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooooooooo!&quot; Alyssa cried out.  &quot;Seriously third world, haven&#39;t we been over this: perfection takes time to get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes of course it is just that I recall you having this same debate with a different choice of clothing an hour ago and selecting neither so-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh, that so wasn&#39;t the look&quot; Alyssa said, before peering at the two set of dresses again and grunting.  &quot;Actually on fifith glance, neither is this&quot; she then rudely threw the dresses at the house keeper, looking back into her closet.  &quot;I so need to pick out something that actually makes like a statement.  These are totally old rangs&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The house maid looked down at the dresses, fairly surprised.  &quot;I beg pardon, but these both seem like incredibly gorgeous gowns anyone would be impressed by.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alyssa rolled her eyes.  &quot;Of course you&#39;d say that Consuela: They cost more then your yearly salary.  Which you won&#39;t be getting if I find out they&#39;re scuffed at all after you&#39;ve washed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, if you did not wear them why would they need to be washed?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Duhhhhhh, they&#39;ve been out for awhile&quot; Alyssa then scrimmaged further through her closest pulling out more clothes.  &quot;Plus you know, you people touched them now so that is so another reason to wash them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Consuela looked a bit annoyed but sighed, swallowing her pride as she nodded.  &quot;If that is what you ask Miss Silvers, it shall be done&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh.  For serious, why can&#39;t you guys just say that every time I say something.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhhhh, trying to find the best fashion here and well can&#39;t do that with your unfashionable ass around so get out and wash those, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly.  And when I come back-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I&#39;m going as fast as I can but fashion emergencies like this take time to sort through&quot; she then held out two similarly styled gold dresses looking between them.  &quot;So go and clean up and make sure like no one&#39;s messing up my party got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, though the celebration&#39;s been going off without any issues&quot; she said, taking off from the room with the two dresses, soon halfway past the hallway.  &quot;Probably because you aren&#39;t there casing problems, Pinche idiota...&quot; she continued muttering Spanish insults as she headed down the hall.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Man my party&#39;s going to slam once I make the scene&quot; Alyssa said to herself, still picking between the dresses.  &quot;Must be boresville down there without me.  Oh well, rift raft always find a way to amuse themselves before greatness appears.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We then cut to Deena, happily skipping along a garden maze along the far corner of the backyard of the mansion, happily singing to herself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;La la la la la&quot; she said, spotting an older woman inspecting a flower and taking out her wand, quickly transforming her, a pair of View magical girls appearing in front of the transforming older woman, reporting her new name, Castor Dani, to Deena who continued her skipping.  &quot;La le la le la&quot; she repeated the process on an unaware older man, picking up the speed of skipping as she kept twirling around to blast people with her wand.  &quot;La le la la la! Le la lalala! Le la lalala! La le lo-&quot; Deena stopped, suddenly bumping into someone as the magical girl fell to the ground.  &quot;Okay, that was on me for being so careless&quot; Deena muttered to herself, the magical matriarch picking herself up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m sorry&quot; said a voice who Deena turned to, actually shocking the magical girl some.  It was a teenage girl no older then she had been, her long brown hair done up in pigtails.  She had a couple of freckles and long thick glasses, with a modest and presentable figure and bust size.  She was wearing a bright yellow sweater, modest green skirt, brown socks and black buckled shoes.  She had a rather large backpack strapped to her as she also got up and dusted herself off.  &quot;I need to be more careful where I&#39;m...&quot; the girl then turned to look at Deena, gasping and squeezing at the magical young lady in front of her.  &quot;Oh my god, that costume is incredible!&quot; The girl said, rushing around at high speeds around Deena, the magical matriarch still in shock.  &quot;The colors, the fabric, the texture... I&#39;ve seen such articulate and incredible stitch work from such a detailed piece.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&#39;No it can&#39;t be&#39; Deena thought to herself, looking at the girl still rushing all around her.  &#39;This... can&#39;t be.&#39;  Deena then coughed a bit, the girl focusing her attention at the mystic young lady&#39;s face.  &quot;Um sorry I... don&#39;t think we&#39;ve met before.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my I&#39;m... I&#39;m so sorry&quot; the girl said gently backing away, waving her hands.  &quot;That was like really weird and personal right? I&#39;m so sorry, I don&#39;t want to bother or annoy you or anything but... that is just such an incredible outfit you&#39;re wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I think so too&quot; Deena said lightly scratching the back of her head, clearly looking embarrassed.  &quot;Though I&#39;m sure you say that about any old thing uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Abigail&quot; the girl pointed at herself, beaming a large smile.  &quot;Abigail Presslin&quot; she said extending out her right hand.  &quot;Can I ask who you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Deena&quot; said the magical girl, sheepishly shaking Abigail&#39;s hand.  &quot;Deena Happy&quot; she said, still looking a bit nervous.  &quot;Nice to uh... meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The feeling&#39;s more then mutual&quot; Abigail commented, eagerly shaking Deena&#39;s causing the magical girl to bob a bit.  &quot;I mean I don&#39;t want to be rude or anything, but I have like a thousand questions.  Seriously where did you get such amazingly rendered fabrics?  I&#39;ve never seen anything shine or shimmer like your outfit which if I might ask, is it from anything in particular? I mean if it&#39;s from something I totally want to know and if it&#39;s something I can download and view right away.  Thought if it&#39;s an original, is there some sort of amazing story or concept behind it? Because there really should be and you should totally be trying to sell the concept to whoever would buy it.  Maybe like TomangaPop or-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Matriarch!&quot; A voice cried out as a Lance with short brown hair, blue eyes and a muscular build jumped down.  &quot;Is someone assaulting you?&quot; she asked, taking out a mace.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena quickly shook herself out of her daze.  &quot;No no no, nothing like that&quot; she quickly said, turning back to Abigail.  &quot;I just... need to talk to her alone Lance Deska, so tell the others that okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; said Lance Deska, narrowing her eyes.  &quot;But the second you report any trouble we&#39;ll make sure to take care of it&quot; she warned before jumping off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abigail turned to look over at her.  &quot;Woah, that&#39;s another incredible warrior garb!&quot; she called out, incredibly amazed.  &quot;Seriously is that from your series Deena? And did you see her jump like that? It must of been like 10 feet away! Man is like the most amazing thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  Seriously are you guys part of some sort of magic act or-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena looked to see Abigail continue gushing as she groaned, looking down annoyed.  &#39;Ughhhhhhhhhhh, why is she here?&#39; Deena asked herself, memories now flashing back to a week or so ago where Guy Two was seen in class with Abigail, taking a sketch book she was working on and flipping through it, laughing at the pages as Abigail tried in vein to get it back from him.  &#39;Seriously, this was suppose to be a locale filled with either jerks or people I didn&#39;t care to transform, not innocent people previous me constantly bullied&#39; various other images of Deena&#39;s head filled with picking on and insulting Abigail, even a couple making her cry as she desperately shook her head.  &#39;No no no no! That life was behind me! I&#39;m no longer that jerk!&#39; She then took a look at the mansion, imagining Alyssa there and sighing to herself.  &#39;Then again, isn&#39;t that why I chose this place to take over first? So I could bully and torment someone I didn&#39;t like?&#39;  She thought of the other magical girls she had transformed.  &#39;I mean yeah we need to gather larger numbers and... I&#39;m so thankful for each member of my new family but... everyone else here I didn&#39;t care about who they were before, and they deserved this fate&#39; she then peered over again to the exited Abigail.  &#39;This one&#39;s... different though.  I know the consequences of this fight now and... what it means to everyone who participates and... can I force that on someone who I already did nothing but torment and bully?&#39;  She recalled talking to Milly earlier in the morning.  &#39;Ugh I should of listened to Milly about this leading to a guilt trip.  But no I just forged ahead without thinking about it AGAIN and... now this...&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abigail then saw Deena&#39;s sour face, stopping her chatter mid sentence as she gasped, putting her hand on her shoulder.  &quot;You okay?&quot; she asked concerned, looking down embarrassed.  &quot;Look if I&#39;m bugging you... I understand and I&#39;m sorry.  I know I do that a lot when I see something amazing but well... you just have such a cool look and it just made me well... just fangirl I guess.  So again... sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena looked up and shook her head.  &quot;No... don&#39;t be sorry&quot; she whispered out.  &quot;You... you don&#39;t have anything to be sorry about.&quot;  Deena then reached over, lightly grabbing Abigail&#39;s hand.  &quot;I&#39;m the one who should be sorry... should apologize to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abigail blinked.  &quot;Huh?&quot; She asked, adjusting her glasses.  &quot;Why? I... I thought you said we haven&#39;t met before.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I lied because technically... we have&quot; Deena muttered, her eyes focusing on Abigail.  &quot;And at the very least... I should let you know why that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... okay&quot; Abigial then noticed a rainbow surge of energy appear around the two from Deena&#39;s wand.  &quot;Uh... Deena-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; Deena said, sounding a bit sad.  &quot;This is just going to show you the truth is all.&quot;  Suddenly there was a white space instead of the garden area in front of them.  Deena then separated from Abigail as the white space then glowed, various objects starting to from around it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what is this?&quot; Abigail asked, before she then saw an image of herself, a memory from a couple of weeks ago.  &quot;Hey... why am I over there and...&quot; she then saw someone approach the other Abigail and push her to the ground.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey get out my way art fail&quot; said the memory of guy two, the memory of Abigail falling to the ground.  &quot;I&#39;ve got places to be, bitch bro, which don&#39;t involve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But...I wasn&#39;t even in your way&quot; said the memory of Abigail, slowly picking herself up.  &quot;There was no need for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There was all the needs for that&quot; guy two said, quickly stepping over her.  &quot;So get your lameness out of here.  I&#39;ve got the cool people to hangout with.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro!&quot; Suddenly a memory of guy one appeared which the memory of guy two headed for.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The two smacked their fists together.  &quot;How&#39;s it been hanging?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad.  How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just giving that geeky art nerd the usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Nica nice&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it&quot; the two laughed then headed off as the memory of Abigail was forced to quickly pick up the books and papers scattered around.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The regular Abigail looked confused at that.  &quot;Wait isn&#39;t that-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;A person who no longer exists&quot; said Deena, appearing next to her, looking down sadly.  &quot;But a person who was such a jerk loser he felt better picking on someone who he felt was lesser then him.   Which somehow convinced him he was better, even though deep down he actually knew what was better, but just wasn&#39;t wise enough to see that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abigail turned to Deena confused.  &quot;Was... that someone who picked on you too?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No that... was me&quot; Deena said, ashamed.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...What?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena held out her hand.  &quot;You wanted to know where I got this attire from right? Well again you deserve to at least know that story.&quot;  Suddenly various flashes of light hit Abigail all at once as hundreds of thousands of images and memories processed through her at lightning speed.  The first ones of Guy Two but those eventually faded as he transformed into Deena and Guy one into Milly as all the information on the magical girls, on the NeFiends, and the quest the two have been on the last day and the history of the battle that Deena knew as well as those she had transformed all hit the mind of the young girl with glasses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What the... wait that... how in the....&quot; Abigail said the memories continuously flashing by her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay&quot; Deena said supportively, putting a hand on her shoulder as the two then appeared back in the maze, Abigail&#39;s eyes wide as the memories continued buzzing around her.  &quot;I just figured you out of everyone here deserved... needed to know the truth, that&#39;s all.&quot;  The magical matriarch clenched her first tightly.  &quot;And know that bully.... that jerk I was... I remember that and I guess in some from, still have some of that mindset.  But... I want to use these powers... these gifts to help people.  My family... my town... my world, however I can.  And... that I wish I had the power to go back so at least in my ignorance I wouldn&#39;t of hurt you any.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abigail rubbed her forehead confused, still in a sate of shock.  &quot;This is all... so amazing... so... so above anything I could of ever imagined.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I... I know that feeling at least.  Was a huge rush for me when I first go the wand.  I just hope you know... you aren&#39;t mad at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mad?&quot; Abigail said, blinking a few times.  &quot;Why... would I be mad at you?&#39;  she then grabbed Deena&#39;s hand, squeezing them tightly.  &quot;You&#39;re like the coolest most amazing person ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Deena shook her head.  &quot;No.... no I&#39;m not.  What you saw obviously proves that I&#39;m not.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In turn, Abigail shook her head.  &quot;No, it proves you sacrificed your self to forever become this incredible white knight of justice, eternally dedicated to stopping and vanquishing evil at any cost.  Seriously that is beyond amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know at the time though&quot; Deena pointed out.  &quot;I just rushed into it without thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you didn&#39;t choose, if you didn&#39;t agree it never would of happened&quot; Abigail stated, shaking Deena again.  &quot;And unless those memories you gave me are a lie, some part of you even then must of agreed.  Because otherwise you would not of been able to transform at all, and the world as we know it would be doomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s still over simplifying it&quot; Deena said, still ashamed.  &quot;Plus again... it doesn&#39;t excuse what I... what that guy did to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you... he... that guy... okay look I&#39;ve been bullied a lot in my life&quot; Abigail said, narrowing her eyes.  &quot;And it wasn&#39;t just by one person.  Other guys, girls... so called friends, even family who liked mocking me for my appeareance and tastes and everything&quot; she looked down eombarassed.  &quot;I try not to hold grudges on that sort of thing.  Otherwise you know... I&#39;d probably be angry at everyone in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry to hear that&quot; Deena said concerned, as she looked over at her seriously.  &quot;I&#39;m sure even if old me knew that he wouldn&#39;t of-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Look it&#39;s clear that you is a thing of the past&quot; Abigail said looking around.  &quot;The you now has other things to deal with, like making an incredible super army of Magic Girls to combat the threat of the NeFiends.  That&#39;s way more important then what happened between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena actually smirked a bit.  &quot;You mean more important then that old version of me anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The two chuckled a bit.  &quot;And that old version of me&quot; Abigail interjected, stopping Deena&#39;s chuckle as the girl with glasses leaned in closer.  &quot;Who also isn&#39;t going to exist right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena blinked a couple of times.  &quot;Well...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay&quot; Abigail said with a grin.  &quot;I&#39;m fine with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...What?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She put her hand around Deena.  &quot;The second I saw you I could see there was something incredible... something amazing with you I wanted to share.  When I talked to you I knew that and... now that I&#39;ve seen the truth I know what that is&quot; Abigail held out her hand.  &quot;View, Shield, Lance, Caster, Healer, even a mix inbetween.  I&#39;m ready to become whatever&#39;s needed for the cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait you... you want to be transformed?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well technically regardless of what I want, it&#39;s going to happen right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena looked down embarrassed.  &quot;Well... I mean if you really didn&#39;t want to I... I would try finding a way to-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t work though&quot; Abigail pointed out.  &quot;If I don&#39;t transform and just slip away. then I could end up being used by the NeFiends right? And then they&#39;d know you were gathering a force to stop them, and squash right there, and the earth would be doomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... Yeah I guess that&#39;s true&quot; Deena realized.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And hey, if what else you think is true, then being a magical girl is all sorts of amazingness&quot; Abigail said, imitating shooting a wand.  &quot;Helping transform and fight for justice whatever evil force comes your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It... is pretty fun&quot; Deena admitted recalling fighting the low level NeFiends yesterday.  &quot;Seriously you don&#39;t feel bad hurting and squashing those who want nothing more then to devour your soul and use you as fuel in their conquest of your planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet&quot; Abigail said, spinning around Deena.  &quot;Plus you get the most amazing costume ever&quot; she said, lightly poking at it.  &quot;Seriously I&#39;d agree just to get to wear that alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but it&#39;s a... full time commitment.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can transform your attire if need be right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well somewhat but I meant in general&quot; Deena held out her hands.  &quot;This is not a game Abigail.  This is a full time mission you won&#39;t ever get to back out from.  Even if... even when we win and destroy the NeFiends, all the magical girls who transform will stay that way, forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abigail thought for a second before getting a determined expression on fer face and nodding.  &quot;Then that&#39;s the way it has to be&quot; she said simply.  &quot;If I&#39;m volunteering then it will be all the way in.  Even if that means there is no way out, I&#39;ll be fine&quot;  Abigail thought for a second.  &quot;Honestly all I had to look forward to anyway was hopping to get good enough grades to score a possible nod for a medicore college to get an art degree for a one in a million chance as an Avant Garde fashionista.&quot;  She then folded her hands behind her back.  &quot;And really... if you let me pick my outfit for joining your sisterhood.... that&#39;d be good enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... Are you driving to drive a hard bargain because... that&#39;s not really much of one, no offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t really need one&quot; Abigail said earnestly.  &quot;I know that once you transform me, dad won&#39;t remember so he won&#39;t be sad, so really what other loose ends are there to worry about?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I... guess there&#39;s none if you&#39;re sure&quot; Deena said, sighing some.  &quot;I didn&#39;t really want to transform anyone today I actually liked before they became a magic girl but... if that&#39;s what they want, who am I to argue?&quot;  Deena held out her wand.  &quot;Just know this Abigail Presslin: You are a loving and brave girl who more then anyone else today is proving their worthiness for the cause.  One who I will be honored finding others and training and eventually, going into battle with.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here&quot; Abigail said grabbing Deena&#39;s wand.  &quot;And don&#39;t worry about me Deena.  I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well more like you&#39;ll be... guess we&#39;ll find out soon.&quot;  Deena said simply as her wand began to glow as energy soon coursed from it which surrounded Abigail as she felt the energy course around her and simply continued smiling at Deena as she transformed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From the hideout a couple of miles away, Milly looked shocked to see a rainbow appear on one of the screens in front of him.  &quot;What in the...&quot; he said as the Indigo color of the rainbow glowed before disappearing, leaving six other colors on screen.  &quot;Wait was that...&quot; his eyes then glowed, information flooding him.  &quot;Woah she found one of those already? Impressive, thought I wonder who it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Inside the energy storm Abigail was seen twirling around around in a mix of a purple and blue swirling environment, noticing her clothing disappear off her body.  Her physical form was tweaked a bit, growing to be slightly taller then Deena but with a similar figure to the magical matriarch, albeit with slightly less pronounced boobs.  Her brown pigtails grew even larger, glowing and sparkling with energy as the thick glasses on her face disappeared, replaced with Indigo contacts which now matched the color of her eyes, nail polish, lipstick and cheeks.  Energy circulated around Abigail, which soon became her magical girl attire.   Like Deena she wore a yellow body snugging corset, mini dress with four layers of pettitoat and padding, whte opera length gloves and sparkling white pantyhose.  However the dress was a dark Indigo and blue mix with various symbols on them; she had an indigo tutu that puffed out longer with ribbons with crystal bells attached to them.  She had on spiked heeled Indigo boots with little chains attached to them.  There were now crystal indigo pieces she wore as earings and pigtail decorations, with an indigo tiara on her head.  Finally a bright indigo sword appeared in her hand, though one without a blade.  However as she grabbed the blade and spun it around, a tornado appeared where the blade would be as she swung it around a few times, before twirling and making a dynamic fighting pose.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The energy then stopped glowing around the two as Deena stepped back, looking over at the figure in front of her.  &quot;Abigail&quot; she asked concerned.  &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Great&quot; said the figure, with a wide grin on her face.  &quot;Though I&#39;m no longer Abigail Presslin.&quot;   She held out the sword proudly twirling it in the air before catching it.  &quot;I am now Gale Force, newest member of the White Light Girls, dedicated to destroying the evil NeFiend presence on our planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear&quot; Deena said with a sigh.  &quot;Though your name is far better then what I named our group.  I still need to think of something better then that.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you will&quot; Gale said still beaming a smile, looking down and admiring herself.  &quot;Wow, this is just the look I was hoping&quot; Gale said, flexing her hands, quickly removing one of her glove to feel the texture of it and her dress.  &quot;Man whoever you got these powers from, they sure have incredible taste&quot; she said feeling the outfit some more before putting the glove back on.  &quot;I really do love this outfit.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it&#39;s... a lot like mine&quot; Deena said, going over and inspecting her some.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; Gale said, looking embarrassed.  &quot;I just really loved your look and wanted to try my own take.  I thought I had made enough differences so it wasn&#39;t a you know total steal-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean... it&#39;s an outfit... and honestly a power more like mine then the others&quot; Deena said inspecting her.  &quot;I thought everyone else transformed would be a type like Caster or Healer or Shield or Lance or even View/Observe.  You&#39;re... you&#39;re different somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Different good right?&quot; Gale cupped her hands.  &quot;Since you said I could change how I wanted and I really liked this look but... if you don&#39;t want it I&#39;m sorry-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no you&#39;re fine just... wondering how it happened like this, that&#39;s all&quot; Deena scratched her head.  &quot;Then again no one else exactly volunteered or anything so...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gale then looked around, spotting something as she held out her air sword.  &quot;Oh hey speaking of others&quot; she then lept up, a tornado gust pushing up as Deena covered her arm some from the force of the gusts.  Gale quickly lept on top of the hedge maze, aiming her air sword as she sent out a couple of wave of tornadoes to some snooty looking older women slowly walking through the maze.  They were hit by the wand and gasped some, before glowing and transforming into Lance Magical girl with variations of black, orange and blue hair, each wielding a unique weapon like spear, spiked claws, and chain whip.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lance Belle, ready for action&quot; said the Lance with orange hair and spear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lance Jasmine, prepared to fight&quot; said the Lance with blue hair and spiked claws.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Lance Jane, reporting for duty&quot; said the Lance with black hair and a chain whip.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena looked up amazed, rubbing her eyes in disbelieve.  &quot;What... what did you do?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gale gasped, quickly leaping down and bowing a couple of times.  &quot;Sorry sorry sorry&quot; she said.  &quot;It&#39;s just that I knew we needed to make more for the cause and... I just sensed them there and-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean... how did you do that?&quot; Deena held up her wand.  &quot;Though I use the strength of others to up my powers, my wand is... was the only one who could transform others.  You know being the Matriarch and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well shouldn&#39;t everyone have the power to transform though?&quot; Gale asked.  &quot;You know to build the biggest army possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena shook her head.  &quot;Considering how most everyone else&#39;s mind set changed and they don&#39;t remember who they were it... would be too messy and chaotic having them also change others.  Plus my ability to do so is kind of what helps me stand out more being in charge.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you obviously still are&quot; Gale Force said, holding onto her air sword tightly.  &quot;But I guess I can help out with that too.  That&#39;s... a good thing right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena thought for a second and nodded.  &quot;Of course&quot; she said, now smiling.  &quot;More help is always appreciated Gale Bro... uh Sis&quot; she then gave a thumbs up, walking over to the Indigo colored magical girl.  &quot;There&#39;s still about half the people left here to transform before we can take over the manor, and having you help out should make it take much less time.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear&quot; Gale looked around.  &quot;Especially since it seems like Alyssa still hasn&#39;t come down for her own party.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I was wondering about that, as no one I transformed knew anything about why she isn&#39;t around yet&quot; Deena admitted.  &quot;You think she&#39;d be soaking in all the attention by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I did hear a rumor spread around she was still taking time to be ready&quot; Gale chuckled some.  &quot;Heh guess she&#39;ll never have to worry about that after being transformed right?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, especially with what I have planned&quot; Deena said, smirkly darkly quickly before shaking her head.  &quot;So hopefully we can save her for last and get everyone else here.&quot;  Gale nodded as the two took off through the maze and on the other side, quickly finding another small group they transformed into a mix of View/Observe and Caster magical girls.  &#39;I guess having reality warped could explain why Abigail was at this party&#39; Deena thought, noticing Gale next to her with their wands out.  &#39;But why does she have her memories and transforming powers like me?  Is it just because she agreed or...&#39;  Deena saw Gale&#39;s bright smile and shook her head.  &#39;Eh I&#39;ll ask Milly later.  There are other things to take care of now.&#39;  She then focused back on the task at hand, transforming those around them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This pace kept up for awhile with Alyssa slowly picking out pieces for her grand attire as unbenowist to her, more and more of her guests and soon friends and even relations were being transformed around her.  Around about 2:30PM or so there was only one figure even inside the Silvers Mansion: the young 17 year old girl who finally stepped out of her room.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, perfection has arrived bitches&quot; Alyssa was heard calling out as she sauntered out of her room.  The young Miss Silvers was shown wearing giant hoop diamond earrings, a very revealing low cut crimson dress with a minx fur around the top of the dress, silver stockings, and red high heeled shoes.  Her make up glistened as she snapped her fingers a few times.  &quot;Servants! Announce to the crowd I&#39;m ready.&quot;  She looked around, not seeing anyone in sight and groaned, snapping her fingers several more times.  &quot;Servants! SERVANTS! SERVANTSSSSSS! COME OUT NOW!&quot; She roared, starting to walk down the halls of the empty mansion.  &quot;WHERE ARE YOU?!&quot; She shouted, waving her arms.  &quot;YOU ARE SO ASKING TO BE FUCKING FIRED IF YOU DON&#39;T REPORT IN NOW!&quot; She bellowed, still not getting a response.  &quot;Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&quot; she hissed, pounding the side of the wall a few times before breathing in, eventually calming herself down after a minute.  &quot;Why is good help so hard to find when you actually need it?&quot; She rolled her eyes.  &quot;Seriously bugging me all day when I don&#39;t need them, but then like vanishing when I do.  What&#39;s up with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to know?&quot; Said a voice, Alyssa looking around confused as a trail of light spun around her, before revealing to be Deena, now appearing a few feet away from the rich girl.  &quot;It won&#39;t matter soon anyway, but I guess you deserve at least that curtsey.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alyssa imitated gagging.  &quot;Ugh, what the fuck are you suppose to be?&quot; she asked disgusted.  &quot;I didn&#39;t call poofy lame ass clowns to come perform at my party.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena rolled her eyes.  &quot;Or maybe you don&#39;t&quot; she replied, before smiling over at Alyssa.  &quot;I&#39;m actually Deena Happy, Magical Matriarch of the white light girls&quot; she said, spinning around before making a v for victory pose and wink.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alyssa groaned, rolling her eyes.  &quot;Am I suppose to be impressed or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the name still needs work, as does everything else honestly, which is why I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Look begging for charity never works&quot; Alyssa waved her hand.  &quot;I don&#39;t care how starving or poor or sick or whatever you are, find a way to make money without bitching to me about your lame little problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not interested in your money Alyssa&quot; Deena said, moving closer.  &quot;Contrary to what you believe, it does not automatically equate happiness.  It is simply a tool used in order to order to achieve stability and expanded output in order to function in a society I&#39;m honestly not fully even apart of anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miss Silvers rolled her eyes.  &quot;Ugh this sounds like a gay ass speech.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a nice thing to say... or even a sensible thing honestly&quot; Deena held out her hand.  &quot;Seriously how can words choose to be in a romantic relationship with something of their same gender if they wouldn&#39;t even have one?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;Duh cause..... s-shut up!&quot; Alyssa stomped the ground.  &quot;Seriously bitch about whatever to security before they throw your ass out.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Two things wrong with that&quot; Deena held out two fingers.  &quot;First, I wouldn&#39;t waste someone&#39;s time talking about that.  And second, and more importantly the only security around here is MY security&quot; the magical girl held out her hands.  &quot;While you&#39;ve been getting all dressed up, I&#39;ve been doing my own preparations, all culminating in this one moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares?&quot; Alyssa turned around, walking the other way.  &quot;I have actually important things to take care of and-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I use to think you were something special Alyssa&quot; Deena said, in front of the Silvers girl again, causing Alyssa to freak out some.  &quot;Maybe it was just because of your body or money or other surface level clichés, but for some reason I did have some fondness for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How... how the fuck?&quot; Alyssa then recalled Deena spinning around her as light earlier.  &quot;Wait... what the fuck... are you...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;However that was because I was ignorant&quot; Deena went on, ignoring Alyssa&#39;s words as she held out her hand.  &quot;About a lot of things honestly.  Can&#39;t pretend at all that was your fault, but once I evolved past basic primal desires, it dawned on me how hollow and truly despicable a person you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you... you get away from me!&quot; Alyssa said trying to run off, only for Deena to appear in front of her again.  &quot;Ahhh!&quot; Alyssa cried, slowly trying to crawl away as Deena slowly walked towards her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The kind who thinks they&#39;re so above and beyond anyone else, and treats other terribly because of their own vanity.  The kind who could never understand the thousands upon millions of other problems that exist in the world.  The kind that honestly shouldn&#39;t ever flourish in any society&quot; Deena continued walking forward, narrowing her eyes.  &quot;And that was before I even really knew anything about you.  And when I did find out those feelings only intensified... only made me see how terrible a person you really are.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you don&#39;t know anything about me!&quot; Alyssa tried desperately defending, looking around for a possible escape or for something that could take down the threat in front of her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh but I do&quot; various memories of people associated with the mansion flashed through Deena&#39;s head as she continued her speech.  &quot;You want to mean to a jerk who picks on others for his own insecurities? Fine, guess I won&#39;t hold that against you.  But being so hateful, spiteful and vicious to friends, family, the people who raised you, who take care of you, whose job it is to see you happy no matter how sad and angry you make them feel... that is truly unforgivable.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Get away from me!&quot; Alyssa begged, her body leaned up against the side of the wall as Deena was now directly in front of her, grabbing Miss Silvers by her arm as she desperately tried struggling away.  &quot;GET AWAY!&quot; She tried scratching and clawing at the magical matriarch, none of her hits really landing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Deena said simply, freaking Alyssa out even more as she grabbed her other hand, leaning her further against the wall.  &quot;See, things have changed Alyssa.  You aren&#39;t allowed to be cruel... to be spiteful to be bitter towards anyone EVER again.&quot; Memories again pooled around Deena&#39;s mind as she leaned in closer.  &quot;To be honest with what I know I should force you to apologize over and over again for your harsh words, threats and actions.  Until I earnestly truly believed you were even the remotest bit actually regretful for everything you&#39;ve done&quot; Alyssa was shown shaking at this point, a couple of tears in her eyes as she desparatley still flailed in Deena&#39;s grip.  &quot;However, I don&#39;t have that kind of time and honestly, the people who deserve to hear that groveling no longer exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t kill me&quot; Alyssa whimpered out, still struggling.  &quot;I.... I can... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena leaned closer, a playful grin appearing on her face.  &quot;Relax dear, I&#39;m not a monster: I&#39;m simply someone chosen to vanquish them&quot; she then flipped around so now Alyssa was in front of her.  &quot;Who in turn chooses others to help in that fight, which includes you&quot; Before Alyssa could object Deena glowed with energy and pushed forward, allowing her and the young Silvers girl to move at great speeds through the manor.  And having gone past some of the halls and down the stairs, Deena still holding Alyssa pushed her through the doors to the outside, letting go of her as the doors closed behind them.  &quot;So welcome to the sisterhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The....&quot; Alyssa looked around in shock, looking around to see Gale Force and the various View, Shield, Lance, Caster, and Healer class magical girls all around her, smiling brightly.  &quot;What the... what is...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said I am Deena Happy, matriarch of the white light girls&quot; she held out her hand, the girls all waving at her as she then waved back.  &quot;An in progress name for an in progress family, who you&#39;re about to join.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...No!&quot; Alyssa tried running back inside.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what this shit is but I want no part of it-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad&quot; Deena held out her wand, a rainbow of energy coming from out of it that tied Alyssa&#39;s arms up.  Deena snapped her fingers as two of the Shield class girls (one with red hair and several stars on her shield named Emma Lee and another with blue hair and lightning bolts on her shield named Beverly Jo) jumped forward, grabbing the tied up Alyssa and presenting her in front of Deena.  &quot;I&#39;m not giving you a choice in the matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But but... but this isn&#39;t fair!&quot; Alyssa bellowed, trying to shake her way out of the grasp of both the shield girls and the energy.  &quot;You can&#39;t do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I obviously can and will&quot; Deena then held out her wand in front of her.  &quot;Casters Catherine, Ashley and Cassie please report forward&quot; as soon as she requested this three of the Casters quickly ran forward, pushing past others of the group as they soon made their way to Deena.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Caster Catherine here&quot; said the first with yellow hair, blue eyes and a paper symbol on her wand with a small paper crown on her forehead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Caster Ashley super here&quot; said the second with blue hair, yellow eyes and a steel symbol on her wand, a little steel rod crown on her forehead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Caster Cassie super duper here&quot; said the third with magenta hair and eyes, with a glass symbol on her wand and small glass crown, as the three then turned to each other and giggled some.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena leaned down, gently rubbing her heads.  &quot;Awww aren&#39;t you guys so cute?&quot; she said, the three beaming happily at the compliment as she then turned over to Alyssa.  &quot;You recognize them?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...No&quot; Alyssa asked, in a tone that tried to be disgusted but was still filled with more fear and confusion.  &quot;Why... why should I?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you probably shouldn&#39;t as the people they use to be only exist in here&quot; Deena said pointing to her mind as memories of Lemmins, Wiggins and Consuela appeared raced through her mind.  &quot;Like I said, I&#39;m not a monster.  I&#39;m making the effort to remember and store info on whoever needs to join the cause, so in some form they still exist&quot; she then looked over at Catherine, Ashley and Cassie standing there as she lightly picked the three up, hugging them.  &quot;And in their case I certainly know they&#39;re happier as magical girls then having to serve you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would we serve her?&quot; Catherine asked, her and the other two tightly hugging Deena back.  &quot;You&#39;re the one we love and care about Matriarch.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; she said, putting the three down.  &quot;And you should know I feel the same way, which is why it will only be me and these memories that will especially appreciate what&#39;s going to happen next.&quot;  She pointed at the three.  &quot;Girls I&#39;m going to need your help with this transformation. so please grab and transfer some of your power into me, okay dears?&quot;  The three nodded, lightly holding onto Deena&#39;s legs as white energy soon circulated around them which began to circulate around Deena.    She then focused again on Alyssa.  &quot;You see Alyssa, I can only transform those I knew personally however I want... at least with just my own power&quot; the energies circulated more around Deena as she held out her wand scepter, pointing it at Alyssa dramatically.  &quot;However if I have the help of those associated with someone, well the change falls back into what I want.  And you know what I would want?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You bitch!&quot; Alyssa called out, shocking some of the younger magical girls and making them throw angry looks at her.  &quot;I don&#39;t care what you want! This day was suppose to be about me!  Every day&#39;s suppose to be about me! Me me me me not you meeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that&#39;s the opposite of what I want&quot; Deena then shot out a bolt from her wand.  &quot;This however...&quot; Emma Lee and Beverly Jo moved back as the bolt hit Alyssa, making her screech out as the rainbow bindings disappeared, the Silvers girl transforming before the group&#39;s eyes.  &quot;This is the birth of something different&quot; Deena turned to the other magical girls.  &quot;Sans me and Gale&quot; she saw Gale Force quickly wave at her as Deena went on &quot;We&#39;ve had six types in our family so far.  Views that work with Observes, Shields, Lances, Casters and Healers.  And though I&#39;m sure there will be other types, this is a special type I&#39;m creating for certain well &quot;special&quot; cases&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Rahhhhhhhhhh&quot; Alyssa cried out one last time before the transformation totally overtook her as soon her transformed self appeared in front of the group, who looked happily intrituged at the sight before them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Meet your new sister&quot; Deena held out her hand as the transformed Alyssa stepped out.  She was now only 12 years old with a bright shine in her long brown hair and energetic silver eyes.  Her attire was now  black panties, pantyhose and girdle all matched perfectly; a simple black pencil dress with a row of mock buttons in front, a heavily starched peter pan collar with matching cuffs.  The dress itself had a tapered hem, which ended above the knees.  It was hidden behind a pinafore apron, straightened out the starched ruffles and tied it into nice big bows behind her back.  The shoes were patent leather Mary Jane style with moderate heels and a wide strap to keep them securely on her feet.  Finally there was a small little white cap on her head as the transformed Alyssa looked down, looking fairly embarrassed with red blush marks on her slightly made up face.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;G-greetings&quot; the transformed Alyssa said in a very soft, quiet voice, politely curtseying before the other magic girls.  &quot;I... I am Maid Fioara&quot; she said, shaking some.  &quot;I am honored to make all of your acquatainence and... and....&quot; she looked flushed seeing all the other magical girls smiling at her as she quickly turned, running into Deena and hugging her tightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww it&#39;s okay dear&quot; Deena said in a comforting tone, lightly patting her head.  &quot;I know you&#39;re shy, so just stand behind me if you don&#39;t want to talk to anyone else, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maid Fioara quickly separated from Deena, bowing before her.  &quot;Of course, Mistress Deena&quot; she said, the matriarch lightly wiping away some tears.  &quot;I will do whatever I can to serve and... m-make you happy&quot; she said, quickly going behind Deena, hiding behind the older magical girl. to peak out at the others.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As demonstrated, the Maid types are a different kind of support&quot; Deena explained, feeling Fioara gently lean against her backside.  &quot;Unlike other types who will either assist in gathering information, construction, or assisting in combating the threat, their magic and strength reside more in maintaining the various structures we&#39;ll be operating at&quot; Deena pointed over to the manor.  &quot;Once our first home base has been fully transformed, I will have a few other specially chosen maid types assist with the cleaning, cooking and general care giving of these sort of estates.&quot;  Deena waved her finger.  &quot;Just because technically Maids will be the weakest types in pure energy does not mean they are the least important.  Just like everyone else, they will have their use and purpose and deserve the same amount of respect and love as I expect from all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand&quot; said the other magical girls, in as much unison as they could muster.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good&quot; Deena extended her hand back to gently pet Fioara on the head.  &quot;Fiaora will be my personal maid at the first home communications hub.  Which I do have to honestly get back to very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There were some disappointed and sad sounds from a lot of the magical girls at this.  &quot;You&#39;re... leaving matriarch?&quot;   Asked one of the healers, who had bright orange hair, small hummingbird wings and a crimson halo on her head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Only for a little bit, Healer Nissy&quot; Deena said assuredly before she held out her hands.  &quot;I have other things to prepare and go over but I assure you, when I gather forces to take over the place that will become our training grounds tomorrow, we will all meet again.&quot;  She then moved a bit closer to the other girls, holding out her hands.  &quot;Before I go though, I want to say a few things to all of you.&quot;   Energy glowed around her, showcasing the various colors of the rainbow as started her speech.  &quot;Today truly is the first day of this war&quot; she then made a fist.  &quot;If I had any other option, I would fight and take out any NeFiend or creature trying to use and harm this planet on myself, and not involve any one&quot; she then scanned around at the various magical girls.  &quot;However, that is not the kind of battle that we are going to fight.&quot;  She then focused on some of the Sabers, holding out various weapons with a gritty, determined look on their faces.  &quot;This is a battle we will all have to contribute to.  Whether directly assaulting the foes on the front line&quot; Deena looked over at Shields, holding out their arms in a defensive, protective way.  &quot;Protecting our companions in battle&quot; the Matriarch focused on various healers, energy twirling around their bodies as they happily floated above everyone else of the group &quot;Or helping them recover whatever injuries they may sustain.&quot;  Deena&#39;s look then turned to Casters, focused on her but playing with their wands, various energies emulating from them.  &quot;From whatever homes and hobbles and structures we craft, we will always be evolving and changing to better face any oncoming threat&quot; she then saw the Views, their visors glowing as they looked around scanning various energy, their Observer partners doing the same thing. &quot;As we have the resources to find and locate any information and objects to help further our efforts in this war.&quot;  She then shot a small glance to Fioara still in back of her.  &quot;But I also want to make sure of we are taken care of not only in active duty, but when there are times we need to rest, recover or just take a break from the onslaught.&quot;  She then narrowed her eyes, taking a quick glance at Gale Force before focusing on the group as a whole.  &quot;For I know though many of you only know of this war and your duties, I also want you to know... want to experience any type of joy and bliss you wish to feel.&quot;  She then held out her hands.  &quot;For we are not just an army, not just the defenders of this planet, but above all else, a family.  A unit whose power comes from our love.&quot;  She then pumped her left hand above her head.  &quot;For our cause, for our world, and most importantly for our sisterhood.&quot;  She glowed again, the magical girls soon replicating Deena&#39;s gesture.  &quot;For the White Light Girls fight for what&#39;s right, with all our might, against NeFiend&#39;s blight, no matter the height, through the day and night, for only when our foes we fully smite, that will end our plight!  Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot;  Called out the magical girls, all glowing with energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t hear youuuuuuuuuuuu!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;ALRIGHTTTTTTTTTTTT!&quot; They called out, more energy glowing from them as they started shooting up power into the sky.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh turn it down turn it down&quot; Deena quickly said shaking her hands as the magical girls energy quickly retracted back, but the glow still remaining a part of them.  &quot;Good&quot; Deena said pointing to the crowd.  &quot;Okay while I&#39;m gone, Gale is going to be in charge.  And I expect you to show the same amount of loyalty that you show me, understand?&quot; the girls all turned to Gale who waved at them and then back at Deena, noddly eagerly.  &quot;Well guess that&#39;s it&quot; she then saw a few of them look down a bit sourly.  &quot;Unless there was... something else you girls wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Healer Nanao was shown flying in front of some of the other girls, outstretching her arms.  &quot;Before you go can I... pretty pretty please have a goodbye hug Mommy Deena?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Matriarch rubbed her chin.  &quot;Hmmmm&quot; she looked over at the other 300+ magical girls starring at her.  &quot;Would anyone else also want a hug?&quot; she asked, seeing pretty much everyone&#39;s hands shoot up, a hopeful smile appearing on their face.  &quot;Well.... then okay&quot; she said, flexing her wand.  &quot;Line up as orderly as possible and I promise to give all your darlings a personal goodbye.&quot;  The group cheered at this as they were shown all bumping and pushing into one another.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I get the hug first&quot; said a blond, green eyed reflective ball Shield girl named Lacely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No me&quot; said a Lance with a lilth build but long fingernails with twin tridents named Ebony.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Me me me!&quot; Said a Caster with curly blue hair,  a wand with a fan shape on it and a fan crown named Othello, with many voices shouting and trying to vie to be closest to Deena, as the magical matriarch could only sigh at this, trying to hide a hearty chuckle of so many wishing to be so close to her.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&#39;Man old me would of been over so many &#39;babes&#39; having their sights on spending time with me... well you know not the more younger tykes anyway&#39; Deena noted to herself, still with a grin plastered on her face.  &#39;Oh well let them have their share of me.  It shouldn&#39;t take too long to get through all of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Over two hours later, outside the mansion ground, Gale Force could be seen peering around inside the gate, smiling at something.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay looks like the rainbow reflection has gotten all their attention&quot; she said, as a multi colored Deena could be seen skipping along the front lawn, the other magical girls desperately chasing her more towards the backyard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The real Deena slowly popped out of the bushes, looking rather ragged with bits of her attire torn up as she quickly shook away some leaves.  &quot;Finally&quot; she muttered, taking out her wand as light quickly bathed it, fixing her attire up.  &quot;That took forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s what happens when you try saying goodbye three times to so many of your devoted followers&quot; Gale pointed out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena sighed.  &quot;I really shouldn&#39;t of offered second hugs but they looked so hopeful and pleading and&quot; she looked away.  &quot;Ugh, I have to figure something out.  I mean, their biggest reward is my love and devotion which I want to get to them but... you know in a way that doesn&#39;t take hours to sort through.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out&quot; Gale said giving her a thumbs up.  &quot;Or maybe when you take to Milly he&#39;ll come up with something.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At this point either option I&#39;m cool with&quot; Deena crossed her arms.  &quot;When we meet up again to take over the school, I&#39;ll contact you to gather the others.  Until then, you&#39;re in charge of constructing home base.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gale Force nodded.  &quot;No problem Deena&quot; she said, rolling her hand.  &quot;Any specific look you had in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Any look YOU have in mind&quot; Deena smirked some.  &quot;You&#39;re the artist after all so even if you don&#39;t get to make a major out of it in college, you can flex those creative ideas into construction and what not.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my expertise was more attire and sewing then house making really.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll still do good at it.  In fact, do good enough and I&#39;ll let you redesign any of the new recruit&#39;s uniforms and appearances to be however you see their personas and designs match up.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gale squealed happily.  &quot;Oooh now that&#39;s incentive&quot; she said before saluting.  &quot;I promise to complete that objective best as I can, Matriarch Deena.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Please just call me Deena&quot; the lead magical girl said, knocking her head.  &quot;I get the matriarch label from near everyone else, so being able to talk to someone more normally is a much appreciated change of pace.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing&quot; Gale then waved off.  &quot;Have a save trip then.  Once you&#39;ll gone I&#39;ll have Shields make a barrier around this place so no one else can spot it and then we can set to work on the actual construction.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, good planning ahead.  Knew there was a... sixth reason I&#39;m leaving you in charge&quot; the two laughed at this a bit as Deena extended a rainbow out.  &quot;Come along Fioara we have places to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maid Fioara quickly lept out of the bush Deena was in, bowing politely.  &quot;Of course Mistress Deena&quot; she said obeditantly as Gale watched the young Maid hold onto Deena tightly, the magical matriarch quickly rushing along the bridge as it started disappearing behind them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gale looked up a bit impressed.  &#39;Gee never thought a Silvers would be so happy leaving their home to serve someone else&#39; she thought, looking at herself and around.  &#39;Then again, never though any of this would happen today.&#39;  She then smiled some.  &#39;And it&#39;s up to me to make the most of it.&#39;  She then rushed over, using her wind powers to speed along the ground as the rainbow mirage of Deena slowly started fizzling out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the  real Deena was shown jumping down the rainbow, appearing with Fioara in front of her home.  &quot;Well here we are&quot; she said, taking the young Maid&#39;s hand as they quickly walked through the lawn and up to the front door.  Deena tried opening it, noticing it was locked as she grumbled some.  &quot;Damn stupid lock&quot; she muttered, trying to look through the curtain of the nearby window.  &quot;Can&#39;t see anyone so I&#39;ll just use the key...&quot; she then felt around her dress some.  &quot;oh right...&quot; she then smirked.  &quot;Then again, who needs a key when you have this?&#39; she then spun her scepter, a small rainbow appearing from it to open the locked door.  &quot;Ah there we go&quot; she said, dragging herself and Fioar in as she then closed the door behind them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is... this is m-my new home mistress?&quot; Fioara politely asked, looking around the dirty kitchen, which had the dirty dishes from the breakfast and several other meals along a level of grime on the floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That it is dear&quot; Deena then knelt down and gently kissed her forehead.  &quot;You know what that means right?&quot; Fioara nodded, doing a formal curtsey as she quickly let go of Deena and ran to a nearby closet, taking out a dust pan and broom as she quickly got to work sweeping the floor, humming a quiet tune to herself.  &quot;That&#39;s my girl&quot; Deena said, crossing her arms a proud smile on her face.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The one you brought home anyway&quot; Deena turned to see Milly fly in the room.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Cat Bro&quot; Deena said, turning back to look at Fioara clean up.  &quot;How goes things on the home front?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Marissa and Patricia are still resting so I&#39;ve been observing the findings in our little cave area&quot; Milly said, frowning some.  &quot;Honestly my area of expertise is deciphering the info the cosmos in general gives about our mission.  Views and Observers are much better at deciphering more up to the moment NeFiend spotting and recruitment areas.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m sure you still found something worth discussing&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as much as your finds&quot; Milly then focused on Fioara still hard at work cleaning the kitchen, narrowing his eyes some.  &quot;Thankfully this seems to be the only truly selfish gain.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Pffft hey we&#39;re going to need maid units&quot; Deena pointed out.  &quot;If we&#39;re busy training up for actual action someone&#39;s gotta do the cooking and cleaning right? So why not make some help for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we weren&#39;t going to fight today so you could of done that yourself-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This works better&quot; Deena then pointed over at Fioara.  &quot;Plus it&#39;s not like it&#39;s torture for them or anything.  They clearly enjoy it&quot; Fioara was still smiling as she went about her work.  &quot;And really that&#39;s a bigger genuine grin then Alyssa ever gave about anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly blinked some.  &quot;Wait you transformed Alyssa into your maid?&quot; Milly crossed his arms.  &quot;I thought you were over that crush.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah cause I totally want to do a cute 12 year old girls who thinks of me as her mother figure&quot; Deena sarcastically noted.  &quot;This is just a way of using... what&#39;s a nice word for jerks who abused others in their former lives?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... I meant a more general term.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Problematic people.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, getting the more problematic people a point in our cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The cat familiar focused on Fioara continuing to clean and sighed.  &quot;Well I guess if she is happy and you aren&#39;t abusing her, I shouldn&#39;t complain about it&quot; Milly started flying away from the kitchen as Deena followed him.  &quot;Especially since that first hot spot of yours was a rather impressive find&quot; we then saw the two walking down the hallway, heading down into the Cave area Deena had created yesterday night.  &quot;We&#39;ve gone to a mere band of four to now having a Maid, 39 Views with 39 Observe Partners, 82 Shields, 70 Lances, 60 Healers, 62 Casters, and heck even one of the seven Color Guards.  That alone should be worth celebrating.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena blinked a few times.  &quot;Wait, Color Guard? What do you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Millly looked at Deena confused.  &quot;What do you mean what do I mean? You Found and transformed Color Guard Indigo.  I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d find one of them for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... still don&#39;t know what that means.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay well of the three hundred and fifty four people there, wasn&#39;t there one that you transformed differently from everyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena thought for a second and snapped her fingers.  &quot;Ohhhh yeah I saw Abagail Presslin there.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Abagail? Wasn&#39;t that the art girl you picked on a lot?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that was so last life cat bro.  Now she&#39;s a member of the team though...&quot; Deena recalled Abagail transforming into Gale Force having a similar outfit to hers and a scepter that could transform others.  &quot;Yeah she was the only one to have similar powers to mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because she&#39;s one of the Color Guard&quot; Milly explained, the two now in the cave, Deena sitting in one of the chairs, with Milly floating next to her.  &quot;Though there are still many different types of magical girl left to make, the rarest will be the Color Guard, your elite unit.  Ones who actually have to AGREE to the transformation and in turn, obtain similar powers to yours and can make others to transform as well.&quot;  Milly flicked his tail.  &quot;Though not as strong as a Matriarch, only a Color Guard can organize and take over the army if you are somehow slain, though you are still the only one who can find/change the other six.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, didn&#39;t know that&quot; Deena admitted, leaning back in the chair.  &quot;Truthfully, I just realized I was a jerk to Abigail, and wanted her to at least know what she was going to be a part of.  Didn&#39;t expect her to want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, Color Guards are incredibly rare&quot; Milly pointed to Deena.  &quot;Again technically you only agreed to this power accidently.  Something that won&#39;t happen with pretty much anyone else.  Which is the reason why for 99% of the cases you really need to transform first, ask questions never.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena shrugged.  &quot;Well you never know right? Some people could want to join of their own volition.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Milly rolled his eyes.  &quot;We&#39;ve been over this.  The reason this is a FORCED RECRUITMENT is because not enough will on their own.  You can&#39;t waste time looking around trying to pick and choose certain people when the whole world&#39;s at stake Deena.  This isn&#39;t a case where the enemy is just going to wait around or when they do strike, just attack with one monster per battle and wait to see if it&#39;s defeated or not.  You&#39;re going to have to potentially fight hundreds upon thousands of these beasts when the war truly begins, which means-&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m going to need as many as I can get&quot; Deena saigh with a sigh.  &quot;I know I know, can&#39;t underestimate the enemy or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Right&quot; Milly pointed at Deena with his tail.  &quot;You also can&#39;t just blindly trust the one in a million who agree to this either.  The people who join the color guard don&#39;t have the automatic super loyalty to you and only you as the rest of the magic girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Which no offense or anything isn&#39;t the worse thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But it also means they think independently which could be a deterent if they defy you in battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll pick more carefully&quot; Deena said, resting her hands behind her back.  &quot;Honestly I trust Gale.  She&#39;s helpful and polite and  no offense or anything, practical without being a total buzz kill about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I try and give you the harsh facts&quot; Milly said with some bitter sarcasm.  &quot;I just don&#39;t want you recruiting people into the elite who could prove more a hinderance then help.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries about that&quot; Deena patted her chest proudly.  &quot;I&#39;m working to make sure my family&#39;s safe as much as I can too.  Be it the memories I keep of their former lives, or the sisters I have now.  I&#39;ll rise up to protect whoever needs my help.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
