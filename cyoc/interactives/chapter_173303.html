<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was looking around the park when he noticed a boy drinking water from a fountain. He thought that it was a good opportunity to test his new powers. So, he started to watch him from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
Matt was a short 11 years old boy with chesnut brown hair and green eyes. He wasn&#39;t very athletic but he liked to play in the park in front of his home everyday because his parents used to work until very late and he ended up with his older brother for several hours.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t like his brother at all. Being 7 years older than him, Matt&#39;s brother didn&#39;t have anything in common with him. Matt liked watching cartoons, playing video games and singing while his brother liked cars, wrestling and smoking. Also, his brother loved to show off and walk in underwear around their home. That was really disgusting for Matt, he didn&#39;t like to see his brother&#39;s bushy armpits and hairy legs all day. But what he disliked completely was seeing his brother&#39;s meat swaying inside his dirty boxers when he walked.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, none of Matt&#39;s friends lived close to his home. So, playing in the park was his only way to escape from his brother. That day, he found a group of 14 year old boys playing with a ball who invited him to join them. He usually was very shy with unfamiliar people but they looked very kind, so he accepted.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t expect that their friendly game turned very intense. So ended up playing for more hours than he expected. He noticed it very late and hurried up to return to his home. However, his brother was already looking for him, he seemed quite angry and was yelling at Matt like a crazy.<br />
<br />
Matt knew that if his brother found him in the park, he would take a beating, so he tried to sneak out of him behind a few bushes. But he unfortunately tripped and fell in front of his brother. Also, his shirt ripped off leaving his torso exposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking pipsqueak? That you can escape from me? Ha!!&quot; Matt&#39;s brother shouted as he grabbed his little brother by his neck with a hand. &quot;Your so pathetic that trying to show off those inexistent muscles is an insult for the ones who work hard to get biceps like this&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was getting troubles to breath when Ty decided that he had seen enough. Normally, a kind person would be emphatic to Matt, but Ty wasn&#39;t that emphatic. So, he thought that he could get some fun from these brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, I&#39;m gonna freeze the time.&quot; Ty thought and immediately everything stopped moving, even the birds in the sky. &quot;Excellent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without a need to be hidden, Ty approached to the frozen brothers and looked at them closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big guy and little kid.&quot; Ty said. &quot;It would be too easy to swap their roles but I think I would do something else instead. First. Let&#39;s take their clothes off.&quot; Both Matt and his brother got nude in the middle of the park. Ty noticed that Matt was completely undeveloped while his brother was a perfect description of testosterone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see if Matt will reach his brother in a few years.&quot; Ty thought and made them 5 years older. Matt&#39;s brother barely changed, he got hairier and bulkier if you watched him carefully. But Matt, he was a complete different person.<br />
<br />
The small and fragile kid was replaced by a tall and lean teen boy who has nothing to envy to his old brother. He even was a little bit taller, so the strangling scene seemed weird right now. Ty just smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that I can make age progression but what about some sex change.&quot; Ty thought and immediately both young men started to turn into women. Ty watched how Matt and his brothers dicks and balls retreated and became clits. Their short haircuts turned longer, their thick pecs became big boobs and their body hair (Matt had finally got some) dissappeared, except on their crotches where it just got way more smaller and trimmed.<br />
<br />
So, now Ty was watching two women, one at 16 while the other 23 fighting in a very manly pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good. But I think that I liked them more as men.&quot; Ty thought and the last transformation reverted and Matt and his brother became male again. Ty was still impressed that this hairy and strong guy was the weak 11 years old Matt a moment ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s quite a stud now.&quot; Ty said and without meant it, Matt started to change once again. His already fit muscles became so big that he looked like a pro bodybuilder whose neck was so thick that his brother can&#39;t circle it anymore. &quot;Oops, I didn&#39;t want to do that... but now that it happened I don&#39;t complain. He looks better now.&quot; Ty kept looking at Matt&#39;s new self. &quot;But those big muscles had made his dick to look tiny in comparison.&quot; Ty thought as he glanced at Matt&#39;s newly grown manhood. &quot;I got an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt dick and balls began to swell like balloons until they&#39;re as big as a cucumber and two canteloupes. Matt&#39;s brother&#39;s dick now looked tiny in comparison. So, Ty decided to match his to Matt&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha! They look ridiculous!&quot; Ty laughed and then he got another idea. Matt and his brother&#39;s skin started to get pale, the hair on their heads turned blue and orange, respectively. Ty smiled as he watched their noses turning big and red, and their feet became so big and clumsy that they arched down a little. Now, they looked like clowns. &quot;This power is awesome, but I think it&#39;s enough of playing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty materialized some clothes on the brothers. Of course, it was clown clothing. When the huge size 24 shoes appeared on their feet, Ty unfreezed the time and everything started to move again. Now, Matt and his brother were a pair of clowns making a comical show in the park. Some people were laughing and watching the show while they faked a fight like in a circus.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems that I can alter reality.&quot; Ty thought and then he wanted to try his powers without freezing time, he just wished that everybody was unaware. Matt and his brother began to swell, this time so much and so fast that they resembled two giant balls in no time. Then, their pale color skin started to turn blue. &quot;I love Willy Wonka&quot; Ty said as he watched two giant blueberries in the middle of the park. People suddenly rushed toward them and started to devour Matt and his brother&#39;s fruity bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this is too much.&quot; Ty snapped his fingers and everything came back to normal. Well, almost everything. Because Matt and his brother&#39;s body had merged into one. They had the body of a college man, so Matt&#39;s face had age to match it. Ty smiled when he noticed that they weren&#39;t fighting anymore. So, it was a happy ending, at least for Ty who walked away.</p>
