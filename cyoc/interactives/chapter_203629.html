<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What if he leaves me like this?” Rusty had asked as Troy opened the front door.  Troy didn’t have an answer for him.<br />
<br />
RK’s threat to just walk away was perhaps the most frightening one he could have made.  Troy could accept her new lot in life.  In the same way that she had just accepted the switch in sexuality to become her former best friend’s new boyfriend, she also found it surprisingly easy to accept the idea of now being the mother to his child.  That being said, Troy couldn’t accept what had been done to Rusty – whether it be as his wife, gay boyfriend, his best friend, or even just as his owner, Troy couldn’t leave Rusty in his current situation.  And that meant taking the threat of RK walking away seriously.  <br />
<br />
Troy had no idea how long it would be until she went into labor, but the feeling of the baby’s head pressing down into the center of her pelvis made it apparent that she was a couple of day away at most.  And if RK had been able to know the exact timing of her false contraction, it stood to reason that her water breaking would be the queue for RK to abandon Troy and Rusty to their fates.  That didn’t mean that Troy had given up yet – she still had until the end of her driveway to come up with a plan, but it had already been an hour and she couldn’t chance waiting any longer.<br />
<br />
Her plan right now was to walk as slowly as she could.  Which wasn’t to say that she was planning on giving any sort of grand acting performance.  Her heart and lungs were both working for two people and she was exhausted.  Just walking from the bathroom to the front door had caused her to begin panting.  And all of this was ignoring just how uncomfortable it was to have a squirming, 8 pound ball of flesh bouncing around inside of her with every step.<br />
<br />
So she would take her time walking to the end of the driveway, as any 9 month pregnant woman was entitled to do, all while doing her best to locate RK to cast a spell on him.  And she knew just what she was going to do to him when she found him.  <br />
<br />
First, she’d turn him into a rooster.  Then, once she got the Book of Body, she’d change him from a rooster to hen.  Then, at minimum, she’d taunt the new hen as it laid its first egg.  And who knows what kind of spells the Book of Body would have?  Troy pictured RK spending the rest of his life as a small hen, laying a half dozen ostrich eggs each day, struggling in agony to get them out of her tiny body.  She sincerely hoped the Book of Body had something in it that would let her do that to him.  Something to make him spend the rest of his life suffering for what he had done to Rusty and her.<br />
<br />
Then again, Troy was fully aware that it was unlikely that she would be able to locate RK before she reached the end of the driveway.  So what then?  Could she really trust RK?  She knew that she might not have a choice.<br />
<br />
Troy stepped out of the front door, slowly plodding down the walkway with one arm cupping her stomach while the other cupped her breasts – that wasn’t for show, by taking slow, deliberate steps and supporting both aspects of her new anatomy, Troy was able to greatly minimize the amount of bouncing and significantly improve her own comfort. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Troy, so was so busy scanning for RK – and imagining the torment she would inflict on him - that she didn’t notice as the black stripes in her fur began to enlarge.  By the time she had made it to the corner of garage, all her orange fur had been replaced with black while her tail began to puff out to the sides.  Two thin white stripes formed on the tip of her nose and moved up to the top of her head before begging to run down her back, meeting at the base of her tail, then diverging again as they headed towards it tip.<br />
<br />
The first indication that anything was wrong came as Troy felt two, sharp pinching sensations next to her ass, followed by two swelling sensations – each behind one of the pinches.  The discomfort in her rear caused her to try to instinctively empty whatever was forming behind her, but she couldn’t find the muscles to do so.  She just felt them swell more and more until it felt like she was… leaking?  <br />
<br />
Before she could ponder the situation any further, Troy felt her eyes swell up while her nose tried to pull itself shut and her throat begin to gag as all three were simultaneously invaded by an overpowering stench of rancid garlic and death.  At the same time, Troy felt a sudden feeling of wetness “down there.”<br />
<br />
Fear flooded her mind, had her water just broken?  There wasn’t much wetness and it felt too far back…  Troy took the hand that was previously cradling the bottom of her stomach and moved it down.  Running her fingers over her vagina revealed that it was dry – thank god – so she moved her hand further back.  As her fingers brushed over her asshole she felt two small, new holes positioned to the side of each, with a thick, oily substance coming from them.<br />
<br />
Lifting her finger up to her nose, a quick sniff informed her of just how bad of a mistake that had been – a tidal wave of pure stench flooded into her nose, bursting every flood gate that her body had available before washing over her brain.  It was like her entire existence was a swirling cesspool of fetid swamp gas.  <br />
<br />
She felt herself begin to lean over, all while her stomach tried to escape through her mouth as she began to dry heave.  She whipped her hand away from her nose and brought it down to her knee.  That helped to both lessen the smell and support her upper body as she continued gagging on, what she realized, was her own smell.<br />
<br />
She was thankful that she hadn’t eaten yet today so there was nothing to throw up and while the dry heaves faded after a few seconds, the stench did not.  Now leaning slightly forward, she caught sight of her own stomach hanging out in front of her.  In place of her usual soft, shiny orange and black stiped pelt was a mass of dull, coarse black fur that was matted with… mud?  Looking behind her, she saw the two white stripes running down the middle of a wide, floofy, black tail.<br />
<br />
She was a skunk?  How was that possible?  She was still holding the Book of Beast under her left arm and she hadn’t cast a spell.<br />
<br />
A kick from her stomach reminded her of the baby inside, and a quick squeeze of her abdominal muscles revealed that everything was still “normal” there.  <br />
<br />
But then there were those two feelings of pressure next to her ass.  If she was a skunk then those were her spray glands.  But even though they were full to the point that she was leaking spray onto her own ass, she couldn’t spray them on her own.  It was like the muscles just didn’t exist.</p>
