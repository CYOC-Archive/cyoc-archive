<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John didn’t know who leaned in first and neither did Reina but within moments, Reina’s book was forgotten and her hand was now up against his cheek. Then their foreheads touched and their heart rates picked up. Then almost shaking in excitement because of how long she had wanted to do this, she cupped his chin and pulled him into a kiss. She wouldn’t even have attempted this is John was still with his now ex-girlfriend, she wasn’t that type of woman but the game had changed.<br />
<br />
John wasn’t a virgin and neither was she but something just felt so different now, maybe it the virus but an almost electric feeling was going through both of their bodies and they both seamed to feel hotter and this all came from a kiss. Reina’s hands moved, the one which had been cupping John’s chin had moved back to his cheek and every so often would go exploring into his short dirty blonde hair. Her other hand guided one of John’s hands to her hip letting it rub against the side of her breast. She didn’t want to take it too far but still wanted him to know she was ok having him touch her in certain spots. <br />
<br />
For John this was developing way to fast but on some levels,  he really liked it, he didn’t want to push it but then he smelled it. It was the most erotic smell he had ever imagined, and he could feel his manhood hardening like it never had before under his shorts. Reina smelled it too, and she couldn’t place a finger on it but whatever it was it was making her unbelievably wet and she was ready to go all the way. She was about to stand up to take this to the floor and to hell with anything else when her hand went up into John’s hair and slammed into a large lump which hadn’t been there moments before. She pulled back her hand trailing a little blood but it wasn’t her blood. She looked at the blood and then back up at John.<br />
<br />
For John he was confused he didn’t want it to stop when suddenly he felt it a monster of a headache and pain in his head. He also looked at Reina’s hand to see small amounts of blood. He reached up to spot on his head where the pain was an felt two large bumps growing out of his skull and the bumps had bone like structure sticking out of the flesh. <br />
<br />
“Ah…does sex or even the attempt of sex make the virus work faster?” inquired John<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t know.” Admitted Reina as before her eyes the bonny growths kept growing spitting off into the start of a pair of antlers. <br />
<br />
Now Reina couldn’t see it but it wasn’t just John who was changing her bandana fell away to show two rounded ears poking out of the red hair, the ears now had black tips and rich brown fur around it. Short thin snow white fur also began coming in around her eyes and mouth while her nose turned black.<br />
<br />
“Reina you changed too.” Said John as both of them reached for their phones and did a search on the internet. They both found the answer at almost the same time. “You have got to be kidding me!&quot;<br />
<br />
“It says that hormones released while having sex or being simply aroused can speed up the transformation process. Therefor it isn’t recommended for a transforming person to have sex while transforming because of risk of harm to them or their partner.” Read Reina as she tossed her phone down. “You think that they would have warned us about that.”<br />
<br />
“You would think.” Said John as he still tried to fight the need to do Reina, the smell was causing him to think that maybe it was worth becoming whatever he was becoming to do Reina. Then he really took note of what Reina’s changes looked like. “Ah…what are you becoming?”<br />
<br />
“Best guess a White Tail Deer furry but it could be any Deer furry really.” Answered Reina as she noticed the changes in John. “My God…your becoming the same, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, no gender change.” added John, he wasn’t sure if some female deer species had antlers or not.<br />
<br />
“Same here…I am staying a woman.” confirmed Reina, she had to fight down a smile, maybe fate was playing her a good hand after all. John the man she had loved in secret for years had broken up with his girlfriend and was becoming the same furry monster as she was. <br />
<br />
“I guess…it is fate.” Added John, it wasn’t fur sure that they where the same type of deer, he could be an elk or a mouse and she could be a deer or antelope but they were the same type of furry. “So how do we explain this to my family and the doctors?”<br />
<br />
“Well…they didn’t really tell us about the whole speed up thing but it is going to be weird to say the least.” Confirmed Reina with a blush.</p>
