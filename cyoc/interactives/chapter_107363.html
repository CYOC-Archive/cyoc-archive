<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A group of scientists, specializing in high school stereotypes, entered a nearby local college as teachers in order to correct those who seemed to be out of what society perceives of their true stereotype.<br />
<br />
They had a few eyes on certain students who seemed to be acting &quot;out of the ordinary&quot;. A few of them being inside this particular class full of &quot;original liberals&quot; or so they&#39;ve described.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
In College , Travis had always exceeded everyone&#39;s expectations of him. Being an athletic man whom participated in several school&#39;s competitions, while still being committed to his studies and helping others in need. <br />
<br />
He was a polite, well-mannered gentleman. Not a brute, but a lean and fit jock with a moderate amount of muscle from working out. Not too brash or show offy although people do give him glances from time to time. A wonderful personality and body for a handsome guy.<br />
<br />
Everyone, even majority of the nerds , goths and loners liked him. He was quite intelligent, being able to maintain and score above 3.0 for all his semesters despite his competitive classmates.<br />
<br />
The Fraternity that he joined however, was something else...rather, quite what you would expect of a stereotype. Then again, he knew that there would always be frat boys in college.<br />
<br />
Dumb bros who get away being complete douchebags to their victims, narcissistic brainless jocks who only care about sports, sex and beer. <br />
<br />
Travis fantasized about these traits.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Travis thought that was hot, being one of them, a fraternity brother, but he valued his moral values and politeness. He did look the part...sorta, handsome in a refreshing sort of way, but never carried the overwhelming boisterous atmosphere like a bro would.<br />
<br />
Extremely straight and heterosexual jocks. Flirting with and fucking chicks all night at the frat house. The College man was gay to be one of them. Although most of the others were homophobic as shit, misogynist assholes.<br />
<br />
Dumb homophobes of America, Murica. Travis was excited with college frats originally before realizing it may affect him in the log run. As slowly throughout his freshmen year, he appeared less and less in the frat dorms and opted bunking with a nerd buddy from high school, Castor<br />
<br />
Plus, Not wanting the other bro&#39;s influence to cause him to drop in his studies or rub the wrong way with any of his friends. <br />
<br />
After many talks, he decided that he should leave today, after the party. Although, with that decision, comes a heavy life changing consequence as the scientists found out about this.<br />
<br />
Some of the scientists were his teachers for a few weeks and did heavy stalking and research and concluded that they needed to correct his mentality and personality, and thus immediately set out their plan in order to make him never want to leave his fraternity again.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Travis was chilling at his room, skyping his best friend Selene who was out in her Sorority, much to her dislike. Like him, she was a lesbian and really intelligent, being in the deans list with a near 4.0 GPA while being a cheerleader. <br />
<br />
Of course she despised being in the bimbo clique, but figured it was easier to get &quot;club points&quot; just by going for their events than leaving. She needed her &#39;portfolio&#39; after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, see ya. Gonna go for a stupid bimbotic swim party. Hope I don&#39;t end up a stupid hoe after tonight, haha.&quot; She joked, before signing off. <br />
<br />
Almost instantly as she left, the door bell BZZT! As Travis got off his seat, and went to his doorstep. Opened the door with a swoosh and there was no one being there except a medium sized box.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, he shut the door and brought the box to his room, opening it to find a SnapBack with his fraternity&#39;s Symbol on it. It was quite nice he admitted, despite the frat&#39;s stereotypical dumb nature, they had good style and design.<br />
<br />
A note reading &quot;BROSKI! Caps for Seniors! WEAR IT BEFORE COMING FOR THE PARTY!!!!!&quot; By the Frat President apparently, Year 2s like himself got it.<br />
<br />
He shrugged and thought &quot;Why not?&quot; Walking to the mirror and putting aside his old SnapBack. It was going to be his last day there anyways, might as well not put the stylish cap to waste.<br />
<br />
Looking himself in the mirror, he got dressed into a plain white wife beater and grey sweatpants combo like he always did to fit in with the man crowd. Although...,they do seem slightly larger than before...<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably the stretching and physical activities wore the material out.&quot; He shrugged, being of average height just slightly below 6ft. A lean, fit runner&#39;s build with an outline of abs, small pecs and average gym sized biceps. <br />
<br />
He had peachy skin, wishing for a tan despite his genetics. Sliding on a flannel buttoned down shirt in order to prevent himself from looking like a total show off. Sure he had nice arms but not as loaded or built like the Jocks.<br />
<br />
 Spotting a nice fuzzy beard, Brown hair flat and manly on his face and top, masculine features donning his facial features. He was content with his appearance. Although of course, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to get buffer in the future.<br />
<br />
He picked up the SnapBack, putting it normally on his head and not wanting to twist it unless it was necessary later at the frat house. As he looked into the contents of the box, he noticed another much smaller box within it.<br />
<br />
He opened and saw a pair of studded black men&#39;s stud earrings in it, pressed nicely in grey styrofoam. He took them out an examined it, noting it wasn&#39;t in the note or requirements to enter the party, thank god too.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t really saw the appeal of ear piercings and did not pierce his ears anyways. His real life &quot;broski&quot; in the room next door would probably give him shit for wearing those &quot;frat earnings&quot; like the other dumb jocks--POKE!<br />
<br />
&quot;AUGHHHHHHH!&quot; Travis pricked his finger, shouted loudly in response to the tremendous pain that came from picking up the earring. &quot;FUCKING DESIGN IS COMPLETE SHIT AND--!&quot;<br />
<br />
He covered his mouth in response to his vulgar and loud rudeness. Why was he getting so pissed off over jabbing his finger on a piece of metal? He wasn&#39;t even going to wear it anyway-though, maybe he should just put it in his pocket in case the Frat Prez questions him, dun wanna be like for the ceremony--<br />
<br />
&quot;AUUUUUUGHHHHH!&quot; He clenched his head in pain, crouching in front of the mirror as his eyes are beginning to spiral and sink. Vision blurry like that time he had a hang over yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? YESTERDAY?&quot; He clenched his mind even further, a great brain drain and memories blurring as he opened wide his mouth and groaned and Groaned and GROAAAANNNN.<br />
<br />
He started at the mirror with derpy eyes, as he felt the sides of beard shaving away with bristles left on those parts. Completely tripping out, as he continuously groaned louder and louder by the minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;My head...I&#39;ve gotta...I&#39;ve gotta...Its hurts...IT HURTS MAN!&quot;<br />
<br />
-SWOOSH-<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Castor came by, he was wearing his anime T-shirt and was a otaku despite not being as gross and obsessed as the Asians in the Anime Club in school.<br />
<br />
As Travis turned to the man on his left, he got up slowly while clenching his head. He stared at the taller male and felt a strong urge of dislike and hatred to the other guy, despite him feeling that they were friends before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay? You don&#39;t look too well?&quot;<br />
<br />
He rolled his shoulders and twisted his SnapBack slightly to the side out of a form of annoyance. His eyes glared as his put his fist into hand, which made him seem more menacing and bully like as he continued to do that.<br />
<br />
His nostrils flared as he felt his body STRETCCHING upward. Reaching close to the entire ceiling of the seemingly smaller room as he felt a flame cooking from within, like he has something against the other male in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OKAY!!!!????&quot; <br />
<br />
Travis spoke harshly , patience running thing. Losing respect and looking down upon the now shorter and more fearful looking male.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t look too WELL??!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was about to explode, the room banished itself into a storeroom as his former memories that linked him to his former friend Castor get bullied away. Why would the jock ever need concern from pathetic losers?<br />
<br />
He felt so cocky and proud of himself, cutting out ties to &quot;friends&quot; he never needed. In fact, these &quot;friends&quot; needed to be thought a lesson for not giving the jocks enough respect around here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen dweeb, either you shut your fucking mouth and do my fucking homework for the rest of the semester.&quot; He threatened, as his skin darkened to a perfect tan like his true broskis at the party.<br />
<br />
He sucked at school, couldn&#39;t give the basic shit about it even at a basic level. Resorting in threatening and bullying others so that he didn&#39;t fail in the shit he&#39;s studying. <br />
<br />
Instead of a protective and welcoming person, Travis grabbed the nerd by the collar and shoved him to the nearby wall with one hand. It being much larger and rougher than it was ever before.<br />
<br />
His body getting more built by the minute as time formerly spent on studying gets shoved to partying and football practice. He hated reading books, he wasn&#39;t no nerd! He was a FUCKING jock for GODAMN sake.<br />
<br />
Pictures of Travis and Castor fading away as a load of undone assignments got piled on top of the living room table. The room becoming a single dormitory, paid extra so the nerd didn&#39;t had to risk bunking in with a bully, though that didn&#39;t stop Travis from coming often.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get these done by tomorrow nerd! Or ELSE IM GONNA BEAT THE LIVING SHIT OUTTA YOU!&quot; He tossed him aside onto the floor, and scorned at his favorite victim.<br />
<br />
Clenching his fist as he grabbed his duffel bag at the corner of the dorm, swaggering out with his expanding feet and legs as they hit record high at a 6ft 3. <br />
<br />
Toughened thighs and way more masculine, huge feet from daily training, being fully committed to sports in college like he was in high school.<br />
<br />
He slipped on his size 18 basketball shoes that seemed new despite wearing them for over a year as he could recall...right? &quot;I dunno.&quot;  He shrugged, slipping on the pair like he couldn&#39;t give a shit about no socks, he went here just to check on his homework before the party right? <br />
<br />
&quot;Man couldn&#39;t think straight.&quot; He spoke, as thoughts became muddier than before. He felt the back of his head and felt tuffs of hair feeling fuller and bushier. He kinda liked it...yeah.<br />
<br />
Walking dizzily down the corridor, like a drunk man coming home after a late night party. He scratched his beard once more, the frontal part seemingly thicker than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just gotta think less, flex more.&quot; He mentioned, puffing out a chest as he heaved a long sigh, expanding his pectoral muscles as they inflated almost in an instant on his bare chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flex more...Flex more.&quot; He repeated, focusing on his body as thoughts became simpler and simpler. &quot;So easy to just focus on my strong bod...&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;s a hot stud for goodness sake, everyone fuckin respects him, and if they don&#39;t, he can just beat the LIVING SHIT! Out of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flex more...Flex--f-F-FUCK! FUCK!&quot; He tossed his constricting plaid shirt away. Leaving his large Wife beater hugging his powerful sexy torso, fitting and just appropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking shit clothes blocking my biceps for the world the see!&quot; POP! POP!POP! Six pack Abs popped out like a popcorn kernel, nicely firm and adjustable like his package.<br />
<br />
His thighs and knees swelled beneath those sweatpants, rooting themselves firmly to the ground as his ass solidified like a grown soldier, proud and patriotic to his country.<br />
<br />
 &quot;YEAH! THAT&#39;S more like IT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Voice echoing throughout campus, a deep yet bombastic tone that caught anyone&#39;s attention from a mile away. Always worked getting his and those dumbasses&#39; attention in the field. <br />
<br />
With a CROAK! And a &quot;GRRRRRAH!&quot; Bellowing out his man pride with a beastly roar. Melting away any gentleness as it toughened to a voice rivaling that of an army sergeant, with a thick prominent Adam&#39;s Apple to show his male identity.<br />
<br />
His IQ dropped further down beyond the depths of an average intelligence , pheromones and male primal urges filling up that emptying nogan that he had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, need fucking sex later tonight.&quot; He smirked, posing with his beefier arms to fuel his ego. Cockier and more arrogant by the minute. &quot;Gotta get to the frat, STAT!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that being said, Travis jogged comfortably but quickly to the frat. His body glistening with sweat and sexy narcissism as his brown hair puffed from the back of his head<br />
<br />
&quot;BOOM!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;BRAH! JUST IN TIME! BEER PONG!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bro-like man got into queue without question, playing it like he was a master at it. Being the one thing he didn&#39;t flunk in school. As he landed his final move, his Bros cheered as he chugged down a large can of beer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here comes a big one--&quot; the frat Brother prepared himself, diminishing any fear or dislike for the brotherhood that they shared.<br />
<br />
&quot;BURRRRRRRRP!&quot;Travis burped loudly , like he wasn&#39;t afraid of nothing , like he was the king of the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;AWESOME BROSKI!&quot; SLAP! A bro slapped a bandage over his nose without question. Travis looked dumbfounded before another hazing to his brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheeyah Broski!&quot; He fist pumped his brah, before flexing his even larger tanned bicep. He was such a popular dude with his Bros.<br />
<br />
<br />
Travis was a party animal, just like the other bros of his frat, having the time of their lives like every other party. He did go for every party, it was the only thing that made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;PLEDGE TIME BRAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Frat Prez, being a fucking stud, bellowed the frat pledge.<br />
<br />
Chilling, partying, working out is LIFE!<br />
<br />
&quot;Chilling, partying, working out is LIFE!&quot; <br />
He pumped his fist in the air and exaggerated his dumb deep voice.<br />
<br />
Life in college is swag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life in college is swag.&quot; <br />
 A full on scholarship just by joining a frat, engaged in sports and passing his exams, man it was easy! Though all the math and science wasn&#39;t his kind of shit.<br />
<br />
All he needed to do was beat a couple of fags and get them doing his assignments and he&#39;d be cruising with D&#39;s and C&#39;s. His GPA sucked being barely at 2.0, but--<br />
<br />
 Who needs grades when you got guns like these baby!<br />
<br />
 &quot;Who needs grades when you got guns like these baby!&quot; Tanner flexed his huge bicep next to the dumb blonde as she felt it with her soft and delicate features which really attracted the bro. <br />
<br />
&quot;GO AND FUCK EM CHICKS DUDEEEES!&quot;<br />
<br />
YEAH!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...Uhhhhhh?&quot; Travis questioned himself, &quot;I mean I like dicks right? Uhhh but why do I wanna fuck girls so badly huh?&quot; Travis wondered internally, flexing his biceps and bouncing his pecs to lower the stress that comes with thinking. <br />
<br />
&quot;What am I talkin about?&quot; He thought, noticing the guys each taking a sorority chick stationed at the side, winking at the hetero hunks as one by one, they followed a man to their respective Greek labeled dorms. &quot;Of course I dig THE LADEHS!&quot; <br />
<br />
Exaggerating the final word, dick already filling up, he pushed his cap all the way to the back as he placed his hands into his pockets-&quot;Huhuh? What&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
He questioned, opening the box. &quot;THATS WHERE MY STUDS HAVE BEEN!&quot; He exclaimed, recognising their distinct pattern, popping them into his pierced ears. &quot;Dudeee, what would I do without em---?<br />
<br />
He stopped midspeech and held his head. Surroundings all mixed up and wobbly like a drunken reality change , feeling all hazed and stoked momentarily before everything was set back into place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man...my mind feels like crap dude...&quot; He opted it&#39;s be better to just get drunk and chill for the day. as a door flung open with a beautiful gorgeous blonde drenched and dressed in her swim wear walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man that chick is hot.&quot; Travis smirked to himself, as his movements developed a grand over-exaggerated swagger like how he recalled his bros would do to attract babes. &quot;Huhuh? Bros? Yeah am one of em.&quot;<br />
<br />
Testosterone filling up his jock balls and huge dick as he thought about how sexy he looked and how he&#39;s gonna pound that girl tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s how they attract chicks right...just walk up to em.&quot; Travis spoke before he chuckle dumber and dumber than before. &quot; Huhuhu what am I saying? Of course I know what the ladies like, I ain&#39;t no fucking faggot huhuhuh--urp!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
He wrapped his muscular, body builder like arm around her chest.  Big meaty fingers already invading the girl&#39;s tits from under her swimsuit, like the womanizer he is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again, she would&#39;ve probably would&#39;ve attracted any frat guy in sight with her slender petite frame, super model looks and boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heyyyy stud~&quot; &quot;I&#39;m Samantha.&quot; She spoke in a seductive , bimbotic voice. Introducing in one line as the brash frat bro lead her to his frat dorm. <br />
<br />
The trashy looking hoe undressed herself and giggled like a brainless twit once more with her ass and tits exposed for the douchebag to see <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Containing messed up piles of clothes exploded everywhere, beer cans tossed to the corner and a bed containing numerous panties and bras scattered about. <br />
<br />
Samantha felt a little more sexy than the rest. Almost as though she was a goddess of sex or something. She looked drunk as fuck and was down to her underwear, before wiggling her curvaceous hips and exposing her sweet ass for the world to see. <br />
<br />
Instinctively, he threw his wife beater aside, tossed away his sweatpants and basketball shoes. Stripping away his massive Calvin Klein Boxers and revealing his long, huge dick. <br />
<br />
Throb. &quot;Hey Babe~&quot; He dived onto the bed, noticing her every feature as <br />
<br />
Throb! &quot;Man, she&#39;s a keeper!&quot; He thought, maybe it was her pussy, her cup size or just the way she looked at him. <br />
<br />
THROB! &quot;Whatever! She&#39;s hot as fuck! definitely gonna pound her every weekend!&quot;<br />
<br />
On a full hard on for the chick as his heterosexual self is about to take over and--THROB! THRUST!<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOOOOOaaaaahhhh~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH THATS RIGHT! MOAN FOR ME BABY!&quot; Tanner howled, as loud as his other bros on a full moon. Not like some pansy ass fag but like A REAL MAN!<br />
<br />
His powerful dick pounding into her, dominating over her like the fraternity jock he&#39;s meant to be. Aggressively with his overwhelming masculinity.<br />
<br />
Feeling her soft and humungous boobs and slim build sent him to overdrive. She would moan like the other chicks he had in bed before, no one can resist the D! <br />
<br />
&quot;DAMN! HOME SWEET HOME BABY!&quot; Tanner bellowed in extreme cockiness, like this is where he belonged.  He knows all the chicks want him, he was a jock, a frat bro, and OF COURSE THEY WANT HIM! <br />
<br />
A bully, frat boy, And only trophy bimbos like the sorority chicks next door can ever satisfy his hetero, straight urges. A dumb manly man, a jock bro.<br />
<br />
An alpha Male.</p>
