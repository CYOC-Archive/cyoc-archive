<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">you soon came to a decision and decided to do what the clerk wanted you to do as you chose two chores. you did reminded yourself that it was for the suit you wanted. you told the shop clerk on what shop chores you wanted to do to lower the price of the anthro tiger costume that's wearing a blue speedo from $75.<br />
<br />
<br />
"well, I guess I can do work at the cashier while I do some cleaning in the rooms of the changing areas. i'll even put the costumes and other things that are in there where they each belong to when you go on your lunch break. I can do some deliveries after words once you're done with your lunch break that I can get started as soon as your ready. i'm ready if you are." you said that the shop clerk looked at the clock as it was 11:30.<br />
<br />
"well, since you're eager to start your job for the day that my lunch break started a half an hour ago." the shop clerk started to say that you immediately started to clean the changing rooms as there were a bunch of costumes in there. some of them were anime costumes like a renamon as there were others, like a lion wearing a gladiator uniform<br />
, a black dragon outfit, even a french skunk maid as there were also stains on the wall that maybe the maid costume might be able to clean it up faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
the shop clerk then told you something about each of your jobs you were going to do. "but if your going to work at the cashier while I go on my lunch break while also cleaning the changing rooms and putting the costumes and other things where they each go that I forgot to mention something about the job condition you'll be working in." the clerk said that when you grab hold of the skunk maid is when the clerk fingers snapped.<br />
<br />
"yeah, and what's that?" you said as the suit came to life on you. it soon was on you that it wasn't long till you were a french skunk maid. "if you're going to do chore number 2, you'll have to wear one of our special maid costumes." the clerk said as you tried to hide being a girl skunk. just as you were about to say something is when the clerk ordered you to clean the changing rooms, put the costumes away nicely, and work at the cashier while the clerk was out on lunch break that by instinct, you did as you were told and continued to clean the changing room while putting away the stuff nicely away.<br />
<br />
once the costumes and the other stuff were put away in which were in the changing rooms is when you quickly grabbed a sponge and a bucket of soap and water and started cleaning the stains off the wall. looking at them more closely that they were semans as you were very soon starting to like some of them off. it took you 30 minutes to get you to realize what you were doing, but by the time you did is when you completely licked the seman off the walls. tilting a bit of your new white hair back behind your ear that you didn't knew where that experience came from as you blush about it. you quickly put that thought aside and immediately cleaned the rooms that it took you less time to clean it all up.<br />
<br />
looking at the clock as it said 12:15 that you soon headed over to the cashier and started working your second half of the chore. feeling good about helping customers when they come in and buying some costumes as most of them walked out while wearing the outfits they pick out that it was about three o'clock till the clerk cam back. seeing how the clerk was pleased with your chore that the clerk's fingers snapped again, only this time, the suit came off as you were now holding it in your arms.<br />
<br />
"I see you did well with that chore, now it time to do some deliveries." the clerk said while taking the suit off your hands and putting it into a box with an address on it to someone on the street. "and would you know it, your first delivery wants this suit. as for your discount for your suit, it went down 15 dollars and 50 cents."<br />
<br />
"thanks. so, is there a condition for this job to while doing some deliveries?" you asked the clerk that a smile was soon showing.<br />
<br />
"yes. now that you mention it, there is a few condition for this job.<br />
<br />
1.) you'll have to ride a bike to each address and wait there till some one answers. once answered, they will be singing their signature on each sheet for their delivery package. if they don't answer, or if no one is their, then i'll have to do it the old fashion way and send it through mail.<br />
<br />
2.) like the job you were doing before, you'll be in suit of mien. i'll even let you choose what outfit you'll be wear while on the job. your delivery service ends at 10 at night that you return here to return the suit for the night.<br />
<br />
if the price is still to big for you that you can do it again tomorrow and work it off. are you ok with that?" the clerk said as you soon went over to the costume ales before yell the clerk was also going to be hand you a mail uniform for which outfit you choose on. carefully looking at each one as you heard what the clerk said that the clerk also said on holding your tiger costume with a blue speedo on is when one outfit caught eye on what you wanted to wear for your second job.<br />
<br />
(what costume did you pick out for your delivery chore?)</p>
