<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily looked to the audience and was searching for some volunteers to see who to pick. After looking around, she noticed someone poking up out of the crowd. As it turns out, it was a ten-year-old girl jumping up and down raising her hand with a woman by her side. Seeing that, she could tell that it was a mother and daughter. Looking at them, she pointed to the three and said, “How about you two? Do you wish to be a part of the show? Step right up and take part of this exciting experience.”<br />
<br />
The little girl saw her pointing to her and calling her out and was getting overly excited. She soon jumps off the chair and rushed to the stage as the mother got up and walked briskly towards her daughter. Once the two got on stage, the crowd looked on and wondered what Lesily will do now. Even Gloria looked on and wondered what will happen next.<br />
<br />
“Huh… A mother and daughter now. Wonder what she is planning for those two.” Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
Once the two reached the stage, Lesily got a good look at the two and could tell that they are the average Mother and Daughter. The girl looked to be ten-years-old and was wearing a pink sundress with a pair of pink sandals with gems on the straps. Her sandy blonde hair was long and was done up in a ponytail, and her ears have pink diamonds on the lobes. She already look like she was staring puberty as her arms and legs were long and thin her face is beginning to cross into adulthood with a slightly round skull, thin nose, and eyes shrinking a little bit.<br />
<br />
As for the mother, she looked to be no more then 35-years-old and has a fit body, but showing signs of aging. She was wearing a form fitting crop white crop top that holds her D-cup breasts that were soft and showing some sag. Her faded Capri pants have filled up her wide MILFy hips Muffin top stomach that has a scar in the front that was her C section when she had her daughter. She wore a pair of Ugg snow boots that while it was summer, was very fashionable on her feet. Her exposed arms remain toned, but were showing a bit of flab at her age. There were also two types of faded tattoos on her arms, one showing a skull and crossbones with flames in the background and red eyes. The other has a snake wrapped around her other arm and showing a cobra with a human heart in its mouth. Probably left there during her younger rebellious side. Her face resembled true beauty, but father time was catching up on her. She had high cheekbones with deep faint lines and crows feet around her eyes, nose, and mouth. Her light brown hair was a short and spiky bob cut with gray tips on them. Truly a unique mother, but a caring mother too boot.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked to the two and decided to introduce them. “Well, this is quite a unique parent and child dynamic. Introduce yourself to the audience.”<br />
<br />
The two heard her as the mother started. “Very well… My name if Amanda and I own a music shop.”<br />
<br />
“A music shop. Does that explain those tattoos on your arms?” she asked her.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I was a young and rebellious child with a strong taste in tasteless music. But growing up, I understand how music work and build my shop to have everyone share my musical tastes. That and the fact that I want to raise my dear daughter for a better future.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that, she turned to the daughter and said, “And what’s your name, sweetie.”<br />
<br />
The little girl soon turned to her with a smile with crossword teeth and said, “My name is Candace, but my friends call me Candy.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that, she soon asked her if she enjoys the show. “So tell me, Candy, are you enjoying the show?”<br />
<br />
Candy nodded and answered, “Yes, Ms. Lesily. I love the show. I also love seeing you regressing those women back to the one. It was really entertaining. Sadly I couldn’t watch it since mom covered my eyes during the un-birth and un creating parts. Something about being too disturbing for me.”<br />
<br />
Lesily heard that and understand what she meant. Since this is a show where she can regress or progress anyone, even shrinking them into nothingness, some of it might not be suitable to children. But they do come to observe what would happen to them, their parents, or the audience. Got to be some form of fascination in their young minds. Wondering that, she turned to the mother and asked, “Amanda, why did you bring your daughter to this show, let alone to this resort.”<br />
<br />
Amanda gave a bit of a chuckle and said, “Let’s just say my sweet Candy has quite the imagination. There were times that she feels like she wanted to grow up after playing dress up in my clothes, or live under the sheets, thinking she’s back in the womb. That’s why I arranged for this trip, to make her live her imaginations. And why not start with a show to prove to her that what this resort is about is true.”<br />
<br />
Lesily heard that and was curious about what Candy wanted. With children these days, they have quite the imagination, but she never thought that someone like Candy imagining growing up or regressing to the womb. “Is that right…” she said with interest, “Okay then, let’s let her live out her imagination.”<br />
<br />
Approaching Candy, she bent to her level and said to her, “Candy… Your mom said that you want to live your dreams of a grown up or a fetus, correct. Well, since you are now a part of my act, I want you to pick what will be yours or your mother’s fate. So what do you want to do for this performance?”<br />
<br />
Candy heard her and her eyes were gleaming. Not only that she’s going to live her dream in progressing or regressing herself, but also Lesily let her decided on what to do with her and her mother. Rubbing her chin, she wondered what she could do on the stage.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… Let’s see…” she murmured to herself.</p>
