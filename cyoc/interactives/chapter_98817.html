<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Devon was feeling pretty sexual all of a sudden and wanted to see what he looked like in the singlet again after all.  Probably that would help his erection go away or at least he wouldn&#39;t have to look at it.  He didn&#39;t know how to jack off but he knew it had to do with playing with your dick and he didn&#39;t want to go down that route just yet.  Plus he kind of wanted to savor this in a way, it felt good running around the room with this hard-on, like he was exploring the experience.<br />
<br />
He had to admit he kind of enjoyed that he could wear a singlet now.  He had always thought sports guys were jerks, but it was like now he had almost the same power that they had used over him before.  He knew what it meant to be popular and now he figured he probably could be one of the popular guys if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
As he pulled up the satiny fabric of the singlet it felt good sliding up his hairy legs and putting his arms through the straps.  He could just wear this for a while and not have to jack off and enjoy it for a bit, there was still a long time until his parents would be home.  At least an hour of fun before he&#39;d have to start figuring out how to turn back.<br />
<br />
Devon jumped on the bed just for the hell of it, feeling a little rowdy.  He&#39;d gotten taller for sure as he could slap his ceiling just by barely putting his hand up and knew he&#39;d hit his head if he sprung too hard on it.  That was kind of awesome.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell yeah&quot; he said to no one in particular, just to hear his own voice bust out.  It was like he was possessing a teenage body, which he supposed he technically was.  Just from a nerd point of view this was pretty interesting to have the chance to explore, he thought.  Not many people ever do, even if he didn&#39;t really want this.<br />
<br />
Devon hopped down off the bed, jumping to smack the top of the wall as he walked into the bathroom-- he could hit it pretty high now.<br />
<br />
He looked in the big bright mirror, flexing his arms down near his abs just as the only pose he really dared to.  He thought flexing was stupid and embarrassing but doing it with his arms crossed just in front of him wasn&#39;t risking much.  Still, embarrassed, he did it very weakly and limply at first.  Then looking in the mirror, his resolve gaining, he flexed it harder, moving on to as hard as he could.  He could really feel the strain in his arms.<br />
<br />
He put the palm of his right hand on the mirror and leaned in close to it, moving his face up towards it to see his whiskers more closely, breathing on the mirror to fog it up intentionally.  Something about looking more mature really was kind of cool and exciting.<br />
<br />
Devon licked his upper lip, just to rub his tongue over where he had shaved, and felt himself get an illicit sort of thrill -- his boner still going on under his singlet -- as the tip touched the stubble that remained there.  His lip looked smooth, but he could definitely feel stubble there.  Something about that really seemed exciting to him, like he could shave his beard but it never really was going to go away now.  What the heck was this!<br />
<br />
He walked back into his room, planning on playing some video games while his erection calmed down a bit, as he was starting to scare himself with how much he was thinking and doing stuff that was so erotic, which was just gross and wrong, but he noticed all his games laying out were now EA Sports stuff.  He sat down on the edge of the bed and turned on the tv, surfing with the remote for something sports not because he liked watching it on tv at all but just to explore it, since he had that sort of body now and probably would be able to watch it now if he wanted to without anybody thinking he was a nerd who didn&#39;t fit in.<br />
<br />
He had to see himself again, so went back into the bathroom.  This time he felt a little more courage and nobody was home, he told himself as he paused, so he looked in the mirror first lifting up an arm and seeing the dark bush there.  He had to feel it, so he reached over with his left hand and rubbed it with his palm.  That seemed like such the sort of thing guys shouldn&#39;t do, especially nerds, but it excited him.<br />
<br />
He stopped it.  Maybe I should just flex, he thought.  Though he felt anxious he flexed his arms this time above his head in a double biceps.  That seemed like a way more perverted pose because his muscles were more displayed and you could see his pit hair when he did that.  Like only seriously jock sort of guys would ever do that, definitely not chess club guys.  He couldn&#39;t believe he had just done that, but deep within he actually felt illicitly proud of himself.<br />
<br />
This was getting fun, he should stay in this singlet for a while, he thought.  It didn&#39;t hurt to explore what had happened to him so long as he didn&#39;t have to jack off like the real gross and perverted jocks in school did.</p>
