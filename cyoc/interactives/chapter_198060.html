<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lee cooked dinner, though this time, Cole was pretty sure that some of those ingredients didn&#39;t come out of the things in the kitchen.  Cole put a dictionary on her chair so she could reach the table more easily.  She was about 9 at the moment, and while she didn&#39;t use a tape measure, she guessed her height to be something like 4&#39; 3” or 4&#39; 4”.<br />
<br />
Lee had changed her clothes into a cute little Victorian style black dress, with shiny black Mary Janes and long black stockings, so she basically looked like a loligoth.  Not her preferred look, but she had to admit, she was adorable.<br />
<br />
In fact, she was pretty sure she hadn&#39;t been this cute the first time she was 9, which led her to believe that Lee was slowly molding her to her preferences.  She wasn&#39;t sure if she should be worried about that or not, but she supposed it didn&#39;t matter much- eventually she would go to Hell and Lee would give her a demonic form of her choice.<br />
<br />
While Lee cooked, Cole practiced shrinking things.  Currently on the table was a volume of the Encyclopedia Brittanica that was about the size of a matchbox, a few very tiny pens, a fork sized for a doll, and right now she was amusing herself by shrinking granola bars and popping them in her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Stop munching, you could spoil your appetite.”  Lee chided.<br />
<br />
“Shouldn&#39;t they have less calories when I shrink them?”  Lee had decided that Cole had progressed enough to practice on non-living organic matter.<br />
<br />
“If you did it right, yes.  But as we saw with your shirt before, you might not actually transmute something properly- each of those bars could, despite being tiny, have the same nutritional value.”<br />
<br />
“That actually seems kind of useful.  If I use too much magic and get hungry, I could have some shrunken candy bars or something on hand.” <br />
<br />
“I agree, but still.  No more food!  Dinner is almost ready.”<br />
<br />
Cole mock pouted, but decided to be a good girl.  She was busy shrinking napkins when Lee floated over several plates.  <br />
<br />
<br />
“Lobster frittata, a 42-ounce tomahawk ribeye, tortellini soup with sausage, chopped salad with feta cheese and shrimp, with a lemon vinaigrette, and for dessert, and for dessert, cheesecake topped with blueberry french toast gelato.  And to wash it down, Georgia peach sweet tea.”  Lee seemed very proud of her work.<br />
<br />
“There is no way on Earth you made all this that fast without cheating.”  Cole started in on her soup.  “Oh my Go...er...Devil!  This is amazing!”<br />
<br />
Lee laughed.  “No way on Earth, but not no way in Hell.  I admit, I wanted to show off.  I skipped the caviar with the lobster frittata- I&#39;m not a huge fan of fish eggs.”<br />
<br />
“Never had them.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re not missing much.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
For several minutes, Cole devoured her food, while Lee ate more slowly (but definitely faster than her usual pace).  “Uh.  Problem with a small body.  It comes with a small stomach.”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“I told you not to snack!  Give it a few minutes dear.”<br />
<br />
“Say um...I just realized this.  I haven&#39;t had to go to the bathroom all day.  Is that normal?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes.  I improved your body&#39;s ability to digest food.  You should only have to use the bathroom if you eat something completely undigestable or you seriously overeat.  This will eventually cause your small intestines to atrophy, so keep that in mind.”<br />
<br />
Cole busied herself with shrinking more napkins to build her appetite back up.  The food looked so good she wanted to eat it all!  “This is pretty wild.  A few days ago, my idea of dinner would be half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.”<br />
<br />
“Well one part increased appetite and one part eating good food will do that to you.”  Lee smiled.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, all the plates were clean, and Lee used her magic to have the dishes literally wash themselves in the sink, and dry as well.  It was pretty fascinating to watch, all things considered.<br />
<br />
The two then took a shower together, but it was fairly innocent, as Cole&#39;s libido was affected by her younger body.  &#39;Though it certainly wasn&#39;t earlier, in the car&#39;, she thought.  She giggled as Lee helped her wash her body, throwing in a few kisses.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t quite as exciting as being licked clean (or put into Lee&#39;s mouth), but it was pleasant, and soon they were both cuddling on Cole&#39;s bed, wearing matching bathrobes.  Since Cole only had the one previously, she assumed Lee had conjured the second, smaller one.<br />
<br />
Currently, she was perched in Lee&#39;s lap, who had her arms wrapped around the smaller girl.  Cole started to drift off to sleep...<br />
<br />
She found herself in what looked to be a hot spring.  The sky was dark and cloudy, and there was a faint scent of sulfur in the air.  The water was warm and steaming, and several tiki torches lit the area.  Cole was seated in a shallow pool.<br />
<br />
A girl of 16 started moving towards her.  She had a short bob of orange hair framing a heart shaped face with softly glowing orange eyes, with two small black horns sticking out of it.  Tiny red bat wings protruded from her back, and a tail of the same color with a heart-shaped tip swished from side to side as she walked.  She was naked, of course, and while her breasts were small, she had wide hips and great legs.  As if noticing she was being watched, the girl turned in place, giving Cole a nice view of her smooth behind.  <br />
<br />
She then knelt in the water before Cole.  “Milady, I am Winryaa.  I have been asked to tend to your every need and desire.”<br />
<br />
Cole gulped.  Even as a little girl, Winryaa&#39;s raw sex appeal hit her like a hammer.  “Where am I?”<br />
<br />
“A very interesting question, Milady.  Physically, you remain in your room on Earth.  However, your mind has wandered into the Dreamlands- that place where all men go when they sleep, though they rarely recall their journey.  This place is a reflection of Duke Dantalyon&#39;s compound.  This is Dantalyon&#39;s private spa.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.  Lee must have cast that spell on me.  Uh where is she?  That is, Dantalyon?”<br />
<br />
“She will be joining you soon.  Until then, I am to keep you company...or more, as you desire.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s really tempting, but...I mean, I&#39;m a kid right now.”  Cole stammered.<br />
<br />
“If you like, I could become younger as well.  Normally I&#39;m good at guessing what someone&#39;s preferences are, but you are difficult to read.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re a Succubus, then?”<br />
<br />
Winryaa smiled, and her wings flapped as she did so.  “I am.”<br />
<br />
“Well...I have kind of an abnormal kink, I guess.”  Cole blushed.<br />
<br />
“Please, do tell.  I would be happy to accommodate you.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m not sure if you really can, see...I like girls mostly, but where it counts...I want a girl who used to be a boy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, like a trans girl?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sort of, but I mean, a boy that was transformed into a 100% real girl.”  Cole explained.<br />
<br />
“Well, you&#39;re in luck, and now I understand why the Duke picked me to attend to her guest.  In life, my name was Rhys Winters.”  The Succubus smiled.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Wow.  Really?”  Cole was suddenly intrigued.  <br />
<br />
The girl nodded.  “Do you want to hear my story?”<br />
<br />
“Yes please, uh, you look uncomfortable kneeling like that, come sit with me.”<br />
<br />
The demoness got up and moved to sit next to Cole.  Cole then shifted to sit in the demon girl&#39;s lap, and Winrya put her arms around her, just like Lee had done.  <br />
<br />
“Comfy?  I can make myself softer for you.”<br />
<br />
“No, you&#39;re fine.  Perfect, really.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.  Well, when I was a little boy, I lived with my twin sister and our mother.  Mom was very very pretty, and both my sister and I wanted to grow up to be just like her.  I was three when I realized that would never happen- that I was a boy and would become a man, not a woman.<br />
<br />
I was very depressed, but I resigned myself to my fate.  Then a car accident took my sister&#39;s life, and scarred my mother&#39;s pretty face.  She was different after that.  Something was broken inside her, but I didn&#39;t realize that at the time.<br />
<br />
She began to insist I was her daughter, and made me wear my sister&#39;s clothes.  “She was taken too young, it&#39;s not fair.  You need to be pretty for her, to do the things she was meant to do.”<br />
<br />
She called me by my sister&#39;s name, Christina.  I became Christina, and was even enrolled in school as a girl.  But I was keenly aware of my secret.  My shame.<br />
<br />
When I got older, Mom gave me pills to keep me small and feminine.  Blocking my growth and preventing puberty.  I was given dance lessons, and acting lessons, and I learned to play several instruments, and Mom put me in beauty pageants.  I was glorious.<br />
<br />
Then it was discovered I was a boy.  The state took me from my Mother, and she was sent to a mental care facility.  I was taken in by my great-aunt, who told me I was a boy, and not a girl.<br />
<br />
I had to wear boy clothes, and if I acted in any way feminine, I was punished.  She took my medicine away from me, but the damage was done.  I would be a small, delicate boy.  <br />
<br />
I was called gay, and a freak.  My hair was cut very short.  But privately, I still wished to become a girl.  Mom had said there was surgery.  But it was expensive.  The pageant money was supposed to pay for it but...I had to return it, obviously.<br />
<br />
You needed to be a girl to win.”<br />
<br />
Cole felt warm tears and looked up to see Winrya was crying.  The tears seemed to burn her skin.  Shifting fully, she hugged the demon tightly.<br />
<br />
“Thank you...I...I thought the pain was gone.  But I guess not.”  She stroked Cole&#39;s hair gently.  “Demons aren&#39;t really supposed to cry.  It stings.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry.  You can stop if you want.”<br />
<br />
“No, I want to tell you.  Don&#39;t worry.  I won&#39;t scar, I&#39;m a quick healer.”  Winrya took a deep breath and went back to her story.<br />
<br />
“I would run away from home, but always, I&#39;d be found and dragged back, and punished.  Because they were looking for a boy.  So when I was sixteen, I secretly bought girl clothes, makeup, and a wig.<br />
<br />
I was finally free.  But I&#39;d never worked a day in my life, and I was still small and weak.  It was hard.  Men would try to molest me, but be disgusted when they found out what I was.  I had to avoid social workers and police.<br />
<br />
For a time, I found shelter at a mission, but when the priest found out that I was a boy, he...he...called me an abomination.”  Winrya started sobbing, and Cole just held onto her.<br />
<br />
“You are no such thing.”  Cole turned her head and saw Lee there.  No.  Dantalyon.  She still looked pretty much the same, but she was much taller, and her eyes were once again windows to the night sky.  She had a pair of black, feathered wings protruding from her back, but they were quite large, nothing like Winryaa&#39;s tiny wings.  <br />
<br />
“My Duke!”  Winryaa bowed her head, but Dantalyon strode up to her and placed her hand on the Succubi&#39;s head gently.  <br />
<br />
“It wasn&#39;t right the way you were treated.  You know that, don&#39;t you?”  Dantalyon frowned.<br />
<br />
“I do, my Duke.  But telling the story...I feel like that boy again.”  Winryaa explained.<br />
<br />
The Duke of Hell sighed.  Her wings folded up and were absorbed into her back, and she sat down in the water, pulling both girls into her lap.  “I&#39;m sorry.  I offered to take those memories from you.”<br />
<br />
“I know, and I appreciated the offer then, and still do.  But that pain is a part of me.  Even though it hurts, without it, I wouldn&#39;t be...myself.”  Winryaa explained.<br />
<br />
“Can you continue?”  The Fallen asked.<br />
<br />
“Y...yes.  So, I was cast out of the church.  I had no place to go, and I was starving.  Some men grabbed me.  They said a pretty girl like me was worth a lot of money.  They tried to sell me...but when it was found out I was a boy, they were killed, and I was beaten.<br />
<br />
Still, there was money in a pretty boy, so I wasn&#39;t killed.  They gave me drugs, got me hooked, and I lived in what I thought was Hell.  It wasn&#39;t Hell.  It was worse than Hell.<br />
<br />
I prayed.  I begged.  I pleaded.  But no answer from Heaven.  In that moment I realized, I must be an abomination.  A monster.  No one loved me.  No one cared.  So I...I began to blaspheme.  I cursed my Creator, I demanded that if they didn&#39;t care, then kill me, because I didn&#39;t want to live anymore.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when I heard a voice in my head.  &#39;Would you sell your soul to be free?&#39;<br />
<br />
I wondered if I had imagined it.  But the voice spoke again.  &#39;I can help you.&#39;<br />
<br />
So I said, &#39;if you help me, you can have my soul, since Heaven doesn&#39;t want it!&#39;.<br />
<br />
The voice laughed and asked me what I wanted.  I said I wanted to die.  It seemed confused.  I guess that&#39;s not a common request.  Again the voice asked me what I wanted, and I said I didn&#39;t want to live in this cruel world anymore.<br />
<br />
It said it couldn&#39;t kill me.  It wasn&#39;t that strong.  I laughed.  But finally I said, fine.  Heal the other girls and set them free.  Let them out of this Hell, and make it so they can be happy again.<br />
<br />
The voice sounded pained, and said &#39;your wish is granted&#39;.  What I didn&#39;t know then, of course, is that making a pact with a demon for something completely selfless, has a special kind of power.  Most demons refuse such pacts, but when I told it that it could have my soul, the pact had already been made.<br />
<br />
All that was left was for the creature to fulfill it&#39;s end of the bargain.  <br />
<br />
Then police came and raided the place.  The girls all recovered, and, I&#39;m happy to say, they are living healthy, good lives.  I wasn&#39;t so lucky.  I didn&#39;t die, but I was put in the hospital.  They found out who I was and contacted my aunt.<br />
<br />
And she told them I could die for all she cared.  I was already dead to her.<br />
<br />
My treatment was too expensive, and my doctor told me they were going to discharge me.  I was very sick and in pain.  The night before I was to be discharged, I managed to get up, I ripped the IV out of my arm.  I was bleeding but I didn&#39;t care.  I crept out of the hospital room, and I found some pills that had been left out to be distributed to patients.  I took them all, found an empty room, and hid in a closet.  And died.<br />
<br />
I like to think I died with a smile on my face, but I probably puked up blood.  Now, suicides always go to Hell.  It&#39;s one of the rules.  My soul was forfeit anyways, so I didn&#39;t think that mattered.  What I didn&#39;t know was, until my soul was claimed, I could still technically go to Heaven.  But instead, I fell all the way to Hell, and found myself naked and cold among the lost souls at the gates.<br />
<br />
The people there were screaming and mad with grief and torment.  There was violence and rape but nobody could die.  Fat demons with whips and tiny imps with spears came for me.  But when they touched me, the were burned!<br />
<br />
Then a larger Imp came, with a tall, beautiful person in tow.  Neither male nor female, I&#39;d never seen anyone so wonderful.  The Imp gestured to me.  &#39;My Duke, that&#39;s the soul.  I can&#39;t touch it!&#39;<br />
<br />
I looked up, and the person spoke...”<br />
<br />
Dantalyon spoke then.  “That&#39;s because her soul is too pure for you to touch, Dire.  The torments of her life, and the circumstances of her death have Damned her to Hell, but she remains pure.”<br />
<br />
“And I said, I&#39;m sorry, great one, but I&#39;m not a girl.”  Winryaa said, smiling despite her tears.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re wrong.  I can see what you really are.  You are most definitely a girl, and a pretty one.  Serve me, and all your dreams will come true.”  Dantalyon recalled her words then.<br />
<br />
“All I want is not to suffer anymore, great one.”  Winryaa wiped her tears away.<br />
<br />
“And then I picked her up in my arms, and flew her to my estate.  I gave her a new form, and a new purpose.”  Dantalyon smiled softly.<br />
<br />
“Worst Succubus ever.” Winrya laughed.  “There&#39;s just too much goodness in me.”<br />
<br />
The Duke of Hell shrugged.  “I could have beat it out of you, but I&#39;m not one for kicking puppies.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m so sorry that happened to you, Winrya.  But thank you for sharing your story with me.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re welcome, Cole.  I feel better now.  Though I have failed you, my Duke.  You asked that I cater to your guest&#39;s needs and desires...and instead she has been comforting me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, you wouldn&#39;t punish her?!”  Cole was aghast.  “I desired to hear her story!”<br />
<br />
“Technically, that is true.  But a small punishment is still in order.  She obeyed the letter, not the spirit of my orders.”  Dantalyon said.  “However, I will let you choose her punishment, Cole.”<br />
<br />
“Me?!  I don&#39;t even want to punish her!” Cole protested.<br />
<br />
“Nevertheless, you must.  Don&#39;t disappoint.”  Dantalyon raised a fist to her chin.<br />
<br />
“Ugh...I&#39;m so sorry, Winryaa.” <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t be, Cole.  I should be punished.”  The Succubus smiled gently.<br />
<br />
“Fine...”  Cole tried to think of something, then she had an idea.  “For your punishment, you must give Dantalyon the best kiss you&#39;ve ever given.”<br />
<br />
Winryaa&#39;s eyes got big, and she looked up to her Mistress.  <br />
<br />
Dantalyon started to chuckle.  It started low, almost masculine, but raised in pitch and volume until it sounded like the delighted laughter of a young girl.  “Well, it&#39;s your punishment, Winryaa.  What choice do you have?”<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, Winryaa flew up, somehow supported by her comically small wings.  She then put her hands on Dantalyon&#39;s cheeks and leaned in, planting a kiss on the Fallen&#39;s mouth.  Her tail snaked around and the tip began to rub against Dantalyon&#39;s left nipple, even as she deepened the kiss.<br />
<br />
With a soft moan, the tall demoness responded in kind, her arms hugging Winryaa close to her.<br />
<br />
Child body or no, Cole was stupidly aroused.  The kiss was one of the hottest things she&#39;d ever seen!<br />
<br />
It seemed to go on forever, and Cole realized demons probably don&#39;t need to breathe.  If she got any more excited, she was going to have to rub one out right there, but just then, the two girls parted, a thin strand of saliva stretching between their mouths.<br />
<br />
“My Duke.”  Winryaa bowed her head.<br />
<br />
“Winryaa, that kiss was amazing.”  Dantalyon said.  “Only love could make a kiss that wonderful.  Have you loved me for a long time?”<br />
<br />
“My Duke...I have loved you since you insisted that I was a girl.  Since you took me in your arms and brought me here.  Since you gave me this body and placed me in your harem, where I have been treated better than I ever had been while I was alive.  From afar, I have loved you with all my being.”<br />
<br />
“Lee, kiss her already!”  Cole shouted.<br />
<br />
Dantalyon laughed again, and kissed Winryaa.  And if anything, this kiss was even more amazing than the last.  Cole couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and she touched her small, sensitive pussy.  The sensation of it made her gasp.<br />
<br />
&#39;Who knew two demonesses making out was high quality fap material?&#39;, she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
The two parted a second time, and Dantalyon gestured to Cole.  Winryaa immediately descended back into the water and pushed Cole&#39;s hand away.  “Allow me.”<br />
<br />
Submerging her head beneath the water, Winryaa began probing Cole&#39;s slit with her tongue, making the girl cry out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Dantalyon, having taken her Lee form again, sat behind Cole.  Cole felt herself growing, and small breasts began to form on her chest, which Lee then took into her hands and began playing with her nipples.<br />
<br />
Winryaa&#39;s tongue began growing inside her body, and soon she was being thoroughly fucked by the demon girl&#39;s tongue.  Cole didn&#39;t know how much more she could take, when she felt Lee&#39;s sharp teeth nibbling on her ear lobe.<br />
<br />
She lost her mind completely as she reached orgasm, but her two lovers were relentless, and made her come multiple times until she finally lost consciousness....except, she didn&#39;t.  It was the strangest thing, her body was limp and her eyes closed, but she was looking down at the tableaux from above.<br />
<br />
“What...what&#39;s going on?”<br />
<br />
Lee looked up and laughed.  “You idiot!  You can&#39;t fall asleep in a dream!”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Uh, how do I...fix this?”  Cole was very confused.<br />
<br />
Winrya took to the air and grabbed Cole, then brought her down, where she merged with her slumbering body.  It was a pleasant sensation, and she felt like two droplets of water becoming one.<br />
<br />
Cole opened her eyes.  “Oh shit...that was...you two...thank you.”<br />
<br />
Winrya grinned.  “It was my pleasure.  I guess I&#39;m boy enough for you?”<br />
<br />
“N..no.  Lee is right.  You&#39;re definitely a girl.  I think I just found another kink, that&#39;s all.”<br />
<br />
“You mean, besides overpowered demon girls?”  Lee teased.<br />
<br />
“Overpowered demon girls making out with each other.”  Cole said, blushing.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I guess that probably did look kind of hot.”  Winrya giggled.<br />
<br />
“I can assure you, it was very hot, my darling Winrya.  I think you&#39;re owed a reward.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“My Duke, I live to serve.”  Winrya went to one knee.<br />
<br />
“No, none of that.  At least when I&#39;m in this form, you can call me Lee.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t deserve such a reward...Lee.”  Winrya seemed awestruck.<br />
<br />
“Oh that&#39;s not your reward, my Succubus.  Or at least, not all of it.  I&#39;m giving you a new job.  From now on, you are one of my personal handmaidens.”<br />
<br />
Winrya opened her mouth, then shut it.  She had literally been struck dumb!<br />
<br />
“She was already in your harem, right?  What does this entail?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, now she is one of my favored concubines, and more than that, she is personally responsible for tending to my every need, and guarding my person.”<br />
<br />
“My...Lee...I&#39;m not a warrior.  I&#39;ve lost every fight I&#39;ve ever been in!  Your other handmaidens are strong and capable.  I couldn&#39;t possibly serve you as such!”  Winrya protested.<br />
<br />
“Are you turning down your promotion, Winrya?”  Lee raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I...uh...no.” The demon girl managed.<br />
<br />
“Good.  Then effective immediately, you are counted among my Handmaidens.”  Lee made a gesture, and Winrya&#39;s body seemed to glow momentarily.  “I have increased your power- we&#39;ll have to see whether or not you will evolve.”<br />
<br />
“Evolve?  Like a Pokemon?”  Cole couldn&#39;t keep from sounding dubious.<br />
<br />
“There are two ways a Devil can rise in rank.  They can be transformed into a new form, or, after gaining power and experience, they can ascend to a new, unique form.  Winrya now has the power to evolve, but something will have to trigger it.  What that event is, I cannot say.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Lee.  I will do my best.”  Winrya said.<br />
<br />
“See that you do.  Now, Winrya, it&#39;s true I don&#39;t expect you to defend me from assassins, but I have a special assignment for you.  You will join us on Earth.  Cole is my Apprentice, and you will guard and serve her just as you would myself.  I have no doubt you can take on just about any mortal, and most low-ranked demons.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, so I get my very own Succubus?”  Cole smiled.<br />
<br />
“When I&#39;m not using her, that is.  And I do plan to use her.  Extensively.”  Lee promised, and Cole saw that Winrya shivered.  “And she can help me instruct you in matters of romance and seduction, even as I teach you both magic.”<br />
<br />
“Magic?  Me?!”  Winrya was shocked.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have talent for it, but you have a good deal of power.  So you should be able to handle some spells, and keep pace with Cole, who has talent, but not much power.  At least, in theory.  You&#39;ve surprised me a few times now, Cole, and I really need to investigate that further.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m going to need a bigger bed.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“No, instead, Winrya will stay with you at night.  I think I&#39;ll procure a house of my own.  Which you both will be visiting often, so don&#39;t look so down, Winrya.”<br />
<br />
“I...I&#39;m sorry Lee.  I was just hoping I could...sleep near you.”  Winrya said.<br />
<br />
“On nights we don&#39;t have school in the morning, you will sleep with me, as will Cole, I assure you.”  <br />
<br />
“School?”  Winrya blinked.<br />
<br />
“I expect you to be with Cole at all times.  So yes, you will be attending school with us.  As I recall, you never graduated, so this will be good for you.”  Lee explained.<br />
<br />
“Ooh.  I get a new wardrobe!”  Winrya brightened.  <br />
<br />
“The cutest and most adorable dresses, my dear.”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
Winrya actually stood up and did a happy dance.  Cole giggled.  She was going to like having the Succubus as a friend!<br />
<br />
“Now, as fun as this all was, we still have to visit some dreams.” Lee rose and helped Cole up.  Cole judged her current age to be 13, and she was a few inches over 5&#39; tall.  She hadn&#39;t gotten a good approximation of Winrya&#39;s height before, but the girl was definitely shy of 5&#39; tall.  She put her at 4&#39; 11”.<br />
<br />
Taking the hands of both other girls, Lee led them into the dreamscape.<br />
<br />
<br />
They were in Alison&#39;s dream.  The girl was dressed in armor, wielding a sword bigger than she was like it was a toothpick.  She had a tiara on her head, and a cape was attached to her armor by golden chains.<br />
<br />
She was fending off a small army of what appeared to be middle schoolers, but they were all about twice normal height.  She was heading for a tower, and in the highest window of the tower was a girl who could be Lee&#39;s younger sister.<br />
<br />
“Know who ye face, blackguards!?  It is I, the Princess of Battle, Alison the Strong!  I don&#39;t care if I have to slay 100 of you, or 200 of you, I will save the Princess Lee!”<br />
<br />
<br />
“Oh my.”  Lee put a hand to her mouth.  “I&#39;m a princess now?”<br />
<br />
“Luke was right.  You started this.”  Cole grinned.<br />
<br />
“Who is that girl, Lee?”  Winrya asked.  <br />
<br />
“A young girl I encountered earlier.  It seems I made an impression on her.  You two watch, I&#39;m going to merge with my shade in the tower.”  Lee vanished, but the princess in the tower seemed more distinct.<br />
<br />
“Something tells me that Lee is going to collect another pet.”  Cole shook her head.<br />
<br />
“She does take in strays a lot.  It&#39;s one of her more adorable traits.”  Winrya said, perching on a rock and producing some popcorn.  “Kettle corn?”<br />
<br />
Cole sat on the rock with her.  “Don&#39;t mind if I do.  Say, Winrya.  You really love her, don&#39;t you?  Doesn&#39;t this, I don&#39;t know, make you jealous?”<br />
<br />
“If I&#39;m being honest, intensely.  But while Lee understands love, I don&#39;t know that she feels it the same way you or I do.  She has many favorites, after all.  I was happy to love her from afar, so...having to share her doesn&#39;t seem so bad.”<br />
<br />
“But it still bugs you.”  Cole pressed.<br />
<br />
“It does, yes.”  The demoness admitted.<br />
<br />
“Uh.  Despite what she said.  You don&#39;t have to have sex with me or anything.  I know you love her.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, but honestly, I don&#39;t mind it at all.  I&#39;m hoping we can be friends.”  <br />
<br />
“Oh, I already thought of you as one, Winrya.”  Cole smiled.<br />
<br />
Winrya gave her a hug.  “I&#39;m glad.  I think you&#39;re one of her favorites right now as well, but I guess sharing her with you won&#39;t be so bad.”<br />
<br />
“I hope so.  You&#39;ve been hurt so much, I wouldn&#39;t want anything to get in the way between the two of you.”  <br />
<br />
“You really mean that, don&#39;t you?  I think I&#39;m really going to like you, Cole.”  Winrya kissed her on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“Aw.  I like you too.  Even if you weren&#39;t really a boy.”  Cole laughed.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s alright, I know how to get you fired up.  I just have to make out with Lee, right?”<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s laughter died in her throat.  “Uh...guh...”<br />
<br />
Winrya giggled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Her armor dented and bloodied, her cape long since torn to shreds, and her sword broken at the tip, Princess Alison reached the tower.  She was exhausted, but she bust open the door and climbed the stairs.  <br />
<br />
There, waiting for her, was Princess Lee.  Without a word, Lee helped Alison remove her armor, and stripped off her padding, tunic, and breeches.  Alison&#39;s body was covered in bruises, and she shivered, a little embarrassed at being naked in front of such a beautiful girl.<br />
<br />
Lee helped her into a tub of warm water, and Alison sighed at how good the water felt.  The tub was large, and she had lots of room to move.  Then, to her shock, Lee got into the water as well.<br />
<br />
Lee&#39;s naked body was more mature than Alison&#39;s, despite them both being of an age with one another.  She leaned in close to Alison.  “My savior deserves a reward.”<br />
<br />
Alison gulped. “I...I...but we&#39;re both girls!”<br />
<br />
“You find me attractive, don&#39;t you?”  Lee asked.<br />
<br />
“Y..yes.  Very much.  But...”<br />
<br />
Lee silenced her with a kiss.  Her soft lips felt warm, and Alison thought she would faint.  She felt a hand on her chest, and another on her thigh.  Was...was she going to...?<br />
<br />
“Lee...I...I&#39;ve never done anything like this before.”  Alison felt like crying.  Lee was so pretty, and Gods, she wanted the lass!  A need grew inside her body like nothing she&#39;d ever felt before.  But they were so young!  They were only in the fifth grade, should they be doing this?<br />
<br />
“I know.  I want to teach you so badly.  I want you to bed me, and make me yours.  I want to marry you, my Princess, and be your bride.”<br />
<br />
Alison whimpered.  Married...to a girl?  She thought about herself in a tux, and Lee wearing a stunning wedding dress.  “I would be the happiest girl in the world, to have you as my bride.”<br />
<br />
“I am so glad to hear that, my champion.  Long have I been here, in this tower, waiting for you to save me.  I have saved myself for you, longing for your touch.  But we can take it slowly, if you need to.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m afraid I have growing up to do.”  Alison admitted.<br />
<br />
“Are you ashamed of your body?  You needn&#39;t be.  I think you are beautiful the way you are.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks...thank you.  But I think the growing I need to do is on the inside.  Even though I want you, need you, like growing things need the sun&#39;s light, I can&#39;t find the courage to claim you.”<br />
<br />
“I could claim you, instead, my dearest.”  Lee&#39;s smile turned dark and seductive.<br />
<br />
“I...” Alison had no words.  But delaying no longer had any value.  “Then take me, my beloved.”<br />
<br />
And take her Lee did, and Alison cried out many times before the dawn...<br />
<br />
<br />
Alison woke up.  She was sweaty and hot and was tangled up in her covers.  The area between her legs felt damp and sticky.  She reached down the front of her pajama bottoms to find them soaked.  It didn&#39;t smell like pee, and when she brought up her fingers to her nose, the smell was...strange.  Musky.  <br />
<br />
“Ew.”  She said.  But she wasn&#39;t really disgusted.  More...intrigued.  But she was going to have to clean up the mess either way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee returned, though she appeared to be a girl of 11, if somewhat more developed.  She wiped her brow.  “Whew, that was intense.  A girl&#39;s first sexual awakening is something else.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, that&#39;s some crush she&#39;s got.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll say.  I think she just had a wet dream.”  Lee giggled helplessly.<br />
<br />
The other two stared at her, and Lee had to explain about the bathtub.<br />
<br />
“Oh man.  You had sex with her?  She&#39;s only a kid!”  Cole protested.<br />
<br />
“Says the girl who went down on me as a seven year-old.”  Lee teased.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but she&#39;s really a kid!” Cole knew how lame she sounded.<br />
<br />
“Mhm, so she&#39;s a zygote.  Same as you.”  <br />
<br />
“Fuck.  I can&#39;t win this one, can I?” Cole sighed.  “I concede defeat, Milady.”<br />
<br />
“I graciously accept your surrender.  Though I feel punishment is owed you.”<br />
<br />
Cole shook her head.  “Of course it is.”<br />
<br />
“If it&#39;s any consolation, I&#39;d have loved to have Lee come to my bed when I was 11.”  Winrya said.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, really, me too, but she&#39;s so innocent...feels a little wrong to just drag her into being an adult so fast.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, Cole.  I&#39;ll be very gentle with her.  Besides, it wasn&#39;t real sex.  She doesn&#39;t know how that feels yet, so it was just dream sex.  It felt pleasant, but no details, just fade to black.”  Lee explained.<br />
<br />
“Huh.  I guess that is harmless.  Sorry.”<br />
<br />
“No need.  I am a demon, after all.  It&#39;s perfectly legitimate to worry about the state of her soul.”  <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s too bad I need to be with Cole.  This girl already knows you as being older...but I could easily go to her school and befriend her.”  Winrya said.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s not the worst idea.  You could even pretend to be my younger sister.  But it would mean I&#39;d have less time to teach you magic.”  Lee frowned.<br />
<br />
“Please, allow me to do this, Lee.  You can&#39;t ask another Succubus to do it, Alison is too pure- anyone besides you or I would be burned by her.”  Winrya pleaded.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  I guess then I could stay with Cole when you cannot.  Very well, but if there&#39;s ever a conflict, Cole takes priority.”  Lee decided.<br />
<br />
“You won&#39;t regret this!”  Winrya&#39;s form changed, and now she was Lee&#39;s twin.<br />
<br />
In response, Lee grew to be 17 again.  “Hm, you almost look too much like me.  What do you think, Cole?”<br />
<br />
“Well, it&#39;s true, it&#39;s a really strong resemblance.  The problem is, you&#39;re both too perfect.  Maybe you need an imperfection, Winrya.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds like a good idea, and it could help someone tell us apart more easily.  What do you think it should be, Cole?”<br />
<br />
“Well, for starters, you could have to wear glasses, since Lee doesn&#39;t.  What about a handicap?”  Cole considered.<br />
<br />
“Oh!  Hey that&#39;s not bad.  Alison would feel she has to protect her.”  Lee chimed in.<br />
<br />
“I can do that.  Wheelchair bound?  Or I have to walk with crutches?”  Winrya asked.<br />
<br />
“How about...a prosthetic.  You&#39;re missing your leg just below the knee.  You can walk, but some things are difficult for you.  Childhood accident, and your leg had to be amputated.”  <br />
<br />
“Perfect!” Winrya sat down on the rock, and her right leg below the knee was absorbed into her body, leaving her with a stump with a metal screw jutting out of it.  The skin near it was criss-crossed with small white scars.<br />
<br />
Lee conjured a prosthetic lower leg for Winrya and helped her attach it.  The Succubus got up and took a few experimental steps.  “Yes, I can do this.  Good thing I have good balance.”<br />
<br />
“Now you just need a name.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  Lee means &#39;meadow&#39;.  So...how about Brooke?”<br />
<br />
“Brooke Dante?” Lee tried it out.<br />
<br />
“Tara Brooke Dante.”  Winrya said.  <br />
<br />
“Ooh, yes, perfect!”  Cole applauded and &#39;Tara&#39; managed a bow while keeping her right leg stiff.  <br />
<br />
“Thank you, thank you.”  Tara smiled.<br />
<br />
“Now, Tara, you get to punish Cole.”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
Tara giggled.  “I guess turnaround is fair play.”<br />
<br />
Cole gulped.  “Oh no.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m thinking a transformation, Lee.  Any suggestions?”  Tara said, with a grin.<br />
<br />
“She likes size and age changes, so it wouldn&#39;t punish her much.”  Lee explained.<br />
<br />
“So something weird then.  I&#39;d say merging, but she&#39;s only human.”  <br />
<br />
“Wait, merging?”  Cole rose an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Yes, one or more demons can physically be melded together.  It&#39;s one of my favorites, feeling you become a part of someone else, and they a part of you, as you are forced to share a body.  It&#39;s very intimate.”  Tara seemed wistful.  “It&#39;s hard to describe the experience.  But since you&#39;re not a demon, it could be hard to separate you afterwards.”<br />
<br />
Cole shivered.  She kind of wanted to try that now, but being permanently a part of someone else?  Or worse, completely absorbed by them?  She wasn&#39;t quite ready to take that step!<br />
<br />
“Oh I know.  Mouth pussy.”  Tara giggled.  Her voice sounded innocent...almost.<br />
<br />
Before Cole could even ask, Lee said “Done”, and snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
Cole felt a warmth between her legs as something began to change down there.  She gasped and felt a wave of pleasure that threatened to knock her over, but Lee grabbed and supported her.<br />
<br />
“Feels good, don&#39;t it?”  Tara beamed.<br />
<br />
“What...what did you do?”  Cole managed to speak.<br />
<br />
“Pull down your skirt and find out.”  Lee replied.<br />
<br />
So that&#39;s what Cole did, but she couldn&#39;t really see anything.  Reaching down with a hand, she was surprised to find a pair of plump, soft lips where her slit should be.  “What the fuck?”<br />
<br />
Tara produced a mirror out of nowhere and Cole could now see.  Where her pussy should be, was a very human looking mouth!  Pressing her finger inside, she could feel it was wet, and there was...a tongue inside?<br />
<br />
The instant she came into contact with the tongue, she nearly fell over again.  “Oh fuck!”, she exclaimed.  It was so sensitive, it felt like an electric current had run up her spine!  She found that she could control her new mouth, and the tongue was quite long, able to stretch a few inches out of her body.  She found that she didn&#39;t have teeth in her second mouth, just a firm gum ridge.  She placed her finger inside and started sucking on it, and was rewarded with an intense feeling of pleasure, which made her groan.<br />
<br />
“Oh...oh...fuck me...”  Cole gasped.<br />
<br />
“Maybe later.”  Lee laughed.  “Now, try talking.”<br />
<br />
“What, with...uh, ok.”  Cole concentrated, and a sultry voice emanated from her pussy.  “Well hello, darlings.  Who wants to give me a kiss?”  Her new mouth had a bit of a lisp that Cole found oddly sexy (probably due to the larger tongue).<br />
<br />
“Ooh, me.”  Tara smiled, showing her teeth.<br />
<br />
“Definitely later, now come on, we have another dream to visit.”  Lee pressed on and the other two followed, even as Cole was coming to terms with her transformation.<br />
<br />
<br />
They found themselves in a long hallway.  Doors could be found on either side, stretching on for quite awhile.  Affixed to each door was a frame, but instead of a portrait, the frame had a mirror.<br />
<br />
“The Hall of Personas.  Everyone has different facets of their personality, different masks they were.  Maybe they behave differently at work, or with family, than they do with friends?  Maybe there are secret selves that they hide from the world.  Each door represents a different Luke.”  Lee explained.<br />
<br />
“I feel dirty even being here.” Cole admitted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  It&#39;s pretty private.”  Tara looked at one mirror.  “Is he an athlete?  This one is kind of cute.”<br />
<br />
Cole looked, and found Luke as a basketball player.  He was tall and lean, and had a competitive smirk.  “Yeah he&#39;s good, too.”<br />
<br />
They wandered around for a bit.  There was Older Brother, Good Student, Dutiful Son...a dirty Luke dressed as a mechanic that Cole nicknamed “Gearhead”, and even a musclebound, savage looking Luke that Cole guessed was “Bully Buster”, the reason bullies tended to back down from him.<br />
<br />
“Aha, here we go.”  Lee pointed to a mirror that was painted black.  “Here&#39;s where he puts the selves he hides from the world.”  She opened the door and strolled in.<br />
<br />
They found a nervous, scared looking Luke who was trying to hide a porn magazine.  Cole was surprised to find it had men and women in it!<br />
<br />
“Closeted bisexual.”  Tara commented.  “A lot of people have one, or something similar.  Most humans are at least slightly gay or have sexual urges that aren&#39;t straight.  And this is what they do to them.  Lock them away due to shame or not understanding them.”<br />
<br />
There was a Luke dressed like a stereotypical “Good ole boy”, who leered at them, and made some sexist comments, while sneering at the “Fag boy”.  <br />
<br />
“Oh man.  I can see why he keeps this one hidden.”  Cole made a face.<br />
<br />
“Even people who see themselves as open minded have a distrust of things they fully don&#39;t understand.  So deep inside them is a racist, bigoted, sexist jerk.  Small mind and big mouth.  To his credit, Luke apparently hates this side of himself a lot.  Nothing some therapy wouldn&#39;t cure.”  Lee did, however, punch the redneck, knocking him out.   “There, honey, he won&#39;t bother you for a bit.”  She said to Bi-Curious Luke who smiled and thanked her.<br />
<br />
And then, finally, in the corner, Tara found a small figure.  “Ah, there you are.  Hello, honey.”<br />
<br />
A little girl in a pink dress looked up at Tara.  “Are you scary people?”<br />
<br />
Tara picked up the girl, who was maybe 4 or 5.  “No honey, we&#39;re good people.”  The little girl seemed to accept that, and clung to Tara.<br />
<br />
“Inner Child, and apparently, Luke&#39;s Inner Girl as well.”  Tara explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh...she&#39;s adorable.”  Cole breathed.  <br />
<br />
“Given how small she is, Luke has been repressing her for a long time.  Always trying to be mature, more like an adult, and definitely -not- a girl.  That bigot back there didn&#39;t create himself- I&#39;m thinking Cole&#39;s father gave him some wrong lessons at an early age.”  Lee seemed annoyed.<br />
<br />
“Papa says I need to be a real man.”  The girl said.<br />
<br />
Tara had a pained look on her face.  “No honey, your Papa is wrong.  You can be anyone you want to be.”<br />
<br />
Cole figured, given her own past, this had to hit Tara hard.  She wondered if she had a little boy somewhere inside her, somewhere.<br />
<br />
Lee handed a small, glowing object to Tara, who handed it to the girl.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, it&#39;s pretty, what is it?”  The girl said.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a seed, little one.  If you can find someplace to plant it, where it has light, it will grow into a beautiful flower.”  Tara hid her pain and smiled, setting the girl down.<br />
<br />
“Oh!  I like flowers!” The girl smiled innocently.  “I know just the place!”  She skipped away, and took the hand of Bi-Curious Luke, and they left the room, with the boy giving them a nervous wave good-bye.<br />
<br />
<br />
And then Cole woke up for real, still a little girl in Lee&#39;s arms.  “Oh.  Wow.  That was a trip.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed it was.”  Lee stroked Cole&#39;s hair.  “How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“Still not sure we should have been there...but setting that little girl free was a good thing, wasn&#39;t it?”  Cole bit her lip.<br />
<br />
“It could be.  Only time will tell.  He may not be able to handle those feelings, just like your Aunt.  He&#39;ll need a good friend.”<br />
<br />
Cole smiled.  “I can do that!”  Then she had a thought and reached down between her legs.  “Oh..that part was real.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed it was.  Ready to try kissing?”  Lee chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Eep.  Yes?  But where&#39;s Tara...I mean, Winrya?”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s on her way here, don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be seeing her again soon.  Now, do you want to try it like this, or should I make you older?”  Lee said.<br />
<br />
“Um...we can try it this way first...”  Cole blushed, looking up at her Mistress.</p>
