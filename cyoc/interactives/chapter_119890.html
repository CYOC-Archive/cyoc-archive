<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I arrived home to the small apartment within a large apartment building that Tabitha and I shared.  It wasn&#39;t in the greatest part of town.  I was tired from the crazy day I&#39;d had so far so I laid down for a nap while waiting for Tabitha to get back from class.<br />
<br />
I woke up to the noise of Tabitha moving around in the apartment.  &quot;Oh, Joe!  I&#39;m glad you&#39;re awake!&quot; she said.  &quot;I think it&#39;s time we discuss a few changes that are going to happen with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
My heart sunk.  She wasn&#39;t dumping me was she?  I asked her that straight out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Don&#39;t be silly!  It&#39;s nothing like that!&quot; she exclaimed.  I was relieved, but wary.<br />
<br />
She sat down next to me on the bed.  &quot;Joe, I know you&#39;re deepest desires, and I have for a long time.  It was good of you to bring them up with me early on.  Since then, I&#39;ve tried really hard to be supportive of you.  But lately I&#39;ve been thinking that&#39;s not enough.  Starting now, today, I want to take a more active role in your fantasies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Really?&quot; I stuttered out, unsure of how to feel.  Part of me was elated, and another part was terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; she said matter-of-factly.  I&#39;m doing it for you, yes, but I want you to know that I&#39;m doing it for me too.  I&#39;ve grown to share in and be excited a bit by your unusual interests, and I want to be part of them, for both of us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done to start out.&quot;  She pulled a bag onto the bed that had been resting nearby.  It was a pink striped bag with the label &quot;Nicoletta&#39;s Secret&quot; on it.  She started pulling items out.  They were all panties, in various colors, but all of them extremely girly.  Most had lace and fringe, some with cute hearts or ribbon.  Some were plain except fot the color.  There were various styles and fabrics.  Normal, bikini-style, hip-huggers, thongs, g-strings, they were all there.  I looked at Tabitha questioningly.<br />
<br />
In response to my look, she said &quot;I&#39;ve thrown out all of your old underwear.  This is your new underwear.  From now on the only underwear you will wear are women&#39;s panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!  Are you crazy?!  I can&#39;t wear these!&quot; I shouted angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can and you will!&quot; she responded indignantly.  &quot;Don&#39;t even pretend I don&#39;t know that you are excited by this.  I can see it right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
She was right.  Though I had responded defiantly I had secretly longed to wear women&#39;s clothing for a long time.  And right then my dick had grown hard and was bulging in my pants.  I continued protesting a bit, but she argued back very effectively and quickly shut down any last resistance I harbored.<br />
<br />
At her bidding, I stripped off my pants and underwear.  She took them, my last pair of boxers, from me and made to exit the bedroom.  She turned before stepping out and said to me &quot;I love you Joe.  I know you want this.  Please, choose a pair you like and put them on.  You may put your normal pants back on over them.  Please put the rest of them into your drawer.  They are yours to keep now.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She then left the room.  I could hear the lid of the trashcan in our little kitchenette open, followed by the rustle of plastic as she changed the trash bag.  Then I heard the apartment door open and shut, and I knew she was taking my male underwear out to the dumpster.<br />
<br />
I sat contemplating my future pantied fate.  I didn&#39;t want to admit it right then, but I was so happy and excited.  After a few moments, I selected a hot pink satin pair of panties with lace trim and a little ribbon bow.  I stepped into them and pulled them up tight against my crotch.  My dick was ready to explode, but I held it in.  I put my pants on over them and went out to the front room.<br />
<br />
Tabitha returned a moment later.  She said &quot;I&#39;m glad we can do this together, baby.  But this isn&#39;t all.  Over time I think we&#39;ll start changing your bathroom products to women&#39;s ones, having you shave your whole body, wearing other women&#39;s clothes, painting your nails, doing your hair and make-up... everything.  But for now, we&#39;ll start with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
My breathing quickened, but I said nothing, just contemplating.  It was shocking and seemed difficult, but it was like a dream come true.  Tabitha had read my feelings and fetishes, and not just been okay with them, but actively pursued them with me.<br />
<br />
Then she said, &quot;Now, I&#39;m tired of living in this old apartment.  Your parents have a nice house in the suburbs.  We&#39;re going to go live there!&quot;<br />
<br />
I protested again.  &quot;No way!  I am not going to live with my parents!  I couldn&#39;t wait to get out from under their thumb; I&#39;m not going back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Joe,&quot; she reassured, &quot;it won&#39;t be like it was before.  We&#39;re going to use that magic ring of yours to help improve the situation.  That will be fun, won&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
It did sound like fun.  Rather than offer a long-winded argument this time, I relented.  If she was right about the panties, then I was sure she would be right about this as well.  I only had one point of contention.  &quot;What about this apartment?  We&#39;re just going to skip out on our lease?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you use your ring to come up with a creative and sexy solution to the problem?&quot; Tabitha suggested.  &quot;How about something involving bringing our jerk landlord down a peg.  I thought for a bit, then came up with something good.  The landlord and his wife, other than being jerks to their tenants, were really into horses.  They owned several that they kept at a local stables.  I began to wish with the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that my current landlord was very sexually attracted to horse stallions, and that stallions were attracted to him as well.  I wish that when he has an opportunity, he would visit them or bring one to his home for the purpose of making love to them and having them fuck his ass.  I wish that he would enjoy being fucked by horse stallions and that he would train his asshole to be able to take enormous cocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I continued &quot;I wish that his wife was a professional dominatrix.  I wish that she would live apart from him due to his amorous equine relationships, but that she would remain married to him for convenience and money.  I wish she stayed in this apartment, and that our lease is released without penalty, and that she would use the apartment as a professional studio to dominate clients.&quot;<br />
<br />
Going further I wished: &quot;I wish that the landlady dominatrix was good at all kinds of dominating and was turned on by it, but I wish that her particular specialty was pony play, and that this was her preferred method of domination and that it would turn her on greatly.  I wish that the landlord, when he had spare time, would enjoy visiting his dominatrix wife here and having her dominate him with pony play.&quot;<br />
<br />
I concluded &quot;I wish that the landlord and landlady were happy in their new lives, and that happiness would mean that they were kind and considerate of other people, especially their tenants.  In particular, as a bonus for living in their apartment complex, they would each allow a service once a month.  I wish that once a month the landlord would allow any tenant if they desired to fuck and ravage his asshole with a cock or any toy, within a sexual theme of the tenant&#39;s preference, and that the landlady would once a month offer to any tenant a free domination session in which the tenant was allowed to choose how to be dominated.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that I was done.  Tabitha gaped at me, impressed.  &quot;Well we don&#39;t live here anymore, but all that got me really horny!&quot; she said happily.  &quot;I think we&#39;ll have to come visit from time to time so we can see the results!  But for now, we&#39;ll leave this place much happier than it was before, and we&#39;ll make ourselves a happy home at your parents&#39;.  Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
And off we went.</p>
