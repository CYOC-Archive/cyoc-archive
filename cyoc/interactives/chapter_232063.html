<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It’s funny,” Lightning smiling as he stares at April. The two Centaurs had a short walk away from the village square were they and the halflings were present. Witnessing many transformations into centaurs; his former mistress Lucy, experiencing his own, along with Amanda in the church. The dark furred horse with a dark tanned human torso of India ethnicity smiled; exposing brilliant white teeth. The grin was almost Cheshire, but soft; no ill intent present.<br />
“What is funny,” April asking, still getting used to her more human sounding voice; finding it more melodious and feminine then the deep slow drawl she had when she first gain sentience early in the day. She was once a white furred horse of similar breed to Lighting. Her new upper human torso was European Caucasian; her brilliant blonde hair suggests Danish ancestry, but her accent had a subtle French lilt to it. Her green eyes displayed her naiveté as she stared into Lightning’s own brown eyes.<br />
“That we are the complete opposite in both fur and skin,” Lightning gently cupping April’s hands; giving them a gentle squeeze; “yet so alike in every way.”<br />
<br />
“How do you mean,” April finding Lightning’s gentleness to being quite a turn on. She agreed to join Lightning with a stroll as she wanted to get use to her new body. Finding her new vision more forward focus than eyes wide set for more panoramic viewing suited to a horse living on the plains. The new positioning allowed her to focus on a single point in front of her more easily. Her keen sense of smell is still the same; however she has to close an eye to focus on her new petite human nose.<br />
“We were both born a horse,” Lightning closing his eyes; “we only had simple means. Eat sleep and run.”<br />
“You forgot about breeding,” April adding before seeing Lightning grimace in disappointment.<br />
“I was gelded,” Lightning answering; the hurt in his eyes as he relives and old memory. “Shortly after I was weaned from my mother, the breeders, they took me to a different barn and did something painful to me.”<br />
“Oh my,” April putting a hand to her new mouth in shock<br />
“As I grew from yearling to stallion,” Lightning lamenting; “I watch my mother being mounted and bred by a different stallion then the one that sired me. I knew instinctively in my head that, that is what I was supposed to do; however the drive and desire was not there. It wasn’t until Lucy acquired me that I found out why I couldn’t mount a mare and sire a foal,” Lightning taking a deep breath; “I had by balls removed, or gelded as some man I can’t remember say.”<br />
“How horrible,” April looking stunned; “but tell me, how does it mean we are alike?”<br />
“Because when I became a centaur,” Lightning smiling; “I felt something returning to me as I transformed. I wasn’t certain then but when I recently talked to my former,” Lightning pausing; “sorry, I meant to say Lucy. I’m still finding difficult to refer to Lucy without the honorific of mistress.”<br />
“I’m feeling the same with Jenny,” April nodding; “these new human thoughts are confusing. But you still haven’t…”<br />
“I’m getting there,” Lightning nodding; “when I talked to Lucy she remarked about needing someone to love. Then it hit me, that tingling I felt when I became this handsome centaur stallion. It was my balls growing back. I suspect you were also,” again Lightning pausing as he tries to find the right word; “fixed, like me?”<br />
<br />
“You mean,” April looking stunned; “unable to mate?”<br />
“I noticed the same look in you that I had, when seeing other mares being bred,” Lightning shaking his head; “oh this is stupid.”<br />
Lightning gets up on his hooves, feeling ashamed that he took April to a spot behind the grain mill, feeling ashamed at reliving a painful truth.<br />
“Wait,” April getting up as well; “don’t go. I wasn&#39;t harmed the way you were. I had an illness when I was a filly,” This time it was April’s turn to grasp’s the dark skin and dark furred centaur’s hands. “An animal doctor,” April looking into Lightning’s eyes; “operated on me. He removed a mass from my womb. I think the human’s,” April tilting her head in thought; “called it cancer. It would have killed me.”<br />
“And it made you barren,” Lightning sighing before perking up; “unless.”<br />
“Unless what,” April looking at Lightning curiously.<br />
“We test a theory,” Lightning smiling as he extends a hand to cup April’s face; slowly dragging the hand down to caress her check as he trails past her throat. He brushes his hand over one of April’s new breasts; feeling the nipple through the silk garment as he teases the sensitive flesh, Lightning smiles as April makes an audible gasp in pleasure. <br />
“That felt good, didn’t it,” Lightning now sliding his hand down her abdomen; reaching to the edge were human flesh merges with equine fur before slowly moving his hand up; making her shudder at the sensual touching.<br />
<br />
“Oh my,” April breathing hard; she wasn’t sure but she did feel a stirring deep within her. A sensation she has not felt before. Before she knew it, Lightning was already removing the buttons off of Jenny’s blouse; allowing her breasts to burst free from their silky confines and stand stiff in the cool night air.<br />
“I smell your arousal,” Lightning feeling his shaft enlarge and stiffen; the sensation was foreign just as it was thrilling.<br />
“I smell yours as well,” April unable to deny these new feelings as Lightning&#39;s musky scent scrambles her brain with lust. She mashes her body towards Lightning embracing him as he moves in with a kiss. Running her hands up and down his back; tussling his mane with her fingers as she wrestles with his tongue in her mouth.<br />
“You would be my first,” Lightning pull back to take a breath; their heady scents mingling in the night air.<br />
“The same,” April shucking off the blouse; allowing it fall to the ground as she bucks and kicks in excitement while Lightning works his way behind her. Seeing his pink mottled shaft swinging stiffly under him makes her pant with need as he pulls out of view her view Going on instinct that are both new and old, April has her tail off to the side as she feels Lightning tracing the edges of her engorged vulva. She shakes at the intimate touch as her hind legs get damp from her juices leaking from a winking entrance. &quot;But we&#39;ll also be each others only,&quot; April letting the thought of being mates hang in the air.<br />
<br />
“Do I have permission,” Lightning panting hard; the urge to mount and plow her insides evident in his timbre.<br />
“Yes. Mate with me,” April trotting about; leaning up against the mill as she hears him whinnying as he rears up and places his massive weight on her flanks. She grunts as Lightning makes several thrusts; missing the mark, he adjusts slightly and both cry out in pleasure as his next thrust hits true, burying his hard shaft inside her as he eagerly works towards climax.<br />
<br />
“Oooooooooooooooo,” April moaning as her vaginal walls grip Lightning as he thrusts deeper in her. Feeling every vein and every bump of the massive phallus her body was working to milk as it spread her insides wide and she was enjoying every minute of it.<br />
“Keep going,” April panting; feeling both of her hearts beating in time with Lightning’s thrusting; “by Epona this feels good!”<br />
“Yes,” Lightning grunting as he picks up the pace. Tightening his grip with his forelegs; the centaur stallion leans forwards and starts to pull April’s upper torso towards him. His thrusting getting more force full as his breath hits one of April’s pointed ears. “Almost there,” Lightning gasping as he feels a clenching sensation in his testicles, racing through him. He cries out with joy as he cums in the willing mare below him; feeling and experiencing for the first time what mating is like.<br />
<br />
“Oooooooooooooooooo,” April shaking as she felt Lightning’s flatten head flare at the entrance to her womb; the shaft quivering as a warm liquid was forcibly pumped in her; feeling her first ever orgasm, she shuddered in place as she felt herself feeling full and satisfied for the first time. Sparks dancing within the edge of her vision as she slowly comes down from the body racking high she just experienced.<br />
“Thank you my goddess,” Lightning smiling as he stays mounted to April; enjoying the afterglow of his first rut.<br />
“I want to stay like this,” April noticing Lightning had his hands gripping her human torso; “but we should get back to the Halflings. I hope to at least witness Jenny becoming a herd sister.”<br />
“Yes,” Lightning pulling himself off April; the sound of his slick phallus existing April’s entrance made him sigh in satisfaction; seeing his seed spilling out of April along with her juices made him exhale in contentment. Then the tingling in his head distracted him; affirmations about who they were and that they are effectively centaur in both mind body and soul. April turning around; her green eyes no longer displaying a naiveté expression of confusion.  They were confident, exuding knowledge that she never had before. Smiling as she picks up Jenny’s blouse and tosses it back on, albeit mud stained from her hooves as she accidentally stomped on it through her excitement.<br />
“You need help with that,” Lightning offering a hand.<br />
“I got it,” April deftly buttoning up the garment as if she was always wearing shirts; “I feel as if Epona wanted us to mate, to give us a second chance.”<br />
“That and she wanted us to heal each other,” Lightning walking side by side with his mate; feeling Epona’s loving embrace as he got a feeling from her. “Our goddess wants us to hurry back,” Lightning kicking his hooves into a brisk trot; causing April to keep pace as he quickly heads back to the town square; “Zoey and Pegasus have just become members of the Haras. Jenny and Sandy are next,” Lightning calmly stating as he relays Epona’s message.<br />
“Then let’s not waste any time,” April feeling ecstatic; “I want to be the first to welcome Jenny as a fellow herd sister.”<br />
“And there is someone I owe an apology to,” Lightning pursing his lips; regretting the lie he made in anger to the deputy about having a mate.</p>
