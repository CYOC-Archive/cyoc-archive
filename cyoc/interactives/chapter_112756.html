<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason and Luke feel asleep on the same bed that night. Jason was nestled in Luke&#39;s muscular arms and they both dreamed of each other. Jason woke first and was able to gaze at the angle sleeping in his bed. He was so cute when he was asleep he thought. Jason kissed Luke on his lips and then from his cheek to his nipple. Luke woke up and kissed Jason in return. He told Jason to take care of his morning wood. Jason was happy to oblige. Afterwards both parties got dressed and left the room to attend there classes.<br />
 <br />
Jason ran up to walk Olivia to class. Olivia and Jason held hands as they made there way up the steps to the door where they parted ways to their respective assigned seats. Lucky for Jason he was able to sit with the only other soccer player on the team James.<br />
James was a little shorter than Jason. He had rusty brown hair and was as thin as a stick. He had little muscles definition and even less body hair. He was extremely fast and had mastered faking out players on the field. He walked over and sat down next to James. The professer walked in and started to blabber about political science. Jason looked over at Riley who shared his expression of boredom. <br />
<br />
After what seemed like and enternity Jason looked at the clock and was shocked. After what seemed like an hour of taking notes was represented as 11 minutes. Jason wondered how he was going to pass the time. <br />
Then he rembered he has the chrovonic. He reached into his backpack and pulled it out. He typed in a few buttons and aimed it at himself and James. A small white flash went unnoticed to James but Jason watch it with inticipation. Both Jason and James had turned invisible. He silently showed James and explained the chrovonic. The quickly grabbed thier bags and headed out the back unnoticed to anyone. They went up a stair well for three floors. Down a hall way, Into a janitor room up a ladder down a small hole and in between a wall. They finally opened a secret hidden door and came into a room full of boxes. It was about 15 feet long and 18 feet wide. A door was at the other end. Carpet was on the floor and a series of couches and chairs lined the bottom of the shelves packed with boxes. <br />
&quot; what&#39;s is this place &quot; James asked wide eyed.<br />
&quot; it&#39;s the records room for the college. They keep all the information they can find on students in a few rooms around the campus. But that&#39;s not why we are here. You know the soccer team had a big game coming up. Well as head of the team I have taken it upon myself to get us in complete physical readiness for the game. As captain I have vowed to keep that streak immortal and I will not be the reason for it to cease. We can&#39;t have any inaccuracies on the team. You need to be in shape. You need to be bigger. You need to be stronger. You need to be more muscular. You need to be older. You need to be a man.&quot; Jason told him<br />
&quot; and that cube thing will do it?&quot;<br />
&quot; you are god dam right it will! Jason shouted<br />
&quot; Strip done now! &quot; Jason barked<br />
James quickly undid his pants pulled them down and took off his shirt and pulled off both shoes to leave him naked except for his underwear. Jason ordered him to take that off as well. <br />
A thin pale hairless frame was displayed. Even his balls and dick were small and almost hairless. His dick was bright pink and was shriveled up. <br />
&quot; Your body is impure you need to become a man! &quot; Jason shouted.<br />
Instead of setting many changes Jason just typed in &quot; man&quot; and it obeyed. A white flash enveloped James. The changes were slow his but got gradually he hairier and more muscular. He filled out and looked a little order around twenty one . His changes weren&#39;t stopping. To see if he truly was a man Jason presented his bare ass to James to see if he truly could be dominant. James lept onto Jason and fucked him long and hard. Jason could feel James&#39;s Dick growing wider and longer inside his ass. When he climaxed and looked over he looked to be around 25 and was still getting hairer. <br />
Jason told him that he should go rest and txt him tomorrow after the change stopped. Then he would revert him back to a younger age. <br />
<br />
The next afternoon Jason was text a picture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The following words shocked him. <br />
&quot; Hey Jason i couldn&#39;t be happier. You transformation hasn&#39;t stopped. I keep getting more hair and age. I was in my late twenties when you left me and this morning I was in my thirties now I&#39;m in my late forties. I hope to be in my sixties by tomorrow. I&#39;ve met a rich buisness man today and he has fell in love with me and my cock. I know it has only been a day but he and I are in love. He&#39;s fine with how many twinks I fuck. I love my muscles and fat and hair. I just want more and more and more. My dick is now bigger than a wine bottle. I&#39;m even getting patches of grey here and there. I don&#39;t ever want to be young again. I feel so powerful and tough now that I&#39;m on this manly body. Turn some other college student into a soccer player becuase I never want to go back. My world is even changing around me apparently I own a very wealthy buisness that deals with making leather articles of clothing. And I&#39;m adressed as sir I have even started talking with a Scottish accent. I&#39;m sorry this is so sudden but I want to say good bye old friend and thank you. &quot;</p>
