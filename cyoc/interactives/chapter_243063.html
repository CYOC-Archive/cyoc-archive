<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn&#39;t take him long, or much of his regressed brain capacity, to decide he didn&#39;t want to remain the way he was. Figuring he didn&#39;t have long before Felicity came to looking for him, Theodor scrolled through the information on the computer screen. Searching for any clue to tell him where it&#39;d gone wrong, why he&#39;d been turned into a girl of five instead of a five-year-old boy, he found the biggest complication to everything was his own thought power.<br />
<br />
Coming to realise more and more it had regressed like the rest of him, his five-year-old mind struggled to understand a lot of what it was on the screen, as well as work out how best to undo it. It was at this point Theodor grasped something new. Searching his profile, he was continuously confronted by his own mind rebelling, insisting he was the person he now was, he ought to leave the computer alone, as he wasn&#39;t to touch it when mommy wasn&#39;t around, as well as what he really wanted to do was go watch cartoons with his sister. Fighting against these and other intrusive, errant thoughts, Theodor kicked his legs back and forth and scrolled. Coming back to the point of the timer, he stared at it as it counted backwards, and after a moment, wondered, &quot;What would happen if I cancel it. Would I go back to being Felicity&#39;s daddy? Or would I be stuck as Kris?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind insisted he wasn&#39;t his sister&#39;s daddy, and daddy had left some time after Felicity had been born, Theodor was bothered by these thoughts. Moving the mouse over to click on the area which would end the timer, he paused. Thinking, &quot;There has to be another way to make things go back to how they were,&quot; and about to go try looking elsewhere in the information, he yanked his hand away from the mouse when out in the hall, he heard Felicity call, &quot;Kris?&quot; as before him the computer screen blinked.<br />
<br />
About to tell the other girl she&#39;d be with her in a moment, unaware she&#39;d just experienced a shift in how she perceived herself, Kris watched as the information on the screen began to become scrambled. As it did so, she was suddenly overcome with a series of discomforts as she began to transform and reality changed around her. Her nightgown shrinking until it became a cute, short-sleeve shirt with an image of a kawaii otter on the front and her panties became a pair of sleeper shorts, she herself began to age. Going from age five to twenty-one in a matter of minutes, she gasped as her height increased to four-foot eight-inches whilst her weight made jumps upward until it settled at about a hundred and seventeen. As this occurred, her chest pushed out into a pair of firm B cups whilst the rest of her body experienced the normal processes of puberty, short of her getting her period right then and there.<br />
<br />
But, as if it wasn&#39;t enough, her mind also leapt forth sixteen years, and she was suddenly overcome with knowledge of attending primary school, secondary school, graduating, and starting at a university, as well as all new memories of growing up female. And then, as she figured it was over, even as the office changed around her to become a dorm room, she grimaced as the new memories she had altered even further as she recalled her named was Christina Channers, everyone called her either Tia or C C, before it all went weird.<br />
<br />
The transformation still continuing, Tia gasped out and shifted in place as she felt a pinched sensation in her tailbone. As this happened, her feet began to morph and fur started to sprout across her body. Four extra nipples formed, and as her face pushed out into a muzzle and she began to look like an anthropomorphic beagle, she recalled how, at the age of eleven or twelve, she had started to look less and less human, but more as what she now appeared as. And as her body went through puberty, she was horrified and terrified by now only how she was turning into a humanoid dog, but also by the fact nobody but her could see her as what she was becoming. Wanting to howl in despair, even as the Chronivac disappeared off her laptop, Tia instead shivered as her tail grew in and poked out one of the leg holes of her sleeper shorts.<br />
<br />
Whilst all this was happening, Felicity, who&#39;d come looking for her sister, stopped, leaned back against the wall, and slid to the floor. Convulsing as if she was having a seizure, she articulated a strange gurgling sound as she began to transform. Aging, she went from four to that of a teenager within seconds. As this happened, the hallway around her shifted as reality for her rearranged itself to accommodate who she was becoming. Night clothes becoming jeans, t-shirt, socks, boxers, she soon looked less and less like a little girl and more like a teenage boy as her hair shortened, shifted hue, and her face took on a more angular, masculine appearance. Gasping as new memories invaded her mind, she spread her legs as her ovaries pushed their way down, then out of her body and into a developing flesh sack, all whilst her urethra and clitoris merged and lengthened into a cock.<br />
<br />
It taking minutes, but soon where a little girl had been there was now a teenage boy. Blinking as his new reality cemented itself, Alan couldn&#39;t understand why it was he was lying on the floor of the hall. Pushing himself up, he looked about. Forgetting everything which had happened to him, the sleep over he&#39;d decided to crash, what he and his friend Jeff had did with a computer programme, anything about Felicity Blythe, the teenage boy headed downstairs. Remembering only the life he now lived, oblivious to how, in an hour or so, he&#39;d head over to Jeff&#39;s place, and what they&#39;d do, and set in motion, when his best mate told him about the Chronivac, Alan headed for the kitchen to find himself a snack, figuring he might be hungry and this was why he&#39;d dropped to the hall floor, all as he muttered, &quot;Damn blood sugar levels must be getting too low.&quot;</p>
