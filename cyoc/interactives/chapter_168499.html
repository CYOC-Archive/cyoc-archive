<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> &quot;Him.&quot; You at Pete with a shaking hand.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; The devil looked upset. Maybe he saw your decision as some kind of show of pity for Pete. Something that ,in part, was true. He was dead anyway. But at least you could make sure that his suffering ended. It was more than he had a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
 Asroth gaze at you with contempt for a moment that seemed like an eternity, Meanwhile, the grip of her tail on you had been reinforced. Yo think ,terrified, that the succubus would continue to squeeze you until your bones were reduced to dust. From the look of the succubus, she seemed to be considering that option.<br />
<br />
The moment passes.<br />
<br />
 The devil&#39;s face relaxes and sets you free. You fall to the ground with your body still aching from the pressure to which it had been subjected. The tail that had kept you imprisoned recoiled between Asroth´s clothes.<br />
<br />
 A pair of Gloved hands clapped behind you.<br />
<br />
 &quot;If we are done with this charade…&quot; After it was clear that the decision had already been made, the titan made a gesture with his hand towards something beyond the hole. Armored figures proceeded down the hole in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
 You don´t have time to think about what was about to happen since you feel the Sucubuss whispering in your ear. &quot;Whatever pathetic pity you think you are giving him, I assure you that he will not get it.&quot; The mask had He disappeared again leaving only a voice hard as stone. &quot;You&#39;ve only condemn him to another type of particular hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
 As if to make her point, her tail slid back from between the succubus skirts and it snapped the air. The stinger seemed to glow deadly at the end of it.<br />
<br />
 The devil, without letting her smile leave her face, takes you by the hand and leads you in front of Pete&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Come on, honey&quot; You could hear your companions pleading behind your back &quot;It&#39;s time to start.&quot;<br />
<br />
 That chuckle was starting to make you nervous.<br />
<br />
 The tail that had held you until a moment ago  tensed, turned 180 degrees and, with unheard-of speed, it dug into Pete&#39;s stomach. He could only emit a moan drowned by the blood that began to flow from his mouth. There is nothing you can do but stay totally still while a chill runs down your spine. Asroth put a hand on your shoulder in a false gesture of compassion. <br />
<br />
 &quot;As I told you…&quot;Her voice could be that of a viper, playing with its prey.<br />
<br />
 Please, you implore, end him quickly.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I take my time with my victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Your hopes of giving Pete a quick death were burned to ashes by Asroth&#39;s cruel words. The stinger came out with a liquid sound, leaving a dark wound, surrounded by little veins that were taking on the same sickly color.<br />
<br />
 With her free hand, the succubus gestured towards the postrated man, who began to flail and contort in an unnatural way, a cry of pain strangled in his throat as blood continued to gush out of his mouth. You noticed how a series of dark lines began to form throughout his body and some strange lumps began to run through them. It takes you a moment to realize what it was all about.<br />
<br />
 Those lines ... are veins. So what should be moving through them is ...<br />
<br />
 Blood ... The blood was moving from within his body and was pouring out of every wound, pore and orifice in his body. Forming a puddle on the ground. But the blood kept moving in an alien way, climbing the wall of the cell where it began to form three interlocking triangles surrounded by a circle. All this while his body contorted in a horrible way without being able to fall into the unconsciousness .<br />
<br />
You hear a hungry bark behind you, while deep laughters began to resonate from the throats of those creatures, drowning out the screams of terror from your cellmates.<br />
<br />
 A sound escaped from between the woman&#39;s thin lips. The sound grew in intensity. You end up recognizing it as some kind of chant in a foreign language. It echoed in the back of the makeshift cell and seemed to muffle any other noise. The black flame above her head burned whit fierceness, But instead of light up the room, it seemed to darken that corner of the world more and more.<br />
<br />
 Her chant seemed to react with the blood on the wall, which began to form a series of symbols unknown to you.<br />
<br />
 Pete&#39;s body seemed to have reached its limit and now lay motionless on the concrete floor. You hoped that he had finally found peace. Or at least, that he awas in a deep coma. Meanwhile, the rest of his blood continued to gush out ,impassive at the pain of it´s former owner, and now drifted to your feet.<br />
<br />
 The blood formed a circle around you. When that happened, Asroth stopped her chant and stepped back. She seemed to be expecting something to happen.<br />
<br />
 The blood began to rise in the air forming a cloud of dark red that swirled around you, sticking to your clothes and skin. That liquid, you noted, was cold as ice. You tried to move, disgusted, but your body seemed to have stuck to the ground. You felt a warm touch on your back and some hands settled on your hips. That body was abnormally hot, so much so that the mere contact was starting to burn you. You tried to shake yourself out of that hug but your pathetic attempt to separate yourself from the succubus had only caused her to hold you even closer ,firmly. Asroth possessed an abnormal strength despite her external appearance.<br />
<br />
 The room was completely silent, now. An unknown object touched your left foot but you ignore it. You don&#39;t want to look at it, fearing what it might be.<br />
<br />
 The sticky Blood had covered you from your feet to the neck and it looked like it wasn&#39;t going to stop until your entire body was covered entirely. You try to close your eyes and hold your breath. It was only a matter of seconds before the blood covered your face. Asroth seemed amused with your attitude.<br />
<br />
 &quot;You should try to relax my dear. Any resistance you put up is useless now.&quot; She seemed to delight in the fear that emanated from your body.&quot; Once you are one of us, you won&#39;t have to worry that those you care about most will hurt you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
 As the blood began to spread down your face, Asroth nibbled your left ear with those sharp fangs, if your mouth was not covered with that blood you would have screamed. The devil gave you one last message before you were completely covered by blood, one last sentence that would mark your destiny forever. &quot;When you are a succubus, you will be the one who hurts them. And the best of all? You will enjoy every second of that glorious pain that you will cause to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The laughter coming from that being was cruel.<br />
<br />
 You could feel how that unholy substance is introduced through all the orifices of your body, you taste something metallic entering your mouth and a scream is drowned in the depths of your throat.<br />
<br />
 Then you sink into a blessed unconsciousness.</p>
