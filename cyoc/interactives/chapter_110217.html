<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frozen like a statue, the boy was completely motionless in the middle of the lawn. He was wearing a gray t shirt, blue skinny jeans, white sneakers and a red cap covered his blond hair.<br />
&quot;Is he still alive?&quot; Asked his little brother to the other kids.<br />
&quot;Of course, he is just immobile.&quot; The girl said. &quot;He can hear us, and saw us... oops. Wait a second&quot; She flipped his hand and the frozen boy turned to see the kids. &quot;I just don&#39;t want him to talk because I&#39;m tired of yellings and offenses.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you make him older?&quot; The boy asked her.<br />
&quot;Sure, how old is he?&quot; She asked him.<br />
&quot;Ten&quot; The boy said. &quot;Can you make him twelve?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; She smiled and then focused her sight in the frozen boy. Almost inapreciable, the boy grew a few inches, his t shirt and jeans looked a little bit tighter and a watch popped out from his left wrist. &quot;He&#39;s twelve now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; A boy said. &quot;He looks almost the same. I thought that he would become bigger and hairier like other big boys.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think that growing is a slow process.&quot; A girl said. &quot;It could take years to be as big as those guys you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then made it faster!&quot; A boy shouted. &quot;Make him grow twelve years right now!&quot;<br />
The girl with magic powers made a annoyed gesture and granted the wish. The frozen boy went to a sudden rush of growing up that burst out from his body like a bomb, tearing his sleeves and his jeans&#39;s lower section as his arms and legs grew some muscles in them.<br />
The girls looked how his face turned squarer and with a subtle facial hair, his nose grew a little more prominent and his eyebrows got thicker. They were amazed when some big toes came out from the now small sneakers. Those feet should be bigger than their heads!<br />
On the other hand, boys were looking how hair began to sprout all over his body. The now exposed arms and legs were getting covered in a dense fur that hid in his clothes remains. They knew from his dads and older brothers that under that clothes he had grown hairy armpits, chest, butt and most important, a messy bush above his pee pee. Talking about it, his penis was hardly contained in the remains of those jeans which were sporting a very decent bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that he is old enough I will unfreeze him.&quot; Said the girl and the young man began to move again.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He asked confused. &quot;What are you looking freaks? Is that you haven&#39;t seen a boy before?&quot; Then, he realized that his voice sounded different, too deep to sound like a kid. &quot;What?!! Aaaaahhh!!! What happened to me?!!! I&#39;m older!!&quot;<br />
&quot;My... boy...&quot; The hairy father said between sobs. &quot;How do you dare...&quot;<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; The young man said. &quot;Why did you look smaller? Am I as tall as you now?&quot; He tried to walk to his father but he slipped with his teared sneakers. &quot;My feet... they look like yours...&quot;<br />
Both men hugged each other for a long time and some tears were visible in their faces during that. They really looked regretful. A few girls were crying a little, including the one with the magic powers. They were feeling bad for them, maybe they weren&#39;t as bad as they thought. But, then they began to hear some shouts.<br />
&quot;Awww! He didn&#39;t get as big as I thought!&quot; A boy said.<br />
&quot;Make him bigger!&quot; &quot;Make him hairier!&quot; &quot;Grow his pee pee!&quot; &quot;Take off his clothes!&quot; The other boys begin to shout. The magic girl looked really annoyed with them.<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; She said. &quot;I will do it!&quot; And the young man clothes vanished in the air, his average body pumped to weightlifting proportions and thick hair began to cover it. Finally his now exposed average dick pumped until it looked like a fat salami.<br />
&quot;Eww! He looks gross! Hehehehe!&quot; A boy grinned.<br />
&quot;And you too.&quot; The girl said.<br />
Suddenly all the boys bursted out from their clothes as they turned into hairy and big men. They were so surprised of it that get motionless after that. The girls saw how they turned as big and hairy as they wanted to turn the father and the son, they looked twenty years older from their original ages. Some were sporting trimmed bears and some others bowling ball biceps but all of them had stinky messy armpits and wild bushes above their anormal phytons.<br />
&quot;What did you do?!!&quot; A man who the girl assumed was the little son yelled. &quot;I want to make my dad and brother big and hairier not me! I don&#39;t like to be this big, I reek and my pee pee is too heavy!&quot;<br />
The other men began to yell after him with their now deep voices.<br />
&quot;I saw that you were as mean as that father and his son.&quot; The girl said. &quot;So, I assumed that you deserved the same punishment.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I can&#39;t be this big!&quot; A boy said. &quot;I won&#39;t fit in my clothes anymore!&quot;<br />
&quot;My bed will be so small!&quot; &quot;My pee pee can&#39;t stop bouncing!&quot; &quot;What is this clear thing that comes out from my pee pee?!&quot; The other men began to yell too.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not my problem.&quot; The girl said. &quot;I&#39;m a spirit of justice in this town. My only duty is to punish the bad people and I realized you were bad. So you will have to live in the adult world since now!&quot; After saying that she dissappeared in the air like a ghost. The other girls who were near to her ran away scared leaving the group of naked hairy men in the middle of the street.<br />
&quot;Son?&quot; The hairy man said.<br />
&quot;Little bro?&quot; The other hairy man said too.<br />
&quot;Dad, brother. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; The hairy young man said. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to be spanked and I behave so selfish after that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, son.&quot; The father said. &quot;You&#39;re not a kid anymore. I won&#39;t spank you again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, little bro or I mean just bro.&quot; The brother said. &quot;We sorry to be so bad with you.&quot;<br />
Tears began to appear in the former boy&#39;s face and then he ran to hug his brother and father.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, son.&quot; The father said. &quot;Since now, we will be more united. We can start by sharing my clothes with you! Although I don&#39;t know if they will fit you! You&#39;re huge! Hahahaha&quot;<br />
&quot;That sounds good to me.&quot; The eldest son said. &quot;And some shoes too. I&#39;m litteraly a foot long! Hahahaha&quot;<br />
They began to walk to their house when the former kid turned back to the other disoriented men in the street.<br />
&quot;You can come too! Tonight is men&#39;s night! Hahahaha!&quot;</p>
