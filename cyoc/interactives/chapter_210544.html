<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I see no problem with that.&quot; Margaret decided after a moment of thought. &quot;All right. Private Waters will be dosed with the yellow serum this time. Unless there are any objections?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin shook his head. &quot;Not from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man really wanted to see Nikki get bigger. He&#39;d thought it over last night, but now he was one hundred percent certain that he liked muscular girls. The attraction to fit, strong women had always been there. Was it because of his mom being toned, thus leading to his development of an Oedipus complex, as theorized by Freud? Maybe. Or maybe he just thought female muscles were sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not. If anything, this will be an educative opportunity.&quot; Abrams relented.<br />
<br />
Naturally, Nikki was ecstatic. The buff soldier remained in place, standing at attention with her sinewy back straight, but you couldn&#39;t miss the excited glint in her eyes.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t return to the laboratory. Instead, doctor Abrams disappeared for a while, before returning with a vial in hand. The scene reminded Justin of yesterday. There was a stark difference, though. The serum inside the vial was yellow. Not blue. So it was far more potent, which is how he&#39;d designed the formula to work. And Nikki was also not as small as she used to be. She&#39;d never been small to begin with, considering her previous physique. Now, however, she already resembled a female bodybuilder who was about to start competing.<br />
<br />
Abrams stepped forward, offering the vial. &quot;You know the procedure, private. Just drink it down and wait for the drug to take effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, doc. Bottoms up!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall woman eagerly drank from the vial, gulping down every drop of growth-inducing formula. She almost dropped it afterward. Nikki smiled in anticipation; she was looking forward to this the most, followed by Justin who kept his eyes on her at all times.<br />
<br />
Like before, the transformation was instantaneous.<br />
<br />
Nikki gritted her teeth as veins started spreading across her skin. Enhanced nutrients flowed through them, reaching her tendons and sinews. Muscles began pumping up, growing bigger as if by magic.<br />
<br />
Her chiseled abdomen rapidly gained more definition. The grooves between her abs deepened, like jagged ravines. Two new blocks of dense muscle were created. Nikki cheered as she officially possessed an eight-pack now, looking down at her magnificent bricks. Their muscular detail was only matched by the equally defined obliques that sprouted along her sides.<br />
<br />
They led up to her burgeoning pectorals, which were slowly approaching the size of book covers! Both slabs of meat were thick, sturdy, and kept jutting outwards. Nikki&#39;s chest muscles were astounding. Nothing could keep them in check, and this became obvious when her sports bra started tearing slightly, as the fabric around her cleavage strained. It only got worse for the expensive garments when Nikki&#39;s healthy bust also expanded. Somehow, maybe as a side-effect, her breasts inflated ever so slightly. Nothing too extreme, but Justin knew she&#39;d shot up a cupsize or two in an effort to match the ripped pectorals underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh... This feels fucking amazing!&quot; Groaned Nikki, face pinched with concentration and pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Language, private.&quot; His mom remarked.<br />
<br />
Before the redhead could apologize, she was hit with another wave of growth. This time, the soldier&#39;s thighs bulged as her quadriceps and hamstrings grew. The already enlarged hamstrings were turned into sinewy ropes, striated and thick. They complimented her bulbous glutes, which could reveal their own striations with a mere flex. Nikki shivered as her shorts were stretched thin. The flexible, spandex-made clothing almost threatened to fall apart. It was just too difficult trying to cover up Nikki&#39;s enormous thighs. Due to her burgeoning vastus muscles, as well as the sheer size of her quads, tiny holes appeared all over her workout shorts. Bits of hardened flesh poked through.<br />
<br />
Nikki could probably feel the serum affecting her calves, too. The heart-shaped muscle didn&#39;t stop growing, becoming huge in the process. Like, a lot. Justin had never seen such calf muscles before. Runners and football players at school would often proudly reveal their toned lower halves, yet none could hold a candle to Nikki&#39;s calves. They were seemingly carved out of marble, jutting past her shins and visible even from the front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing.&quot; Gasped doctor Abrams, who was glued to her clipboard. She jotted down notes faster than a student trying to keep up with a caffeinated teacher during class. &quot;Her muscles are growing longer and faster than before. And that detail! The yellow serum is turning out to be far more effective, indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin silently agreed. If the blue serum could give a girl a physique that is decently strong and extremely toned, then the yellow serum would turn your average woman into a full-fledged bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
But what really threw astounded Justin were her insane arms. Nikki was buffing up considerably, as her forearms alone were more than twice as thick as his. The prominent veins on her arms had branched out, with smaller veins trying to reach her expanding muscles. Nikki moved her limbs out of reflex. As a result, her triceps flared out, separations and skin creasing when the massive horseshoe-shaped sinews tensed. And how could they miss her biceps being pumped up to Olympian levels? They were enormous mounds, having grown to the size of melons.<br />
<br />
Nikki threw her head back, crimson hair gliding over a strong back. &quot;Come on. Keep going! Gotta go for that last growth spurt!&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, the soldier&#39;s back had widened a lot during the transformation, made evident as her workout bra audibly groaned in protest. The straps looked dangerously flimsy around her massive shoulders. It was as if someone had inserted several pounds of muscle directly into her shoulders, giving Nikki deltoids that would turn any male bodybuilder green with envy, and just make her impressively broad. Numerous lined of separation dotted Nikki&#39;s delts. Even her neck was thicker! The muscle fibers that made up her neck had been enlarged by the yellow serum, and the private&#39;s meaty traps finished the muscular picture when they tried to reach her ears.<br />
<br />
The end of her growth was announced by Nikki herself, who growled loudly as she flexed all of her muscles at once. The huge, ripped chunks of beef were pumped and swollen. Had she gone for cheaper workout clothes, they would have totally been shredded to pieces by her immense physique.<br />
<br />
Luckily, no one would see Nikki indecent today. The shorts only came down to the edge of her bulbous glutes, and looked painted on her tree trunk thighs. Her workout bra was also in a tattered state, as the straps held on to her swollen traps for dear life, while her pectorals and breasts almost spilled out. Yet none of her private parts were revealed.<br />
<br />
Nikki panted as if exerted, but she wasn&#39;t sweating or anything. More likely the transformation process had simply been more intense than when consuming the blue serum.<br />
<br />
Justin felt his mom touching his shoulder, and the first thing he saw upon facing her was the proud smile plastered on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve outdone yourself again, sweetie. I&#39;m so proud of my little boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
His ears turned red with embarrassment. &quot;Thanks, mom. I&#39;m just glad it worked. It was difficult to predict how effective the formula would be, to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ve got your results right here!&quot; Nikki suddenly picked him up, enveloping the younger and much smaller boy in a tight hug. Her enormous muscles were hard and warm to the touch. She pun him around, and flexed her left arm. &quot;See this? I&#39;ve always wanted big guns like these. And looks like I have to thank you for helping me out, Justin. You&#39;re the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes immediately locked onto the frankly huge bicep that she summoned forth. He wouldn&#39;t say that it was impossible to get that big, but it was safe to say that only male bodybuilders, who either dedicated their lives to the craft or consumed a lot of steroids, could ever reach such size.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you drop him, you&#39;ll be cleaning latrines all day, private.&quot; Scolded Margaret. Her eyes narrowed. &quot;And you&#39;ll do so with your own toothbrush.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin stifled a laugh as Nikki froze, looking as if she&#39;d bit on a lemon. The strong woman gently put him down again. He was kind of disappointed, having grown a liking to Nikki and her amazing body, but his spirits were lifted when she subtly winked in his direction.<br />
<br />
And was it just him, or had she grown taller, too? Justin wasn&#39;t exactly tall nor short, but he only came up to her chest now. An awkward angle for sure. Nikki didn&#39;t seem to mind her increase in height, though. She would grow accustomed to being 6&#39;7 or just on 2 meters tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say that was a success.&quot; Abrams spoke up. She&#39;d apparently finished writing her personal notes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your thoughts, doctor?&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist tapped her chin. &quot;It&#39;s too soon to be sure, but from what Justin told me, this seems to confirm a theory of ours. All three serums work on the same base formula. What sets them apart, however, is their potency. I estimate that the blue serum equals roughly 25 percent of the growth formula&#39;s potential. The yellow serum on the other hand grants the consumer roughly 50 percent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the red serum?&quot; Asked Margaret.<br />
<br />
&quot;A 100 percent, if my calculations are correct.&quot; Abrams shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Of course, we don&#39;t know yet what this particular serum might do. Like I said, each colored serum unlocks a certain degree of the formula&#39;s potency. For all we know, the red variant could turn someone superhuman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;ll have to test it eventually. If nothing else but to gauge how efficient-- or dangerous --it is.&quot; Summarized Justin.<br />
<br />
He was rewarded with a smile from the scientist. &quot;Correct as always. The offer to be my assistant is still open, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll discuss that later.&quot; His mom interjected, like she usually did. &quot;For now, let&#39;s go grab something to eat.&quot;</p>
