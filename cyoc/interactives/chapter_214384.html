<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to krentol for this chapter</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geoffrey took a deep breath as he watched Veles read over the piece of parchment with Nicholas the skunk’s character sheet on it.  Or, at least, that was what Veles said was on the sheet.  To Geoffrey it just looked like a blank piece of paper.  Still, he saw Veles pull Nicholas’ essence out of the jar and stick it into that piece of parchment earlier, so Geoffrey just assumed that there was something about the process that he didn’t understand.<br />
<br />
“Hold still when I do this,” Veles said, “I think I have the hang of it but I’m not sure what will happen if you run off while I’m editing you.”<br />
<br />
“Just as long as I end up smarter,” Geoffrey replied as he lowered his head, “the other day I couldn’t figure out how much I needed to pay for my lunch.  You can’t imagine what it’s like to be stuck in a body like that.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” Veles replied as he began to wave his arms, “I’m just going to take a look at your backstory here and see what I can do…”<br />
<br />
“TRIM!”<br />
<br />
The words exploded through Geoffrey’s mind and he suddenly felt like his own body was nothing more than a costume that he was wearing.  While he could still see through the bear’s eyes, and feel through the bear’s skin, that outer shell of his being seemed so distant and unreal as a vast, black expanse stretched out in between the inner “him” and the outer layer of his body. <br />
<br />
As Geoffrey sat there dumbfounded, a character sheet appeared in the dark chasm between himself and the portal to the outside world provided by “his” eyes that sat off in the distance.  In top the left of the character sheet was a picture of a muscular white polar bear – a picture of him.  Geoffrey realized that it was his character sheet he was looking at, or rather, the character sheet that Finn must have made for him.<br />
<br />
“G… E… O… F…” Geoffrey tried reading some of the text on it, but with his low intelligence he was struggling just to make it through his own name.  It was a sad and humiliating reminder of the limitations of his body – even though he could quite literally see his entire existence written in front of him, he struggled to read the words that held the key to his own salvation.<br />
<br />
“Ok…” Veles voice echoed through the dark void that sat between Geoffrey and his body, “I think I can just swap a few words here and…”<br />
<br />
With a snap, Geoffrey felt himself suddenly expand into the empty space between himself and his body. Before he knew it, he was sitting in the camp, surrounded by his friends, with a very interested looking Veles staring at him.<br />
<br />
“So,” Veles said, “do you mryo guggint?”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey opened his mouth as he tried to ask Veles to repeat himself, but instead of words, all that came out of his throat was a rumbling growl.<br />
<br />
Confused, Geoffrey turned to Gregory, who just stared at him with a puzzled look.<br />
<br />
“GEOFFREY,” Gregory’s said as the word resonated in Geoffrey’s mind, “nior intio wer distee, tinor?”<br />
<br />
The strange noises coming out of Gregory’s mouth only added to Geoffrey’s confusion as he looked around at the shrinking members of his group.  Had Veles spell gone wrong?  <br />
<br />
Geoffrey felt a popping sensation in his hips, as shortening legs moved out towards the side of his body, forcing him to lean over and place his front paws on the ground for stability.<br />
<br />
As Geoffrey’s thumbs receded into his hands and his fingers grew shorter and blunter, he tried to think back to his time in the village.  No one in it was particularly smart, but some of them had known nature magic.  Veles magic was similar, maybe?  Maybe he could remember something to help him understand what Veles had done to make it so the rest of the party couldn’t speak anymore.<br />
<br />
Yes, that was it!  He remembered his old trainer, who could use nature magic to speak simple sentences to him.  <br />
<br />
“Stay calm Geoffrey,” his trainer had drilled into him, “you are a war bear, you are to protect your owner.  You must stay calm when everyone else is frightened so that you can stay alert for enemies.”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey felt the top of his skull recede back into his head as his body continued to bulk up with the heavy musculature of the smartest war bear that his trainer had ever produced.<br />
<br />
Gregory’s hands grabbed the sides of Geoffrey’s head, pulling at him until the massive bear was staring eye to eye with the much smaller mink.  His owner was yelling at him, but none of the words were the ones he had been trained to understand.  Geoffrey stuck out a thick tongue and licked the mink’s face, hoping to calm his owner down.<br />
<br />
Calm.  <br />
<br />
The rest of the party was in a panic.  Gregory yelled at Veles while pointing at Geoffrey.  Charlie held his hands out on front of himself in an attempt to diffuse the situation, but from the sound of his voice, it was clear that Charlie was just as scared as Gregory was.  <br />
<br />
A hissing voice rang out over the sound of lute-strings being plucked.  Geoffrey looked to the side to see the kobold that had recently joined their party begin to sing in a soothing tone, though her tail flicked back and forth in a clear tell that she, too, was frightened about whatever was going on.<br />
<br />
But the most scared of the group was Veles.  One of his hands was held up in front of Geoffrey, straining against an invisible force, almost as though he was trying to grip something, while his other hand was rapidly running over a parch of parchment that hovered in the air just in front of him.<br />
<br />
Calm.  <br />
<br />
Geoffrey knew that he had to stay calm.  He was Gregory’s war bear.  It was his job to protect Gregory from danger.  To protect Gregory, Geoffrey had to sit still, remain calm, and continue to scan the area for threats – something that was getting increasingly difficult to do over the yelling party members.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey was smart enough to know that their words held meaning, that they knew what the danger was and they were discussing it amongst themselves.  And for them to be as frightened as they were, it must be a truly terrible danger.  Which made it all the more frustrating for Geoffrey, who knew that with his powerful body he would able to dispatch whatever was frightening them – if only he could know what it was.<br />
<br />
“GEOFFREY!” Veles shouted as he clenched his hand, “YILL!”<br />
<br />
The world pulled away from Geoffrey as he felt himself sink into a black abyss inside of his own body.  He wanted to dig his claws into the ground, or even just to wiggle his tail, but it all felt so far away.<br />
<br />
*Pop*<br />
<br />
The world rebounded back onto him, and Geoffrey found himself sitting on his butt, his gaze fixed on the fox in front of it.<br />
<br />
The bear tried to turn its head to look at Gregory.  It began as the nerves in his brain sent a signal to his brainstem, ordering the muscles in its neck to move.  The electricity carrying that signal flowed down to the base of is his skull, passing out into a nerve bundle in his spinal cord.  But the closer the signal got to the muscles it was supposed to move, the more the signal began to disperse into a mass of inert goose feathers.  <br />
<br />
And it wasn’t just the electricity running through the bear’s nervous system, it was his entire nervous system itself.  All of the nerves, all of the muscles they controlled, the tendons that connected those muscles to his bones, even his bones themselves.  Everything in the bear’s body - every cell, every fiber, every protein was soon affected.  Every molecule, every atom inside of him began rearranging themselves, altering themselves away from the rich complexity that had given the bear life, and converting into soft, downy goose feathers.<br />
<br />
The bear just sat there, staring dumbly at Veles as its skin turned to fabric and its body filled with fluff.  <br />
<br />
The party was yelling again.  More words the bear couldn’t understand.  It felt something press into its side.  It wanted to turn to see what it was, but it couldn’t move its head.  It couldn’t move its body.  It couldn’t move anything at all.<br />
<br />
That slight force pressing into it was all it took for the bear to begin to tip over, but it still couldn’t move – it still couldn’t do anything to balance itself as its body toppled over onto its side, exposing its bottom for the world to see.<br />
<br />
The bear felt its cock growing harder, as the previously fleshy organ converted into a thick rubber dildo.  It was so hard, so erect.  There was a tightness in its balls as a magical enchantment caused them to overfill with lube.  It could feel that lube moving up through its sensitive dildo cock, before slowly leaking out of the tip.<br />
<br />
A cold breeze blew across the inside of its asshole as the flesh surrounding it likewise converted to firm rubber, causing it to develop a slight gape, before also developing a thin coating of glistening lube.<br />
<br />
The sex doll bear, enchanted with a self-lubricating dildo cock and rubber sleeve ass, laid on its side staring at the fox in front of it.  <br />
<br />
The bear just sat there, eye to eye with the the fox, whose own eyes were wide with panic - all while the sound of yelling filled the air. No doubt, they were arguing over who would get to use it first, and the fox was afraid that it wouldn’t be him.<br />
<br />
The sex doll remembered the first night after it was bought.  The petite mink had laid it down on a bed, then climbed on top of it.  The bear remembered the feeling of the mink pressing its tight asshole down onto the doll’s thick dildo cock.  It could feel the mink’s asshole stretching around it as the mink begin to gyrate up and down.<br />
<br />
The sex doll could imagine itself laid out over one of the nearby tables, the mink taking its dildo while one of the others fucked it in the ass.  The doll could imagine what it was like to have muscles, to be able to squeeze down with its own its ass, to feel a cock inside of it grow slick with the doll’s own lube.<br />
<br />
The fox shouted something and once again the world grew distant, only to rebound back on the doll.<br />
<br />
Its feather stuffing began to convert back into muscles and bones and new nerves grew back into an expanding skull as the bear felt its body come back to life.  Geoffrey blinked as his fingers slimmed out, his legs grew longer, and his body shrank down.  Flexing a still stiff hand, Geoffrey turned his head see to a very shocked mink standing just to his right.<br />
<br />
“My liege,” Geoffrey began, “is everything alright?”<br />
<br />
“Are you…” Gregory stutter, “still Geoffrey?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I am, my liege,” Geoffrey replied in a rather flat tone.<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry,” came Veles voice, “but I can’t fix this, not now anyways.”<br />
<br />
“Fix what you befuddling oaf!” Gregory yelled back.<br />
<br />
But Veles just sat there in silence as he stared at Geoffrey.<br />
<br />
“Geoffrey,” Gregory hesitantly asked, “how did you come into my service?”<br />
<br />
Geoffrey thought back to his first memories, of the toy maker that had proclaimed Geoffrey to be his finest work.  A self-lubricating sex doll, custom made for the prince of an important kingdom.  He remembered spending months on the prince’s bed, getting fucked every night before the prince would vanish to out the door during the day.<br />
<br />
Then the prince got another doll and grew bored of him.  He spent his days laying in a corner, forced to watch as the prince fucked a rather portly pig doll.  <br />
<br />
He remembered the court wizard standing in the room and pointing at him.  “Perhaps I can convert this into something more useful for you, Prince Louis.”<br />
<br />
A tingling had spread through his body as his stuffed body came to life.  The bear remembered its first sniff, as it took in all the scents that the palace had to offer.<br />
<br />
“Yes, this will make a fine war bear for you, once its properly trained.” The wizard had exclaimed as he put a hand on Geoffrey’s head.  Magic had run through the bear’s brain, instilling a sense of dull obedience into it.<br />
<br />
Then there were several hard months in the stables with the royal trainer.  He was taught to stay calm in the face of danger, to protect his owner, to lay down his life if need be.<br />
<br />
But training a war bear took a long time, and by the time it was done his owner had lost interest in him.  So he was given to the other prince, to Gregory.<br />
<br />
Gregory had wanted him for… other purposes.  Purposes that his feral body was no good for.  So Gregory had used his allowance to buy an uplift potion – something that Geoffrey was forever grateful for.  It was that potion that had let him walk on two legs, let him speak.  And, most importantly, it had been that potion that had let him serve his prince.<br />
<br />
His prince didn’t think he had need of a bodyguard, but Geoffrey took all of his duties seriously, even those the prince didn’t seem to care about.  At night, while the prince slept, Geoffrey would train with royal pugilist.  <br />
<br />
And the rest was history.</p>
