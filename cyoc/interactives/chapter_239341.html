<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they sleep, Alice and Jake&#39;s batteries start to drain, and they begin to feel their systems becoming less powerful. They wake up to the feeling of their limbs becoming less responsive and their movements more sluggish. *Hey, I think our batteries are running low,* Alice says over Mental Link. *Yeah, I can feel it too,* Jake replies, his voice equally soft, he tries to put his head on her plush chest, but he only succeeds on the second attempt. *Let me hear what your pump sounds like,* Jake asks her. *Are you trying to check my pulse or something? You know we don&#39;t have anything like that right now?* Jake laughs. *I know, I just want to hear the sound of your pump. Maybe I can hear if it&#39;s running low on power.* Alice giggles. *Okay, listen carefully.* She moves her front leg and Jake hears the sound of her pneumatic pump running. *Hmm, it sounds like it&#39;s running quite a bit slower than usual,* Jake says. *Yeah, I think you&#39;re right,* Alice replies. *I can feel my movements becoming more sluggish too.* They both try to move their limbs, but obviously their pumps can no longer generate enough pressure to move their limbs properly. *Hey, try to touch my nose with your paw,* Alice says. Jake tries to lift his paw, but it only moves a few inches before it stalls. *Ha! You can&#39;t even lift your paw!* Alice teases him. *Oh, shut up! You&#39;re not doing much better yourself!* Jake replies, laughing. *Don&#39;t you dare!* Alice laughs and tries to get up on her four legs, but she only manages to lift herself a few inches before she falls back down. *Haha, nice try!* Jake says, chuckling. *You&#39;re not exactly a spring chicken yourself!* Alice retorts, laughing. They both continue to lovingly mock each other, laughing at their situation and joking about how they have difficulty moving themselves or interacting with their surroundings properly. Not long after, they realize that their batteries are almost completely drained. *I think it&#39;s time for us to transform back into our human forms,* Alice says. *Yeah, I agree,* Jake replies. *I can&#39;t even raise my paw anymore. Would you want to go first or should I?* he asks her. Alice thinks for a moment. *I think you should do it first. You were the first transforming into a plush toy, so you should be the first transforming back.* Alice says. *That&#39;s a good point. OK, then I hope I still have enough energy in my battery to get far enough away from you. I don&#39;t know if and how the Transform-O-Matic would react if the beam hit us both.* He can&#39;t really move anymore, but manages to move his body by rocking and swaying to the side, away from Alice&#39;s unicorn body. *Well then, Transform-O-Matic: Transform me back into my human form and state.*<br />
<br />
The Transform-O-Matic&#39;s beam scans Jake&#39;s body and begins to transform him back into his human form. Alice watches as his body changes, his fur receding and his limbs lengthening. His face changes back into his human face, and his eyes blink open. He looks at Alice and smiles. &quot;Ah, that feels good to be back to normal and to be able to move properly again.&quot; If Alice could she would smile back at Jake. *I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back to normal. Now it&#39;s my turn.* She sends the command to the Transform-O-Matic to transform her back, but it looks like she is out of range of the transformation beam, because it appears roughly where Jake was just now and then switches off again. Jake looks at the laptop, a window opens and he reads out what is written there. &quot;It says here that you are out of range of the beam. You need to move closer to the Transform-O-Matic.&quot; Alice tries to move closer, but she can&#39;t. *I&#39;m out of power. I don&#39;t have enough energy to move.* She says over Mental Link. &quot;Oh, so your out of energy completely? Here, let me help you&quot; Jake picks Alice up and strokes her plush fur before putting her in the right place. Alice feels Jake&#39;s hands on her plush body, and she&#39;s grateful for his help. *Thank you, my dear. I appreciate it. But... this feels so nice. Would you stroke me a little more? Please?* She asks him, her voice soft and gentle. &quot;Oh, I&#39;d love to,&quot; Jake replies, smiling. He continues to stroke her plush fur, and Alice feels a sense of contentment wash over her. *Mmm, that feels so good. I&#39;m so glad I&#39;m with you.* She says, her voice filled with happiness. &quot;And I&#39;m happy to be with you. Are you ready to become yourself again now?&quot; Jake asks her lovingly. *Yes, I&#39;m ready. I&#39;m excited to be back in my human form and to be able to move and feel things properly again.* Alice says, her voice filled with anticipation. Jake smiles, puts her in place and then starts her retransformation on the laptop.<br />
<br />
The Transform-O-Matic&#39;s beam scans Alice&#39;s body and begins to transform her back into her human form. Jake watches as her body changes, her fur receding and her limbs lengthening. Her face changes back into her human face, and her eyes blink open. She looks at Jake and smiles. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right, it feels good to be me again. To be able to move properly again without the empty battery causing me problems.&quot; She stretches and yawns, feeling a bit disoriented but happy to be back in her human form. Jake smiles and hugs her. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back to normal. I was worried about you for a moment there.&quot; Alice hugs him back, feeling grateful for his help and support. &quot;I&#39;m glad you were there to help me. I don&#39;t know what I would have done if you weren&#39;t there.&quot; Jake smiles and kisses her. &quot;You&#39;ll never have to find out, because I&#39;ll always be here for you.&quot; They hug each other tightly, feeling happy and content to be back in their human forms and to be together. They sit down on the bed, holding each other and looking into each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;That was quite an adventure,&quot; Alice says, smiling. &quot;I know, right?&quot; Jake replies, laughing. &quot;I&#39;m glad we got to experience it together.&quot; Alice nods, feeling grateful for their relationship and for the Transform-O-Matic that allows them to have such unique and exciting experiences. &quot;Me too,&quot; she says. &quot;I love you.&quot; &quot;I love you too,&quot; Jake replies, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you enjoy the night? Do you feel well-rested? And do you remember dreams?&quot; he asks her. Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;I feel well-rested, but I don&#39;t really remember any dreams. I think I was too busy enjoying the experience of being a plush unicorn to dream about anything else.&quot; She smiles. &quot;And I loved the night. It was so much fun being a plush toy and cuddling with you as a teddy bear. I loved the feeling of your fur against my plush, and I loved the way you stroked my mane and tail.&quot; She giggles. &quot;I have to say, it was a bit weird not being able to move my limbs properly at the end, but it was also kind of nice to just relax and let you take care of me.&quot; She looks at Jake. &quot;How about you? Did you enjoy the night? Do you feel well-rested?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did enjoy the night. And I feel well-rested too. I think I had a few dreams, but they were all pretty vague. I remember something about being a teddy bear and running through a field, but that&#39;s about it.&quot; He smiles. &quot;I loved cuddling with you, you were so soft and cuddly, and I loved the way you nuzzled my fur.&quot; He chuckles. &quot;And I have to say, it was a bit funny watching you try to move around when your battery was running low.&quot; He laughs.<br />
<br />
Alice laughs too. &quot;I can imagine. I&#39;m sure I looked pretty silly trying to get up on my four legs and falling back down again.&quot; She smiles. &quot;But it was worth it, just to have you laughing.&quot; She leans in and kisses him. &quot;But I have to admit being in a genderless body was kind of interesting. I mean, I didn&#39;t have any kind of sex drive or anything like that. It was kind of nice to just be able to cuddle and snuggle without any kind of... distractions.&quot; She looks at Jake. &quot;But I probably feel a particularly deep need to feel you inside me right now. Does that sound strange? I mean, I was just a plush unicorn and now I&#39;m a woman again and I want to have sex with you.&quot; Jake grins broadly. &quot;Look, we&#39;ve had sex as objects so many times in one way or another. How about having sex as humans again for a change?&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;That sounds like a great idea. I love having sex with you, no matter what form we&#39;re in. But there&#39;s something special about being human, isn&#39;t there?&quot; She smiles and leans in to kiss him. Her hands reaching over his chest, feeling his warm skin and his beating heart. She loves the feeling of his body against hers, the way their skin touches and their hearts beat together. She feels a sense of intimacy and connection with him that she doesn&#39;t feel when they&#39;re in their object forms. She looks into his eyes, seeing the love and desire there, and she knows that she feels the same way. &quot;I love you,&quot; she says, her voice filled with deep emotions. &quot;I love you too,&quot; Jake replies. They kiss again, their lips touching softly, and then they begin to make love, their bodies moving together in a slow and gentle rhythm. As they make love, Alice feels a sense of joy and happiness that she&#39;s never felt before. She knows that she&#39;s found her perfect match in Jake, and that their love will last a lifetime. And as they come together, their bodies entwined and their hearts beating as one, Alice knows that she&#39;s exactly where she&#39;s meant to be. Jake&#39;s arms are wrapped around her, holding her close, and she feels safe and loved. She knows that she&#39;ll always be able to count on him, no matter what. And as they lie there, holding each other and basking in the glow of their love, Jake senses that Alice is feeling a deep sense of contentment and happiness. He smiles, knowing that he&#39;s the one who&#39;s made her feel this way. He holds her close, feeling her warmth and her love, and he knows that he&#39;ll always cherish and protect her. They lie there for a long time, enjoying each other&#39;s company and the warmth of their love. Finally, they drift off to sleep, their bodies entwined and their hearts full of joy and happiness.<br />
<br />
An hour later Jake wakes up to the sound of their radio alarm clock. Jake kisses her cheek. &quot;Wake up, my dear. It seems this is a sunny Sunday and maybe you want to get up and enjoy whatever this days brings.&quot; Alice opens her eyes and smiles at Jake. &quot;Good morning, my love. Yes, I&#39;d love to get up and enjoy the day. What did you have in mind?&quot; She stretches and yawns, feeling a bit sleepy but also excited for the day ahead. Jake gets out of bed and starts to get dressed. &quot;I was thinking we could go out for breakfast, and then maybe do some shopping or something. What do you think?&quot; Alice thinks for a moment. &quot;That sounds like a great idea. I could use some new clothes, and it would be nice to spend some time together.&quot; She gets out of bed and starts to get dressed, feeling happy and content. As they get ready to leave, Alice turns to Jake and says, &quot;You know, I think it&#39;s good to take a break from the transformations. We&#39;ve already planned a longer one next Saturday and we should be careful not to overdo it.&quot; Jake nods in agreement. &quot;Yes, I think you&#39;re right. It&#39;s good to take a break and just be ourselves for a while. We can always come back to the transformations later.&quot; Alice smiles, feeling grateful for Jake&#39;s understanding. &quot;I&#39;m glad we&#39;re on the same page. Let&#39;s go enjoy our day together.&quot; They leave the house, feeling happy and content, and ready to take on whatever the day may bring. As they walk, Alice turns to Jake and says, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking. Maybe we should start a journal or something to keep track of our transformations and our experiences. It could be fun to look back on and see how far we&#39;ve come.&quot; Jake thinks for a moment. &quot;That&#39;s a great idea. We could write down our thoughts and feelings, and even include some pictures or drawings.&quot; Alice smiles, feeling excited about the idea. &quot;That sounds like a great way to document our journey. Let&#39;s start it today.&quot; They continue walking, feeling happy and excited for their future together, and for the many adventures that await them.</p>
