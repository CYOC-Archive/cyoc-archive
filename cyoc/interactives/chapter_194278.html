<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan went to his room and started to play a game on his computer, homework could wait until later. He first needed to relax a bit, both from school and his sisters nonsense. Ten minutes into the game, he had to solve a riddle. Without much thought, Dan first started to nibble on the nails of his left hand in concentration. But within a minute of that, he switched to sucking on his thumb instead, which relaxed him far better. It took him another two minutes to finally solve the riddle, and only then noticed his wet thumb. “Weird. How did my thumb get wet?” he asked himself, not realizing he had sucked on it while solving the riddle in-game.<br />
<br />
It was one of the smaller changes Kat´s spell had made, adjusting his behavior slowly towards the wished result. Also, it was a needed trigger for the physical changes. Dan had, without noticing it, become a year younger already, making him fifteen again. His face looked younger, and a bit of his built up muscles shrunk away, but it wasn´t to noticeable to anyone, let alone Dan himself. <br />
The most telling part about the end result, however, was the change hidden from clear view, but noticeable if you looked for it. Dan´s green boxer shorts had turned into a big, puffy, white diaper underneath his jeans.<br />
<br />
Another couple of minutes later, Dan was already bored by his game. It was one of his favorites, but right now not what helped him relax like he wanted. When he stifled a yawn, he was quick to leave the game and his computer, instead laying down on his bed after kicking off his shoes. Within a minute, he was asleep.<br />
It didn´t take him long before he again was sucking on his thumb while sleeping. That, in turn, started to slowly regress him further. His muscles slowly shrunk, body hair all over his body receded back into his skin, and his body height also decreased by a few inches.<br />
But not only did he change slowly, but also his things did. First to change were his clothes, adjusting to his size, but also his age, targeting the end result. His plain, black t-shirt turned dark blue and gained a comic hero motive, who´s logo was also on the former simple black socks, now also dark blue. They also got napped soles. His brown jeans, still hiding the diaper underneath he knew nothing about, shrunk into shorts, before turning dark- blue as well. Afterwards, the merged with the shirt above, forming an onesie around Dan´s body, with only his hands bare and his feet in his socks. The white tennis-shoes he had dropped beside his bed by now had a green blinking sole, spotted the comic-hero´s logo on a dark blue background around the ankle part, and were now with Velcros instead of laces.<br />
<br />
The changes spread through his room slowly as well. His bed sheets, normally simply a light green, gained a cartoon motive fitting a toddler instead of a teen. One of Dan´s pillows, which he had his right arm dropped over, turned into a big plush tiger, easily half his size, and without waking up, Dan started to pull it nearer, hugging it with a relaxed sigh. <br />
While his bed itself remained unchanged for the moment, further things did change. His dark-brown carpet, which imitated wooden planks, got more childish looking, gaining various little animals and faces between it. The same applied for his white walls, also gaining little figures of animals dancing around.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, Dan looked like a ten-year-old, but as he had been a big kid, he was really only eight by now. <br />
Kat, wanting to know if her brother had already regressed some, was surprised how fast he was regressing instead. “Wow, Dan, you act more like a big baby then I thought. Looks like you will be finished around dinnertime already.”<br />
Dan, who had been slowly waking up by now, had heard his sister´s comment, and answered in a bit of a slur: “Don´t be mean to me, Kat. I´m not a baby.” Only then did Dan register how childish his voice sounded, so high-pitched. And since when did he say “mean” in the first place? He jolted up from his sleeping position, still clinging to his plush tiger like it was his life line. By now it was around three-fourths of Dan´s size. His eyes widened in shock as he saw his changed room.<br />
Gone was his computer, his desk was instead full of simple papers of pictures he could color. The desk itself was smaller and lower than before, the same as his chair. His bookshelf beside the desk was also smaller, and everything inside were childish picture books, his computer games gone as well. His tv system was now only a small tv itself, the rest of the equipment gone. Adding the childish walls and carpet, Dan´s room looked like a little boys one now.<br />
<br />
Dan started to cry in his shock, hiding his face in his plush without thinking. What had his sister done to his room? He hadn´t even realized his own changes beside his voice yet, but he would soon. Kat´s spell had only mage him unaware until he was younger than ten, and he had already passed that age. He just hadn´t looked sown at himself.<br />
Kat laughed evilly at her brothers misery. “Not much longer until you are just my little, diaper-filling baby-brother again, Danny.”<br />
Dan was intimidated by Kat´s laugh, and without a thought, started to wet his diaper. That, added to him clinging to his plush tiger and hiding his face, sped up his regression again.<br />
<br />
As Kat watched, Dan shrunk smaller again, being at least one head smaller than his plush within a few seconds. His clothes, already fitting a for a baby, shrunk with him mostly, but both his pant-legs and his sleeves got longer in relation to his body, slipping down his arms and legs. When his pant-legs reached his napped socks, they merged together. His sleeves soon swallowed his hands, before the end shrunk around Dan´s hands, forming something similar to mittens around them.<br />
The books in his shelf turned even more childish, and various things still unchanged around the room until now, turned into toys for small children, plush animals and blocks among other things.<br />
When the regression stopped, Dan maybe was three years old. And he noticed this by looking suddenly up his plush tiger he hadn´t even realized until than. Eyes large in horror, Dan now pushed the toy away and looked down, seeing his diminished form. As he now noticed his bulging lower clothes, he also realized his diaper, and wailed in even more horror when he noticed he had already wet himself like a baby.<br />
Said wailing, in turn, triggered the last regression step for Dan´s journey back into a baby as he regressed yet again. In not even another minute, Dan was reduced to an one-year-old toddler, still slowly regressing further. His onesie softened into a more plushy material then its former, cloth-like design. It would be more comfortable for a baby, but Dan didn´t even realized that in his loud wails.<br />
<br />
“You turn out cute, little baby Danny” Kat cooed at him, also mocking the teen trapped inside even more.<br />
“Tuwn me back” Dan screamed angry, but it sounded more as if he would soon throw a tantrum at his sister. It was worse when he realized how he sounded, taking much off his shout away. Kat even laughed again. Dan tried to look intimidating towards his sister, but a toddler wasn´t really that intimidating, let alone if he faced his own witch of a sister, who knew him good enough. In his position, standing on his bed, fists in his sides, he looked even more adorable to Kat.<br />
When his regression slowed to a stop around the time he was maybe a month or two old, Dan lost his balance together with the needed strength, making him drop back onto his diapered butt. A final “Nooo...” was wailed by him shortly before that, turning into “Ga go go go” around the time he had sat down, robbing him of his speech as well. <br />
<br />
Around him, his bed started to shrink, the last object that hadn´t really changed until now. Its mattress sunk more towards the ground, while the wooden frame started to raise, making Dan end up in a playpen with bedding inside. The frame had turned into bars, further trapping Dan.<br />
Kat laughed even more over her bawling baby brother, and so it took a bit of time before she could talk to him in any way. “No, Danny, I won´t. But if you listen, I will give you a choice how things can go for you next.”<br />
Another minute of bawling his eyes out followed, before baby Dan could calm enough to listen to his sister. He was still sniffing and shed tears in frustration about his situation, but he wasn´t as noisy as before.<br />
<br />
Kat waited a bit longer, and made sure she had Dan´s attention by clapping once before him when he looked around his room. Then she explained his options: “I guess mom won´t turn you back, as you weren´t really good these last few weeks, so I will give you the following options, Danny.” She clapped again when Dan looked away again, realizing her baby brother now had a rather short attention span. “First, you remain as you are now, a baby with the mind of a sixteen-year-old teen inside. As you have noticed, or maybe not, you have taken some babyish behaviors that you have to endure. That will also mean you need to be changed regular. Maybe a week like this will help you learn to be nicer to others.”<br />
Kat saw Dan´s attention was again wandering away while she spoke, but she only clapped before she started her second option to regain his attention. “Second, I will make you a baby even mentally, but let you keep some awareness of your situation. That could be easier for you, and not as boring, but also not as good of a learning experience, therefore you would remaining a baby longer, maybe two or three weeks.”<br />
Again, Kat had to clap to regain Dan´s attention. “That gets ridiculous, how will he decide when he doesn´t hear me out. Well, it isn´t my problem in the end.” she thought. Then she continued: “And third, I make you a complete baby without the old you inside, creating a whole new life for you, maybe, if mom agrees, with me as your mother. But realize that there will most likely be no return for the old you than. There are ways to protect the old you for eternity, outside your body, while you could do nothing and the new you lives its life instead of you. If sometime in the future we decide to turn you back then, you would still exist to return.” Kat clapped a final time. “What do you think you want of that, Danny?”<br />
Dan, for his part, hadn´t really heard the last part of each option, as his concentration and attention was limited as a baby. So, he had to decide if he remained as he was, would be semi-aware, or completely erased? The first two options would give him his life back later, he guessed, but it could be embarrassing for him. He was only sure he didn´t want to be erased completely, so the last option was out. <br />
<br />
Kat had to clap after a few minutes, already loosing her patience with Dan, who seemed to again be wandering with his thoughts. “Well, have you decided yet, baby brother?” <br />
Dan looked slightly frightened by her tone, but he had decided what he would take. And so, concentrating on his answer, he voiced another set of baby noises. Noting it didn´t work yet again, Dan switched to showing his answer with his fingers.</p>
