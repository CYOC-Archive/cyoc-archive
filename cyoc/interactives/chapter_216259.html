<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas looked through his closet and dresser to find clothes that would fit. He found a few stretchy muscles shirts, but no pants. Thomas stepped into the kitchen and stopped quietly. Thomas scanned the room to notice several changes, like the table being taller, the chairs being taller, his father now much taller and not wearing anything except an apron (that he could tell).<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad,&quot; Thomas began, &quot;I think I&#39;ll need to get some bigger pants and shirts for school tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s dad looked behind to his son, and asked &quot;Your mom got you those new sleeveless shirts last month, did you outgrow those already?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas shook his head no, &quot;Not yet, but I need school clothes too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom will be home soon, she can take you to swim practice tonight and to get a set of school clothes. Try to get a few sizes bigger to grow into,&quot; said Thomas&#39;s dad, his attention returned to his cooking. Thomas&#39;s dad handed him a bowl with a large eggplant with the top and stem cut off, covered in melted butter. Thomas&#39;s dad lamented, &quot;Sorry son, I have to go by the store tonight. I thought we had a few more. You can have all you want, but put them on the shopping list when we get low.  It wasn&#39;t too long ago when you could barely fit the smaller ones inside your anus. Don&#39;t take too long, the butter is getting cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas looked at the eggplant that was bigger than his fist at the widest part, but put the bowl on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too soggy? It&#39;s too soon for that.&quot; Thomas&#39;s father took the eggplant from the bowl and said, &quot;Lean over...if it&#39;s too soft I can fix it.&quot; Thomas complied as he leaned over the chair closest to him and he felt the cool butter then the tapered eggplant slide easily into his ass. Thomas&#39;s dad sighed in a relaxed way, &quot;Alright, clench tight and relax a little, then repeat. One might not be enough for orgasm...but you&#39;ll feel some arousal for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s father finished the evening meal cooking and was making three plates when orgasm overtook his son, now sitting at the table. There was a new sensation, a wet one, where his cock would have been. Thomas&#39;s father had just finished setting the table when his mom walked in, her business blazer and latex skirt made for quite a combination. Thomas&#39;s parents kissed briefly before she took off her blazer, revealing her ample cleavage contained in a latex sports bra, and sat down at the table. The three ate in silence, savoring the chicken-vegetable stir fry Thomas&#39;s dad spent the last thirty minutes preparing. Thomas&#39;s father looked up to his wife and said, &quot;Thomas needs some bigger school clothes. He&#39;s putting on the muscle now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s mom looked at her husband, and asked &quot;It&#39;s all those eggplants lubed with butter if you ask me. What is it up to, six a day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You told me that&#39;s what the strength and conditioning coach said. Besides, I&#39;ll go to the grocery if you can handle practice and clothes. Deal?,&quot; asked Thomas&#39;s dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Thomas&#39;s mom exhaled, as she finished her supper. She was as tall as his dad, and more muscular. Thomas listened as they went over the shopping list before Thomas&#39;s dad left and his mom went to change. The apron covered his dad, but he just left to go to the store wearing only an apron. Thomas grabbed a towel and his shoes, before waiting for his mom in the kitchen. Soon, she joined Thomas in the kitchen, wearing nothing. Her skin had a smooth shine, her features toned and ripped, and everything flawless. &quot;Okay kiddo, let&#39;s get you some school clothes and on to the pool for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The small department and athletic goods store near the fitness center was his mother&#39;s go-to place for clothes. Once inside she took him to the wrestling section, and found the biggest muscle shirt they had and handed it to Thomas to try on. Thomas had a difficult time with the shirt over his shoulders, and gave up handing it back to his mom. &quot;I am shocked you outgrew that already,&quot; Thomas mom exclaimed as she re-hung the large shirt. They went to the counter were an older man in a baggy wrestling singlet was making a new singlet according to some measurements he had taken previously. &quot;Hey, Sam....do you think you can fit my boy here with some room to grow?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your little one huh....I keep a few things that might work...&quot; the older guy disappeared in the back room. Soon he returned with a zip up top and an oversized jacket, handing them to Thomas one at a time to try on. The zip up top was very stretchy, and fit quite loose. The jacket was huge, but fit too snug in the shoulders. &quot;That&#39;s my biggest swimmer&#39;s jacket. I&#39;ll need to make a bigger one,&quot; the older man said. Thomas&#39;s mom nodded yes, and Sam took the measurements of the massive swimmer. &quot;Not too many seven foot plus customers. Give me a few days, I&#39;ll have to make a few things for the boy myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Sam,&quot; Thomas mom replied, giving the older man a passionate kiss that went for a couple of minute before the older man&#39;s body shook in orgasm, his hard cock clearly visible through the soaked outline of his loose singlet. Sam handed Thomas the zip up shirt and Thomas&#39;s mom led them back to the car and on to the pool. The unisex adult changing area was odd, but Thomas did not have to change. He went straight to the showers and then to the pool to log laps. Thomas did not see his mom for a couple of hours. The other three members of his relay team were already in the pool, naked. Thomas got into the shallow end of the pool when Mark, a football player from school swam up and pressed hard between Thomas&#39;s legs. Thomas let out a low moan from the same sharp press on his prostate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for practice Tom?&quot; asked Mark as he pressed again.....&quot;or do you need me to scratch that itch,&quot; Mark said softly as he pressed a few times. Mark turned Thomas around and buried his cock inside Thomas&#39;s ass, and he could barely feel it. &quot;Tom, you need to clench tight, your a bit full back here,&quot; asked Mark. Soon Thomas clenched his ass tightly and felt the veins and textured head of Mark&#39;s cock inside him. Mark did not last long, not even a minute, as he began to pump into Thomas&#39;s ass. Thomas felt the thrusting, but was far from any orgasm. Practice was a few laps of swimming before sucking or taking a cock into his ass. Thomas never brought his head above the surface of the water, chasing down his team members underwater as he milked their cocks until they could give no more.<br />
<br />
The three spent team members left after almost two hours, and Thomas&#39;s mom found him swimming back and forth the length of the pool without coming up for air. She splashed at the end by the ladder, which got Thomas&#39;s attention. Soon he had showered off the chlorine water from the pool and was on his way home when his mom asked the question, &quot;When is the next swim meet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to check with the coach,&quot; Thomas said.<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39;s mom smiled, and once back home, Thomas went to his room, and fell asleep quickly on top of his bed. Thomas&#39;s mom turned out the light and joined her husband for the night.</p>
