<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Angelo?  Ryan?  Vinnie?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Horst produced a cooler filled with at least two dozen cans of beer, and red plastic cups.  He handed Vinnie a foamy cup, and one to Carter too.  Then he poured one for himself.  Horst had laced both of the first two cups with roofies and Viagra.  He only put Viagra in his own cup.  He didn&#39;t want any trouble with Carter, depending on how things went with Vinnie and Ryan.<br />
<br />
Vinnie was a bit reluctant, but hey they were all men.  Three beers later, he was three sheets to the wind, and Carter and he were arm and shoulder singing in the tub.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boys, I&#39;ll go make sure the sauna is ready,&quot; said Horst getting out of the team&#39;s Jacuzzi. <br />
<br />
By the time he got back, Vinnie and Carter had climbed out, and were standing in the locker room with their wet jockstraps dripping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it would be great if Ryan could join us, Vinnie?&quot; said Carter in a slurred voice, as he and Vinnie held each other up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, um, yeah, s&#39;pose, more da merrier, right?&quot;  Vinnie said with a loud burp.   He put his thumb inside his jocktrap. He fumbled trying to get Ryan, off.  &quot;A lil&#39; help, Carter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yah, sure!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Ryan soon found himself in a twisted wad on the locker room floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now turn &#39;im back,&quot; said Carter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better straighten him out first, or he might end up mangled?&quot; Vinnie said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
Ryan was sitting on bench in front of the locker he lying out flat with ne&#39;ery a wrinkle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold me steady, Carter,&quot; Vinnie said with a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I-uh, &#39;scuse the boner,&quot;  Carter said as he held Vinnie up.  Both of them were sporting major boners.<br />
<br />
Vinnie extended his hands in Ryan&#39;s general direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Return to your own form!&quot; ordered Vinnie.<br />
<br />
The amulet glowed.<br />
<br />
Vinnie collapsed, and Carter sagged and went down together.  Two naked boys with rock hard erections, arm in arm, and snoring.<br />
<br />
Ryan gasped. He was flesh and bone, and soaking wet.  He hoped it was just Jacuzzi water, but he doubted it.  He stared at snoring Vinnie and Carter,  he made a fist.  Then he heard a sound behind him.<br />
<br />
He turned around.  The bank of lockers was gone.  A naked young man was coughing up a sock and jockstrap.  The locker room floor was covered with gear from the now missing lockers.  The dark haired young man stood up, and looked over at Ryan. Then he stretched his body as if he was stiff all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ryan, feels good to be human again, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; said the naked young man walking toward him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?  Where did the lockers go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course, I&#39;ve seen you every school day, and then some for the past 4 years, Ryan. We&#39;ve been intimate.  You fondled my balls and cock at least twice a day, and now you don&#39;t recognize me?&quot; said the naked man, &quot;You see I am Angelo Gucci,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait the 1980 quarterback who vanished?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Rafe, like your Vinnie had magical powers.  He turned me into the lockers, damn over 30 years ago. And my cock and balls were the lock and handle on the quarterback&#39;s locker.  Oh, and of course, lockers cannot cum. You edged me day after day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How was I to know?&quot; said Ryan standing up.  He was taller than Angelo.  The guy should be like 55 now or older, but he looks like he&#39;s 18. He is well muscled.  Ryan feels threatened.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s great, looks like Vinnie broke both our spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, not that he&#39;ll remember what happened, now will he?  Oh, right, you were on Vinnie, when Horst fixed those drinks for Vinnie and Carter, weren&#39;t you? They both were roofied.  I doubt they&#39;ll notice anything other than the missing lockers, but then again they&#39;re so drunk, they might not?&quot; he shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we get dressed.  I&#39;m sure my clothes are there, and I&#39;m sure we can find something that will fit you,&quot; Ryan said walking around Angelo to where his clothing lay in a heap.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Ryan, that&#39;s just what I was thinking, too,&quot; said he.  <br />
<br />
Ryan sighed in relief, his hunch was wrong.  Then he felt Angelo&#39;s hands on his shoulders.  Suddenly, he was spun around and eye-level with Angelo&#39;s erect cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-gug!&quot; gagged Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think, I&#39;ll wear this jock,&quot; said Angelo, as Ryan flailed helplessly.  His skin was pale, and ribs appeared on his skin.  He was shrinking.  He was turning back into a jockstrap.  It took maybe a minute or two. Angelo snapped his new waistband.   &quot;Yeah, perfect fit.  Sorry, Ryan, but Angelo hasn&#39;t existed for 38 years, and for all I know Rafe is still out there, and might come after me.  See he was 3 years behind me at school, so I observed some of his other tricks.  That&#39;s how I knew you&#39;d change back into a jockstrap, if I put you on. Just like if someone put clothes inside me, I&#39;d probably change back into a locker bank.  Now I cannot have that, and there&#39;s no telling that Vinnie wouldn&#39;t change me back.  I don&#39;t know what code witches and wizards live by.  Oh, and now for the truly neat trick, Ryan see us in the mirror?  Now watch, as I change into you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ryan looked up he saw Angelo&#39;s black hairy body get smoother, and he seemed to be getting taller, and his tanned skin paled.  Ryan saw his own image staring down at him, and grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan?  Ryan!&quot; shouted Horst as he re-entered the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horst!  It&#39;s great to be me again!&quot; said Angelo with Ryan&#39;s voice, as he turned around, &quot;How about a beer, and sauna?&quot; he suggested.<br />
<br />
Horst glanced at Carter and Vinnie embracing each other, as the drooled and snored on each other&#39;s chest.  Well, the roofies and Viagra had worked. He hadn&#39;t expected Ryan to be back, but hey. They still had a couple of toys to play with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Ryan, you wanna help me with those two?&quot;<br />
<br />
NO.  NO. Horst, it&#39;s Ryan!  I&#39;m still a jockstrap. That&#39;s not me!<br />
<br />
Angelo grinned, &quot;Ya know, I like the way you think, Horst.  Let&#39;s get Vinnie a replacement jockstrap.  I&#39;d prefer him not to put me back on.&quot;  Angelo reached down and took Standish&#39;s jockstrap off the floor.  It was still damp from being in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, and Angelo and Horst were bonding as Carter and Vinnie moaned and sweated in their jockstraps as they lay on the lower benches in the sauna, Angelo and Horst reclined on the upper benches, sipping their beers, and jerked off into their jockstraps. <br />
<br />
Ryan gagged, and glubbed.  Angelo patted his damp pouch.  Ryan was shocked to hear, &quot;There, there, Ryan, eat it all up,&quot; came Angelo&#39;s voice in his head- er, mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; gulped Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Ryan, I can hear you.  I need to know your mind, if I&#39;m going to be you.  Seriously, the first day you jacked off was 10-31-11?  So now it&#39;s your pin code.  Guess you were an early bloomer, or maybe it was the sugar rush? You ate a whole bag of Halloween candy in one sitting?  You know it should have been 11-01-11, it was after midnight,&quot; Angelo said with a mental shrug that Ryan could feel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah!&quot; sighed Angelo both mentally aloud, as he blew another load into Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glub, glub, mo, mot mo cum. You can hear mugh! Glub, glub....&quot;</p>
