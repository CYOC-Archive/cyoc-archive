<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Lisa drove to her date she gazed down at the ring. As crazy as it was she found it fasinating that it could do what it did. She wondered how long Katie had it in her possession andwhy she was so worried about anyone useing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can appreciate Katie beung cautious,&quot; she thought. &quot;But this isn&#39;t that hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she pulled up to a stop sign Lisa looked out at a group of kids in the park. The children all appeared around 11 or 12 and were enjoying a fun day in the park. Lisa smiled as she watched the kids laugh and play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember those days,&quot; she mused. &quot;Everything was always so easy. I miss things being so simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unknown to Lisa the ring took her thoughts as a wish. As the light changed Lisa drove on unaware she was slowly growing younger.<br />
<br />
Lisa was oblivious as she reentered her twenties. Her body toned as the small lines smoothed around her eyes. Lisa shifted slightly in her seat as her clothing shifted on her. &quot;Huh thats odd,&quot; a now 23 year old Lisa whispered. Hitting the turn signal Lisa drove onto a main road and merged with traffic. Lisa continued to drive as a confused look spread across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats up with this outfit,&quot; the 20 year old Lisa exclaimed. Lisa looked herself over curiously finding the waistband of her panta to be loose while her bra strap slid down her shoulder. Groaning in frustration she pulled onto a side street to take inventory of her clothes.<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned as she looked her clothes over. She was confident they fit properly when she left this morning but now she found them to be baggy and ill fitting. Shrugging she decided to check her appearance in the rear view mirror, promptly screaming in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit not again,&quot; the now 18 year old exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Lisa looked at the high school girl in the mirror. Her innocent face was framed by her fiery auburn hair that cascaded past her shoulders. As she continued to look at her reflection her eyes bulged in horror, she was still growing younger.<br />
<br />
Quickly a 16 year old Lisa scanned the area for a parking spot. Carefully she began to creep down the street towards a commuter lot. The task was proving to be difficult however as Lisa began to shrink as she got younger. Lisa now found herself scooting forward in her seat as she shrank a few inches. Lisa was begining to break into a sweat as she pulled into a parking spot. Looking in the mirror she winced, she was 14 now.<br />
<br />
Lisa gazed at her hands as she continued to grow younger. Horrified she watched as the cuffs of her shirt slowly rose up covering her hands partially. As Lisa looked over her body she groaned. Her once prominant breasts had been reduced to mere bumps that were growing smaller by the second. Frantically the 12 year old began to dig through her purse looking for her phone. She needed Katies help and she needed it now.<br />
<br />
As Lisa&#39;s regression completed itself making it 11 she discovered it. Letting out a childish yes in a tone that made her wince. Quickly she made the call hoping her niece would be able to help her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank god,&quot; Lisa said in relieve. &quot;Katie its Lisa im in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pause on the other line seemed to last forever as Lisa quickly looked over her surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa where are you,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Mom is going to be so mad at you. Me and Kellie are supposed to watch you and Gloria today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s jaw fell in utter disbelief. She had unintentionally altered reality. Now Katie, the only person who could help her, saw her as annoying kid sister. Tears began to well up in her eyes as she now tried to convince her niece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie,&quot; she cried, wiping her nose on her overly large sleeves. &quot;Please i need you to belief me. Its me Aunt Lisa, your mom. I turned into an 11 year old kid. I need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice joke Lisa,&quot; Katie huffed in typical teenage fashion. &quot;Seriously no more games. Where are you hiding. Mom already took the car and i am not getting grounded because you want to play hide and seek.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa began to sob as she looked down. Quickly she realized what a mistake this was as fresh tears fell from her eyes. She was so young now that her feet no longer reached the pedals. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; she wimpered. &quot;I wish you would remember.&quot; <br />
<br />
The ring understood the wish and began to glow. Lisa, still inconsolable, did not notice until Katie responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Whats wrong and why do you sound like a kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa wiped her eyes and almost jumped out of her seat. &quot;Katie,&quot; she screamed. &quot;Katie, you gotta help me. I dont know how but i&#39;m a kid again. Im not even tall enough to reach the pedals anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay stay calm,&quot; Katie said. &quot;First how did this happen. Second can you tell me where you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know how it happened,&quot; Lisa whined. &quot;One minute I was driving and the next minute poof I&#39;m 11.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think Lisa,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Did you think about something. Did you notice anything that made you even want to be young again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa tried to calm herself down as she thought carefully. Slowly she began to remember the kids at the park and how she thought about how simple things were qhen she was a kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may of seen a bunch of kids and thought about how simple things were when I was a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sigh on the other side of the line made Lisa wince. She could almost see Katie rolling her eyes as she looked at her phone. &quot;I told you to be careful with the ring Mom,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can ground me when i get home,&quot; Lisa yelled. &quot;Just get out here and help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa now scanned the area. She was i. A commuter lot by a set of offices. Lisa sighed as she noticed the lot was deserted, thankfully it was only crowded during the week.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in that commuter lot by the office building off of Exxess Road,&quot; Lisa said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I think I know where that is,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Let me see if Claudia can borrow the car and take me there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait&quot; Lisa exclaimed. &quot;Why do you need a ride. Can&#39;t you come by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You havent let me get my license yet and you have the car,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Maybe this will convince you to let me get both.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa frowned as she could almost visualize Katie smirking. &quot;Just get out here and hurry,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I&#39;ll be out their soon,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Just keep the doors locked and don&#39;t tall to anyone. &quot;<br />
<br />
As Lisa and Katie said goodbye Lisa sighed. She never realized just how much responsibility Katie had in keeping thw ring and not messing things up. Sighing the 11 year old kicked off her shoes amd socks and laid down across the front seat. Hopefully her niece would be there soon to rescue her.</p>
