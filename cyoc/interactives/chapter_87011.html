<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mina quietly made her way up to the home where hir sither lived with Maurice and their family. It was a quiet afternoon and shi had finished hir shift for the day and had decided to deal with some issues on hir mind. Charlie and Sally had brought in their grandchildren that were born to Snowflake and Janice, and Mina had been their to perform the checkup. Both infants were doing well and Mina breathed a great sigh of relief at that. It did, however, remind hir of the present issues that were on hir mind, and that brought hir to hir sither&#39;s home. <br />
<br />
Shi chuckled as shi prepared to knock, thinking of all the things that had led hir here. Shi had remembered seeing the reports on the Fee City outbreak with all the newly transformed Chakats so lust driven that they went after anyone to mate with, and doing so only spread the infection. Shi had seen the report on the Paris outbreak where the Kats began to become violent and had at times attacked French police and soldiers. Shi knew that hir daughter, Flake, had gotten caught up in the Paris outbreak and hir sither had been responsible for the Fee City outbreak, but at first the images of rape and lust were all that shi had of them. Then came the Houston outbreak, when shi met Sally for the first time and that lead to a family reunion, which led to hir finding that once that lust phase was burned through, or vaccinated, Kats could not only be friendly but in many ways they weren&#39;t too different from where they were as people.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then I became one too,&quot; Mina chuckled to herself and looking back hir taur body, &quot;after initially wanting to avoid it at all costs... I became one willingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi then knocked on the door and waited for a response. Eventually the Kat shi had come to see as a snow white Chakat opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Mina,&quot; Snowy gave a friendly smile, &quot;What brings you here, sith?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two gave a friendly hug before Mina answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to talk to you about something, can I come in?&quot; Mina asked, &quot;Or am I interrupting something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... no,&quot; Snowy answered, &quot;Maurice isn&#39;t home yet, Snowflake, Alpha and Centuri are working on their homework... Snowflake is helping hir sithers... I only came home to pick up Alpha and Centuri.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maurice is still at work?&quot; Mina wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re getting very close to finalizing refinements to the Retrovirus Vaccine,&quot; Snowy answered, &quot;we found the &quot;aging gene&quot; and that will allow us to turn anyone who was elderly when they became Kats to become human again if they wish to... They&#39;ll retain a Kat&#39;s aging...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And inspiration strikes,&quot; Mina chuckled, &quot;hopefully it works.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy nodded and lead Mina in. They walked into the house and passed the kitchen where Snowflake and hir sithers were at work. Alpha and Centuri were working with something related to the alphabet and Snowflake was working on math, though occasionally shi leaned over to either congratulate hir sithers or correct something. All three said hello as Mina came by, Snowflake asking if shi&#39;d missed an appointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Mina commented patted Snowflake&#39;s shoulder with her hand, &quot;I came to talk with your mother about something... Something private and personal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Alpha wondered innocently, &quot;Is it with grandpa&#39;s wedding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re gonna be flower gurls!&quot; Centuri added.<br />
<br />
Mina chuckled. Ronnie had told hir about Timothy&#39;s Chakat falling for the Tyrannosaur Dinokat, Casey Jones, and how shi and the others getting married were sent to visit Paris while Sally, Jess, and Janice were planning the wedding. Shi knew full well that hir niphews would be flower gurls in the triple wedding. She looked to them with their bright eyes and cute little muzzles holding very cheerful smile, and Mina felt hir heart flutter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the wedding,&quot; Mina answered, &quot;it&#39;s something that I wish to talk with your father about. Can you stay here with Snowflake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alpha and Centuri both nodded. With that, Mina then turned and walked through the open portal to the living room with Snowy following behind hir. Once in the room both Chakats sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what did you want to talk about, sith?&quot; Snowy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a wonderful family,&quot; Mina commented as shi looked back through the door to where Snowy&#39;s children resumed their school work.<br />
<br />
Snowy at first lowered one ear and tilted hir head in confusion. Shi knew shi had a wonderful family, a family that included Mina, hir sither by blood. After a moment shi remembered back to when Timothy first became a Komokat and was depressed over what shi had done. During that conversation Ronnie had mentioned that shi wanted to become a mother. As shi remembered this, hir eyes widened as shi realized what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you pregnant? Is Ronnie?&quot; Snowy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, neither of us are pregnant... yet,&quot; Mina answered, sounding somewhat uneasy, which shi couldn&#39;t hid from hir sither.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Snowy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s wrong... but...&quot; Mina said slowly, &quot;I mean... Ronnie wants to become pregnant... BADLY. We&#39;ve treated so many Kat pregnancies. We&#39;ve seen you and Maurice and practically every other Kat with their children. You all look happy when you&#39;re pregnant... I can see it in Maurice now... even after all the worries over Snowflake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a mother before, sith,&quot; Snowy reminded hir, &quot;You had Flake and raised hir, largely on your own. You&#39;d have Ronnie with you this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mina sighed and nodded, remembering back even farther. The one night stand that left hir pregnant and on hir own. Shi couldn&#39;t even remember Flake&#39;s father&#39;s name. Shi then raised Flake on hir own, and had seen Flake grow up, become a Kat, married hir old roommate and became a mother and father, hirself. It made hir proud at what shi had accomplished in terms of raising Flake, but at present things were different with Ronnie. Shi knew Ronnie, and shi loved him as any lover would. Ronnie would certainly help, but that didn&#39;t change the fact that shi was nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t really ready for Flake when I became pregnant with hir,&quot; Mina sighed, &quot;though obviously at the time I was still only a &quot;she&quot; then... and so I had to be ready. This time... this time is different. This time I can actually plan for it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s left you nervous at being a mom again?&quot; Snowy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;AND a dad,&quot; Mina answered, &quot;we both have both sets of equipment...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two paused to laugh for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to have babies with Ronnie... to feel my womb swell with hir soughters... to feel hir womb swell up with my soughters,&quot; Mina admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m nervous as to whether or not I&#39;ll be a good parent... a good father... I mean... what worked with Flake may not work with any child that Ronnie and I have... I mean... Flake was human when she was born... any Kat born to me and Ronnie may grow my sabers...&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy watched hir sither point to the two larger saber-like canines on hir upper jaw that were the hallmark of Smilodon, the basis for Mina&#39;s Kat form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any soughters you have won&#39;t be a threat, you know that,&quot; Snowy answered, &quot;even if they inherit your teeth. You have nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if something goes wrong?&quot; Mina asked, &quot;it&#39;d break Ronnie&#39;s hearts... I don&#39;t want to see hir hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing will go wrong, sith,&quot; Snowy hugged hir sither, &quot;you and Ronnie&#39;s hips are more than wide enough to give birth and you&#39;re both very healthy and you&#39;re both good people. Just do what you did with Flake and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; Mina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know so,&quot; Snowy answered, &quot;If you and Ronnie want to get pregnant... go and get pregnant. You&#39;ll both be wonderful parents together, and your family will always help you.&quot;</p>
