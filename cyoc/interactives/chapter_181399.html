<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lewis woke up sore. He had never quite had a workout like the one he had yesterday, and he felt it in every muscle this morning. He stretched out, the new shape of his body no longer seeming strange of foreign to him, time spent working out also seemed to make it feel more like his body. The only oddity was the feeling between his legs. He peered down, sheets resting a long a chest with a different topography, pectorals rather than breasts to the obvious tent that popped up further down his body.<br />
<br />
Morning wood. He reached down under the sheets and gripped his cock in his hands. Warm and hard, and no wonder with the dreams he had last night. Kendall sprawled out naked on his bed, that prize cock of his hard against his stomach as Lewis slowly thrust in between those smooth, muscular ass cheeks. Lewis moaned softly as he pushed the sheets aside, losing himself in the fantasy as jerked himself off. No wonder men always seemed to be thinking with their cocks, it was hard to ignore.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long. Either the memories of the dreams were too good, or Lewis was just too new to his cock, but with a deep moan he came, splattering strings of cum across his stomach and chest. He lay panting on the bed for a moment just staring up at the ceiling. What if someone had walked in on him? Then panic made his whole body heat. No one would recognize him. His parents, his brother. He would just be some strange guy in Lisa&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the closest thing to clean himself up, a sock, he did so and ran over to his bedroom door. He popped it open slightly and peered out. No sound, nothing to see. He slowly breathed a sigh of relief. Right, his parents usually had to get to work early, and Thursdays were swim practice for her brother so he would have been out early, too. Still, he quickly made his way to the hall bathroom he shared with his brother and slipped inside. He almost jumped at the reflection in the mirror. Lewis had been expecting to see his new face, but he had changed further. The skinny boy look was gone, he was still lean, but obviously well-muscled. Long red hair was still pulled back but now there was red scruff on his jaw to match. And a patch of red hair between his pectorals that topped a trail of red hair down to his cock.<br />
<br />
Yesterday he looked like a male version of Lisa, today he looked.. older. He looked more like a senior in college than in high school. He was, if he did say so himself, pretty damn hot though. Maybe it was just the hair and stubble making him look older, but he decided to leave it for now. He needed to come up with a plan. He got in the shower to lather up and rinse off. It took some willpower not to stroke himself off again, something that was helped just by exploring the planes and curves of his new body. Whatever was going on with most of the guys at school seemed to have caught him up, too. Maybe one of them could help.<br />
<br />
Lewis tried to think of who to go to, but only two names kept coming up, Kendall or Mr. Clark. Both of them were smart, and maybe had some idea of what was going on. Lewis stepped out of the shower and dried off, having to make another raid of his brother&#39;s room for clothes. Where they had been loose yesterday, they were tight this morning, too tight. Anything that did fit hugged his new muscles a little too tight and while he liked the way that looked he wanted to be inconspicuous this morning. His father wore larger sizes, so he made a trip there. He found a button-up shirt that wasn&#39;t too bad, though instead of stretching over the gut like it did on his father it just hugged his chest. A pair of slacks from his fathers slightly-less-girthy days were a bit loose but an old belt helped keep them cinched tight and held up. Luckily they had similar show sizes, too. With that, he headed off to the school, he was certain either of the two men would be there.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Kendall slept like the dead. After his jerk off session after school he went right to sleep. No studying, no cramming for the next exam, he didn&#39;t even have his evening text with Allison. He just drifted off to sleep half dressed with those grass-stained coveralls balled up next to his head.<br />
<br />
Speaking of his head his thoughts felt slow and sluggish, like they were coming through cotton. &quot;Just slept too long..&quot; He muttered to himself over a yawn. He stretched and rolled out of bed, scratching at his side as he wandered over to the bathroom. He stopped in front of the toilet to relieve himself, glad that no matter what was going on with him his prized asset remained unchanged. If anything, his new body and habit for keeping himself smooth just made his tool look all that more impressive. Allison certainly seemed to enjoy his new strength. Though thinking on his girlfriend caused a strange feeling inside him. It almost felt as if thinking of Allison was in someway.. inappropriate.<br />
<br />
He walked to the sink and washed his hands, then splashed some water over his face to wash the last of the sleep from his eyes. He looked in the mirror at the man looking back at him. And it was a man he realized with a bit of a start. Handsome, slightly rugged,  but no teenager, despite being smooth and clean shaven, even a Hollywood casting would have a hard time passing him off as a teen in a high school movie. He looked down for a moment. &quot;Unless maybe for a porno.&quot; He quipped to himself.<br />
<br />
Heading back to his bedroom he rolled his shoulders and his neck, stretching out muscles still stiff from too long in bed. Then he spotted his alarm clock, which he had never set. &quot;Shit..&quot; He was going to be late for school. But he felt torn. Going to school seemed at the same time both ridiculous and necessary. Why would he still be going to school? But then the student in him won and he quickly got dressed. He grabbed the first thing at hand, a pair of those overalls he bought at the mall the other day, tugging those right on sans underwear. He didn&#39;t even think it strange to go commando, it felt right to have the rough denim rubbing up against him. He pulled on a sleeveless black tank before pulling the shoulder straps up and shoving on some socks and a pair of heavy duty boots.<br />
<br />
He gabbed his keys and ran out of the house, leaving behind his backpack and his class materials without even thinking of them.</p>
