<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Kevin Sanders,&#39; I wrote into the journal. As the ink started to dry a bit of light beamed out of the page from each of the letters. &quot;Woah...&quot; I muttered as I looked at it. This definitely wasn&#39;t a normal journal. Or it had to be some kind of overly elaborate prank. Either way, I still wanted to write more. At least to test its validity a bit more. But it couldn&#39;t be something too big. Something that would be different, but not overly noticeable.<br />
<br />
Sitting in my dorm, I already knew what I wanted to change. There was always a mess. Josh, my roommate had a tough time respecting boundaries or understanding that the trash was supposed to go in the trash can. He&#39;d lay all kinds of junk food wrappers or trash around and pretend that it was mine. Sometimes even shoving it on my side, to pretend that I was the messy one. I did my best to ignore it, but problems still rose up between us. It was a long dream away from the sexy cowboy I was hoping I&#39;d get when I&#39;d heard he was going to be from Texas. At no point should I have just assumed he&#39;d be a tall, tanned, handsome guy who wore tight jeans and an even tighter t-shirt, with a ten gallon hat, but I also didn&#39;t expect the fat slob of a roommate either. <br />
<br />
I looked at the notebook again, &#39;Josh always picks up after himself, making sure his living areas are always clean. He&#39;s never felt a desire to leave trash around the room even when he was growing up.&#39; As I lifted my pen again, the letters shined brightly, then lost their shine. But looking back up at the room, it was clean. More than I could have hoped for. Everything on his side of the room was perfectly organized and any piece of trash was thrown away. There was even a vacuum cleaner at the foot of his bed. Any crumbs that might have laid on the floor, completely gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; I muttered as I looked around. Even his clothes were packed nicely into the closet and dresser. &quot;It really worked. But how much can it really do?&quot; So many thoughts swirled around in my head that it was near impossible to think of anything at all. I slapped my face. &quot;Calm down. Think. Just one thing at a time.&quot; Taking a few breaths, I was able to concentrate. &#39;Josh Stanlin will come into the room in 1 minute and look around, but he can&#39;t remember what he was looking for.&#39; I practically held my breath as I counted down the 60 seconds. Part of me still wondered if this would actually work, or if I just was dreaming. Either way, I was about to make my dream a reality.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Josh wandered in. &quot;Damn it,&quot; he cursed. &quot;What did I come in here for?&quot; Then looked at me. &quot;Sup?&quot; he nodded back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup,&quot; I nodded. &quot;What are you looking for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh let out an angry grunt. &quot;Can&#39;t fucking remember. It&#39;s like I knew I needed something, but now I can&#39;t remember what the fuck it was.&quot; <br />
<br />
A smile cracked on my face. He was too busy looking under the bed to notice. That&#39;s when I enacted part two. &#39;Josh Stanlin has a fairly stereotypical Texan personality. He&#39;s grown up having to work hard and his body shows it. Strong, lean muscles cover his entire body and a tan that covers his entire body from working outside all the time. At no point in his life has he ever felt uncomfortable changing in front of another person and even forgets to wear something about 1% of the time unless someone specifically reminds him he has to wear something.&#39; I then paused for a second, lifting my pen.<br />
<br />
My eyes darted over to Josh&#39;s body. Already I could see the fat on his disappearing. Every part of his body was tightening against his frame as strong muscles replaced the flabby fat. His biceps molded into a tight shape a little bit bigger than a baseball while his forearms naturally looked more muscular. Veins bulged out of his arms as the sleeves of his t-shirt drained away and the two small holes where his arms stuck out, drooped closer and closer to his waist. With his wide shoulders and wide lats, the strings of his sleeveless shirt barely covered anything up. Both his nipples on his firm pecs were clearly visible, along with the dusting of hair that covers his chest. <br />
<br />
However, I was more interested in that tight and firm ass that pointed up into the sky as he bent back down to look under his bed again. The jeans Josh was wearing almost vacuumed sealed to it, showing off both the definition and size of his ass. They sculpted perfectly around his bulbous bottom, making them almost look painted on. It was the same with his legs as they squeezed tightly against his muscular legs. But most surprising were the large cowboy boots he was wearing. The brown boots rose up along his calves and seemed to almost make a bit of a scrap if they walked on anything other than the carpet in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... Damn...&quot; Josh cursed. A bit of a southern drawl annunciated with his speech. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh--what are you looking for?&quot; I asked again. I could feel a lump in my throat as I continued to stare.<br />
<br />
Josh only seemed to smile as he stood back up. He suddenly looked so much taller. His wide shoulders and thin waist gave him an imposing build, but his handsome friendly features make him anything other than scary. &quot;Well... I damn well gone an&#39; forgot...&quot; He scratched at his reddish beard. <br />
<br />
I quickly got to work on part three. &#39;Josh is looking for his jock strap that he always wears while working out. It&#39;s sitting on top of his bed.&#39; The ink lit up and then went back to normal black. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it you&#39;re jock?&quot; I asked. &quot;I think it&#39;s on your bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
His face lit up at the suggestion. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be..!&quot; he went over and picked it up. &quot;How could I go an&#39; forget you?&quot; Then kicked off his boots revealing his sweaty white socks, and then dropped his pants and underwear around his ankles. I stared, mouth wide open as I saw his dick out in the wide open. More shocked at just how little shame or decency Josh held. Or maybe just how big it was. Josh just smiled as he pulled up the jock strap and then some shorts. &quot;C&#39;mon man. Don&#39;t go starin&#39; all the time,&quot; he smiled as he grabbed one of his cowboy hats and covered my eyes with it. &quot;You might go an&#39; make me all bashful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So-sorry,&quot; I managed to get out as I pulled the hat from my eyes.<br />
<br />
Josh just shook his head with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s alright man. Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Then grabbed his sneakers and headed outside.</p>
