<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"Holy shit!  You're-you're a dog" repeated Jeff's friend Tony as he, Jack and Eric shuffled uncertainly into the room.

"That's -woof- right I'm a dog.  I'm a great pyrenees, or becoming one"
"B-but how?" sputtered Eric.

In between an increasing number of involuntary barks and yips, Jeff laid out the background on the Chronivac 4.0.  He was so calm and enthusiastic that his friends relaxed a bit.  And the simple fact of his transformation was enough to dispel their skepticism.  By the end of his explanation, Jeff was looking more and more like a Great Pyrenees and not just Jeff with fur, a tail and a muzzle.  

He was shrinking down from his 160 pounds to just over half that and took up a position sitting on his haunches in the chair as standing upright became a bit uncomfortable.

"Well -woof- guys?  -Woof-  What do -woof- you think?"

"I'd rather be a cheetah" said Tony.
"No, shark" said Jack.
"Dinosaur!" declared Eric.

Jeff held up a paw in a gesture telling them to quiet.
"Woof!  Woof woof woof!" he said to them.  His friends glanced among themselves.  Jeff the Great Pyrenees tried to clear his throat.  "Woof woof woof!"  He was physically completely Great Pyrenees now and unable to speak.  With great reluctance, he hopped up on the desk and deftly pressed his paw to just a couple buttons then stood back.  He let out a mild yip as he started to change back into Jeff.  In a minute, he regained speech.

"You can't change into something that -woof- doesn't live around here or that would immediately have -woof- animal rescue league types shooting tranquilizer darts into you then shipping you off to a zoo.  We're going to spend the long weekend as animals.  As dogs, no one will pay attention to us and we can stay together as dogs."
His friends saw the wisdom of this and agreed to all become dogs.  Jeff was delighted and he started to explain to his friends how the machine worked.  By the time he was done, he was naked Jeff but his friends didn't find his nudity noteworthy as he taught them the workings of a machine that would transform their teenage boy bodies into canines.  They agreed that Jeff would again become a Great Pyrenees and would go last to transform the other three first.  

Tall, wispy thin Tony demanded to go first but was undecided about what to become.  He asked his buddies.  Jeff, Jack and Eric looked at each other and then announced in unison, "Greyhound!" then broke up in laughter.  "Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
"Look at you!  Demanded burly Eric.  "You're, what?  Five eleven, with a -snicker- 22 inch waist and you run the anchor leg of the four by 200 for varsity track.  Greyhound."
Tony sighed and nodded and stripped off his clothes.  In a minute, Jeff had programmed the machine and Tony felt a pleasant surge of electricity go through him.  He turned to Eric.
"My waist is -woof- 24!"  The others laughed.
"I am going to keep my brain, right?" he asked and Jeff nodded.
Tony sighed then kept up a running report of how he felt.  "Wow" Tony laughed.  "I can smell everything.  This is -woof-incredible.  I know what soaps and shampoos you guys used and, Jeff, you still smell of Great Pyrenees.  Wow, this fur is fantastic"  He reached for his ass.  "Oops.  Here comes -woof- my tail"  In short order a long tail emerged from the top of Tony's rear and started a happy whip of a wag back and forth that never stopped.  "I'm gonna -woof- be -woof- so fast!  Hehehe paws!"  He let out one scared yip at the sight of his penis shrinking and then attaching in a sheath to his abdomen below his navel and cast a desperate glance at Jeff.  Jeff assured him that that's what he was supposed to look like.  The rapid whipping wag of Tony's tail resumed.  A moment later, his mouth and nose extended forward into the extreme, pointed muzzle of a greyhound and moments later the change was complete.  A happy Tony jumped up on his friends, licked their faces and barked ecstatically, hurting whoever was behind him with force of his whipping tail.  Jack and Eric were a little reluctant at first.  After all, this was Tony they were petting.  It was Tony sniffing their crotches, but Tony was so happy about the whole situation that he carried them along with his glee.  
"See," said Jeff.  "See, Tony loves it."
Tony jumped up on the desk, scattering pencils and papers with his happily whipping tail.  
"Wait, let's see if he's really still Tony inside" said Jack.  He turned to Tony.  "What's the square root of 81 times 4 divided by 12?"  Tony immediately pawed the desk 3 times.  "Alright, how about a word one?  Which word is the opposite of excited?  One . . truculent, two . . friendly, three . . bellicose or four . . dejected?"  Tony immediately pawed the desk four times.  "So you're completely you in there?" asked Jack.  Greyhound Tony nodded his head vigorously.

Next was varsity football team defensive tackle Eric who chose to become a mastiff.  In short order, he was covered in almost the same tan colored fur as Tony, but he ended up the same height as Tony, he weighed three times as much.  Upon completing his transformation, he let out a great howl that worried Jeff, who looked out into the street to see if anyone had reacted.  He turned to find Eric and Tony sniffing each other's behinds and then play fighting.  In no time, 190 pound mastiff Eric wrestled 60 pound greyhound Tony to the carpet but let him up unharmed.

Then, distance runner Jack opted to become a border collie.  That was the kind of dog his family had once had, he told Jeff.  Finally, Jeff started his own transformation, set, like the others to last to midnight Monday, the very end of Memorial Day.  While only starting to cover with fur, he moved the computer to a hidden position atop a bookcase and behind some other books.  

He'd felt the amazing cascade of sensory inputs as a dog just a half hour before and the way his canine fascination with it almost overpowered his reasoning mind but he hadn't felt canine social feelings.  Great Pyrenees Jeff happily sniffed and rubbed against, play fought and drooled on his pals.  This was his pack and they would work together no matter what.  He charged out the room and led his pack to the door, the latch of which he'd superglued into an open position.  He jumped against it and it bounced back against the frame ending up a few inches ajar.  They all trotted outside.

Tony immediately sprinted ahead of all of them, running 50 yards ahead then 50 yards behind them while the other three pretty much stayed in formation behind Jeff's lead as he brought his pack to the park.</p>
