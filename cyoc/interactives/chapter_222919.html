<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was horny and sporting the biggest cock he had ever seen. He needed someway to release his sexual energy, and his hands alone were not gonna cut it. He thought back to the plump backend of Jason on the stairwell, with cheeks so big he could ran his entire face into them if he wanted. He wasn’t gay but he had no choice. He quickly jammed his stiff rod into his pants, obscenely bulging all the way to his right knee, and waddled out of his room. The hall was completely empty, though there was no doubt of hidden cameras snooping on him. He didn’t care, the only thing he could think about was his cock. He waddled to Jason’s door and knocked hastily. <br />
Jason opened the door with his hand holding up his jeans, looks like someone else was exploring their new body after dinner. “Hey e Mike… what’s up?” <br />
“Jason, uh, can we talk?”<br />
Mike tried not to stare as Jason opened the door and let him in. He could see Jason’s new hams poking out from the sides of his hips. He certainly outgrew the skin build from earlier, now he looks to have done nothing but leg day for years. His pants were undone and he was holding the front with his left hand. Mike walked into the room and felt Jason staring at his as well, especially at his new package. <br />
“I uh, was um, I couldn’t get any sleep.” Mike stalled, he didn’t know how to ask to fuck another guy, he never had the experience. <br />
“Yeah… same, uh.” Jason stammered, “How does yours…feel?” <br />
Mike was surprised, guess Jason also tested if his body still felt real. “Yeah, it’s uh, it feels the same. Just bigger. You?”<br />
“Yeah. Uh, just bigger.” <br />
Jason was eyeing Mikes cock outline hard. No subtlety whatsoever. Mike couldn’t take the delay any longer. <br />
“Mind if I opened up my pants?” Mike asked, “It’s a little tighter than I would like.” <br />
Then Mike released the front button and felt his whole dick press against the front. He bulged outward but was still secured inside his pant leg. Jason was mesmerized as he began to kneel in front of the python “I think your stuck, let me help.”<br />
Jason pulled the whole of Mike’s cock out of his pants, holding it with both hands before subconsciously placing his mouth on the end. Mike almost tried to stop him before he felt Jason’s tongue on the hole. He was certainly experienced. Mike rolled his head back in ecstasy before Jason took to filling his mouth with as much penis as he could fit. He made it at least four, maybe five inches before pulling back, a trail of saliva chaining from cock to mouth. Mike wasn’t satisfied and came here fore one thing. <br />
Mike grabbed Jason by the shoulders and pulled him upward. Closing the gap between them, Mike let his cock push upward into Jason’s body as his hand groped Jason’s ass. Light moans escaped Jason’s mouth as his bubble butt was being poked and prodded with Mike’s hands. He reached into the gap and massaged around the cheeks. It was the best ass he had ever felt up of his many girlfriends. <br />
Mike had enough playing around. He pulled Jason to the king sized bed and pushed him on. Jason immediately removed his pants and got on his knees, shaking his large ass and his inferior 6 inch dick flopping about. Mike couldn’t bother with a condom, nothing would fit. He climbed onto the bed and kissed Jason’s cheeks before grabbing his cock with one hand. Jason’s breathing quickened in anticipation. Finally, foreplay was done. Mike plunged his cock into Jason’s rear, diving at least three inches before reaching the opening of his anus. Jason yelped in surprise, but mike was in control now. His cock was fully erect and begging for a warm hole. Mike thrusted his cock into Jason as far as it would go, first pushing in 6 inches, then 9, and finally finished thrusting at the full 13. He began a rhythm of pulling out and pushing in, in and out, in and out, until he didn’t have to think anymore. Jason’s cheeks squeezed his monster cock perfectly and his anus was practically jerking him off with every movement. Jason was panting and moaning with every thrust, his body collapsing into the bed while his ass faced upward. Mike began thrusting harder, feeling a power he never felt before. A cacophony of moans and grunts could be heard easily from the next room over, coupled with the squeaking of the bed frame and mikes battering ram continued to destroy Jason’s insides. He felt like a god over this subservient twink. He grabbed Jason’s hair and pulled it in, needing some leverage as he continued to fuck Jason in ways he has never felt before. <br />
If they had been keeping track of time, they would both know it had been at least an hour before Mike began to feel his balls filling up. He felt the familiar rush of seed dragging through his cock, except over a longer surface area, of course. With one final thrust, Mike pulled Jason into him and they both screamed out a deep moan. Jason felt Mike’s cum fill him all the was from his ass to his abdomen. Mike released half a gallon into his pillowy fuck buddy before finally releasing his hold on Jason. His cock flopped out with a satisfying “pop” to end their evening. <br />
Mike collapsed from exhaustion into Jason’s bed, his cock flopped in front of him before shrinking into 6 inches, fully soft. Jason also collapsed, but leaned inward to lay cuddling next to Mike. His massive ass was leaking a slow stream of hot, white cum and sticking out far pst his waist. Mike, in his post-sex haze of ecstasy pulled Jason into his chest and fell asleep.</p>
