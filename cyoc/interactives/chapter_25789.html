<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dita went the rest of the day without seeing or talking to Heather, and was deeply bothered by what little Heather had said. Dita could count on one hand the number of times she'd really seen Heather upset, and only one of them didn't involve a boy. Whatever she'd seen in the movie had most certainly upset her, and Heather wasn't usually bothered by much. (Unless it was boys, Dita knew how flighty Heather's heart could be.)<br />
<br />
Dita arrived home at 3:15, and saw her mother was still at work, which wasn't a surprise. Her mom usually wouldn't be home until 7 or so. Dita, who was normally quite well behaved and respectful of her mother's privacy decided to take the opportunity to do a little investigation of her own. Heather had mentioned the title of the movie- 'Wolf Coven'. If Heather's mom had a copy, it was a safe bet that Dita's mom had a copy as well, since they'd both starred in it.<br />
<br />
So Dita headed to the DVD rack in the living room, searching for &quot;Wolf Coven&quot;. Her mother was anal-retentive about keeping the movies alphabetized, so it only took her a minute or two to find no such title on the rack. <br />
<br />
Frustrated, but undaunted, Dita went to her mom's room. She was rather shocked, as the room was in a bit of disarray, with the bed unmade and a pile of clothing rather jumbled on the floor. That wasn't really like her mom at all. (Granted, Mom probably wouldn't have expected Dita to waltz into her room while she was away, but that was beside the point.)<br />
<br />
Deciding to be nice, she picked the pile of clothes up off the floor and threw them into her mom's hamper, and then set about making the bed. Then she began to notice several things that were amiss. Firstly would be the &quot;Wolf Coven&quot; Dvd, sitting in a jewel case on the edge of the bed. Second would be the dildo still laying out, partially covered by the bedspread. Third would be the slashes in the sheets, as though cut by a knife or...claws???<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...mom must've REALLY gotten freaky in her old age,&quot; Dita muttered to herself. For the most part, this didn't really bother Dita. She knew she had no right to be offended by evidence of her mother's sexuality; it's not like she found a dildo on the couch. Her mother had always been quite open with Dita about her sexual nature. Dita had known for years (though she'd kept it a secret, even from Heather) that her mom was bisexual, and been lovers with Debra for years.<br />
<br />
As Dita made the bed, she stared at the tears, and her mind kept telling her they looked like claw marks. &quot;Gosh..Heather's really gotten into my head this time, with all her talk of werewolves,&quot; she muttered. She finished making the bed, and picked &quot;Wolf Coven&quot; up. It was in a jewel case; it never had been on the DVD rack. Why had her mother never put this one with the others? What was so special about it? And more importantly, why had Heather been so upset by it? The more she thought about it, the more questions she had. There was only one way to find out, Dita knew, and that was to watch the movie. There was something more than met the eye.<br />
<br />
Dita pressed PLAY on the DVD player.  For a few moments the screen was a grainy black then lightened to show an eerie greenish lighting.  The camera shook several times, bringing to Dita’s mind the Blair Witch Project.  Dita heard low conversations in the background, and turned up the volume as much as possible.  She could still catch some fragments:<br />
<br />
“…daughter’s only thirteen”<br />
“-set to the coven, I hope”<br />
“-less us, oh Luna”<br />
<br />
The group had reached a clearing.  Dita recognized the area, it was a section of forested farmland east of town.  The camera wobbled, and straightened up, obviously placed on a tripod.  The camera blurred, and then refocused.  Dita’s eyes narrowed as she recognized Katie’s mother, Sharon, in a white cowlless robe surrounded by 5 black robed figures and another figure in red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the initiate ready to receive the final blessing from this Coven?&quot;   Dita frowned at her mom’s voice, uncharacteristically theatrical, almost British in intonation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This initiate is ready.&quot;  Sharon let the white robe fall off.  “Damn, nice body,” said Dita, squeezing her own legs together tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fellow coven members, the initiate is prepared; she knows what it is to be one of us and to become one of us. Let anyone with an objection voice it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
With no objections, the initiation continued.  &quot;Let Luna witness this new member of our family and coven, and let Luna grant her blessings upon her. Let Luna fill her with the power that Luna has granted us! Fellow coven members, cast off your robes and gaze to the sky, and cast off your human form as well!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” laughed Dita.  Yep, Heather was right, her mother, Dita’s mother, Katie’s mother all and four other family friends stood bare-assed naked gazing at the sky.<br />
<br />
Dita’s eyes widened as a tremor passed through the coven.  Six gasped, falling to the ground.  Dita watched in astonishment as their bodies changed.  “Holy SHIT,” Dita exclaimed as her mother sprouted claws, fur, and fangs along with the others, soon joined by Sharon who appeared to be changing much more slowly.”<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT,” said Dita slowly as the movie concluded.  She swallowed hard, her hands were trembling, her pants moist.<br />
<br />
After replaying the movie start to finish a second and third time, Dita fast forwarded to the transformations, then reversed, then fast forwarded.  Then she went through the transformations step by step.  “How the HELL did they do that,” Dita asked herself.  Everyone on the video was in fair to excellent financial health, as far as she knew, but there was no way they could put together a transformation effect like that with what appears to be a microbudget film.<br />
<br />
“All right then.  There must be a recent development in movie making that allows those effects at minimal cost.” Even as that thought arrived she rejected it.  Why not use the technology for the entire film?  Still, that was the only conclusion that made any sense at all; either her mom and her friends had gotten their hands on some highly advanced special effects, or they really were werewolves.<br />
<br />
“Hee hee hee hee hee..riiiight”  Of course that would explain the reason for a quickly imposed sleepover .  Crap.  She looked at the alarm clock on the nightstand.  Four-thirty, there was plenty of time for a more complete investigation.  “Sorry, Mom,” she whispered quietly as she turned on her mother’s computer.  She searched the files under “werewolf” with no result.  “Wolf” showed nothing, nor did “lycanthropy” or “transformation”.  TF brought up what was apparently the whole hard drive.  Scrolling down, she saw a single folder “TF”.  “Hello there,” she said.  She opened the folder to find nine additional folders:  “BMD”,”BP”,”HP”, “SD”, “ME”, “DITA”,”ST”, “EJ”, and “AG”.    Dita immediately went to “her” folder, and found it empty.  She then went to “AG” and found a handful of AVI files.  She clicked on AG1.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God,” Dita whispered.  It was Anaya naked on the floor of their basement, moaning and gasping.  A familiar popping and grinding sound soon joined the moans as the transformation began.  Dita slipped her hand between her legs.<br />
<br />
Almost two hours later, Dita finished another video.  She was very warm herself, not believing what she saw but more aroused than she had ever been.  Dita came to the conclusion that HP must be for Heather Peters.  Was that the reason for the meeting, to invite them to do transformation videos?  Her mother would be home soon.  Dita created an email with attachments for herself.  With that done, she cleaned up her mom’s room and went back to do some homework.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lisa arrived home later that evening a little after eight carrying an order of beef chow mien, fried rice, egg rolls and noodles.  Dita greeted her mother with an affectionate hug, but said very little to her other than the usual kitchen banter.  “Wait till tomorrow evening,” Heather had said.  Very well, thought Dita, I can do that.  Dita did not sleep well that night.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“74% – WHAT HAPPENED!?!” was scribbled on the economics test that greeted Heather that morning.  At least she passed, Heather thought to herself.  She had gotten a few curious glances that morning for wearing the school skirt since as a senior she didn’t have to wear the uniform, but until she got some looser slacks it would have to do.   She needed to speak with Ms. McDonald post haste.<br />
<br />
“Heather, what’s on your mind,” asked Brenda.  “Ms. McDonald, this is kind of embarrassing.  I was hoping I could be excused from gym for the rest of the year; maybe have a private study hall instead?”<br />
<br />
Brenda responded with a mock heart attack.  “Wot?  You don’t LIKE my class anymore, why do you want to drop from it?”  Heather shrugged, “let’s just say that I’ve found out some things regarding you, my mom, Lisa Singer, and a few others.  I don’t believe it, but my body’s been affected.”<br />
<br />
Ms. McDonald nodded, understanding.  “I’ll assign you to study hall for the next three weeks, but you still need the P.E. credit to graduate.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” said Heather.  At least now she wouldn’t freak people out in the shower by showing how her body changed overnight.  “Tell me, if you don’t mind me asking, does Rachel know?”<br />
<br />
Brenda closed the door to her office.  “Heather, I want you to promise me that you will tell neither Rachel nor any other person about the existence of lycanthropes.  Lisa, like most Alphas for that matter, is very strict when it comes to protecting our secret.  We do cooperate with the FBI, with M.I.5, with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other such organizations for our own protection, but we do our best to keep the general public unaware.  If there is a slip up…well…we have taken an oath that our secret becomes their secret.  Do you understand?<br />
<br />
Heather nodded.  “You’ll bite them.”<br />
<br />
“Possibly…but there are ways which are preferable, I don’t want it forced on Rachel.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dita arrived at school feeling groggy and uncharacteristically irritable.  She looked forward to the sleepover that night, and whatever Big Huge Announcement that would accompany it.  By the time the last bell rang, Dita was struggling to hold up her head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“So you’ll be busy tonight,” asked Mike.  “How would a movie and dinner sound tomorrow night?”<br />
<br />
Heather beamed.  “Yeah, that sounds like fun.  I’ll call you tonight, and let you know for sure.  Is your game being broadcast tonight?”<br />
<br />
He shook his head.  “Tomorrow afternoon, on tape delay.  I’ll talk you through it tomorrow if you’d like.”  “Sounds like fun,” said Heather.<br />
<br />
“Bye”<br />
<br />
“Bye”<br />
<br />
“Bye…”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lisa greeted Wendy an hour before opening.  “Hi honey!  Sorry we couldn’t finish yesterday.”  Wendy had thought that Lisa might be in early and to her delight she was.<br />
<br />
“No problem Lisa, I had a report to file with the Agency.  I just told them that your movements were pretty well normal.  Nothing suspicious here at all,” said Wendy.<br />
<br />
The two walked up to Lisa’s office, sitting down on the sofa.  Lisa took Wendy’s hand, squeezing gently.  “Wendy, I know that there is a good possibility you may already be a werewolf, but in the interest of full disclosure, I want to be sure you know what you’re getting involved in because there is no going back, no cure other than the grave.  We are NOT truly human beings, not anymore.  The wolf is always there, you understand.  You can change anytime you wish after that first full moon, but you will become a wolf every full moon whether you want to or not.  Once you receive the gift, it is yours till the day you die.”<br />
<br />
Wendy nodded.  She had expected this.  “Lisa…I want this.  I want you.”<br />
<br />
“Wendy, take off you clothes.”<br />
<br />
The two women stood up, disrobing.  Nude, they kissed deeply; caressing each others warm skin, then slowly sank into the sofa. Wendy pressed her small B-cup breasts against Lisa’s large bosom.  Lisa retuned the embrace, stroking Wendy’s breasts.  “These,” said Lisa teasingly, “are going to get a lot larger.”   Wendy felt herself grow even more moist at the thought.  She thrust up her pelvis to receive Lisa.  Lisa looked down at her friend.  “Last chance to change you mind,” she warned.  “Make me yours,” answered Wendy.  <br />
<br />
Lisa’s densely haired labia met Wendy’s bare lips, tickling her clitoris.  Wendy whimpered as she felt Lisa’s juices slowly trickle down, absorbed into her vagina.  The two girls moaned as the warmth and pleasure increased.  Lisa felt her body start to change.<br />
<br />
The sensation of Lisa’s body pulsating and popping sent them both over the edge, Lisa’s juices flowing into Wendy.  The two women lay gasping, Wendy covered in sweat, Lisa in fiery fur.  Lisa smiled, baring sharp fangs, and kissed Wendy on the cheek.  “You’re a werewolf, Wendy.”  As they embraced, Wendy noticed Lisa’s tail emerge from her lower spine, and began wagging excitedly.<br />
<br />
“What have I DONE,” Wendy couldn’t stop from asking herself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That evening, Heather and Debra arrived at Lisa's house.  Lisa greeted them at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in girls!&quot;  She stroked Heather's silky hair.  &quot;We have a lot to discuss.&quot;</p>
