<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason&#39;s parents hadn&#39;t beaten him, but he told people they had. They hadn&#39;t molested him, but he&#39;d told people they had. They weren&#39;t drug users, criminals or bad people at all, but Jason claimed they were. If people believed Jason was running away from a bad situation, they were more likely to give him a ride and money, so he kept piling on the bullshit.<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Jason called out to the van that dropped him off on the side of the crossroads. The van drove off, the driver giving Jason a friendly wave. Jason waved back, his hand contorting into a middle finger once they were out of sight. &quot;I told ya my mom fucked me and you only give me a ride? Fuck you!&quot;<br />
Jason had been left outside of a town he couldn&#39;t name, not sure which state he wasn&#39;t. He didn&#39;t care though, if Jason was here it meant he wasn&#39;t at home, listening to his parents or teachers bitch. All he had to him right now was his backpack, a change of clothes and whatever cash he could scrounge up on his way to New York. Once he got there...well Jason figured he&#39;d decide on his future after that.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Jason had chosen to run away because his parents kept bossing him around and his teachers were failing him just because he didn&#39;t do their stupid busy work. All he could see in front of him was freedom, what he failed to see was just how much walking he would do.<br />
Now Jason trudged down the two lane road, fields of grass on both sides. Occasionally a car zipped past and Jason held up his thumb. None of them stopped though. His legs ached, his throat ached and the sky was starting to get cloudy. Jason kept marching on, until a fat raindrop landed in front of him.<br />
&quot;Oh...shit..&quot; Jason looked up, &quot;Don&#39;t fucking rain, don&#39;t you fucking-&quot; Another drop landed between his eyes. <br />
Jason took off running as the rain began to come down. Thick heavy sheets, quickly soaking the teen to the bone. There were trees around, but most were small or provided little protection. Jason had to shield his eyes due to how heavy the rain was coming down. Off in the distance, between the walls of water, he could see a building.<br />
&quot;Oh thank God.&quot; Jason ran faster, each step splashing water. The building was a house, behind it were other buildings including a big red barn with an open door. A farm, a massive farm, perfect. There was a wooden fence surrounding the farm, Jason practically leapt it in a single bound.<br />
&quot;Fuck fuck fucking fuck rain fuck rain!&quot; Jason growled, making a beeline for the barn. Why the barn door was open he didn&#39;t know or care, but was open and he was using it. Now mud splattered all over as Jason ran, coating his legs in spots of brown. He wiped water out of his eyes  with every step, until he finally crossed into the building. He stumbled to a stop, breathing heavily.<br />
&quot;Fucking fuck rain!&quot; Jason gasped. He removed his shirt and twisted it, squeezing out the water, before peeling off his shoes and socks. Rain dribbled off of him, soaking the wooden floor. Jason tried to dry himself as best he could, but only managed to spread the water all over. He sighed. &quot;Well, at least I&#39;ve got a roof for tonight...they aren&#39;t coming out in this storm.<br />
Looking around, Jason found himself in a mostly empty barn. Against both sides of the barn were metal...cages? Frames? They reminded Jason of a voting booth, made up only of metal poles. Two long feeding troughs ran in front of the metal contraptions, both of them empty. The floor was packed earth, bone dry and very cold.<br />
Aside from the feeding troughs, in the back of the barn were several machines that Jason couldn&#39;t figure out what they did. Metal cylindrical devices with tubes coming out of them. Jason scratched his head.<br />
&quot;Is this some kinda sex thing?&quot; He asked. &quot;Fuck me, am I on a sex farm? I&#39;m gonna end up like the fucking gimp...&quot; Jason walked over to the machines, still dribbling water. He picked up one of the long tubes, with split into four tubes at the end. &quot;...Is this a milking machine? Might be...&quot; He grinned, &quot;Bet I&#39;d have a mindbending orgasm....Like a blowjob...&quot; Jason began licking his lips, &quot;Give &#39;em some sweet cream...&quot; Jason bent over the machine looking around the back of it for a way to turn it on. On the floor behind it he found a folded white note. Jason picked it up.<br />
Unfolding it, Jason didn&#39;t see the instructions for the machine. Instead he saw one sentence, printed in the middle of the page.<br />
&quot;The cows have a bull&quot; Jason frowned. &quot;The hell does that mean?&quot; He looked to the other side. Previously it had been blank, now their was another sentence printed. &quot;Show them you...are a bull? What does-&quot; The word caught in Jason&#39;s throat. He coughed to clear it, but that made the problem worse.<br />
Now Jason could feel an itch halfway down his throat. He clenched his jaw shut, breathing actually made the itch worse. Not only that, Jason began to feel nauseated. He rubbed and rubbed at the itch, but it just kept getting worse. And now Jason&#39;s jaw struggled to keep shut. He could feel a vibration there, driving him crazy, trying to get out. Jason clenched his eyes, it got worse. He shook his head and stomped his feet, even worse. Jason&#39;s muscles ached and his eyes burned. And he felt his jaw giveaway, unable to stop it.<br />
&quot;Mmmmmmmmmmmoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!&quot;</p>
