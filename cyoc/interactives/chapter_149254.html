<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sara sat in silence and examined the container before her. Deep blue with gold trimmings along the edges and a blue gemstone set in the center of the lid. The gemstone was circular with a black circle centered inside, giving it the imitation of an eye. Sara tried to open the lid but it held firm. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Frieda shrugged, &quot;all we were told was to give it to you when you were old enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara picked up the box and turned it over in her hands trying to find a latch or keyhole or some hint of how to open it, but found none. Her eyes finally settled on the gemstone on the lid and let out a sigh. Then she frowned thinking she saw the black spot in the center move and leaned in closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it,&quot; Jacob asked before throwing his hands up to shield his face when Sara suddenly threw the box out of fright. The box landed with a thud as it bounced off his arms and landed on the table right side up. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-it blinked,&quot; Sara yelled her voice stuttered.<br />
<br />
They looked down at the box, the designs surrounding the gemstone were opening and closing like an eye as it looked at each of them in turn before settling on Sara. A light shone out of the eye and illuminated Sara&#39;s face for a few seconds before it then looked straight at the ceiling. Inside the light a figure was appearing, its features becoming more defined before finally resolving into a womanly shape. <br />
<br />
Eventually the features focused and Sara stared at a small woman covered by a traveling cloak with the hood pulled back. As she&#39;d grown older Sara had noticed how different she looked to Jacob and Frieda, outside the obvious. The woman projected before her bore similar facial features that Sara saw in the mirror; a small nose, higher cheeks and a narrower head compared to either of her adoptive parents. She did note however the distinct lack of demonic features on her though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sara,&quot; the woman began her voice high pitched but distorted slightly, possibly from the way this was projected. &quot;If you are seeing this message, then we are either dead or worse. If all has gone as planned then you are safe and that is all that matters to us. Oh I wish me and your father could have been there to raise you, but it was important to hide you from the others. There is so much I want to tell you, so much I wish I could have done for you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We should probably fill her in on the big issue right now and not worry about what could have been,&quot; a light hearted voice interjected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes. You&#39;re right Jonn,&quot; the woman exhaled and then began again. &quot;For starters the world is at risk of being thrown into chaos if someone doesn&#39;t act. We have delayed them long enough, but there is no telling how deep the League has gone. I&#39;d give you names, but they were meticulous on keeping the identities of the high ranking members secret. Be mindful of who you trust, they could be anywhere. Inside this box is our last gift to you, may it help keep you safe,&quot; she paused for a moment before she continued, a tear rolling down her cheek. Another figure entered the projection, a man with sharp facial features and a good head taller than Sara&#39;s birth mother, and pulled her closely to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its okay, Zanna, let&#39;s try to finish this,&quot; he turned to face Sara and spoke confidently to her. &quot;There is so much we want to talk to you about, but time is short. Inside is a ring. Never put it on unless it is absolutely necessary. It will increase all of your abilities dramatically, however you will come away changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one last thing to discuss,&quot; Zanna glanced into Jonn&#39;s eyes before looking back at Sara. &quot;If you should see us again, you must not trust us. Kill us if the opportunity comes. The League has ways of...changing people, we will erase all knowledge of your location from our minds after we leave you for your protection. We love you Sara. Be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The projection faded out and they heard a lock click open and the lid lifted up revealing a copper ring sitting in the box. Sara wiped something off her cheek and found moisture. She stared at it intently, her mind swirling with questions. Blinking back tears, she reached out to the metal band and held it in the palm of her hand. The metal was polished to a shine and along the band was a series of dark smooth stones the size of pebbles spaced evenly apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda strange for copper of all things to make a ring out of,&quot; Jacob spoke up, &quot;looks too big anyw- never mind,&quot; he corrected himself as they watched the band shrunk in Sara&#39;s hand to a more fitting size.<br />
<br />
Holding the band in one hand, Sara reached into the box and retrieved a folded piece of paper. Opening it up Sara read aloud:<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;I hope it was worth what it took to get this ring. From what my scholarly friend has been able to uncover about it the ring, for lack of a better definition, purges the humanity from their very being. In other words, if a half-elf were to put on the ring it would eliminate all traces of their human ancestry. Whether this is meant to be its primary purpose or a byproduct I cannot say, but it also shows a slight increase in the physical and magical abilities of the wearer that persist even after the ring has been removed. A few subjects have shown some mental instability with either having difficulty coming to terms with their new state or showing drastic changes in personality. I have yet to find a reason why this was created and shall continue my research. Perhaps you will find a use for this trinket where I have no need of it. -M.&#39; &quot;<br />
<br />
Frieda stared at the ring like it was a venomous snake, &quot;what would possess Zanna to give such an item to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From her message it sounds like she was asking you to stop this League whatever it is,&quot; Jacob frowned. &quot;But this sounds like something beyond just you can handle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She never suggested I go alone,  I have my friends I can ask for help. What am I saying, this is more than just fighting some monsters,&quot; Sara slumped in her chair, &quot;I don&#39;t even know where to begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sara...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is something that more experienced people should handle. Not someone who still gets their tail shut in a doorway. Why is she dumping this on me? My only connection to my birth parents and it&#39;s a bloody quest,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot make this decision for you,&quot; Frieda began, you have your own life to live. Turn this in to a higher authority you can trust and wash your hands clean of it. Let someone else do this task.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara looked at her adoptive mother in utter shock. &quot;How can you say that?! I can&#39;t just shirk this responsibility!&quot; Sara got up and started pacing back and forth. &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to tell me it should be me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it yourself this should be given to more experienced people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if they fail? What if they aren&#39;t good enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that was their failure, not yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be encouraging me here? Saying something like; &#39;she wouldn&#39;t push this on you unless there was no other way&#39; or &#39;the whole kingdom is at stake and it&#39;s relying on you.&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say you aren&#39;t ready for this, then you aren&#39;t. The only way to be absolutely certain everything was done to succeed in this task is for you to take part in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I can&#39;t do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;ll know you did everything in your power and won&#39;t live a life wondering if you could have made a difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara turned and stared out the window intently, her back to her parents. The sky was starting to turn red as the sunset and a few lagging birds retreated to their nests. In the windows of nearby buildings residents began to light candles and lanterns. In the back alley a mother ushered her 2 sons into the house for supper. &#39;The whole world is in danger,&#39; Sara repeated her mother&#39;s message in her head. She caught herself looking in at an open window as a family welcomed their father home.<br />
<br />
&quot;The courier service doesn&#39;t arrive for 2 more days correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, why? You sending the message off to someone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I need to ask someone I know to send me the information on the attack at the capital and the werewolf attack at the camp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So does this mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to start somewhere if I&#39;m going to begin this quest,&quot; Sara smiled. &#39;So much for a vacation.&#39;</p>
