<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While “Amy” is distracted, Sarah, who herself is still nude, takes her phone and without the little “girl” noticing, opens the App and calls up Jeff’s/”Amy’s” file.<br />
<br />
Sarah then starts to type, being a person who doesn’t take a “no” for an answer, wants to prevent that from happening by having “Amy” accept the gifts she’ll be giving her, ‘besides, she did say that she’d like to own some designer clothes and that she’d like a new phone,’ the girl thinks to herself, ‘I’ll be happy to help her out, that way I will also be able to show her how thankful I am, that she made this day so much better.’<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amy” suddenly feels a little light headed, but the sensation quickly subsides and the “girl” just shrugs.<br />
<br />
Sarah looks at “Amy” out of the corner of her eye, ‘I hope it worked,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I know that she is not the real “Amy”, that “she” is actually a boy… John… but… he’s a girl… he’s Amy at this point. So, it makes sense to buy her girl clothes, besides, he would not need to buy girl clothes when… if… he, at some point, transform into Amy or any other 14-year-old girl.’<br />
<br />
“Amy” already is trying on the next outfit, ‘this is actually starting to make fun, trying on different types of clothing, combining them,’ she thinks to herself, ‘now I understand why girls love playing dress-up or have some sort of modelling show.’<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles when she notices “Amy” having fun trying on all of the clothes, “I see you are having fun, Amy,” she says.<br />
<br />
“I actually am,” the little “girl” says, “I never thought that it would be so much fun. I never gave it really a thought, you know, combining… experimenting with different clothing, kind of designing outfits in a way.”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “I’m happy that you are having fun,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Amy”, who is now wearing a blue skinny jeans and a white t-shirt with a unicorn on the front, looks up at Sarah, “and I am happy, that you are happy,” she says, smiling, “but, why haven’t you tried some clothes on?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I kind of didn’t think about it to be honest,” she says, “but I should get some clothes on… I AM starting to get a little cold,” she adds with a chuckle, grabbing a jeans and t-shirt herself, after pulling up some panties and putting on a bra. Once Sarah is changed she looks at “Amy”, “by the way, Amy,” she says, “remember when you said: “what’s the point if I am unable to afford any of the clothes”?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “I do,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Well, I… I’d like to buy you some outfits, and not only that, but I’d also like to pay for a new phone,” Sarah says.<br />
<br />
“Amy’s” eyes widen, “wh-why… why would you want to do that?”<br />
<br />
“Because… because I want to thank you for making my day be so joyful. If it weren’t for you, Jeff, I’d be mad at everything and everyone, but because of you transforming into Amy, just to make me feel better, really means a lot to me and I am sorry that I have always been mean to and that I have misjudged you,” Sarah says, “so, it really would mean a lot if you… would accept my gifts of gratitude.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” is overwhelmed, “I… I don’t know what to say,” she says, staring at all the designer and high class clothes, all of which could be hers! But the “girl” is aware that it would be wrong, “look, Sarah,” she then says, “I know you mean well, but… I am not a girl and these are girl clothes. What… what would I do with so many girl clothes?”<br />
<br />
Sarah chuckles, “well, for one: you are a girl at the moment,” she says, “also, I doubt that this will be the last time you’ll transform into a girl.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” thinks about what Sarah said, she looks down at herself, then at her reflection, then at the clothes and back at her reflection. The little “girl”, ‘I must admit,’ she thinks to herself, ‘being a girl IS kind of cool. Sarah has a point, I doubt this will be the last time I’ll transform into a girl, and if I accept her gifts, then I wouldn’t need to buy any female clothes myself!’<br />
<br />
“So, Amy,” Sarah asks, “will you accept?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks up at Sarah, the little “girl” then smiles and nods her head, “I accept your gifts,” she says, “you know, being a girl is kind of amazing, don’t get me wrong! I do miss my dick and being a boy, but being a girl is really cool. I love just how this body feels and moves!”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “I thought so,” she says, “I am pleased that you have accepted my offers. Now, choose anything you want and I’ll buy them for you, the price doesn’t matter!”<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks down at the huge pile of clothes, the little “girl” rubs the back of her neck, “I think… I need a second wardrobe, because… I’d like ALL of the clothes.”<br />
<br />
Sarah raises an eyebrow, “seriously,” she asks, “even the… you know “sexy” ones?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “yeah, I don’t know why, I just love them,” she says.<br />
<br />
Sarah chuckles, “hehe… you are acting kind of more like a girl than a boy,” she says jokingly.<br />
<br />
“Amy” looks up at Sarah, “how come? I don’t feel any different than before.”<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “don’t worry your cute little head about it,” she says, ‘looks like his mind is a little muddled. Probably from him adding the “fashion knowledge” and me causing him to accept my gifts, BUT she does not need to know about that. It’s actually hilarious and fun watching a straight boy acting like a true girl,’ she thinks to herself. Sarah then says, “if you want to keep that outfit on, give me the tags, so that I can pay.”<br />
<br />
The little “girl” nods, “I actually think I will,” she says, “I do feel less exposed with these jeans and t-shirt,” she adds, tearing the tags off of the clothes and handing them to the tall girl.<br />
<br />
Sarah smiles, “you look really good in the outfit, Amy,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Amy” smiles, “thanks,” she says, looking at her reflection, “I too think I look really cute in it,” she adds with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“You really are a cute and good looking girl,” Sarah says as she grabs all the clothes, “I’m not surprised that so many boys can’t take their eyes off of you.”<br />
<br />
“Amy” nods, “I’ve noticed,” she says, “but thankfully, due to my mind being that of a straight boy, I don’t really feel attracted towards males. I’d really hate it if I’d end up landing in bed with a boy!”<br />
<br />
“Would it really be that bad,” Sarah says, “I mean… you are a girl, and girls have boyfriends. Besides, it’s not gay if you have sex as a girl, I mean… aren’t you at all curious?”<br />
<br />
“Amy” blushes a little as she follows Sarah to the counter to pay, “not really,” she says, “though… I honestly don’t know… a part of me is curious, the other part is more disgusted at the thought of sharing a bed with a boy.”<br />
<br />
“I guess you’ll have to see where your feelings guide you,” Sarah says, “I just want to let you know and warn you about a boy. His name is “Riley”, he’s 15 and he is obsessed with Amy, the real Amy does not want anything to do with him. He is honestly a worse creep and perv than Dean.”<br />
<br />
“Damn, thanks for telling me,” the little “girl” says, “could you tell me how he looks like, so that I’ll be able to stay away from him.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, he is half a head taller than you… I mean Amy… he has turquoise eyes, which look somewhat mystic and magical, almost hypnotic. He also has a natural olive skin tone and has the average athletic body of any 15-year-old,” Sarah then smiles, she then hands “Amy” the bags with all of the clothes, “don’t wory to much though, I doubt you’ll ever meet him. Now, let’s get you your new phone,” she then says before heading towards the exit.<br />
<br />
“Amy” groans as she heaves the bags full of clothes, “he does sound handsome, though,” she says, “I thought… I thought Amy is attracted to that kind of boy.”<br />
<br />
“She is,” Sarah says, “but as I said earlier: Riley is a pervy-creep!”<br />
<br />
“How so,” the little “girl” asks, “I mean… I just can’t believe that there is anyone out there who is a much bigger creep and perv than Dean.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Riley is at least double that worse,” the pink haired girl says, “when he wants something he tends to try and get it, no matter how. He stalks Amy regularly, calls or sends her texts daily, which caused Amy to get a new number. He sees anything he loves as HIS, he is really dangerous, almost like a sick psycho!”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” “Amy” says, “okay… that really does sound scary.”<br />
<br />
Sarah nods, “now, enough about him,” she says, “let’s get you your new phone.”<br />
<br />
“Just, please, don’t make me get something girly,” the little “girl” says.<br />
<br />
Sarah chuckles, “no worries, you simply pick the phone that you like the most.”<br />
<br />
As they continue on to the phone-store, neither of them notice that they are being watched, “I must say, Amy looks really gorgeous today,” Riley mumbles to himself, a grin on his face, “today is the day I’ll get what is rightfully mine! Hehe… and with this Chronivac-App, nothing will stand in my way!”</p>
