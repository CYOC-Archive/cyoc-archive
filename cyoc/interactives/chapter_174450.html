<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the dizziness passed, Jeff opened his eyes.  The fact he had eyes at all told him that he was currently not his own vagina.  Looking down between his legs, sure enough, there&#39;s his vagina.  He reached down and felt it.  And it felt... well, certainly not normal.  After all, he didn&#39;t even have a vagina until a little while ago.  But beyond that, it didn&#39;t feel any different than it did minutes ago.  And yet he was certain that within his recently-obtained female sex, was a copy of his conciousness.  Which means, he himself had become the host.<br />
<br />
By all accounts, he should&#39;ve been disappointed.  He had wanted to become his own vagina, but from his perspective, he didn&#39;t get to.  And yet, he was okay with this.  Somehow, he found himself no longer interested in being a vagina.  It was as though all interest had been drained from him.  In fact, he found it strange that he wanted to be a vagina in the first place.  All the more strange that he now had someone living as HIS vagina, especially a copy of himself!<br />
<br />
Jeff now wondered if it was even worth becoming female.  After all, becoming his own vagina was the entire point of becoming female in the first place.  He briefly considered changing himself back to male, but decided against it.  Strange or not, the person in his vagina did want to be a vagina.  He wasn&#39;t sure if his vagina was enjoying himself, but either way, it was only temporary.  As soon as his conciousnesses are merged back together, he&#39;ll know whether this was an enjoyable experience or not.  For better or worse.<br />
<br />
For now, though, Jeff returned to the Chronivac&#39;s settings.  If he ever wanted to do another transformation like this one, he wanted to know more about its failsafes.  If he had made himself unaware that his vagina was a person, what would happen if he then tried sending another copy of his conciousness to his unknowingly occupied vagina?<br />
<br />
Returning to the &quot;Other Person&#39;s Anatomy&quot; options, he once again tried setting himself to become his own vagina.  He no longer liked the idea of it, but as long as he didn&#39;t confirm it, there&#39;d be no issue.  As soon as he selected his vagina, though, another message popped up.  &quot;Failsafe: Currently selected anatomy is already occupied by another conciousness.  Transformation into currently selected anatomy cannot be performed while occupied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, good to know.  Not only does that confirm that a copy of his conciousness is housed inside his vagina, it also means he could&#39;ve set his host self to &quot;Unaware&quot; without worry.  Useful information should he ever choose to do something like this, again.  Although, what if he had been unaware, and tried to become part of someone else?  Upon choosing to become a vagina belonging to a random person, yet another message popped up.  &quot;Failsafe: Target is currently host to one or more other conciousnesses.  To allow continued hosting and prevent possible harm to other conciousnesses, target&#39;s conciousness will be duplicated between current body and selected anatomy.&quot;<br />
<br />
So it would be just like Jeff&#39;s current situation, except his copy would be in someone else&#39;s body instead of his own.  He assumes that if he wasn&#39;t currently playing host to himself, he&#39;d be wholly sent to another person&#39;s anatomy.<br />
<br />
Well, now that he understands the Chronivac&#39;s failsafes... now what?  For the next 24 hours, he is playing host to a sentient vagina.  In the meantime, he could play around with the Chronivac some more.  He may no longer be interested in being a vagina, but there&#39;s plenty of other options.<br />
<br />
Jeff got up from his computer to stretch and think, walking around the room.  It felt strange having a vagina between his legs instead of a penis.  But it probably felt even more strange to be the vagina itself.<br />
<br />
He eyed the clothes he had discarded before his initial transformation into a female.  Picking up his underwear, he found that it had been altered with the rest of his surroundings, now being a pair of female panties.  He pulled them on, finding it fascinating how they felt on his female crotch.<br />
<br />
Then, as Jeff reached for his jeans, he noticed an additional item of clothing laying there, one which he most definitely did not have before becoming female: a bra.  He lifted it up.  Holding the bra against his chest, he looked towards his mirror, at his female body.  The bra was clearly intended for his C-cup breasts.  But he had no idea how to put it on.  And as Jeff looked around his feminized room, he head a dreadful realization.  While a copy of his conciousness was now living the simple life of a vagina, he himself was stranded in a female version of his own life!</p>
