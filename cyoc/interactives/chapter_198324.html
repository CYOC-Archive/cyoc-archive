<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Tina was messing with the watch dials, she was facing towards the gym floor where she could see everyone working out. In her main view was a tan female woman in her early 20s. You could tell she had some money to her as all her green zip pullover and white running shorts were name brand. She was relatively fit for being tall with a skinner frame. Her blonde hair was tied back in a ponytail to keep from getting in her face as she ran. She was pretty sweaty and breathing hard so you could tell she’s been at it for a while. <br />
<br />
Tina continues to focus on the watch and ends up moving the dials to the cloning feature. She clicked the button on the watch trying to make the watch work but it wouldn’t budge. Weirdly, she felt something happened when she pressed the button but continued to look over the watch without touching it more. After letting out a sigh of exhaustion, Tina looks up from the watch where she gets a look of confusion on her face. In front of her is Brett running on the treadmill where the woman was just running.<br />
<br />
Tina was baffled as to how she missed the woman get off or why Brett was now on the machine. He was still dressed in his gym uniform polo and khakis while running. “He Brett, your going to get in trouble if Arles sees you running or a sweaty uniform.” Exclaims Tina Brett on the treadmill continues running with headphones in and didn’t hear Tina. “What are you talking about? I’m not sweaty?” Said a voice behind Tina.<br />
<br />
Tina quickly pivoted and saw Brett starting back at her from behind the desk. Tina looked back at the Brett on the treadmill. Tina double takes a few times before addressing Brett.<br />
<br />
“What is happening?!” Said Tina manically. “What are you talking about?” Brett replied. “You’re starting to freak me out. Did you work too hard vacuuming earlier?” <br />
<br />
“Do you not see this? Who is that?!” Barked Tina. “I don’t know her name but she’s a regular at this time. She typically runs every weekday. If you want to know who it is, why don’t I pull up her account?” Brett pulled up her account and Tina almost knocked him out of the way. The name was Tiffany Watts but in her profile picture was a standard photo of Brett in basic gym clothes. Tina began to panic as she internally freaked out and tried to peace together what is happening. Brett is running on the treadmill. It’s identical. But it’s not him.. “You don’t look so good. I’m going to go grab you some water” suggested Brett.<br />
<br />
She looked back at her watch where she remembered the weird feeling. Could…Could the watch have made this happen? Am I crazy for thinking this. She decided to click it again as she was looking at an older man squatting in the back. In the blink of an eye, the man was replaced with a copy of Brett. Same hair, clothes, everything. He was still squatting as the change did not seem to affect him. Tina looked at the watch with disbelief. How could this happen? Why is it Brett?<br />
<br />
After pondering the watch for a while, Tina realized she was thinking of the Brett both times and that’s why Brett may have been the one cloned. Because she was the one that clicked the button, she must have been the one who only notices the change. She wants to test it more but with a different subject. At that moment, a girl walked into the gym.<br />
<br />
It was Sarah Owens. Immediately Tina recognized the girl as Brett’s girlfriend. Sarah is 5’2” and has dark curly hair that does reach her shoulders. She was pretty athletic in build and probably sported a six pack. She was wearing a pink tank top that showed off her arm and shoulder definition. She was wearing black leggings and pink accented sandals to match her tank top. She had a bit of acne scaring but beautiful nonetheless. “Hey Tina!! Is Brett-y around?” <br />
<br />
“He will be right back to the front. How was you day?” Asked Tina. “Oh it was great! My favorite drink at Starbucks is back in season so I went and grabbed one of those. Then I headed to the mall….” Sarah continued as Tina thought about herself, looked at Sarah and pushed the button.<br />
<br />
Tina could only stare with her move gapping open in disbelief as Sarah continued. The girl talking was now a bit taller and drastically different. She now had long dirty blonde hair that was only interrupted by her shirt collar. She was now wearing the same gym polo, khakis, and converse shoes Tina was wearing. Here body looked less athletic and more like someone who wants to be lean and not muscular. You could tell her six pack abs were replaced with a more subtle, rounder stomach. Tina was looking at an exact physical copy of her.<br />
<br />
As Tina sat in astonishment as Sarah ended her story. Brett returned to the front and sat Tina’s water next to her. “Hey babe! What are you doing here?” Brett asked the new Tina lookalike before they met with a passionate kiss. Tina was kind of disturbed watching herself kiss Brett and even give him a bit of tongue. “I just needed you to sign some documents for our new apartment contract!” Sarah explained. “Okay…Hey Tina, you mind watching the front for a minute?” Asked Brett.<br />
Tina shook her head as she still couldn’t process what she was seeing. An exact copy of her just kissed her coworker and is now flirting with him as they walk to a separate area.<br />
<br />
Tina began to mess with the watch to see if she could reverse the change when she decided moving the dial once and click the button.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Tina felt dizzy and lost her sight for a moment. When she came to, she was now sitting at the desk with Brett as he signed the apartment documents. Time looked up to see herself standing at the front desk now talking with customers whom just walked up. She had hit the role swap feature of the watch and now was her but in the life of Sarah.</p>
