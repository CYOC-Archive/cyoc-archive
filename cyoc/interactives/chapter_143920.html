<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some searching they found the place Vect was looking for. Inside they spotted Duinir, Edran, and his twin Faral were sitting at one table. Upon seeing the group, Duinir motioned for them to join them. With the assistance of some staff, they pulled 3 more tables together for them all.<br />
&quot;So I hear your opponent never showed up,&quot; Duinir began.<br />
&quot;No, do you know anything about what might have happened,&quot; Vect asked.<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t heard a single thing about the guy or where he went.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surprisingly, I&#39;m enjoying watching the tournament,&quot; Faral said, &quot;haven&#39;t you Edran?&quot;<br />
After a moment of silence Edran reluctantly agreed. &quot;It has been.....interesting I suppose.&quot;<br />
&quot;It has been a fun event,&quot; Sara stated.<br />
&quot;So how does this food measure up to home,&quot; Beverly asked after finishing her bowl of appetizer soup.<br />
&quot;Actually it&#39;s very close,&quot; Duinir looked around at the decorations of the restaurant. &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say I was back home instead of being here in the human capital.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll reserve judgment until I taste the main course,&quot; Edran crossed his arms. As if to answer him, the actual meal arrived.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, its definitely better than a lot of places I&#39;ve eaten at in the homeland,&quot; Edran admitted after he finished his plate.<br />
&quot;The lad knows when to recognize greatness, he&#39;s got a good eye,&quot; Duinir laughed.<br />
The group had finished their meal and were chatting with each other about what to expect in the next few days, or swapping stories.<br />
Vect leaned closer to Duinir and Edran as the others were chatting. &quot;Are they yours,&quot; Vect whispered to him.<br />
&quot;Ah, noticed them too eh? No the pair of elves sitting in the corner aren&#39;t anyone I know.&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Who,&quot; Edran whispered urgently, looking around frantically.<br />
Faral leaned in and whispered in his ear, &quot;try not to make yourself obvious. The 2 high elves in that back corner have been stealing looks at us all meal.&quot;<br />
&quot;How did you-?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been trained my first 10 years of life in political intrigue. If I didn&#39;t spot them, I wouldn&#39;t be much of an heir, or did you think me a slacker who did his own thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh...so what do we do about them,&quot; he deflected.<br />
&quot;What do you mean? We continue with the night. If they try anything we know they&#39;re there.&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey Vect, isn&#39;t there someone you should introduce to everyone,&quot; Beverly asked a seat down from him.<br />
&quot;Still trying to find out how to word it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Word what,&quot; Duinir asked.<br />
&quot;Wait how did you know,&quot; Vect asked Beverly.<br />
&quot;The spirits can talk to each other if they&#39;re close enough.&quot;<br />
Duinir&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;You still look the same, so you didn&#39;t join with the spirit I guess.&quot;<br />
&quot;Right, but she helped create a link with me so i can talk to her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Her,&quot; Edran questioned.<br />
&quot;Here, join hands with me,&quot; Beverly said. Once they all held hands, she spoke a few words and they all found themselves in the forest clearing Vect and Erress were at earlier. To one side a white unicorn emerged, while Erress came in for a landing, careful not to land on top of anyone. Interestingly enough, Beverly looked just like she did before the joining, no horn.<br />
&quot;Nice to see Vect&#39;s friends finally,&quot; said Erress as she lay down.<br />
&quot;So this is your spirit? Impressive,&quot; Duinir gave a slight bow.<br />
&quot;I see you are a man of good taste,&quot; Erress bowed her head in turn. <br />
&quot;Erress, this is Duinir, Edran, Faral, Beverly, Vesper, Freed, Jack, Lelu, Mai, Eva, and Sara,&quot; Vect introduce each of them, Duinir noticing his very slight change in tone of voice when introducing Sara.<br />
&quot;And this is my spirit,&quot; Beverly indicated the unicorn, who simply nodded.<br />
&quot;Is there a name to go along with it,&quot; Jack joked.<br />
Beverly seemed to be searching for the proper way to answer the question. &quot;Unicorns don&#39;t have names for one another. They don&#39;t think in the way most people do. If you read stories on them, it describes unicorns as aloof and a superior attitude. This isn&#39;t intentional, they just don&#39;t experience emotions like we do. Regret and sorrow are foreign concepts to them.....as is language. Conversing with her is more an exchange of emotions and sensations rather than what you will experience.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? Not even thoughts of death,&quot; Edran asked.<br />
&quot;Yes, unicorns are mostly immortal.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then how did she end up a spirit,&quot; Eva crossed her arms.<br />
&quot;She was very very old, and wounded from a fight with a worg. She stumbled to a wood elf village and they proceeded with the process of placing her in the spirit vessel or horn in her case.&quot;<br />
&quot;On the subject of spirit vessels, I have a question,&quot; Faral spoke up turning to Erress.<br />
&quot;Proceed,&quot; Erress nodded.<br />
&quot;Your vessel is your heart correct?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why is it so small? I would have guessed a dragon&#39;s heart to be much larger.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah. Well that is for travel purposes. Would you want to carry around a beating heart the size of a large pumpkin or bigger?&quot;<br />
&quot;No I suppose not.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am glad you&#39;re here Vect. There is something I want to discuss with you. Is it ok if everyone else is here as well?&quot;<br />
&quot;I see no reason why not,&quot; shrugged Vect, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;How well do you know your family history?&quot;<br />
Vect was stunned for a moment from the randomness of the question.<br />
&quot;An odd question, but I can recite it 4 generations back. That&#39;s what I was taught when I was growing up at least. Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you ever notice anything...odd in your history? Any notes on prowess?&quot;<br />
Vect closed his eyes and ran through the past lessons that had been beaten into his head over and over. <br />
&quot;Well, most of the family show some promise with magic, but I figured that was mostly a quirk of the selective marriages. My brother is exceptionally talented at magic,&quot; he added.<br />
&quot;What are you getting at,&quot; Duinir stepped forward.<br />
&quot;And you,&quot; Erress asked Vect.<br />
As if to answer, Vect produced a small spark by snapping his fingers. &quot;Only the small bit Lelu taught us on the way to the camp, and shaman Gratz druid training.&quot;<br />
&quot;Dragon&#39;s can take on a human form if we so wish. This has allows some to have children with humanoid species. I have heard stories of such unions producing lineages of magic users. Our link has allowed me to feel the blood that runs through your veins. There are other such races that do similar: angels, demons, a few deities, ect. All have mingled with another other races due to affection or power.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, he&#39;s descended from a dragon from a long time ago. Neat,&quot; Jack smiled.<br />
&quot;But what does this have to do with us,&quot; Vect asked indicating himself and Erress.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure joining with you is a good idea. The other dragon&#39;s blood might cause...instabilities.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is his life in danger now,&quot; Edran demanded.<br />
&quot;No, not now. Not if he never joins with me. A joining would drastically increase his abilities, but if we join, it may lead to death if you are unable to endure the transformation.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do we proceed then,&quot; Duinir questioned.<br />
&quot;That is Vect&#39;s choice.&quot;<br />
After a few minutes of consideration Vect spoke, &quot;is there a way for me to prepare myself for a joining in the future?&quot;<br />
&quot;Physical and mental training could help, but that can only do so much. In the end, it will be up to you.&quot;<br />
Vect looked down, saddened. Then he looked up with a smile. &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;ll still bring you along with me so you can still experience the world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;We should probably be getting back to reality, I&#39;m sure some people would like to use our table,&quot; Freed suggested.<br />
<br />
As they left the restaurant and prepared to go their separate ways, Vect pulled Edran aside. <br />
&quot;Yes my lord?&quot;<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t have to call me that. I&#39;m just me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Apologies, years of training is hard to break.&quot;<br />
&quot;I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry for causing you so much stress. I know tradition is everything to you.&quot;<br />
After a pause Edran spoke. &quot;I hate watching you trample on generations of tradition, throwing it aside for personal ideals.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can appreciate tradition to a point, but why can I not choose my own path? Taegan is the elder brother, he will inherit the land and title. Father just sees me as a political tool. A thing to be married off to increase his power. I don&#39;t even know what her name is and yet I&#39;m to marry for a small amount of land,&quot; Vect kept his voice even.<br />
&quot;But even a small gain through marriage could have great gains.&quot;<br />
Vect sighed. &quot;I just wanted to apologize for earlier, not argue about our views. I hope you have a good night.&quot; And he turned to leave taking Sara&#39;s hand as he passed and Edran stood and watched the pair walk away holding hands and chatting happily with each other.</p>
