<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard went into her house and saw an immaculately cared for home. Everything in it's place.<br />
<br />
She looked at the pictures on the wall and saw her wedding to Paul. Two men standing up in front of a judge <br />
exchanging vows.<br />
<br />
They both looked quite hansom.<br />
<br />
Several years passed in the pictures and she sees her children appear in the pictures. They are two boys like <br />
they had name Simon and Roy just as her children were but they looked like neither of the two of them.<br />
<br />
A few pictures later and she sees the adoption papers perfectly framed.<br />
<br />
As the years roll on in the pictures she stops at the one of the four of them. She now had a full beard and <br />
Paul  was quite a bit rounder. <br />
<br />
I just lost my figure when you decided to have a family. He said chuckling to her at his little quip.<br />
<br />
Well you didn't have to stay home and be the house husband I could have done that. <br />
<br />
Well honey you know you have the higher paying job and there is no way you would have ever stayed home. <br />
Besides I like cooking and cleaning and looking after the boys.<br />
<br />
Richard realized he was snapping back at Paul like it was nothing that they were a married gay couple.<br />
<br />
Simon being the older of the two was in kindergarten and Paul said he had to go pick him up. He picked Roy up <br />
out of the play pen and put him in a harness that kept him close to his chest. He felt it made the bond closer <br />
and he used this with Simon as he grew up and now he was so close to Paul.<br />
<br />
Now off to work baby Paul said to Richard giving him a deep kiss between the beards. Thanks for the nooner. <br />
<br />
She was off and this seemed the strangest as she had always stayed home with their kids and now she was the <br />
highest wage earner in the household.<br />
<br />
When she got home the two were playing in the living room while Richard was cooking. He was a good cook as his <br />
400 pound 5'6&quot; body showed. There he was in a frilly apron laboring at the stove. He had taken off his shirt <br />
and she saw the fur peaking out of the sides of his frilly apron. He wasn't really nelly, the apron was sort <br />
of a joke Richard had remembered buying for him when they had decided on who would take care of the kids and <br />
he embraced the apron.<br />
<br />
As Richard came home from work he had noticed that it seemed as though almost every house on the block had a <br />
rainbow, bear or leather stripe flag hanging from the flag poles. And he thought holly crap he was living in a <br />
gay community.<br />
<br />
When he wrapped his arms around Paul, which wasn't easy to do he whispered that he loved him.<br />
<br />
Paul said not now I have to get ready. Carl and Jordan are coming over. You know every third Friday night we <br />
have them over. Now you just watch the kids and read your paper while I get ready.<br />
<br />
Paul went up stairs and showered and got ready and as he was bounding down the stairs, well bounding down as <br />
much as a 400 pound man can, the door bell rang and there were two men that Richard didn't recognize. They had <br />
a young male child with them. <br />
<br />
Well now this must be Dustin. Richard said. He must be about Simon's age. Come on in.<br />
<br />
Paul gave both Carl and Jordan a quick peck lasting a little too long on Jordan for Richards liking and he let <br />
out a rough cough.<br />
<br />
Oh my big bad jealous bubba bear. You know I love you. Just because Jordan and I had a thing before we met <br />
doesn't mean I want to get back with him.<br />
<br />
The two were football player types. Both had the big barrel chest and thick arms and legs.<br />
<br />
Richard gave them a quick pec and asked them to sit down while Richard excused himself to finish dinner.<br />
<br />
It wasn't more than a few moments when Richard announced dinner is served.<br />
<br />
Leading everyone into the dinning room the four of them sat at the big table while the kids sat at a little <br />
table in sight of Richard.<br />
<br />
They had a lovely evening and Richard began to loose his memories of being a woman as the evening went on and <br />
within months she had no more twinges of memory save a little feeling now and then.</p>
