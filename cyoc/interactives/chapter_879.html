<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul immediately flopped on to his back, knowing that it would be a lot harder for Don to see what was going on just by looking at his legs. &quot;Hey Don,&quot; Paul said.
<br>
 &quot;I was just going to take a nap.&quot; Paul swung his legs up on the bed and started to turn towards the pillow. He moved so he could look at Don. 'What a great
<br>
 looking kid I have,' he thought proudly. &quot;What are your plans tonight?&quot; Paul asked. 
<br>

<br>
 Don was a little surprised at having caught his dad naked, so he backed towards the door. &quot;I'm just going to shave and hit the shower,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll be going out in
<br>
 another hour or so.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Paul rolled onto his stomach to hide his growing boner. &quot;OK, &quot; he said. &quot;Have fun.&quot; Don left and closed the door behind him. Paul reached down to massage the tip
<br>
 of his cock. 'Don is sure hot,' Paul thought, slowly enjoying himself. 'I wish I could get him to suck me off,' he thought. 
<br>

<br>
 One little corner of Paul's mind tried to protest that Don was HIS OWN SON FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, to say nothing of the queer angle. But in his reduced state,
<br>
 pleasure seemed so much more important than any silly rules. He heard Don turn on the electric razor, and hatched a plan to get his blowjob. 
<br>

<br>
 Paul put on a robe. It didn't really fit any more, dragging on the ground when he walked, but it would give him cover in case of anything unexpected. Then he snuck
<br>
 to the bathroom door, and leaned against the wall right next to where Don was shaving. He passed the time masturbating, tickling his balls, rubbing his hairy chest
<br>
 and tweaking his nipples. 
<br>

<br>
 Before long, Don turned the razor off and Paul heard him pull back the shower curtain. The water came on, and Paul heard Don say, &quot;Hm. That doesn't seem
<br>
 right.&quot; Paul smiled, knowing that his plan was working. The tub creaked as Don stepped in and pulled the curtain closed. 
<br>

<br>
 Under the cover of Don's shower, Paul crept into the bathroom, leaving the door open behind him. He could see Don's silhouette against the opaque shower
<br>
 curtain. It was definitely shorter; almost the same height as Paul. That was cool! Paul felt his dick pulse with excitement as he took off his robe and laid it on the
<br>
 toilet. Looking back at the silhouette, he was excited to see it was already shorter than when he had come into the room. He beat off, watching his firstborn shrink,
<br>
 practically before his own eyes. 
<br>

<br>
 Don was down to a little less than 4' 6&quot; when he rinsed all the shampoo out of his hair and opened his eyes again. He reached for the conditioner and of course
<br>
 missed, knocking it onto the bottom of the tub. He picked up the bottle and felt how heavy it seemed. It was too big. He looked around and saw how much bigger
<br>
 everything was. This wasn't right at all. He punched the faucet off and yanked the curtain open with his other hand, to expose his bigger musclebear father jacking
<br>
 off! &quot;Dad!&quot; he exclaimed in shock. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I'm sorry you had to learn about it this way,&quot; dad said. &quot;But as you can see for yourself, we have a curse in this family. I meant to tell you about it before you
<br>
 turned 18, but I didn't think you'd believe me. As you can see, the curse makes adult men in the family shrink.&quot; He slowed his stroking, but kept one fist firmly on
<br>
 his big dick. 
<br>
 Don frowned. His dad sounded completely insane. But their reduced statures were undeniable. He thought his dad had looked shorter on the bed, but it was hard
<br>
 to tell. Standing there, it was obvious that he was less than five feet tall. Don figured he was closing in on four feet himself, and still shrinking. Don looked at his
<br>
 dad's boner, which seemed to have grown just in the time they were talking. &quot;OK. I can't deny that I'm shrinking, and so are you. But what is that for?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;The only way for you to get your height back is to suck the cum out of my dick. I've been getting it ready so we could do this quickly. It will go faster if you tickle
<br>
 my balls, too.&quot; Paul said. So far, his plan had worked perfectly.... now what?</p>
