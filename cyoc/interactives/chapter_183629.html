<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four friends all looked out the window and up at the army soldiers who had just landed on the roof of the hotel across from them. They were wearing green camo uniforms with rifles and machine guns at the ready. They looked inhuman wearing their black gas masks and every part of their bodies where covered so no flesh could be seen. <br />
<br />
“Biohazard uniforms.” Said Barbara as she tensed up a bit as one of the riflemen aimed right at them and gave them a jester to back away from the window. She relaxed a bit, she could understand why the men or women in those uniforms would be tense seeing four monsters by the window looking at them. Only Elizabeth stayed close to the window, as a fairy she likely had the least threatening look of them all. It must have been enough for the soldier who lowered his or her weapon, it was impossible to tell the gender at this distance and with all that gear on.<br />
<br />
None of that mattered because a few moments later, there was a rumble sound as the room shook causing the TV which was mounted to the wall to fall and the two large mirrors to come crashing down as well. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” yelled Lindsay as suddenly the soldiers began to open on something on the roof above them. <br />
<br />
All four rushed back to the window to see, the soldiers firing their weapons at something, even a rocket went flying and exploded above them but did not seem to do anything. Across from them they could see the doors of hotel rooms where transformed people had been following orders to remain indoor flew open. As they did a made mix of different types of creatures came running out. A few jumped off the railing into the courtyard/pool area and a few even tried to fly. <br />
<br />
“Just to keep me locked up now!!! I am out of Prison once and for all!!!” laughed a rumbling voice as the building shook again as something jumped off the roof above them and landed on the roof where the soldiers were. Standing there was a giant or maybe it was a cyclops, hard to tell with their back to them. It had however to look away as he swung at the soldiers with some kind of sword, only when he paused for a moment holding it up in the air did they see it was a blade from a helicopter. He swung at a few soldiers cutting them to bits as he laughed. <br />
<br />
“My God, I never considered about what crazy people or criminals would do if they got transformed into stuff like that.” said Stacy as the giant, likely a convict who transformed in some jail nearby kept on his rampage.<br />
<br />
The soldiers where slaughtered by the transformed giant who raised the bloody blade in victory, but it was a short-lived victory as swooping down from the sky came a giant bird made totally of fire, it grabbed the giant, it’s claws digging into flesh in a way bullets couldn’t before lifting it off of the ground. The giant slashed upwards with the blade causing both he and the fire bird to fall on the roof of <br />
the hotel. The fire bird, being made of fire caught the building on fire which began to quickly consume that side of the hotel. <br />
<br />
“We need to get out of here?” ordered Barbara as the flames begin to lick up the other side of the hotel. They where on the other side of the Hotel but it was only a matter of time until the flames reached them. <br />
<br />
“Make sure you grab your phones, wallets and the like.” Ordered Barbara “We may need to ID ourselves.”<br />
<br />
“Our photos will not match!” countered Lindsay to her sister, as she threw some stuff into a small over the shoulder bag. <br />
<br />
“Just do it.” Snapped Stacy<br />
<br />
That took only a few seconds and they were off, rushing out of the room and toward the stairs, it was a mad house as all these different types of creatures tried to head down stairs and not all of them could go down easily. Two large Centaurs were blocking the way as they tried to head down on hooves, this caused panic behind them and stopped the girls in their tracks. The flames were getting ever closer, maybe the fire bird was so hot or the water pressure and therefore the sprinklers where out but they didn’t have much time.<br />
<br />
“Guys…you two have wings get out of here.” Ordered Stacy as she looked at Barbara and Lindsay, they where by the edge of the railing and could look down into the courtyard/pool area which was quickly filling with smoke. <br />
<br />
“I am not leaving you two.” Stated Barbara <br />
<br />
“Then carry us down….” Stated Lindsay “We are only 3 stories up.” <br />
<br />
“Worth a shot.” Said Elizabeth as they headed toward the railing. Others must have gotten that idea, some where climbing down while others where flying. There was no room for Barbara to extend her wings on the inside of the railing, so she climbed over the edge and while hanging on extended her wings. It was the first time they where fully extended and they had to be at least 6 or 7 feet across, she gave them a few test flicks before letting go of the edge and let herself hover there. She felt so powerful, a flying dragon woman it was intoxicating. <br />
<br />
For Elizabeth who had tested her smaller wings in the room the process was easier, she flew over the edge and just hovered there, however Barbara noticed that Elizabeth was giving off a slight blue light glow in the darken smoke filled air and she couldn&#39;t hide her smile for being up in the air.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I can carry anyone of you down.” She admitted.<br />
<br />
“That is alright.” Said Stacy as she looked over the edge herself and extending her claws began to gracefully climb down and even leapt the final story to land on the ground with easy. It was strange to watch but also a massive turn on for Barbara to watch her girlfriend move with such grace and skill to the ground. <br />
<br />
“I am not trying that.” Stated Lindsay as she extended her hands which her sister took and together, they flew down toward the ground, a dragon woman carrying a female nine tailed fox. Once on the ground they ran out of the large tunnel which led from the pool area past the lobby to the street. <br />
<br />
By now they were on the street, they had not seen the world aside from the pool area outside of the TV show. <br />
<br />
“What now?” inquired Stacy as the four of them stood on the road beside a destroyed pick-up truck, watching the hotel burn down. Power was clearly down; the whole street was dark aside from the light from burning buildings. Aside from the snacks they had in their hotel room, none of them had eaten anything so they would soon be hungry. All four begin to look around. <br />
<br />
 It was one thing to see these scenes on a TV screen but to see the destroyed buildings, to smell the smoke, to hear the animal like screams and the sound of gunfire with your own eyes and ears was a totally different thing. Some people like them where watching the fire consume the hotel, others were running away heading God knows where. <br />
<br />
Night was beginning to fall which made look even more horrifying, however the really scary monsters tended to come out at night and the army was still fighting in the city the roar of fighters and the sounds of heavy guns added to the smoke and sounds of creatures.</p>
