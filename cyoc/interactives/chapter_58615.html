<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as Jeff tried to push the remaining hairs down into the neck of his T-Shirt, he heard his brother Jason climbing the stairs.  It was summer break and his brother was home from college.  Jeff decided to play it cool and act like nothing was going on even though his chest was itching like crazy.  He realized that it was going to take time to get used to his new hairy body.<br />
Jason knocked on Jeff's bedroom door.  &quot;Hey Bro, me and some of my buddies are going down to the practice field to play a little football, you want to join us?&quot;<br />
Jeff thought for a minute and decided it would be fun to play a little football and show off a little<br />
...only after a few more minor modifications.<br />
&quot;Sure Bro, give me about 5 minutes.&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem, I'll be in the kitchen grabbing a snack.&quot;, Jason replied as he headed back down the stairs.<br />
Jeff pulled up the main menu on the Chronvac once again.<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
MUSCULAR INDEX<br />
Current Status: 2/10<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Jeff thought for a minute...&quot;I need to be able to run with the big guys, but not out-do them to the point of raising suspicions&quot;<br />
He raised to bar to a 6 and thought that would be sufficient.<br />
Well, if I'm going to be a semi-jock, I might as well look like one in another area as well.<br />
Going into the genital modification menu, Jeff saw that his current penis/scrotum size was rated as a 4/10 on index scale.  Jeff bumped the index up to a 8 and thought to himself that a 10 would be porn-star status and would probably draw too much attention.<br />
Jeff hit the &quot;Go&quot; button and ran to his mirror.<br />
He watched as his muscles grew...biceps, triceps, pecs all started inflating...stretching the fabric of his T-Shirt to its limits.  Jeff was very impressed, next he felt a tingling in his groin and started to feel his penis snaking its way down his leg as it lengthened.  Next he felt the fabric of his shorts around his crotch getting tighter and tighter as his balls doubled in size to that of medium-sized oranges.<br />
Jeff thought to himself....&quot;Wow! This is so cool!&quot;<br />
Looking at himself side-ways in the mirror, he noticed the mound in the crotch area of his shorts stood out at least 3 inches over there rest of his body.  <br />
Anyone would be able to tell that he was packing one hell of a piece of meat.<br />
Sitting down to put on his shoes, Jeff couldn't help but notice how hairy the tops of his feet were and how his shorts looks like they were stretched to their limit around his muscular legs and his very large package.<br />
After getting his final shoe on, he rushed out of his room and down the stairs where Jason was waiting at the door for him.<br />
&quot;Ready Bro?&quot; Jason asked.<br />
&quot;Let's go.&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
The drive to the football field was a little uncomfortable.  Jeff kept noticing how his brother kept glancing at him like he knew something was different but could not put his finger on it.<br />
&quot;Have you been working out little brother?&quot;<br />
&quot;A little.&quot; Jeff lied.<br />
&quot;I haven't noticed how much you have grown since I saw you last Christmas Break.  You've definitely hit puberty plus some.&quot; Jason laughed.<br />
Jeff just smiled to himself.<br />
Arriving at the football field, Jeff noticed there were alot of people there.  Most were friends the same age as Jason, but there were also some younger teenage girls and boys that were the same age as Jeff.  His best friend Mark just happened to be there as well.<br />
Jeff ran by to say &quot;Hi&quot; to his friend Mark and quickly all the players started gathering in a circle to decide teams.<br />
The teams were soon divided up and Jeff ended up on his brother's team.<br />
&quot;Okay, we're going to be the shirts, and you guys are the skins&quot; said the other team's captain.<br />
Jeff almost panicked when he realized that both his brother and best friend had not seen him shirtless since his massive body hair growth and muscular development.<br />
Going for broke, Jeff pulled his T-Shirt over his head and threw it to the side lines.  He had to admit it was a relief to get it off, it was already too tight for him and all the extra insulation now had made it very hot.  In fact, when he looked down at his torso, the thick hair on his chest and stomach was matted against his skin.  It almost looked like he had just got out of the shower they were so wet. <br />
His brother was the first to notice the difference as a look of shock came over his face.  Jeff noticed his brother looking at his own shirtless torso and sensing his own inadequacy with his hairless chest and faint treasure trail.<br />
Soon the game was underway and Jeff was having the time of his life showing off his new body.  He noticed he was much more sexually mature at 16 years old that all the college-aged boys on the field.  He noticed some of his brother's friends checking out his huge crotch with a look of jealousy on their faces.<br />
Soon it was half-time and Jeff walked over to the bleachers where his best friend Mark was sitting along with some other girls his age.  He noticed several of the girls whispering and checking him out as strutted up. <br />
Before he could sit down, Mark whispered to him, &quot;Dude, what the hell happened to you?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's a new fitness program I'm on.&quot; Jeff laughed.<br />
Jeff sat down and causally stretched back against bleachers as he crossed his arms behind his head.  His underarm hair was so thick, you could not see any skin.  You couldn't tell where his thick pit hair started and his thick chest hair ended as they were all grown together.  The only clue was the denser bush directly under his arm.  <br />
He quickly adjusted his 10 inch soft dick so that it wouldn't accidentally pop out the inside leg of his shorts and pushed his huge balls up so that he wouldn't sit on them.  He realized that this would now be necessary every time he sit down to avoid injury.<br />
Soon he had all the girls around him telling him how great he was at football.  One of them even asked to run her hands through his hairy muscular chest and stomach. Of course, Jeff readily obliged.<br />
Jeff was basking in all the attention and hated to get up and get back in the game.<br />
Jeff finished out the game playing the best football game of his life. <br />
After the game, all the players were giving Jeff a pat on the back for his performance.  Many of them were asking him which college he played for and when he informed them he was only a 16-year old high student, they were shocked.<br />
Mark ran up to Jeff and asked him if they could walk back to Jeff's house.  Mark had a million questions for Jeff.<br />
Jeff told his brother he was walking and decided to forgo his shirt as he threw it in the back of Jason's car.<br />
Soon Mark started questioning Jeff.<br />
&quot;What did you do man?  How?&quot;, Mark asked.<br />
&quot;Well man, I've got a new program I bought over the Internet called the Chronvac.&quot;<br />
Jeff went on to explain how it all happened.<br />
&quot;Man, you've got to let me try it out!&quot;, Mark exclaimed.<br />
&quot;Sure, but first I've got to run in this convenience store and get me something to drink.&quot;<br />
Jeff noticed the 'No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service' sign on the door, but decided to ignore it.<br />
As he was getting his Gatorade out the cooler, he noticed how people were staring at him.<br />
Getting his drink, he walked up to the counter to pay for it.  The guy behind the counter was really checking Jeff out as Jeff was waiting in line. Jeff occasionally scratched his hairy chest and stomach and adjusted his package as if it was just a natural thing to do.  Jeff didn't even realize he was doing it.<br />
When it was finally Jeff's turn, the guy behind the counter started talking to him.<br />
&quot;Aren't you Jason's little brother?&quot; the guy asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm Sean.  I graduated high school with your brother. I remember you when you were just a kid.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah?&quot;  Jeff nonchalantly asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're certainly not a kid anymore.&quot; Sean laughed as he pointed to Jeff's chest and moved his finger down to until it was pointing at Jeff's bulging crotch.<br />
Jeff laughed as well, &quot;No not anymore.&quot;<br />
Sean looked around to see if anyone was around and leaned over the counter and handed Jeff a card and whispered &quot;He's my cell number, give me a call sometime and let's get together.&quot;<br />
Jeff was very flattered.  After all, he always had a little crush on Sean when he was younger.  This was about the time Jeff started figuring out he was Bi.<br />
&quot;Sure, I'll give you a call before this weekend.&quot; Jeff winked.<br />
Jeff made his way back outside where Mark was waiting.<br />
&quot;Did you get it?&quot; Mark asked referring to the Gatorade.<br />
&quot;Yeah, plus a phone number.&quot; Jeff laughed as they then made their way back towards Jeff's house.</p>
