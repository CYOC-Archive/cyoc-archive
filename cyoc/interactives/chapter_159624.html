<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked into the options of the Age Package, and noted it was not limited to simply regressing or progressing him, and there were a number of changes that could be done in terms of how someone aged. Lots of potential here, he mused to himself. Jeff was thinking when he saw that the device could access and show what other people were doing right now. Maybe that could give him some ideas. He checked the device&#39;s available targets, and it seemed to send up a pulse of energy before listing off the potential targets for a change.<br />
<br />
Brian Nelton (Father). Jeff was curious, that was his dad. Jeff&#39;s dad Brian was something of a jock in high school, as he was so fond of showing off when he brought out the pictures. At 39 now, Brian was still a large, strong, stocky man, visibly very muscular but only slightly softened in his appearance by a slight layer of fat. Even so, the local girls made no secret of their attraction to Brian, which always made Jeff wince. Figuring there could be no harm in it, Jeff decided to check what his dad was doing...<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww fuck yes!&quot; Brian Nelton stood, naked, in his room, vigorously pumping his cock into his hand. He shot himself a cocky grin and then went back to it. Still ever the stud. Even the addition of slight grayed hairs at the edges of his brow lent him nothing but a matured, sexy edge. Sure he was nothing if not faithful to his wife, but Brian was far from the chaste older man. He tensed his pecs and flexed his free hand as he pumped away. Sure his wife said she&#39;d prefer it if he didn&#39;t fap off during the day, but she was off at work and he was at home &quot;doing work on the computer&quot;.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d finished an hour earlier, and as they say, when the cats are away the mice will----<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YES!&quot; Brian grunted to himself through grit teeth. He couldn&#39;t well let Jeff or anyone else visiting or nearby get any inclination of what he was actually doing in his room. Brian came explosively, though the intensity was indeed starting to diminish from the stunning orgasms of his youth. He&#39;d made sure to have an old pair of underwear on hand to cum into, and Brian wiped off his brow as he finished. He stood there, red faced and smirking, and then started to put on a pair of boxers and a tank top. Still time to get his shows in.<br />
<br />
He threw his rag under the bed, where he could retrieve it if he needed another bit of, ahem, stress relief...<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Jeff felt more than a little grossed out. He&#39;d not just witnessed his dad uh, take care of himself, but he hadn&#39;t been able to turn off the damned machine&#39;s viewing program! It was like a trainwreck that he couldn&#39;t make himself look away from. An alarmingly sexy trainwreck that probably said things about Jeff&#39;s mentality. &quot;How screwed up am I? I just watched my dad work himself off...&quot; He shook his head and looked at some of the other options.<br />
<br />
Oh boy.<br />
<br />
Brady Charles. That guy from school was absolutely intolerable. The Captain of the Lacrosse Team, Brady was big, tall and tough, a muscular and highly aggressive guy whose position had not attenuated his tendencies. He was only moderately nicer to the women at school, and that was only because he wanted to have sex with them. He only treated guys as muscular and strong as him like human beings. Otherwise, you were dirt - lower than dirt really - to him.<br />
<br />
Did Jeff really want to see what Brady was up to?<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged and hit the button to start showing him what Brady was up to. And his mouth slowly started to hang slack open...<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t...you...&quot; Brady grunted as he pistoned his hips, thrusting deep into his lieutenant Greg&#39;s ass, &quot;dare...&quot; He gripped Greg&#39;s chest tight and pushed himself up against Greg&#39;s back, holding his dick in there deep, &quot;tell anybody we do this, Greg. I&#39;m no homo. I just...I gotta have this every now and then...&quot;<br />
<br />
A half-hearted reply came from the muscular defensive player under Brady, &quot;Yeah...yeah Brady, you&#39;re...you&#39;re totally straight...ooh fuck, Brady...&quot; As much as Greg didn&#39;t want to admit it, he liked it when the Team Captain did this to him. Maybe he was a little gayer than he acted too, but Greg was starting to like the way Brady took him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m the fucking hottest guy at school. I can have ANYBODY...&quot; Brady was obviously getting off on both Greg...and himself. He flexed his arm and checked himself out. Dick deep in another guy, and getting that guy to say Brady was undoubtedly straight. Yeah, Brady was the biggest, strongest guy at school. And he could have whatever the fuck he wanted. And that meant having Greg right now!<br />
<br />
Brady kept thrusting, and felt a sordid sort of delight when he dragged moans out of Greg, the red headed brutal defensive player reduced from a bully in his own right to Brady&#39;s BITCH. &quot;You like this...you like this...ohh fuck I&#39;m gonna cum! I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite Greg&#39;s stated preference for when they fucked around like this, Brady made sure he came inside of Greg. Because he was Brady Charles, and he could do whatever the fuck he wanted.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Well.<br />
<br />
Jeff knew that Brady and Greg were kinda close, and they seemed to hang out a lot. But it seemed that there was a definite masochism tango going on between them. Brady having a thing for the occasional gay fling was not anticipated. But Jeff was not surprised to learn that Brady was still a domineering asshole even when he was in the midst of such a tryst. Jeff figured he kind of romanticized the idea of such a thing bringing out a more vulnerable side from Brady.<br />
<br />
A side that evidently did not quite exist.<br />
<br />
The last option was Jeff&#39;s brother Johannes, a muscular, slicked back punk who often tried to make his punk band a reality...only to run into one problem or another. Jeff did not care for Johannes in part for the rough and abrasive treatment he got from him. Johannes was mean, sarcastic, and didn&#39;t care to curate his statements. Well, Jeff thought, at least his brother couldn&#39;t be involved in something sexual, scandalous or sexually scandalous. That would be 3 of 3, and too great a chance occurrence.<br />
<br />
So Jeff went ahead and clicked to see what Johannes was doing...<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Johannes and Steph laid beside one another at the top of a hill nearby the house. Thankfully for the sanity of their onlooker, they had at least finished their business some ten minutes earlier. Johannes was resting on his back on the substantially sweat stained towels they&#39;d brought up there, and Steph had already gotten dressed again in a spare set of street clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve GOT to lay off of Jeff, Johannes.&quot; Steph said and propped herself up next to him.<br />
<br />
The still denuded Johannes sighed, &quot;So soon after sex...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, so soon after sex.&quot; She sighed, and said, &quot;He&#39;s your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s dad&#39;s favorite.&quot; Johannes grumbled, &quot;Dad respects the nerdy guy more than me, cuz the nerd...is gonna go on to make a bajillion dollars in the future. While me? I work on motorcycles. I ride around trying to make music work and failing. Bad.&quot; Johannes looked out at the house, and said, &quot;...little shit&#39;s so easy to scare and offend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he doesn&#39;t have your physical advantages, Johannes.&quot; Steph said, and then put a hand on his shoulder, &quot;I get why you&#39;re not his biggest fan. I mean, with all that happened with your dad and the school folks...fucking favoritism and prejudice at work. But Jeff? Jeff hasn&#39;t done anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He just benefits without realizing it. And I think...&quot; Johannes said as he kicked a pebble down the hill, &quot;That&#39;s why I can&#39;t stand him. Fucking straight lace kid. But...you&#39;re right. It&#39;s not fair of me. He&#39;s my brother. And I&#39;m...not doin&#39; him right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph rested her head against his broad shoulder, crowned with a tattoo, &quot;And there&#39;s the caring man who just made love to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just tryin&#39; to make sure I do right. I don&#39;t always get it right, but I try to at least course correct when I can.&quot; Johannes said, starting to stretch and think about where this was all going. However before long, the slicked back punk felt something. He grinned at Steph and asked, &quot;Babe, you ready to go again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Johannes, seriously? I just got dressed! ...Oh alright.&quot; She kissed him on the lips, checked if anyone else was around their hill hideaway, and then commenced straddling him and starting to disrobe again...<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Jeff stopped and sighed. He just saw so much of Johannes in one moment leaving aside the prior sexuality. Johannes and Steph were a surprisingly good couple, and he&#39;d seen a side of his older brother he&#39;d never thought to ever see. He only knew Johannes as an abrasive loner who always picked on him, but to see that was the reason? Damn but there were some dynamics at play. Hopefully, Jeff thought, he could get Johannes to not be so mean going forward. Cuz he seemed like a cool guy in that glimpse at his relationship.<br />
<br />
So this left Jeff with some choices as to who he was going to change...</p>
