<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gleb opened the case. Looking at rows of tiny containers, sitting tight in their slots, made him sigh. Several <br />
dozens of vials which contained years of his work. And it ends here, with him. What good was this scientific <br />
search, if it couldn't help against the raiders? What good is it, if it couldn't save lives when it was needed <br />
most? Yes, modifications he offered were only supposed to help people with somewhat minor and casual troubles, <br />
heal them… But this case contains more than that. Modifications he never offered to anyone, untested, maybe <br />
outright dangerous. Modifications capable of changing one into something that is much more than human. Based <br />
on local fauna, as well as other creatures across the galaxy, those were capable of freeing one from <br />
limitations of human body. He was afraid to offer those to his fellow villagers. He was afraid to lose their <br />
trust and friendship by offering them mutations that would set them apart from other humans. But most of all… <br />
He was afraid that they’d take his offer. That they’d like it. And that he’d turn this peaceful, ordinary <br />
settlement into a town of inhumans. And to people around… what would it look like? They’d see a picture from <br />
those stupid holo-shows and movies – a domain of mad scientist, guarded by inhuman servants.  <br />
<br />
Gleb closed his eyes, feeling something wet on his face. He knew what it was. Tears, bitter tears of defeat. <br />
Maybe… Maybe it would have been better if it happened like that. His friends and patients would be alive. They <br />
would be changed, but still alive. They’d be feared and possibly despised, but they would still live. And if <br />
they would have been attacked, they’d repel the raid easily with those new bodies. But instead… They are all <br />
dead and he is left to mourn their deaths here. All alone. <br />
<br />
In the end it didn’t matter that their village hadn’t alienated other people. They were seen as prey by <br />
raiders. A prey that is stronger than some others, but prey nonetheless. Gleb clenched his fists. It’s so <br />
natural, yet so unfair! Safety can only be gained through superior strength. He could have offered the village <br />
a power to become safe, yet his indecisiveness didn’t even offer them a choice…<br />
<br />
But… Enough of that. Gleb rubbed his face, sighing. Enough self-pity.  There are more pressing concerns. For <br />
one – his own survival. Even if raiders lost him, he’s still all alone in this forest. No food, no water, no <br />
comms. A handgun. No skills of survival. Assuming the handgun works, he can hope to shoot something. To defend <br />
himself against predators once or twice, maybe even get some meat. But even this is a long shot. He knew too <br />
well how slim his chances are against creatures of this planet. Perhaps that’s why raiders are not in a hurry <br />
to pursuit him. To them, he is a dead man already. Not that it’s far from the truth. Best case scenario – <br />
he’ll survive two or three days. Not nearly enough to get out of the woods. <br />
<br />
Wrapping his fingers around the gun’s rough handle, Gleb pulled it out carefully from his pocket. Barely <br />
charged. <br />
<br />
An almost inaudible chuckle comes from the figure, sitting with a back against a tree. Ironic, really… The <br />
only thing that can help him is the case. He can use those experimental mutagens. It will give him a chance. <br />
Refined, distilled and improved abilities of beasts will give him a chance against the forest. But it is, <br />
most-likely, a one-way ticket. Even in the best case scenario, if everything goes absolutely as intended, <br />
reversing it won’t be possible for years… If he turns himself into a monstrous hybrid now, he’ll have to live <br />
like that. Even when he escapes the woods and reaches civilization, he won’t be able to go back to human body. <br />
He’d need to rebuild the lab and spend who knows how long researching the way to reverse mutations. So it’s <br />
ironic indeed… All those thoughts about weak and strong, prey and predators… In the end, he can only accept <br />
himself as prey or try to become predator. And only predators can survive here.  <br />
<br />
Will he have a place among humans if he subjects himself to this?  Somehow it’s hard to see a positive answer <br />
to this question. And more importantly… It’s strange to realize this, but he won’t really want that place. To <br />
come back to civilized world… It actually feels stupid now. It’s so clear and obvious now – that world is <br />
dirty, dishonest, cruel and is filled with hypocrisy. What’s good about it? Comfort? Communication with <br />
others? If he turns himself into monster, he’ll be as comfortable in these woods. And he has no slightest wish <br />
to face others. To see their hypocritical eyes that shine with egoistical desires, that display true nature of <br />
those two-faced predators…<br />
<br />
It might be best to just remain here. Turn oneself into something that can survive here, and stay. Build a <br />
hideout and enjoy the safety… Doesn’t sound so bad. But no, it’s not something that he needs to think about <br />
now. Whatever he does later, he first needs to decide, which of those mutagens will be most helpful, which <br />
will give him highest chance of survival…<br />
<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, Gleb put the case aside with a sigh. Most mutagens held helpful qualities, but neither <br />
of them was the ultimate form he’d be ready to stay as for a long time. Or maybe, entire life even… Reptilian, <br />
marine, insectoid, fast, strong, agile, tough, more intelligent, with better reflexes… Each form had it’s pros <br />
and cons, but they were somewhat narrowly specialized. And he needed versatile form. There was one possibility <br />
however. Bottom right vial. His most special experiment.<br />
<br />
Gleb pulled the container out of its seat, bringing it close to his face. An experiment that took years and is <br />
still far from being over. Experiment that could not guarantee a successful transformation. With others he <br />
knew – they at least have somewhat stable result, they wouldn’t cause one to dissolve into biomass or explode. <br />
This one however… Theoretically, it worked. But how exactly would it work in reality – it couldn’t be <br />
predicted.<br />
<br />
Basic structure is a DNA of a peculiar mollusc from recently discovered world, which has unparalleled ability <br />
to absorb and process genetic material, changing itself through improvement of its own genetic code. Gleb had <br />
to pay a small fortune to get his hands on a sample of “clean” species. Anyway, creature’s use of this ability <br />
wasn’t extremely impressive. What Gleb had wanted was a possibility of conscious control over genetic code in <br />
one’s body. And he has been successful, mostly. In its present version, the mutagen combines DNA of mollusc, <br />
Queen species of ant-like insects and portions of genetic code of specific viruses.<br />
The worst part was that resulting mutagenic genome was highly unpredictable, recombining itself in unusual <br />
ways each time due to features of mollusc genetic ability. In addition, it could only work on X-chromosomes in <br />
humans, so additional programming had to be made – as a result, upon facing XY chromosome structure, it would <br />
duplicate X chromosomes, eliminating Y ones. So, it would effectively turn one into female on genetic level… <br />
On the plus side, it will grant outstanding regenerative ability, and hybrid body will have redundant nervous <br />
system, attaining two additional copies of central nervous system. <br />
<br />
Anyway, for Gleb, this meant that, if everything works, he’ll be able to take all of his mutagens without fear <br />
of incompatibility, storing various traits until they are needed. In short, this is the closest anyone ever <br />
came to shapeshifting, seemingly simple ability, if one remembers various films and shows… And still – the <br />
risks involved were far greater than with anything else. <br />
<br />
There was very little choice, if Gleb wanted to stay alive. And he had nothing to lose. In the end, after some <br />
hesitation, he made up his mind…</p>
