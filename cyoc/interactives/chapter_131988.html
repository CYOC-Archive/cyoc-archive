<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wendy here once again, sorry for not updating in a month, but suddenly becoming eleven people has kept us all busy. <br />
<br />
Three big universal changes have affected the group and serval smaller one has affected individuals among the group. First, to support our selves, most of our numbers have gotten jobs. Second, all of us have experienced great increases in libido, it is quite hard to focus unless we find a regular source of sex or masturbate frequently, many of my ‘sisters’ have taken to sleeping with each other. And lastly, perhaps our most unusual change to date, around Lily’s usual ‘time of the month’ each and every one of us laid at least one egg. <br />
<br />
Thus I’m adding Job, Sex, and Egg categories to my observations, as before, to alleviate any confusion I will begin by describing how Lily previously looked and acted before describing me and my ‘sisters’.<br />
<br />
Subject L-00 Lily<br />
Hair: shoulder length, brown<br />
Eyes: brown <br />
Face: plain<br />
Breasts: A-cup<br />
Height: 5’3” <br />
Job: owned and operated a family run camping site left to her by her parents.<br />
Sex: had a long-time boyfriend Ron, was healthily active with him<br />
Eggs: Didn’t lay eggs, has lighter than average periods. <br />
Overall opinion: vary plain and average looking<br />
<br />
Subject L-01 Wendy [Self]<br />
Hair: Dark brown bowl cut<br />
Eyes: moss green <br />
Face: freckled, and I now have a large gap in my front teeth that makes me lisp.<br />
Breasts: A-cup<br />
Height: 5’9” <br />
Job: Got myself employment doing some programing from home, Lily never learned how to program but I seem to just know how, read odd behaver below.<br />
Sex: I have mostly engaged in masturbation, with a few one night stands with the other girls.    <br />
Eggs: I laid a total of three eggs. <br />
Other mutations: I’ve grown about a foot long tail sprouting from my tailbone, its tip can flower open and reveal a 3 inch when erect, animal-like cock. I can even ejaculate with it.<br />
Odd behaver: I’m deftly smarter then I was originally, I have also developed an inexplicable knowledge of both computer science and pyromancy, I have only cast a few fire spells on purpose so far but have accidently shot gouts of flame out of my hands so often that I have taken to caring a fire extinguisher with me at all times. <br />
<br />
Subject L-02 Mona<br />
Hair: short blond hair done up with a bow<br />
Eyes: an unnatural lavender color, she also has two pupils per eye<br />
Face: round and youthful<br />
Breasts: A-cup<br />
Height: 5’11” <br />
Job: has forgone getting a job and taken it upon herself to do all the cooking and cleaning the house needs<br />
Sex: does not have a fixed partner, but always seems to find a bed to share every night, she has even shared mine on occasion. Seems to enjoy roleplay such as lactation play and babying <br />
Eggs: She also laid three eggs, Mona seemed to be the one to find the egg laying experience the most enjoyable of all of us  <br />
Other mutations: Mona has grown sharp fangs connected to venom sacks in the back of her thought, her venom isn’t strong enough to kill, but will paralyze. Also she seems to be developing an udder, for now it’s just a reddish aria under her bellybutton with four nipples <br />
Odd behaver: She’s acting unusually maternal, she also seems to have taken a dislike of clothing often wearing nothing more than an apron all day<br />
<br />
Subject L-03 Frankie<br />
Hair: shoulder length, blond hair<br />
Eyes: blue green <br />
Face: breathtakingly beautiful<br />
Breasts: B-cup<br />
Height: 6’1” <br />
Job: has picked up a job in a clothing store.<br />
Sex: has had a few dates with a couple of guys this month, will join in any sex aslong as shes invited and a penis is involved.<br />
Eggs: only laid one egg.  <br />
Other mutations: Frankie is much heavier then she looks, her bones are denser and her skin is thicker than any of the others, she has also gotten far stronger than the others <br />
Odd behaver: deftly the dimmest among us, I don’t want to be mean but she is basically a walking dumb-blond joke.<br />
<br />
Subject L-04 Drew<br />
Hair: blond hair cut short<br />
Eyes: dark blue eyes with two pupils per eye and pink silica <br />
Face: freckles and a tooth gap that doesn’t give her a lisp. Almost identical to Sophia<br />
Breasts: A-cup<br />
Height: 5’11” <br />
Job: has forgone getting a job and taken it upon herself to take care of all the animals on site, we have a stable full of horses for camp goers to rent and ride as well as some dogs and cats.<br />
Sex: most bezare of our ‘sisters’. Drew has taken up bestiality (gross). She has claimed one of the stallions, Charlie, as her mate. I don’t get it, but it seems to make her happy.<br />
Eggs: Drew laid three eggs<br />
Other mutations: Drew herself hasn’t developed any odd mutations, but I think she may have infected Charlie somehow, for he now has the same blue on pink eye coloration Drew has <br />
Odd behaver: Drew like me has developed a knack for magic, nature magic in her case. She has also taken to sleeping out in the barn most nights, prefers to go without shoes or most clothing really, and only regularly wares a pair of work overalls.<br />
<br />
Subject L-05 Sophie<br />
Hair: ass length, blond hair<br />
Eyes: dark blue eyes with pink silica<br />

Sex: has gone on many dates and one night hook ups around town<br />
Eggs: Sophia also laid three eggs<br />
Other mutations: Sophia has grown two half-foot long, retractable snake fangs filled with deadly venom. <br />
Odd behaver: Sophia is another of my ‘sisters’ that picked up some magic, mostly illusion and hypnotic spells. She is also very spiteful as it turns out. She is obsessed with her look, clothing and makeup and tends to hold her good looking dates over the others and tries to make us jealous.<br />
<br />
Subject L-06 Hanna<br />
Hair: brown hair in a short boyish cut.<br />
Eyes: unnatural dark purple, with six pupils per eye. <br />
Face: she looks like a total punk-rocker girl<br />
Breasts: A-cup<br />

Job: joined a band called smooch<br />
Sex: sleeps with her bandmates, both the guys and the girls, as well as hook ups at gigs<br />
Eggs: only laid one egg<br />
Other mutations: other than her eyes, Hana hasn’t developed any visible mutations yet. She can pick up radio and satellite signals in her mind, maybe even access the internet<br />
Odd behaver: Picked up some magic, mostly illusion and hypnotic spells like Sophia. Has developed an odd musical talent that the none of the rest of us nor the original Lily possessed. <br />
<br />

Other mutations: Rachel has developed spinnerets in the back of her thought, she can peruse about six feet of silk a day sofar. She also claims to have a spider sense<br />

<br />

Face: Hard set with freckles over the bridge of her nose<br />
Breasts: B-cup<br />

Sex: sleeps with the others primarily, is very sexually dominate.<br />
Eggs: only laid one egg<br />
Other mutations: other than her eyes, Hana hasn’t developed any visible mutations yet. She does have a heightened sense of smell.<br />
Odd behaver: has been less aggressive to the others since she started taking regular trips to the woods, no one knows what she does out there, I’ve asked Bernice and just got a grunt back. She still works out every day and is bulking up at a quick pace.<br />
<br />
Subject L-08 Clair<br />

Eggs: the only one to lay two eggs<br />
Other mutations: Like me, Clair has grown a foot long tail with a flowering tip containing a penis; hers is an inch longer than mine, whatever. Clair has also started lactating a little bit, it gets uncomfortable for her if she doesn’t milk herself often.<br />
Odd behaver: she has also come to know magic; hers revolves around healing so far. She has a habit of talking to herself.<br />
<br />

Eggs: like most of us, she laid three eggs<br />
Other mutations: Has grown a fully functional penis and balls above her vagina, she also puts out pheromones that drive the rest of us crazy with lust.  <br />
Odd behaver: she is super helpful, extremely organised and loyal. She also tends to forgo pants when she wants to relax, this usually results in sex rather quickly<br />
<br />
