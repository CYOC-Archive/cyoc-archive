<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I chose Gabe. He sat towards the back of the audience. Gabe was your typical nerd. Skinny, short, and really onto sci-fi, fantasy, and anime. To complete the cliché, he was incredibly smart. The one deviation was his short dirty blonde hair instead of the usual frizzy dark brown. He wasn&#39;t the typical person Brad hung out with, neither was he the type most people here knew. <br />
<br />
This of course brought up the question, how did he get invited? As embarrassing as this is to admit, we met Gabe because he had to tutor us. I say embarrassing because while we were older than Gabe and were supposed to be a year ahead of him in school, he had skipped a grade and we needed his help to keep up.<br />
<br />
However, it did lead to an unlikely friendship with him. Unfortunately, Brad had an image to maintain and didn&#39;t hang out with Gabe much in public. Most people thought his invite was out of obligation. <br />
<br />
Now he stood on stage with me. Gabe was dressed in a cheap wizard costumes, complete with purple robes, a fake beard, and a hat with stars on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Gabe, I  have to be honest with you. Your costume isn&#39;t as impressive as my last two volunteers.&quot; There was laughter from the audience. &quot;What do you say, should we give him a better one?&quot; This time the audience gave a thunderous cheer.<br />
<br />
I quickly conjured a hoop with a curtain and placed it center stage and had Gabe stand in the middle of it. &quot;First things first, loose the hat and the beard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it ties the costume together. &quot;  Gabe argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe buddy, that costume is held together by desperation. You&#39;ll be leaving here with a much better one, trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe reluctantly gave me his props, and I walked over to wear I had placed Jessica&#39;s Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader outfit. I picked it up and checked to see if all parts were accounted for. They were including, Jessica&#39;s bra and thong she had left behind. Approaching Gabe from behind, I told him, &quot;Close your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe obeyed and I placed the wadded up outfit in his hands. I quickly stepped outside of the hoop and lifted it up to about neck height. The curtain hid Gabe&#39;s body, and I gave the hoop a good shake for dramatic effect.<br />
<br />
Finally, I dropped the hoop revealing Gabe&#39;s new outfit. He wore the Dallas cowboy&#39;s cheerleader outfit, and now filled it out better than Jessica had. Gabe&#39;s new body was a bit more impressive in terms of boobs and butt, which made the outfit a bit tighter in those areas. Otherwise, it might as well have been Jessica&#39;s body from the neck down. The skimpy, tight clothing made it clear, Gabe was no longer a boy.<br />
<br />
The neck up however was still nerdy Gabe. In her now immaculate manicured hands was her former wizard robes. Seeing Gabe&#39;s head on that body caused everyone to laugh. <br />
<br />
Gabe peaked one of his eyes and looked down. &quot;What happened to me?&quot; She cried. <br />
<br />
&quot;An upgrade. Unfortunately, I feel your face doesn&#39;t fit the new look.&quot; I picked up a chair and placed it down. &quot;Have a seat, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Going off stage, I again conjured the props I needed before heading back. While doing this, I heard some wolf whistles and a few crude comments. Once I had returned, I found Gabe squirming in her seat, unsure how to cross her arms with her now larger chest.<br />
<br />
Once again, I approached from behind. &quot;Now to fix your face, I&#39;ve brought a mask.&quot; Again people laughed.<br />
<br />
Gabe just gave a quick, &quot;Hey!&quot; Before I placed the mask on her. The mask in question was a simple red box.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that? Comfortable? &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Her muffled voice responded. Her arms finally found a position under her breasts. Had she seen how she framed them for the audience she may had made a different decision but I could see how that might be more comfortable in this situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; I pretended to consider the problem. &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s a matter of balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I seriously doubt it.&quot; Gabe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can&#39;t know until we try, isn&#39;t that what the scientific method is about?&quot; Before he responded, I reached for the other prop I had brought, a pot full of daggers.  &quot;Tell me if this pinches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If what p-&quot; Gabe&#39;s question was cut off as a slid a dagger into the side on the box. Her body suddenly went limp as her arms dangled at her side and her hid listed towards the side I put the dagger in. There were a couple of gasps of shock from the audience. I didn&#39;t expect that when I vanished her head, but I guess I should have been more careful with my wish. I made a mental note of that for the future and pressed on with the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps too much weight in in one side.&quot; I proceeded to stab the other side to balance out the box. I continued this for a bit, making it a comedy routine of me trying to balance it out. <br />
<br />
Finally I placed the last dagger down the center from the top, and pulled off the front to show an empty box. The audience which had been silent while I went on now clapped for me. I replaced the front and quickly took out the daggers.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that was probably a mistake.&quot; I said. &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can try a different mask.&quot; As I removed the box, the audience once again applauded, some even giving me a standing ovation as Gabe&#39;s head was revealed. <br />
<br />
While the face was somewhat similar to Gabe in some ways, she now had an obvious feminine face. I made sure she was incredibly cute, with her dirty blonde hair framing her face in a Bob haircut. Her face had an attractive sweet innocence about it, which was contrasted by the sexy body she had.<br />
<br />
Gabe seemed unsure about why they were applauding. &quot;You know what Gabe, nevermind. I wouldn&#39;t dream of hiding those cute dimples you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe started to blush as a look of realization dawned on her face. She must have put the peices together and figured out what I had done. She was always smart like that.<br />
<br />
I overheard a few comments from the crowd and decided to remind them of a few things. &quot;You know, I wouldn&#39;t mind performing again at your birthday. When is that again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I turn 18 this summer.&quot; She said, with a new high pitch voice thay surprised her.<br />
<br />
&quot;This summer guys. Remember that.&quot; A few of the more enthusiastic guys sat down glum that they wouldn&#39;t be able to talk her into anything this night. Not without charges at lleast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until then, I say we should give Gabby and round of applause for volunteering. Please enjoy the rest of the show.&quot; I pointed at Jessica&#39;s former seat next to Brad. &quot;You can see better from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby took my suggestion and sat next to Brad who seemed a lot more willing to be seen in public with her all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, who&#39;s next?&quot;</p>
