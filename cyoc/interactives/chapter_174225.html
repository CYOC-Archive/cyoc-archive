<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A half hour later, Dan crawled back inside, completely exhausted and soaking wet. Kat had hosed him off before he came back inside and told him that dogs shake to dry off. He tried his best, but it didn&#39;t do much. Eventually Kat came back and dried him off with a towel after their Mom told her to dry him off. <br />
<br />
Although now he was dry, he was still quite cold. Dan could only look around the room for something to warm himself up with. Reluctantly there was only 1 option. With nothing else available, Dan crawled over and gkt into their dog Max&#39;s bed, which currently was empty. He curled up the best he could and tried to warm up a bit better. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but it was still better than the hardwood floor. Soon he was fast asleep, having decided to take a nap due to how tired he was from the &quot;walk&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dan awoke with a start, suddenly feeling something wet press against his ass. Max was standing behind him sniffing his butt. The cold wet nose sent a shiver throughout Dan&#39;s body. And the warm air from his breath was somehow making him horny. Before Dan could shove him away, Max climbed up over him and pushed down on his back, mounting him. <br />
<br />
Dan was horrified at what was happening, but was powerless to stop it in his current posture. He felt Max&#39;s cock press into his asshole as he started getting fucked. It hurt, as the thick cock slid in and out of his ass, forcefully widening it. What literally sealed the deal was when the knot slipped in. However, what was once pure agony, was slowly starting to feel a bit better as the cock was now deep enough that it could now rubbed up against his prostate consistently. Finally Max came, filling his ass up with cum. <br />
<br />
Max, having finished hopped off of Dan. Dan then tried to get away, but found out he was now stuck to Max by the knot still lodged in his ass. All he could do now was wait it out. 40 minutes later, the cock finally slipped from his ass. Dan let out a sigh of relief and slowly moved away from Max. But before he could even move off of the bed, max got up and laid down on top of him, pinning him down underneath his body. He didnt attempt to mate with him again, but was just sleeping with his new bitch. Unable to move, Dan reluctantly gave in and relaxed his struggle, curling up as the little spoon to his dog. <br />
<br />
For some reason, this position was much more relaxing than anything before, even when he was by himself. Max&#39;s warm fur kept him warm too, and the pet bed was not terribly difficult to get use to as it was of a high quality. A bit later he woke up and could hear Kat calling for him and Max. He responded by following Max, knowing if he didn&#39;t, she would definitely make his life worse. He could feel Max&#39;s cum still in his ass, and felt a bit sick just by knowing what it was. He swore to keep this to his grave if he could help it. What he didn&#39;t realize was that some remaining droplets of cum were still hanging down off of his tail. <br />
<br />
Kat instantly saw them, but didn&#39;t say a word. However she did change Dan without his notice. First, she softened his ass a bit, allowing for slightly larger objects to pass through it more easily now. Second, was that she made Dan&#39;s pee smell like a bitch&#39;s pee. And lastly was that she made his ass very sensitive. She fed her pets and left again. <br />
<br />
Dan, having no other option, lowered his head and licked up a mouthful of the wet dog food. It smelled rancid, but surprisingly didn&#39;t taste too terrible. If he didn&#39;t smell it, he could stomach it at least. The part he hated was how he had to lick his bowl clean, as the bowl still carried the aweful smell, but no longer had a taste to drown it out with. When his bowl was clean, Max came over and licked his face clean. In order to wash down the taste, Dan drank over half of the water in the water bowl too.<br />
<br />
After eating, the harsh reality that this would be his life from now on set in hard, causing Dan to just go back to the dog bed and try and sleep. But Max wasn&#39;t having it amd pinned him down underneath him again. Guessing what was about to happen, Dan struggled with all of his might but couldnt shake him off in time as the cock stabbed back inside of his ass. This time however, Dan let our an invoulentarry moan, feeling way more pleasure than the harsh pain this time. Now that he was feeling pretty good, Dan didn&#39;t struggle quite as much, and began enjoying the warm feeling that getting fucked in the ass by his dog was bringing him. By the time his dog came, Dan had been moving his ass in rhythem with Max&#39;s thrusting. A stupid grin was on his face as he came as well from his flacid dick. <br />
<br />
The joined pair laid down next to each other now, with Dan teasing the thought of accepting Max as his mate and becomming his bitch around im his mind. There wasn&#39;t really any downside to accepting the position, and since he would likely be seen as only a pet for the rest of his life, at least Max would be there to treat him like someone importaint to them. To the rest of the world, all he is seen as is just another dog. But to Max, he was special. Yep, Dan felt that being Max&#39;s Bitch was a whole lot better than being alone. Now that Dan had accepted this, his only regret was that he wouldn&#39;t be able to have his babies.</p>
