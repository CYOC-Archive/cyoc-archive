<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cadance was seated behind the curtains inside a cage where was a lot of different trinkets and objects laying on the floor. She was told to play with them as she saw fit the moment her mother would be awaken from the trance. After a minute of a two a thin layer of powder was blowed to Amanda&#39;s body and she was released from her trance as Lesily showed the crystal to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;...just a moment right there.&quot; Cadance continued from her trance ended and noticed that everyone had suddenly moved. &quot;Cadance. My sweet little baby pea. Where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you worry about your child ma&#39;am. You are the one living your last moments here. As requested I gave your daughter every tool and hid her so your presense wouldn&#39;t affect the end result.&quot; Lesily said as she leaned her whole body on Amanda. &quot;You see. At this very moment you are still existing, but at the same time your daughter had requested what to do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just absurd. Why are you letting my child even do this.&quot; Amanda hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh, calm down lady. If it were me I could snap you away at any moment. I am just curious to see how someone else would do this. Will they go slowly, do it in an instant, drain you or perhaps even do something more weird. Now it&#39;s up to you to see now if that raising made her grow a heart or not.&quot; Lesily chuckled and took steps backwards as Amanda had already gotten a little bit younger.<br />
<br />
Behind the curtain Cadance was able to see her mother and had already touched some of the odd trinkets on the floor, but not all of them. Amanda could see the crowd and tried to pry where her daughter was but couldn&#39;t notice that she was behind her back. The powder had made it so that she wouldn&#39;t able to see or hear Cadance.<br />
<br />
The now 30-year-old Amanda tried to act brave as to her everything begun to look weird. The gap between audience and the stage was getting wider as she approached the edge and the curtain behind her felt the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lesily. As this might be my final moments. Am I allowed to ask for my own request?&quot; Amanda pleaded as she crawled towards Lesily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that you mentioned it. I will allow the requests you make as long as they don&#39;t change the outcome which your own daugther chose to you. You can show the audience the person you really are, as I will make whatever you wish for with my hypnosis to a pseudoreality.&quot; Lesily eyeballed Amanda on the floor. &quot;As I said, it&#39;s up to your child if she wants to regress you or not since it&#39;s her request. So suck it up, stand up and whisper to my ear what is it you wish for. Just remember, every place, person and thing you interact with is just imagination and you can always ask for more.&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole stage was covered with white smog and the audience saw the middle of it changing to a street. Lesily had hypnotized every audience remember to see whatever Amanda saw in her own hypnosis. As Amanda stood up she noticed herself being on the floor of a park. A spectre appeared next to her and asked if she was okay.<br />
<br />
To Amanda she looked like a real person, but to the audience they saw a smoky ghost acting with her. Lesily walked near her and begun to pantomime a park bench under her. Lesily invited Amanda to sit next to her as she was still 30-year-old. Everyone was captivated to see how this small play would turnout to be like. Would Amanda become corrupted or would her brain handle the illusionary reality she was now inhabiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does everyone look so hazy?&quot; Amanda asked as she tried to look far away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they are illusions. They come to talk with you than other way around. If you think that you are somewhere else, like so, you are there with a blink of an eye.&quot; Lesily said as she took a cup of coffee from a table that had appeared around them. The park bench had transformed into a coffee house sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your own memory projected to you, right? You used to work here when you were 30-years-old?&quot; Lesily asked as she put the cup on the table. &quot;That there is your boss Willkins and that handsome man there is someone you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? How do you-?&quot; Amanda turned her head in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic...&quot; Lesily laughed and vanish from the seat as she walked next to Amanda. &quot;All of this is an illusion. Everyone is still here so don&#39;t get too invested on these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda wasn&#39;t sure what she meant by that as for her this was a normal workday. Amanda&#39;s mind was already being consumed by the old memories as she relived them. The audience was grasping their seats as they expected Cadance to pour salt on her mother&#39;s past. The miniature play was interesting and that was the only thing what Lesily asked for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Cadance. It&#39;s up to you act as my little sidekick. I go take a small break so have fun with my magical toys.&quot; Lesily said to Cadance as Lesily went further to the dark backstage.</p>
