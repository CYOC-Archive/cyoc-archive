<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you really think I&#39;m pregnant?&quot; Melissa Stovall asked Doctor Frances Twist with a shocked look on her face.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say you were for sure. I said the possibility exists,&quot; pointed out Moon Lake&#39;s licensed therapist and werecat. &quot;After all, by your own admission, you&#39;ve been under a lot of stress lately, so forgetting to do daily stuff, like taking your birth control pills, isn&#39;t a strike against you. Just a part of life.&quot;<br />
&quot;Martin and I have talked about having another child before, but not lately. First came Julie, then life seemed okay for awhile as we were raising her, until I discovered his infidelity and everything started going to pieces.&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides marriage counseling, family counseling, and individual counselling for yourself if needed, if necessary I&#39;ll be more than happy to individually counsel Julie as well. Although I certainly don&#39;t know all the details at this point, I think it&#39;s a safe bet that there might be more going on in her life than just trying to get through those awkward teenage years. Maybe everything going on between you and Martin is affecting her too. Julie wouldn&#39;t be the first child who wanted to lash out somehow,&quot; pointed out Frances.<br />
&quot;So what do I do?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
&quot;Whoever wants to see me about whatever, I can adjust my schedule accordingly,&quot; offered Frances. &quot;I can&#39;t promise to resolve everything for you overnight, but I&#39;m sure together, we can work it all out in time.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what about me and Alyssa Cooper?&quot; asked Melissa, thinking about the rival were-mermaid in her husband&#39;s life.<br />
&quot;Having not met the other woman, I&#39;m afraid at the moment that&#39;s between you and Martin. We never did more than just kiss and flirt,&quot; said Frances, in a more solemn tone of voice. &quot;Besides, you met Martin and were aware from the start that no matter what happened, I would always be with Samantha, so nothing serious never would of happened between us. But do you have any lesbian curiosity or tendencies?&quot;<br />
&quot;After you? I would of said no,&quot; admitted Melissa, looking at her friend with a smile on her face. &quot;Every one is curious at least once. I wondered, found out what I wanted to know, and moved on. In all honesty, I thought that was over and done with until she showed up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what changed?&quot; asked Frances, wondering if Melissa knew.<br />
&quot;I wish I knew for certain,&quot; confessed Melissa, as she slumped back into one of Frances&#39; patient chairs. &quot;The fact that I was being ignored by my own husband? That Martin was unfaithful? That someone other than him found me sexy and attractive? Well... there were other men in my life before him, but once Martin arrived, he was the only one in my heart. Even if I did get an offer from a would be suitor or someone wanting a quick swim in a different pond once I became a were-mermaid myself, I ignored them all feeling totally in love and committed to Martin.&quot;<br />
&quot;Other than me, were there ever any offers from another woman?&quot; wondered Frances.<br />
Melissa Stovall thought long and hard about that before answering. &quot;If there were, they went totally over my head unrecognized as such.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it seems that we have a lot to talk about. If you have the time, let me check with Rudy to make sure at least the rest of my morning is free, and then I&#39;ll fix us another pot of tea before we continue,&quot; offered Frances.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Frieda Knight had Office Assistant as her second period class. This enabled her to learn office and business skills while helping out in the front office of Moon Lake High School doing things like coordinate tardy notices and absentee slips, and other clerical duties.<br />
When the secretary asked Frieda to help run off copies of a flyer that would be passed out to everyone about the school agenda before it let out for the Christmas holidays, the young werepanthress found herself alone in the copy room.<br />
As the Xerox machine started doing its job, Frieda took advantage of the privacy and used the opportunity to compose and send out a text message on her cellphone.<br />
WILL BE HOSTING A SMALL GATHERING OF SOME FRIENDS AFTER SCHOOL TODAY. 2 + MYSELF.<br />
PLEASE PREPARE ACCORDINGLY. LIGHT SNACKS AND PRIVACY FOR DOING HOMEWORK REQUIRED.<br />
It was several minutes later and about halfway through her copying task before Frieda received a reply.<br />
ALL WILL BE AS REQUESTED. ANYTHING ELSE MADAME?<br />
Frieda smiled. No matter how many times she asked him otherwise, the family butler just wouldn&#39;t call Frieda by her first name. At least not while on duty.<br />
NO JEFFERY. HAVE THE CAR READY FOR PICK UP AT THE USUAL TIME. THANK YOU.<br />
It was just moments before Jeffery responded accordingly and Frieda put her cellphone up with no one the wiser as to what she did.<br />
<i>You better be careful where you swim Julie Stovall. You may think you have the social standing because your dad&#39;s the mayor, but you NEVER mess with a Knight!</i> she thought, before returning to the copying task at hand.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Alyssa Cooper laid in bed, stark naked, with the vibrating dildo still active in her pussy, when her hotel room phone rang.<br />
Hoping it was Melissa Stovall, but puzzled why her call wasn&#39;t coming through her cellphone, Alyssa anxiously answered it, surprised to hear the young voice on the other end.<br />
&quot;Miss Cooper?&quot; the male voice began. &quot;You may not remember me, but we met last night at the lake. I remember Julie mentioning your name, and since there&#39;s only one hotel in town...&quot;<br />
&quot;The were-otter with the great tongue?&quot; she asked, while turning the dildo off.<br />
&quot;Yes. My name is Brian Walker, and I was wondering if that offer you made me last night is still good?&quot;<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; said Alyssa with a smile, as she sat up. &quot;Just tell me when and where.&quot;<br />
&quot;You can choose the where, but anytime after 4 this afternoon, as long as I&#39;m home by 11 tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;How about the lake?&quot; wondered Alyssa, already picturing the &#39;lessons&#39; she would give him.<br />
&quot;Fine. A little after 4 okay? I&#39;m on foot,&quot; said Brian.<br />
&quot;What if I pick you up?&quot; offered Alyssa, wondering how were-otter cock tasted.<br />
&quot;From school?&quot; asked Brian in return, before they finalized their plans.<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s a date,&quot; said Alyssa happily, looking forward to a long bout of sex. After all, in Moon Lake, as long as your partner was an active were, there were no worries about having sex with a minor compared to laws in the rest of the world. &quot;By the way, what happened to Julie?&quot;<br />
&quot;She got away from the lake okay, but her folks still extended her grounding when she got home. She&#39;s unavailable now until at least Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; he explained, not mentioning breaking up with her or ratting Julie out at school today.<br />
&quot;Too bad,&quot; said Alyssa with genuine emotion. <i>If Melissa doesn&#39;t call me back before my hot date with Brian, I&#39;ll just have to den whatever Stovall&#39;s are at home tomorrow.</i><br />
<br />
As Brian Walker hung up his cellphone and hurried to his third period class, he couldn&#39;t help thinking what a great day this was turning out to be, provided he stayed away from Julie Stovall.<br />
He had successfully dumped the snooty, using bitch that morning; then let everyone know about her extended grounding.<br />
Now, after he finally figured out how to contact the mysterious Alyssa Cooper, Brian looked forward to an evening of hot sex with a devastatingly beautiful were-mermaid. <i>She said I have a great tongue. Can&#39;t wait to show her how good the rest of me is too.</i><br />
The only drawback to the whole day is that he had history with Julie Stovall fifth period, and Freshman lunch after his third period class. <i>As long as I can avoid her wrath, the rest of my day is golden,</i> Brian happily thought, entering his next classroom just before the tardy bell rang.<br />
Although they didn&#39;t know why, the fact there was a huge tent in Brian Walker&#39;s pants as he entered wasn&#39;t lost on a few of the were females, who knew he was now available.</p>
