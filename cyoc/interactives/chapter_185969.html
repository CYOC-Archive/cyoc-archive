<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry was still able to wear shorts and a polo shirt, which is what he probably would have worn on the helicopter trip anyhow. At five to 9 hotel reception rang to say that a driver was here to pick them up. Henry and Alicia brazenly walked out through reception arm in arm. If anyone thought it strange to see such a tall woman with a short pudgy man they didn’t say anything.<br />
<br />
Henry had chartered the helicopter for 6 hours. It was not just your standard one hour tour. They started with a flight to the big island where they landed and hiked to some spectacular waterfalls. Then there was lunch at a restaurant with breathtaking coastal views before a flight over the volcanoes including another landing. They finished with a tour over all the Hawaiian archipelago before being landed back at their resort at 4 pm. <br />
<br />
They decided to eat-in that evening but first took to bed and did what honeymooners do. Henry was actually turned on by Alicia’s Amazonian dimensions. Alicia confirmed that Mister Marvellous had lost some of his length but she wasn’t going to complain. She had experienced a wonderful day.<br />
<br />
Henry had once more perused the note that came with the doll after his snooze while Alicia had a bath. The recommendation was clearly to drink one sachet each day, supposedly bringing he and Alicia closer. But would it just complicate things further? <br />
<br />
There was the statement that the magic from each sachet would last 24 hours. If that was correct he guessed he would be back to his normal height when he woke tomorrow. However the next line was clearly a warning. ‘The effects of the previous sachet would linger until all the doll was consumed’. Did that mean he would only slowly regain his height if he did not take another sachet? Clearly the first sachet had given him a large enough dose of whatever it was to last for 24 hours. Logic told him it would wear out. Surely taking a second dose would just must things worse, re-flood his system with whatever chemical had done this to him and prolong the effects. The warning just didn’t make sense.<br />
<br />
Henry decided he would just throw out the rest of the doll into the garbage. He could live with being short for a day. He had still enjoyed today and he had the feeling Alicia had as well. They were here for 14 days. So what if the effects lingered? Surely by 14 days, at which point they would be returning home, he would have regained his height even if the effects lingered somewhat. They were just playing golf tomorrow morning with no real plans for the rest of the day. He had imagined lounging by one of the hotel pools during the afternoon, then dinner at a restaurant. Being short shouldn’t disrupt that too much. Anyway it was likely he would regrow somewhat if not completely by tomorrow morning anyway.<br />
<br />
But then there was the last sentence ‘The candy stick is a good one to start with as it will demonstrate how powerful this magic is’ Certainly the candy stick had demonstrated something powerful. Something beyond Henry’s experience. That last sentence once more threw a bit of doubt in Henry’s mind. He decided to discuss things with Alicia once she was out of the bath.<br />
….<br />
Alicia knew that brain power was not a particular strength of hers. When Henry explained his reasoning to her for throwing out the doll she just nodded and kept saying “That makes sense” In reality she had no idea. She just wanted to defer to Henry. He seemed so smart to her, he ran a huge company. If Henry said that the effects would probably wear off overnight then he was most likely correct, although she had to admits her gut was telling her to follow the directions on the note. She did mange to convince Henry that it might be safer just to lock the doll away somewhere rather than toss it into the garbage. Henry thought that was a good suggestion as that way he would retain evidence. The doll was put into the hotel safe.<br />
<br />
So after ordering room service Alicia spent time telling her friends via Facebook about their day (nothing about the magical height swap though) while Henry got an update from Simon on the company. <br />
<br />
They went to bed relatively early. Henry had taken a tablet which revitalised Mister Marvellous and gave Alicia an encore performance. By 10 pm both were asleep.</p>
