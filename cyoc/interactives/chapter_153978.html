<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Sofya took Fido off of Michael’s hands, she brought him in to the house. After trotting over to the couch, Fido laid  down on the floor of the living room.<br />
<br />
“I have do some cleaning up before company comes over” she said, looking down at her new pet. “Do you think you can be a good boy for a while?”<br />
<br />
Wanting to show enthusiasm, even if he didn’t really mean it, Fido barked twice as Sofya bent down to scratch him behind the ears. He began to stomp his foot and wag his tail. He loved being pet there. However, he noticed that his dick was beginning to slither out of his sheath, so he hoped that she’d stop doing it soon.<br />
<br />
“Good boy” Sofya said as she got back up. “I’ll be back in a bit.”<br />
<br />
Fido laid on the floor for a moment as he processed the situation he was in. He was stuck as a dog in the house of a girl whose father was a powerful wizard. She was a girl who forcibly tried to rape him as a human being. While he tried to be nice to her, as deep down he felt sorry for her, Freddy was already uncomfortable with the idea of posing as Sofya’s pet so that Michael could keep an eye on her with the bugs he planted throughout the house. Now, having his friends coming over without them knowing he was here was going to make this experience a thousand times worse than it already was. He only hoped that Michael knew what he was doing this time….and that he didn’t have to sleep outside in the yard again.<br />
<br />
Getting up, Fido trotted around as he inspected the house from his four legged position. Eerily, the house itself was quiet, so he couldn’t pick up on any unusual noises in his ears. The musty smell that hit him the first time he came in the house was all gone as well. It was hard to believe, but it was if the house had no odor. <br />
<br />
“Strange” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Fido trotted over to the kitchen as Sofya began to clean it. He noticed that there was a dog door on the floor leading out into the yard. <br />
<br />
“That might come in handy later if I need to make a quick escape” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Spotting Fido, Sofya briefly stopped cleaning the counters as she went down to scratch his head again. <br />
<br />
“Are you hungry, boy?” she asked. <br />
<br />
Fido was about to shake his head left and right, but Freddy decided against it. Instead, he barked once, hoping to indicate a no. When she got up, he thought she had listened to him. Instead, she got a plate with some pieces of turkey on it. <br />
<br />
“Until my dad can you give proper dog food” Sofya said as she laid down the plate in front of him “you can have some of this. I don’t think it’s bad for dogs. It’s just sliced pieces of turkey meat from the dinner my dad and I ate when we first got here.”<br />
<br />
Fido sniffed the turkey, thinking it was laced with some sort of poison or other magical potion. Not noticing anything peculiar about it, Fido hesitantly stuck has tongue out to lick the meat. Since it tasted fine to him, he began to chow down on it and ate up the whole plates worth. When it was gone, he licked it clean with his tongue as Sofya bent down to take it from him.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you liked it” Sofya said as she got up to put the plate to the sink.<br />
<br />
“I’d much prefer to eat that over dog food any day of the week” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Seeing that Sofya was ignoring him, Fido decided to continue moving. He got up and roamed about the house. He looked into the dining room and trotted up to a chair by the table. With his teeth, he bit into the side of the seat, pulled it out and made an effort to swing it around so he could hop up onto it. Freddy remembered when he saw his reflection in the mirror last night that he was a dog man. He wondered if that was still true when he looked at it in his dog form. <br />
<br />
Fido was in for a surprise when he got up on his hind legs to take a peek at his reflection in the mirror. Presented before him was his human self. When the dog wiggled unsteadily on the chair, a mirror image of Freddy did the same. While Fido was panting, Freddy kept his tongue firmly in his open mouth. <br />
<br />
“Weird” Freddy thought to himself, before he lost balance. <br />
<br />
Soon, Fido fell onto the floor on all fours and made a thud while doing so. <br />
<br />
“What was that?” Sofya could be heard from the kitchen asking aloud. <br />
<br />
Sofya made her way into the dining room to see Fido beside a chair that had been turned slightly outwards.<br />
<br />
“How did they chair get out of place like that?” she asked as she pushed it back into the table. “Bad dog! Don’t bite the furniture!”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered in reaction to her scolding him, as Sofya noticed his leash was still attached to his collar. <br />
<br />
“I can undo the leash for now, but I’m leaving the collar on in case someone comes to claim you.”<br />
<br />
Sofya detached the leash and took it in one hand as she dragged Fido by the collar with the other. He whimpered loudly as she led him out of the dining room. She left let go and left him by the foot of the stairs as she went back into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“You be a good boy. Don’t cause anymore trouble. Company will be here any minute.”<br />
<br />
Sofya went back to cleaning in the kitchen as Fido looked up the stairs. It looked much bigger from where he stood now. Not knowing where else to go, Fido made his way up the steps and onto the second floor. Turning around, Fido attempted to open the bathroom door, but was having a hard time moving the door knob. Then, he attempted to open the door to Sofya’s room, which proved much easier to do.<br />
<br />
When he successfully moved the knob with his paws, the door swung open to reveal her pink and purple bedroom. As a dog, Fido could smell an overwhelming amount of fancy perfumes and scented candles with his nose that made him cough out loud. <br />
<br />
“Woah” Freddy thought to himself as he tried to close the door again with his snout. “That’s like walking through the perfume store at the mall.”<br />
<br />
Fido could only get it closed part way before he gave up and just decided to walk away. From there, Freddy turned to look at the dimly lid corridor that led to Sofya’s father’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
“The wizard’s room” Freddy thought to himself as Fido trotted over to take a look a it. <br />
<br />
Before Fido could reach the door, he could hear a voice calling to him. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” a voice called to him.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” Freddy thought to himself as Fido cocked his head. <br />
<br />
“Freddy. Don’t come in here.”<br />
<br />
“Who said that?”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as he looked around, confused over where the source of this voice was coming from.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” the voice continued. “Don’t come in here. Don’t come in here if you wish to remain human.”<br />
<br />
Freaking out, Fido whimpered and barked as he ran away quickly and headed back down the stairs. At the bottom of them, Sofya could hear the dog panic as she left the kitchen to see him looking worried. Leaning down, Sofya began to rub Fido’s back.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, boy?” Sofya asked with concern in her voice. “Does this old house give you the creeps?”<br />
<br />
Fido whined and then barked twice. <br />
<br />
“Me too” Sofya replied as she got up to go back into the kitchen. “This was a dumb place for my father to choose to move into. I told him so, but he never listens to me on things like this.”<br />
<br />
Fido stared at her before she walked into the kitchen to continue cleaning. Noticing she was caught up in her chores, Fido decided to head back into the living room to lie down in his spot by the side of the couch.<br />
<br />
“I wonder where Michael hid all those bugs?” Freddy thought to himself. “I know he put one in the kitchen, but I didn’t see where else he hid them. I hope he picked some good hiding spots.”<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to him, the five bugs planted throughout the house briefly lit up to indicate that Michael was officially listening in. Before Freddy could ponder this further, he heard the door bell ring and a loud knocking on the door. Fido barked as he got up and ran in to the kitchen to get Sofya.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get it!” Sofya yelled as she ran past Fido to head to the front of the house.<br />
<br />
Fido trotted behind her and was greeted with an unwanted sight when she opened the front door. <br />
<br />
“Hey Sofya!” Daniel, the track and field captain exclaimed, as the other boys in his group walked past him to enter the house. <br />
<br />
“Hi boys” Sofya said with a twinkle in her eyes. <br />
<br />
This stopped the boys cold as they all turned back and stared at her.<br />
<br />
“Hi Sofya” the boys said in unison. <br />
<br />
“Come on in and have a seat on the couch. If it’s too tight for the six of you, then some of you can sit on the chairs. Just be careful, they are a bit delicate”<br />
<br />
The boys nodded as they went in to take a seat. They all couldn&#39;t fit on the couch, as Sofya had suspected, so five of them squeezed onto it as one boy sat by himself. As they sat, Freddy began recognize them. One of them was his teammate, Duane, who sat in a separate chair. The other boys, squished together on the couch, were from other sports teams. Three of them played football, while one of them played baseball in the spring. As his friends sat down, Fido noticed Daniel as he stood in the entryway to the house while Sofya looked at him curiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Freddy thought to himself. &quot;The worst possible person to be here right now. Great. This is going to be a wonderful evening. Wow, I&#39;m starting to sound like Michael.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you coming in?” Sofya asked Daniel, using that twinkle in her eye to lower his inhibitions. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, in a second” Daniel replied. “I’m just taking it all in, you know. This was a real piece of shit dump before and it’s amazing how anyone could have salvaged it. I thought they were gonna knock this old place down and build one of those mega mansions.”<br />
<br />
“I kinda wish they did” Sofya confessed, trying to get Daniel into the house as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Although the rain had already let up by the time the boys left to head to her house, Sofya still felt uncomfortable standing in the entryway for this long while company was inside. She wanted to get back in to entertain her guests. She wanted Daniel to come inside already. <br />
<br />
“What is he doing?” Sofya thought to herself, confused as to why Daniel wasn’t following her instructions. <br />
<br />
“I mean” Daniel continued “the place still looks like a dump, but hopefully you guys did some work inside that makes it halfway decent.”<br />
<br />
“If you come inside, I can show you the work that was done on it.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. Maybe not. I don’t…”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, man!” Duane, his teammate and Freddy’s friend, called to him from inside the living room. “What are you, man, a chicken?”<br />
<br />
The boys in the living room laughed as Daniel began to blush at this embarrassing situation he was in. Sofya giggled too as she looked to Duane before she turned back to look at Daniel.<br />
<br />
“Well?” she asked. “Is Duane right? Are you a big chicken?”<br />
<br />
“Nah, man” Daniel responded as she dismissed her with his hand and walked inside. “I just don’t want this old piece of crap to fall on me, that’s all. I don’t want to have to ask my dad to hire an attorney to sue you for injuries I&#39;ve sustained while visiting here. This place doesn’t look like it’s all that safe.”<br />
<br />
“I think it’s just that you’re scared!” Duane yelled. <br />
<br />
The boys laughed again as Fido got in on the fun by barking happily. Sofya giggled as she closed the door behind Daniel. <br />
<br />
“Hey, where did that dog come from?” Daniel asked as he walked over to look at it. <br />
<br />
“Uh oh” Freddy thought to himself, looking up at the captain of his team nervously.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Sofya replied, as she and the other boys looked down at the dog on the floor in front of them.<br />
<br />
Fido started to get stiff and shake nervously as the eyes of the entire room were on him. This evening was already off to a bad start.<br />
<br />
While this was going on……</p>
