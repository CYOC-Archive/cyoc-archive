<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Look, guys…” Mark held up his hands and backed away from the devils. “I know that there’s a lot of Paradox coming my way, but, uh, do you really have to drag me to Hell?”<br />
<br />
“Drag you to Hell?” Julius blinked. “Oh. Of course not. That won’t be necessary.”<br />
<br />
“Oh thank, uh, whoever’s in charge down there.” Mark nodded. “So, um, am I good to go? This is, like, just a warning?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Kornelius smiled. “I mean yes, but no. We didn’t come here for you.”<br />
<br />
Mark sighed. “That’s great to hear.”<br />
<br />
“We came for her.” Julius pointed.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Everyone’s eyes shot to Sophia.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I sense confusion.” Kornelius smiled. “Paradox is coming, yes, but unfortunately Sebastian has died and therefore defaulted on his contracts with us. We are here to enact the will of the Auditor and claim one soul: Sophia, the original Book owner.”<br />
<br />
There was silence for a moment. Sophia couldn’t believe what she was hearing. There was simply no way Sebastian would be that stupid. She didn’t make him stupid, she made him to protect her. Everything had just spiraled out of control after that.<br />
<br />
“But I didn’t do anything!” Sophia felt tears well up against her will. “He was responsible for all of it!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, and you summoned him. Ergo…,” Julius clicked his pen. “You are the one his loans defaulted on. Come along dear.”<br />
<br />
Sophia sprang to her feet and sprinted for the door.<br />
<br />
Julius waved a casual hand and spiked chains sprang from the fireplace, wrapping themselves around her arms and legs and throat. She struggled, feeling something hot begin to course through her veins. She felt her body pulse and her muscles began to tense.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing to me?” Sophia shook her head as another hot pulse filled her, causing her to pant.<br />
<br />
The devil grinned and walked forward to run a clawed finger across her cheek and down her chest, easily tearing the fabric of her shirt. “More fun to show than tell, my pet.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos stepped forward as though to help, but stopped as Kornelius waggled a finger, his eyebrow raised. “Ah, ah, ah. I don’t recommend interfering unless you want to join her.”<br />
<br />
Sophia’s muscles bulged bigger, harder, and her dress ripped. She started to struggle and convulse, pulses coming quicker now. Her spine popped as she grew taller, her shoulders cracked as she grew wider. Another pulse, hot, heady and she moaned, licking her lips as she felt her muscles flex and pulse, aches and incredible relief alternating as they grew.<br />
<br />
Her skin started to redden. At first she thought it was from the heat in the room—it  was sweltering, and sweat was pouring down her body—but then she saw the scales. Her skin was thickening, becoming a crimson hide, warts and spines growing from her beautiful skin.<br />
<br />
She screamed, but it was deep and bellowing, and more like a roar. Her gums began to ache and bleed, teeth clattering to the floor as growing fangs replaced them in her mouth. A pair of sabreteeth surged down past her chin, dripping with thick, steaming drool.<br />
<br />
Her hair stiffened and bristled, falling off in clumps from the side of her head. Thick tufts of fur grew and extended down to the base of her spine becoming a wild mane. She hissed as her spine popped out, one vertebra at a time, the pain and relief warring in her, making her clit stiffen in unexpected arousal. Sophia barely had time to process what that meant when her tail unfurled fully, a bony spike at its tip.<br />
<br />
Still the heat filled her, pulsed inside her, filling up her head with rage and carnal lust. It made her want to scream, to shout, to fuck. Her tongue, long and serpentine, licked her reptilian lips, yellow-green eyes thinning to slits as arousal filled her. To fuck. Her breasts, almost invisible now against the scales and muscle that wrapped itself in cords around her torso, disappeared, all body fat melting away.<br />
<br />
She needed to fuck! She bucked her hips and her clit began to throb and extend, blood-red and shimmering in her own juices. She felt a dull ache in her abdomen and then her ovaries plopped out into heavy sacks of hide. The spongy tissue firmed and compacted, becoming tighter, churning something new side of them. She bucked again and her clit flared into an angrily throbbing cockhead, which was pushed forward by a long shaft with thick veins snaking along its length.<br />
<br />
Sophia bellowed, all thoughts overtaken by the need for release. Mark sprang to her side, screaming and trying to wrench the chains free. Julius flicked a finger and Mark flew away, smacking into a wall, sending books tumbling to the floor and following them down with a thud.<br />
<br />
Kornelius walked up behind her, tail lazily swinging up to caress her balls as he stared up into her panicked eyes under a thickening brow. “There, there. Just let it all out.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Julius hissed happily, tail wrapping around her throbbing length. “Let Sophia go. Become Androclus.”<br />
<br />
Sophia tried to struggle, one last time, hating the thing she’d become, her bones popping in her face, becoming brutish and bestial as wicked-looking horns extended from the back of her head. Each pop squeezed her brain and all conscious thought towards the last place the heat was pulsing: her magnificent cock.<br />
<br />
He-no, she, shook her head. Magnificent cock? And it was glorious. A meaty spire that would put all other demons to shame. Thick drops of pre gushed from its tip. Andro-phia could only imagine how good it would feel putting it to use. He moaned as the tails writhed along his new length. He had to hold on or he’d…He bucked into the tails, all resolve crumbling as pleasure blinded him and he…he…<br />
<br />
Androclus bellowed and came, molten hot seed shooting across the room towards Trog, who barely avoided the splatter as it sizzled on the wooden floor.<br />
<br />
“Better not touch that.” Kornelius grinned. “Don’t want anything bad happening to my favorite mortal.”<br />
<br />
Julius placed a collar and leash around their new pet and the chains retracted, pulling Androclus towards the fiery portal. The pit fiend growled and flexed as it approached the hearth, and giant leathery wings burst from its back. It stretched its neck and unfurled its wings to their full impressive length before pulling on its monstrous, hardening cock once more with a clawed hand. It stepped forward into the portal without another backwards glance and disappeared.<br />
<br />
Kornelius blew Xarxos a kiss and then he and Julius followed the new demon into Hell. The portal closed behind them in a whoosh of flame and smoke. The fireplace was no longer burning.<br />
<br />
Mark stared at the empty fireplace, blinking. “What just happened?”<br />
<br />
“Sophia was dragged to Hell.” Xarxos said, sharing a horrified look with Rok.<br />
<br />
“Who?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
Rusty’s heads were staring at Xarxos as though he were mad. Trog stumbled towards a nearby recliner looking overheated, exhausted, and confused.<br />
<br />
“Reality Audit.” Xarxos explained through gritted teeth. “Someone we know is gone now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Mark nodded. “That sucks.”<br />
<br />
Xarxos swallowed. “Yes.”<br />
<br />
“So, I suppose that’s Paradox dealt with.” Rusty said. <br />
<br />
“I was so worried, I remember that much.” Mark wiped sweat from his body. “Look at me! Cold sweat! Ow!” Mark rubbed the back of his head and looked at the ruined bookshelf behind him. “Weird.”<br />
<br />
“We got off lucky.” Xarxos said.<br />
<br />
“Not all of us,” Rok said, his eyes trained on Mark.<br />
<br />
The minotaur opened his mouth to tell them to drop the paperwork when the ground began to shake, throwing everyone to the floor.</p>
