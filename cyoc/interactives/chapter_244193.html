<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was about to edit it, perhaps to make the sentence more specific or to change the outcome, but before he could do so, a car cut in front of him.<br />
<br />
Seeing the danger he was almost in, Jack decided to put down his phone and drive carefully. He didn&#39;t want any accidents, especially not with all six of his children in the van. He focused on the road, his eyes scanning the surroundings as he navigated through the traffic. After a while, they finally arrived home. Jack&#39;s wife, Helen, happily welcomed them, smiling as she saw the children sleeping in their seats.<br />
<br />
After Jack got out of the van, the two proceeded to open the van and carefully carry all of their children one by one. After changing their clothes, they carefully left the sleepy kids in their room, and the two parents began to organize and clean up the house. Having finished cleaning, Helen decided to head to the kitchen to prepare dinner. But before she could, she noticed Jack had left a new phone. Helen picked it up and turned it on, and found the app. While trying to figure out what it was, she generated a sentence:<br />
<br />
&quot;Helen was about to prepare dinner for her six toddler sons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing this made Helen reflect. While for any parent, having six children would be too much, for Helen it wasn&#39;t. Helen loved children very much, especially babies, and wouldn&#39;t even mind if she had one or more. Although sometimes she did wish they were girls so they wouldn&#39;t be so loud and mischievous.<br />
<br />
So out of pure curiosity, Helen began editing the sentence until it was different:<br />
&quot;Helen was about to prepare dinner for her ten baby daughters”.<br />
<br />
Immediately, reality changed. Helen noticed that all baby items had multiplied considerably and were now more colorful and girlish. Not only that, all the family photos had been altered, and instead of their six children, there were now ten. And the most notable thing of all is that their children were now baby girls.<br />
<br />
Helen was amazed by what this phone could do, but instead of telling Jack about it, she decided not to mention it to him for the time being.<br />
<br />
It was then that Helen began using her phone to make some improvements. One of those changes was to make their house considerably larger, almost turning it into a mansion. Another change was to make them quite wealthy, almost millionaires. Lastly, Helen decided to make all the changes permanent and ensure everyone&#39;s memories were consistent with the new reality. This way, everyone would think that this was how things had always been, except Helen herself. In Jane&#39;s case, although she would think she was always a girl, she would still remember the phone and her life as an adult. After this change, Helen hid the phone in some room in a secret place that only she knew about.<br />
<br />
Some time passed, and Jane finally began to wake up. When she finally awoke, she realized that several things had changed while she slept.<br />
<br />
She was now in a what seemed to be a huge nursery. The entire place was colorful, with lots of pastel colors and multiple drawings on the walls. Not to mention that there was everything that someone needed to care for a baby: cribs, toys, changing tables, baby closets, small shelves full of children&#39;s books, painting tables, rocking horses, baby bouncers, baby walkers, etc.<br />
<br />
Her brothers were there with her, but there weren&#39;t five of them anymore, but nine. Plus, both she and her new sisters were even younger than before, barely 1-year-old. And all of them were dressed in colorful baby clothes. In Jane&#39;s case, she wore a yellow floral romper.<br />
<br />
Right now, all of her sisters were doing different things: four of them were playing with toys, one was coloring with crayons, one was crawling all over the room, one was in one of the baby walkers, one was in one of the baby bouncers, and another was sleeping on the fluffy floor while sucking her thumb and hugging a stuffed animal.<br />
<br />
Jane began to wonder if one of her parents was responsible of all this. If so, she had to find that phone quickly. Maybe her memories were different now, but she still knew she wasn&#39;t a 1-year-old but an adult.<br />
<br />
So Jane proceeded to crawl toward the nursery door. But the further she went, the more distracted she became by the toys and activities in the room.<br />
<br />
Soon, she stopped and began to wonder if maybe she could play for a while and look for her phone later. All her sisters seemed to be having fun, so what if she joined in the fun too?</p>
