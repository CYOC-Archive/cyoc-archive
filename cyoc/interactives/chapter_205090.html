<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Izzy saw a strangely normal looking man. He didn’t look young, but he didn’t look old. His face was fairly youthful, but his hair was greying at the edges. It was an odd sight, but he was a risk regardless.<br />
From what Izzy could tell, the cell he was being kept in had a large glass panel separating her from him,<br />
<br />
“Y’know, the panel doesn’t do a lot,” he said, “it just gets in the way if you ask me,”<br />
“Who are you?” Izzy asked, ignoring him,<br />
“Careful not to be too disrespectful, you saw what happens when you don’t play nice,” he reminded. Izzy remembered about Agent West, she took another breath,<br />
“I apologise, Mr…” she said, hoping to get a name out of him,<br />
“I really don’t know my name. Perhaps I never had one… but I did have an acquaintance who called John… John Dean, perhaps?”<br />
“John Doe?” Izzy asked,<br />
“That was it,” he said, chuckling to himself, “I think I like John Dean… that friend was never that bright,” he stated, “you on the other hand, I can tell you’re intelligent,”<br />
“What makes you say that?” Izzy asked, playing along with his games,<br />
“Well, something about the way you’re talking to me. I can just feel how smart you are,”<br />
“Is that so,” Izzy said, crossing her arms,<br />
“Indeed,” he said. He stood up from the chair he was seated on, “how about we get rid of this panel?”<br />
“As long as you won’t do anything to me… unprovoked… then sure,”<br />
“Deal,” he said.<br />
<br />
Izzy looked at one of the cameras and nodded her head. After a few seconds, the glass panel started to ascend into the ceiling, giving both Izzy and John Dean a real view of each other.<br />
“So what’s your trade?”<br />
“Excuse me?” Izzy replied,<br />
“Your trade for that ‘Ms West’, her body back?”<br />
“Ah,” Izzy said. She looked at her feet, taking a breath as she did, “I suppose we could negotiate a reduced sentence,” Izzy said, less asking, more stating,<br />
“Well…” John Dean started, “how about we agree on no sentence for me. I think I understand this place enough to say that it’s not going to be the usual imprisonment kind of deal, a little more… difficult,”<br />
“Yes, that would seem to be the case,” Izzy said, once again playing along with him,<br />
“Good. Well how about this,” he started, “I fix your friend and you let me go with no strings attached,”<br />
<br />
Izzy couldn’t help but chuckle, “Mr Dean, I’m afraid that option is really off the table, and that’s not up to me,”<br />
“Oh, of course it’s up to you,” he said, “you see, if you don’t take this offer, then it’s just going to get a little more… difficult,”<br />
“You like that, don’t you,” Izzy stated,<br />
“Huh?” John replied, smirking,<br />
“The ‘difficult’ part. You like things to be simple, don’t you,”<br />
John smirked harder, “indeed I do,” he said, “I prefer when I get what I want. And trust me, when I want something, I get it…”<br />
“What about when you don’t?”<br />
“No,” he said blankly, “I get it. The only people who lose are the ones who think they can win,”<br />
“Is that so,”<br />
“Yes,” he said, “now let me change my offer. You let me go, no strings attached. I fix your friend Miss West… and you remain unchanged,”<br />
“Unchanged? Me?” Izzy said, looking a little frustrated,<br />
“You see, my power really is limitless,” he started, “I get what I want, because I have the power to get everything,”<br />
“So why don’t you just leave?”<br />
“Because there’s no fun in just leaving, is there?”<br />
<br />
“Look, Mr Dean, I don’t know the limits of what my organisation will allow me to do. I understand that you are a powerful individual, and I also understand that if it were up to me, I would have let you go,” Izzy said, keeping some parts of the truth to herself, “but when it all comes down to it, we both have to follow a set of rules to preserve a semblance of control,”<br />
“Very intelligent,” John said.<br />
<br />
Both stopped, standing in silence. John Dean was thinking, perhaps about his offer… or perhaps on the best way to escape. But Izzy knew to not aggravate him. Her main goal was to negotiate fixing Caroline.<br />
<br />
“Here,” John started, “how about this. I return Miss West to a… manageable state. I allow you to keep me in captivity for the next four days, and I have the privilege to change you,”<br />
“Change me?”<br />
“This is the best offer you’re gonna receive, I’d take it if I were you,”<br />
Izzy stopped for a moment, contemplating the offer. It was better than she expected to get… but that last part. She had to take it.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” she said, “but I have only one condition,” she said,<br />
“Go on,” he said,<br />
“You may not tamper with my mind or my intelligence. I know you keep on mentioning it, but this deal will not include me becoming some brainless bimbo!”<br />
John burst into laughter, almost beginning to cry as he laughed so hard,<br />
“Of course I’m not going to mess with you head!” He cried, “that intelligence of yours is a gift, to waste it on a pointless fantasy, that’d be a funnier joke than anything I’ve ever done!”<br />
“So that’s it?” She asked, “that’s the deal done,”<br />
“Yes,” he said, finally dying down from his laughter, “the deal is made. You may keep me here for four days, I’ll answer anything you ask me,”<br />
“Good,” Izzy said, she turned around to leave, but stopped herself. She turned back to John, “I appreciate your cooperation,”<br />
He smirked,<br />
“You too,”<br />
<br />
Izzy suddenly felt a tingling feeling on her chest. It was uncomfortable, yet oddly pleasurable. She looked down and was met with an unfamiliar cleavage in her top,<br />
“My breasts…” she said,<br />
“Indeed,” John replied, “you know, my mistress always loved a large pair of breasts,”<br />
“Right…” Izzy said grabbing her breasts as they grew, “this Mistress… did she have larger breasts?”<br />
“Of course she did!” John said, “she loved to change them whenever or wherever, it would give her so much joy to watch them grow!” He said,<br />
“Interesting,” Izzy said. She looked down at her chest. Her bra was small, already straining against her larger, fuller breasts.<br />
“Don’t expect them to be small, my friend. When I say she liked them big… I mean big,” he said, smiling ear to ear. <br />
Izzy found it hard to really react to the comment when bra was digging into her back as much as it was. Before too long, she felt the strap snap! Her breasts fell unsupported. Her back was hurting in a different way from the increased weight. They were getting to a larger size, approaching a ridiculous size! She didn’t know how to support herself. She wanted to stay during the entire expansion, but she was beginning to feel light-headed,<br />
“Open the door!” She said, turning away from John. A few seconds later she heard the door unlocking itself, opening. She quickly jumped inside and watched as it closed back up. John looked at her, waving as she disappeared. For some reason, she awkwardly smiled back at him… she didn’t have any reason to do that, but her light-headed feeling was getting more and more unbearable.<br />
Had he done something to her? To her mind!?<br />
<br />
She couldn’t think straight… she looked down and saw her breasts, almost the size of watermelons, supported only by her arm underneath them.<br />
Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, the second door opened up, revealing a number of doctors waiting for her. Before she could even say anything however, her vision started to blur.<br />
She could see the faint outline of a familiar face, James…<br />
<br />
Her vision went black. She passed out</p>
