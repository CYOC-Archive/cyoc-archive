<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was deeply sleeping when he felt something wet moving through his legs.<br />
&quot;Oh no! I did it again!&quot; He shouted as he woke up at the moment. He saw how his piss was flowing from his penis, he was completely embarrassed. But, he realized something more important than his bladder control. He was lying over a metal laboratory bed and tied to it by ropes on his wrists and ankles. Also, he was completely naked and it looks like someone had shaved his beard.<br />
&quot;What?!! Where I am?!! Help!! Help!! Someone help me!!&quot; He cried but nobody could be seen around. He was completely alone in that room. It was filled with medical instruments, weird machines and a ton of light above him. In two of his four white walls were some kind of mirrors that Mark assumed, as he knew from movies and tv-shows, they were windows where some people, maybe scientist or doctors could be watching him right now.<br />
At first, he thought he was having a nightmare, that he was on a bad dream even since he entered in Raul&#39;s house. He was wishing it was what was happening and as his piss was flowing from his dick some tears did the same on his face.<br />
A few minutes after he woke up, the only door in the room opened.Mark tried to see what was there, but he can see only a dark corridor whit a subtle red light over it. Some seconds later, a group of men began to enter the room, almost all of them wearing lab coats, a few wearing suits and a couple with some kind of radioactive protection suit. Between them, a kid maybe his same age was walking, he was just wearing a diaper.<br />
&quot;The subject&#39;s awakened.&quot; A man in lab coat said. &quot;That&#39;s good news, mr. Vanderbilt. We can start our testings with both test subjects instead of just one.&quot;<br />
The man he was talking, an elder wearing a fancy and old-fashioned suit, just nodded.<br />
&quot;Ok. Prepare the equipment.&quot; Another man in lab coat said. &quot;The counsel can take their place on the next room. Child treatment team, bring mr. Adams to his position and led mr... Peterson? Yeah, Mark Peterson to take his own.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?! Who are you?!!&quot; Mark shouted but nobody paid him any attention. &quot;I won&#39;t do anything if I don&#39;t get some answers!&quot;<br />
&quot;Shh..&quot; The other kid said as he walked right next to him. &quot;Don&#39;t make them angry and just follow the instructions.&quot;<br />
The boy walked to a weird chair which was designed to make him to stretch his limbs. Mark noted how the kid had big feet like him and his diaper was too big that it was covering half of his belly buttom. One man in radioactive protection suit begin to measure his body as the other one untied Mark.<br />
&quot;Follow me.&quot; The man said to Mark who stopped shouting and walked behind the man to another chair. &quot;Sit there.&quot; He said and then he began to measure him too. Meanwhile, the people with lab coats took their positions between all the machines in the room, making them to run and setting some data on them. A few come close to Mark and the other boy in order to activate the machines under their chairs. Then, a voice coming from a loudspeaker in a corner begin to talk.<br />
&quot;Area: minor effects. Division: 2. Test subjects: Test subject 1: Jake Adams. Status: Second testing. Test subject 2: Mark Peterson. Status: First testing. Testing in process: Body functions. Previous researchs...&quot;<br />
The voice kept talking but he begins to say too much technical things that Mark lost the track.<br />
&quot;Are you Jake Adams?&quot; He asked to the kid next to him.<br />
&quot;Yes. I assume you&#39;re Mark, right?&quot; Jake said and Mark nodded. &quot;Are you new here?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d awakened a few minutes ago.&quot; Mark said. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Where are we?&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;re on testings for male enhancement research. This lab is underground below my hometown, Bucecea, Romania. My father ask me to participate in this project, but after the first test I&#39;m not sure if I want to stay here.&quot; Jake said.<br />
&quot;Your father is around here?&quot; Mark asked him.<br />
&quot;Yes. He is one of the men with suits who were to the next room.&quot; Jake said. &quot;He&#39;s mr. Vanderbilt right hand.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who is mr. Vanderbilt?&quot; Mark asked. &quot;Is he the one with the old-fashioned suit?&quot;<br />
Jake nodded and tried to say something but at that moment, the speaker said. &quot;Start the process... Now.&quot;<br />
A sudden electric shock shook the boys. It wasn&#39;t too painful but it was very uncomfortable. Mark firmly grabbed the chair with his hands but his feet were moving without control. He was too distracted by the shock that he didn&#39;t feel he was pissing again. When it began to flow, the scientists stopped the process.<br />
&quot;We forgot the diaper for test subject 2.&quot; A man in lab coat said. &quot;Sorry, mr. Vanderbilt. We&#39;ll amend this in a second and continue the testing.&quot;<br />
A man in radioactive suit put a diaper on Mark who was stunned by the shocks. He cleaned the mess Mark had made and then the scientist reactivated the machines. Mark diapers was as big as Jack&#39;s one but he didn&#39;t care about it now. He was feeling too much arousal by the electric stimulations that he was happy he hadn&#39;t get erect before they put him the diaper.<br />
He can feel his dick pissing again and he assumed that was part of the testing they were making on him. He was getting acustomed to do it, but not to what was coming. His guts were shaking in him and he knew that could mean just one thing. Although he was wearing a diaper he didn&#39;t want that those people saw him pooping, so he tried to contain his impulse to do it, but besides of his efforts it was useless.<br />
&quot;At least, be silent.&quot; He said to himself, but what came from him was a very loud and strident fart. It lasted almost a minute and Mark can&#39;t be more embarrassed.<br />
&quot;Test subject 2 has succeed.&quot; A man in lab coat said. A few seconds later, Jack did the same. &quot;Test subject 1 has succeed. We can finish this process. Begin phase two.&quot;<br />
&quot;There is more?&quot; Mark said to Jack, but the kid didn&#39;t say anything. Instead, another electric shock came from the chairs. This felt a little bit different because it was making their stomachs to shake. It lasted a few minutes until the machines stopped.<br />
&quot;Testing phase two. Test subject 2, please talk.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you want from...&quot; Mark said, but he was interrupted by a loud burp from his mouth. &quot;What was... *burp* I can&#39;t... *burp*!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Test subject 2: succees. What about you, Test subject 1?&quot; The man said, Jack didn&#39;t say anything for a while until he released a long a loudy burp. &quot;Perfect. Let&#39;s begin the last phase.&quot;<br />
This time, Mark and Jack didn&#39;t talk each other fearing they could burp as they were speaking. A last session of electric shocks made them stay firmly on their chairs. Mark was feeling how this time the shock was moving through his whole body. He was scared of what could happen to him now when he felt his body sweating.<br />
&quot;Sweating? That&#39;s all?&quot; He thought. &quot;I always sweat under pressure, so this is not too different.&quot;<br />
But, what he didn&#39;t feel was that he was making a bad odour with his sweating. Until when he smelled Jack&#39;s odour, he realized what was this last stage. He hated bad smellings, so he begin to scream in order to stop the process.<br />
&quot;Stop! Please! *burp*&quot; But nobody paid him any attention. &quot;I stink! *burp* I stink! *burp*&quot;<br />
Then, he began to cry. In that moment, a scientist said it was enough and stopped the machine.<br />
&quot;Ugh! It&#39;s incredible how stinky smells these kids can make!&quot; A lab man said as he was looking at Mark who was covered in tears. &quot;I think it&#39;s enough for now. Child treatment, you can take our boys to the waiting room until the next testing. Thanks.&quot;<br />
The men with radioactive protection took the boys through the corridor. Jack was walking as if that was nothing but Mark was having some troubles to keep standing. Then, the men left them on a small room without windows, just a light above them and a couple of beds.<br />
&quot;We can relax a moment before they call us again.&quot; Jack said to Mark.<br />
&quot;How can you be to quiet?!&quot; Mark said. &quot;This is embarrassing! I don&#39;t want to stay here!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, this is for progress.&quot; Jack said. &quot;And, what is a little bit of reek or *burp* Hahaha.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care about progress! *burp*&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;So, why did you applied for this?&quot; Jack ask him.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t. My friends and I....&quot; Mark realized that he didn&#39;t know anything about his friends since they were on Raul&#39;s house. &quot;Raul! Kevin! Jimmy! I need to find them!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are they your friends?&quot; Jack said. &quot;Maybe they are in another areas. This place is huge! *burp*!&quot;</p>
