<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lost to my emotions, my mind was too focused on biting back at my sister than on guiding this body against it&#39;s will. So on instinct, in my anger, I heaved my chest forward and slapped both my hands to my hips. My sister&#39;s offense to the words I had spoken dissipated quickly, instead leaving her to once more spout... &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t believe it. You&#39;re definitely still Mom. This sucks, I wanted to be able to actually buy a decent outfit for once.&quot; I felt stunned. My own sister couldn&#39;t tell me apart from my mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m telling you I&#39;m--&quot; My words were cut off by Lucas. &quot;Come on Dad, what was this, some lame stunt? Seems pretty fucked up to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a stunt--&quot;I was interrupted again by a hand on my shoulder. It was my dad&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;re right Mariah. In the end, we felt a little too bad for David, so we opted against the procedure.&quot; The lie sent my whole heart launching into my throat. &quot;Aw, that&#39;s so lame. This is all because of your whining I bet, Dave.&quot; She addressed it towards me, but looked upon my mother. &quot;Tsh, that sucks. Now I gotta pay my college fees myself? Way to blow it, little David.&quot; Lucas added. &quot;I was lookin&#39; forward to callin&#39; ya Mom more too, hah!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was about to lose my mind, but my sister and brother were already discarding themselves from disinterest. &quot;What are you--&quot; I started to stop them, but my father held my shoulder tighter and pushed me into another room. Then another, then behind a closed door. &quot;What are you doing!? What was the point in lying!?&quot; I yelled at him. &quot;I think it&#39;s for the best. The idea of not telling them never even crossed my mind because we had to discuss this as a group. It&#39;s perfect though. You have to be their mother now, and now they will believe you are 100%.&quot; I hated that it made any sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention, they won&#39;t know we got all that extra money, so we can keep it to ourselves.&quot; Mom added, peaking her through the door and letting herself in. &quot;Now I can really be David, and you can be mom. It&#39;s perfect. It&#39;ll really be like nothing changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not bad enough I have her body, now I can&#39;t even tell people I at least USED to be Dave? What about my friends!?&quot; I exclaimed, once more finding myself inches from another breakdown. &quot;That&#39;s... a conversation for another time. It might be complicated if you tell your friends only, but... I think for right now, it&#39;s best if you don&#39;t tell your brothers or sister.&quot; He reasoned. I hated it. &quot;Besides, you were nervous about them making fun of you, weren&#39;t you? I could see you shaking on the ride home, and the closer we got the worse it got. This is a relief isn&#39;t it? Now you can just be their mom and be done with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it this way, Mom. If they think you&#39;re me, like really think you&#39;re me, they&#39;ll have to listen to you. You&#39;re their mom now, which means you can make Mariah do all sorts of chores.&quot; My mother put forth, what might have been, the first and only thing that actually sounded like some mild plus. I WOULD be able to order Mariah and Lucas around like our Mom did. &quot;I&#39;ll think about it, for now, just... leave me alone!&quot; I stormed off. Instinctively, I went towards my own room, but decided to head to my mother&#39;s, even if I hated the idea of it.<br />
<br />
Once I was inside, I headed straight towards the nearby mirror. Mom&#39;s face was there to greet me, in all it&#39;s quirky nature. &quot;My own sister didn&#39;t believe I was Dave...&quot; My reflection gave me a pitiable smile, while shaking it&#39;s head. Shaking a bit from the defeat, I sighed and slid my hands up to my face, feeling my odd new cheeks just for a moment before passing my hands down my hair. I stopped at my neck. &quot;I&#39;m doing it again...&quot; Realizing that, I thought back to my moment with Mariah, and with my jaw rigid with distaste for it... realized I had yelled at her just like my mother always did.<br />
<br />
I spent the next 20~30 minutes in-front of that mirror. Watching myself walk, move, engage with the environment around the mirror&#39;s field of view. At the end of it, I was shocked when I said... &quot;I can&#39;t blame my sister.&quot; Perhaps it was my perspective, from inside my mother&#39;s eyes, but I guess I just not aware until then just HOW much I had been moving like her, how much I was presenting as her in every tiny minuscule way. They were things that were so subtle I wouldn&#39;t have been able to describe them if I was asked, but watching my reflection, all I could think was... (&#39;Yeah, mom does that when she bends over -- and, oh yeah, I remember she does sort of scratch the shoulder straps of her dress every so often, and...&#39;) The list just kept going and going. I even went so far as to record messages of myself and listen to them back. Even if what I made her say wasn&#39;t something she would ever have said, hearing it back... it just felt like I was listening to a recording of my mother in every way. How the words were spoken, how and when she paused, it was... heartbreaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really can&#39;t blame her, if she came home like this, I wouldn&#39;t have believed her either...&quot; I said as I sat on the edge of the bed, a look of utter defeat upon my face. It just seemed so weird, I knew how to be a boy, I know I did. I remembered adjusting my pants for my balls, but as I reached down to mirror that action, I found myself lost. I remembered doing it, I remembered having balls, but at the same time... my body didn&#39;t. In truth, I didn&#39;t really remember the actual feeling of them, just the memory of the feeling. So as my new hands danced about this empty space, I found myself unsure what to do with them to mirror my boyhood actions. After-all, this body had no memory of how to do any of that. Instead it knew how to navigate around these inhuman-sized breasts, adjust for the constant weight changes, or how and when to hold back it&#39;s hair when bending it&#39;s neck. Even if all of those things were new to me. It was so mentally confusing, this situation. The end result was the same however, I looked, sounded and very much presented myself as my mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six months like this, can I really last? Can I fix these instincts, or am I just going to end up as Mom in my head too? What if I can&#39;t become someone else in six months? I feel like I&#39;ll lose my mind. I&#39;ve only been mom for... maybe an hour and a half, maybe two hours. Yet I already feel like I&#39;m about to lose it.&quot; I felt numb when I had spoken the words, but out of nowhere, I found myself crying without any control over it. Perhaps Larry was right, maybe I was experiencing mood swings.<br />
<br />
The question inevitably became, how did I want to spend these six months, and possibly the rest of my life...</p>
