<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha didn't know she didn't like more. Getting the same message via e-mail, her <br />
cellphone, her IM program, and on-line journal... or that it was apparently from Mr. Smith <br />
demanding that she show up for work practically at or before dawn or not being showing <br />
up again ever.<br />
<br />
Martha didn't like either at all. She hadn't even GIVEN Mr. Smith her IM address! He must <br />
have found it on his own. 'That could be considered an invasion of privacy!' Martha Jones <br />
thought. Why did she even work for these people?  Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Smith were SO bad, <br />
a little uppity and aloof but they were people with money and that was pretty much <br />
expected in western culture. But Jennifer, UGH, that girl a spoiled rotten little brat! She <br />
treated Martha almost like a slave! Martha was just glade Mr. and Mrs. Smith had never <br />
thought to give their daughter Martha's phone number. <br />
<br />
And that brought her back to her question. Why did she have this job? Oh right, the old <br />
catch-twenty-two, she couldn't get a job without experience, and she couldn't get <br />
experience without a job! So she had been reduced to the role usually reserved for old <br />
ladies. Mr. Smith HAD promised to give a good word in for the job she DID want after her <br />
contract expired, and while Mr. Smith was a lot of things, not all of them good, he was a <br />
man of his word. <br />
<br />
'But what I don't get is, why does my contract say I have to show up dressed up already?!' <br />
Martha decidedly did not enjoy the catcalls her cliche maid's uniform attracted. But the <br />
Smith felt appearance was everything and that included their work hands. The staff had <br />
been granted as a whole the day off the day before (as said before, Mr. Smith was not <br />
without honor). <br />
<br />
Martha was let off by the bus, and walked towards the estate, passing through the main <br />
gates and down the driveway towards the impressive homestead. Martha shuddered, she <br />
felt like someone was watching her, she looked around but saw no one. Okay, so much for <br />
that phobia. <br />
<br />
Still feeling unnaturally uneasy Martha made her way to the side door reserved for the <br />
staff (she refused to use the term 'servants.') 'Why am I so scared? I've been here a <br />
thousand times before.' She considered for a dark moment that Mr. Smith had called her <br />
in early so he could violate her, but she shook away the paranoid thought. 'If Smith had <br />
wanted to do that, he'd have done it a long time ago.' <br />
<br />
When she walked inside the foyer she flipped on a light switch illuminating the room. She <br />
closed the door behind her and walked about four steps before something big and heavy <br />
came down behind her. She turned around and the scream died in her throat at the <br />
hulking redding brown female like wolf monster in front of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Martha, I'm Little Red Riding Wolf, but you can call me Kaylee, or Alpha <br />
Female soon enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha did the smartest thing she could think of and -ran- but she didn't make it out the <br />
door on the opposite end of the room (the door of which seemed to be missing from the <br />
door frame). A even larger wolf monster, this one painfully obviously male and as black as <br />
night obscured her path. She took only a momentary note about the bandage around one <br />
of it's legs. <br />
<br />
On the beast's shoulder was a smaller wolf monster with the build of a child. If Martha <br />
wasn't terrified, she might have admitted the small one was actually kinda cute. <br />
<br />
As the only adult wolfen they had still with the game, Jensen had wanted to hold Fran in <br />
reserve. That left the wolf cubs sans Bart who used the game to change the Perkins into <br />
his younger brother and sister.  And Marcy's game was to be reserved for when they tested <br />
the nature of the game. And Jenny wanted to have the game ready if she ran into a snag <br />
over the phone. That left of course Kevin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Martha. It's me Jennifer, though now it's Big Bad Wolf, Jensen, Alpha Male, Mi'Lord, <br />
or just Master. There have been some improvements around her since yesterday, and I <br />
have a new position for you to fulfill.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha back pedaled only to smack dab into the female monster behind her, who <br />
overpowered her like a gorilla would a babe and brought Martha down to her knees and <br />
hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have it all memorized Kevin?&quot; The bigger monster asked the smaller one on his <br />
shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lord Papa.&quot; It nodded eagerly and excitedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Then let's get started before any other staff arrive. Martha is going to play a very <br />
important role for us after all. And remember what I told you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lord Papa!&quot;<br />
<br />
The small beast leapt off the big one's shoulders landing perfectly and easily in front of <br />
Martha's face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hiiii, nice to meet you Martha, I'm Kevin of the Big Bad Wolf pack! The Master wants me to <br />
tell you how much he really, really, REALLY likes you, and how much he really really <br />
REALLY wants you with him in the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha's eyes widened at the underlying words. <br />
<br />
Which Kevin missed entirely, and as Jensen predicted, Martha easily picked up. <br />
<br />
&quot;But first there's a quick game we're gonna play, I ask, and you answer as fast as you can.&quot; <br />
Kevin said in a polite friendly sportsmanlike voice.  &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha shuddered. She had heard of that dreaded game, but it was just a myth right? <br />
Something Glendale encouraged the tabloids to print to attract the occult nuts for the <br />
tourist build right? But considering she was surrounded by monsters, she couldn't exactly <br />
pretend that it was now outside the realm or possibilities. <br />
<br />
Martha had heard that Transform meant they could change you into anything. Dare meant <br />
they could make you DO anything. And she could easily guess what 'do anything' meant <br />
right now! Screw it, she'd rather be a side show freak than some mindless empty headed <br />
love doll. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot;  She said defiantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool! That's the one the Master -wanted- you to pick!&quot; The little wolf cub cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;What-?!&quot; Martha yelped still being held down. <br />
<br />
Kevin recited the transformation like a Grand-A student at a spelling-bee. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will transform into a humanoid she-wolf. You are loyal and devoted to the master, <br />
Jesen, big bad wolf, alpha male, beyond question, nothing may break your loyalty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform includes transforming personalities too Martha.&quot; The big beast said smugly. <br />
<br />
Kevin wasn't done. &quot;You will be, and shall always be, Pack Omega, you shall be the lowest <br />
of the low among us save in your appointed task. You shall desire the master but know <br />
that you are unworthy of him and will never have him, and the only comfort you can gain <br />
is in carrying out his will.&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha stared in horror and vainly struggled to break free. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall have four arms, and four breasts, two tails, and two heads with three eyes each <br />
head connected to the same brain. You appointed task shall be to look after, manage, aid, <br />
take care of, care for, and keep in check the pups and cubs of the big bad wolf pack. In <br />
this matter alone you shall have any respect or authority, and the pups and cubs shall <br />
respect and honor your authority on this matter. You can dance beautifully. On the day or <br />
night of the full moon or new moon when you dance in front of someone who is not a <br />
member of the pack they shall dance with you and transform into a big bad wolf pack <br />
member who is totally and shakably loyal to the master and the pack who care nothing for <br />
their former life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen had GREATLY considered instead for her to need milking of her breasts every full <br />
moon instead that would transform any non-wolf who drank it, but he felt that would have <br />
been too cruel. <br />
<br />
Martha was horrified beyond all recognition. She brain struggle to process the horrible <br />
fate that was no hardwired into her destiny. <br />
<br />
That was when she felt something, no, two somethings behind to push out of her dress. <br />
That was when she felt her muscle begin to budge everywhere. That was when she felt the <br />
most horrid splitting headache she had ever had in her life. That was she felt something <br />
growing under her arm pits. That was when she a tingling under her breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold her down until she's done Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I say it perfectly Lord Papa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it perfectly son! Absolutely perfectly! You're wonderful! Now now run along and <br />
help your brother and sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Lord Papa!&quot; Kevin bowed and was gone in practically a blur. <br />
<br />
Kaylee held the pressure onto of Martha as the second pair of breasts grew. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be hideous...!&quot; Martha lamented. <br />
<br />
Kaylee whispered in her ear, &quot;Actually from an artistic perspective you'll be quite <br />
beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha moaned even more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see this Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Without even needing further explanation, Kaylee tore off Martha's maid <br />
uniform, shoes, socks and under-things, leaving the poor young woman visible for the <br />
naked beasts to see her. Silver fur began to cover her body as her human hair remained <br />
the same light brown color. Martha shuddered as her feet shifted into clawed paws. Her <br />
muscle mass increased again but Kaylee still easily held her down. <br />
<br />
Martha looked down to see the new pair of breasts forming underneath the original, both <br />
covered in silver fur. Matha felt two new appendages emerge from her rear, both wagging <br />
madly and blindly as they reacted to her own panic. <br />
<br />
Her hands became articulated clawed paws as her arms muscle mass increased again, and <br />
-screamed- when a second set of claws were unwilling pushed out of her skin underneath <br />
her original arms, followed by fingers, hands and arms, already covered in fur and also <br />
now blood. The silver fur covered everything now. <br />
<br />
Martha blinked and suddenly, she had a new perspective, like she had a third view coming <br />
out of her forehead... oh no... <br />
<br />
Martha couldn't see it, but her eyes had become solid red, the same color as blood. <br />
<br />
Martha finally broke down and cried, knowing it wouldn't matter since she wouldn't exist <br />
soon as herself anyway. The tears from the new eye got into her original eyes. <br />
<br />
The bones in her legs rearranged, becoming digigrated. Her teeth all became canines, and <br />
her original canines became fangs. Her mouth pushed foreword into a muzzle to make <br />
room for the new set of teeth. While her ears vanished and reappeared as triangles on the <br />
top of her head. Sound and smell became completely different and wider in scope. <br />
<br />
Then the splitting headache got unbearably horrid. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how this part is going to go.&quot; Jensen said calmly. <br />
<br />
There was slurping and breaking and tearing sounds and blinding pain. Then her vision <br />
went from triple to sextuple, and her sense of smell and hearing double, and the new <br />
sensory input nearly drove her mad, almost, for the game would not let her go mad. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was gross.&quot; Kaylee commented, &quot;Let's never do this one again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Works for me.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
Martha shook her head, and felt something brush against her right, or was it her left? She <br />
turned her head left, to see the back of a head, or was the side of the room? She turned <br />
again and... Martha screamed and heard stereo. Finally she came face to face with her own <br />
face, her visible doubling. <br />
<br />
She looked into the face of a silver furred wolf with three red eyes looking back, confused, <br />
scared, alarmed, and with a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Martha?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to Hell.&quot; She heard her own voice in stereo. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess your mind changes next, aren't you lucky.&quot; Kaylee whispered. <br />
<br />
the innocent woman groaned and heard it double.</p>
