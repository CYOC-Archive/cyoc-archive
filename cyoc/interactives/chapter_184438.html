<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maureen’s change in height from her own 5’6 down to Liz’s 5’3 took some adjustment but given that she was now wearing Liz’s 3-inch heels perhaps the height difference was nullified. What she did know was that she felt stunningly beautiful and petite in this body as she walked out to Liz’s new Red Mazda parked on the street. <br />
<br />
She sat in the car and realised she did not need to adjust the seat as it fit her current body perfectly. She wondered what Liz would think about having to drive her old Ford if she did decide to do the grocery shopping however that was Liz’s problem not hers. For today she was Liz and as such had use of her car, her house and her body. She started the car and headed back to Liz’s house.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Liz watched Maureen depart then rushed back to the bedroom. First, she picked up the dirty clothes basket and went to Maureen’s laundry and got the wash happening.  Then she entered the ensuite, undressed and examined her borrowed body in the mirror. She hadn’t wanted to appear too nosy while Maureen was present but now she had a chance to examine her new body thoroughly.<br />
She was fat! Her waist was virtually non-existent, her tummy was floppy and her bum was all cellulite! Maureen clearly didn’t shave down below and her pubes needed a trim. At least it conformed that Maureen was a natural blonde. Liz couldn’t help herself and grabbed a pair of scissors she saw on the bathroom bench.<br />
<br />
On the plus side she was taller, had a pretty face, her hair was thick and luscious and the breasts were magnificent, though they did need support. She figured the large nipples must be a legacy of the three children Maureen had breastfed. <br />
If she was going to have this body for a day and head out shopping she wasn’t going to wear the old dress Maureen had worn to the yard sales. After trimming her pubes and cleaning up after herself, she put the bra and panties back on then went back into the bedroom and examined Maureen wardrobe.<br />
<br />
First was some nice underwear. She did not enjoy wearing the granny undies Maureen had bequeathed her. She found a lavender bra and panties set in a drawer which appeared to come with a matching camisole and half-slip. The satin felt nice against her skin. She then selected a grey knitted calf length dress. She could remember Maureen wearing this to her 50th birthday party. It came with a wide fitted belt and gave her the appearance of having a waist.<br />
<br />
She teamed that with some modest grey heels. She was taller now but if she wanted to appear slim she needed every extra little bit of help she could get. Now the clothes were complete she returned to the bathroom and went to work on her hair and face.<br />
It was with a little bit of trepidation that 25 minutes later she knocked on the door of Roger’s shed. Would he see through her straight away for the fraud that she was? <br />
<br />
She could hear Roger using power tools inside and figured he couldn’t hear her gentle knocking. She entered and sure enough he was using some sort of tool on a piece of wood. She remembered Maureen saying he was building a crib for their first grandchild which was expected in the near future.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to disturb him as he was working she stood at the door and watched. It was hard to believe this was the same tall dorky kid she had first met at college all those years ago. He was certainly a man that had improved with age. He was tall and well proportioned and had retained all of his hair though now he was getting quite grey. She had been a fool as a young girl and had chased the flashy men, those with muscles and money. Her ideal man had been right in front of her and she had gifted him to her best friend. Certainly, she would have been better off with Roger than either of her two exes’.<br />
<br />
Liz realized the drilling had stopped and Roger was looking at her.<br />
<br />
“Wow you look nice! Are you going out?”<br />
<br />
The moment of truth “Just going to get the groceries” she hoped she sounded like the real Maureen, she certainly sounded different.<br />
<br />
“Not your usual grocery shopping outfit” Roger observed<br />
<br />
“I just want to look my best”<br />
<br />
“So, for what reason do I thank my lucky stars for the presence of such a beautiful woman?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I was just wondering what you felt like for dinner”<br />
<br />
“Hmm” Roger was examining her. “Actually, I think it’s time I took you out to dinner. I’ve been neglecting my beautiful wife for so long. Besides this is the last piece of the crib. By the time you have done your shopping I’ll be assembling the pieces. I’ll make a reservation”<br />
<br />
While Roger was talking he had advanced to Liz. He put one hand on each side of her waist and drew her in. Before Liz knew what was happening he was kissing her on the lips.<br />
<br />
“What was that for? You’ll ruin my make-up”<br />
<br />
“Just checking that you’re still the most desirable woman I know”<br />
<br />
“And?”<br />
<br />
“You are. You’re a better kisser than Liz”<br />
<br />
“Liz?” Maureen had told her about kissing Roger while in Liz’s real body but Liz had to feign ignorance.<br />
<br />
“When she said goodbye to me earlier she gave me a kiss on the lips. It was quite uncomfortable. I’ll have to cease the flirting. She might be getting the wrong idea”<br />
<br />
Liz enjoyed flirting with Roger and didn’t want him to cease. She thought quickly “Actually I put her up to it. I wanted her to test your loyalty. You passed. Don’t think less of Liz”<br />
<br />
“I should have guessed!”<br />
<br />
“Actually, what did you think of it? I mean kissing Liz. Don’t you find her attractive?”<br />
<br />
“Attractive is an understatement. Liz is a stunner” <br />
<br />
“So, you enjoyed kissing her?”<br />
<br />
“Well I would have but I’m a married man. I couldn’t be unfaithful to you”<br />
<br />
“You do know that Liz finds you extremely attractive and greatly regrets ever introducing us”<br />
<br />
“That’s her problem. I’m happy with you”<br />
<br />
“She’s my best friend and she’s lonely. Actually, I have no problem with you and Liz kissing. Just don’t tell me about it in future”<br />
<br />
Liz was astounded about what she had just said. She had just given Roger permission to kiss herself! What would the real Maureen say? However, it was now too late to take it back.<br />
<br />
Roger was just standing there with a stunned look on his face. There was an awkward silence.<br />
<br />
“I don’t mean you should take it any further…. It’s just that I can see how attractive Liz is…. She wants you and…. Well if you want her then…. Well kissing is okay…. Maybe a cuddle or two” oh God she was digging a deeper hole for herself. “Um anyway I better go. I’ll put the washing out first though” she could feel her body blushing and walked back to the house. She could feel Roger looking at her.</p>
