<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Chantelle! I thought you were going to be gone for the day,” Shane heard Pete call out in surprise. Where Shane had been sitting on the living room couch, he couldn’t see the rest of Pete’s house, so he had to crane his neck to look behind him. A busty middle aged woman had stormed into the kitchen, hands filled with shopping bags. Pete was trailing right behind her with either a look of confusion or annoyance, Shane couldn’t tell which.<br />
<br />
“I was. Teresa’s kitchen apparently flooded so she backed out of hosting at the last minute, so now I’m stuck having everybody here. The lazy fat bitch probably didn’t want to have anyone over; she’s always been flaky, I don’t know why we even hang out with her.” Chantelle, Pete’s step-mom, had been unpacking her shopping bags before looking up at Pete expectantly. “Well, what the hell are you waiting for? There are more bags in the car, go get them already!”<br />
<br />
Pete glanced over at Shane, flashing him an apologetic look, before heading out of the house. Chantelle continued to unload her shopping bags, unaware of Shane as he silently observed her. She was in good shape, tall with a slim yet curvy figure. She had a sharp, angular jaw and razor sharp cheekbones. Shane could tell that she’d been gorgeous in her prime; while she was still pretty, it was clear that she’d had work done and hadn’t aged with grace. One too many cosmetic surgeries left her face looking smooth and plasticky, not quite natural. Feelin awkward, Shane finally decided to clear this throat to announce his presence. Chantelle let out a startled gasp, almost dropping the vase in her hand. She set the vase down on the counter and spun to face Shane, hands on her hips.<br />
<br />
“Who the hell are you?” Chantelle asked with a frown.<br />
<br />
“Uh…hi, I’m Shane. I’m a friend of Pete’s,” Shane jumped off the couch and approached Chantelle, arm extended.<br />
<br />
Chantelle looked at Shane’s outreached hand and gave him a quick dismissive once over, lips pressed together in a thin line. “Hmm,” She finally commented, turning back to her task without acknowledging Shane. Thankfully, Pete re-entered the house at the moment, relieving some of the tension in the air.<br />
<br />
“That should be all of them,” Pete told Chantelle, setting the bags in his grip on the counter beside the others. A loud clink was heard from one of the bags as it made contact with the counter.<br />
<br />
“Gently, Peter! There are fragile things in there,” Chantelle hissed, giving Pete a light cuff on the back of the head. “Do you ever stop to think?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Chantelle,” Pete grimaced, blushing red with embarrassment. He looked down at the floor so he wouldn’t have to look at Shane while his stepmom chastised him.<br />
<br />
“It’s my fault for expecting too much from you, as always,” Chantelle shook her head as if bemoaning the stupidity of her stepson. “Just stay out of my way while I get ready.”<br />
<br />
Pete gestured for Shane to follow him back out to the living room area, where the sat side by side on the couch facing towards the kitchen and Chantelle. Chantelle had grabbed a pair of headphones and was listening to music while she hurriedly tried to set up for her party.<br />
<br />
“I’m guessing she wasn’t who you’d been talking about when you asked for a favour?” Shane whispered.<br />
<br />
“No, she was supposed to be gone all day. The favour will have to wait, I guess,” Pete sighed, leaning forward and burying his head in his hands. Shane gave him a sympathetic pat on the back.<br />
<br />
“You two don’t seem close,” Shane observed quietly, eliciting a laugh from Pete.<br />
<br />
“That’s putting it mildly. The woman absolutely hates my guts. She never wanted a family. She doesn’t even love my dad; they never spend any time together. She just wanted to get married for the status symbol,” Pete explained, looking up and shooting daggers in Chantelle’s direction.<br />
<br />
As if she could feel his stare, Chantelle pulled her headphones out and glanced over at them. “Peter, your friend needs to be gone before people start showing up. Actually, if you could be out of the house too that would be great.” She slid her headphones back in and turned her back to them without awaiting a response.<br />
<br />
“She’s right, maybe you should go. I’ll try to call you later and we can try to rearrange that favour you still owe me,” Pete suggested.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that sounds good. Or…” Shane trailed off, glancing down at his phone and raising his eyebrows suggestively. Pete gave him a confused stare for a second before following his train of thought and breaking out into a grin.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I can’t change my stepmom!” Pete objected, giving Shane a playful shove at the suggestion. Shane could tell that Pete’s protest was an act and he really liked the idea; he just needed some convincing.<br />
<br />
“Why not? She makes your life a living hell. And it doesn’t sound like she makes your dad happy, either,” Shane pointed out. Pete looked from the phone back up to his stepmom, debating the ethics of what they were about to do. After another moment’s hesitation, he nodded his head in agreement.<br />
<br />
“That does sound kind of fun,” Pete admitted. He could see why Shane had used the program on him; the power of being able to control and change other people was alluring, almost seductive in nature.<br />
<br />
Shane pulled up Chantelle’s statistics on his phone:<br />
<br />
Name: Chantelle Laine<br />
Age: 48<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 5&#39;10&quot;<br />
Weight 140lbs<br />
Build: Slim<br />
Status: Married (Tobias Laine)<br />
Sexual Preference: Heterosexual<br />
Breast size: D cup<br />
Occupation: Marketing<br />
<br />
“Any suggestions?” Shane asked, looking over at Pete for input. Pete bit his lower lip, taking a minute to consider his options.<br />
<br />
“I have always wanted an older brother,” Pete finally said. Shane smirked and silently went about inputting the changes into the program. Once satisfied, he handed the phone over to Pete for his approval.<br />
<br />
Name: Chase Laine<br />
Age: 33<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian (75%), Native American (25%)<br />
Height: 6&#39;3”<br />
Weight 230lbs<br />
Build: Muscular<br />
Hairiness: Moderate<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Homosexual<br />
Penis size: 7&quot; soft, 10&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: Personal Trainer<br />
<br />
Pete nodded in agreement, and Shane confirmed the changes.<br />
<br />
As with the changes in the restaurant, the first modifications were to Chantelle’s gender. As she continued to tidy up the kitchen and prepare food and drinks for her friends, her large breasts were slowly starting to deflate, compressing back down into her chest. The tight pink blouse she’d been wearing was starting to loosen as her boobs dwindled away to nothing, leaving her flat chested. Meanwhile, a small bulge was starting to form in her yoga pants as Chantelle’s new cock emerged. The dick continued to lengthen and expand, the outline clearly visible through the tight material; even her large testicles could be seen through the fabric. The bulge grew, straining against the pants until they eventually tore, exposing her (or rather, his) massive member. With the cock now visible, Shane and Pete looked on as curly blonde pubes grew in around the crotch and balls.<br />
<br />
“This is incredible,” Pete whispered to Shane, his own dick hardening in his jeans. Steve’s changes had been one thing, but to watch his stepmom transform into a dude right in front of his eyes was turning him on.<br />
<br />
Chantelle’s entire body elongated, her spine growing longer as her limbs lengthened. Her feet grew bigger as long thick hairs sprouted from her toes; the blonde hairs spread up her legs as her quads and thighs thickened with hard muscle and definition. Her wide hips narrowed while her round, thick ass tightened and firmed up. Chantelle had been ghostly pale but her skin tone was growing darker, taking on a golden tan. Her shoulders broadened, tearing off the sleeves of her blouse to show muscled veins growing down her newly defined biceps and triceps. Her chest pushed outwards, two thick pecs forming where her boobs had once been; her pecs tore the remainder of her blouse to shreds, leaving her topless. Her tight tummy sank inwards, morphing into a defined six pack of abs.<br />
<br />
Chantelle’s neck thickened, a large Adam&#39;s apple forming. Her narrow jawline jutted out, squaring as blonde hairs sprouted and formed a chinstrap. Her pencil thin eyebrows thickened as her cold dark eyes brightened to a sparkling blue, her cheekbones vanishing as her facial structure changed and grew rounder. His long blonde hair retracted, reforming into a short, messy style. He looked a lot like Pete, just about 15 years older.<br />
<br />
Chase’s clothing shifted, his torn blouse becoming a tight navy blue muscle shirt and his yoga pants shortening into light grey gym shorts. The shopping bags had gradually vanished, leaving only a few remaining which were now filled with protein bars, groceries and video games. He took out his headphones and looked back over at Pete and Shane, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys, I got to run out to meet a client at the gym but I’ll be back in a couple of hours. Shane, are you going to stay for dinner? I’m cooking,” Chase offered, taking a few steps towards the teens.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I don’t know, I should probably get home and check in with my parents,” Shane replied, noncommittal.<br />
<br />
“Come on, it will be fun,” Chase pressed, mock pouting, “We can have a boys night. If your parents are that worried, I’ll write you a note.” Chase winked, then grabbed his gym bag and departed from the house with another wave of his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I wish you wouldn’t flirt with my brother like that,” Pete laughed, rolling his eyes.<br />
<br />
Shane glanced over at Pete, quickly realizing that Pete’s reality had been overwritten. Pete now only ever remembered his brother Chase with no memories of his stepmom Chantelle.<br />
<br />
“Don’t think I forgot you still owe me a favour.”</p>
