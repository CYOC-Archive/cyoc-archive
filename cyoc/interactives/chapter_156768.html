<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Austin didn’t know what he was expecting when he first entered the park, but he didn’t expect the park to look so… Peaceful.<br />
<br />
It seemed like a regular looking park. The trees took in the sun and allowed its rays to hit the ground like autumn leaves, creating an illuminated path for Austin to follow. The park’s appearance looked like something straight out of a romantic painting, all that was needed were some rich people eating pastries and commoners having picnics.<br />
<br />
The sound of wind chimes can be heard in the distance, the sound cascading through the park, like the light through the trees. Along with that, the quiet tweeting birds can also be heard within the trees. <br />
<br />
If he wasn’t aware of the park’s anomalous properties and the entity that lives within, Austin’s mind would probably be at peace as he explored the location. Still, Austin knew that his sister, and possibly this Aaron guy, was around here somewhere - He just didn’t know their fates.<br />
<br />
As much as he tried to look as cool and collected on the outside, Austin silently prayed that his sister was alright. If there was anything that would already make his life worse, it was discovering the dead body of the only non-cynical person in his life. <br />
<br />
He walked along the main path for a while and come to what seems to be a divergence of paths.<br />
<br />
“Shit.” Austin thought as he could sense that his work was cut out for him. <br />
<br />
He pondered for a moment and looked at a path marked &quot;No Trespassing&quot; when the smell of seawater hit his nose.<br />
<br />
Austin backed off and thought about it. He didn’t want to try and anger the owner of the place by trespassing, yet it felt just right that a fantasy lover like Anna would go into a path related to the sea. Knowing her status as a missing person, Austin quickly went into his backpack and brought out an item.<br />
<br />
A block of cheese.<br />
<br />
He took a portion of the cheese and tore it into little crumbs, Austin wanted to make sure he had a trail to go back to in case something within the path was dangerous. <br />
<br />
He looked at the “No Trespassing” sign and took a deep breath. He had to find Anna. Taking a step forward, Austin followed the path while dropping crumbs on the side. <br />
<br />
He followed that scent down the path next to the sign. After a while, the scent becomes stronger, and the air warmer. Austin looked around and saw that the vegetation was more lush and tropical.<br />
<br />
Austin’s mind seemed to wander for a moment before a flock of tropical birds suddenly caught him off guard, causing him to momentarily fall on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Fucking toucans.” He grumbled as he got up.<br />
<br />
Still dropping cheese crumbs nearby, Austin noticed that the birds came from a large tree following a small detour near the main path.<br />
<br />
Austin was not one for scenic detours, and he wasn’t going to follow a detour possibly filled with birds, so he stuck to the main path.<br />
<br />
After a couple more minutes of walking, Austin comes to a clearing and his jaw drops at what he sees… The OCEAN!<br />
<br />
With the sea this far inland, Austin figured it’s gotta be some type of trick or illusion. <br />
<br />
Freaked out, he turned around to go back the way he came. To his surprise and relief, the path he took was still there and a trail of cheese remained on the ground. Austin sighed, thanking his sky that his path back home hadn’t disappeared.<br />
<br />
Austin turned his head to see that he was on top of a cliff, with the ocean and some type of beach around the bottom. He wanted to go down, hoping that his sister was nearby.<br />
<br />
Austin looked around, wondering if there was some way he could get the beach without falling down the cliff and breaking every bone in his body. He was pleased to find that there was a grassy hidden trail that leads down the cliff but required just a little bit of a jump.<br />
<br />
With a hop, Austin landed on the sandy beach.<br />
<br />
“Great! I’m on a beach… Now, where’s Anna?” Austin wondered.<br />
<br />
Just as he made the mental comment, he saw a shirt, a pair of pants, and a bra. These were clothes - Anna’s clothes! <br />
<br />
“Anna!” Austin gasped.<br />
<br />
He rushed to his sister’s clothing and dug around her pants, which lead to him discovering Anna’s phone. Her device was turned on and still worked, even after water exposure and possibly weeks of being in sleep mode.<br />
<br />
Austin didn’t have a lot of time to celebrate before his heart sank. <br />
<br />
Anna was gone, and her clothes were right near a giant body of water. <br />
<br />
“No… Nonono…” Austin whimpered.<br />
<br />
He ran around the beach, only to see that there was no sign of his sister to be found. There was only one place where Anna could’ve gone and Austin tried to deny it, just hoping that she was around the corner… The eventual thought hit him like a truck,<br />
<br />
Anna’s body was lost to the sea.<br />
<br />
Austin fell to his knees and tightly held the clothes of his little sister. He sniffed. The only person who stuck by Austin, even after failing college, even after years of working in fast food, even after being a disappointment to his entire family - was dead.<br />
<br />
Austin felt tears roll down his cheeks and he couldn’t stop them. <br />
<br />
He felt awful, he spent his entire life just being content of being alone so much that he never bothered to ever say a word of thanks to the little sister that still somewhat saw him as the hero he thought he would grow up to be. <br />
<br />
Everything felt hopeless. Then Austin heard a splash.<br />
<br />
“No....” His mind said. “It couldn’t be…”<br />
<br />
Austin wiped his eyes thoroughly, hoping that his mind wasn’t playing tricks on him.<br />
<br />
He pinched himself, hoping that this whole experience was just a bad dream. That he would wake up in his bed and that his family was alright, no parks or beaches to seen.<br />
<br />
Austin opened his eyes to meet two figures with their upper bodies breaching the water’s surface, one male and one female. His mind blurred what the male looked like, but he seemed to have a bag of some sort in his hands.<br />
<br />
What left Austin speechless when he saw that the female figure resembled the face of his sister. He could recognize that face from anywhere. <br />
<br />
Austin’s eyes sparkled as he gazed upon the figure in awe.<br />
<br />
“Anna…”</p>
