<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor got off the elevator and began to move toward her new apartment number, apartment 612 was sadly not located right next to the elevator but it wasn’t too far. Overall, it looked like a normal middle/upper middle apartment building complex. The floor was titled to make it easier to clean, the only thing that was a little weird was that the hallway and the doors themselves where taller than normal.<br />
She reached the door and was about to knock, she was tempted to use her new key but didn’t. <br />
<br />
In the end she didn’t have to, as the door opened as a woman almost ran right into her. <br />
<br />
She was at least as tall as Taylor was, so around 6’1 or so, her skin was a sickly green color, but her body was to die for. Her head snapped up and looked at Taylor with yellow slit eyes, her face was still totally human aside from the sickly green color and dark green lips and eyebrows. She was wearing a normal looking sports bra, like one someone would wear on a run, she even had an armband around her arm where her cell phone was. There was, however, no way she would be going for a run, because from her hips down, her legs were merged together into a long scale covered snake tail. Her tail colors were a mixture of dark greens and rich bronze color. She had a makeshift bottom to cover where her womanhood would be.<br />
<br />
The real thing that stood out however was her hair, her dark green hair was at first seemed to be in thick braids but then Taylor noticed that they were moving on their own. All those braids snapped forward, showing multiple open mouth snakes all hissing at her.<br />
<br />
“Oh…sorry.” Said the women as all her hairs kept hissing. She turned and looked at her hair on one side “Calm down.”<br />
<br />
She repeated the command to the other side as her hair went back to resting but kept moving a little. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about that, can I help you?” inquired the woman, she was a Medusa for sure.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I am Taylor…I was assigned to live here.” Explained Taylor as the women blinked as a huge smile formed on her face, showing her fangs.<br />
<br />
“Your our new roommate, welcome, I was about to go out to get some sun but come in, I am Mary by the way.” Said Mary as she moved to the side to let Taylor in. “Ladies we have our new roommate.”<br />
<br />
The apartment looked like a normal set up, a small kitchen to her right with a living room attached and what looked to be a balcony. Two hallways lead toward what she assumed to be the bedrooms and bathrooms. Like everything else, the rooms where taller and overall larger.<br />
<br />
Sitting in a chair in the living room with her feet up on a wooden coffee table and a remote in her hands was another one of her roommates. <br />
<br />
She was covered with white and blue scales, from head to foot with some dark blue hair coming from the back of her head. Her face was that of a classic dragon with a pair of yellow horns going backwards. Her running from her chin, to where it disappeared under her shirt was yellow scales. A pair of dragon like wings where folded up behind her as she rested in her chair, a long but thick tail rested to her side as well. Each of her feet was shaped in a way so she walked on only the front of her legs but each of her three toes had long yellow claws. <br />
<br />
“Oh…Hello.” Said the dragon women as she stood up, she was a giant, the top of her horns all but touching the ceiling. Her bust had to be at least H cups if not something larger but on her massive frame it worked. <br />
<br />
“Hello, I am Samantha but call me Sam.” said Sam as she offered her hand.<br />
<br />
“Taylor.” Introduced Taylor, taking her hand which was swallowed by the much larger hand of Sam “You’re a dragon person?”<br />
<br />
“Dragonborn…I play a warrior protecting the massive Ice dragon.” Explained Samantha “And you’re a succubus?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Taylor “I just transformed yesterday.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, a true Newby not a transfer.” laughed Mary as she curled in on a spot where a chair would normally be as she sat on her own tail. “Sit, we our other roommate is still at work at the park but she should be back in a little bit.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Confirmed Taylor with a smile. <br />
<br />
“So what job do you have?” inquired Mary<br />
<br />
“Priestess at the new Hell Church.” Explained Taylor “My father was a pastor and I song in the choir so I think I will do good.”<br />
<br />
“You should be good, I would be more worried about what your pastor father says about being Priestess in basically a church to the devil.” Stated Mary “My dad freaked out when I decided to work here.”<br />
<br />
“Mine as well, then they heard how much I will make.” Laughed Sam<br />
<br />
“Well, he disowned my transgender ass the moment he found out his son was actually a woman in her heart.” Said Taylor, he had to share that news sooner or later. <br />
<br />
“Ah…” said Sam “We have a few coworkers like that. This is a welcoming place.”<br />
<br />
“Very true.” Confirmed Mary “Aside from the guests, it is a great place to work.”<br />
<br />
“Guests…they can be such a pain in the ass.” Confirmed Sam “I am lucky, I wear heavy armor and with a spear as I help people get photos of themselves with a full dragon. Not like you, Mary.”<br />
<br />
“I wear a bikini top, smaller than this and a metal skirt while I scare people in the classic monster maze.” Stated Mary “Some creepy men and women, think it is ok to touch us without our permission. That is horrible.”<br />
<br />
“I can imagine.” Confirmed Taylor “I am doing a show and then standing in a study for people to watch me in line for a ride.”<br />
<br />
“So you shouldn’t have deal with that much.” Confirmed Mary<br />
<br />
“I would be more concern about protestors more then anything else for her job as a priestess in the hell show.” Countered Sam as Taylor raised an eyebrow. “There are some nut jobs, mostly the religious ones who have been protesting the new additions to that land, including the Hell Church thing.”<br />
<br />
“Didn’t hear a peep out of them when they expanded the “good” mythical land, the Angels and the like.” Stated Mary <br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, I just really want to get settled in and possible go shopping for some new cloths.&quot; said Taylor, she had always dreamed of going shopping as a real women. &quot;The company has only given me like six outfits and all of them basic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shopping?&quot; said Mary her yellow eyes widening as her smile grew even wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, someone said the magic word.&quot; stated Sam as suddenly the front door opened as the last roommate entered.<br />
<br />
Who is it?”</p>
