<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jace blinked as the white light cleared. Breathing deeply, he saw that he was... in the same room. The same messy, frat room. He looked down and caught a familiar view - the same hairy pec shelf, the same thick hands, the same noticeable bulge in his singlet. He breathed a sigh of relief. He had no idea what the &quot;penalty&quot; was going to be, but he had kept his hunky bod, and he was still the wrestling jock he had grown accustomed to. And now he didn&#39;t have to worry about that stupid tutoring thing. He checked himself quickly in the mirror and grinned as he caught his reflection - he was still the same handsome, built, hairy jock. Still ready to head to practice and put his body to work. <br />
<br />
Jace turned as he grabbed the last of his gear and saw a flash of yellow out of the corner of his eye. He turned back to the mirror and saw... the yellow was on him. On his head. He blinked as he did a double-take. His hair - still thick and curled and for the most part dark - now had blonde streaks in it. He grabbed at the locks of blonde hair and, sure enough, they were real. Looking closer at the mirror, Jace saw that although he was still the same stocky jock there were... other changes. His beard was a bit more trimmed, a bit neater. His skin was a tad less blemished. The chest hair popping out of his singlet was still prominent, but a bit more tamed. For the most part, he looked exactly the same. Just now he had the air of someone who looked after their appearance, not some lackadaisical frat boy. Jace stepped back to take in his full body and thought that it all looked the same. He was still clad in the college singlet which, maybe it was just Jace&#39;s imagination, seemed to be cut in a slightly different shape? A bit more of a scoop showing off more of his chest, riding a bit higher up his hairy thighs, and maybe - just maybe - a bit tighter in his crotch?<br />
<br />
Jace peeled himself away from his mirror. So the app had made a few, minor changes to his appearance to penalise him for cancelling that tutoring task - for the most part he was the same right? And that meant, he was still late for training. Coach was gonna kick his ass, Jace thought as he grabbed his bag and ran out the door, and down the stairs. Jace turned to the landing, bumping right into Marcus. &quot;Whoa, easy there. Hey bro, you&#39;re in a rush.&quot; Jace was glad to see Marcus, a reminder that most things hadn&#39;t yet changed. &quot;Hey bro. Do I look... any different to you? Like, my hair&#39;s got these blonde bits in them.&quot; Marcus looked confused. &quot;Erm, dude, you got those blonde highlights last month or something. You said the ladies loved them.&quot; Marcus paused as he eyed up Jace&#39;s whole body. &quot;You look the same as ever Ace. I like the wrestler look man, it fits you well.&quot; Jace was confused. &quot;Wrestler look? Bro, I&#39;m off to practice like you said.&quot; Jace made his way to the door, but Marcus replied &quot;practice? As in wrestling practice? Ace, you aren&#39;t on the team any more. Not since you dropped out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jace turned and saw that Marcus was being serious. The app, it hadn&#39;t just made some changes to his appearance, he wasn&#39;t even a student any more? Had anything else changed? Marcus continued &quot;Ace, are you going out dressed like that? You aren&#39;t technically allowed to live on campus with us anymore, you need to be keeping a low profile. I know that doesn&#39;t exactly fit with...&quot; Jace interrupted him. &quot;You keep calling me Ace.&quot; Marcus stared at him, &quot;eh, yeh man. That&#39;s what you asked us to call you when you dropped out. Are you okay man?&quot; Jace nodded absent-mindedly. Another change. What was going on? &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve got another appointment, hence the singlet? Just cover up and be safe, yeh?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marcus left Jace by himself. Appointment? What was Marcus on about? Jace needed some air, he needed to think though the changes that were happening. Taking Marcus&#39; advice, he grabbed a hoodie from the rack and some sweatpants that were hanging over the back of the sofa - they clearly weren&#39;t his, as they barely fit over his chunky thighs and ass, and he had to pull them up his legs so they didn&#39;t drape along the bottom. He looked quickly in the mirror, was relieved when he didn&#39;t see any more changes, and then made his way outside. Jace breathed deeply in the fresh air, and pulled out his phone - what would the app show now? All it showed was directions to somewhere across campus, with no indication of what or who was at the other end. Jace figured that he needed answers, some clue as to what had triggered the few changes. Something that had changed up his hair and stubble, something that had seemingly changed his name, something that meant he was a college dropout.<br />
<br />
Jace followed the directions, and quickly became aware of the looks and gazes from passing students. Jace had long become used to some staring and winking - he was a stud after all - but it seemed to him that this went further somehow. It got the sense that people were speaking about him in hushed whispers, or pointing him out to friends. This wasn&#39;t just students admiring the Big Man on Campus, this was something different. Jace pulled up his phone to distract himself from the looks and saw that he had been bombarded with notifications. Tentatively hiding the TaskRaccoon app - making sure not to cancel the current task - he saw his phone was riddled with texts, WhatsApp messages, voicemails, Instagram notifications, the lot. He had never been the most social guy as Josh, so it was almost overwhelming to be on the receiving end of so much attention. He pulled up his profile on Instagram on stopped in his tracks. The profile - using the moniker AceCosta - was just a series of pics of him. And not what Jace would consider normal pics, but each pic was a clearly thought-out thirst trap. He was shirtless in most of the pics, or otherwise wearing tight clothing that revealed his chest and hairy pecs. There were a lot of shots of him in tight shorts, speedos and even - Jace gluped - just in his jock strap. He scrolled through as he saw his hair move from the blonde highlights, to the thick hair he had gotten used to, to a buzzcut look. He looked stunning in each of them, showing off his muscles, his hair, his face, but where were the photos of his friends, of trips, of normal college days and nights. Was he some kind of giant narcissist now? Even his Instagram bio was just his phone number and a short message: Call me. <br />
<br />
Jace was so caught up looking through his pics on the app - was he naked in some of these, just his hands covering his dick?? - when he realised he had arrived at his destination. It looked to be a fairly standard block of student accommodation. Unsure why he was here, he followed the app&#39;s directions up a few flights of stairs and along the corridor before finding himself outside an apartment door. Where was the app taking him now? And why? He tentatively knocked and heard a voice on the other side shout &quot;coming!&quot; Was the voice familiar? Before Jace could work out if he knew the voice, the door opened and...<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon?&quot; Jace was surprised to see the guy who had tutored him earlier that day on the other side of the door. The same fair-haired, preppy guy who had tried - and failed - to teach Jace some basic Ancient Greek. Why had the app brought him here? &quot;Am I here for another tutorial?&quot; Simon laughed, as he ushered Jace inside. &quot;No, no more tutoring for you any more I don&#39;t think. I like the new hair, and I see you&#39;ve trimmed your beard a bit. I&#39;m flattered.&quot; It took Jace a few moments to realise. &quot;Wait, Simon, you can see that I&#39;m different?&quot; Simon sat down, grabbing himself a beer. &quot;Well, yeh, I can. The changes are for my benefit after all. I always did like blondes.&quot; Jace stared at him, and grabbed a lock of his blonde hair. &quot;So this was you? How? And why change my name to Ace and make me drop out of school bro?&quot; Simon looked slightly taken aback by this, but kept his composure. &quot;I didn&#39;t make those specific changes, I guess they must be ripple effects. Ace though? Seems a bit try hard to me.&quot; Jace was confused, was Simon behind this?<br />
<br />
  Simon laughed as he saw Jace&#39;s perplexed face. &quot;God, you really are that stupid jock stereotype, arent you? I wonder if that&#39;s who you&#39;ve always been, or if the app turned you into that.&quot; Jace stayed silent, and Simon continued. &quot;After our tutor session, I didn&#39;t think anything of it when I got a notification from that task app saying you&#39;d cancelled. I figured you had come to your senses that you were too dense to learn any Ancient Greek. But the app gave me a freebie. Because you had cancelled mid-task, I got one free task. Any task of my choosing. I plugged in something random, something I thought I wanted, I didn&#39;t think it could force you to do anything. But hey, here you are Ace, new look and everything.&quot; Jace was beginning to get a bit hot under his hoodie and sweatpants. What had Simon made him do? Could he back out of it? Simon must of noticed his discomfort. &quot;Ace, relax man. You must be hot in those clothes. Take them off.&quot; Simon&#39;s last sentence hit Jace not as a suggestion, but a command. A command Jace felt weirdly obliged to follow, starting by taking off his hoodie. He had barely started when Simon commanded. &quot;Take them off, but slowly.&quot; Jace felt himself slow down, taking his time as he unfurled the hoodie off his body, revealing his thick chest and arms barely concealed by his skin tight singlet. <br />
<br />
The sweatpants followed slowly, and Simon grinned as Jace&#39;s outfit of choice revealed itself. &quot;A singlet? Very nice. Playing into that dumb jock stereotype I see. Even if you aren&#39;t a student anymore.&quot; Jace&#39;s eyes bugged as he saw that Simon wasn&#39;t just watching passively, but was eyeing him up and... rubbing his crotch. It became apparent to Jace that Simon had a full boner on the go. &quot;Yeh, you&#39;re a thick as fuck jock, aren&#39;t you? Couldn&#39;t even keep up with sports science. Had to get a side hustle.&quot; Simon was rubbing himself more vigorously now and Jace, to his surprise, found that he was getting turned on by this. Jace&#39;s slow brain caught up. &quot;Simon, dude, what task did you set me to do.&quot; Simon grinned like the Cheshire cat. &quot;Look man, I was horny as fuck when I got the notification and I didn&#39;t think anything would happen, so I set up a task for you to suck my cock. And looking at that lump in your singlet, I think you want to.&quot; Jace shook his head, but he knew, deep down, that the main thing on his right now was whatever was in Simon&#39;s trousers. He couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off it. <br />
<br />
 Simon ordered him again: &quot;strip, slowly&quot; and Jace mindlessly complied, sensually removing the top straps of his singlet, and easing it off his body. He was stood in front of Simon in nothing but a tight jock strap, he dick visably throbbing. Jace felt both trapped, and exactly where he needed to be. Exactly where he wanted to be. Simon&#39;s hungry admiration of his body, it felt amazing. Jace reflected that the other changes - dropping out of school, changing his name, having an Instagram account exclusively of thirst traps - were all the fallout from Simon&#39;s seemingly casual request for Jace to suck his dick. Once again, TaskRaccoon had gone further. It had turned him into the campus himbo whore.<br />
<br />
&quot;God&quot;, Simon moaned. &quot;I love how horny you&#39;re getting. And I love the bleach blonde haircut.&quot; A further wave of lust swam over Jace and he reached down to feel his now fully erect cock. He moaned as he touched the sensitive tip, but stopped as he caught a glimmer of reflection in a small mirror behind Simon. His hair had gone beyond just blonde highlights, but was fully blonde now. He had the same loose curls, but they now dramatically offset his dark bushy eyebrows and stubble. Jace began to panic - Simon was still in control. Simon eyed up Jace with sheer lust and power as he spotted his new hair. &quot;Fuck ye, that hair looks great. I think it&#39;d look better though if you lost the beard.&quot; Jace watched in the mirror as his beard shimmered off his face, revealing with strong jaw. His clean shaved face with the blonde haircut was giving him full himbo vibes. <br />
<br />
Simon was rubbing himself though his trousers even more vigorously now, and Jace could tell he was beginning to get caught up in the power. Jace knew he should stop, should leave, should intervene, but he felt oddly powerless to do anything, stifled by horniness. He felt fully under the thrall of Simon&#39;s fantasy. &quot;You know,&quot; Simon moaned, &quot;you&#39;ve got such a great bod. I couldn&#39;t help but admire it during our session. There&#39;s room for improvement though.&quot; Jace gulped, but Simon barreled on. &quot;That rug on your chest and down your back, it&#39;s gotta go. You can keep the hairy ass though, although I&#39;d love for it to be even more of a fat juicy jock butt.&quot; Jace was immediately overtaken by dual sensations - an itch across his chest, torso and back, and a ballooning sensation in his rear. The overriding feeling Jace was experiencing, however, was an endless lust and his throbbing dick felt harder than ever. The bodily sensations soon ended and Jace gawked as his new reflection. His top half was now completely smooth, with no hint of body hair. He couldn&#39;t help but flex - his smooth, olive skin made his muscles pop and he had full view of his meaty pecs. He caught a glimpse of his new juicy, bouncy ass cheeks. Any movement he made, they jiggled uncontrollably. What was Simon turning him into?<br />
<br />
Simon stood up and downed his beer. &quot;That&#39;s much better. Although I hope the lack of body hair doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t be a sweaty boy, I loved your smell when we last met.&quot; Jace immediately heated up and as he glanced down he saw his new smooth chest covered in a wet layer of sweat, a musky smell now permeating the dorm room. Simon took another step closer. &quot;And I love your high cheekbones and thick, dick sucking lips.&quot; A numbing sensation flooded Jace&#39;s face and he felt his lips inflate. Simon started to unzip his jeans. &quot;But most of all, I love how desperate you are to suck this cock and how sensitive your ass is. You&#39;re already dripping cum.&quot; Jace closed his eyes and he felt overcome with lust. He needed release, he needed to do something to satiate this endless craving. He felt Simon&#39;s hard firmly grab his ass and he moaned, his whole body reverberating. Jace could barely think straight, could barely recall that this wasn&#39;t right, that he wasn&#39;t some horned up himbo. &quot;Pleaase&quot; he moaned. &quot;Let me suck your cock. Please.&quot; <br />
<br />
Simon obliged, swiftly pulling his jeans and underwear down and letting his hard cock bounce out. Jace almost immediately feel to his knees and - waiting for a cue from Simon - sat hungrily staring at his prize. &quot;Be my guest&quot; Simon said, triumphantly and Jace immediately went to work. <br />
<br />
Josh had never sucked a dick before, he would struggle to count the number of other dicks he had seen. Ace, however, was a world champion cock sucker and Simon felt weak at the knees. He was overcome with lust and almost came immediately, but Ace knew how to give him the best, longlasting blow. Simon grabbed onto Jace&#39;s head and moaned &quot;oh yeh, I love feeling up your buzzcut&quot;. Jace was too distracted on the task at hand to feel the sensation across his scalp. Ace started to pull down his jock strap, letting his beast of a dick loose, and was about to start rubbing one out when Simon interjected &quot;No, no, you don&#39;t need to do that. You&#39;re so horny you&#39;re gonna cum when I say, without having even touched yourself.&quot; Ace immediately complied, a lightning bolt of lust through his body. He was completely fucking turned on, and completely fucking Simon&#39;s. &quot;Yeh, that&#39;s right, you himbo slut. You&#39;re always gagging for this dick, in your mouth, in your ass.&quot; Ace knew it was true, he felt empty without a dick inside of him. &quot;You want me to fuck you. You love fucking guys and girls all over campus, and getting fucked even more. Fucked by other jocks, by nerds, preps, girls with strap-ons, even teachers. You dropped out cause you&#39;re too fucking stupid and cause you love it.&quot; The more Simon taunted him, the hornier he became. Simon was right - he was never smart enough for college, even on a scholarship. He was built for one thing only - getting himself and other people off.<br />
<br />
Ace began to suck Simon&#39;s dick with more vigor. The horny cycle continued until Simon shouted out &quot;ooh fuck, I&#39;m gonna cum&quot;. Ace was ready and as Simon came, Ace hungrily swallowed the full load and instantly came at the same time. In that moment, Ace felt complete ecstasy and clarity. His role, his purpose, suddenly seems so clear. <br />
<br />
Ace pushed himself to his feet, and gawked at his changed reflection once again. He was a study in contrasts. The smooth body, buzzed blonde hair, thick pink lips and fat bubble butt all stood against his thick frame, dark eyebrows, hairy ass, and large dick buried within wirey dark pubes. He was both soft and firm, strong but boyish, dominant and submissive. He was the perfect plaything for someone who to get fucked or to fuck.  With his vacant eyes and open mouth, the prevailing impression was one of stupidity. He was well and truly a campus himbo now. He couldn&#39;t help but feel himself up, his ass and dick in particular, and wasn&#39;t surprised when he started getting hard again. He had only cum just a minute ago and he was ready for another round? Simon must have noticed. &quot;Easy there tiger, I&#39;m not as quick back into action as you are.&quot; He playfully slapped Ace on the butt, causing Ace to whiver. &quot;You head along now, consider the task over. And if you fancy another round, swing by tomorrow.&quot; Ace nodded enthusiastically, and pulled Simon in for a wet kiss. He felt great - he was hot, admired and now would be dynamite in the sack. He started to get dressed, loving the feeling of the tight jock on his ass and how the singlet did nothing to hide his semi-hard cock. <br />
<br />
He went to grab his hoodie when Simon stopped him. &quot;How about you go out dressed like in your sweaty singlet, show everyone the himbo you are? And don&#39;t bother showering either - I want you to reek of sweat and sex. Got it?&quot; Ace, despite no longer being under Simon&#39;s whim under the app, still felt an urge to comply. That need, to take orders, follow suggestions, be submissive, was built into him now. It was part of the reason he was so popular throughout campus - he was always willing, always game to help others indulge whatever fantasies they wanted. He just loved someone else taking charge.<br />
<br />
It was with that mindset that Ace descended the stairs and emerged back on the campus quad. The sun was beginning to set, and while he felt a bit chilly wearing nothing but his singlet, he didn&#39;t care - he knew he looked good and was looking forward to the admiring stares. He pulled out his phone and grinned at the new followers, new messages. He had to get a photo in his singlet and show off his new clean-cut look - there would be some people out there willing to pay extra to live their dumb wrestler jock fantasy.<br />
<br />
Ace&#39;s fantasy was however quickly cut short. Walking across campus, thinking about his next hook up, he managed to miss the fact he was being tailed by campus security. It was too late when he heard them approach. &quot;Ace Costa? You are trespassing on school property with the intention of soliciting... eh, services. You need to come with us.&quot; Ace began to back away slowly. This wasn&#39;t right, this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen to him. Without warning, one of the security guards reached to grab him. The instincts of a former college wrestler kicked in, as Ace grabbed the security guard&#39;s arm and threw him down to the ground. After a moment of silence, everyone shocked by what had happened, Ace bolted.<br />
<br />
Ace sprinted as fast as his legs would take him, cursing the fact he still had a half erection, his large package flopping around in his singlet. What the fuck was going on? What was going to happen if he got caught? He tried to remind myself of his reality, who he really was. He wasn&#39;t some stupid, college slut. He wasn&#39;t a thick-built wrestler, he didn&#39;t suck cock, and he shouldn&#39;t be running away from campus security! He was Josh, a mild-mannered, quiet, clever graduate. This was all wrong, so wrong. He grabbed his phone, aware that there was only one way out of this - he needed a new task, any task that would take him out of this reality. He opened up the app and was about to select any random task when...<br />
<br />
Ace was tackled hard in the side by another guard and both of them went hurtling to the floor, Ace hitting his head against it. Ace began to drift out of consciousness just as he saw his phone fly into the air and come down to the ground with a heavy thud.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Josh was woken by a steady beeping noise. His entire body ached and his head was throbbing. He felt sluggish as his eyes slowly adjusted to his surroundings. Blinking slowly, he realised he was in a hospital or a clinic of some sort. He vaguely remembered being tackled, hitting his head. How had he ended up here? And was he Josh again? Before he could think any further, he heard a familiar voice. &quot;Hey you. Welcome back to the land of the living.&quot;</p>
