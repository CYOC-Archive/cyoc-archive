<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The soft light of morning shone through the small windows high above. Scott Mtumbu, the zoo's new lion, rested quietly on the hard floor. He didn't mind. Something about his new body seemed to insulate him from the discomforts of the human body. It just felt right.<br />
<br />
The door opened. Scott looked up. It was Dr. Greggor entering the room. &quot;Well good morning,&quot; he said, closing the door behind him. &quot;How's my patient?&quot; Scott could feel the warmth of his words as clearly as he felt the warmth of his sunbeam. &quot;You look physically fit. All your tests have come back good. I just wanted to fill you in on something that I think I forgot to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of that doesn't sit well with Scott, but there seems to be no malice in those words. He tries to feel offended or duped, but neither of those emotions will arise. The doctor continues. &quot;There's something else about the Mark 5 transformation you should know. Up till now transformees have had to rely on body gestures and noises to communicate. We have included a slight change to the brain that should help you communicate with your pride. You should be able to project your thoughts to others – even me if you want to. All you have to do is think about saying the words. Give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
^Just think about it?^ Scott thought. The idea hadn't crossed his mind before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; answered Dr. Greggor. &quot;I heard that question because you didn't just think it, you thought about saying it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott tilted his head. ^So you're saying I'm some sort of telepath?^<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, not exactly. You can't read minds. But you can sense the feelings of others. This should help you understand your pridemates more clearly. Of course you need to look at someone to send or receive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott thought about this for a while, watching the doctor who had brought him this wonderful change. But something overshadowed his thoughts, a feeling. He knew the feeling was not his own. It must have been coming from the doctor. It was – lust. Yes, he could smell it as well now. Dr. Greggor shifted his stance slightly. He was uncomfortable under Scott's stare – but not turned off. The lust must be toward him. ^So, is that all you came here for?^ asked the lion. He stood up slowly and began to saunter toward the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;<br />
<br />
^Come now Doctor, I can already feel your feelings. Now come out and say it.^<br />
<br />
The man cleared his throat. He hadn't expected to end up in this position when he came in. &quot;I, uh, had I proposition for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
^I know. You want to know if I will please you, is that it?^ The man nodded. ^It seems the cat's got your tongue.^ Scott could feel the power of his situation growing. He felt his large muscles move and shift under his skin. He saw the scrawny human shivering before him like prey. This was no equal. This was a subordinate. His ears lay back slightly. ^Perhaps you should be asking if I would allow you to please me.^<br />
<br />
Dr. Greggor felt those words in his mind. They came with such a power that they seemed to press down on him, seemed to compel him. &quot;Would you, allow me, to...&quot; he started.<br />
<br />
^If,^ Scott interrupted, ^you become mine. You are not my equal doctor. I am your superior. If you acknowledge me as your king, then I will allow you to please me. And you may even enjoy it yourself.^<br />
<br />
Slowly, the doctor nodded, casting his gaze down. Scott knew then that he had the man at his mercy. ^Disrobe. What is your name, mancub?^<br />
<br />
&quot;Craig, sire.&quot; He obeyed.<br />
<br />
Scott's virgin lion prick began to emerge from it's sheath in response to the power he felt. It was a new sensation as the cool air touched his warm member. ^Come here, mancub.^ Craig crawled closer. ^I wish to feel the insides of your mouth, mancub. If you please me, I will call you Craig. If you do not please me, you will always be 'mancub' to me. If you ever show anyone that you belong to me you will not live to see the next day. But if you do not bow to me in private then you will not live to see the next hour. Now obey.^<br />
<br />
Scott's words pounded down into Craig's mind, fighting against any self will that the man had. He leaned his head down under his king's belly and sniffed at his lionhood. The smell was intoxicating. He had been with Trevor before, but he had been weak. This lion was no weakling – he was royalty, and Craig was determined to obey.<br />
<br />
He traced his tongue down the shaft first, tasting it's saltiness. Then he engulfed it. Scott closed his eyes and relaxed. He was determined to enjoy this, but without making it any easier for the man below him. He could smell the man's precum already, but he ignored it for now. The man's head and tongue motions were getting faster. Scott could feel the urge welling up inside of him, but he tried to hold it back. The spines on his lionhood began to flare, but Craig ignored them, determined to please.<br />
<br />
Scott opened his eyes and looked down at the man. ^Off,^ he commanded. Craig knew what that meant. He had seen it before. Obediently he slid off his king's lionhood, but only after sucking hard on it one last time. It was enough to throw Scott over the edge. His thick lion seed splashed hard across Craig's face, into his hair, and down his beard. He did not move. Scott stood there panting. ^Not bad, mancub. Now on your knees. You will be received by your King.^ Scott had been blessed in the transformation with the sexual endurance of a human, and repetition of of lion. He was already ready for round two.<br />
<br />
The doctor turned around, crawling onto his hands and knees. Scott came around him, stepping over him and placing his paws on either side of the man's shoulders. The shier size of the lion made Craig shiver.<br />
<br />
Scott carefully lined up his lionhood with his subject's manpussy. Only a moment after he had gently found his mark, he forced half the shaft in. It caught the man totally by surprise. ^If you cry out,^ said Scott, ^I will be displeased.^ With that he forced the rest of his way through. Once in to the hilt he waited for the man to relax. Scott's gentle purring helped, sending ripples of pleasure through the man's entire body. Already his shaft was dripping. Scott brought one paw up to it as he began thrusting – shoving the man's essence against his paw as he thrust in and out. His barbs scraped inside the man's anus, but it only heightened the pleasure. With each thrust, Scott's mind imprinted the man's mind. ^Who is your king?^ he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are, sire,&quot; the man whispered.<br />
<br />
^What is my name?^<br />
<br />
&quot;King, Mtumbu,&quot; he answered between thrusts.<br />
<br />
Pleased, Scott picked up the pace, thrusting hard into the man's hole while rubbing his paw against his shaft. Their mental union brought them to climax together. The mancub's seed splashed against the floor while his rear was filled with his King's blessing.<br />
<br />
^I am pleased, Craig,^ King Mtumbu thought between pulses of cum.</p>
