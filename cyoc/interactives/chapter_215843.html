<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Candy could say anything Grotti&#39;s assistant run next to Lesily and whispered something in her ear. Then with a quick motion Lesily turned back to face Amanda and Candance.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems that I&#39;ve accidentally used too much power for you. It seems we have had this conversation before.&quot; Miss Grotti explained.<br />
<br />
Amanda and Candance looked at Lesily while scratching their head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see. Behind me is a machine that detect if a performance goes south and correct the time streams if necessary. I personally don&#39;t see the end result until it has happened, but rest assured, it&#39;s only a safety measure.&quot; Miss Grotti continued her explanation. &quot;So what it was that you were going to ask? Hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to swap ages with my mother.&quot; Candy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me trade some words with your mother before I do my performance? Ok, sweety?&quot; Lesily said and quietly tumbled near Amanda.<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s not your kid right?&#39; Lesily whispered to Amanda&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Amanda acted surprise as she heard this.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, my magic goes overdrive with &#39;dead folk&#39;, I&#39;m assuming that her real mother is dead or a supernatural being with infinite amount of time to spare. And let me explain, huu boy, giving near demi-god immortality to a 10-year-old is not the most pleasant problems to solve.&quot; Lesily explained.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok then do swap mine with her.&#39; Amanda said with nervous tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen. As I was about to say today is a wonderful day where we swap Lady Amanda&#39;s and Little Miss Candances ages with each other!&quot; Lesily shouted. &quot;As they both stare into the crystal I will exchange their life essense with each others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of the women looked relax and mesmerized by the light that the crystal emited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us start with modest number. Number 5! Five years worth of experience transferred from Amanda to Candy.&quot; Leslie shouted.<br />
<br />
Candy&#39;s body begun to grow in lenght as she begun to age from 10-year-old to 12-year-old pretty fast. Her pink sundress started to fade more gray from the pastel colored one she wore as it too grew in size. Her toes gained a bit of paint as they grew also a little bit bigger. Candy&#39;s body gained a small henna tattoo in her arm and her blonde hair received a black strike to show that she wasn&#39;t taking anyones shit.<br />
<br />
Next to her Amanda&#39;s body gained more tonal push-ups. The slide down from 35 to 30-year-old didn&#39;t show that many physical changes. The fashion in other hand had changed a bit as her body lost the tattoos the moment she became 30. Maybe her rebellious phase was something else or maybe she tried to live her glory days. Who knew. Amanda&#39;s C-section start to glow in red as it became more and more recent. Her chest begun to form damp spheres on top of the white crop top and the belly begun to have more meternal scars. Her hair grew shorter too revealing a little bit tomboys nature from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Candy, how do you feel?&quot; Lesily asked from a 15-year-old Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Doing fine. Listening to moodal music, watching old 80s band&#39;s concerts from my phone and overall feeling meh.&quot; Candy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s thing with your mother?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? You mean that liying Manda? She took me under her wing when I was a little child and treated me well like you know feeding and giving me place to stay. But ugh. She is hiding something from me I&#39;m sure of it.&quot; Candy continued her explanation &quot;Like why does she think that-&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily put Candy back in trance before she could woke her and Amanda from the slumber by her passionate monologue.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Amanda. How do you feel?&quot; Lesily asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, better. Candance is ... ummm ... a lot to handle for a 30-year-old mom. I&#39;ve tried to tell her by small messages that I might not be her mother, but you know... She&#39;s a good kid. I don&#39;t want her to just leave just yet. To me she is precious and I want her to feel loved.&quot; Amanda explained until she fell back into her trance.<br />
<br />
As you heard it folks. Amanda is still taking care of Cadance. But what do you think happens if we do another five year trade with these two?<br />
<br />
The 15-year-old Cadance jolted in her seat as begun to age five more years. Her breasts swole suddenly raising her sundress. Revealing her camel toe under the panties as she grew up rapidly. She had inherited Amanda&#39;s breast size as her D-cup size breasts turned her dress into a tight shirt. Lightly applied dark colored make-up begun to form in Candy&#39;s face while her face turned to young adult. The dress gained more length as Candy finally settled into her 20-year-old of age. She looked like that she had adpoted the early stages goth fashion and tried her best to highlight her face and big cleavage showing her top of her breasts to gain more attention whoever she met. <br />
<br />
Amanda in other hand dropped once more from 30-year-old to a 25-year-old. Loosing more mature assests and reverting back to more youthful look. Amanda&#39;s clothing took the biggest blow as her motherly breasts lost one cup size turning themselves back into C-cups. Her C-section was gone and replaced with a small tattoo resembling a womb. Her overall fashion kept the same as she wore a band t-shirt and a small skirt with fishnets. Her hair was very short and she had thick layer of lipstick in her lips. She looked like someone who was would reveal her tits just cause attention or drink shots if someone dared to. She still retained her motherly curves but felt like that she could gain some more anymore if she was older. Right now she was perfect model for a rock band&#39;s album cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Amanda, how do you feel?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Went to a concert, drank and pretty much had CRAZY time. WOO!&quot; Amanda shouted. &quot;Also IT*S MAAANDY! Fucking hate my old name. They call me Mandy since I love to partyyyy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily immediatly whisked her hand and Mandy went to a slumberland.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you Candy, how are you doing?&quot; Lesily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... How do I even begin? Living with someone who wants to go party all the time is ... tedious to say the least. Like I try to read, hangout with friends by myself and you know just vibe. But then this asshole of a Mandy just keeps pestering me. And ofcourse I have to please her since she own the whole apartment.&quot; Candy explains. &quot;But okay, don&#39;t get me wrong. I love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily raises her eyebrow and asks Candy to elaborate with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ... you know... We are gay..? Like Mandy and I still have those moment well she&#39;s my beloved girlfriend when she isn&#39;t having that much fun with the boys. She is Bisexual while I&#39;m fully Lesbian. Never had man in my life and I don&#39;t need one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily immediatly put Candy into sleep and woke up Mandy with a question related to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Open secret buddy. I fuck anyone I want. Read these lips! I. Fuck. Any. One. Candy ain&#39;t so special to- I mean... JUST FORGET WHA-&quot; Mandy aggressively confessed as Lesily put her once more into slumber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well look at that. Giving someone of your age and experience turns them into your lover. This has been weird turn of event. BUT! Would you like to see more trading or should we end this here and leave these two lovers alone..?&quot; Lesily say she wanted to hear what the crowd wanted to see.</p>
