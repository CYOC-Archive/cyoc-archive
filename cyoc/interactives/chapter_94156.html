<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another rainy Saturday, and no plans. Scott sighed as he swung open the front door of the house, shaking some of the rain out of his hair while holding the door open for his girlfriend, Kat. Under his right arm, he held a large plastic bag with a rectangular black box in it, the unique buy that he and Kat had found on their shopping trip. Maybe this will be interesting, at least, he thought. After removing their shoes, Scott and Kat walked into the kitchen to greet his two roommates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Scottie, wanna jump in?&quot; his roommate Cal said from the couch by the entrance. He was engrossed in a shooter on their new flat screen, which was nothing new for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later man. I found something at the mall I wanted to show you guys,&quot; Scott said, walking past him and setting the bag down in the kitchen. At the table was their other roommate, Melissa, who was browsing the internet on her laptop.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Melissa said, looking up from behind her screen at the box that was set unceremoniously on the table in front of her.<br />
<br />
Kat leaned up against the wall and shrugged. &quot;Some board game that we found. Figured it might be worth a shot, and the guy practically gave it to us. Which reminds me, have you guys heard of a store at the mall called Spells R&#39; Us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa shrugged, shutting the lid on her laptop and examining the box more closely. The box was completely black, save for gold lettering that gave the name of the game: A Game of Change: Second Edition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Sounds like something Cal would be interested in, though.&quot; Right on queue, Cal walked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Cal asked, investigating the mysterious black box on the table. Scott handed Cal one of the beers he pulled from the fridge before picking the box up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I was thinking, if no one else is busy tonight, we could give this game a shot. Got nothing else better to do, and it&#39;s at least something to do while we get hammered.&quot; Scott said, shaking the box a little bit. It seemed like it was a bit heavy for a board game.<br />
<br />
After a collective agreement, the four went and sat down on the floor in the den, the only place in the house that was clean enough to play. The first one to take a seat was Scott, carefully setting the box down in the center of the room. Scott was the oldest of the four at 23, but not by much. He stood at an average 5&#39;9&quot;, with messy black hair that he had to brush out of his eyes. His build is one that belongs to someone who works out decently, his pale skin reflects his tendency to stay indoors.<br />
<br />
Next to him on the floor sat his girlfriend Kat. Standing a bit taller than him at 5&#39;11&quot;, Kat always liked to tease him about their heights. She has red dyed hair which was cut short into a cute bob which complemented her blue eyes. She has a toned build along with modest B-cup breasts.<br />
<br />
Next in the circle was Cal. Cal stood at a tall 6&#39;3&quot;, and was the &quot;nerd&quot; of the group. His short, blonde hair was spiked in the front, and his thick-framed glasses were one of his most noticeable characteristics. Cal was skinny, which was easier to notice matched with his height, sharing the same pale skin tone as Scott.<br />
<br />
Finally, on the other side of Kat was Melissa. Melissa stood at a shorter 5&#39;6&quot;, with blonde hair that was done up in a ponytail. She possessed quite the curvaceous figure, with large D-cup breasts and an ass that balanced out the top. However, despite the looks, she was an aspiring law student, still working her way through school.<br />
<br />
Scott took another sip of his beer before sliding the lid off of the box. Inside was the gameboard, a pair of dice, and about ten gold playing pieces, each of them a small, androgynous person. Scott placed the gameboard on the floor in front of them and unfolded it, revealing a path not unlike Candy Land. In the center, there was a spot where a stack of cards could be placed, however none were included in the box. Also puzzling, there were no instructions to come with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you guys got ripped off,&quot; Cal said, as the four grabbed a piece and set it on the starting zone. Cal looked through the box for anything else that they were missing, but found nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s lame,&quot; Melissa said as she set her piece down next to the other three on the game board. Once she did so, a beam of light shone from the center of the board and a female voice echoed through the room.<br />
<br />
Four newcomers to A Game of Change<br />
To help you prepare, a bit of advice<br />
After each roll, a card in exchange<br />
Now, choose a player to first roll the dice<br />
<br />
The four jumped at the voice before focusing once again on the gameboard. From the glowing square, a stack of black cards now sat, with A Game of Change: Second Edition written on them in the same text as the box. The four game pieces reformed themselves, and soon mirrored each respective player.<br />
<br />
The four of them backed up from the board. &quot;Holy shit, how did that happen?&quot; Melissa said, staring wide-eyed. The two guys sat in stunned silence, unsure if what they saw was real.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so freaking cool!&quot; Kat said with a grin on her face.</p>
