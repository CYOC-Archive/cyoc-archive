<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty felt an instinctive rush of fear as Kent and Jason -- the huge football and basketball coaches -- approached him, rapidly striding down the concrete sidewalk toward him. Even though Ty had enhanced his own size, these men seemed more than a match for him. Although the men were on the other side of the pool, about 100 feet away, they could cover that distance very quickly.
<br />

<br />
But then Ty smiled to himself as he realized that he had nothing whatsoever to fear -- provided that he could exert his power on the two studs.
<br />

<br />
&quot;ST..STOP RIGHT THERE!&quot; Ty ordered, trying to recover his composure, but the men two sneered and then laughed.
<br />

<br />
&quot;WHO'S GONNA STOP US, LITTLE MAN?!&quot; the 6'10&quot; Jason snarled. Thanks to his longer strides, Jason was now several feet closer to Ty than Kent was. 
<br />

<br />
Jason's words would seal his fate. &quot;Who are YOU calling little?!&quot; Ty  
<br />
responded with a laugh, and then directed his power toward Jason, who was now about 75 feet away.  
<br />

<br />
At that moment, Jason felt what seemed like a hot breeze engulfing his body. Jason stopped for a moment, not knowing what to make of the sensation, but then continued to stride towards Ty. 
<br />

<br />
Everyone at the pool watched in awe as Ty's power took effect. With each step that he took, Jason became shorter. Jason shrank proportionally, and his well-fitting shorts and XXX-long tank top shrank right along with him. This kept Jason from noticing the transformation right away.
<br />

<br />
In his first stride, Jason's height dropped to 6'7&quot;. One step later, he was 6'4&quot;, and with the next, he was 6'1&quot;. After just four steps, Jason was a man of about average height -- 5'10.&quot; However, since Jason had retained his basketball-player leanness, he now weighed just 150.
<br />

<br />
But Jason's time as an average-size man lasted only a moment as he continued to move toward Ty. In his next four steps, Jason shrank from average to extremely short -- 5'7&quot; ... 5'4&quot; ... 5'1&quot; and finally 4'10&quot;. As he looked ahead at Ty, Jason knew something was wrong, but couldn't quite figure out what it was. Ty seemed to be getting bigger. Could Ty be using his powers to make himself grow? 
<br />

<br />
&quot;JASON, STOP!&quot; Jason heard a familiar voice from behind his back. He turned his head back and was amazed to see an immense man -- from his perspective nearly 9 feet tall -- looming above him. It was Kent! The two men stopped dead in their tracks and stared at each other in shock. 
<br />

<br />
After a few moments of silence, Kent stammered, &quot;Y...Yo...You're sh...shrinking!&quot; Kent could hardly believe his own words, but the evidence was undeniable: his friend Jason, the former basketball center, was now under 5 feet tall!
<br />

<br />
Ty took advantage of their confusion to work a little of his magic on Kent. The 6'4&quot; 245 football coach had been big and muscular for nearly his entire life. Ty decided that it would be fitting for Kent to experience life from a different perspective.
<br />

<br />
As Ty concentrated his power, Kent felt the sensation of a hot breeze, just as Jason had moments before. Kent immediately began to shrink and lose body mass. Although Kent lost both height and muscle, his form-fitting shorts and muscle T-shirt shrank down with him to keep their fit.
<br />

<br />
Jason watched with some relief as Kent's height dropped, hoping that the shift in their relative sizes meant that he (Jason) was growing back. But as the transformation continued, it soon became apparent that it was Kent -- not he -- who was changing now. 
<br />

<br />
In just 10 seconds, Kent morphed from a 6'4&quot; 245 muscle man to a scrawny 5'1&quot;, 85 pounds. In the process, his massive chest deflated from 50 inches to just 29 inches and his waist contracted from a beefy 38 inches to 24 inches. Although Kent was still several inches taller than Jason, Kent was now the much skinnier than the lean, but still muscular Jason. Both guys had retained their close-cropped beards and so were obviously still men, but they were reduced to the height of 6th or 7th grade boys.
<br />

<br />
Ty decided that it was now perfectly safe to approach the two men. As Kent and Jason saw him coming, they turned to run away. &quot;Hold on...&quot; Ty said, with a voice that sounded more amused than commanding. But the little men ignored him and started running. 
<br />

<br />
Now Ty decided to really strut his stuff. As the Kent and Jason ran toward the locker area, they began shrinking again, but this time their shoes and clothes did not shrink along with them. 
<br />

<br />
Although skinny Kent shrank proportionally, Jason had another surprise in store: his weight did not drop as quickly as his height. As the transformation proceeded, Jason quickly morphed from lean to flabby, and soon he became downright chubby.
<br />

<br />
Although their shoes and clothes were small after the original round of shrinking, in this second round, Kent and Jason quickly outshrank them. The formerly huge athletes soon lost their balance in their oversized shoes, tumbling into a heap in the grass to the side of the pool sidewalk. 
<br />

<br />
Kent and Jason struggled for several seconds to disentangle themselves from their outsized shoes and clothes. When Kent rose to his feet, his shorts and briefs immediately slipped down to the ground. Kent was saved from total embarrassment only by the fact that his muscle T, which had fit him so well, now hung down well below his crotch and skinny butt.
<br />

<br />
Jason had a harder time struggling to his feet, since he hadn't yet figured out how to move his chubby body efficiently. When Jason finally was able to stand, his protruding pot belly kept his extra-long shorts up. Jason's tank top was now very loose at the shoulders and would ordinarily have been long enough to reach his kness. However, Jason's bulging stomach kept it from reaching that far.   
<br />

<br />
&quot;You should have listened to me when I told you to 'hold on',&quot; Ty said matter-of-factly as he sauntered up to the two pint-sized men and then looked down at them in amusement. 
<br />

<br />
The transformed Kent and Jason were now perfect testaments to Ty's power: Less than 5 minutes ago, they had been arrogant muscle studs. Now both their size and muscle had been taken away. They were just one tiny fat man and one tiny skinny man, each less than 3 feet tall.</p>
