<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Dan, I wanna get out of here.” Emily said. “I-I want to get a beer. I’m thirsty again.” Just thinking about beer made her thirsty. <br />
<br />
Emily pulled Dan out of the mirror hall without him noticing, he was too wrapped up in the discovery that he was transforming into a jackass.<br />
<br />
“I want a beer.” Emily brayed again. Her teeth were feeling funny. She ran her tongue across them. They were reshaping into squares and growing to close the gaps between them.<br />
<br />
While Dan was a little frightened, Emily was happy by this development. “I’ll graze good with these”, Emily thought to herself as she pushed through the end of the Hall of Mirrors.<br />
<br />
The two changing people came upon a door with EXIT on it. By now all the mirrors reflected the two of them as asses. <br />
<br />
Emily shoved the door open and pulled her mate outside. The scene outside was one of chaos. Carnival music still played merrily as the girls-if they could be called that anymore-still appeared to be having the time of their lives. <br />
<br />
A girl of Chinese origin ran by, completely naked, body covered in brown fur, and tail streaming behind her. Two donkeys grazed idly in a grassy area, thongs hanging from their tails. Still more were crowding onto a roller coaster whose cars were shaped like minecarts. They cheered and brayed as it disappeared into a cave.<br />
<br />
“Emily...everyone is turning into donkeys...including us! We hav-WWAAAAAWW HAAAAWW!” He yelped as Emily pulled him down the road, clearly intent on getting somewhere. <br />
<br />
Dan’s mind was clearing by the second, and he felt so.... wrong. His head felt like it was going to pull him over with his weight, and he felt his tail behind him, and odd weight like an arm. Then there was the cock. He could feel it, extended at the moment in his pants, and threatening to push his mind back into the pleasured haze he had been in for so long.<br />
<br />
Emily led Dan back to the bar they had visited earlier. Dan wanted to pull away but Emily just tightened her grip. She was much stronger than he remembered. <br />
<br />
Her own tail kept slapping him, the tip of it brushing against his groin. Every time it did Dan blushed through his fur. Emily for her part didn’t seem to notice his distress.<br />
<br />
They made it to the bar, still full of changing girls, though much more changed than before. There were some with full muzzles, some with hoof hands and feet, and some full jennies lapping beer off the floor.<br />
<br />
The bartender grinned when he saw Dan and Emily enter. “What can I get ya?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“You can get us out of here!” Dan snapped at him. “This isn’t right… we aren’t donkeys!!!”He protested.<br />
<br />
“Well you should have thought of that before you came here and started acting like stupid animals.” The man laughed. “Some time ago we stopped taking boys to the island because we discovered that the girls can act more like asses than the boys, so their transformation is faster and purer. The girls don&#39;t even realize their changes.” The bartender pointed at Emily though was deep in thought looking over the available beers. <br />
<br />
“But sometimes some boys like you sneak into the boat with the girls. But it does not matter, they end up being part of the herd.” Continued the man with a malevolent smile.<br />
<br />
“Hey Baaaaaawwww-heeee-hawwww!” Loud braying echoed from across the room where a naked black haired girl covered in gray fur with a huge belly was raising her empty mug.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me.” The tender grinned at Dan and headed over to refill the bowl in front of the donkey girl. The man came back.<br />
<br />
“I can’t decide!” Emily complained.<br />
<br />
“Emily, there’s ONE choice, we’re getting dumber! We need to get out of here before you end up like that!” Dan jabbed a finger at the corner where a jenny was drinking from a trough of beer. The animal had a green hoodie stretched around the front of its body, a front leg through each sleeve, the back ripped open. Jeans and panties were stretched over its rear end, ripped down the middle, exposing the furry butt and tail swishing over it.<br />
<br />
“Uh Huh.” Emily wasn’t paying attention anymore. “Can you decide for me?” She asked the bartender. <br />
<br />
He grinned at her. “Why I do believe I can, little jenny.” He said, filling up a mug of beer. He then filled up a second. “Now you and your jack drink up, you hear? Then you’ll be ready for more fun.” He looked her over, “Maybe you two should go down the River Cave ride, you could imagine it is a tunnel of love ride.”<br />
<br />
“WhaAAAAAW HEEEE-HAW!” Emily put a hand over her muzzle. She looked terribly embarrassed. “What is special about that place?”<br />
<br />
“Take your jack down it and find out.” The bartender said with a wink. “Trust me, you’ll love it.” <br />
<br />
Emily felt like she could trust him. She took a sip from her mug.<br />
<br />
“Emily no! It’s the beer!” Dan suddenly realized, but it was too late, a ridiculous smile spread over Emily’s equine lips. He shook her, but she looked utterly content. <br />
<br />
“Emily!!! Snap out of it! We aren’t donkeys!” <br />
<br />
Emily ignored her jack and resumed drinking. He hadn’t touched his beer, if he wouldn’t then eventually she would drink it. For now though all she wanted to do was drink.<br />
<br />
 “No...no...no...”Emily snorted. “Stubborn ass!”<br />
<br />
“Emily, we have to-mppppppf!” Emily pressed the mug of beer into Dan’s lips, and he swallowed it.<br />
<br />
“HEEEEE-HAWWWWW!” Burst out of Dan as the beer flowed down him. He coughed and sputtered, not ready for it, but after he calmed down, a huge smile was plastered on his rubbery lips.<br />
<br />
“Feel better?” Emily asked, looking very tipsy herself. Her groin was beginning to press against her pants. Not in the same shape as Dan though, much smaller and only now starting to grow out. <br />
<br />
“You smell better. You smell really good too!” Dan said enthusiastically. There was a clang and Dan looked down to see a bowl of beer in front of him. He put his face in it without a thought and started sucking the beer down. <br />
<br />
The bartender chuckled and went to tend to another donkey girl. Dan finally finished and sat up. “BUUUUHBBELLLLCH!” He burped loudly. “Feeling much better. Let’s go Emily!” He said grabbing her hand and pulling her up.</p>
