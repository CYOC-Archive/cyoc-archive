<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec got up the next morning feeling oddly groggy, and pulled himself up to go get to the bathroom and clear the sleep from his eyes fully. What he saw gave him a stark moment of pause. He saw himself, but definitely more muscular, definitely more tanned of all things, and slightly taller it seemed. He stared at himself in the mirror, any hint of sleep or drowsiness fleeing from his consciousness. He felt words get caught in his throat. The teenage athlete felt with uneasy hands the muscular build he&#39;d never seen before.<br />
<br />
He was appalled at the tan, thought it made him look menial, but the more he looked at himself the more he started to kind of at least think well of the muscles. Alec had been working on trying to buff up, and he guessed this was fulfilling that. Kind of. The young man also did not care for the way his lips looked. Did he eat something spicy outside of his immediate memory? Yeah, yeah that explained it plenty.<br />
<br />
Alec swore it was probably just the result of running around outside so much for his practice for school athletics. Yeah that explained it nicely. He wasn&#39;t some lummox that looked like this from working...<br />
<br />
Deciding he needed to ignore this in the interest of making it to school on time, Alec jumped into the shower and familiarized himself with his new peaks and valleys, much as he disliked the tan at least the muscles would function well enough for his needs. His girlfriend would definitely like em. Alec groaned when he felt his manhood thicken and arouse from its own slumber, swearing he&#39;d need to take a pitstop at break time to take care of that.<br />
<br />
After washing off and getting rid of any soap from his hair, he noted his hair was feeling kind of more curled in certain few spots. He shrugged and decided he could investigate later. Alec was a straight A student and he needed to get to school and preserve that. His usual clothes for today were a little tighter than usual, and Alec supposed that was due to the sudden onset muscular growth that had happened. He figured it would be a good look anyway and so swaggered downstairs wearing a white polo shirt with a pocket, jeans that nicely hugged his thick muscular ass, and shoes he&#39;d sworn he&#39;d only need to use in a few years.<br />
<br />
Finding himself eating much more than usual, Alec decided he was evidently a growing boy and so just leaned into it and finished up a full six plates worth of food. His mind at ease from the influx of protein and carbohydrates from eggs, bacon, bread, and numerous other foods, he grabbed up his backpack and headed out.<br />
<br />
School was not far, and in the day he didn&#39;t have much worry in his mind about getting attacked by those thugs.<br />
<br />
He found himself walking with much more confidence among his classmates, a cocky, indulgent sneer evident on his face. Usually he kept to his crowd of equally racist friends, but now he was mixing and cohabitating with everyone else. Alec decided it was so that he could best show off his new build and demonstrate its good qualities to the local girls, which reminded the young athlete he needed a date for the upcoming dance.<br />
<br />
Finding himself hobnobbing again with a few of his friends on the way into the main campus, one of them, Spencer, asked him in a pointed tone, &quot;Have you been...tanning, Alec? And what&#39;s with your hair? Are you going for a more exotic look? If so, don&#39;t. It&#39;s not a good---&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec turned and scowled at him, &quot;I think I look plenty good, dough boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kincaid, another of them, chuckled at this display - few of them could stand Spencer, and even though it was crude it was appreciated, &quot;Still man, best hold off on the runs and the time spent traipsing around. You might end up looking---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking what?&quot; Alec asked in a flippant way, not even caring for the moment, &quot;Even better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like one of them.&quot; Was all Kincaid said, and he walked off with Spencer after that.<br />
<br />
Alec was left pondering this, was he starting to look like--- He shook his head. Alec decided he was just looking different and the other guys had not gotten used to it yet. Sure it made him look different but that didn&#39;t mean he was some fucking black guy. He was white as can be. Alec strode off, putting his friends and their little commentary on his looks out of his mind and out of consideration. Besides, now it was time for his favorite class.<br />
<br />
He entered class and took a seat near the back.<br />
<br />
This was Miranda Fresne&#39;s class for English II, and she was one of the teachers who it seemed appreciated him quite a bit, and when she saw him today it seemed she outright swooned. It was frowned upon to indulge in such things with the student body, but with the kind of money Alec and his family had, some rules were made to be bent if not broken. He didn&#39;t rank her as a girlfriend or anything, and she made it obvious theirs was a dalliance of desire, not of commitment. His seat was very uncomfortable when he went to sit down, noting the chair was an ill fit for his glutes and there was insufficient room down there for his legs, as muscled and bulked up as they were.<br />
<br />
He wondered if he could get some kind of new seating arrangement. Alec was already fidgeting when class began and Ms. Fresne began collecting homework. He of course had bought the loyalty of a local nerd and had him do the work, which he promptly turned in.<br />
<br />
She turned on the TV for the student run news program, and Alec rolled his eyes. It was usually cringeworthy and he was already rolling his eyes as it started. Maybe today something would be different.</p>
