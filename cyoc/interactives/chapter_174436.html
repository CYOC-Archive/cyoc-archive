<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris sat in silence and stared at his sister. What she had explained, about him becoming a girl, not about Aimee breaking her leg, seemed the most insane, idiotic thing he&#39;d ever heard. Chuckling, a dry sound with no humour behind it, he said, &quot;You&#39;re crazy,&quot; and taking a drink of water, he stated, &quot;There&#39;s no way I could become a girl. Well, not a believable one. And certainly not by tonight when your game is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, it&#39;s the Amulet of Zulo, the thing I found,&quot; Tanya retorted, stung by her brother&#39;s words and standing, she told him, &quot;Here. I&#39;ll show you,&quot; before heading back to her room.<br />
<br />
Chris, after he&#39;d downed the last of his water, called out, &quot;Show me how? Are you going to use it on yourself?&quot; and when he got no response, he went and put his empty glass in the sink and headed back to his sister&#39;s room, stating, &quot;This I got to see. You showing me. What. You going to turn yourself into a guy?&quot; as he went.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid,&quot; his sister snapped as he stopped in the doorway and indicating to the computer screen, she told him, &quot;Here. Read this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The easy-going look he usually had on back, Chris stepped inside his sister&#39;s room. Crossing to her desk, he sat down before the Mac and began reading the print on the screen. When he finished, his sister pulled up another two sites and directed him to look at them as well. Scanning the information, one pretty much stating what the first had said, whilst the other claimed the Amulet of Zulo was cursed, Chris leaned back after he&#39;d finished. Looking at Tanya, he smiled and in what he hoped was a serious tone, &quot;Okay, Ms Newman. You have my attention. So how do we know this is going to work? And what happens if this thing disappears, like the websites claim. I&#39;m not getting stuck as a girl. And then there&#39;s the question of what I get out of it. I mean, it seems fair that if I have to be a girl, I should ask for something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tanya, who had figured her brother would ask for something in return, worried her lip as she sat down on the chair in front of her vanity and thought. After a moment, she adopted the same tone as her brother and replied, &quot;I guess, Mr Newman,&quot; a slight smile crossed each of them at the private joke that they still shared, &quot;we&#39;ll just have to take our chances. If one of us keeps an eye on the necklace, we can make sure it hasn&#39;t vanished. As for what you get out of it, what would you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
A mischievous smile appeared on her brother&#39;s face and he stated, &quot;I want you to become a guy,&quot; and seeing the look on his sister&#39;s face and that she was about to protest, he held up his hand and said, &quot;Not right now. But at a later date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unhappy with the thought of having to be a boy, Tanya furrowed her brow. After a moment, she decided it seemed fair that if her brother had to become a girl, she would have to become a guy. Sticking out her hand, she announced, &quot;Deal,&quot; and as they shook, Chris asked, &quot;So how does this work?&quot; before indicating to the Mac and stating, &quot;This sites say you need like an article of clothing or something belonging to the person. So, no offense, I am not wearing anything of yours. And I really do not like the idea of becoming someone else. I mean, I might be over thinking this, but there seems to be so much that can go wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I might have an idea of what to do,&quot; Tanya said as she stood and started out of her room.<br />
<br />
Following after her, Chris inquired, &quot;Oh?&quot; and as the two of them headed toward the front of the house, Tanya asked him, &quot;How much money do you have on you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris, who hadn&#39;t expected this, stopped midstride and glared at his sister. After a moment, he crossed his arms over his front and in a defensive voice asked, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I need to get a few things and I figure that you could help contribute,&quot; Tanya explained and seeing the look on her brother&#39;s face, she sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll pay you back, if that is really what you want,&quot; before starting to look for her sandals, then remembing that she had kicked them off in her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Chris said before he turned and headed for his room.<br />
<br />
Not intending to give her all the money he had set aside, Chris fetched from under his bed the lockbox he kept whatever money he had on hand in. Opening it, he ignored the change and counted out the bills. Finding he had close to 89 dollars, he knew if he bothered to count the coins it would bring it closer to 92 or 93. Counting out thirty, hoping it would be enought for whatever Tanya had planned, he slide the lockbox back under his bed, hid it under some odds and ends, then stuffed the ten and two fives in his pocket.<br />
<br />
Outside in the hall, he ran into Tanya, who was slipping her feet into her sandals. Tempted to tell her he was coming with, Chris instead fished the money from his shorts pocket and said, &quot;Here&#39;s what I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. I promise, I&#39;ll pay you back half of what I spend, all right?&quot; Tanya said as she took the money.<br />
<br />
A nod from her brother and Tanya told him, &quot;Be back in a bit,&quot; before heading out, leaving her brother standing in the hall, wondering what exactly he had just gotten himself in before, slowly and as if in a dream, he headed back outside. Picking up the basketball he had left in the grass, he went and sat down on the stoop, thinking about what he sister wanted.</p>
