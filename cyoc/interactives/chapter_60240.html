<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Master Equus was not happy as he stepped through the portal to Glendale. A damn problem, and a serious one at that. He forced himself to be calm as he approached Stripes. She had not dis-obeyed any orders as he had given none on the subject. Never in his wildest imagination did he think it would be an issue.<br />
<br />
Mul had called on his cell ten minutes after he and Fries came through talking about bovine imps in the next building. He admitted that he didn’t know the full story except that Stripes had claimed them.<br />
<br />
Bovines were never part of the plan. They tended to not be the brightest bulbs in the chandelier, and to want things their way. Equus had decided that he could just not afford that kind of ignorance and stubbornness while fighting Ponius. Now Stripes not only created bovines, but imps! Demons with malicious child-like minds! The gods only know what sort of havoc they might touch off!<br />
<br />
What ensued between Equus and Stripes was more than a discussion and less than an interrogation. She was very open and claimed full responsibility for what she had created. The humans had been in a position to cause trouble, and they had a history with Jennifer, the girl who had become Stripes.<br />
<br />
Once Equus heard the full story he calmed completely. At least her motives made total sense. Revenge was a demon’s prerogative, and this had definitely been served with the proper degree of chill and superior imagination. Still, it did nothing to solve the immediate crisis. The operation was behind schedule, and Equus had to expose himself by coming to Glendale. <br />
<br />
“Stripes, I’m not mad at you. You didn’t break any orders, and you handled a possible threat. “ Equus sighed as he looked into Stripe’s eyes. “This is an order, no more imps, no more bovines. Keep any more corruptions equine.”<br />
<br />
Stripes looked down at the ground. “Understood Master.”<br />
<br />
“Now you better take me to your twins so I can fix things as much as they can be fixed.”<br />
<br />
Stripes lead Equus out of the stables over to the large darkened dairy barn. Husky child-like voices could be heard coming from one of the pens along with some excited mooing and occasional giggling. It didn’t take long to find the twin imps. <br />
<br />
They had taken rope and tied two cows to a feeding trough by their horns in an effort to keep them from moving. The imps were standing on hay bales and doing their best to mate the cows with their adult sized bovine cocks. Both imps were thrusting and mooing when they weren’t giggling, playfully poking each other, and mussing each other’s manes.<br />
<br />
“Mom! Look at us! We’re breeding bulls!” Bart announced cheerfully. <br />
<br />
Both imps thrust and  let rip with loud moos as they came inside their bovine partners. Glowing red eyes showed that any human drinking milk from these cows would likely wind up imps themselves.<br />
<br />
“That’s great guys.” Stripes sounded very sheepish. She had seen the scowl on the half-muzzle of Master Equus. “Bart and Billy, this is my boss Master Equus.”<br />
<br />
“Hi there.” Equus did his best to sound friendly but he doubted it was convincing.<br />
<br />
“Can we pull your tail and ride you boss horsey?”, asked Billy.<br />
<br />
“Please?”, intoned Bart.<br />
<br />
“No”, was all Equus said. His voice not quite a growl.<br />
<br />
“Behave or I’ll spank you! Get off those hay bales and get over here! Now!” Stripes was plainly worried at this point. Fortunately both imps obeyed immediately and stood next to her.<br />
<br />
Equus looked at the situation. He could not leave things as they were or his careful plans would explode in his face. Whether stripes liked it or not these two were destined to become bovine lust demons. Whether he liked it or not he was going to have to mate these cows to make it work. These cows would be imp factories if  their taint was left as is.<br />
<br />
“Imps, you will obey my every order. I am your master.” This was a spell, not a statement from Equus. “Stand here. Do nothing. Say nothing until I order you otherwise!” <br />
<br />
The twin’s eyes glazed over. “Yes Master Equus”, they chorused robotically.<br />
<br />
A smile crept across the face of Equus. At least these impertinent junior bulls wouldn’t give him any more trouble today. “Stripes, I want you back on the road to stop number four. Amy is in charge at the ranch, and Carl is already awaiting your portal. I don’t want to distract Fries and Mul, I will take care of this mess here personally.”<br />
<br />
“But Master, I can….” Stripes started hopefully.<br />
<br />
“You can get your tail on the road and follow orders! Now go!” Equus followed up the command with a snort and a hoof stomp for emphasis. Stripes got the message and left quietly. <br />
<br />
Equus jumped the pen’s fence. He gave a neigh of disgust and started stroking his massive equine cock. He coated the vulva of the first cow with a load of pre and slammed his cock into the hapless animal. It bellowed in protest and tried to kick Equus, but he was too fast on his hooves. Equus retaliated by lashing out with his own hoof wounding the animal’s udder. The wounded cow bellowed in pain, but was helpless to do anything more as it was impaled on the equine demon’s shaft.  Equus mumbled a spell and shot a load of tainted cum into the beast, then forcefully pulled out with a neigh of triumph. <br />
<br />
The beast slipped and fell, it’s hindquarters slamming the ground with a crash and a bellow. A loud snap was heard as the animal’s neck broke thanks to the handiwork of the imps.<br />
<br />
The imps stood in stunned silence as the cow’s body lay before them.<br />
<br />
“Now imps, you will find that I am very fair and can be a great friend.” Equus paced around behind the second cow, his erect cock swaying. “Oppose me, betray me, attack me and you will wind up like this unfortunate pile of meat on the ground. Make no mistake, I am in charge. Do you understand and agree? Answer now.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,”, both imps said quietly. Their demeanor said that the spell was no longer required to keep them in line.<br />
<br />
“Good. You may not remember, but you were not imps before your mom adopted you. I am going to give you both a gift. I will make you full demons. In return you will swear fealty to me.  You will be in charge of your race and will own this property, but you will answer to me and only me. Do you pledge to honor this arrangement? Answer now, and truthfully. The spell that binds you will not let you lie.”<br />
<br />
There was silence for a few minutes as each of the imps processed the information. Finally Billy answered in a husky child-like voice. “Make me a full demon and I will swear eternal allegiance to you Master Equus.”<br />
<br />
Bart nodded slowly, “I too swear my eternal allegiance to you Master Equus.”<br />
<br />
Equus nodded, “I accept your allegiance and will fulfill my promise now.” Equus spoke calming words into the ear of the second cow and stroked it’s neck. He reached out and untied the ropes securing it’s head to the feeding trough. Equus  lead it a few feet away from it’s fallen sister. The cow licked the hand of Equus and he stroked it’s flanks as he got in mating position. He lubed the cow’s vulva and entered her slowly. After five short minutes of mating and another spell he shot his own tainted cum into the creature. He then pulled out gently.<br />
<br />
Darkness seemed to envelop the cow. It’s fur turned all black. It was now specially tainted. It turned and licked the cock of Equus who neighed in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Imps, I order you both to nurse from the udder of this cow. If a teat runs dry you will move on to the next one. You will both keep nursing until this cow is out of milk. Once that is complete you will report to me next door in the stable building. When your growth completes I will release the spell of binding that controls your actions, and we will see what needs to be done to place this property in your control. Start nursing boys, you have serious growing to do.”<br />
<br />
The imps scrambled to get under the tainted cow to nurse as Equus strode from the building to the adjacent stable. Pleasant sounds and scents of equine sex wafted through the air. Equus stroked his cock bringing it to full hardness. He planned to do some mating himself as long as he was here. He waved to Fries and Mul who were hard at work breeding. <br />
<br />
He entered the stall next to Fries and bred the willing philly he found there. As his taint shot into his equine partner he wondered at the fact that Ponius and his crew had not tried to join this little party. Little did he know that Ponius was up to his tail in his own problems thanks to his apprentice Kyle, his dildo who insisted on being called Horse, and ten very powerful warrior demons…..</p>
