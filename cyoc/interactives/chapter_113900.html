<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Outside of the scare of going into lock-down in the morning, which Martha still didn&#39;t know why they&#39;d gone into lock-down,  the morning at Moon Lake Junior High went fairly well. Many of the students were fairly respectful, though Martha didn&#39;t know if that was because Kat was still there or because they liked her, but in the end, it worked and Martha gained some confidence. Doing well allowed her practice the various measures and lessons she&#39;d been studying to get her certification back, even if she would be at the Elementary level. Coach Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Johnson also proved to be a great help and guide, letting the two of them begin to form a fairly decent friendship.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;d prefer to take the a position at the elementary?&quot; Kat asked as the two women settled down to lunch in Kat&#39;s office, &quot;You&#39;ve done fairly well here at the Junior High.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve learned a lot, even if only in two days,&quot; Martha replied, &quot;but the elementary level is where I&#39;m best academically. Besides, I don&#39;t want to force anyone out of a job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha made that point because of the fact that she was serving as a substitute for Kat&#39;s normal assistant coach. Kat seemed to recognize this and nodded. Martha watched as the weretigress gave a knowing smile, even while still in her human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... so long as we stay friends... that&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Kat smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends with benefits,&quot; Martha replied with a smile of her own.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d already learned that Kat was a lesbian and was attracted to her. It had been something of a surprise to Martha, as they had only just met, but on many levels Martha didn&#39;t mind. It had proved to be enjoyable as Martha continued to embrace being bisexual and being a werecat, making her feel far more whole than she ever had. And even as she drank from the milk cartoon, thoughts of the fun they&#39;d had the day before flashed through Martha&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... would you be up for some more fun this afternoon?&quot; Kat asked as took  bite from the school lunch she had.<br />
<br />
Martha wanted to say yes, as the previous day had been fun. She opened her mouth to say &quot;yes,&quot; but nothing came out as memories Eric&#39;s questions of her and William the previous evening had also come up. While Eric seemed fine with the arrangement that she and William had arranged for their newly open marriage, she did realize that it had came as a surprise to Eric and he had sounded genuinely fearful that she might go off just to have sex with other women. Talking with Eric had helped with those fears, but then there was still Nate to consider. He&#39;d seemed okay with certain aspects of things when Martha had brought Nellie home after their surprise reunion when Martha had gone to get the clothing she was now wearing to serve as an assistant gym coach, but remembering Eric&#39;s uncertainties regarding Kat made her think of something in the tone that Nate had when she reintroduced him to Nellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to,&quot; Martha answered after a moment, &quot;but I think there are a few family matters to take care of... The &quot;open marriage&quot; that my husband and I are under right now is new and has caught my sons by surprise. Eric came home and confronted me on... on you yesterday evening...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t...&quot; Kat wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things are fine,&quot; Martha raised a hand to assure Kat that things were fine, &quot;but both William and I had to explain some things to him... something we really didn&#39;t get to do with our older son, Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you wish to talk to your son... or sons?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;let them know that our marriage ISN&#39;T danger or anything remotely like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kat said slowly. She didn&#39;t fully understand the concerns over an open marriage, though she&#39;d had to admit that as a lesbian who&#39;d never had a long term partner the way Samantha and Frances Twist had each other dealing with children as a parent had never come up in her life. And as a single woman, whom she slept with wasn&#39;t or at least shouldn&#39;t be the concern of her students so long as it remained outside school hours and off school premises. However, Kat wasn&#39;t going to force herself on anyone and if Martha had family business, it&#39;d be best to let Martha handle that business.<br />
<br />
Martha, meanwhile, watched Kat&#39;s eyes drift down toward her desk and her lunch as they ate. It sounded a little bit depressed and looked as though Kat was trying to avoid eye contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Martha asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Kat answered. &quot;I&#39;m just not used to dealing with family issues from a parental role. I was the only &quot;child&quot; in the Johnson family... adopted or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be challenging and rewarding all at the same time,&quot; Martha told her, &quot;just as teaching is. I&#39;d have thought this was something you&#39;d have at least some familiarity with. I mean... you are quite beautiful... wouldn&#39;t you have attracted someone you could spend your life with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve found those that would be willing for some occasional fun.... but real love has been a bit more difficult,&quot; Kat said slowly, &quot;most weretigers are heterosexual and many smaller weres tend to be a bit timid around me as a weretiger with the fear that I&#39;d be a bit rough on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t rough with me,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And many that I&#39;ve had fun with did learn that,&quot; Kat nodded, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean that anything quite like what you and your husband have. No great bond or anything beyond some fun ever formed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha chewed on her lunch and let Kat finish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I&#39;ll find someone eventually,&quot; Kat then finished, &quot;but for the moment... I haven&#39;t found that special woman who is simply the only one for me, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when that does happen,&quot; Martha said slowly and taking Kat&#39;s free hand in her own, &quot;and you and your wife have adopted children for the two of you to raise and they wonder about your relationship... be it because it&#39;s open or because they don&#39;t understand same sex relationships... you&#39;ll understand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Kat gave a soft chuckle as Martha texted a message to Nate on her phone.</p>
