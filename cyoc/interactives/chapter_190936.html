<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan was bewildered with the latest news, especially with how that weathergirl just pooped her pants like that on live television. For her whole life, she was told to always be a big girl and that only babies poop in their pants like that. Although she had a couple friends that were bedwetters when she was in grade school, it wasn’t common for her peers to wear diapers like that. Before the incident happened, she was even thinking about trying to potty train Zion. “This is sooo… unexpected. It’s like I’m in the Twilight Zone.” She thought to herself. “I wonder how Zion is going to react seeing me as a baby?” She wondered as she thought it was best for her to check up on him, making sure that he’s safe after what happened.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Zion woke up in his crib not long after. His room was surrounded by cute looking stuffed animals in his crib like his big Plusle and Minun plushies and his stuffed bear, along with the walls being painted white. There were also some pictures of children’s book characters that were hung up on the wall. As he was a toddler before the worldwide event happened, he still thinks everything is normal according to his point of view. Despite gaining adult like intelligence from what happened last night, he still saw things the same way as he did before due to only being two years old.  <br />
<br />
It didn’t took as long for Megan to enter his room in a happy mood. “Good morning, Buddyboo.” She said in a cheerful voice as Zion was shocked on how his mother somehow looked like a baby like him suddenly. “Mommy?” He said. “Yes sweetie, I’m your mommy. I know this seems different but everything will be okay.” Zion looked at her for a little bit before his stomach started growling. “Mommy, I’m hungry.” He said to her. “Okay sweetie, I’ll get you of your crib so you could go downstairs.” Megan then toddled towards the front of the crib before she realized that she wasn’t tall enough to get Zion over it anymore.<br />
<br />
She then looked around a plastic stool with bright colors as she dragged it towards his crib and stepped on it. “Alright sweetie, I want you to hold onto my hand.” Zion pondered on why his mom needed to use the stepping stool he used at times to carry him before he carefully got out it and stepped on his stepping stool. “Good job.” Megan said in a cheery voice. “Yay, now we can get breakfast.” Zion then tried to waddle out of the room before Megan noticed something about his walk. “Zion, do you need a change before we go downstairs?” She asked him. “No, it’s just warm.” He responded. <br />
<br />
“Yep, sounds like you need a diaper change.” Zion pouted as she said that sentence. “But I’m hungry.” He complained. “We will get breakfast as soon as you get your diaper changed. Besides, you don’t want a leaky diaper. Do you?” To Zion, leaky diapers don’t sound like fun. So, he obliged with his mother’s request. “No.” He then tried to get up on his changing table, except he was too tall for it. Given that Megan was now as tall as his son, she had no choice but to use the changing mat from Zion’s diaper bag that was in her bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere before I return, okay?” Megan told him before he adorably responded with an okay. Shortly after, Zion wandered around his bedroom where he opened his closet and played around with some of the clothes that were in there. As Megan got back with her diaper bag, she saw Zion with a bunch of his shirts lying around the floor. “Zion, sweetie. Those clothes are not for playing.” Megan said as Zion stopped playing as he saw her. <br />
<br />
“Okay, now I want you to lie around the rug.” Zion then went on the floor before Megan put a changing mat there. He lied there as his mom took off his pajama pants and undid the tabs of his diaper. “Wow, looks like someone was soaking wet.” She commented after seeing his diaper being droopy with urine. She removed his dirty diaper and wiped his butt before applying a new diaper on him with some baby powder. <br />
<br />
“There we go.” Megan said as she was done putting in Zion’s new diaper before waddling next to some of the clothes that he was playing with earlier. “Alright then, which shirt do you want to wear for today?” Zion then pointed to a shirt that has a couple characters from Octonauts on them, given that he loves the show. Afterwards, Megan took off his pajama shirt and put his Octonauts shirt on him. “Aww, you look so cute with that shirt. My little sailor.” Zion giggled at her comment.<br />
<br />
“Okay, now let’s go to the bathroom so we can go brush your teeth.” Zion frowned. “But I want to eat breakfast.” He pouted. “First, we have to brush your teeth. Then, we could go downstairs to have breakfast.” Megan insisted, despite Zion being impatient. “I promise you Buddyboo that we’ll go downstairs after we brush your teeth.” Zion sighed as Megan hold his hand and went their way to the bathroom.<br />
 <br />
As they got there, the bathroom remained the same prior to the incident except for the toilet that disappeared. Since the sink was too tall for them, Megan went back to Zion’s room before getting his stepping stool and bringing it to the bathroom. For a brief moment, Zion looked around the space where the toilet used to be. He didn’t really know what the true intent for toilets was as he did his business in his diapers. Zion curiously played with the toilet paper before Megan came back with the stepping stool. “Alright sweetie, it’s time to brush.” She stopped as she saw Zion playing with the roll of toilet paper, as it was all over the floor. Some of it was wrapped around him.<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh, you look so adorable. Let me get my phone.” Megan toddled her way to her bedroom to get her phone. But when she opened the door, she found it interesting with how it has changed.</p>
