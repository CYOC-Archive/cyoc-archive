<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hugo stepped off the bus with a pensive look on his face. Shadows covered him as he started moving toward the other side of the street despite the midday sun. A twenty-stories high office building overlooked the bus stop, with the words &quot;Richard and Son Inc&quot; front and center over the doors. <br />
<br />
Hugo mentally reviewed the information he&#39;d uncovered about Danny&#39;s father. Richard Thompson, self-made man, owned a few dozens factories around the country, with divisions in engineering and toy-making. Following the exam, Bruce&#39;s dicking and his selling of most of his successful dicking test subjects, he&#39;d contacted Richard. Danny had shown himself to be rather worried about what his father might say, especially after the exam. Well, Hugo had no problem trying to explain the situation to him. The man could become a key figure in his manipulations. <br />
<br />
Hugo&#39;s email had, of course, included Mint&#39;s subliminal messages. A simple hacking trick from his alien supercomputer had looped messages about open-mindedness about new technological advancements and lowered physical agression throughout the man&#39;s screen for the three days it had taken to get a rendezvous scheduled. He would not be close-minded about the more unusual aspects of the situation. <br />
<br />
The doors opened with a hiss of compressed air, and Hugo immediately felt the nice, cool air conditioning hit his skin. Quite refreshing. In his pocket, he felt Danny shift and shiver. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay in there?&quot; he asked, rubbing the cold penis and helping his blood circulate again. <br />
<br />
He suspected that the cold wasn&#39;t the only reason however. Ever since they&#39;d gotten on the bus, Danny&#39;s reactions had grown more subdued. Like he was anticipating a disaster. There was some merit to the fear. After all, on campus, the various male students had completely accepted the various cocks that were their former classmates. Danny himself was often taken out by George to have fun with the guys, and a few guys had apparently said they were even envious. It was getting to the point that Hugo was considering handing out low-powered copies of his dicking camera, just to see the resulting dicking spree. <br />
<br />
They got onto the elevator silently, waiting as the cheesy music played out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, Hugo?&quot; Danny asked, perking up against Hugo&#39;s palm. &quot;Do I have to turn back into a man? Can&#39;t I just stay a dick? It&#39;s grown on me, to be honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo carefully kept his excitement out of his expression. One more success in his experiment! He put a mental checkmark on his list to fill in some more documentations to send to his superiors. At the rhythm he was going, they would never force him to stop his experiment. &quot;Well, there might be some logistical issues, but I don&#39;t see why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my dad&#39;s...&quot; Danny trailed off, shrinking further. His dickhead was almost hiding in his ballsack. <br />
<br />
It took some stroking to get him a little bigger. It wouldn&#39;t do to show Danny at his least impressive. The warmth of his fingers seemed to be doing the trick, as were soft words in a low voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a shame.&quot; Hugo nodded. &quot;But I am sure that he can be convinced if you believe that&#39;s the best thing for you. Tell you what? I have an idea on what could be done to give you more time to find good arguments to convince your father. But you have to promise not to interrupt, otherwise I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll be able to remain a dick forever. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny couldn&#39;t stop himself from drooling precum all over Hugo&#39;s fingers at the thought. He simply nodded, as best as his cock body could bob as he started to stiffen.<br />
<br />
The elevator pinged and the doors opened. At the front desk, the secretary allowed Hugo in, not noticing the bulge in his pocket. Luckily, else he might have stopped Hugo cold for such broadlight perversions. Bringing a dildo to a business meeting? What madness! He might have even confiscated the thing... for his own personal use.<br />
<br />
Richard&#39;s office was a testament to the man he was: sober, modern, sharp. Black and greys used in abundance, with a few drawers full of sensitive files that were best not digitalize and a large clear window with a view of the city behind him. Richard had only just entered his fifties, but looked nearly a decade younger, with well-toned arms and a full graying beard. <br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Hugo?&quot; Richard asked, shaking Hugo&#39;s hand and getting some of the &#39;fluid&#39; on it. He didn&#39;t seem to notice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Correct. You are Richard Thompson, Danny&#39;s father?&quot; he replied, sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was slightly worried when I read your emails. You said Danny was &#39;affected but not harmed&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo nodded and plunged a hand in his pocket. &quot;I believe you will understand immediately what I meant by that if I show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Hugo pulled out Danny at full mast and placed him on top of the desk, pointing at his father. Despite himself, Danny&#39;s balls clenched from the sight, from arousal or fear, he himself did not know.<br />
<br />
Danny cleared his &#39;throat&#39;. &quot;Hey, Dad. How&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard, even with the subliminal influence, stared with wide eyes at the erect cock on his desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;D-Danny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, Richard, Danny and I were at the same party, and I accidentally brought out a very advanced nanophoto device instead of my camera. We had a few drinks and the result is what you see. Now, Danny is his own cock. He is very healthy, without any need for food, air or water. Though some artificial subsitutes help with a few, ahem, &#39;functions&#39;. The most prominent side-effect is a lack of autonomy. Cocks weren&#39;t made for moving on their own. Or talking. But thanks to a chip my friend developped, Danny&#39;s thoughts are transmitted to us as voiced out sentences.&quot; After a moment of pause, Hugo said, with little sincerity: &quot;I do apologize for this&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well,&quot; Richard laughed under his breath, &quot;I&#39;ve known my fair share of wild parties back in my days. I can&#39;t begrudge Danny for wanting to live out his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny twitched with hopes on the desk. &quot;R-really, Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s life, I suppose. I admit I&#39;m curious about this technology you speak of, but it can wait. How soon can you turn Danny back into a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny twitched, seemingly to answer, and Hugo jumped in: &quot;I&#39;m working on a way to fix it, Mister Thompson.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, Richard frowned. &quot;You&#39;re &#39;working&#39; on it? Do you not have a way to reverse it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, obviously. But by the way things were evolving, Hugo was starting to get tempted to destroy those methods and pretend they had never existed. Most men seemed unlikely to mind. And those that did, well... he had more than a few ways to persuade them that they really didn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
&quot;The device was only ever a prototype,&quot; Hugo lied shamelessly. &quot;Plus, there&#39;s been an accident at my lab. Some priceless research material was lost in that event. It might take months, maybe even years to go back to the way things were last week.&quot; <br />
<br />
Richard&#39;s hands gripped hard against the edge of his desk, quite close from Danny&#39;s dickhead, who jolted from the sudden reaction. <br />
<br />
&quot;What if we were to collaborate?&quot; Richard offered, making visible efforts to control his temper. &quot;I assure you that ressources are not a problem for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m already working for another company, sir. It&#39;s a jealously guarded secret, you understand? It would be industrial spying to give you any information,&quot; Hugo said, a crafted response from his preliminary studying of the man. It was likely to provoke... <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, it&#39;s okay, I&#39;m-&quot; Danny started saying, only to cut himself short when his father abruptly stood and walked right up to the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what my father left me in his will?&quot; Richard asked, staring at the city. &quot;Nothing. He&#39;d barely paid off his debts by the time he had died. I had to scrounge up every penny I had to build this company. I swore I would leave my own son far more than my father ever could. I allied myself with repulsive businessmen because I knew they were dishonest bastards and they would do what it took to get us all rich. They&#39;re sharks, all of them. They won&#39;t accept this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny shrunk slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;All those sacrifices, and now my company is at a risk of never falling into my son&#39;s hands due to an accident of fate. I refuse that! Do you hear me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo remained silent. Inside, however, he was calculating all of Richard&#39;s possible reactions. Humans&#39; emotions could get them to act in incredibly contradictory ways, even counterproductive to their interest. He didn&#39;t fear being attacked, per say, due to Mint&#39;s subliminal suggestions. It would be a shame however if Danny&#39;s mentality regressed due to this encounter. He made a truly handsome cock when he was confident and relaxed. <br />
<br />
Maybe Hugo had a bit of a soft spot for his Number One Model.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do advise you not to act rashly, sir. One can adapt to this. I&#39;ve already drafted technological aids to allow Danny some freedom of movement.&quot; Things like drones and the apparatus that let him write and interact with computers. Not that he wanted to give many cocks their own drones. Most dicks had to learn their places first, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s already decided,&quot; Richard said with a harsh tone. &quot;You cannot change my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo braced himself. Worse came to worse, he would recondition Danny a bit and let George have his ways to give him some happiness back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That device you mentioned. I know you have it with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could not be thinking of stealing it, could he? <br />
<br />
Richard turned back to them and stared hard at Danny. Then, unexpectedly, he ran a hand over his shaft, like one would have run their hand through their child&#39;s hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Danny is not experienced enough to bring those men to heel if he&#39;s in such a vulnerable state,&quot; Richard said gently, then, he looked at Hugo full on and his resolve looked like pure steel, &quot;but I am. Dick me. That way I can prepare the way for my son. That way I will ensure that the company will go to him no matter what state he is left in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo blinked. That... was unexpected. He had not planned to dick Richard, in all honesty. It might have been moving too quickly. By all means, he should refuse, citing the dangers and such. He was only planning on getting Danny to stay a penis and perhaps send a few feelers. Such turnabout on their first meeting could only be a sign. <br />
<br />
Just like Richard had predicted, Hugo did have his dicking camera with him. It was the basis of his mission on Earth and he could not predict circumstances. What if he needed to dick someone on the spot, without planning, because everything was set up too perfectly for him not to take advantage of? <br />
<br />
Like a father wanting the best for his son, even if said son had been reduced to a nice, uncut dick. <br />
<br />
Hugo pressed the dicking flash, and the business suit fell to the ground the next second. Hugo made his way around the desk and picked Richard up to set him down next to Danny. <br />
<br />
Richard, as a cock, greatly resembled his son. Very slightly above average, cleanshaven, with large balls tightly clinging to the base of his saft. As Hugo examined him and memorized his stats, Richard began to drool precum. Just enough to puddle near Danny. One might not have believed Richard was middle-aged at all, based purely on his penis and his vitality. Hugo grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad,&quot; Danny began, choked up, &quot;you didn&#39;t have to do this. B-but you did. I love you, you&#39;re the greatest dad ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo, sensing the opportunity would never get better, rushed to install a speaker chip on under Richard&#39;s skin. This was bound to give him some amazing data on men&#39;s willingness to become dick and accept dicking as their natural state of being.</p>
