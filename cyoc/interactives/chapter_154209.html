<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew hadn&#39;t ordered anything that day, which made him a bit suspicious when he heard the sound of a truck speeding off after delivering him a box looking damn near identical to an Amazon delivery box. Andrew supposed it could be a consolation for another damn shitty day. The young nerd was 19 and in his first year of college - he&#39;d thought that college would be different, but no, no, the jocks were still the kings of the damn place. Except now they had even more shot at actual, lasting fame.<br />
<br />
Andrew was a skinny, tall blond young man, boyish in his face and near perpetually as young looking as he was at sixteen. Some people told him this was a blessing. He called it a curse and left it at that. It meant no woman or man could take him seriously, as far as he knew. Andrew was bisexual, and if someone assumed this meant he had more chances for sex, he&#39;d be quick to deny such an assumption. Andrew wore polo shirts, jeans and sneaker shoes, the typical ensemble for the moderately affluent upbringing he had.<br />
<br />
He grew up in the shadow of men bigger and better looking than him, who never had to put on glasses to see the board. And first and foremost among those guys was his current biggest antagonist, Brody Logan. Blessed with a height of six foot five, weighing in at about 230 lbs, Brody was nothing if not the dark haired, local college hunk - and correspondingly an utter twat to everyone not fitting his expectation of what a man was.<br />
<br />
It was these heavy thoughts that followed Andrew as he went about opening the box, hoping it would be some miracle or other to reverse his circumstances. He could hope at least - that much Brody couldn&#39;t take from him.<br />
<br />
He examined the strange little disc and quizzically turned it over, looking at it from every angle. He examined the disc&#39;s top, reading outloud, &quot;...Chronivac 6.0 huh...&quot; Andrew decided he might as well, and brought up his gaming laptop on to his bed to try this thing out. Upon sliding it in he swore he heard whirring and something activating. The screen went black near instantly for a moment...<br />
<br />
...And then loaded on to a blue and white checkerboard screen. He heard it loading something, and blushed bright red when the machine promptly displayed a 3D model of himself nude, down to every detail. He muttered, &quot;...And of course seeing myself like this brings out EVERY single flaw...&quot;<br />
<br />
He wondered what this was, and saw some menus show on the top of the screen. &quot;Hmm...&quot; Andrew pondered and looked at them, chuckling at some of the options. As if just a program could amplify the amount of muscle on someone...<br />
<br />
Just to see what this thing was, he went and added 20 lbs of muscle to his body, which would take him from 155 lbs sopping wet to 175 lbs and decently well muscled. Putting in 2 minutes for the duration of the change and making the changes &quot;permanent until specified&quot;, Andrew suddenly gasped as he felt a hot flash go over him. He almost fell off his bed, grunting and groaning as he felt something come up on him...<br />
<br />
He gasped as he watched his biceps - HIS BICEPS! - come to life, pulsing, growing, developing actual strength! He watched as they stopped growing at around 16.5 inches. Not as big as some of the sports guys, but definitely damn good. His chest ached and grew next, pressing out and making a flattering impression on the front of his shirt, and he groaned again as he felt his abdominals sculpt themselves more. Not a six pack yet, but he could feel the strength in his core.<br />
<br />
He stretched his legs as he felt his quads and thighs grow bigger and stronger, not by much but definitely enough to draw attention in shorts. Andrew got up and found himself adjusting his stance as his back grew wider and lats slightly bigger, shoulders broader than before.<br />
<br />
He found himself chuckling, then outright laughing as he felt his new body, running a hand across his newly formed, newly hardened muscles. &quot;It...I can&#39;t believe it, the Chronivac actually did this!&quot; He took a moment to flex for his room mirror. Not exactly the most impressive, but in comparison to his usual dumpy self? He&#39;d take it. &quot;Hm...what else can this thing do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The newly amplified man grinned a little and started looking through the Chronivac&#39;s options, &quot;Damn, orientation, chameleon clothes, race and all this stuff? Great deal...&quot;<br />
<br />
He realized upon looking further that his little device could change not just himself, but other people too. He could...<br />
<br />
The idea came to him in a flash. He could change that fucking Brody Logan. A satisfied smirk settled on Andrew&#39;s face and he loaded Brody&#39;s profile, wincing when he saw the full nude model of the jock. 9 inch dick, massive muscles all around...Andrew would feel some degree of lust for him if not for what an utter shithead Brody was. Guy just always got his way and let that go to his head.<br />
<br />
Looking at some of the more in depth info, Andrew noted Brody&#39;s sexuality was listed at 95% straight. He wryly remarked, &quot;With how that jackass is, I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s not 105%...&quot; This though gave Andrew an idea. Brody gave him hell over being bi, and was in general a bully and a scourge unto the LGBT students at the school. This was his chance to teach Brody a lesson in empathy. That he could be made to live in the shoes of those he&#39;d hurt and, maybe just maybe, apologize and try and be better.<br />
<br />
And step one to that...was changing Brody. Typing in some changes, he noted the duration had some additional options. He set things up so that every single day, Brody would get just five percent more gay on that little numerical spectrum, until he was the exact opposite ratio - 95% Gay, 5% Straight. He considered other stuff to do to Brody, but decided this was enough. Andrew started the transformation on Brody, and decided to head off to game and maybe - no, definitely - workout to maintain his new physique, and see how things were the next day at college.</p>
