“Hey Kat, how about we take Dan for a walk.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s a great idea Mom ! And on top of that, how about we give him one last chance. We let him outside with his briefs and if he poops in them, he becomes Toast permanently.”<br />
<br />
“Permanently?!” Dan shouted.” you can&#39;t do that to me, I don&#39;t wanna be a dog!” Dan squirmed against his restraints.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t kid yourself Dan, you know I know , and Mom knows you want to be a bitch. But if you really don’t wanna be a pup,you just can&#39;t poop yourself.” Kat smiles “But you can&#39;t go out completely naked like he needs his undies.” Kat snapped and suddenly Dan was no longer restrained. He looked down at his crotch , he had tighty whities on. “Oh ,a collar and leash too!” A purple collar suddenly poofed around Dan&#39;s neck. He reached up to it fiddling with the tag on it. A bone shaped tag with “Toast” engraved into it Times New Roman. Kat smugly looked down at her brother.”stand Toast it&#39;s time for walkies<br />
<br />
The conditions couldn&#39;t be more perfect. A warm day perfect for walking your dog around the block. Janice walked alongside Kat who was pulling Dan with the leash, still only wearing his underwear.  Dan was struggling , he thankfully was allowed to walk on his feet for now, but he was dealing with not only embarrassment but also his bowels.”Kat must&#39;ve done this, I didn&#39;t have to go before he thought.” <br />
<br />
“How are you holding up Toast?” Janice taunted. Dan shakily pointed a thumbs up prompting both girls to laugh.<br />
<br />
“I bet he’s getting ready to shit.” Kat sneered.”You ready to poop your panties Toasty?” <br />
<br />
“No…I’m not…cause I don&#39;t have to go” Dan shook.<br />
<br />
Kat gave an intrigued grin “Oh really , i guess my curse did not work properly , let&#39;s fix that”<br />
<br />
“W-Wait !” but it was too late, he felt the urge grow even stronger. He was hanging by a thread. “Just keep walking, Dan just keep waking” he thought to himself. Then he felt something approaching his rear.”Oh no, here it comes !” he thought. He braised himself for impact, however only a fart slipped out. He sighs in relief , but that relief was short-lived.<br />
<br />
“Oh my! Toasty! The stinker you are !” Kat teased,” are you sure you&#39;re not ready to go yet ? cuz it sure smells like you are.” Janice snickers and plugs her nose. Then, as if it could get worse , Dan felt a Pop ! in his thigh. “Hmm what was that ? sounds like someone&#39;s beginning to change.”<br />
<br />
“What !? but I haven&#39;t pooped in, that&#39;s not fair.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t have a cow Toast , you farted so you changed a teeny tiny amount . Just a spicy addition to the spell is all.” Kat Winked. Dan opened his mouth to protest but before he could even form words Kat interrupted him. “Shush Toast !” Dan , all of a sudden could not form words. No matter how much he tried. He was following the command ,  like a…<br />
<br />
“Hey!” suddenly a voice called from the other side of the street . “Janice ! over here !” They all looked over, it was the neighbors, they just so happened to be walking their dog at the same time.As they walked over Dan felt a load of shit push his bowel walls.”fuck fuck keep it together” he thought.” Well what do we have here ?”  the neighbors ask. <br />
<br />
“Oh just taking the dog out of the walkies is all &#39;&#39; Janice winked “Or soon to be ,I should say &#39;&#39; Janice ruffled Dan&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
“Soon to be you say ? Is Katty abusing her witch powers ?” <br />
<br />
“No no he wants this, i can assure you “ Kat stated proudly <br />
<br />
“Mhm i see , and what breed is this puppy of yours ?”<br />
<br />
“Well you remember Toasty right ? well she’s a big ol border collie” Dans heart sank, he forgot toasty was a girl. The neighbor&#39;s dog , a large German shepherd, looked at Dan with intrigue. Dan looked down at the large beast of a dog.”Oh no oh no oh no” he thought as the dog stood up to get close to Dan, sniffing at the bulge in the front of his underwear.<br />
<br />
“Seems they&#39;re already getting acquainted !” the neighbors laughed. The large dog then swung around to Dan&#39;s rear and started sniffing, much to Dan’s dismay. <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t sniff their poop, that&#39;s the stink zone,” Kat laughed. Dan was frozen , caught between this being the pinnacle or low point of his life. He simply sat there and took it feeling the wet dog nose pressed against his briefs. “Well they’ll be more aquined with each other soon I&#39;m sure.” Kat smiled.<br />
<br />
“True that.” said the neighbor “ Anyways we have to go , but it was nice seeing you guys we should have dinner soon.” the neighbor said as they walked away<br />
<br />
“If we do, bring your dog !” Janice yelled over to them. Then they resumed their walk. “I haven&#39;t spoken to them in a while , this day just keeps getting better.” Janice says with a smile. Dan was on the edge he couldn&#39;t take it anymore , but no he couldn&#39;t give up he had to fight, just imagine the hell that being a dog would bring , he would have diapers he would wear diapers in public and…on the other hand he would be anonymous no one would know its him. He would have no responsibilities, no tasks , nothing to do, nowhere to go. All he had to do was go for walks, play with a ball…and shit himself. Dan froze, stopping dead in his tracks. He was conflicted.”Toasty are you gonna go potty ?” <br />
<br />
“Uhhh…” Dan stammered out. Feeling his hole weakening.<br />
<br />
“Baking some chocolate cake Toast?” Kat sneered. Dan sighed,”Your name is Toast, You are a border collie , you don&#39;t use the bathroom , you use your pants.”blood rushed back down to his crotch, his thoughts persuaded him , and so… he let up just a bit. A loud wet fart rang out.<br />
“Mommy…” Dan said.<br />
<br />
“Yes Toast ?” <br />
<br />
“I&#39;m gonna go poopy”<br />
<br />
“Tsk tsk tsk , couldn&#39;t do it. Well, well, step into the grass Toasty. He did as he was told as he felt another bone pop. Then he stopped shaking , took a deep breath, and pushed. With a crackle he felt the turd slowly open his anal ring , then slidding in beween his cheeks.It felt huge like the biggest shit he’s ever taken. His mother moved a hand under Dan&#39;s ass to feel his load coming out. Then the brown monster started to scrape against his underwear. Kat squealed in delight. The turd bulged out pushing the fabric out. His erection grew pushing the other side of his underwear as several pounds of doggy fudge piled into his underwear. It just kept going making the bulge more and more obvious, turd followed turd with soft farts and fire like crackles, and the smell oh the smell…and then it was over. He felt the last of the shit exit him as satisfyingly.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that&#39;s the biggest shit I&#39;ve ever seen anyone take.”Kat said with a surprised expression.”I need to tune my spells.”  He took a breath, and tried looking over his shoulder. His underwear was filled, any more shit and it would be falling out the leg hole or over the waistband of his undies. At that moment he realized what he did and what he was doing. He was a waste, a porn addicted fag who just doomed himself to become a bitch. A bitch so useless it can even shit correctly. A big stinky pants shitting bitch. That&#39;s what he was becoming.<br />
<br />
Dan then felt the waistband of his undies being pulled back.”That&#39;s quite the load there Toast. Good girl,”Janice said, sapping the band back. Then both Dan&#39;s legs popped. He fell forwards onto all fours. his underwear was so full of shit they fell across his ankles. He felt a warmth slip over him and the balls in his feet shift around. He felt hair start growing on his feet ,his nails expanded and his toes shifted . ``It&#39;s happening,” he thought “I&#39;m becoming a dog.” Hair started to push from his ports as his bones re-arranged he felt an itchy sensation above his cracking bones. His spine unfused, pushing out into a fluffy white tipped duster. His cock started to shift colors and shrink, whittling down and opening up into a fresh dog cunt. He felt his hands pop shift just like his feet. The fur had encompassed him entirely from afar; he looked like a dog. But there was one more change left to go. Dan&#39;s hair was replaced with fur he felt it growing on his chin, on his cheeks, on the bridge of his nose. Then he felt his nose grow wet and begin to push, its cracks and pops his tongue followed the end of his mouth growing longer and more canine, then come to an end with one final pop. At that moment Dan ejaculated , downright exploded into the grass below using the last of his semen. It was over. Dan collapsed on the ground. He laid there on his side panting.<br />
<br />
“Toast…” Kat said the dog turned her head up to Kat “You stink” Kat smiles.”I know you wouldnt make it fag.” Dan simply ignored her and stood up on his paws. It&#39;s time to begin my new life</p>
