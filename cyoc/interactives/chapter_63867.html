<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You would have loved to continue to talk to the girls, trying to find out more about how the changes to reality have effected things, but your cellphone rings. A quick look at who's calling shows that it's your home phone and you remember that you were supposed to watch after your little sister while your parents have a night out.<br />
<br />
More than a little disappointed you answer the phone and tell your mom that you'll be going home as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
When you hang up Stacy sighs, &quot;That sucks. I was hoping that you'd spend the night with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tammy agrees, &quot;For a guy you're pretty cool. Stacy's so lucky to have ended up with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't get any ideas,&quot; Stacy playfully warns her friend while you excuse yourself to change out of your wet bathing suit. <br />
<br />
Once you're done getting dressed Megan offers to give you a ride home while Stacy and the others make dinner. You wish you were staying with them, but you know that it's not worth arguing with your mom, especially when she told you a week ago that you needed to babysit tonight.<br />
<br />
You notice that Megan keeps looking at you out of the corner of her eye as she drives.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; you ask playfully, having a pretty good idea.<br />
<br />
Megan blushes and looks away, brushing a hand across her flat chest, &quot;Sorry. Sometimes I just wonder what it's like to have breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny doesn't have breasts either,&quot; you remind her.<br />
<br />
This makes her giggle, &quot;You're right and she always says that she's glad not to have them, that they'd just get in the way when she's playing football. It's just that when I see guys like you and Gene who have great looking breasts I feel like I got the short end of the stick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since it was you who caused this situation by using the flashlight on her you feel a little bad. You want to do something, but you don't want to alert her to the fact that you have the light, even if she won't realize what it does. Recalling how once you used the light on her she was shirtless, you take a shot in the dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you had breasts you'd have to wear a bra and you wouldn't be able to go around shirtless,&quot; for good measure you quickly shine the light across her chest on its lowest, unnoticeable, blue setting which you figure will give her a slightly more athletic build without making her actually masculine.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; she says with a smile, &quot;I always did think that bras looked uncomfortable. And I guess I should be happy with who I am. I mean I know that Jenny and Tammy are happy with who they are, but I don't think I could handle looking as much like a guy as Jenny does or feel comfortable ... like Tammy is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; you agree with a small smile, &quot;Everyone is different, but all that matters is liking who you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
This marks the end of your conversation, for you're pulling into your driveway. Waving goodbye to Megan you go into your house. By the sounds of things your mom is in the bathroom getting ready and your dad is reading a story to your little sister since he won't be home in time to read her a bedtime story. You slip into your room and take out the flashlight. You've already figured the right blue setting to restore yourself to normal and all it takes is one quick sweep of the light to make your breasts shrink away to nothing and your muscular build to return, leaving you once again a perfectly normal guy.<br />
<br />
You think over what you've done with the light and consider how all the changes you've made so far have been partial. You haven't completely reversed anyone's gender yet and despite how drastic some of the changes have been, the victims have all continued to consider themselves their original gender. This makes you wonder if it takes a complete change to make them think of themselves as the opposite sex. Since you can't have fun with the girls you decide to have some fun with your family, more specifically your mom since you don't think you'll get the chance to use the light on your dad.<br />
<br />
Tiptoeing quietly into the hall you carefully loosen the bulb of the hall light just enough so that it won't turn on when your mom gets out of the bathroom, then you return to your room and wait. A few minutes later you hear your mom leave the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap,&quot; you hear her say when she finds that the light won't go on, &quot;This darned bulb's gone out again and I just replaced it last week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me check it,&quot; you say, coming out of your room and switching the magic flashlight onto its highest blue setting, making sure to sweep it over your mom a few times. In the darkened hall you don't get a good look at her changes, not that it bothers you. Soon enough you'll see your handy work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure it's switched off,&quot; you say to your mother, &quot;I'm going to see if the bulb is really burned out or if it's just not in straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nearly jump at the deep voice, then smile. Based on that alone it seems that the changes are quite drastic.<br />
<br />
Excited to see the body that goes with the voice, you give the light bulb a half twist and step back, turning off the magic flashlight just in case, &quot;Give it a try now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The light goes on and your eyes go wide when you get a look at the man who was, until moments ago, your mom. He has short brown hair, a goatee, and the angular sort of features that you would associate with a male model. The bath towel is wrapped loosely around his waist, giving you an excellent view of his muscular body. it's obvious that he spends a lot of time working out. He's not as hairy as the light ended up making Jenny, but there's a good amount of dark hair across his chest, stomach and arms. He smiles at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess I didn't get it in right, which normally isn't a problem for me,&quot; he laughs and goes to your parents' bedroom.<br />
<br />
So far there's no indication of what the changes to reality are in terms of your parent's relationship, but you figure that with them going out tonight you'll get a pretty good idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Katie,&quot; you hear your dad say form your little sister's room, &quot;That's the end of the story. Now I've got to finish getting ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch your dad walk by and think to yourself that next to what your mom has become he's a very ordinary looking guy, not at all the sort you'd suspect to be gay and in a relationship with someone who looks like a male model. <br />
<br />
You can hear soft conversation and masculine laughter from your parents' room once your dad goes in, but you can't make out words. Eventually they both come out. Both are wearing dress suits and the man that was formerly your mother looks to be resting his hand on your father's butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in front of the kids,&quot; your dad laughs, then allows your mother to pull him into a deep kiss.<br />
<br />
You realize that you'll need to figure out a new way to think of your mother, because there's nothing about the man that she has become to remind you of her. You also realize that the kiss is a lot longer and more passionate than anything you've previously seen from your parents.<br />
<br />
Your dad finally breaks the kiss, smiling as he does, &quot;Come on Tony, there'll be plenty of time for that later when we get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina used to be your mom's so you realize that now that she's a man it must be Tony.<br />
<br />
Tony smiles at your dad, &quot;Alright dear, let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch them leave, and by the time they're half way to the door Tony's hand is already back on your dad's butt.<br />
<br />
It's very weird and makes you more than a little uncomfortable, but at the same time it fascinates you.<br />
<br />
For the next few hours you let your little sister watch cartoons while you think of what else you might like to do with the light, coming up with a mental list of changes you'd like to see happen to different people you know.<br />
<br />
When it's time for your little sister to go to bed she does so without protest and then you go and find a few old family photo albums to look through. You take them to your room any lay them out on your bed, skimming until you find your parents' wedding photos. Both of them are men, of course, and both of them are dressed in suits. Everything else in the photos is the same as it would be for a normal wedding. There are two sets of best men and no bride's maids shown, but other than that nothing's exceptional. Both sides of the family are there and none of them seem at all upset at the idea of two men being wedded. If nothing else, you realize that the flashlight could mark remarkable steps forward for the acceptance of homosexuality if used properly, not that that's the sort of thing you worry too much about.<br />
<br />
Other than your mom having been replaced by Tony in the pictures everything else is boringly normal, which proves that the light is extremely powerful.<br />
<br />
You're still looking over the photos, examining baby pictures of yourself with your two male parents when they get home. You listen as they walk through the house and go to their bedroom, laughing and talking softly. Before long the laughter gives way to grunts and groans, deep breathing and hard panting as your parents have noisy, rough sex.<br />
<br />
Shuddering you turn off the lights and try to go to sleep.<br />
<br />
Never before can you recall hearing your parents having sex and it's shockingly loud, not to mention it goes on for much longer than you expected it to.<br />
<br />
Cramming your pillow over your head you try to ignore the sounds.</p>
