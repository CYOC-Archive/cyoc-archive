<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they entered, Kat explained her original spell, “When I turned you into my pussy, I set the spell up so that you would still have your senses.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, what’s your point?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
Kat continued. “We don’t really get along... I’m not sure we ever will, but I do want to change you back and put this behind us. I guess the reason I bought up the original spell is that...”<br />
<br />
“Um... I guess I’m just really sorry about what’s gonna happen next... It’s not something I had in mind when I started this.”<br />
<br />
“You mean shitting two inches away from the place that is currently acting as my nose and mouth?” Dan questioned.<br />
<br />
“Yea...” Kat sighed.<br />
<br />
“Just set me down by the bathtub. When you’re done on the toilet I’ll wipe you off, then we should take a quick shower. You’ll need to help me reach the knobs and the soap on the shelf.”<br />
<br />
“A shower?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, you’re a sticky mess and I’m all sweaty from earlier.” Kat answered.<br />
<br />
Dan didn’t argue. He knelt down and let her off. She waited by the bathtub while he slid onto the toilet seat. The pressure wasn’t anything to serious but his asshole released a medium sized log when he pushed. As suspected, the smell was just awful. It was so strong that he could almost taste it. To make matters worse, urine ejected from his pussy while the poo slid free.<br />
<br />
As he relieved their shared bodies of waste, Kat grabbed a small handful of toilet paper. Dan pushed out the last of it and stood up. He was glad to put distance between himself and the odor in the toilet bowl, but still felt gross with the remaining poo on his asshole. <br />
<br />
Kat instructed him to turn around in front of her. He leaned forward and she pulled his left butt cheek away for better access. She used a few folded squares of toilet paper to wipe away any excess shit and tossed them into the toilet. She also wiped some moisture from his pussy. He was glad to be rid of some of the urine taste right at his opening.<br />
<br />
Kat told him when she had finished and reached over to flush the toilet. “Can you lift me up so I can start the water?”<br />
<br />
Dan crouched down in front of her so she could grab on. She braced herself with one arm on his waist and reached in to turn on the water. She held the position with her hand under the spigot. When the water was warm, she pulled a tab to switch on the shower above.<br />
<br />
“Go ahead and step in. I’ll join in a second.” She said as Dan let her down by the tub.<br />
<br />
Dan stepped inside. The water was a little cooler than he preferred, but not uncomfortable. His sister pulled off her shirt and climbed over the edge to meet him. Without really thinking about her eight breasts, he turned around to face her. His vision rested on them, each wet orb shining in the dim bathroom light. He was horny again, and she knew it. He could see her face blushing red.<br />
<br />
“Dan, you really aught to stop with the dirty thoughts... I’m am your sister after all.”<br />
<br />
As she pulled the shower curtain closed he said, “Funny, you didn’t seem to have any problem sticking your tongue into me, even though I’m your brother.”<br />
<br />
“That’s my pussy, those are my legs and ass. Besides, you enjoyed it!” She argued.<br />
<br />
“I did, and I’m a boy who enjoys looking at tits. It doesn’t matter what I look like. Until this spell is undone, you need to remember who you’re talking to.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t expect me to shrug it off when you lick this pussy or flash me.”<br />
<br />
His comments must have hurt her feelings. She stayed quiet for the rest of the shower, only occasionally asking him to turn around or spread his legs as she scrubbed him off with soap and a rag.<br />
<br />
Dan didn’t care if she was mad. He felt like he made his point and was content to spent the rest of the time letting her scrub him down. He stopped caring so much about guilty thoughts and enjoyed looking at her breasts whenever he aimed his crotch at her. Weird as they were, they still turned him on. He could see her cheeks turning bright red when she lathered soap between each row. At one point she had to ask him to turn around so she could concentration. It felt so nice to be wiped down by his sister, to make her feel his arousal. There was almost a sense of revenge as she cared for him.<br />
<br />
When she was satisfied that they were both clean, she asked him to lift her up once more. This time Dan faced forward as he bent down. Kat noticed and rolled her eyes. Her expression made it clear that she thought he was a pervert, but she didn’t hesitate to grab hold. Dan had a close up view of her lower breasts as he stood up. He could feel their warmth against his legs and shivered. He nearly laughed out loud when he felt her shiver almost immediately after. Kat turned off the water and he set her back down.<br />
<br />
Her cheeks were red and she was smiling. “You’re such a dork...”</p>
