<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">
<P>Anthony sighed softly to himself, they were moving once again. He didn't care if outpost Bravo had gone missing or if they'd all killed themselves or if Sasquatch had had them for dinner. He had an appointment to keep and data to deliver.</P>
<P>The bus trundled along the road and Anthony glanced back in the darkness as the flashlights from outpost Alpha disappeared around a bend. Five to ten minutes later he heard gunfire from behind the bus in the distance and it set his nerves on edge. </P>
<P>Dr. Jones said, "That jumpy young lieutenant is probably shooting at shadows! Sheep; Take the ram away and they all get scared and disoriented!"</P>
<P>**************************</P>
<P>A few minutes after the bus had gone out of sight, the young commander of outpost Alpha heard a movement in the bushes.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Richard Hanson was young, only twenty-two and he was in charge of the other four men for one of only less than a handful of times in the last year. In the absence of his Captain Phillip 'The Tank' Harris, he felt incompetent. Hanson felt safer in the older man's presence. He was everything Hanson was not; confident, assured and took control of any situation. The tank had stepped into the forest to 'Take a huge crap' as he put it, but that had been almost thirty minutes ago. </P>
<P>"Geez! How long does it take the old fart to pinch off a loaf?" Hanson muttered to himself. Captain Raymond had called for Tank to take charge before he left to investigate the loss of contact with outpost Bravo.</P>
<P>"Tank! Is that you?" Hanson called. There wasn't an answer. </P>
<P>Hanson said to the four privates on guard. "I don't like this."</P>
<P>Private Mark Giles snickered to himself. He liked Hanson and Tank Harris too as did the other three men, but he was sure Tank was playing a joke on all of them or had to take a really long shit. Old guys get obsessive about their bowels, but he was probably messin’ with their heads. Tank was given to a certain prankish sense of humor and had often played fairly harmless jokes on them all to put his men at ease. Giles was sure Tank was having a bit of fun with the jumpy Lieutenant. After all, the company had said this was just routine and the dangers were quite minimal.</P>
<P>"Aw, Dick, it's just Tank messin' with you. He's probably hidin'..."</P>
<P>Just then they heard a snap like a thick twig and a grunt. A voice followed. It was Tank but he sounded different. Huskier, like he was hurt or something.</P>
<P>"Hanson I need a little help here!" Tank shouted and then grunted, "Aaaaagh! I’ve just stepped in a hole.... FUCK!"</P>
<P>Hanson called out, "Where are you?"</P>
<P>Hanson heard some grunting and some heavy panting like Tank was in a lot of pain. He then saw the red light from his signal flashlight. "Just follow the light," Tank gasped in pain, "Damn it! ... Bring Timms and leave the others. I think I might have broken something." There was a sharp cry of pain from Tank's direction. "Yeah, it's broken!"</P>
<P>Hanson motioned to Timms and said, "Giles, Bailey get the stretcher out. Joel, watch the road. We'll most likely have to evac Tank if that snap was his thighbone. This is a bit embarrassing for Tank, so don't call it in, I'll let him do that when we've got him stable." Hanson said.</P>
<P>With that Hanson and Timms headed off toward the source of the red light. Giles and Bailey saw some movement of to the side of the road in the opposite direction that Timms and Hanson had just went and Private Mike Joel was looking up the road. There was a roar and what sounded like a squeal from the direction Hanson Timms had gone. Joel, Bailey and Giles turned instinctively to look. Then turned just as suddenly to see with uncomprehending horror a huge draft horse animorph with wolf, stag and badger human hybrids step out onto the road right next to each of the privates. Bailey raised his automatic rifle and shot but it was too late, the horse had anticipated the move and pushed barrel of the gun out of way, directing it into the forest, then yanked it with a muscle tearing jerk out of Bailey's hands with a three fingered 'hoof-hand'. The horse moved with the control, grace, economy and skill of a Green Beret. The other animorphs struggled with Joel and Giles. </P>
<P>Just as swiftly a sweep of the animorph's horse like leg brought Bailey to the ground, flat on his back with the wind knocked out of him by the huge horseman’s blinding maneuver. The horse tossed the rifle under one of the Hummers and then moved and pinned Bailey on the gravelly dirt road. The Horse was on top of Bailey on his transformed hands and knees in seconds, his long muzzle was drooling spittle on Bailey's face and Bailey was struggling vainly to move his face out of the way of the drool. The Horseman grunted, then smiled showing his huge, squared flat front teeth. Then he spoke.</P>
<P>"Well, that was entertaining!" the horseman said. "How do you like the new look, Bailey? That's right, it's me, Major Conroy." Roger Conroy said and snorted through enlarged horse like nostrils. </P>
<P>Conroy was in charge of the four outpost security teams and had been down with outpost Bravo to check on things. </P>
<P>"I'm very pleased to offer you the opportunity to join a very elite group, now open your mouth and say 'Ah'." </P>
<P>Bailey clamped his mouth shut and Conroy whinnied out a laugh.</P>
<P>"Oh, won't eat your vegetables, eh?" said the horseman and then he bent toward the prone man and bit down on Bailey's shoulder. </P>
<P>Bailey cried out in pain and Conroy enveloped his opened mouth in his huge horse-lips, pushing his big tongue into Bailey's mouth. Bailey, forcibly French kissed by the ex-human/ex-Green Beret major found he couldn't keep the muscular tongue out as it probed and pushed it's way into his mouth and down his throat. Bailey gagged and struggled, but the horseman was far too strong. Conroy, even as a human, would have been too strong for Bailey to resist much, the man had been very large and very muscular and now he was enhanced beyond belief. Bailey breathed rapidly through his nose, taking in the strong scent of the horseman. His heart pounded with fear and he began to feel dizzy, as he was force fed the animorph horses' saliva. Minutes went by; slowly Bailey began to relax. He was falling under the influence of the pheromones and fluids being fed to him.</P>
<P>Conroy’s huge horse-cock was fully extended and was poking its slimy tip at Bailey's chin as he slowly humped Conroy's chest. The horseman's pre-come was wetting Bailey's chin and neck, oozing all over the chain that held Bailey's dog tags.</P>
<P>Conroy broke off his invasion of Bailey's mouth, sat back and looked down on the man he'd just mouth raped. The young man was ready, Conroy could tell. Bailey was moaning as he rubbed his own erection against the horseman's body. Conroy knew that this man was now his, he would join his herd eagerly now, just as the female horse animorph had become part of his herd after she had transformed him with her inviting sex. Conroy grasped the front neck of Bailey's uniform with his strong three digit hands, hooked a thick nailed finger over the edge of the black T-shirt and ripped off the soon to be useless black uniform. </P>
<P>Bailey moaned, "Oh, yes." and now that his hands were free he unbuckled his belt and wriggled out of his pants and shorts in expectation of the fucking he would receive from Conroy.</P>
<P>Conroy whinnied in triumph.</P>
<P>The horse cock rubbed wetly through the thickly haired chest of the young private and poked at his chin.</P>
<P>"Chow down, Son! Suck that head!" Conroy encouraged huskily.</P>
<P>Bailey, with warnings screaming in the back of his mind not to do it found he couldn't help himself. It was like he was on the outside looking at himself. He watched himself as if floating above his body, performing this vile act with the beast that used to be a man he respected greatly. He grabbed hold of the mottled dark and light colored horse cock and fit as much as he could into his mouth. He stroked on the slick shaft and began sucking the head furiously. Bailey's mouth was quickly filled with pre-come and he drank as much of the thick fluid as he could take, but still some still spilled from his mouth and down the side his cheeks, pooling in his ears. </P>
<P>Conroy grunted his pleasure. Looking up he saw Captain Raymond, now a majestic Stag-man, ass-fucking Giles from behind. Giles, completely inflamed in the passion of the mating was jerking his cock as Raymond was dominating him. Sergeant Miller, now a badger-man, humped a clawed and bleeding Joel in missionary position. Tenderly, the former hard-ass sergeant licked his mate's wounds and kissed Joel on the lips, slipping his tongue into the human's accepting mouth. The wolfman guarded the road with a rifle he'd taken from one of the privates.</P>
<P>Everything was going according to plan; and why not? Conroy was a brilliant tactician after all! He and a few of the transformed men and Captain Raymond had found Conroy's ol’ buddy 'Tank' taking a shit in the woods. It was a stroke of luck and Conroy took advantage of it immediately. The bus stopping by had been icing on the cake because it had distracted the men further and they hadn't heard Tank's muffled cries as he had started changing into his new muscular hulking form, pinned beneath his new furry lover. It also allowed Conroy, Raymond and Sergeant Miller and one of Raymond's privates to cross the road and get into position for the surprise attack.</P>
<P>"Now time for some serious pleasure!" He almost growled as he looked at the enthralled Bailey. </P>
<P>"Open your legs and your body to me Bailey, you belong to me now!" He barked the order because he knew the military conditioning would cause Bailey to respond even if there was any resistance left in the young man. Conroy had himself experienced this internal resistance while trying uselessly to fight off the effects of the sweet scent of his draft horse mate. In the end, he had buried his face in the mare's dripping wet sex and drank it in. Bailey opened his legs and spread his cheeks to offer His Horselord full access to his hole. Conroy took Bailey's legs and placed one on each side of his thick equine neck.</P>
<P>"Grab those cheeks and spread 'em, soldier!" Conroy barked again and immediately Bailey pulled his cheeks apart, opening himself fully to the invasion to come. Conroy positioned his drooling head at the tight hole that would soon stretch and then grow to fit his enormous cock. Conroy milked the pre-come from his long equine cock, pumping the long shaft with his powerful hoof-hands and smeared the clear horse lubricant all over the moaning private's asshole and his long shaft. Conroy marveled at the beautiful mottled cock he had grown just an hour and a half ago and he knew that Bailey would be eternally thankful to him for this gift when he himself looked down at his own huge cock and balls, the fulfillment of almost every man's dream.</P>
<P>Without any preparation other than the slick clear horse fluid, Conroy forcefully pushed his ridged steel pole deep into the horny moaning private. There were shrieks of pain from Bailey that were quickly muffled by the horseman's thick hairy lips and invading tongue. Bailey struggled again for freedom from the pain and from his new existence. Shock had temporarily broken the spell, but it was utterly futile. Conroy had him now, it was only a matter of time before the young man's body would shiver and spasm and he would become a strong virile stallion in The Hoselord's herd. The mating ritual of The Horselord and his new lover had begun in earnest.</P>
<P>**************************</P>
<P>Before Bailey had managed to get his warning shot off, a warning shot that would mean nothing anyway, Hanson had come to within a few yards of Tank's light, which he'd followed easily. He couldn't hear Tank anymore, grunting or moaning or anything. Tank must have passed out or something. He got to within a few feet of the light and saw it was strapped to a sapling with shoelaces. A roar next to his ear scared the Hell out of Hanson and he fumbled and dropped his rifle, which he'd been carrying far to loosely. At the same moment a squeal to his left and a quick glance saw a large Boar-man had just pounced on Timms, knocking his rifle away into the underbrush. Suddenly Hanson's attention was brought back to the creature that had roared. It was undeniably Tank, but he had a thick grey beard and his naked body was partially covered in thickening brown fur. He was shockingly bigger than he'd been before he'd gone into the woods.</P>
<P>"Hello Dick!" Was all Tank said as he knocked Hanson to the ground and began to shred his uniform. Hanson tried to get away, crawling on his hands and knees, but Tank was as big before this change as Conroy had been before his transformation and now Tank’s lager enhanced body was far stronger and faster than the Hanson’s. Soon, Tank had Dick Hanson on his belly and was spreading his cheeks, preparing him for forced mating.</P>
<P>"It'll all be over in an hour, Dick." Tank said and spit out a few more of his human teeth, "You, me and Smokey back in the bushes will be part of a little Bear Clan!" Tank said as he forced his changing cock into Dick's ass. As Tank force-fucked the young man the changes in his massive human body sped up. His voice deepened further with each grunt and his entire body became covered in the grizzly pelt he had begun sprouting after he had succumb to the passions of his new lover. His balls swelled for new action and he began pumping the last of his human sperm into Dick's ass. Tank moaned in pleasure as he released his seed and felt the tingling throughout his body of the building of his first orgasm as a Bear-man. He felt his balls tingle as they changed and filled with Animorph Bear sperm. His claws were pushing out his weak human fingernails and his muscles rippled beneath his growing fur. His chest was barreling out and his muzzle was making its final adjustments into its final form. </P>
<P>Tank felt like a God! Filled with incredible power and lust and his puny young friend beneath him would share this power. It's why he had lured him off, he knew the young man had a soft spot for him and had played on it for Dick's own benefit.</P>
<P>Dick cursed and struggled, then screamed into the loamy soil as the huge bear’s cock invaded his ass. Dick heard Timms being violated in a similar manner by the boar-man and down near the road he heard other bestial activity. A horse whinny and what he learned later was the cry of a Stag.</P>
<P>Outpost Alpha had been neutralized... and converted.</P>
<P>**************************</P>
<P>The bus rolled up to the makeshift blockade at outpost Bravo and stopped... no one seemed to be around and Dr. Jones was becoming just a bit spooked. </P>
<P>This was enough for Anthony; he had to get out. That emergency exit would get some use as soon as it was safe to make a break for it.</P></p>
