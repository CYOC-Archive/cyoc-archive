<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The detonation of the vaccine bomb would effectively put an end to the outbreaks in the long term. Li Sang might figure out some way to alter the virus, but given that he personally knew little of genetics, it was figured it would take for whatever scientists he had either bribed or had bullied into serving him to figure it out.  That would give them the time to mount an honest attempt to catch Li Sang and whoever worked with him. No one one man could hide forever and with the UN sponsoring an international manhunt, that would ultimately find itself working heavily with Interpol and various law enforcement agencies within various countries and a rapidly growing number of Kats joining the manhunt, it was expected that the man and his supporters could not stay hidden for long. It would of course mean major changes for all of the Kats.<br />
<br />
The biggest would be Janace. When Jess, Nikole, Charlie, Sally, Maurice, and Snowy first moved there, it had been with the intention of getting away from the potential tensions of city life and to stay out of people&#39;s way. Now, after being called in to combat various outbreaks, beginning with Paris over six years ago, they were finding themselves taking on a ton of new responsibilities and new lives. They had been joined by Alexis, Flake, Danna, and Mikkie after Paris, and Charlie and Sally adopted Luna and Midnight. Talia had agreed to join them after Egypt, at least until Midnight grew up. Lia and hir family joined them after Egypt as well, and hir family were Janace&#39;s first human residents. Joining them from Sydney came Mikkie&#39;s sister and from Hong Kong, Gloria Nu, and that didn&#39;t include the babies born in Janace or the other Kats that had moved there to live their own lives. As such with all these changes, a decent sized airstrip had been constructed and the Kats all watched the UN and the US government begin building some rather official looking buildings to suit the headquarters that would be required for the manhunt for Li Sang.<br />
<br />
And it was to the sound of the construction crews that Mikkie and Danna made their way into the room in their home that Sammy and Gloria were given. They found the two Dracokats laying comfortably in their nest, made from various pillows, and their bodies wrapped around their eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you two, you okay?&quot; Danna asked as shi lead Mikkie in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Gloria answered, &quot;Just incubating...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you both pregnant yet?&quot; Sammy asked inquisitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Danna gave a smile, &quot;Both Mikkie and I are now pregnant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange we weren&#39;t in heat at the same time,&quot; Mikkie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It happens,&quot; Danna shrugged as shi hopped up onto Gloria and Sammy&#39;s bed, &quot;Snowy said some of that stuff depends how well we eat and what we eat and that an individual Kat will respond differently to different things. You probably ate well and ate something that made your body feel strong enough to go into heat whereas I... I didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that that matters now,&quot; Mikkie answered and hopped up beside Danna and purred.<br />
<br />
And that was true. Regardless of whether they were lust filled or had their minds back, Kats lived to love and seemed to also live to raise families. Charlie and Sally and the infants Fluffy and Mary, their six year olds Janice and Pinkie, their adopted soughters Luna and Midnight. Jess and Nikole had Silky and Foxy and both were pregnant with their second set of kittens. Maurice was pregnant with hir first kitten, and shi and Snowy had Snowflake. Sammy and Gloria&#39;s rapid pregnancy had come as a surprise, but it was soon figured that since they laid eggs, the overall gestation period would be about the same as most of the development of life inside an egg usually occurred after the egg was laid. And now, Alexis, Flake, Danna, and Mikkie were all pregnant with their first kittens. That sort of family life made all of them happy, and even Sammy, who had once felt being a hermaphrodite, a Kat would be too weird for hir, wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. Kats seemed to adapt to being Kats rather easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sammy smiled, &quot;and when our eggs hatch, you&#39;ll hopefully be ready to give birth and our soughters will all grow up together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is if we&#39;re still hunting Li Sang,&quot; Gloria commented, &quot;Once he&#39;s caught, I will have to return to China...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy, Mikkie, and Danna traded nervous glances.<br />
<br />
&quot;But China won&#39;t let us keep all our eggs!&quot; Sammy gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can always work something out,&quot; Gloria answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you could &quot;retire&quot; like General Heroud did,&quot; Danna commented, &quot;Retire and ask for a visa to live here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe go back to Sydney,&quot; Sammy quipped, &quot;we&#39;d fit in with all the other Kats there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or anywhere else where there&#39;s been an outbreak, love,&quot; Gloria sighed, &quot;but for the moment... all of that is a future decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you think that?&quot; Charlie asked back to Sally.<br />
<br />
Sally sighed and looked down, &quot;Because it was disloyal of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was forced on you!&quot; Charlie said and pulled Sally into a firm hug, &quot;I only wish I could have been there to protect you... but I was ungodly fat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were pregnant and gave birth before I could get home,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;There&#39;s nothing you could have done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie only hugged Sally and purred against hir. Eventually Sally worked up the courage to ask the question on hir mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re okay with me being pregnant... even if you aren&#39;t the father?&quot; Sally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit that I wish I could be your new soughter&#39;s biological father,&quot; Charlie purred, &quot;but I love you and we&#39;ll raise your new soughter together. Home and family is where your heart is. Your heart and family is with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sally said sounding relieved, &quot;Hopefully shi gets along well with your little darlings.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then turned to a special crib where Fluffy and Mary were sleeping peacefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re our little darlings,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;You&#39;re their father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally reached down and rubbed the back of Fluffy&#39;s taur half, &quot;Yes... yes I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then turned to the sounds of the construction outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what will we do now,&quot; Sally commented, &quot;Janace was so quiet... we agreed to come here to get away from all the noise...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now its followed us,&quot; Charlie nodded, &quot;but we can&#39;t leave mom and Jess... and Janice, Pinkie, and Midnight still have school and lessons with Talia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally nodded. Talia had been teaching the kids in Janace both Ancient Egyptian and Arabic. Midnight got the bulk of these lessons, but the ancient Sphinx seemed quite intent on teaching all the little Kats their original heritage. However, that wasn&#39;t the concern. The rest related to hunting Li Sang, and at the moment that required a lot of preparatory work. Charlie moved one of the shades in their bedroom window and looked out. They could see what would be a large square building rising up near where the main headquarters was intended to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose we&#39;ll end up becoming official &quot;Kat Kops&quot; to hunt Li Sang and make sure that no one figures out a new way to run the virus,&quot; Charlie then shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Essentially holding a full time job cleaning up after Snowy and Maurice&#39;s mistakes,&quot; Sally sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have admitted that they went about it wrong,&quot; Charlie reminded hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;I know... and at heart they are family.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jess and Raul Heroud were looking more closely at the new buildings being built. For the most part the exterior of the building of the building was completed, but there were a lot of workers going in and out with things to put things together for the inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;The headquarters building will have everything we need,&quot; Raul said slowly, &quot;it&#39;ll have satellite up-links with Interpol, the UN, and will allow us to even get in contact with any individual government. It&#39;d be complete with a video screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Nikole, Sally, Charlie, and I can talk with my dad?&quot; Jess wondered, &quot;I&#39;m sure shi&#39;d like to see hir newest grand-kittens that Charlie gave birth to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And see how big you and Nikole are getting?&quot; Raul cut hir off.<br />
<br />
Unlike Jess, and most Foxkats that had been based off of the Fennec Fox, Raul was actually based off of the Red Fox, as a simple Foxtaur, he was 100% male. He did look a bit younger, thanks to the transformation, but that had seemed to be the case with all the people touched by the Chakat Virus or serum. While it didn&#39;t accelerate aging, meaning Luna and Midnight didn&#39;t suddenly become adults when they transformed, those that were older did seem to get younger post transformation.<br />
<br />
Jess only shook hir head and looked back at the bulge in the sides of hir taur half. In the weeks since Charlie gave birth, shi, Nikole, and Maurice had gotten a bit bigger as their kittens grew bigger inside them, and within hir heart, Jess felt overjoyed at that. It would give Silky and Foxy younger siblings to play with and love and be loved by. And along with all the other Kat babies and children, they&#39;d be part of a great happy family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes...,&quot; Jess admitted, &quot;and I would like to see my sithers there in Paris as well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t think Alexis and Flake have told hir mother of HIR pregnancy yet,&quot; Raul commented, &quot;Though I could be wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief silence for a moment before Raul got to answering the original question.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the UN and the other agencies that are going to be part of the hunt for Li Sang, and whoever is working with or for him... I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get too much opposition,&quot; Raul commented, &quot;Your American President was supposedly in Fee City as part of a publicity tour to back some domestic policy issue and ended up a Kat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the reason the FBI and the National Guard were so quick to surround and quarantine the city,&quot; Jess commented, &quot;they intended to rescue the commander in chief.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, between the American President being a Kat and France&#39;s &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Queen&quot; being Kats, you&#39;ll get more than enough funding to get things going,&quot; Raul commented.<br />
<br />
Jess nodded. Shi had never imagined the idea that shi or Sally would be in a place where they would be considered princesses, but they were... though the situation was not quite the Disney or My Little Pony type of situation. Hir father and Francine were France&#39;s King and Queen, but it had later turned out that the French President HADN&#39;T resigned his office, he was simply fearful of ending up a Kat himself. The whole situation nearly exploded into a civil war and only calmed down with a compromise, which allowed France&#39;s Republican government to stand and that the French President still served as its leader, but Justin and Francine would hold the ceremonial role as head of state, and would agree not to openly brand the President as a coward for not immediately returning to his capital to soothe the people after a time of crisis. In that sense, France&#39;s government came to mirror Britain&#39;s, but to Jess that didn&#39;t really matter, and shi figured it gave hir father and Francine the time to do what Kats loved most, love each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funding doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;d be available for private conversations,&quot; Jess told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Raul sighed, &quot;but until some new outbreak occurs in an area where the Vaccine Bomb hasn&#39;t reached yet... or until we get some notification where Li Sang is, you should have the time... and there will be MULTIPLE lines, so even if something important does come in, it won&#39;t be as if they&#39;ll hit a busy signal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be a relief,&quot; Jess said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition... since your father and hir mate and the President won&#39;t accept my resignation until after Li Sang has been captured and we&#39;re completely sure there are no more outbreaks to come,&quot; Raul said with a short sigh, &quot;you&#39;ll still have me around your chief officer with regards to operations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had heard that they did accept your resignation?&quot; Jess said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;From the army, yes, from service, no,&quot; Raul answered, &quot;My service is now in a more &quot;civilian&quot; capacity. I won&#39;t be able to throw my weight around as much... but I suppose it will keep me busy... and to be honest... since my transformation... I&#39;ve felt a lot more energized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... good for you,&quot; Jess spoke, &quot;because with Charlie nursing newborns, and Maurice, Nikole, and I getting closer to our due dates...we won&#39;t be able to go anywhere if something big comes along.&quot;</p>
