<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The war in Ukraine has been met with disapproval everywhere, particularly in Russia itself. The Russian people were becoming increasingly fed up with Putin&#39;s autocracy and his unilateral declaration of invasion didn&#39;t do any efforts to win them over. But when the Russian army started drafting civilians, practically snatching up people in the streets to press-gang them into military service and throw them at the faltering invasion, that was the last straw for many people. Now it wasn&#39;t just Ukrainians who are flee their war-torn homeland, but Russians who were leaving their country to get out from under the heel of their increasingly-tyrannical leader.<br />
<br />
This had a few effects on Animalia as well. For starters, the plans for an Animalian colony in Russia were effectively scuppered until there&#39;s a massive improvement in political relationships. And that seemed unlikely while Putin is still in power. It also meant that Animalia and its various colonies were receiving an influx of Russian immigrants. Yashka and Bystrouska were simply among the first to join Animalia.<br />
<br />
There were others who preceded the foxes, namely Mr. and Mrs. Nozdrin. Elly was quite relieved that her parents were able to immigrate to the United States successfully. She had worried a bit that the Russian government make that special exception to their leaving the country, as they were their only link to an Animalian student who could provide them with their own supply of the virus. But fortunately the war and the large amount of other emigrating citizens made it easy for them to overlook the Nozdrins.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Elly had seen her parents after her conversion, most often through webcam. When the relations Russia had with the rest of the world started souring, it became increasingly harder to get in contact with them. Over time, it became even riskier for Ellie to return to Russia. Though honestly, she was less willing to return to Russia. She had some bad memories of Russia, namely of how she was bullied for being so large for her age. And while there were flaws with capitalism and democracy that she could see, she can look at her old country&#39;s politics from the outside and see the glaring problems. Elly was quite relieved that her parents were able to come to America to stay.<br />
<br />
The most awkward part of meeting her parents wasn&#39;t that she still wasn&#39;t accustomed to towering over them as a rhino Animalian, it&#39;s introducing Rod to them. Since Ellie helped Rod get a better control over his animal aggression, they had become quite close. How close was a matter of debate, but definitely close enough that her parents would notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Nozdrin,&quot; said Rod to her parents. He seemed a little sheepish compared to the much smaller Russians. Ellie apparently got her Nordic features from her father, Aleksi. Her mother, Ivana, had darker hair and eyes and was smaller than her daughter was before she converted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizavita, is this your...boyfriend?&quot; asked Ivana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Elly at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;No?&quot; asked Rod, a little dismayed. The two rhinos gave each other confused looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vould you care to explain?&quot; asked Ivana, a little crisply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ve are vhat Americans call, uh... benefit friends?&quot; said Ellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s &#39;friends with benefits&#39;,&quot; said Rod. He backed up a bit at Ivana&#39;s withering glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ivana, Elizavita is grown voman now,&quot; said Aleksi, &quot;She can be vith who she likes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zat is not problem,&quot; said Ivana, &quot;I vant to know vhy he is not boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Rod used to have no... <i>interes k zhenshchin</i>,&quot; said Ellie, putting it at delicately as she could, &quot;He vas hostile vith me at first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are voman?&quot; asked Aleksi, sounding angered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I am Russian,&quot; said Ellie, &quot;But ve have overcome zat problem. But since no other <i>gey</i> men became rhino, ve, uh, relieve each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear I have never taken advantage of her,&quot; said Rod, &quot;If nothing else, we are at least very close friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I expect you to treat her vell until you are ready vith &#39;boyfriend&#39;,&quot; said Ivana.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Not long after Ellie&#39;s parents had settled into Lyre, they wanted to take it a step further. They were both wanting to convert, naturally with Ellie as their donor. At least Ellie was not required to give them her milk in person. Even so, the thought of her parents drinking her milk and becoming rhinos not much physically older than her was rather awkward. Especially when she knew there was bound to be mating afterwards. Still, at least her parents were going to be starting new lives.<br />
<br />
Aleksi and Ivana had secured themselves a cabin at Lover&#39;s Wood. Along with the thermos containing Ellie&#39;s milk, they also had spare clothes from her and Rod for them to wear afterwards. &quot;It feels like we&#39;re on our second honeymoon,&quot; said Aleksi. Since they didn&#39;t have to talk with any Americans, they could relax with their native Russian language.<br />
<br />
&quot;It still feels strange relying on our daughter for our change,&quot; said Ivana. She could remember feeding Elly with her own breasts. At least she wouldn&#39;t be feeding directly from Elly&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could have asked any other rhino to be our donor. There are plenty here,&quot; said Aleksi. The Rhino Guard had originally started with the world&#39;s last Northern White Rhinoceroses being uplifted and their honor guards joining them. Since then, the Rhino Guard has been Animalia&#39;s SWAT team, though there were very few occasions where their strength was needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be honest, I&#39;m a little...jealous of Elizavita,&quot; said Ivana, &quot;She became particularly beautiful for a rhino.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; said Aleksi a bit awkwardly. Ellie&#39;s enhanced curves weren&#39;t lost on him, but she was still his daughter. &quot;So why wait any longer? The milk is still fresh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to strip?&quot; asked Ivana.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see what it&#39;s like to grow out of clothes like superhero,&quot; admitted Aleksi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; said Ivana. With that, the two Russians took long drinks from the thermos, enough to constitute a double-dose and restore their youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...creamier than I expected,&quot; said Aleksi.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that means she isn&#39;t pregnant,&quot; said Ivana, &quot;I should have a talk with her about safe-&quot; She was cut off when she felt an intense warmth in her stomach. That warmth was was quickly spreading through her body. Aleksi was soon feeling that warmth coiling through his veins as well.<br />
<br />
The first sign of their change was their increase in height. They weren&#39;t particularly short people, but Elly had been quite a bit larger before she converted. Aleksi and Ivana soon caught up with that height and then surpassed it. Their clothes became increasingly tighter as they surged in height. Their shirts pulled to reveal tightening abs while their shirt and pants sleeves began splitting at the seams. As more skin was exposed, it could be seen growing grey and rougher.<br />
<br />
Their socks and shoes split open, revealing their toes were growing far larger. Two pairs of toes on each foot fused together and grew to match the size and shape of the altered big toe. As the backs of their clothes split, a ropy tail started growing from the base of their spines. But the real change went on with their heads as they remold into new shapes. Their ears grew bigger as they moved towards the back of their heads. Their faces distorted quite heavily as her mouths pushed out into muzzles. Their nostrils moved further down while the cartilage in their noses started swelling into a distinct point.<br />
<br />
Their clothes didn&#39;t have a chance of surviving the rest of their transformation. Aleksi&#39;s swelling muscles shredded apart what remained of this clothes. If Ivana&#39;s muscles didn&#39;t destroy her clothes all the way, her growing curves finished them. Her widening hips and ass overpowered what was left of her lower garments. Her breasts had already broken through her bra straps. By the time they grew to the breaking point, her shirt wasn&#39;t so much as burst open as it was catapulted off.<br />
<br />
When the transformation finally settled, Aleksi and Ivana took in their new forms. Aleksi was quite a buff specimen, though it was hard to say if he was any larger than any of the other male rhinos. Ivana, on the other hand, definitely benefited from drinking Ellie&#39;s milk. Like her, Ivana now had larger breasts than the average female rhino, along with a boosted height and large muscles. In many ways, she was the spitting image of her daughter. The main differences between them was that Ivana had darker hair and eyes than Ellie&#39;s blue-eyed blondeness.<br />
<br />
While their sense of smell was not as enhanced as a dog or pig&#39;s, the two new rhinos could smell each other&#39;s arousal. It had been rather awkward for Aleksi to look at Ellie&#39;s busty, curvaceous figure as she was his own daughter. But he had no problem at all seeing that figure on his wife. Ivana found Aleksi&#39;s new form to very desirable as well, especially when his penis swelled up to a very formidable size. &quot;I had no idea that rhinos were so...big...&quot; said Ivana in a breathy voice that surprisingly didn&#39;t sound deeper, though it did sound younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that surprising, really,&quot; said Aleksi, also sounding younger. He gripped his engorged cock and moaned, &quot;But it&#39;s still quite sensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I should help you out with it,&quot; said Ivana, walking over to her husband. It was a bit awkward to be kissing, mostly because of how their horns rubbed together. At least they had the square upper lip of the white rhino instead of the hooked lip of the black rhino. Ivana&#39;s huge breasts bumped against Aleksi&#39;s enhanced chest muscles while his cock poked her firmer stomach.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Aleksi couldn&#39;t take it any longer. He picked up Ivana (which was far less of a challenge than he expected) and carried her over to the bed. The bed was designed for larger Animalians, so it had no problem with the two rhinos that were now on it. Ivana moaned loudly as Aleksi impaled her with his cock. The two of them soon got into a rhythm, showing more spirit and energy than their first honeymoon. Of course, their Animalian bodies had so much more stamina now. Aleksi ended up exploding inside of Ivana several times before they stopped to rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see why Elizavita and Rod have been doing this,&quot; said Aleksi, &quot;Rhinos are hornier than I would have thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he better have not gotten her pregnant,&quot; said Ivana, &quot;Especially if he&#39;s not her official boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aleksi put his mouth on one of her nipples and sucked. Ivana moaned as she felt her husband drawing her fresh milk out. Eventually, Aleksi  removed his lips and licked. &quot;Just as creamy as hers,&quot; he said, &quot;I think this is natural for rhinos, unless I just put another child in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ivana rubbed her stomach. Another child did appealed to her, now that they lived in a safer country with a more benevolent government. &quot;I doubt I&#39;m a mother again just yet,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust our daughter is smart enough to practice safe sex,&quot; said Aleksi.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but I&#39;m still going to find out just how they ended up being &#39;friends-with-benefits&#39;,&quot; said Ivana with a snort.</p>
