<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark jogged back to the Tollivers' house where the music was still blaring and the party rolling along as strong as ever.  He decided to run around back to the pool and see what was going on there.  <br />
<br />
The lights were only half on as he turned the corner to the sound of happy laughter and shouts.  When he got close, he saw that a dozen boys and girls had shed their costumes and were skinny dipping.  A couple kids who knew Mark shouted for him to join them.  Mark laughed and nodded that he would. He maneuvered around the other side of a bush where he figured he could stash his clothes and was bent over pulling off his shorts when he heard a sound.  He glanced and saw Zoe.  She laughed.<br />
&quot;I usually have to work hard than this to get a boy out of his clothes.  I didn't think you'd be the easiest one ever&quot;<br />
Somewhere under his coating of carmel brown fur, Mark was blushing.<br />
&quot;I-I was just going to jump in the pool&quot; he said, covering over his pink, pointy little penis with both hands.<br />
&quot;Relax&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;So was I . . until now&quot;<br />
She looked Mark right in his unchanged eyes and though Mark felt a bit insecure, being naked while she was still in her costume, he matched the force of her stare.  She moved forward and Mark was somewhat taken aback, again, by her aggressiveness.  He was still covering his penis as she reached around behind him and grabbed his fantastically round and now fur covered buns.<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm.  I've wanted to do this since the first time I saw you in tights&quot; she said and then laughed &quot;Every single woman who ever saw you at the ballet school wanted to do this&quot; she added and vigorously massaged Mark's glutes.  Mark nearly tore her costume off her despite trying to be as careful as possible, buttons flying and making little 'tink' sounds off the concrete of the pool apron.  With another chuckle, she accomodated him by pulling off all her clothes.  They were out of sight of anyone at the pool or in the house where they were entwined around the corner.  <br />
<br />
To Mark, it was almost a cruel tease, here was a girl who was going to be as aggressive as he was, maybe more, and with his claws and fangs, he had to be extremely careful.  Mark showered her with delicate kisses, just touching his fang fronted mouth to her neck and breasts.  She just kept fixated on his buns, mesmerized by the furry arcs of Mark's behind.  Mark tried to look in her eyes.  He expected to exchange at least a few meaningful words, but she had no interest and wouldn't respond to anything Mark side.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Mark leaned back.  &quot;Hey, can't you spare at least a few words&quot; he chuckled.<br />
Zoe smirked and squeezed Mark's buns.  &quot;Don't try and make it more than what it is, Mark.  This is what you are to me&quot; she said giving him another squeeze.  &quot;You're an interesting body, just the greatest little ass out there.  But that's all you are&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh&quot;<br />
She chuckled.  &quot;You're hurt, aren't you?&quot;<br />
Mark took a deep breath.  &quot;No.  I'm fine&quot;<br />
&quot;Good&quot; she smiled.  &quot;Now what are you, green or a red?  You looked like a red soft&quot;<br />
Mark was completely lost.  She leaned back and pointed to his crotch.<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; she let out a high pitched chuckle of surprise.  Mark glanced down and saw that his pink, pointy little wolf's penis, now erect, had become his great big human phallus.  He chuckled.  Another compromise.  Wolf flaccid and human erect.  Zoe jumped over to the pile of her clothes and produced a green trojan condom, the large size.  <br />
&quot;Here&quot; she said handing it to Mark, but Mark just held up his claws and chuckled.<br />
&quot;Oh . . yeah.  Alright.  I'll do it&quot;<br />
While Mark looked on with a mischievous smile, Zoe giggled and rolled the rubber onto Mark's giant penis, chuckling all the while.  Okay, thought Mark.  I'm just an ass, just a body to you.  Here comes reciprocity, honey.<br />
<br />
As soon as she was done, Mark spun her around and bent her over the cold hood of the riding mower parked there.  He rammed his organ into her from behind and started.  He didn't ease up at all, thrusting into her with all the might of the buns she so fancied.  At first, the rhythm was fairly slow, but after just a few seconds, Mark was fucking her at a rate he could never have managed as a human.  The combination of his human and lupine natures had left his human sexual endurance but given him a wolf's energy.  After five minutes, Zoe was panting and moaning uncontrollably.  Mark started licking her with his 10 inch long tongue and giving her hickies with his sharp teeth.  As he thrust away, he left a trail of marks all over her neck and rubbed his paw pads all over her breasts.  Then, as he was starting to lose his own control, he noticed a particularly frantic response from her as he thrust very deep.  He slammed away at it over and over again.  <br />
&quot;Oh!  Oh!!  Oh!!!&quot; Zoe started letting out high pitched chirps in troikas and slamming her hands down on the riding mower's metal hood.  Mark gave a firm slap to her round little ass and laughed but continued.  Finally, he could endure no more and shot his seed.  He pulled out of her and very carefully pulled the condom off with one claw delicately placed just under the edge of the roll.  In true dog fashion, he kicked a spot into the dirt, tossed it there and then covered it over.  Zoe leaned back against the mower looking at him in surprise as Mark gathered his clothes and then got dressed.  As he walked past her heading back to the chronivac, she put one hand on his furry shoulder.<br />
&quot;Mark.  I . . &quot;<br />
&quot;Stick to what you know&quot; said Mark and he moved her hand from his shoulder to the side of his ass partly covered by shredded pants.  Then he walked on, leaving her there.  <br />
<br />
In the distance, from the street in front of the Tollivers, he could see through a gap in the woods, Jeff turning back from a bear into a human, his pudgy body slimming and losing fur, his muzzle diminishing into human facial shape.  He was going to give Jeff hell for not being more careful when he heard a step from his right and suddenly found himself grabbed and then held upside down by one ankle.<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;</p>
