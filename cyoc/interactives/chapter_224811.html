<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus pulled Jake to the side. &quot;You&#39;ve got some weird shit on your shirt, bro. Hold still.&quot; He wiped his hand along Jake&#39;s chest. &quot;Eugh, it&#39;s sticky. What the fuck is this?&quot; He stared at his hand and sniffed it. His eyes went wide. To Jake&#39;s surprise, it wasn&#39;t with alarm. &quot;I think it&#39;s cum.&quot; Marcus&#39;s voice was barely a whisper. Before Jake could even begin to process how cum got on his shirt, Marcus began to lick his hand. He groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcus?!&quot; Jake asked, bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the good stuff,&quot; Marcus said. A strange aroma wafted in the air between the two of them. Jake felt his cock starting to stir more insistently. &quot;Damn, bro, my pussy is on fire today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pussy?&quot; Jake asked, feeling his dick respond against his jeans. &quot;Y-you have...?&quot; But wait, if Marcus has a pussy, too, then why haven&#39;t they fucked around with each other? What had been stopping them?<br />
<br />
&quot;This cum, is it yours?&quot; Marcus asked, still licking his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Jake lied. He honestly didn&#39;t know where the cum came from. He couldn&#39;t remember. He thought he had thoroughly cleaned up after himself when he had to jack off his rocket earlier today. But if he hadn&#39;t, why was Marcus waiting until now to say something? Was that the reason why he had been giving Jake all those strange looks?<br />
<br />
&quot;Think I could get some more?&quot; Marcus asked, looking pointedly at Jake&#39;s crotch. His cock swelled in response and started to emerge from its sheath. It began to make a profound bulge in his pants and even poked out above the waistline. Marcus looked around excitedly and then pulled Jake into a janitor&#39;s closet. He locked the door behind him and leaned in close to Jake. The strange smell from before seemed to intensify. Jake felt himself heating up. Marcus lifted Jake&#39;s shirt up and saw his pulsing, writhing, red hot, doggy cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Marcus gasped. &quot;Why have I never noticed how hot you are, bro?&quot; He looked into Jake&#39;s eyes with mad lust in his own. &quot;Fuck sucking you off. I need you inside of me, <i>now</i>!&quot; Their lips crashed into one another, and Jake let his questions fall to the wayside. He and Marcus kissed each other and wrapped their arms around their backs. Each of their hands moved lower and lower until they had firm grips on the muscular asses of their partner. Jake groaned into Marcus and stuck his thickening tongue deep into Marcus&#39;s mouth. Marcus whimpered and instantly began fumbling with the button of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your tongue is huge!&quot; Marcus gasped. Jake panted with his tongue hanging past his chin. Marcus started to smile. &quot;That goes in first. Get me ready, bro.&quot; Marcus thrust his pants around his ankles and turned around. He stuck his ass up and presented a moist and inviting pussy back at Jake. The smell was intoxicating, and it was coming from that spot. Jake wasted no time. He grabbed Marcus&#39;s ass and dove his tongue inside. Marcus whimpered and whined. He leaned back against Jake as his tongue lapped against the edges of Marcus&#39;s pussy. He could go deeper, but that was reserved for the throbbing cock that was ready to break through his jeans.<br />
<br />
Jake leaned back, undid his jeans, aimed his cock, and pushed inside. Marcus braced himself on his hands and knees, throwing his head back. Once in, Jake climbed on top of Marcus. He began to thrust. He felt a sense of urgency to fill Marcus up with his seed. His tongue licked the back of Marcus&#39;s neck. Marcus rocked against him. Suddenly, Marcus started to whine a little too loudly. His pussy squeezed Jake&#39;s cock tightly. Pleasure surged over his body, but Jake had enough sense to cover Marcus&#39;s mouth with his hand. They couldn&#39;t get caught in here like this. This was just for them and nobody else.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s cock knotted inside Marcus and burst like a water hose. He filled up Marcus&#39;s pussy almost to the brink. Marcus whined again through Jake&#39;s hand as his cock started to erupt onto his shirt and onto the floor. Jake felt a fog roll through his head. He shook it and tried to reorient himself against his mate. His... mate? That seemed... wrong somehow. They were friends, certainly. But boyfriends? Mates? This was the first time they fucked, right?<br />
<br />
Jake leaned back with his knot still firmly inside Marcus. He pulled Marcus into a sitting pseudo-sitting position. He lowered his head and looked at Marcus&#39;s dick. He smiled and felt his pussy twitch. Marcus&#39;s own cock had just finished releasing its load. Normally, Jake would be all over that cock. But he felt somehow satisfied from their adventure in the bathroom this morning, which still felt like a year ago. But that didn&#39;t really make sense. Marcus&#39;s cock turned him on, certainly. It was bigger than most but somehow didn&#39;t quite hit all of Jake&#39;s buttons. Still, as mates, they agreed to take turns being the fucker and the fuckee. This was just his mate&#39;s turn to be fucked. Maybe that&#39;s why Jake was confused. He must have forgotten whose turn it was to be fucked. He licked Marcus&#39;s ear, making him squirm and growl. His pussy twitched again at hearing his mate&#39;s voice. He could really make believable dog sounds when he was turned on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad, huh?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
Marcus shook his head. &quot;Woof!&quot; He smiled at Jake over his shoulder when Jake licked him again. &quot;Rrr. You know, I&#39;m not sure why, but that felt like the first time we had ever done that. Maybe it just hasn&#39;t felt that good in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake licked Marcus&#39;s ear again, earning another deep growl. &quot;It&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve both been in heat like this. Maybe that had something to do with it? When you were giving me those &#39;fuck me&#39; eyes and then your scent, man, I was helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus breathed deeply and leaned against Jake. &quot;Grrr. Good to know my charm still works on you, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />

Meanwhile, Luke Darner walked into the locker room. He had left Rocky in Coach David Erinson&#39;s office. Coach was using the private bathroom and told Luke to leave. He had been hoping to talk to Coach Erinson about a promotion. He figured he had been doing rather well the past couple of years as offensive coordinator. Surely he was ready for bigger responsibilities. Assistant Coach Darner had a nice ring to it. Oh well, he could always chat up Coach Erinson later. He grabbed a mop bucket and filled it with warm water. He then began to mop all along the floor of the locker room.<br />
<br />
Had Luke been paying any attention to the task at hand instead of the conversation he wanted to be having, he would have realized that he hadn&#39;t put any soap, cleaner, or disinfectant in the mop bucket. All he did was put hot water in it. Water doesn&#39;t clean on its own. It can move or spread dirt and grime around. And that&#39;s exactly what Luke ended up doing with everything that had been on the floor. Dirt, grime, sweat, and even the forgotten puddle of Coach Erinson&#39;s cum. Luke hadn&#39;t even noticed it. He just simply spread it all over the floor. t got on the mop and even into the mop bucket. Some of the water, each time he dropped the mop into the bucket, splashed out. It got onto his skin since he also wasn&#39;t wearing gloves. He mopped everywhere, by the lockers, along the tops of the benches, and even the floor of the shower, all with the intended goal of cleaning everything.<br />
<br />
Little by little, with each plunge of the mop, Luke found his dick to get more and more antsy. He felt a heat burning within him, but he couldn&#39;t pinpoint where it was coming from. It wasn&#39;t until he emptied the bucket and splashed more onto his arm, that he realized it was his pussy in need of attention. On a subconscious level, he could smell something pleasant in the air that made him even hornier. His dick, originally a respectable 8-incher, had grown to well past the footlong mark. His 14-inch manhood tented his running shorts at an obscene angle. His pussy was practically screaming for a dick to fill him up. He needed to take care of himself, but not before he told Coach Erinson that he was finished.<br />
<br />
Putting the mop and bucket away with the floor of the locker room still damp, Luke hurried back to Coach Erinson&#39;s office.</p>
