<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finding the right person online using a dating site is never really easy, even if they were a legit site. The Animalia Dating Forum was created to help those Animalians who could not find a compatible member of their race to become mates to find a human who could potentially be the mate they&#39;ve been looking for. However, a searching Animalian would still need to choose carefully. Even with Animalia&#39;s tighter cyber-security, there were still some profiles who weren&#39;t who they appeared to be. But the selection process often took some time, anyways.<br />
<br />
That was certainly true for Iphis and Ianthe. Not only were they looking for someone who would be interested in becoming an anaconda, but they were looking for someone who was openly bisexual. A bisexual was the best solution for the anaconda twins considering they shared a hermaphrodite body. And of course, someone who wouldn&#39;t mind sharing a partner would be very useful.<br />
<br />
Their requirements did narrow down the field a lot. Most of the people who responded to their profile lived in Los Angeles, a city that was known for its many eccentrics. But the two of them still had to work their way through the potential suitors and figure out which ones  were less ideal for their needs.<br />
<br />
Some people were easy to eliminate. Some had misinterpreted Iphis and Ianthe&#39;s profile and were too freaked out when they saw they were a two-headed snake. Some people just trigger any kind of spark, despite how politely they talked. There were also some people who sounded really dubious and made the anaconda twins want to steer clear from them. The &#39;prizewinner&#39; from that particular group was a particularly creepy guy who wanted to know if the twins were planning on building a harem. That one, Iphis and Ianthe actively blocked.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the two of them were able to narrow down the best candidates. Currently, the best options were two of the most likely people one could think of. Tyler, or Typhoon or Ty to his friends, was what most people would think of when they hear the word &#39;punk&#39;. The purple Mohawk, the multiple facial piercings, and the tattoos covering his arms all leaned heavily towards the punk image. Waterlily, on the other hand, could be described as &#39;a hippy who came a few decades too late&#39;. Her long hair, which was dyed a bright green, was often rather tangled and her large glasses magnified her eyes a lot, enough to make it easy to see when they were red from her latest joint.<br />
<br />
Despite their radically different appearances, Typhoon and Waterlily did have a few things in common, starting with deeper depths than their looks implied. Typhoon had come from a long line of sailors, going back to the beginning of colonization of the New World. When sailing ships lost their importance, his family served mostly in the US Navy. Typhoon&#39;s father was a strict naval officer, running his house like it was a clipper ship. His treating young Tyler as more of a crewman than a son obviously didn&#39;t allow a paternal bond to form between them. Typhoon left as soon as he was able and moved as far as he could from his father. While he did appear tough, there was still a friendly man under that exterior. And he hadn&#39;t abandoned his naval roots completely considering his arm tattoos were mostly of sea-related things.<br />
<br />
Waterlily was pretty much what she looked like. Her parents were hippies in the Age of Aquarius and they passed down their philosophies of freedom, peace, and harmony to their daughter. She was just as much a free spirit as her parents and blended right in with the odd people who live near Venice Beach. But there was a lot more to her than this. Behind those sometimes-walleyed eyes lies a shrewd intellect. She had an uncanny knack for seeing people for who they truly are and why they act the way they do. For instance, she could see Typhoon was such a punk because he wanted to distance himself away from his authoritative father, but the fact that he had marine-based tattoos showed that he still had a family connection and at least respected his ancestors if not his immediate family.<br />
<br />
What made them the most appealing is how they were already close to each other. Waterlily was able to see the hurting soul inside of Typhoon when she met him and helped brought out the nice guy in him. Despite how close they were, they did have an open relationship and were amicable to any man or woman who want to join. Bonding with a snake was a pretty interesting idea of its own. Iphis and Ianthe thought they had the most potential, bu they would still make sure. Humans went out on dates before determining that the one they&#39;re with is good enough to mate with for life. The twins&#39; bank account certainly had more than enough for Typhoon and Waterlily to be able to travel over to Lyre, if only for a few dates. But that may have to wait. Clara was recovering form her pregnancy and soon they may be heading back to Brazil.</p>
