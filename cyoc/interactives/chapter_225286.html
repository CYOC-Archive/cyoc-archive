<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With trepidation playing over his thoughts like shadows through a leafy canopy, Jake hovered the cursor over the custom change field. His choice wasn&#39;t random or borne of fancy; he found a perverse intrigue in flipping the dynamics of virility on its head. He intended a wry humor to belittle what society deemed masculine - a &#39;Hopping Mouse Penis&#39;, he expected an organ diminished to the comical scope of the tiny, innocuous creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see how &#39;mighty&#39; this makes me,&quot; he muttered to himself with an impish smirk. Surrendering to his curiosity, Jake typed the peculiar transformation and pressed &#39;Start&#39;.<br />
<br />
The changes didn&#39;t hit instantly – instead, they came as burgeoning waves coursing through. First, a peculiar itch upon his groin as an eruption of cream-tinted fur brushed outwards. He clenched his eyes shut, a reflex to the unbidden sensations, unaware of the metamorphosis continuing unabated.<br />
<br />
Crude hands cautiously grazed over the emerging tufts, mapped with thick wide-legged pants of rougher, darker fur. Flesh yielded to foreign shapes with disquieting elasticity, stretching and rounding into sturdy kangaroo-like appendages steadied on both sides of his scrotum.<br />
<br />
Then came the outlandish cloth hints – fibers sinuously weaved into existence around the virile figure taking hold where manhood had once presided. Inexplicable, a tiny cargo jacket fitted snugly over the rodent&#39;s frame, and atop its head, a cowboy hat materialized with a rugged charm.<br />
<br />
And unexpectedly, it was alive.<br />
<br />
A gravelly voice erupted, tinged with an unmistakable Australian brogue. &quot;Bloody hell, mate! What&#39;s this all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Its dazed, animated eyes flickered to life, attempting to reconcile with the predicament. A tail, endowed with a tuft of brown, curled from behind, ratifying its link as the new appendage owed existence to Jake&#39;s physiology.<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly, the mouse-man seemed to collect itself and stood tall, its expression twisting into annoyance. &quot;Oi! You there!&quot; It was peering over its shoulder, its gaze steadying on the wide-eyed beholder—Jake—whose face had contorted into an unrecognizable visage of astonishment and disbelief.<br />
<br />
Though startled beyond measure, Jake blurted out, &quot;I-I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d actually work... And talk! Why does it talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Visibly ireful, the mouse planted its newfound kangaroo-foot-hands onto its hips. &quot;What d&#39;ya expect, mate? You mess around with some bloody Chronivac thingamajig and poof – here I am! A talking, thinking, full-on kangaroo-rat where ya twig and berries used to be. And a stylish one at that, but that&#39;s not the point!&quot;<br />
<br />
Struggling to grasp the reality fragments tumbling around him, Jake staggered for words. &quot;I... sorry, I just... I thought—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You thought what? That it&#39;d be funny, yeah? Transform your manhood into a tiny rodent, good for a chuckle? Well, how&#39;s this for a riddle? What has two legs, a nifty jacket, and is rightly irked &#39;cause he&#39;s a fella&#39;s privates?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gulping audibly, Jake managed an apology. &quot;I’m sorry, mate. I can revert this, just hang on.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jake&#39;s hand trembled over the revert button, a curious weight settled over the confined space of his dorm room. The hopping mouse, with its coat ruffling under the jacket and hat casting a shadow over its earnest eyes, seemed to grasp the gravity of the situation with a clarity that belied its sudden and unusual creation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on, hold up just a tick,&quot; the hopping mouse said, its voice quivering slightly, an arresting vulnerability behind the gruff accent. &quot;You press that, and what? I&#39;m just... gone? Pfft, out like a flame?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake paused, the enormity of the situation forcing his breath to catch in his throat. The living manifestation of his whimsical desire was now confronting its mortality, its existence tethered to his choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I hadn&#39;t considered,&quot; Jake stammered, the shadow of guilt tinging his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, betcha didn&#39;t,&quot; the mouse retorted, a flicker of sadness in its demeanor. &quot;All fun and games, wasn&#39;t it? A bit of a laugh at the expense of yer buddy down under here... but now, it&#39;s got a bit real, hasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The mouse swiveled its head, taking in the sight of its own body, the room, and the befuddled human at the other end of its connection. &quot;I reckon I&#39;ve just got a taste of life, and the outback ain&#39;t never seen a critter like me. I don&#39;t fancy bein&#39; wiped just yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s hand slipped away from the computer, his moral compass spinning erratically. The air was thick with a new understanding, a bridge forming between two beings who shared an improbable origin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to do then?&quot; Jake asked, feeling an unexpected camaraderie with his articulate appendage.<br />
<br />
The hopping mouse&#39;s tail flicked pensively as Jake addressed it, the peculiarity of their situation hanging between them like some surreal fog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Righto,&quot; the mouse started, clearing its throat in a notably human gesture, &quot;a name, yeah? Suppose if I&#39;m sticking around, I should have something to be called by.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nodded. Anxious energy played at the corner of his lips as he tried to suppress the bizarreness of the scenario. &quot;Okay, so, any ideas? What do you feel like?&quot;<br />
<br />
The mouse pondered, its ears twitching atop its head as it modeled the hat with a certain rugged panache. &quot;Well, you&#39;re the bloke who brought me into this world, mate. Ever think of any good names for a dinky-di Aussie hopping mouse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scratching his head, Jake squinted at the miniature form before him. &quot;How about... Marlon? After Marlon Brando, because you definitely have some, uh, presence. And it&#39;s kind of ironic, given the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marlon the mouse nodded, seeming to roll the name around in his mind before he gave a tiny shrug of approval. &quot;Marlon it is then. Got a nice ring to it, that. Marlon the mouse. The one and only.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relief dispersed the tension in Jake&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Marlon,&quot; he repeated, the first faint smile since the transformation began easing the edges of his expression. &quot;It&#39;s good to meet you properly then, Marlon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you, Jake. Though, under less bewildering circumstances would&#39;ve been tops,&quot; Marlon quipped, the corners of his mouth turning upwards as much as mouse anatomy permitted.<br />
<br />
Marlon, with a settling sense of acceptance blooming within his newfound consciousness, gave an assertive nod toward Jake. &quot;Well, mate, reckon we should give the plumbing a whirl, see if this construct of yours can handle the necessities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s face flushed with a mix of embarrassment and intrigue, but he couldn&#39;t deny the practicality of checking the functionality. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go for it,&quot; he conceded, leading the way to the compact bathroom across the cold tiled floor of his dorm.<br />
<br />
At the threshold, Marlon instinctively reached for his tiny cargo jacket, carefully unbuttoning it with nimble digits that defied their rodent form. He slipped it off along with the cowboy hat, offering a half-cocked grin at Jake. &quot;Hold onto these for me, will ya? Don&#39;t want to sully the outfit. Bit of pride in appearances, even in... well, my state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake took the garments with a nod, delicately laying them aside. Marlon&#39;s muscular form, although diminutive and covered in fur, had the unquestionable definition of someone well-acquainted with physical activity—oddly fit for a creature that began life as the personification of a joke.<br />
<br />
Positioning themselves at the toilet, Jake took a deep breath and allowed nature to take its course. A stream of urine shot forth from Marlon&#39;s mouth, the mouse grimacing at the sensation but managing the situation with surprising dignity.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, Jake ceased the flow, looking to Marlon with hesitance sculpted into his features. &quot;Well, how was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could&#39;ve done without the weirdness, truth be told,&quot; Marlon answered, rinsing his mouth with a small cup of water provided by Jake before spitting it out. &quot;But it&#39;s not too bad. Something I reckon I could get my head around, given... well, given I don&#39;t have much choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence as both contemplated the odd normalcy they were attempting to sieve from the absurd. Then, a mutual nod passed between them as an unspoken agreement to proceed and finish what they started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best get on with it, then. Let&#39;s knock this on the head,&quot; Marlon stated, ever the pragmatist despite his peculiar circumstance.<br />
<br />
As Marlon spat out the last droplets, he caught his breath and hesitated before his next inquiry. &quot;This might be a bit forward, but, uh...&quot; he started, his tone edging on a mix of curiosity and suggestion, &quot;do you humans—do you ever... you know, have a tug?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake could feel his cheeks flushing, the warmth on his face a stark contrast to the cold tile beneath his feet. &quot;Uh, yeah. We do. It&#39;s... normal.&quot; He shuffled awkwardly, trying to make sense of the notion with the tiny, anthropomorphic creature before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How &#39;bout we give it a burl then?&quot; Marlon suggested, pausing to assess Jake&#39;s reaction. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s what you&#39;d usually do with a—well—with your part, innit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling every bit the surreal nature of the situation, Jake hesitated before consenting, his voice cautious. &quot;But I don&#39;t want to hurt you. Promise me you&#39;ll speak up if it&#39;s too much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it, mate. But don&#39;t you worry, I&#39;m tougher than I look.&quot; Marlon&#39;s chest puffed with bravado despite his diminutive size and unique embodiment of manhood.<br />
<br />
Jake tentatively reached out, starting with a gentle massage that initially made Marlon squirm. The hopping mouse-entity laughed, the sensation oddly thrilling in its ticklishness. &quot;Don&#39;t you worry about a spine here, mate; I&#39;m all muscle!&quot;<br />
<br />
Encouraged by the lack of pain and Marlon&#39;s quips about being &quot;spineless,&quot; Jake continued, the motions becoming more fluid and confident as he maneuvered around the furry form. Marlon&#39;s laughter subsided, replaced by deep breaths that hinted at building pleasure.<br />
<br />
Before long, both were caught up in the rise of arousal—Marlon growing taut under Jake&#39;s touch, shivering with a combination of eagerness and anticipation. As the tension built to its inevitable apex, Jake thought to grab some toilet paper, positioning it just in time for Marlon&#39;s climactic release.<br />
<br />
The rodent&#39;s body convulsed, and Jake could see the intensity of the moment etched on Marlon&#39;s face as semen shot forth from his mouth. As the wave of relief washed over them both, Jake delicately cleaned up, a new kind of understanding settling in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how was it?&quot; Jake inquired once the euphoria had subsided, concern veiling his curiosity.<br />
<br />
Marlon exhaled slowly, the remnants of his delight ebbing away as he caught his breath. &quot;Mate,&quot; he replied with a satisfied sigh, &quot;that was bloody brilliant. Didn&#39;t hurt one bit; felt like the real thing, I reckon. Better than I ever imagined a life like this could be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake, still processing their latest adventure, acknowledged Marlon&#39;s request and carefully maneuvered them both toward the large mirror affixed to the back of his dorm room door. The reflection that greeted them was nothing short of fantastical—a surreal melding of man and anthropomorphic creature, entwined in an existence that defied biology and leaned heavily into the realm of the extraordinary.<br />
<br />
Marlon, at his core, could have passed for any character out of a whimsical animated series, had it not been for his position affixed to Jake&#39;s crotch. His body, covered in a fine, creamy fur, sported well-defined legs that bifurcated Jake&#39;s scrotum, each equipped with sturdy, kangaroo-like limbs and planted firmly to the left and right. His toes, tipped with dark, non-retractable claws, flexed instinctively as he observed himself, an intriguing adaptation that whispered of his unique dexterity.<br />
<br />
Above these powerful appendages, Marlon&#39;s arms were fully formed and surprisingly human in their anatomy, boasting the same dark claws at the fingertips. They hung by his sides, showcasing a strength and readiness that was comically juxtaposed with his current role. His face, dominated by large, expressive eyes akin to those seen in a children&#39;s cartoon, shimmered with life and personality. The ears above were sizable and expressive, their position and movements mirroring Marlon&#39;s every mood—a clear tell of his wide range of emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Golly, look at me,&quot; Marlon murmured, struck by the full reality—the entirety of his being on display. He rotated his arms, watched his ears flick to convey his wonder, and his eyes roving over each feature. Even his tail, with its tuft of a brown tip, emanated from his backside, adding another layer of apparel to the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... something else,&quot; Jake agreed, his voice tinged with a blend of awe and bafflement. &quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re straight out of a comic book, except... you know, attached to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Marlon chuckled, the oddity of their connection not lost on him. &quot;You know, mate, if anyone had told me I&#39;d end up a &#39;part&#39; of another bloke like this, I would&#39;ve said they&#39;re a few roos loose in the top paddock. But here I am, part and parcel of you. Fancier than a pouch rat on a holiday!&quot;</p>
