&quot;Ain&#39;t nobody answering the door, you sure this was the location, Sarg?&quot;<br />
&quot;You heard the dispatcher, Millsberry daycare center.&quot; A gruffy old cop scruffs back.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I heard them. What do you think is going on here anyways?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell if I know, report was that the &#39;kids were growing&#39; or something? In anycase, the fact that no one has answered the door yet is suspicious in itself.&quot;<br />
&quot;You figuring we should bust it open? Call the squad over?&quot;<br />
&quot;How about we check out back first.&quot; The Sargent snapped back.<br />
With that, the two cops made it to the back wooden fence of the daycare. Peeking over they saw a ring formed of small kids of various ages.<br />
&quot;What in tarnation!&quot; The old cop barked.<br />
&quot;What is it, Sarg?&quot;<br />
The old cop pointed to the center of the ring. Taking a focus glace, the deputy saw the cause for the outburst. In the center of the ring laid three naked ladies faced down, with a young naked little boy before them, sucking his thumb.<br />
&quot;Get an ambulance over here, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
When the caretakers were taken into custody. They each decided to fabricated a story of an unknown perpetrator that snuck into the backyard, and raped them. There cream filled vagina validated their story, and ushered a fruitless manhunt for a man that wouldn&#39;t exist for another two decades. When questioning the toddlers, each one stated that &#39;Tommy and Jessie&quot; got big. Of course the investigators couldn&#39;t understand the reason behind this belief, and ultimately dismissed it as a coping mechanism for trauma.<br />
Even though the caretakers recalled their story in a horrified fashion, it couldn&#39;t be farther form how they really felt. They longed for the day Tommy would embrace them once more. Even though their bodies had reverted, the passion they felt still burned in their heart. Knowing that Tommy had reverted back into a toddler made them each breathe a heavy sigh. If only they had that device, they can relive that moment once more.<br />
Sharon being the youngest, knew if she kept her body well, she can become quite a cougar once Tommy becomes a teenager. Kathy and Maria were a different case. They had long since past their prime, and would become undesirable once Tommy had come to age naturally.<br />
Tommy when he reverted back into a toddler, his mindset shifted back as well. While it was not like he forgotten about everything, the details were extremely hazy. He knew he was doing something really fun with Jessie and the caretakers, but couldn&#39;t really remember what. He thought he was using his peeper, but why? These questions stumped Tommy, and like a normal toddler, he moved on from the incident without much care. He had no idea it was basically his destiny to become a stud, and one day he could be fucking a different girl every night. But for now, he was complacent in playing with his toys truck.<br />
<br />
But what happened to Jessie and the device? Well Jessie was back home with her family, the house rattling about the incident at the daycare. The grumpy 4-year old red-head sat down with a furrowed face, and crossed arms.<br />
&quot;Billy such a meanie! Taking my remote!&quot; She grumbled to herself. With that Jessie began to recall the events that unfolded that day.<br />
<br />
Tommy had just gave Jessie the sex machine. Making her way to in the daycare through the back door, she was anxious to try the remote on the guest that were waiting.<br />
&quot;Hey Jessie! Want to use that remote on me?&quot; A voice peeped behind her.<br />
Turning her curvaceous body around, she saw Billy looking up at her with a grin. &quot;I don&#39;t think so!&quot; She scoffed at the little 8-year old boy.<br />
&quot;Why not!&quot; He moaned, &quot;I want to have fun too!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because your an asshole Billy!&quot; Jessie answered, remembering all the time Billy picked and teased her. &quot;Now why don&#39;t you be a good boy for once and buzz off, or else I&#39;m going to give you the spanking you deserved all this time!&quot; Jessie declared.<br />
Billy trembled as the adult red-headed beauty scolded him as she towered over him.<br />
Suddenly Jessie yelped as her body shrunk a bit. &quot;Uh oh!&quot; Jessie gasped as her body plummeted downward. It was as if she was going down on a elevator. Billy watched are her massive breast receded back into her chest, becoming flat as a board. Her hips narrow, along with her flattening ass. Her limbs became stubby once more, and she now stood shorter than Billy himself.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; She squeaked, and her mind began to readjust back to a toddler. She then felt the device get swept off her hand. Billy smiled as he gripped the machine. &quot;Hey! Give it back you poopoo head!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so shorty!&quot; Billy laughed pushing her to the ground.<br />
Jessie catching herself, looked up at Billy with the machine.<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll use this later!&quot; He declared, stuffing it into his backpack.<br />
The rest of the day played out. Jessie found some spare clothes in a nearby bin. As the cop scourged the place, their parents were called to pick them up. Each kid was eventually sent home.<br />
Billy sat on his bed, opening his backpack. Holding the machine in his hand, he wondered what he should do with it...</p>
