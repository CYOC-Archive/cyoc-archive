<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everyone was gathered around the fire, no one really saying a word as humans and horses alike all processed what had happened to one of each of their numbers and what was likely happening to them. Lying by the fire were two passed out centaurs. One had been the mare, Snow, now she was a white-haired centaur with the upper body of a rather attractive human women. The other was the red haired and freckled young man who had “owned” snow, Luke. His human body had changed to become physically fitter and with horse ears, but the main change was the reddish brown with some black near the hooves body of a horse. <br />
<br />
Some of them had found that they had already started to change in small ways but those two had finished leaving humanity/horse kind behind in a rush and now lay passed out on the grass. <br />
<br />
No one said much of anything as some of them drifted off to sleep since it had been a long day before this whole thing started. They were, however smart enough to keep a watch in case anyone came around or they saw any sign of human life on this strange world. <br />
<br />
“We need to keep an eye on Luke.” Stated Wendy as she looked toward Amanda as the two of them shared a watch. <br />
<br />
“What…” inquired Amanda confused by this line of thinking, she and she assumed everyone else was focusing on what they could change into. <br />
<br />
“We need to watch Luke.” Restated Wendy her voice just above a whisper. “Wasn’t Snow showing signs she was about to enter heat?”<br />
Amanda paused and considered. <br />
<br />
“We don’t even know if centaur’s go into heat.” Stated Amanda “Also even so we don’t know if Luke would find Snow hot.”<br />
<br />
Wendy raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Please, Luke is an anime fan, I have seen him wearing those shirts and she looks like a lot of those types of characters.” Stated Wendy as Amanda admitted to herself that Wendy was right. With her snow white hair and deep blue eyes she did have a sort of anime character look. “What is that term I heard him talk about once wifu or waifu? She looks like one of those.”<br />
<br />
“I think we have more things to worry about then that.” Stated Amanda <br />
<br />
“Still I made this.” stated Wendy as she held up a bra she had made for Wendy using the remains of the shirt and sweatshirt that Luke had been wearing. His shirt had ripped opened when his body began to change and the main like strip of hair which ran down his spin contenting the human hair to the horse body. “Better to not have a nude women walking around, I wish we could do something about Luke’s new horse junk but I never heard of a horse jockstrap and I don’t have the material to make one.”<br />
<br />
“What…what is happening.” Said a new voice as Snow, the former horse now centaur women struggled to sit up with her new body. She no longer could just raise her neck from a resting position but had to use her arms which was strange to her to help herself up.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back.” Said Amanda as she got up and moved toward Snow, Snow’s blue eyes where wide in confusion. “What do you remember?”<br />
<br />
“I…” started Snow, before her hands moved up and touched her face and new body. “I can speak? I have a human body?”<br />
<br />
“At least the upper half.” Added Wendy as she came forward, with the bra in hand. “Here, this will help.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Snow as Wendy helped put it on the former horse. It was slightly too small, Wendy had guessed the size so it was slightly too tight but it would work. “What happened, how do I know how to speak and everything else?”<br />
<br />
“We don’t know.” Explained Amanda “What do you know?”<br />
<br />
“It is strange, I know how to speak when before I could only remember knowing a few words, my name and the like but now I think back and remember everything that was said.” Stated Snow “I even remember things I had long forgotten, like my mother’s fur color and the like.”<br />
<br />
“Whatever changed you and Luke and whatever is changing us must have done something to your memories and mind.” Stated Amanda “You can’t learn a whole new language in a few hours yet alone sudden remember so much.”<br />
<br />
“It’s more than that.” Stated Snow as she looked toward some grass. “I could have eaten that as a horse, it would have been an ok meal, something to snack on but I know now that is something I can’t eat.”<br />
<br />
“What about these?” inquired Amanda as she held up some berries they had found. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Snow “Can I have some?”<br />
<br />
“Please, you have gone through a lot.” Confirmed Amanda as Snow took a handful and began to chew with her new human teeth. <br />
<br />
“I better get more.” Stated Wendy as she stood up. “There is a patch right over there and I need to use the bathroom anyhow.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, just wash your hands before you pick the berries in the river.” Stated Amanda as Wendy nodded before walking off into the darkness. <br />
<br />
She didn’t have to go far, she found the spot they had set up as the “bathroom” area and quickly dropped her pants. <br />
<br />
She expected the normal stuff that happened everything she went to the bathroom. However instead when the release came instead of waste she felt something else burst out. A long thick black hair horse tail now graced her back end.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…” cursed Wendy as a new smell reached her nose. It was a smell she knew very well from her years around horses. It was the scent that came from a mare in heat and she was the mare. <br />
<br />
She was in heat.</p>
