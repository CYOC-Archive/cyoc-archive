<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up with my heart pounding and sweat pouring off of me. I looked around in a panicked state until I realized I was in my bedroom. I heaved a sigh of relief and flopped back down on my bed. That had to have been some nightmare though I couldn&#39;t remember what it was. All I could remember was the certain feeling that I was about to die. It must have had something to do with Gale&#39;s death. We were friends basically since birth though Gale had been born Greg. Before school started Greg had been diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. I remember my parents being shocked when Greg came over in girl clothes and insisted he be called Gale. I hadn&#39;t seen anything wrong with it and stayed friends with her. Not everyone was as kind though and a couple weeks ago she was killed by a rapist who thought she was a &quot;true&quot; girl. The police didn&#39;t go into detail but her parents had to have a closed casket funeral for her.<br />
<br />
I sat back up and shook my head. I needed to get ready for school. It was the second day of school and I didn&#39;t want to be late. Today would be the day classes officially started with yesterday being a type of orientation. So I got out of bed and went over to the bathroom that me and my older sister shared between our rooms. When I heard the water running I slid the door open a crack so I could see Carol get out. I knew I shouldn&#39;t be doing it but I did have a reason. I was trying to get my dick hard which hadn&#39;t happened yet. Here I was at sixteen and I didn&#39;t know what it was like to have an erection. I kept that quiet since I was sure to be teased by it. Of course looking at my sister wasn&#39;t the only way I tried. I tried looking at porn of all sorts but there was just no reaction. At first I thought I might have been gay but gay porn didn&#39;t do anything either. It had become quite irritating as I listened to my friends talk about the girls they&#39;ve done and each time all of them would get an erection just from listening to the stories. The only exception being me of course but I lied and told them that it gave me an erection which I suppose the others could be lying too. So here I was watching my sister getting out of the shower hoping that I could get hard.<br />
<br />
Just as my sister got out of the shower I got a crazy idea and opened the door all the way. She let out a surprised yelp and quickly covered herself up with a towel yelling, &quot;Close the door Sam!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was about to close the door when I heard my mom behind me say, &quot;I had hoped you&#39;d be better than that Sam.&quot; The tone in her voice was disappointed and angry. &quot;Take your shower while I talk with your sister.&quot; With that she led my sister into her room through the other door.<br />
<br />
It was with a little confusion that I took my boxers off and got in the shower. Why would my mom talk with my sister? Shouldn&#39;t she be talking to me? Of course I wasn&#39;t really complaining that she wasn&#39;t talking to me about it. If she did I might have to mention my problem which would be really embarrassing. How would I even explain it to her? What was worse was she might take me to see the doctor which would be even more embarrassing. As I showered I tried jacking off like I saw in the porn I watched. I imagined that I was having sex with some of the women in the porn videos and even tried imagining having sex with my sister. Nothing I did however worked and my dick remained limp. With a sigh I finished my shower and steeped out. I quickly dried off and with a towel wrapped around my waist I went back into my room.<br />
<br />
I was surprised to see my mom and sister in my room. &quot;What are you two doing in my room?&quot; I asked looking from one to the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I decided on your punishment and your sister is going to help you with it,&quot; my mom said in that tone of voice that said you had better do it or the punishment would be worse. &quot;Now get ready and do as your sister tells you.&quot; With that she left my room closing the door.<br />
<br />
As soon as my mom was gone I turned to my sister and asked, &quot;So what&#39;s my punishment?&quot;<br />
<br />
My sister picked a couple things up off my bed and said, &quot;You have to wear these for the rest of the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the articles of clothing looked like a black tank top but the straps were too thin and the other article was a pair of black panties with a little bow in front and the word ROCKER in glittery letters on the back. &quot;I can&#39;t wear those,&quot; I said in shock. &quot;Boys don&#39;t wear panties and I&#39;m not sure what that is but I bet it&#39;s for girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
My sister held the one article of clothing up and said, &quot;This is called a camisole or more commonly a cami and you&#39;re right that it&#39;s mainly worn by girls. Now you will wear them or Mom will make sure everyone knows about your limp dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was mortified that my mom knew about that. &quot;H-h-how?&quot; I asked trying to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom heard you talking in your sleep about it a few times,&quot; my sister said with a caring look. &quot;I take it that&#39;s why you were watching me?&quot; When I nodded she asked, &quot;No reaction at all?&quot; After I shook my head she sighed and said, &quot;You should go see Doctor Horn. She may be able to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; I said looking down. If my mom knew about my problem then why hadn&#39;t she taken me to the doctor?<br />
<br />
&quot;For now though you need to take your punishment,&quot; my sister said with a little smirk. &quot;Be glad I was able to talk Mom out of having you wear a blouse and skirt also. Now take off that towel and bend over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I need to bend over?&quot; I asked really confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do it,&quot; my sister said growing a little impatient. I did as she said and then she came up behind me. Reaching around she pushed my balls up into my body saying, &quot;You need to have a smooth front wearing these so your balls go up and,&quot; she grabbed my dick from behind pulling it between my legs and up my butt crack, &quot;your dick goes between your legs and your ass cheeks. Now you can stand up but keep those ass cheeks clenched around your dick so it doesn&#39;t slip. This is what&#39;s called tucking. Gale told me about it one time when I asked her how she had a flat front. Then we can put the panties on.&quot;<br />
<br />
I did as instructed expecting to feel pain in my dick but surprisingly there was no pain. It felt odd sure but it also felt comfortable for some reason. Once I put the panties on I said, &quot;I think these are too small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not small,&quot; my sister said with a smile, &quot;that&#39;s how they&#39;re made. They&#39;re designed to wear around the hips instead of the waist. And they fit you as good as they fit me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean these are your panties?&quot; I asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course they are,&quot; my sister said rolling her eyes. &quot;Where else did you think we&#39;d get them on such short notice? I doubt you would want to wear Mom&#39;s panties and her&#39;s wouldn&#39;t have fit you like mine do. Now put on the cami. It&#39;s just like putting on a shirt. Then you can get dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I did as I was told and soon I was dressed for school. As we walked out of my room I asked, &quot;What am I supposed to say when people find out I&#39;m wearing my sister&#39;s panties and cami?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they won&#39;t know you&#39;re wearing panties unless yo take off your pants,&quot; my sister said with a smile. &quot;They may notice the cami but they may convince themselves that you&#39;re wearing a tank top underneath.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if I have to use the restroom?&quot; I asked wondering how I would hide wearing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just go into a stall and sit down like you have to take a shit,&quot; my sister said with a shrug. &quot;Keep your pants up a little bit to hide the panties and you should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But people will see when I have to change for P.E.&quot; I said dreading that moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;ll just have to tell them the truth,&quot; my sister said almost giggling. &quot;You&#39;re being punished for spying on me while I was nude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I had to hope that when the time came the guys will believe me about being punished. If not then there would be a lot of teasing. I really wasn&#39;t looking forward to the rest of the week.</p>
