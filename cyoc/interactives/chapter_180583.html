<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ohhh...man, that...that may have been an error...&quot; Kendall moaned as he woke up the next morning, about an hour earlier than he usually did for school. He stretched and realized he was sitting, naked, on the couch that his dad usually did when he had beers late at night. Kendall didn&#39;t remember much outside of having about three drinks before bed, but the realization he had imbibed that much hit him like a wall of bricks. He didn&#39;t drink! He didn&#39;t drink at all! But he...he kinda DID, last night. He tried to tell himself it was the last time, but at the same time, he realized that despite sleeping without covers, without any blankets at all, he&#39;d been pretty comfortable sleeping like that.<br />
<br />
Getting up and yawning, Kendall figured he had a bit of time to shower up and hopefully get the alcohol stench off of himself. He couldn&#39;t well go to school with himself smelling like a bordello. Thankfully, he didn&#39;t feel all that much of a hangover if any at all. It seemed his body was going easy on him. Thinking back to last night, he remembered the &quot;study session&quot; he had with Allison, and eagerly anticipated the third period today - where he would be more than capable to join her in the study rooms in the library.<br />
<br />
Technically, he was supposed to use those quiet, noise-sealed rooms to study. But it wouldn&#39;t be the first time Kendall instead filled in his time there with sex. Rooms like that had a bit of significance to Kendall - after all, he distinctly remembered his first time masturbating even now. He&#39;d been in one of those rooms, studying, and discovered, while bored, just how good his manhood felt. And ever since he developed his talents and uses for his growing hidden capability.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and I have had quite the selection of erotic adventures.&quot; He said toward his cock with a grin, nudging it - and in the process feeling it start to stir. He shook his head however and said, &quot;Nope, sorry, I&#39;m gonna be holding back my stamina for my academic adventures in anatomy and the biology of sexual reproduction with Allison today.&quot; He marched upstairs, content to enjoy his shower if he wasn&#39;t going to quite indulge himself yet.<br />
<br />
It was what he saw in the shower room that made him pause and take things in.<br />
<br />
He saw himself, but...better. His shoulders looked a little more broad than usual, his pecs actually developed some tone and - even though he didn&#39;t care for the smattering of hair there - he couldn&#39;t deny the shape to his chest was quite aesthetically pleasing. His stomach was tight and toned, and flexing it showed him six thin but very nicely toned abs. Kendall examined further, tilting his head as he watched his biceps bulge up a little bit. Usually he lacked for arm strength - not any more.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t exactly a jock. By no stretch of the imagination. But he was definitely pleased with his bodily development. He looked around and saw his butt seemed a little thicker, stronger, complimenting his thighs and quads, and even his calves seemed a little stronger than usual. &quot;My, could this be some sort of late puberty muscle related growth spurt? And I didn&#39;t even notice?&quot; He cupped his chin, &quot;Merits further research and logging of any further evidence. But I will file this under &quot;feels pretty damn good&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, he looked forward to making use of his new musculature in his upcoming biological congress with Allison.<br />
<br />
Kendall remembered however that she disliked hair, and when he checked, he saw he had even, rather oddly attractive stubble on his chin and jawline. His underarms had light bushes of hair, and there was a line heading up from a thick bush at his groin. Right up to his nicely formed chest, a few little hairs coming out near his nipples.<br />
<br />
Before he could shower, he needed to take care of this. A quick trip back to his parents&#39; room, and registering the odd feeling therein as he had before, Kendall retrieved a razor usually used by his mother. He didn&#39;t even think anything of using it - cleaning out the razor before readying it and some shaving cream. He propped himself up in his own shower room, and started commencing - noting as he went through it felt oddly natural. As if shaving his body and facial hair was kind of normal for him.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t had to do this before though... he shrugged and figured he was just a natural at this. Kendall pondered if he might need to exhibit some preparedness, considering what happened last night. He went ahead and packed the razor and a container of shaving cream in with his school bags. Not even considering that the only people who needed to do so usually were athletes and gym jocks.<br />
<br />
With that taken care of, Kendall jumped in the shower, gasping as he felt the cold water move into being more warm. The sheer feeling of water on his body almost made him feel the need to just...alleviate some of the pressure in his groin. Fuck, why was he feeling so ready to go this morning? Usually he had a better handle on his libido than this. He shook his head and just let his erect manhood hang there. He was under no obligation to take care of it then and there.<br />
<br />
By the time he got done, he had calmed down more or less by force.<br />
<br />
The cold air upon stepping out of the shower did it more or less. Kendall was still pretty much half-hard though. He got into his clothes in his room, feeling kind of odd stepping into his own room for a brief moment before the feeling vanished. He dressed in a looser, larger set of clothes than usual. Figuring that he would find his usual apparel a tighter, more uncomfortable fit this morning. &quot;Maybe...I could actually try in PE today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall shrugged and headed downstairs - where instead of his usual breakfast, he found himself gravitating more toward chicken and beef meals his parents had in the fridge, noting as he did that he enjoyed this more than his usual calorie loaded meals. It took a bit longer to get himself filled up, but once breakfast was done, Kendall took care of his usual hygiene routine before readying his bags. He had a bit more free time today to enjoy time to himself.<br />
<br />
By the time Kendall was due to head out to school, something about this all just seemed odd to him. Ah well. Maybe it was his new little muscles coming in. He walked with a deal more pep in his step than usual, smiling broadly and with his shoulders spread out, chest forward. Definite better displayed confidence today than he usually had.<br />
<br />
Allison was herself walking to school with Lisa, her best friend. Lisa was a green eyed red head who Allison had been friends with for the longest time. They were both on the cheer team, and often chatted about boys and other topics. Lisa&#39;s status as Allison&#39;s confidant gave her a pretty unique social status in the school - one she took advantage of to date more than a few of the athletes over her time there. Lisa looked over at Kendall and gasped a little, &quot;Girlfriend, we have got to talk about Kendall. Look at him! So much confidence, dare I say cockiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he does have quite a gift.&quot; Allison said with a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you&#39;ve bragged to me.&quot; Lisa responded, and said, &quot;But he&#39;s looking so mature this morning! ...You know, Carlton doesn&#39;t seem to be very interested in our relationship. Would you mind if I borrowed your hot nerd?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Find your own, Lisa.&quot; Allison chuckled, not taking it all that seriously. But even as she did look at Kendall, she found herself growing even more interested indeed. Maybe it was just her eyes or the early morning light - but she swore that Kendall was looking downright stunning this morning. She&#39;d need to talk to him or more as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
First period history with Mr. Clark had quite an eclectic and large range of students. A range of students whose names included all those who had had quite an interesting time courtesy of the wishing machine. In the front row was Wes and Diego, a row back was Bryan, and two rows back from him was Ross. Though it seemed nobody found the new brotherly relationship between Ross and Bryan to be all that weird. Kendall took a seat in the back, seeming to need to adjust his seat this morning.<br />
<br />
But there was a lot that Mr. Clark found weird that morning.<br />
<br />
When he woke up and got ready for his job at the school, he noted a few things. His midsection seemed tighter, the muscles he swore had just been &quot;the pump&quot; seemed to be there to stay, and even his butt and legs seemed in better shape than they would&#39;ve otherwise been. And what was more, his hair seemed thicker, the silvery hair fuller and looking somewhat odd. Alex had flexed his biceps for his reflection before remembering what happened the prior night.<br />
<br />
The incident with Chad Owens.<br />
<br />
After it had happened, he had been downright shocked he so easily went along with it. He understood why he did. But to go along so quickly and without argument... Well, he had been lonely, and his wife was long gone, and Chad had been quite persuasive. He had even aired his insecurity afterwards. He had been entirely straight before then, and had never even once thought about sexual relations with a man. Being that Alex was older, he even thought briefly that having sex with a man would scandalize or ruin him - before he remembered that this was the 21st century.<br />
<br />
Chad had been surprisingly open about it - that he himself identified as &quot;mostly straight&quot;. He had a number of girlfriends and was known for striking up casual encounters with people he met at the gym. But that even while he did mostly have sex with women, he felt an undeniable sexual attraction to older men. Alex himself hadn&#39;t really gotten it - he grew up with the idea that sexuality was either straight or gay. No inbetweens or permutations allowed.<br />
<br />
Which had contributed in large part to his issues with the encounter.<br />
<br />
Chad had assured him though - and even grinned and said that he could tell any woman Alex hooked up with would definitely not be disappointed by the cock on him. That had perked Alex up a bit. This stunning specimen of masculine muscularity thought he wasn&#39;t exactly the fuddy he took himself to be.<br />
<br />
Alex lowered his arms and examined his face before applying his usual lotion. The wrinkles seemed less deep today, and he looked healthier all around. He got dressed and packed his lunch and mid-meals for the day, noting as he did he went with some healthier food in general than just chips grabbed from the snack cabinet. He figured he needed to keep to the diet Chad assigned him.<br />
<br />
By the time Alex got to school, he was rather surprised by his reception. &quot;Good morning, Mr. Clark, you&#39;re looking good this morning.&quot; &quot;Wow, are you dieting, Mr. Clark? Looking great!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re in SUCH good shape! What&#39;s your secret?&quot; Even the younger teachers had been complimenting him. The sheer attention almost made him spring a boner, but thankfully Alex had better self control than that. He went ahead to his class and swore under his breath as he looked at Wes, Bryan and Kendall.<br />
<br />
Something seemed...different. Was he the only one that could see it? Was Bryan always this dark skinned? And Wes too! Maybe Kendall had just been doing some extra push ups at night. But Alex was hit with a sense of &quot;this isn&#39;t normal&quot;. Was he SERIOUSLY the only one who noticed these things? He decided - even as he began class - he would need to check in with Wes, Bryan and Kendall and see if about his suspicions. Sure they might feel everything was fine, but did they notice these things at all...?</p>
