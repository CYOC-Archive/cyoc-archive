<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken had but one chance and now was the right time if ever it was to be true! Remembering the pattern he'd seen set up many a time before in practice runs, Ken punched in the codes.<br />
<br />
His personal over dedication to myths and legends had him seeking the one true and only desire in his life, Circe!  Planned out to the finest detail he was ready to meet this witch. Garlic, Moly, and assorted spices gave him the foolish courage to think himself equal or better than Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time, Date, a corridor of time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;31 years before the fall of Troy, during the Spring of the year.......&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly the machine began to whirl as lights spun making maddening patterns about the room. Ken took the hand grips made to stead one's self while passing through time. Even as he stepped onto the grid he felt the winds of time rush him to his destiny.<br />
<br />
The last thing he saw was Allen running into the room and screaming the word, &quot;NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly he was sitting there looking around, himself as he was only now on the beach of the isle of Aeanea. The blazing hot Sun above told him he was now in the tropics. A blue green ocean stretched to the horizon. <br />
<br />
Then words of men, but said in what he knew was Greek. Ken understood not a word of Greek, his great plan was foiled! Getting to his feet he went toward the sounds of speach. Creeping up to a rise overlooking the inner parts of this island he saw a group of not less than twenty men or maybe sailors. <br />
<br />
One man led them as he pointed his sword to the white stone buildings not far inland from where he stood. As the men tramped inland so also did Ken as he followed as some distance.<br />
<br />
It was like he imagined, the men went up onto the great porch and met Circe. Oh but she was as he'd long believed, tall, slender of build with well endowed chest. She walked with such grace when beckoning the men into her palace. As Ken expected they followed, and soon were out of sight.<br />
<br />
Ken worked his way ever closer to the palace. A hedge served him well as he made the way toward Circe's vast gardens. Peering past the hedge he watched as a large and dark figured man dragged a black goat by a rope noosed about it's long neck. <br />
<br />
It was then as the man being angered with the goat for not being willingly led by him, did turn to face both billy goat and Ken. A gasp of fear from Ken's mouth was all that be needed when he saw the dark figured man's face.<br />
<br />
Ken turned to run from this terrible place but before he took six steps the noose of a rope touched his neck.  Yanking had to be free he soon was put upon by five pretty maidens.  This would have instilled Ken to go in peace if it were not for the fact each girl was also part and part animal as well.<br />
<br />
Speaking in Greek they coaxed at him to allow them to tie and bind him . One was as part nanny goat, while another looked to be a sweet young heifer. Ken's mouth dropped as one was part pony mare while still another was part Tiger. Furry hands and soft voices cooed him into a soothing calmness.<br />
<br />
At last Ken was dragged along and soon found himself standing and looking at Circe. She smiled a friendly expression as the maidens told of their capture. <br />
<br />
Circe reached her right hand out and touched Ken's forehead. She closed her eyes and then quickly opened them as she spoke. &quot;You have come from the future! Your brave and foolish wish to meet me the Daughter of the Sun, and what is so silly I envision your possible time of escape. Untie him except for his hands!&quot; commanded Circe.<br />
<br />
She was now speaking perfect King's English and what was even more odd the maidens seemed to also understand her words. Pointing the way Ken followed behind Circe. They walked along the white stoned pathway till Ken stopped and starred.<br />
<br />
There spreading out before him was a sunken mudhole with dozens of wallowing sows and boars grunting and squealing. The din of their noise made Ken feel sick as also the smell of the mire below made his stomach turn into a knot.<br />
<br />
Turning to Ken Circe pointed to one large black boar as it was mounted up and into the rear of a squealing sow.<br />
<br />
&quot;See the first mate, he be a fine big black boar! See too his Captian a less than thrilled sow that is just now feeling the beastly urges of his swined' form. The others here were as you all men who came to visit me and will never again leave this isle.&quot; explained Circe.<br />
<br />
The seat was dripping from Ken's forehead as Circe stepped closer to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I trust these here don't thrill you as expected? Dear Kenneth, would you not wish to also be a big boar down there below? I offer you the gift of a lifetime if you will only serve me in the ways I may desire you to serve. Come now and accept my generous offer!&quot; beckoned Circe as the maidens ringed around Ken.<br />
<br />
Ken stood scared stiff as three maidens held out knives. In just seconds they cut and ripped his clothing till he stood there before all, naked!<br />
<br />
Circe began to walk a circle about Ken as he stood there with a stiffening erection and goosepimples popping. Turning his head to watch Circe Ken suddenly felt a wild and wonderous touch.<br />
<br />
Looking quickly down Ken watched at one pretty maiden fondled his balls and stroked him to one stiff erection. Ken begged her not to but she paid him no mind and continued her work. As Ken's stiff rod was mouthed by the maiden he closed his eyes drinking in the sensual delight.<br />
<br />
Ken wondered if this sensual touch was to be his last human feeling as he thought of the first mate humping his sow Captain. <br />
<br />
Circe bent close and whispered into Ken's ear, &quot;This be your last sexual thrill ! Bend, contort, change my young suitor, your human form gives way to a body of scales and fluid movement! Down, down, down go you and be till I speak otherwise a guard for my great house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken felt his body melt as the strength build about himself. Looking up he watched as Circe and the Maidens all looked to giants. Turning his head he tried to speak but only hissed his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now a snake to comb the palace for rodents and rabbits! In the dark of night you shall curl up into tree limbs and await my beckoned call! Guard you shall this house and do as I say, then if you are dilligent a different form can you be, someday!&quot; said Circe as ken slither off into the grass.</p>
