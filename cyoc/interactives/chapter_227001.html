<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melanie stood against the wall and stared at Jed in shock, continuing to cover her privates as best she could.<br />
&quot;What are you doing? Get out!&quot; she screamed.<br />
&quot;Shhh&quot; Jed whispered. &quot;Animals don&#39;t talk&quot;<br />
&quot;Stop saying that, I&#39;m not an animal! Just leave me alone!&quot;<br />
Jed continued to creep into the bathroom, ignoring Melanie&#39;s demands, a look of desire in his eyes. She was his now and soon she would understand that.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make this hard on yourself, Mel&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed moved closer, but Melanie managed to get the jump on him and with a swift kick to his shins she was able to throw him off balance, shove him back into the bathroom door and out of her way.  Jed tumbled backwards to the floor, cursing to himself in pain but also feeling excited at this little challenge his new plaything was proving to be. Melanie raced past him and headed straight to her bedroom. Jed stood back up, wincing slightly from his bruised legs and walked back towards the bathroom to collect his spell books. If his plaything wasn&#39;t going to behave like a good girl he was just going to have to make some adjustments to her body and personality to bring out that side of her.<br />
When he reached the bathroom, he gathered up the spell books from his bag and quickly read over the frog transformation spell, deciding that would be a nice way to demonstrate his power over Melanie. Then he walked towards his housemates room and prepared to cast his spell. <br />
<br />
Melanie, meanwhile felt a degree of safety locked in her room. Jed wasn&#39;t trying to break the door down and seemed to have accepted he was defeated, for now at least. She noticed something else that had shocked her though. Her suitcase had been ransacked and every item of clothing removed.  This was obviously Jed&#39;s work but the question was, how? He had been downstairs the whole time she had been in the bath. Weirder still, her room was now filled with all sorts of items that looked like they came from a pet store - cages, a terrarium, chew toys and, most disturbingly, a collar with her name on it. How had this creep done it without her noticing? More to the point, what was she going to do about it. This man was clearly dangerous and had a dark fantasy of some sort involving her being his pet animal. <br />
Melanie needed to find her cellphone and get in touch with the authorities asap, but as she began searching around the room she quickly realised she couldn&#39;t find it. Had it been stolen along with all of her clothes? The whole thing was insane and she really had no idea what was going on or why Jed seemed so convinced she was a animal of some kind. But he certainly didn&#39;t seem to have any problems treating her like one. Right now she was beginning to feel like one as well, trapped naked in her room with only pet toys and treats for company. She could still feel Jed&#39;s presence right on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jed, if you let me get dressed and leave I promise I won&#39;t tell anyone about any of this&quot; Mel offered as calmly as she could. &quot;You&#39;ll never see me again, I&#39;ll get all of my stuff out and that&#39;ll be it&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed was listening at the door to her every move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just let me go, and I&#39;ll pretend this never happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed let out a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel&quot; he replied &quot;I think you&#39;ve misunderstood your situation&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie didn&#39;t respond, she didn&#39;t know what to say to him. He sounded completely deranged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel&quot; Jed continued &quot;I know you&#39;re frightened and you have no idea what is happening, but don&#39;t worry, everything is going to be just fine.&quot; He looked over the frog transformation spell again. &quot;Just a few changes, and then everything is going to be wonderful&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What changes? I&#39;m fine just the way I am!&quot; Melanie protested &quot;You have to let me leave, this is totally unacceptable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rather than answer, Jed began reciting the words of the transformation spell. Melanie could hear his words from the other side of the door but didn&#39;t recognise any of them. She was beginning to freak out. Not only did Jed seem to have complete confidence in what he was saying, but the words of his incantation actually began to feel like they were having an effect on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jed, stop! I don&#39;t like this, please, just stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
She moved as far back in the room as she could and crouched down behind the bed but there was no escaping the ethereal words of Jed&#39;s spell, which continued to fill the room and surround her. Melanie watched in disbelief as a green mist began to appear out of thin air. It seemed to move in rhythm with the words she was hearing, and was making its way towards her, taking a snake like form. The words Jed was reciting sounded so strange, so out of the ordinary but at the same time seemed to be sinking deep into Melanie&#39;s consciousness.She could no longer tell if it was her imagination but this was all starting to feel very real.<br />
<br />
Melanie quickly found she couldn&#39;t escape the spell&#39;s green mist, it was now slowly coiling around her entire naked body. She tried to fight the green smoke with her hands but it passed through them effortlessly and seemed to sink directly into her body. Melanie felt like the spell was a virus and it was infecting every part of her.<br />
<br />
She heard Jed&#39;s voice grow louder as he continued the incantation. She couldn&#39;t stop listening, she couldn&#39;t block out the words. It felt as though she didn&#39;t have the willpower to do anything anymore.  Melanie knew the words Jed was speaking were now becoming her reality. She felt the green smoke wrapping itself around her legs and felt the changes beginning.  The green smoke was turning her into an animal and Melanie knew it was already too late to fight.<br />
&quot;This is what happens to bad pets, Melanie&quot; Jed chided from the other side of the bedroom door as Melanie&#39;s feet began to turn bright green, &quot;you didn&#39;t listen to me, you didn&#39;t do what I said&quot;<br />
The tingling sensation in Melanie&#39;s feet was spreading further as her transformation began to intensify. Her legs were changing shape and her feet were growing wider as webbed toes appeared. Melanie gasped as she saw the changes in her skin and could feel her entire body being manipulated to become exactly what Jed wanted.  Jed continued to recite his spell with more conviction now as he neared the end. His words had such a powerful effect on Melanie and her body seemed to have no resistance to the enchantment. She couldn&#39;t bear the idea that the man on the other side of the door actually had the ability to transform her. He seemed so convinced that she would become a different species and Melanie now realised it was true, her body was now completely his to control.<br />
<br />
As Jed began reciting at a quicker pace Melanie could feel everything around her rapidly growing. The bed she had been crouching behind soon towered over her. The walls around her expanded in size, along with all of the furniture. The magic smoke was completely covering her now, sinking deeper into her body as her transformation accelerated. Her breasts began to shrink into her chest, her nipples were tightening as her flesh hardened, turning to smooth and bumpy skin. Melanie could not believe this was actually happening. She looked down in horror at her body and saw how unrecognisable to her it now was. Melanie shut her eyes and tried to block out what was happening as the smoke completely enveloped her. <br />
<br />
When she opened them the smoke had gone. She was now about eye level with Jed&#39;s giant shoe which she could see the the gap at the bottom of the door. He really had done it. The spell had worked. He had actually transformed her. <br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing in there Mel?&quot; Jed taunted &quot;Do you want to come out and play, frog?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melanie looked up at the door, wondering how it could have come to this. Just minutes ago she had been an ordinary woman living in the house with a roommate. Now she was an amphibian and that roommate was her captor. She didn&#39;t want to face Jed like this but she knew he wasn&#39;t going to let her stay hidden for long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can just stay there for the time being if you like, Mel, but don&#39;t think for a moment that you&#39;re going to stay in there for good, because I will come in and get you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed&#39;s voice was loud and commanding and Melanie knew he meant business. She hopped out into the corridor realising that antagonising Jed wasn&#39;t a good idea. Jed seemed thrilled at the sight of her post transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re adorable!&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t me&quot; Melanie croaked. &quot;You can&#39;t do this, Jed&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed&#39;s eyes widened with glee &quot;You&#39;re talking! That&#39;s wonderful!&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached down and scooped her up with one hand, cupping his palms to ensure she didn&#39;t fall or jump away. Melanie was so small that it was so easy for Jed to hold her captive in one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like the spell worked even better than I thought it would. You even seem to have some kind of human voice&quot; Jed boasted with delight, &quot;I hoped that might happen but I didn&#39;t actually think it was possible&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please turn me back and let me go&quot; Melanie&#39;s new croaky voice pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why exactly would I want to do that&quot; Jed cooed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed took great satisfaction from hearing his frog speak, her altered voice was perfect and he was getting an enormous thrill from controlling her and being able to transform her from one creature to the next. He wanted to hear her say it herself though.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should admit who you are&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Melanie Jones&quot; the frog croaked defiantly &quot;You know who I am&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are you, Melanie?&quot; <br />
<br />
Melanie had a feeling she knew what Jed wanted her to say and that it was better not to disappoint him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a frog&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, you are&quot; Jed said, his voice growing lower, his breathing heavy with lust and desire &quot;And who am I, Melanie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed&#39;s face had changed now. Gone was the mischievous smile, in its place a more serious and intense look. As much as she loathed having to play along with this, it seemed her only option for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Jed, my owner.&quot; Melanie croaked reluctantly.</p>
