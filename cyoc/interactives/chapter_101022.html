<br />
The next morning the Andersons woke in a mess of fur and sweat. They smile at each other over the bodies of their sleeping lovers. Evan and Maggie sprawled out in-between them, with the Twists curled into a ball on another side. <br />
<br />
“Well that went better than I expected.” Martha said with a smile. <br />
<br />
“Agreed. But we should probably get cleaned up. I don’t think Eric would appreciate us making his breakfast like this.” William gestured to his furry body, covered in dry cum and other fluids. <br />
<br />
“Allow me.” Martha said, sitting up and brushing some of the crust from her fur. Then proceeds to lick the “happy trail” on his stomach. William shudders, but does his best to contain himself. <br />
<br />
“As much as I’d love for you to finish what you’re doing, it’s past nine. And you’re forgetting, well have the entire house to ourselves tonight. Well, sort of.” William said, correcting himself as he remembered Eric would probably be home But he couldn’t hear as well as his brother, and that was a plus. It was still fairly awkward when they came upstairs, but William got the feeling that Eric wasn’t as uncomfortable as he had been in the beginning. <br />
<br />
Soon, the others begin to stir and wake. Maggie Lawson stretches out on the ground, her claws scrapping the cement floor. Evan leans over and attentively licks the dried spunk from her head. <br />
<br />
“Morning my beautiful pussy cat.” he said (pun intended).  <br />
<br />
“And to you my big bad wolf.” Maggie said.<br />
<br />
“Sorry if we woke you. I hope you weren’t planning on sleeping in. Well, sleeping in more.” Martha said, as she started changing back. <br />
<br />
Francis and Samantha woke soon after, and merely purred their morning greetings. They enjoyed each other’s company a bit longer while the others redressed themselves. <br />
<br />
“That’s fine. I’m due at the hospital this afternoon, so it’s a good thing I’m up now.” Maggie said. Martha nods, and tries to let her eyes linger on the shifting woman’s body. The day must go on, and it won’t if she gets turned on again. <br />
<br />
Evan and William are the first to finish dressing, seeing as all they really needed to do was put pants on. None of the women were unhappy to see them bare chested. Martha found herself gazing at Evan’s body more so than William’s. Partially because Evan was a more muscular (given his military training), but mostly because she’d been too busy to really look at it last night. That, and it was a lot different without all the fur. <br />
<br />
“See anything you like?” Evan asked playfully, noticing Martha’s staring. She blushes and mutters an apology. <br />
<br />
“No, it’s alright. I’m used to it.” Evan laughed. <br />
<br />
“Really? Do a lot of women catch you without a shirt?” Maggie teases.<br />
<br />
“Plenty of men, a few women. There isn’t much privacy on a destroyer.” Evan says. He’d spent about five years working on one of the Navy’s destroyers as a communications expert. During that period, there were sailors who knew about weres, and more than a few who didn’t. It made things interesting to say the least. <br />
<br />
“And you’re quite the sight for sore eyes.” Maggie added, wrapping her arms around her husband from behind. Which was almost impossible given Maggie’s small stature, and Evan’s not so small stature.  <br />
<br />
“I’m sure Spencer’s run off by now.” Maggie whispers into Evan’s ear. Spencer had no doubt left sometime during the night to spare herself an evening of listening to her parents have sex. Evan was a bit embarrassed about that himself, but not too embarrassed. Spencer gave him plenty of headaches, why not indulge in a little self abuse once in a while? <br />
<br />
“Where do you think the others ran off to?” Martha asked, thinking specifically of Eric, Ben and Alex. The latter two had slipped out sometime during dessert (the actual dessert). They weren’t really missed, though Maggie couldn’t deny she was intrigued by the possibility of bringing some youth into the mix. She’d accompanied Evan to his own pack meetings once in a while. And while she loved her fellow werecats, domestic or otherwise, werewolves certainly lived up to their reputations. <br />
<br />
“Ben and Alex probably went back to our place. I can’t imagine Alex’s parents allowing those two inside their house to… you know.” Francis said. <br />
<br />
“So everyone had a good night then,” Samantha says, kissing her wife. The two share another private moment before joining Maggie and Martha in the search for their underwear in the pile of discarded clothing. <br />
<br />
William and Evan go upstairs to air out the house, and start breakfast. The women clean themselves up as best they can without arousing each other. When they finally go upstairs, instead of smelling sex pheromones, they smell bacon and eggs. Which brings out other desires. <br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile… <br />
Ben and Alex, having finished their own “wild” night, wake and catch the scent of breakfast cooking next door. <br />
<br />
“Care to join them?” Alex asks, licking some of the sticky leftovers from his boyfriend’s chest. The two lay on the floor of Ben’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Why? We’ve got a good thing going on here.” Ben said.<br />
<br />
“Sure, sure. But, no offense, I’m kind of hungry. For something other than your little Boston Cream maker.”<br />
<br />
“Little? You think this is little?” Ben asked, lifting himself up so Alex can get a face full of his “little” cream maker. A bit of pre dribbles out and lands on Alex’s muzzle. He happily licks it up and then begins the process of sucking the rest of the cream from Ben’s doggie dick. <br />
<br />
“On second thought, we can go over later.” Alex says, pulling off for a moment. Then lowers himself back down and greedily keeps pulling until Ben releases another jet of cum into his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Breakfast is served.” Ben thinks, eager to have his turn on Alex’s cream maker. <br />
<br />
And now… <br />
Back in the Anderson house, the adults continue their breakfast. Dishes from last night are still in the sink, Maggie and Martha decide to tag-team them. Meanwhile, William and Evan finish cooking while Francis and Samantha set the breakfast table. <br />
<br />
“Worked up an appetite?” William asks, offering his wife a plate of food after she and Maggie finish washing the dishes. Strategically placed eggs, sausage and pancakes, Martha gets a devious smirk on her face. <br />
<br />
“Something else still on the brain?” Martha whispers into her husband’s ear. <br />
<br />
“A few things, but they can wait until later. Did you check on Eric?” <br />
<br />
“No, let him sleep in. I gather he had a pretty rough night. I’m not even sure when he came home.”<br />
<br />
Upstairs… <br />
Eric was fast asleep in bed, very much aware of the mess under his sheets. With some help from Spencer’s were form, he’d climbed through the window and back into his room. Walking in the front door was a definite no considering the sounds and smells coming from the living room. The last thing either of them wanted to do was walk in on their parents doing it. <br />
<br />
Spencer hadn’t bothered to mention the strong smells coming from the Twist house either. She guessed Ben and Alex excused themselves at some point so they could have their own private evening. <br />
<br />
Outside, up a tree, Spencer had fallen asleep to the sounds of her own pleasurable mews and that which was coming from the two houses. And those in the distance, which she suspected were coming from Nate and his panthress. <br />
<br />
She’d had no desire to leave last night after helping Eric sneak back into his bedroom. It took every bit of willpower to let him say goodbye, close the window, and walk away. Of course she had no way of knowing Eric too wanted her to stay, maybe even join him inside. The air was so filled with smells it was hard to tell which ones were coming from where. Some were from the adults in the basement, others from the two happy werewolves next door. But some of it was from Eric’s room, and that’s what Spencer found herself focusing on. <br />
<br />
“Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…” she muttered to herself in her sleep. That song always had the desired effect, even while half conscious. There was a growing puddle of juices on the forest floor that one might mistake for tree sap. Unless they looked up and saw the teenage were in the tree above purring in her sleep. And with one paw stuck in her black slit, the other vigorously clawing the tree bark.</p>
