<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“All right Nate,” the attending doctor giving the teen a quick examination; reading his chart. “It looks like you are stable enough to leave; however you know not to…”<br />
“I know,” Nate interrupting the doctor; “no shifting into my fursona. I was already told.”<br />
“I see,” the doctor narrowing his gaze onto Helen Tompkins; a fellow college who was currently under suspension for having sex with a patient. That patient being the were-lion sitting next to her and returning the icy stare.<br />
“Don’t try anything,” Helen commenting to the doctor; “Peter’s bite is just as nasty as his roar.”<br />
<br />
“But if you touch him in a certain spot,” Jean helping Nate up; “he mewls like a little kitten. And not in the pleasurable way,” Jean adding despite the withering stare she is getting from her older brother.<br />
“You might be able to get away with that sis,” Peter growling; “but don’t think you can get other’s to try.”<br />
“Wait until the pride meeting brother,” Jean smiling; “I can’t wait until you explain your new relationship status with all the single were-lioness’s after you.”<br />
<br />
Peter just glares as Jean and Peter slowly leave the hospital room. Glad that her sister and mate are finally gone, Peter gets up to stare at the doctor.<br />
“Now how soon will I get to leave,” Peter glaring.<br />
“Once tests are run,” the doctor responds; “and x-rays are taken, I don’t see why you can’t leave this evening.”<br />
“Good,” Peter grumbling; “a chance to stroll in the woods tonight will do me some good.”<br />
“I’m not so sure about that,” Helen shaking her head; “there are reports all over town. Someone told the press regarding Frederick Parker’s arrest. The were-alert has naturally been extended.”<br />
“Great,” Peter growling as he slams his paw onto a nearby table; “I so enjoy hiding under blankets in the back seat of a car.”<br />
“Sarcasm aside,” the doctor shaking his head; “your discharge is tantamount to you finally expelling all those bone chips through your urethra.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“I better let my parents know,” Nate being wheeled out of the hospital via a wheelchair; “that I’m being discharged.”<br />
“You can tell them when we get back to my place,” Jean wheeling her mate out of the hospital; “I doubt you will be required to head to school today.”<br />
“But tomorrow,” Nate sighing; “and I hope you aren’t planning something kinky. As much as I like a good rut,” Nate seeing the hospital entrance doors in sight; “I’m not allowed to shift for at least a week.”<br />
“That doesn’t mean,” Jean snickering; “that we can’t have fun not in our fursonas.”<br />
 <br />
Nate perked up a little upon hearing what Jean mentioned; yet he felt slightly disappointed. Ever since becoming a werewolf; Nate has found sex while in his fursona so much more enjoyable with his partner. The feel of his knot swelling and locking him in the tunnel of the willing female; the primal urge to howl triumphantly as he spilled forth his load. After enjoying that sensation, sex while in his human form felt lacking.<br />
“I hope you’re not planning to ride me,” Nate getting out of the wheelchair; “despite wanting to take you as soon as we go someplace private, I’m not feeling up to it. If you know what I mean,” Nate taking a few steps gingerly while holding on to a walking cane to steady himself.<br />
“Oh you’ll be in the mood,” Jean chuckling; “I am quiet skilled in…oral pleasure.”<br />
“On that I have allusions over,” Nate eliciting a wry smile; “but I feel we should hold off on such fun. Trying to hold back shifting while you know… coming,” Nate chuckling softly; “it’s not something I’ve bothered to master.”<br />
“Oh,” Jean looking at her mate; “what about you know, going solo?”<br />
“I’m not dignifying that with an answer,” Nate looking at Jean as they reached her Shelby cobra; “suffice to say, after becoming a werewolf, I have not had the need to do that.”<br />
“Well that blows, Jean unable to stifle a giggle; “I’m sure we can find something to do for the day then.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Sitting in the faculty lounge; under the same spot that had the major roof leak from last December’s rain storm, Martha sighed as she munched on the sandwich and chip combo she grabbed from the sandwich shop on her way to the first day of school. Looking up to see the ceiling looking pristine; the ceiling and roof patched, one wouldn’t have known that the elementary school was in bad shape.<br />
“Try all you might,” a fellow teacher speaking; “you won’t find a crack in the plaster. Those contractor’s did too good of a job.”<br />
“Oh,” Martha shifting her gaze to the person speaking; “I wasn’t trying to look for that.”<br />
“It’s hard not to,” the other teacher speaking; “your sitting under the spot that had the leak.”<br />
“Really,” Martha looking back up before sitting in another spot; “I didn’t realize. I’ve been having one of those mornings.”<br />
“Tell me about it,” the other teacher sitting down; “teaching first grade to a bunch of were-children… It takes it’s toll on you. I have one student,” the teacher sighing; “so full of energy and bouncing off the walls, I’ve already had to call his parents to discuss certain things.” The teacher exhaling a breath before continuing; “things he is saying that can risk our exposure.”<br />
“My oldest son,” Martha speaking flatly; “was attacked last night. He is currently in the hospital. My youngest son,” Martha sighing; “got surprised today by being told he was being placed into senior year of high school. Plus taking extra college level courses,” Martha answering; “William and I were supposed to tell him during summer break yet, we got side tracked.”<br />
<br />
“How did you get side tracked,” the teacher asking; yet knowing full well of the answer.<br />
“Let’s just say,” Martha looking bemused; “that since Eric became a were-panther, he has come out of his shell in more ways than one. And William and I have discovered a place that allows us to enjoy the swinging lifestyle with zeal.”<br />
“And you and your husband are were-foxes,” the teacher looking curious.<br />
“We moved to Moon Lake last year,” Martha answering; “our oldest Nate became a werewolf first. William and I became were-foxes shortly after. Eric didn’t become a were-panther until last December.”<br />
<br />
The chat continued on for the duration of the lunch period. Martha finding out that the teacher was a were-dog by the name of Bruce and a widow. The student that the teacher needed to have a sit down with his parents was none other than Darrell Cooper, who was attending school for the first time.<br />
“You have any children,” Martha asking.<br />
“A son,” Bruce answering; “he is a freshman this year at Moon Lake High. He has yet to experience his first transformation,” Bruce sounding nervous; “his fourteenth birthday is a few weeks away and he is already starting to have those dreams.”<br />
“Dreams,” Martha looking confused; “what kind of dreams?”<br />
“Dreams a naturally born were will have,” Bruce answering; “signaling that their first transformation is approaching. To put it in quick words,” Bruce looking at the time and seeing that lunch period is nearly over; “a were’s animal half wakes up upon onset of puberty, which begins at fourteen for us. I’m sure it was touched upon in the town’s pamphlet you must have been given when you moved here.”<br />
“I can’t recall per say,” Martha finishing up her lunch; “Eric is the one with the eidetic memory, so he would know. What I do know,” Martha getting up; “I’m not relishing the chat with him after school. I think he will be upset over being put in advance classes.”</p>
