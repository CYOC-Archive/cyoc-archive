<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, you&#39;re here!&quot; Diego shouted, waking up. Eduardo sat up and rubbed his eyes. &quot;What time is it?&quot; he asked, yawning. Diego smiled. &quot;It&#39;s 7:30.&quot; Eduardo nodded and got dressed, heading into the kitchen to get himself something to eat. He grabbed a bagel and cheese from the fridge and headed upstairs to his room. His door open showing his sexy boyfriend laying in bed naked. &quot;Wow&quot;, he said, staring at his abs, &quot;you&#39;re like a fitness model.&quot; Eduardo said, realizing that although he had memories of being a 23 year old marine he also had memories of being his former self. Diego laughed and said &quot;Mira todo esto&quot;, waving his hand at his body, &quot;y tu?&quot; He asked in his thick Mexican accent. &quot;Ready for round two?&quot;, he said, &quot;Me gusta el estar desnudo&quot;, he began to get excited, &quot;gratis!&quot; He jumped up and wrapped his muscular arms around his boyfriend. &quot;Te amo&quot;, he said, kissing him on the lips. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re so cute&quot;, Eduardo said, kissing him back, &quot;but I&#39;m still hungry. Want to grab something to eat after round two?&quot;<br />
&quot;Tiburon Steakhouse, top of the line&quot;, he said, &quot;I know a guy who owes me a favor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, sounds good&quot;, he said.<br />
<br />
The two began their morning routine, kissing, caressing, and having passionate, if awkward, make-out sessions. They were a perfect match, and if they didn&#39;t make love when they did, they&#39;d end up spending the rest of the day indulging in each others&#39; bodies.<br />
Eduardo once again was interested in the strange device called Chronivac. He saw Diego described on the screen perfectly. He also saw the options to change Diego. Feeling mischievous he chose to make him gain weight, then decided to make him gain even more. He watched as his body gawked at him in the mirror, then laughed at how it looked.<br />
&quot;How did you like it?&quot; He asked. &quot;Gained like 20 pounds&quot;, he said, shocked, then laughed when he looked at his reflection again. Eduardo saw the option for &quot;Oso&quot; he laughed thinking of seeing Diego even more fat and hairy. He decided to use the Chronivac to make Diego fatter and hairy.<br />
As he watched, his reflection grew fatter and hairier, before the screen went black.<br />
&quot;Shit....&quot; He said, he accidentally turned himself into a fat hair gay latino bear of a man. His body grew and bulged, with fat and hair. He still looked sexy but he was no longer as fit as before. New memories began to appear as he remembered leaving the marines with Diego, stopped working out and became fat. Diego on the other hand only had gained 20 pounds since leaving the marines and still looked good. &quot;But of course he still looks good&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so funny&quot;, he said, &quot;look at the both of us, look at me I&#39;m a bear now.&quot; Eduardo said. &quot;I don&#39;t even think we were fat when we were in the marines. We were probably average.&quot; It was true Eduardo had let himself go, but he now remembered always having a gut, and being larger and struggling to keep his weight, all day he felt a little self conscious about it but also liking his new look, but next to Deigo he felt odd, if only Diego also let himself go. The rest of the day was uneventful, other than Deigo cruising on grindr which made Eduardo feel jealous that their open relationship seemed to only be enjoyed by Deigo who had larger range of guys interested in him <br />
<br />
Early that afternoon Eduardo said to Deigo &quot;Do you think I looked average when we were in the marines?&quot; He looked up and down his boyfriend &quot;Well, you&#39;re not average now, papi&quot; Diego said, giving him a playful punch, &quot;let&#39;s go eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair laughed and headed to Tiburon, which was a rather long drive. When they pulled up, it looked as fancy as the upscale restaurants in the city. The host seated them in a quiet corner and brought them some drinks.<br />
After some time had passed, they had finished their meals and ordered dessert. &quot;So Dios Mio&quot; Diego said, tapping on his chest, &quot;what do you think of all this?<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so full I don&#39;t even want dessert&quot; Eduardo laughed, &quot;but seriously, I feel like I&#39;ve been eating too much fast food. My belly isn&#39;t as smooth as it once was.&quot;<br />
&quot;Amen&quot;, Diego said, raising his hands up, &quot;I don&#39;t know how I got so lucky to have found you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m happy you did&quot;, Eduardo said, smiling. He looked at his watch and said, &quot;I guess we better get back, it&#39;s getting late.&quot; He also noticed the Chronivac app on his phone. He could change Diego now if he wanted too. He could make his skin really pale or add a bunch of tattoos.<br />
&quot;Man, I could really change you. Like, we could go so far that you wouldn&#39;t be the same. I could add tattoos or something.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay, babe. I don&#39;t need no facial hair or tattoos. I&#39;ll always be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eduardo laughed, &quot;Well, whatever you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
As they were about to get up, their waiter arrived with the bill. He handed it to Diego, who looked at it and then at Eduardo, &quot;Hey, this is pretty expensive. Do you have this tips?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, we do get big bucks to do this&quot; he said, &quot;but if we did, I&#39;d say you were worth it.&quot;<br />
Diego smiled, blushed and thanked him. They left the expensive restaurant and headed back to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot;, he said, &quot;I guess we better go home now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay&quot;, Eduardo said.<br />
<br />
The pair pulled out of the parking lot and soon, they were back on the road. It was silent for a while, before Diego broke it, &quot;So, what changes are you going to put in me?&quot;<br />
Eduardo laughed, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;I dunno&quot;, he said, &quot;I&#39;m just so excited for you to turn me into something new and different, I feel like you must be thinking of something. Tell me, what are you thinking of?&quot;<br />
Eduardo thought for a moment, &quot;I was thinking maybe you could be more fat and hairy like me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well&quot;, he laughed, &quot;that&#39;s not a bad idea. I&#39;ll definitely consider it.&quot;<br />
They continued to laugh as they pulled into Eduardo&#39;s fathers apartment complex. &quot;Seriously though lets make you a sexy bear.&quot; Before Diego could protest Eduardo had already used the Chronivac app to change Diego into a sexy latino gay bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now&quot;, he said, &quot;we have to go do something&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on&quot;, said Diego, &quot;did you just use the Chronivac on me? Are you going to change me back?&quot;<br />
Eduardo just laughed and got out of the car, looking back at Diego who was twice the size before, filled with muscle fat, large arms and bulging belly. He said &quot;C&#39;mon, lets have some fun in bed again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair entered the apartment and were met by Eduardo&#39;s father. He was a heavy set man, always wrapped up in blankets. His face was haggard and his eyes bloodshot. He looked at them both and said &quot;well, if it isn&#39;t the gay bears&quot;.<br />
&quot;Hello sir&quot;, said Eduardo, &quot;We are just headed up to my room&quot; The two large former marines walked hand in hand to their room. Eduardo was ready to enjoy his big burly boyfriend.</p>
