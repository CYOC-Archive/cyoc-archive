<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John decided to pick Bella, and then Mark would check on the two later after everything got started. Walking up to her station John said &quot;Hi I&#39;m Jane, I just transferred in.&quot; <br />
Bella said &quot;Yo, I&#39;m Bella but my friends call me Bel. I had prepared some fish the other day and just need to make some batter to deep fry it.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Just same batter? That should be simple.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s how fried smelt turned into odd savory pancakes...&quot; John explained to Bella and her friend Zoe. <br />
&quot;So why&#39;d you invite her along to my house?&quot; Zoe asked <br />
Bella said &quot;Well it wasn&#39;t like the deep fried fish pancakes were bad exactly... We got along and I kinda just thought it would be ok if offered to let her join us. Also she&#39;s one of the Priestesses... Of Chronos right? I thought it may be fun to have her around. Maybe make some Jello in record time or something.&quot; <br />
Zoe the short shrimp asked semi-jokingly &quot;So could you make me into a mature woman?&quot;<br />
John explained &quot;I can&#39;t influence your growth directly, but I can make you older and we can see how you&#39;ll look in the future.&quot;  Zoe thought for a second. She really wanted to be taller, and have a nice figure. It was a little frustrating being so small so long, but if she&#39;d remain small for the rest of her life... <br />
Zoe apprehensively said &quot;Yes, I&#39;d like to see what I&#39;m like when I&#39;m older.&quot; <br />
Bella asked &quot;Going straight into human experimentation?&quot; <br />
Zoe said &quot;Hey it&#39;s my body and I want to see how big I get!&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I&#39;ve done similar things before. Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not dangerous and I can always turn her back. Now sit back and watch a time manipulator do her work.&quot; and let her magic go out and influence Zoe&#39;s body. The two young women watched their little friend sprout up as she grew little less than an entire foot. While not tall she wasn&#39;t short. More than that was her curves were coming in as her petite breasts were ballooning out in front of her, as the girl&#39;s uniform and underwear were switching to her future outfits to match her body. Bella had seen John keep a coin in the air for awhile, but that could&#39;ve just been a trick... This was magic. <br />
Zoe who had her eyes closed until the odd feeling ended opened her eyes and asked &quot;...This is my body?&quot; In a deeper voice. Looking down she was greeted by a large pair of breasts taking up a decent amount of her field of view. with some of her now long hair covering them. &quot;I&#39;m tall, my hair is so long... and these breasts!&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Well you&#39;ve aged well.&quot; <br />
Zoe asked &quot;So how much older am I anyways?&quot; checking out her backside and trying to see her legs under her breasts. John was taking a little while to answer and clearly was thinking about it which made Zoey uneasy and say &quot;I mean if this is what I&#39;m like in my forties or something then I&#39;ve aged really well bu-&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh no, It&#39;s for sure not that far... I&#39;m just not sure exactly how far I&#39;ve aged you, but I know how much power I&#39;ve used.&quot; John said, &quot;In fact... I could just stop aging you the same amount of time I just aged you.&quot; <br />
Zoe said &quot;So... we could just play this off as a growth spurt, and I wouldn&#39;t get wrinkles or anything in my early twenties?&quot; <br />
John thought and said &quot;Sure? It would be like rewinding someone, but let the magic rewind one second per second... and done&quot; <br />
Zoe asked &quot;But I didn&#39;t feel anything.&quot; <br />
Bella said &quot;Yeah... nothing happened.&quot; <br />
&quot;Hey, just cause it&#39;s magic doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s always flashy.&quot; John said, &quot;So you want to keep that form? You&#39;d need to get new clothes and a Uniform.&quot;<br />
Zoe thought and said &quot;Yeah, there&#39;s no way my old stuff could fit on this body... but I&#39;d be getting new clothes anyways at some point... I do have some money saved up... Hey Bel wanna swing by the Outlets fast?&quot;<br />
Bella sighed and said &quot;Sure...&quot; and then Bella left to get changed out of her school uniform while Zoe left to get her purse. John thought it would probably a good idea to change herself... Well without a change time to try out that time manipulation cloth changing thing. It had been a side effect of aging or regressing someone that their clothes would change to something they wore in the past or future... but what if... as John started her little clothing morphing the front door of Zoe&#39;s apartment opened. It was her older brother Chad back from his after school activities, and the tall lean hunk of an athlete was still in his uniform and sweaty... John lost concentration at a bad time when she had put herself to a point in time when she was in the shower and her clothing happened to be a bunch of water droplets mostly leaving her wet and nude in front of the guy. <br />
Chad said &quot;Ah, feel great to finally be home... and who are you?&quot; really confused right now... Was she some Stalker? Maybe Zoe had a friend who needed to take a shower an- The wet naked girl&#39;s form seemed to ripple as the water turned into clothing. So... she&#39;s some sort of Priestess? <br />
John was blushing and said &quot;Umm... Hello...&quot; while internally thinking &quot;Shoot! Why did I stop there?!? Should&#39;ve known he would&#39;ve came here at some point anyways... Him and his muscles being shown off and his sweat drenched... The hell am I thinking? Why am I looking at him like some horny girl?!? I&#39;m-&quot; <br />
Chad asked &quot;So your that Priestess Jane everyone&#39;s been talking about? How about we say... I didn&#39;t see anything?&quot; <br />
John started calming herself down and said &quot;Yeah, that&#39;d probably be for the best.&quot; <br />
Chad asked &quot;So what, you and Zoe became friends?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Sorta, Accidentally ruined some of Bella&#39;s fish. Interacted and got invited along.&quot; <br />
Chad chuckled and said &quot;You know my face&#39;s up here?&quot; <br />
John smirked and said &quot;Like your eye&#39;s haven&#39;t gone to my chest once or twice.&quot; <br />
Chad&#39;s face got a little more stoic as he said &quot;Hey, I&#39;m a gentleman. I respect boundaries and wouldn&#39;t just stare at a woman.&quot; Zoe came out from her room and snuck behind her brother. <br />
She asked &quot;Guess who, oh dear brother of mine?&quot; with her deeper voice. At which point Chad turned around and stared at his sister... dumbfounded. <br />
John asked &quot;so what was that about staring? That&#39;s Zoe Chad.&quot; <br />
Chad asked &quot;Ok, what&#39;s going on?!? Did you put some curse on-&quot; <br />
Zoe barked out &quot;Chad! I asked for this! After getting some new clothes this is a 100% upside!&quot; <br />
&quot;Are you sure? Any side eff-&quot; <br />
John explained &quot;Nope, it&#39;s god magic. Although due to a little ingenuity she wont be aging for a couple of years... to make up for how much she&#39;s just aged.&quot;<br />
Zoe asked &quot;So how did you become a priestess anyways?&quot;<br />
John said &quot;Well I was approached by Chronos. No idea about any of the other priestesses though.&quot; Zoe hatched an idea and as she was waiting for Bella closed her eyes in prayer. <br />
Chad asked &quot;Zoe, what are you trying to do?&quot; <br />
Zoe said &quot;Sh... praying...&quot; <br />
Chad asked John &quot;What are the odds this actually works?&quot; <br />
John shrugged and said &quot;No idea. Not sure who&#39;d even be listening.&quot; That was the real question. Was anyone listening, and if any god accepted than who?</p>
