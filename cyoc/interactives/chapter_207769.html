<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Across the bed, Nathan uttered a similar noise and Jodie knew that he&#39;d felt the same sharp prick she had. Staring down at the shirt and red dog collar, waiting, she eventually looked over at the her fiancé and asked, &quot;Anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shake of head, Nathan responded, &quot;Not a thing, unless you want to count what felt like a static shock. You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; Jodi said and starting to sniff the air, it suddenly came to her that there was the most rich, tantalising aroma in the room she&#39;d ever smelt before. Continuing to stare at her fiancé, who was picking up the black dog collar and shirt, it suddenly came to her that what she was smelling was Nathan, and that it was turning her on.<br />
<br />
Disappointed that it hadn&#39;t worked, oblivious to what Jodie was doing as she sniffed the air, and the fact that he also could smell the same odour as the woman, Nathan deposited the two items on a nearby chair. Hands slipping around his waist as he did so, he smiled as he realised that his fiancé had snuck up behind him. Looking over his shoulder, he smiled and whispered, &quot;I guess it didn&#39;t work, did it?&quot; as it came to him how great Jodie smelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; the woman said. &quot;It might not have transformed us, but maybe it did do something,&quot; and pushing herself up on tiptoes, she kissed his chin, then told him, &quot;You smell great. So much so, it&#39;s turning me on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her scent driving him near wild, Nathan turned around and returned the kiss. Each eliciting a soft growl, they moved toward the bed, with Jodie walking backward as the man led her. Laying her down, he cupped one of her breasts through her shirt and leaned down to kiss her mouth. Returning the kiss, Jodie arched her back to force her breast into his hand. Wanting him, to feel his hand cupped over her bare breasts, she whimpered and scooted away. Giving her a soft whimper in response, Nathan cocked his head and watched her as she sat up, grasped the hem of her shirt, pulled it up over her head, and then removed her bra.<br />
<br />
Bare breasts exposed, nipples hard, erect, she edged closer to him, noting as she did the aroma she&#39;d smelled earlier was stronger. Not caring, she took one of his hands and after kissing each finger tip, the palm, she pressed it against her chest. Needing no other invitation, her fiancé used his free hand to take off his shirt, then his belt, before he cupped her other breast and lay down a top of her. Kissing each other, uttering yips, whimpers, soft growls, they soon stopped and took to rubbing against each, sniffing, before with a series of canine noises that each missed, they pushed away from each other. Sniffing at each other, they circled on the bed until Nathan stepped back and off. Jodie matching his movements, they each gave the other a hungry, bestial look as he kicked off his boots, she her shoes. Shucking off their pants, underwear and socks, they leapt back on the bed, causing the few items still on it to fly off.<br />
<br />
Howls of rapture escaped the naked couple and Nathan play bowed. Jodie rubbed her head against his and they each whimpered and made a series of other dog noises. Their sexual excitement and arousal growing, they circled, batted, and pushed up against each other, sometimes even pushing themselves up so that they were kneeling on the bed, at which point they&#39;d use their hands to touch and fondle other as they alternated between licking and kissing the other. For how long they kept this up, neither knew. All either knew was that it was a level of foreplay that they&#39;d never knew existed and that the longer it went, the more aroused they grew until, with a series of yips, Nathan turned and presented himself to Jodie.<br />
<br />
For a split second, he wondered, &quot;What the hell am I doing,&quot; even as his fiancé asked herself the same thing. But then Jodie smelled his scent and the moment passed as she leapt atop him.<br />
<br />
Arms wrapped tight his waist, she threw back her head and bared her teeth as she rubbed against him. An ache unlike any she&#39;d thought possible settled in her abdomen and feeling it growing, she continued to rub against Nathan, missing as her clitoris, clitoris hood and urethra merged together. Beneath her, Nathan shifted in place and whimpered, first in confusion, then in pleasure as within his groin, and the area betwixt his legs, he felt a warmth, and electric surge, unlike anything he&#39;d ever felt. Wanting Jodie to take him, mount him, he whimpered again as within him, a slight discomfort blossomed whilst his nuts and nut sack pulled tight against his body.<br />
<br />
Lost in the throes of passion, each was oblivious to their first change. As Jodie&#39;s exterior genitals merged, and a thin shaft that was quickly growing pushed outward, the ache within her settled lower and lower until with a pop that seemed to send her horniness through the roof what was once her vulva fused to form a scrotum and two canine testicles dropped into them. As a sheath formed, beneath her, her fiancé&#39;s body also continued to change as his testicles became ovaries, which were promptly drawn up into his body. And as the internal reproductive organs developed, his ovaries settled into their rightful play and began to pump out female hormones and ovum.<br />
<br />
Close to the point she&#39;d begin to howl, and near the point when she&#39;d release her sperm, Jodie kept rubbing and thrusting at Nathan. A combination of the magick and her own body waiting for the right moment, it was sensed the instant Nathan&#39;s canine vulva finished forming and he went completely into heat. Smelling this, Jodie lost all sense of control and biology took over as with one final rub that made the area slick, she thrust her neo-penis into Nathan&#39;s waiting neo-vagina. Her knot swelling, tying her to him, she gripped him tighter as she began to thrust harder, faster until she felt herself release in such a way it caused her to yelp in delight as below her a dog-like grin appeared on Nathan and he climaxed in a way he never thought possible, causing him to bark in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Slowly, the two came down off the euphoria they felt, though Jodie still gripped her fiancé tight, knotted to him, giving a thrust every so often. A moan from below her and she gasped out, &quot;That felt great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan wanted to agree, but his thoughts clearing, it suddenly came to him that he was down on all fours and that Jodie was atop him. Realising why she was, he tried to sort out when and why she&#39;d put on a strap-on, but the idea was driven from when it came to him that it had been forced into his anus. Thinking, &quot;Oh, shit. What the hell did we do. I don&#39;t even like that sort of thing,&quot; all other thoughts were driven from him when with an abruptness that was like being dunked in freezing water, he understood that it wasn&#39;t his ass Jodie had plunged into. Starting to panic, he tried to pull away, but found himself stuck as from behind him his fiancé yelped in a mix of pain and surprise. Telling her, &quot;Take it out, take it out, take it,&quot; he again tried to pull away and feeling her pulled along, he yelped, &quot;Oh, shit, oh, god, oh, crap. What the hell. Why do I feel, that, inside me,&quot; as Jodie gripped tighter in an effort to get him to stop moving.<br />
<br />
Frightened by what was happening, and the sudden realisation of what she&#39;d done and what she now had, Jodie barked out, &quot;Stop moving, you silly bitch,&quot; to which the immediate response was, &quot;Get it out, get it out, get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would if I could,&quot; Jodie growled and shifting about, she soon found herself facing the other way, still tied to Nathan. Looking back at him, wanting to ask how he got it so that his penis wasn&#39;t so hard, she yelped in pain when he tried to pull away again as well as shock as she watched both her tailbone and his start to extend outward. Growing more and more scared, she pushed backward when Nathan tried to pull away again, and in the process forcing her fiancé to stop, as well as shove him so that he fell face first into the pillows. Yelping out, &quot;This was a bad idea,&quot; she then whimpered, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to be a dog. I don&#39;t want to be a dog,&quot; and tearing her eyes away from the developing tails, she focused on Nathan as best as she could as she asked, &quot;What are we going to do?” to which her fiancé didn’t respond.</p>
