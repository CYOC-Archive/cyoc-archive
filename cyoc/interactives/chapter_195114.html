<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle had no time to hide the bulge of his now massive endowment, so chose the next best option of using his newfound powers. With only a few seconds to think, Kyle said the first thing that came to mind. &quot;I want this to be normal.&quot; Damnit! Why had he said that? He meant that he wanted to be normal, not for &#120373;&#120361;&#120362;&#120372; to be normal. How would his powers even interpret that wish? No time to fix it however, as his Mom enters the room.<br />
&quot;Did you say something honey?&quot; She asks as she opens the door and looks in. After seeing Kyle, she looks down and immediately notices his massive bulge of his schlong on his pant leg, as would most people. Her reaction however is not one of shock, horror, or embarrassment, but simply one of mild surprise. &quot;Oh honey, I didn&#39;t realize that it was that time of day for you. I was just coming up to tell you that I made us some brunch. I&#39;ll leave you alone now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes honey?&quot; she said, looking him in the eyes. Unable to think of a natural way to push the topic of his dick being visible without sounding weird, Kyle simply avoided the elephant in the room.<br />
&quot;What did you make?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pancakes and bacon. Come downstairs when you&#39;re done.&quot; She then left the room. Kyle simply did not know what to say. Everything about that interaction felt entirely alien, but very normal at the same time. Like it was a conversation that could have happened about anything, and had nothing to do with his massive equipment simply being visible. Was his mom oblivious? No she had noticed, she just didn&#39;t care. The wish to make this normal had somehow made it perfectly normal for his mom to just catch him with his dick visible, and cum on his pants, like it happens all the time. Is it just his mom that reacts like that, or would other people he knows also react nonchalantly. Maybe his mistake made everyone think it was completely normal for him to have his dick bulge visible. Maybe anybody could have their dick bulging and it would be treated as normal? No, Kyle recalled that his mom had specifically said &quot;I didn&#39;t realize it was that time of day FOR YOU...&quot; That must mean that it&#39;s only a him thing. Kyle was curious how others would react. Would people that he doesn&#39;t even know react the same way, or would they react how they would normally. Questions for later. For now Kyle had a warm brunch with his name on it. Kyle did his best to get his newly enlarged penis comfortable in his pants, and walked out into the dining room, with an obvious snake down his leg.<br />
When Kyle got to the table, his mom sat down, and they began eating together. Kyle hoped to approach the subject carefully, but subtlety wasn&#39;t particularly on his mind. <br />
&quot;Hey mom, why is it normal for me to do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do what sweetie?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, what you saw me doing upstairs just now.&quot; Kyle said, getting straight to the point.<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean masturbating? Most boys do it Kyle, it&#39;s completely normal. I thought you would have learned that in school by now.&quot; She said, even less subtle than Kyle.<br />
&quot;No, I have. I mean why is it okay for me to do it in front of you?&quot; Kyle asked, trying to get some answers on how his powers worked this.<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t doing it in front of me Kyle, I saw you after you finished.&quot; She said, still oblivious to how weird this all is. Before this, they would never be this open about his masturbation habits.<br />
&quot;Yes, but you still saw it, and you acted like it was normal.&quot; Kyle said, beginning to get slightly annoyed that he hadn&#39;t quite gotten answers yet.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t act Kyle, it is normal. You masturbate so often, it&#39;s become quite typical to see you in that situation. It stopped being strange a long time ago, for everyone.&quot; She said, very matter of factly.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t masturbate that often. Wait, normal for everyone? What do you mean everyone?&quot; Kyle questioned, very interested in her wording.<br />
&quot;You do masturbate often Kyle. You do it several times a day. Almost hourly in fact, I don&#39;t know how you don&#39;t recognize that. And when I say everyone Kyle, of course I just mean everyone you know, don&#39;t be a smart ass with me. You used to get in trouble for doing it at school and at your friends houses, don&#39;t you remember that? You&#39;ve even been caught doing it at restaurants a few times. It&#39;s a wonder you&#39;re still a virgin actually.&quot; His mom said, in a very expository manner. It became clear to Kyle at this point that this was certainly not a one time occurrence, and that this happened pretty regularly. It seemed almost impossible to him that somebody could masturbate that many times a day without suffering some kind of ill effects. He wondered if whatever condition he must have has strained his social life in any meaningful way, or if somehow everything has remained the same. The ramifications of simply making this normal might be much larger than he had anticipated. Kyle simply assumed that he must have some kind of condition to justify this behavior. He decided that his mom would likely know that too.<br />
&quot;What does the condition I have actually do Mom?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know the exact medical science behind it, but basically...&quot;</p>
