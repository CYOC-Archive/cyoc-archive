As Jeff was looking through the rack, trying to find a unique costume for the party, he stumbled across the same old things. Wizard, Monk, Dr., boring! What&#39;s more, he would love something that he and his friend could go together as. Perhaps matching outfits, or even one of those funky horse or cow costumes. Jeff then happened upon a great find – a sumo wrestler costume – for 2! It had a black yarn bun of hair, face mask, and even a loincloth sewn on the crotch! The label read, &quot;must be worn by two people in order to mass out the costume right. Team up with a friend and have a close bonding experience.&quot; That sounds interesting.<br />
Jeff purchased the costume, signing a funky waiver he didn&#39;t quite understand. Something about the costume would be a lasting bonding experience and had lasting effects. He only thought that that meant on people&#39;s party memories...<br />
When Jeff got home, he was dying to try the costume on. We tried it on by himself, and the label was right: he just didn&#39;t operate it right. It was so large  around in the middle, that it had to have a second person operating the back half of the costume.<br />
So Jeff waited for his friend Matt to get home after work. They would just have to get dressed on the way to the party, as he didn&#39;t think he could drive with him together in the same costume. That would be a bit of a stretch…<br />
Matt was not as quite as excited as Jeff was. &quot;You want me to do what? Fill out the back half of a human costume? I would understand if it was a horse…&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on, Matt – give it a try.&quot;<br />
&quot;OK; but only with my fall clothes on. I don&#39;t want to be that close to you...&quot;<br />
Outside behind the party house, Matt and Jeff try to get into the sumo costume.<br />
The costume just didn&#39;t fit right. It was incredibly hot with clothes on underneath, and the costume fabric bunched up in odd spots; ruining the illusion. The interior bungee straps- meant to grip to skin to mass out the costume right- just didn&#39;t ride well on their clothing.<br />
&quot;We gotta try something different; this isn&#39;t working&quot; said Jeff. &quot;And- we don&#39;t have time to get other costumes.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind&quot; moaned Matt.<br />
&quot;To reduce the heat, but strip down to underwear, and see also if the costume rides better.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so Jeff&quot; said Matt. &quot;What did you say was on the line again?<br />
&quot;$500 cash prize!&quot; says Jeff.<br />
&quot;Damn – that would go along way towards a new bike. Fine – I&#39;ll do it, but only until judging is done competition is done.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot; said Jeff.<br />
They stripped down to their underwear- Matt to his boxers and Jeff to his briefs-and stepped into the suit. Jeff took the front half, and Matt took the back half. They each stepped into the legs, and zipped up the sides along each of their thighs. Each sumo foot had a footboard that they both strapped on like sandals. From the waist up, the zipper was on the inside of the suit, allowing them to zip themselves inside the tent-like costume. Jeff positioned his face in the front mask and the front half of the arms, while Matt worked to finish zipping up the inside enclosure. Matt then strapped themselves together so that their arms chest and legs could move in unison. The net result was a satisfyingly lumbering sumo wrestler.<br />
<br />
 &quot;We may actually win this award&quot; said Matt. &quot;Jeff – I&#39;ve got to hand it to you – this is pretty cool. And – without our clothes, it&#39;s actually kind of bearable in here. I don&#39;t actually mind being this close to you&quot; said Matt.<br />
&quot;I was hoping you&#39;d say that...&quot; Mused Jeff. &quot;I don&#39;t actually mind you rubbing up against my butt.&quot;<br />
&#39;Wait a minute-&#39;, thought Jeff. &#39;That&#39;s not a thought I&#39;d normally say...&#39;<br />
&quot;Well- I can do more than rub... How about a little pressure from behind?!&quot;<br />
That&#39;s something that MATT wouldn&#39;t normally say. But for some reason, Jeff was into it. <br />
Matt rubbed his hardening dick back and forth across Jeff&#39;s butt. They had definitely stopped walking to the party; now the sumo wrestler appeared to be doing the cha cha in place in a dark corner.<br />
Because of his position and the straps, Jeff couldn&#39;t return any favors just yet. But at the moment, he didn&#39;t care.<br />
Matt slipped a hand out of the arm holster and pulled Jeff&#39;s briefs down. Matt had already tented his boxers and was poking out of the button fly.<br />
&quot;Matt- what are you doing... Ahhhh... This isn&#39;t like us...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know; but I don&#39;t care. I want in you so badly! I don&#39;t know why!&quot;<br />
Matt stuck his dick between Jeff&#39;s cheeks and started rubbing again. The heat started to build in both of them. Jeff slid up and down Matts shaft, getting something out of it as well. Matt reached around with his free hand and started pumping Jeff&#39;s hardening cock. Matt could imagine that he could feel his hand on his own cock. But- the haze of ecstasy made him not really figure out how that could be. Finally- Matt blew his load between Jeff&#39;s cheeks and up his back. Jeff simultaneously got off into Matts hand.<br />
Jeff thought he felt Matts orgasm. He just thought it was his own excitement; but the feeling felt as if it was out of his body. What was going on?!<br />
 Jeff tried to withdraw; but couldn&#39;t. He felt like he was stuck; and that his dicks sensation went through Jeff and into Jeff&#39;s rock hard member. He knew he could feel his own hand on His own member; but that would be impossible. Matt strained backwards , but only felt his groin skin stretching out from Jeff&#39;s behind and a strange pulling sensation from deep within Jeff.<br />
Coming out of his  ecstasy, Jeff felt the strange pulling of his groin skin from his butt. Wait- what? <br />
&quot;I&#39;m stuck to you somehow,&quot; said Matt. Maybe there were chemicals I here that rubbed onto us during dressing?&quot; <br />
&quot;Maybe-&quot; said Jeff.  See if you can work your free hand down between us and separate us.&quot; Deep in his mind, Jeff knew this wouldn&#39;t work.<br />
Matt ran his hand down his torso toward the sticking point between them. All his hand did was run on smooth skin all the way down his treasure trail, across the top of Jeff&#39;s butt, and then up Jeff&#39;s back.<br />
There was no seam.<br />
&quot;WHOA- we are somehow fused together!! What the fuck is going on, Jeff?!&quot; My dick is gone somewhere in you!&quot;<br />
&quot;That can&#39;t be right; but it would explain why I think I can feel other parts of your body like its my own!&quot;<br />
Matt reached down again to feel- but his trip was shorter- his belly button and six pack were gone. The skin connecting them had risen up Jeff&#39;s back and swallowed his abdomen!<br />
&quot;It&#39;s increasing!&quot; Said Matt.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s gotta be the suit!&quot; Exclaimed Jeff. &quot;There was some sort of odd disclaimer about bonding; I thought it was tongue in cheek about the fun we would have!&quot;<br />
Matt felt down his legs and found that the merging was traveling down their legs too.<br />
He reached between their legs to check his balls and gasped. His balls had moved forward and merged with Jeff&#39;s to become a four ball sac. The stroking of their conjoined balls sent a wave of calm through them both and started the arousal again. Matt rubbed harder, which made him and Jeff drop their inhibitions further. The haze of arousal drew Matt into thrusting harder into Jeff. Each time he heaved, more parts of their body fused. Every time more dyson took place, their arousal creshendo&#39;d to ever higher levels. Matt&#39;s entire chest was now fused into Jeff&#39;s back; their shoulders were knitting the separate muscles together to form large shoulders bigger than either of them. Their new combined shoulders started to push outward on the suit fabric.<br />
Their legs had merged down to their knees; and Matts toes had already joined with Jeff&#39;s heels.<br />
Matts free hand was pulled back up to twist and blend with Jeff&#39;s outstretched arms. The straps of the suit that were holding them together began to soften and become more sinewy than fabric.  Matt kicked his feet forward one last time ; blending forcefully with Jeff&#39;s. The resulting tree trunks for legs pushed the suit fabric taught.<br />
All that was left was their heads. Matt nuzzled the back of Jeff&#39;s head.<br />
&quot; Are we gonna be alright? Matt grunted as the awesome power of their combined body surged ever closer to orgasm.<br />
&quot;Yes- get inside my head!&quot; Jeff reared his head back into Matt&#39;s face. Matt&#39;s head splashed up and over Jeff&#39;s scalp, bringing their two brains together and triggering an orgasmic eruption that burned the walls of their minds down. All of their individual memories were now laid bare; each could see every nook and cranny of the other&#39;s mind. But- their consciences didn&#39;t merge;. It was as if they were overlaid each other: enough coordinated to move as one body; but had two separate thought processes driving the vessel.<br />
Their combined face swirled; trying to figure out what it wanted to be. It swelled; filling out the sumo costume&#39;s mask. Their combined body continued to swell- filling out every inch of the costume. <br />
&quot;Are we becoming the suit? Yes we are!&quot;<br />
The sumo suit fabric let off steam; softening and merging with the body inside. The fake hair bun on top rooted into heir scalp. The sewn on loincloth separated; and tried to do its job of concealing their 4-pack of jewels.<br />
The newly formed Jeff-Matt-sumo wrestler open its eyes, and considered what to do next.<br />
&quot;Shall we go win this costume contest? We  shall!&quot;</p>
