<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica woke up and reached over to her bedside table for her glasses. She put them on, she had needed glasses since she was eight and so had been wearing them for six years now. She liked them, they were large and took over about half of her face. But she liked the style. She checked the clock. It was only 6 o&#39;clock, not even her mom would be up yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jane had always somewhat resented Jessica, she knew it wasn&#39;t her fault but she had always felt she was responsible for ruining her childhood. She had only had her at thirteen and her mom wouldn&#39;t let her have an abortion. <br />
<br />
She decided to get ready anyway, it just meant she would be waiting a while longer. But she didn&#39;t mind too much. She went and took a quick shower and then she put on her underwear, lace panties and a d cup bra. She had always been quite busy for her age. Her mom said she got it from her, which made sense seeing as she was an f cup naturally. She then put on her clothes. A pair of blue leggings, a white skirt that reached her knees, a blue shirt and a black hoodie.<br />
<br />
She went downstairs and made herself some breakfast, ate it and went back upstairs. She looked at the clock again, 7 o&#39;clock. Everyone would just be waking up. <br />
<br />
Jane got out of bed and went to check on Sam. She couldn&#39;t understand why he was still wetting himself. All of her other children had stopped when they were three, he was now double that age. Granted he was small and immature. For these reasons when ever someone asked how old he was she always said three to everyone who didn&#39;t know. She had begun to convince herself he actually was three. He took more naps, needed more attention, cried more and was the only one out of the four she still breast fed. <br />
<br />
She walked into his bedroom to find him just waking up. She picked him up under the arms and held him against her waist. She pulled his covers back to check is his sheets were wet. It wasn&#39;t as if she needed an answer. They were soaked. She put him down on the changing table and changed his diaper. She then changed his clothes. She put his onesie in his hamper and dressed him in a t-shirt and shorts. She then sat on a chair next to his bed and pulled her shirt down to reveal a white nursing bra. She pulled it down to reveal her F cup breasts. Sam instantly latched on to one and began to suckle. She switched him onto her other one after about a minute and let him drink from her left breast as well.<br />
<br />
She woke up Greg and Michael, told them to get ready. She asked Jessica to help them, she did. <br />
<br />
Once everyone was ready to go out Sam asked where they were going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Sammie. You, Greg and Michael are all going to spend the day at the daycare center whilst me and Jessica go and but some things okay?&quot; Jane said. Sam looked at the floor and nodded.<br />
<br />
They all got in the car and drove in silence to the daycare center. It was a small building. But looked big enough to take care of about twenty children.<br />
<br />
Greg, Michael and Sam got out of the car with Jane . Jane took them by hand and led them up the walkway to the front door. Jane rang the doorbell and a few moments later the owner opened the door. She took Greg and Michael from Aunt carol and then Jane proceeded to tell the owner (Sherry) that she wanted her to watch Sam for the day as well. She told her about how he wasn&#39;t potty trained and how he was still being breast fed. She then handed Sherry the diaper bag that she packed saying their were diapers in the bag for Sam. When Jane left Sherry took Sam inside the house. Sam followed Sherry into her living room. Some kids ranging from 3-5 were sitting around the TV watching cartoons. The room had 2 long couches on either side, a recliner chair, a little kid play table, and some little plastic chairs around the table. Sam walked in the room and sat on the couch just thinking he could get away with watching TV and being left alone for the time that he was there.<br />
<br />
After a little while of watching TV a teenage girl came around checking all the kids that had diapers. She would feel the front of kids diapers and then peek in the back. While she was going around she came over to Sam and asked if he wore pull ups or a diaper. He responded kind of nervous &quot;no&quot;, but she didn&#39;t seem to believe him and put her hand on his bottom and squeezing saying it felt like he had one on. She undid the straps on his overalls and pulled them off leaving him in just a white T-shirt and a pull up. She felt the front of the diaper giving it a squeeze saying that it didn&#39;t feel too wet and then leaned in and looked down the back of it saying he didn&#39;t have any poopies. She asked him if he needed to go potty. He told her no even though he did have to pee a little bit, but didn&#39;t want to have to sit on a potty chair in front of everyone. She said okay and put his cargo overalls back on. His diaper was a little wet from the dribbling he kept doing in them, but was not soaked, only a little damp. The girl took the kids that needed a change or to go potty one at a time to either change them or sit them on the potty. After about 20 minutes he felt himself peeing in his diaper a lot without really trying. The diaper now felt very warm and heavy. He looked down at my crouch and could see that it looked puffy around his crouch under the overalls. He just sat there for awhile assuming the caretaker or the girl would not be around to check pull ups and diapers for awhile. Some of the kids who got bored of TV where playing on the rug with some toys that were there. He didn&#39;t want to get up because he knew that his diaper would sag too much and look obvious that he wet himself.<br />
<br />
The kid that was sitting next to him on the couch left to play on the floor so he had room to lay sideways on the couch propping his head up with his hand watching the TV wishing he could go home. He kept feeling the front of the pull up with his hand while watching TV, it felt neat to have it squishing around. He wasn&#39;t too fond of the damp feeling the diaper had as the pee became cold and around his wee wee felt clammy. Sherry came around and asked who wanted some juice. He was so thirsty he asked for some.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, mister you don&#39;t get juice, you get mommy milk.&quot; Sherry said as she produced one of her J cup breasts. Sam immediately latched on and drank hungrily. She switched him onto her other breast so he could drink out of that one. She then pulled her shirt down and left to get juice for all of the other children<br />
<br />
After 30 minutes the milk had made its way through him and he felt himself peeing into the already full diaper. The dialer couldn&#39;t hold the pee and he felt pee trickling down his legs . He inspected the overalls and found that the pee showed all down his legs and wet spots could be seen easily on the edge of his crotch and bottom. When the teenage girl was coming around to collect all the cups and sippy cups from the kids she saw his current state. She took hin by the hand and led him into the kitchen where Sherry was making lunch for all the kids. Sherry told the girl to clean him up and put his overalls in the washer machine. He was taken over to another room by the girl. He asked the girl what her name was; trying to pay it off that he was actually some dumb toddler who didn&#39;t know any better. She told him her name was Sarah and asked me what mine was. He told her his name while she pulled him into a room with a changing table and a lot of changing supplies. The girl took off his overalls to reveal his saggy diaper which was barely still on his waist. She ripped the sides of the pull up to have it *plonk* to the floor. He stood there with his little boyhood exposed to Sarah. She didn&#39;t seem to mind the least bit. She placed her hands under his hairless armpits and lifted him up onto the changing table. She pushed his chest with one hand and forced him to lay on his back. She grabbed some baby wipes. She then grasped his ankles and pulled them up to his chest so she could wipe down his privates. He felt so vulnerable to have this girl wiping him down with a wet wipe. When she was done she took out a pull up from the bag Jane left Sherry. She threaded his feet into the leg whole of the diaper and pulled them up to his knees. She then took him by the armpits and stood him flat on the floor. She grasped the sides of the diaper and pulled them firmly up his waist. Sarah told him that he could go back and play. She said that when his pants were finished being washed he could wear them again, but for now what he had on would do.<br />
<br />
He walked out into the living room not wanting to draw too much attention to the fact that he didn&#39;t have any pants on. Only one other kid had his diapers in plain site and he looked to be only 2. He went back to his spot on the couch to see that their was a wet spot where he had been sitting. He sat on the other side of the couch and tried to not draw attention to himself. Sarah came in with some cleaning supplies and cleaned up the wet spot on the couch. This drew the attention of all the kids in the room. Everyone was looking at Sarah cleaning the spot and clearly saw that Sam no longer had any pants on. One of the kids asked why she was cleaning the spot, Sarah plainly said that Sammie had a little accident and she was just cleaning it up. When she was done she walked out of the room to put the cleaning supplies back. She came back moments later and did another diaper check, she didn&#39;t bother even checking Sam&#39;s diaper. She just asked if he needed to go to the potty. He actually did have to go. He felt a cramp in my stomach that told me he needed to go number 2. She took me to the bathroom and placed a potty chair on the toilet, it made it so he could sit on the big person potty, and it had a splash protector. Sarah stripped off my pull ups and sat him on the training seat and put a stool under his feet. Sarah stood in the doorway and watched him. He still was not quite use to being naked in front of people, never mind going the bathroom in front of them. It took him a little bit, but he must have really had to go because he didn&#39;t really have to push it out, it just kinda came out. He peed a little too. When he was done Sarah asked me if he was all set. He told her he was, so she got some wet wipes and had him lean forward so she could clean his bum. It was a weird feeling to have someone else wipe his butt. He had his head pushed into her chest while she was leaned over my back pulling him forward so she could get to his bottom. When she was done wiping him she took him off the potty and pulled the diaper back up. He went back into the living room while Sarah got everyone else who needed to go to the bathroom handled.<br />
<br />
 Sherry called for all the kids to come into the kitchen for some lunch. Everyone got up and went to the kitchen. She let the big kids take their food to the living room while she got the younger ones (Sam) in booster seats and high chairs around the table. She made us mac and cheese with some hot dogs cut up in it. Sam had a bib tied around his neck and so did a lot of the younger kids. He was also given a sippy cup with apple juice in it. He drank and ate his meal. <br />
 When everyone was done she told us that it was nap time for the little kids. She made the big kids go outside and play while she set up mats in the living room. She told them that 2 people could have the couch while the other 4 could sleep on the mats. She told them that she would be right back with pillows and blankets, saying she had to first put the babies to sleep in the nursery. Sam picked the couch that he had been sitting on for most of the day. Sherry came back with some blankets and pillows handing them all a pillow and a light blanket. Before they could go to sleep her and Sarah went around and took off all of their clothes except diapers,pull ups, and undies. Sam only had to have his shirt removed. He laid down on the couch, The shades were shut and the lights were turned off. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
Sam woke up to the sounds of kids playing outside. He looked around and noticed that everyone else was gone, probably outside now playing. Sherry came in about 5 minutes later and saw that he was awake. She put his T-Shirt on saying that he could play outside with the rest of the kids till his mom came to pick him, Greg and Michael up. He went outside and saw that some of the kids were playing tag while others were drawing with chalk on the driveway. He decided to just sit in the shade on the porch. He sat there for only about 30 minutes before Jane  pulled up. Jane came up to me asking what happened to his overalls. He told her that he had an accident, and she just smiled saying it&#39;s okay. Sherry gave Jane the overalls that were now clean as well as her diaper bag. We all got into the car were Jessica was waiting.<br />
<br />
They all drove home and went inside, Jane checked the time. 6 o&#39;clock, past Sam&#39;s bedtime. She picked him up and took him to his bedroom where she sat down on the rocking chair and again breastfed him. She then put him down to bed in a fresh diaper and onesie.<br />
<br />
She put the monitor next to his bed and put the receiver in her own room. She then went to check on Jessica who was changing into the new clothes she had bought herself. She didn&#39;t pay her much attention instead she went to check on Greg and Michael.<br />
<br />
Jessica didn&#39;t really care that her mom left alone. It meant she could try on her new clothes in peace. The first thing she put on was a pair of nylons and then over that she put on one of the new girdles she had bought herself. She then changed into one of her new bras, turned out she was actually an E and not a D as she had thought. Over her bra and girdle she put on a corset. She looked at her self in the mirror. She liked her new clothes, in fact she thought she looked quite mature. She could probably pass for eighteen. <br />
<br />
She kept these clothes on until bedtime, and was about to take them off but decided instead to keep them on when she went to bed. She was definitely excited for the next day to say the least.</p>
