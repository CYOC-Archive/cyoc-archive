<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucas Brinn was preparing for his nightly performance when he was told about the supposed drug going around Amsterdam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luc,&quot; Cam spoke up as he poked his head into the room, &quot;You should really hear about this! New drug that I&#39;ve heard patrons have started sharing with---&quot; He winced when he saw Lucas was in the midst of preparing for the night.<br />
<br />
The young man - all of 23 - was the bastard offspring of a wealthy Norwegian man and his mistress, having been given up when the affair came out. He grew up on the rough streets and, even though he developed into fine, pretty features, there was a roughness to him that spoke to his troubled upbringing. He had settled once he came of legal age into the profession of the prostitute, becoming one of the more popular &quot;sons of the night&quot;. His curly blond hair, lightly tanned skin, blue eyes, effete and pretty features, as well as his lean, muscular build all lent him the looks that brought renewed and consistent interest.<br />
<br />
Dressed currently in a pair of tight leather pants designed to show off his well toned legs and buttocks, his short sleeved button up shirt rested on the chair beside him. After all, Lucas needed to do some upkeep before he participated in the lead up to the nightly events.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cam...&quot; Lucas groaned with displeasure as he halted what he was doing, &quot;This had best be some very interesting new drug, because you interrupted when I was in the middle of trimming my body hair. Any scarring and---&quot; The presence of a scar or fresh cut from the razor might negatively impact his earnings - and that was more than Lucas was willing to tolerate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I know, Luc,&quot; Cameron responded nervously, &quot;But I couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing myself about this drug, until I saw a video of it at work. I---I uh, you should see it.&quot; Cameron was another of the young men working at the brothel - a boyishly handsome dark haired young man with a slightly stocky build, not quite as tall as Lucas, though the two often shared customers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaah...&quot; Lucas shook his head and set down his electric razor, &quot;Just show me what you want to show me already, so I can get back to making sure I&#39;m ready for tonight&#39;s guests.&quot; <br />
<br />
Producing his phone, Cameron ushered Lucas over - and scrolled through a few videos on a sharing service preferred by people in their line of work. Usually, it was utilized to compare notes, give tips or assistance to the newer workers and in certain situations, talk about problematic or disturbing clientele who should be avoided, but today it was showing something that defied everything Lucas knew. The video alleged this drug - Transformex - could change and alter the human body in a number of ways pending on the &quot;type&quot; constructed and the amount consumed.<br />
<br />
At first reading the video description, Lucas was ready to scoff and chide Cameron for being so readily deceived by such a thing...and then he saw who it was made by. And watched the video himself, eyes slowly widening as he saw the client, a slender German young man, quaff a potion as he went to have sex with Claudia - who Lucas knew was 1) not skilled enough with computers to engineer such a hoax and 2) someone he knew would not make such a thing up - being a woman who valued the truth.<br />
<br />
And so as Lucas watched, he saw the slender German grow over the course of the sexual encounter into a well endowed, older looking adonis of a man. The two boy-whores both registered their surprise - Lucas&#39; eyes widening, and Cameron more readily showing a lustful response to the ravishing their occasional coworker received from her client.<br />
<br />
&quot;How---what in the world---?&quot; Lucas murmured as the video finished. He didn&#39;t know anything that could achieve a result as drastic as what he saw. It was like something out of fantasy or the distant, mythologized past... &quot;Is---Is it permanent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody knows if it is truly the work of magic, or unusual, black market science...&quot; Cameron spoke as evenly as possible, all the while adjusting his fat crotch, &quot;But it&#39;s pretty clear that it works, whatever it is. And going by how that client&#39;s moaning, it feels pretty good, regardless what it does. And no, no it&#39;s not permanent. It might not be legal if it was. It wears off after an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...So?&quot; Lucas paced back and forth, eager to get back to his preparation, &quot;I don&#39;t make a big habit out of drug use while I work with a client. And I generally don&#39;t like working with clients who&#39;re on stuff. Seems like it could lead to some issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just saying, man,&quot; Cameron responded, &quot;Keep an open mind on this stuff. You never know what you might like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, Cam,&quot; The young man stated, and then got back to his preparations. He was relieved when the door shut behind Cameron on his way out. Still, that whole video had planted some curiosity in Lucas, and he was left wondering, indeed, if the whole transformative experience was indeed on average pleasant...might he be interested in exploring such an experience? If he was sure the occasion was under control, definitely. He didn&#39;t want to be placed into a dangerous situation.<br />
<br />
He got enough of that by dint of his work as a prostitute, and a male prostitute at that. <br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
Once Lucas was done with his preparations, he was good to go in joining the stage at the center of the brothel. Theirs was a high class establishment, and they liked to make sure everyone present was doing what they did of their own free will. Each young man and woman had their own description on a menu handed out along with the meal menus when guests were seated. As a means to get people acclimated, the brothel - or &quot;Establishment&quot; as the higher ups called it - functioned just as well as a restaurant for the patrons. People would come in, eat, drink, be merry, and watch the very talented and gorgeous young men and women dance and entice the guests.<br />
<br />
Should they make a decision, the guest would be allowed to go up to a designated room with one of the prostitutes, who would perform a set number of sex acts they were comfortable with. Lucas was listed on the selection menu as &quot;Luxurious Lucas&quot; - with him being referred to as &quot;with his six pack abs, muscular body, and skilled dance routine, Lucas is one of the most scintillating men in our repertoire. Give him your evening and you won&#39;t regret it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas liked to believe he had more to him than just dance moves and abs. He saw a path forward for himself beyond this kind of life. But for now, he was a son of the night. And this was the life he had to lead to get the money and the connections for his path forward. After all, it was no secret that more moneyed and capable people in general preferred the higher class establishments as opposed to the dingy and desolate hotel-bound houses that operated less cleanly.<br />
<br />
Swaggering on stage, the handsome young man took to slowly removing his clothes for the benefit of the audience of men and women both. He didn&#39;t particularly mind whoever ended up purchasing his services, for whatever they wanted him for. There was no such a thing as gay money or straight money - there was just money.<br />
<br />
By the time Lucas was down to his tighty-whities, which nicely contrasted against his light tan and cut, muscular look he was the center of a lot of attention. Cameron was already heading over to give a lap dance to an older gay gentleman that Lucas had given one to the last few nights. Though it seemed like this time, the gentleman wanted to go up to a room with the dark haired young man.<br />
<br />
<i>Best of luck, Cameron,</i> Lucas thought, and then returned to his sexualized dance moves.<br />
<br />
He wondered who might be his romantic partner tonight...and whether he might end up being offered the chance at use of that drug. He knew it might be risky. But his curiosity had only grown, and he was eager to try something new. By the time someone from the audience called him over to their seat to give a lap dance and a trip up to the private room, Lucas enthusiastically started to walk over - always eager to please.</p>
