<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa had to admit the girls had out done themselves. Jason’s steak and Lisa’s salmon were fantastic,she wondered how they had managed to cook so well then shrugged. One of the perks of being rich was having a live cook. As she finished her dessert she now looked at Jason who looked equally stuffed.<br />
<br />
“Wow they really came through huh,” Jason breathed. “I haven’t that good in awhile.” Lisa nodded as she now lovingly looked at him. “So should we tell them the good news?” she asked. Jason now gazed back at the kitchen where he could see several faces dart out of view. “Yeah I think they’ve suffered enough,” he laughed.<br />
<br />
“Okay all of you come out I know you’ve been watching for the last hour,” Lisa yelled.<br />
<br />
Slowly the sliding door opened as Katie and her friends anxiously exited onto the porch. Katie and Gloria now anxiously gazed at their parents, hoping that all of their work had paid off.<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled as she looked at them. “You want to tell them or should I,” She asked Jason. He smiled as he gestured for Lisa to give the good news. “Well your little stunt paid off,” she said. “Jason and I worked things out, we’re going to take things slow and see how it goes.”<br />
<br />
Gloria screamed with joy as she ran to hug her father while the others cheered and hi fived each other. Katie smiled at Lisa thankful that this crazy plan had worked out. As Lisa now looked over the group she couldn’t help but notice Jennifer missing from the joyful masses. “Katie,” she said with a smile. “I see Jennifer isn’t out with the rest of you. Think you could go inside and help her CHANGE.”<br />
<br />
Katie blushed slightly as she now raced inside where a 40 year old Jennifer was watching. As she entered she could see Jennifer peaking outside, happy to have heard the news. “Hey Jen,” she called. “My Mom was wondering where you were. She wants to thank you in person, you ready to change back.”<br />
<br />
“Beyond ready,” she groaned. “I’m so ready to be 16 again, but I need to ask a favor when this is over okay?”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Katie said cautiously as she wished Jennifer back to 16. Jennifer sighed happily as she felt the tingles envelope her body once again. Happily she watched as her body began to retreat from middle age. She could only smile as she saw her body firm up and then shrink as she sped through her thirties and twenties. By the time she reentered the teens the girl was smiling as she ran her hands over her body. “Thanks,” she said in a youthful tone. “That was a surreal experience.”<br />
<br />
“So what did you want to ask me?” Katie questioned. Jennifer smiled before answering. “We can talk after right now let’s go congratulate your aunt.”<br />
<br />
As the two walked onto the porch they could see the group happily talking with Lisa and Jason. The two adults appeared to be enjoying themselves. Lisa, noticing Katie and Jennifer, now beckoned them over. “I wanted to thank you Jennifer for hosting this at your house,” she said. Jennifer blushed, thanking Lisa for her kind words.<br />
<br />
“Ashley and Jennifer really helped a lot with this,” Katie added. “We couldn’t come up with any ideas. They were the ones that came up with the plan.”<br />
<br />
“Impressive,” Lisa said as she rubbed her chin. <br />
<br />
“It’s nothing really,” Jennifer muttered as Ashley now stood by her side. “We....well...um,”<br />
<br />
“What Jen is trying to say is thank you for helping us,” Ashley finished. “We may not of thought so at the time but everything you did for us after the club made a difference. You...you really helped us out.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled as she now stood and hugged both girls tightly. Shocked at first, Ashley and Jennifer returned Lisa’s hug, a genuine smile spreading across their faces.<br />
<br />
As the group began to clean up from dinner Jennifer and Shiro now approached Katie. “Katie could we talk to you privately real quick,” she asked. Puzzled Katie followed the two into a side room where Mika was sitting. “Okay what’s going on,” she asked. Shiro and Jennifer sighed as they looked at Mika and Katie. “Look,” Jennifer sighed. “Shiro and I have been talking and well we, um we want to try dating. Each other.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, What,” Mika exclaimed. “Shiro what is this. Jennifer is too young, if you try dating her your gonna have a lot more problems than angry parents to worry about.”<br />
<br />
“We talked about it,” Shiro stated stiffly as he now held Jennifer’s hand. “That’s why we need Katie’s help.”<br />
<br />
“Hold up,” Mika yelled. “Are you telling me You want Jennifer to be older?”<br />
<br />
Shiro and Jennifer looked at each other before shaking their heads. Mika gaped as she now stared dumbfounded at her older brother. “You want to be younger!?!” She exclaimed. “No...no...oh hell no!”<br />
<br />
“Mika listen,” Shiro implored. “Look I..I know I haven’t been the best older brother. Hell I haven’t even been the best person but for some reason Jen sees something in me that even I didn’t know existed. I’m just asking for the chance to see what happens with us. I...I just wanted your permission before we went ahead with this.”<br />
<br />
Mika fumed as she looked at her brother and Jennifer. That her brother not only wanted to be with Jennifer but also wanted to become younger seemed almost impossible for her to take in. Mika now sat in a chair, her head hanging as she groaned in frustration. “Mika,” Katie said softly. “Listen I know this is a lot but maybe this could be good for both of them. It could be good for you too.”<br />
<br />
Mika sighed as she now thought things over. If Shiro was dating a white girl maybe things would be easier with her parents. While she had no desire to move back in with them she hated cutting them completely out of her life. “Ugh Fine,” she moaned. “Look I give you permission Shiro but their no chance I’m moving back home if mom and dad approve of this.”<br />
<br />
Shiro smiled as he looked at his sister. “Doubt they’ll approve maybe I end up at Kumiko too.”<br />
<br />
“I already claimed the guest bedroom you sleep in the basement.”<br />
<br />
Shiro smiled as he now turned to Katie. “Okay Katie lets do this.” Katie turned to Mika who, despite a sour look nodded in agreement with her brother. “Okay,” Katie sighed. “I wish Shiro was 16.”<br />
<br />
Shiro shivered as his regression began. The girls watched as Shiros features began to soften as he treated into his teens. Jennifer gaped as he shrank a couple of inches while his muscle thinned slightly. Although still an attractive guy he was no longer a man in his twenties. Now a teen with dark hair and a handsome face stood before them. Jennifer now looked at Shiro smiling before planting a firm kiss on him. Pulling apart Shiro gasped before smiling. “Well if that’s our first kiss I can’t wait for the second.”<br />
<br />
Jennifer giggled as she now cozied up next the Shiro. Katie and Mika just watched the new couple as they now walked out of the room arm and arm. “Just when I think that ring cant make things any weirder this happens,” Mika sighed. Katie nodded in agreement, things were definitely changing all the time. She now hoped it would be for the better.</p>
