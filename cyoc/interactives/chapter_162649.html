<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared had felt perfectly normal for being as changed by his magic coin, and wondered long hence before he was as transformed, wanting to know more of what it was like being a horse. To his surprise, most of what a horse or stallion could do happen within a few of his first hours when as a horse. Jasper’s mentality was stronger than that of a teenage boy, but the human wits won the day as the horse mentality learned to better appreciate what it was to being a human.<br />
<br />
As Jared stood being the desiring force managing the horse body, he stood calmly by while his dad washed the stallion genitals clean. Jared had done as much to other stallion after they bred or mated with a mare. To leave the mix of body fluids to dry, as become encrusted on the horse cock was to give the stallion some likelihood of getting some type of venereal disease.<br />
<br />
A servicing of the stallion required as well the use of a Que-tip swab to pluck open the distal end and rotating the swab, pluck out from a small indentured pouch a residue lump; what if left there could partially block the piss-hole and cause further problems. Jared knew the process but not all the technical terms, yet he liked his times when allowed to fondle the cock of a stallion.<br />
<br />
Jasper’s male animal mentality had come so far watching of Jared controlling of his stallion self to begin trusting Jared. As warm water was sponged about the sheath it tended to relax a stallion and then the penis would drop out from the sheath. A second drenching of warm water along the length of the stallion penis did more to arouse the horse-cock to bloat as stiffen. A stiff penis was easier to wash clean and then when toweled dry, like had Jared, he would dribble a silky oil into the palm of his hand and message the cock from where it joined the sheath to along the cock body and thumb-rubbed all over the cock tip.<br />
<br />
Jared’s dad was doing the washing and full processing of his famous stallion and had as much ignored that the life entity living inside the horse was his teenage son.<br />
<br />
A midst the washing and Mr. Morrison remembered he had no towel to dry the penis body, and rose to standing, he noted the torn shirt what Jared donned on that morning. It happened then when Bob went to retrieve as planned to use the shirt that he felt the round weight of the coin as still inside the shirt pocket.<br />
<br />
Plucking the shiny big coin from the shirt pocket, Mr. Morrison displayed his finding of it to Jared, as when the horse eyes saw the coin, caused Jared to whinny and become as quite nervous.<br />
<br />
“You wrote that this caused you to become as was Jasper, of the fact that Jasper is here and alive with you capable to communicate, forces me to believe that magic is real. I wish to know more about this coin and its magical properties?” Mr. Morrison said, as posed a non-life changing question.<br />
<br />
“Yes my new Master, you would wish to know more about the capabilities of my Spirit self, the living entity alive as blessed to be a Grand Magical Medallion.” The coined spirit said, but not aloud, as he mentally communicated with Mr. Morrison, and startled the man to where he dropped the shirt.<br />
<br />
“Hello, as I can here you, but not with my ears, like you are inside my head. I would like to learn more of how my teenage son became a horse?” Mr. Morrison asked, his voice sounding rather timid as anyone in the same situation might well expect.<br />
<br />
“My previous owner became a Master and youth being romantic, your son wished to know what it was like for living and realizing the sensations, of what a stallion feels and relishes. We spoke of what he wished to learn in the same way you are communicating with me, the Medallion Spirit. We came to an agreement, as such your son though a horse from Monday to a Friday night as at 6:00 pm, he would magically as physically revert back to being his boyish teenage self with one specific exception.<br />
<br />
The specified exception was that he desired to retain while being again human, asked to have the genitals of his stallion self, as part of his human anatomy.<br />
<br />
He has the ability to switch from being an equine stallion to being his more human bodily self for more days than just from a Friday night to a timely return come Monday morning at 6:00 am. As of those extra days when as being his human self, he must by the rules of his curse, serve the curse then through the following weekends, he remaining as is his stallion horse self until the days of service to his curse is equal again.<br />
<br />
His lusty desire to be as transformed is as much a permanent situation that he must bear, as his embodiment is now that of an equine animal as the horse you knew as named Jasper!” The Medallion Spirit reiterating did so explain.<br />
<br />
“Permanent, but why would my son wishing, to be then continually a horse as his bodily form, I recall he had plans to become a Veterinarian?” A disgruntled father asked the Medallion Spirit.<br />
<br />
“Youths rarely look toward the future, and tend to be short-sighted. My base purpose is to grant a Master the ability to change form from wearing of something not of their owned clothing. As what they don-on to wear, my power regulates their physical body to change, and become permanently a double of the person or animal what last wore the item. Your son Jared did not wear a jacket to working in the barn, and seeing the stack of horse blankets, he warped a blanket, as he said Velcro strapped about his shoulders. The Blanket was last worn by your stallion and stud horse named Jasper, and from his hairs and skin cells soiling the blanket, my power worked to adjust then Jared to become as was Jasper!” The Medallion Spirit so explained to a wondering father.<br />
<br />
“Then Jared did not make a wish to become a horse, it was your evil purpose what forced his body to being as changed!” Mr. Morrison stated his rationalization of the situation. “So how or why was there an agreement between Jared and you about his ability to revert back to his human self on the weekends?”<br />
<br />
“Ah-huh, your son wished to retain his religious beliefs and only as a human could he attend church services. He did not wish to break all ties with his loving parents, and at the same time found his being as is a horse and a stallion as attaining the youthful want for feeling sensual gratification. So like I said previously, youths generally ask for what services their momentary need or desire.” The Medallion explaining, said, but offered a concerned father and dad to feel sad for his son.</p>
