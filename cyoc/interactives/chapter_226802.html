<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex gnaws on the eraser tip of his pencil, furrowing his brow and screwing his eyes at the math homework laying out in front of him before scribbling down some work. No one ever said algebra was easy, and starting as early as he was in the sixth grade was down-right unheard of at his school. He honestly doesn’t enjoy math very much but doing it makes his parents proud of him. But more importantly, it makes them happy to treat him to special rewards the better he did. Alex sighs, eyes straining on the stack of loose-leaf sheets of paper with math problems scribbled all over then. He’s starting to get tired, eyes slowly screwing shut until, suddenly, one of his parents’ “rewards” leaps up on the table in front of him.<br />
<br />
“H-hey!” Alex frowns, unable to stop the nimble pet cat that he’d just got today from hopping up on his desk and haunching down right atop his homework. “Gugh… why’d you gotta pick there of all places to sit…?”<br />
<br />
The night-black cat sits there for a moment, starring at the boy with her gleaming red eyes as a sly felid smile grows on her face. “’Cause you were doing on awful lot of looking over here, I thought I’d give you something nice to look at!”<br />
<br />
Alex lets out an annoyed huff, reluctantly giving his new pet some attention by stroking her across her back. “You know… You’re a lot less cute since you started talking, Kitty…”<br />
<br />
“Well excuuuuse me-ow.” The cat lets out a purring giggle in the girlish voice she uses, “I’d be happy to do the ‘ditzy meowing kitty’ routine but I’ve been meowing at you all day and still don’t seem to get what I want.”<br />
<br />
His new pet cat is so strange. Out of the blue she had started talking recently, not speaking a word of English to anyone but him.<br />
<br />
“Kitty, I just got done petting you for like half-an-hour not too long ago…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. That was nice… but not what I wanted.” The cat responds, getting up on all fours and stroking her fuzzy head against Alex’s cheek. “And why are you still calling me ‘Kitty’? I have a name you know.”<br />
<br />
She reaches a paw to her collar, jingling the fish-shaped nametag in front of her owner’s face.<br />
<br />
“I’m not calling you that…” Alex crosses his arms, turning away from her. <br />
<br />
“Call me what…?” The cat teases, leaning in over the desk, rubbing her head on the back of Alex’s neck.<br />
<br />
“Poundcake.” Alex grumbled.<br />
<br />
“There! You do know it!”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a weird name! Why on earth would your old owners give you a name like that?”<br />
<br />
“Aww… you want me to show ya why?” Poundcake says with a lascivious purr as she spins herself around on Alex’s desk, hiking her tail up high.<br />
<br />
Alex stares wide-eyed at carnal display in front of him. Poundcake’s jet-black rear is plump for a cat’s, her slick, soft fur trailing down her flanks, terminating at a dark-skinned feline anus and followed by a pair of trembling pussy lips. They look wet, the spotlight shining from his desk lamp illuminating dribbling droplets of moisture slipping down her black, swollen flesh, dripping off her cunt and oozing down the loose-leaf paper in sticky strands of bestial heat.<br />
<br />
“Or maybe… you swing the other way…” the cat’s voice says in a sing-songy ring as her voice starts to shift, slightly deeper – boyish even. Poundcake’s tail swings like a pendulum, obscuring her drooling genital for a mere moment until it passes over them, changing them instantly. She is a he now, his pussy shifting into a fuzzy black scrotum, cat balls jostling against each other as his tail swings over them again, bringing those glistening pussy lips back.<br />
<br />
“Go on. Stop my tail wherever you like.” Poundcake arches his head over her shoulder with a coy smile, his voice shifting from female to male and back again. “I’ll drop the talk and start meowing for you too. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Alex isn’t having any of it, grasping Poundcake by her waist and setting her on the floor again. “I’m NOT calling you Poundcake.” He reiterates, ducking his head back down towards his desk, continuing with his math homework like that never happened.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” the cat leaps back onto Alex’s desk glaring at him with in frustration. “Are you that oblivious?! Sex! S-E-X! Do you get what I want now?!”<br />
<br />
Alex shoves the cat away from his homework again, glaring right back at her. “Yeah! I figured when you shoved your butt in my face. And NO, I’m not gonna do it with my cat! That’s wrong!”<br />
<br />
“Then why’d you even adopt me?! What’s the point of having the best cat in the whole world if you don’t wanna bang me?!” Poundcake lets out a house cat growl. “Stop being boring and do something fun!”<br />
<br />
Alex doesn’t respond, ignoring Poundcake, keeping his eyes fixed on the homework in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Fine… how about this…” The black cat storms of the desk in a huff, only to hop back up holding a mouse-on-a-string cat toy in her maw. “I’m mad now and I wanna chase something. I wanna chase this. Wave this around for me. You can at least do that, right?”<br />
<br />
Alex stays silent for a few more seconds before muttering. “This is due tomorrow and I’m tired… Just leave me alone, Kitty…”<br />
<br />
Poundcake drops the mouse toy and struts up to her owner with an indignant look, butting her head against Alex’s forehead. “We’re. Playing. Chase.” She hisses.<br />
<br />
“We’re NOT!” Alex snorts back at her, looking up only to see those deep red eyes glaring into his.<br />
<br />
An odd feeling of foreboding suddenly rattles the boy’s spine as those hellish marble-like orbs peer unblinkingly into his. She’s just a cat… too small to hurt him, but… for some reason it starts to feel like he’s having a starring contest with a tiger, those gleaming eyes starting to look down on him, getting bigger and bigger… or… is he getting smaller?<br />
<br />
As those feral feline eyes petrify Alex in place, his clothes start to feel baggy. The boy sinks lower into his chair as Poundcake looms heavily over him, her irate scowl turning into a mirthful smile as her owner&#39;s size diminishes. Alex couldn’t look away… but he feels what is happening. Silky soft white fuzz sprinkles itself all over his body as his clothes peeled away from his skin, the pencil in his hand getting heavier and heavier until it started to feel more like a wooden log in his tiny paws. His teeth chatter, lengthening into buck-toothed pearly whites as his ears grow large and membranous over his head.<br />
<br />
He hears Poundcake much better now – he can smell her vividly too, as if all his senses are focusing on her, rattling a warning siren to him – and for good reason. Poundcake is more of a Kaiju than a cat now, her sheer size eclipsing the light shining from the lamp on his desk, casting him in her shadow.<br />
<br />
The changing boy’s throat suddenly erupts with a pained squeak as his elongated and flattened, forcing him onto all fours as a pink, fleshy tail the size of his whole body sprouts out in a matter of seconds. He didn’t look away from the monstrous predator licking her chops in his direction, but he could feel what had happened, recalling the mouse toy Poundcake had brought to him just a minute earlier when he was still human. He knew he was the same size as the toy now. A comically tiny pair of his glasses was all that was left after the changes to suggest he was ever human. Now, he is just a small, white mouse - made to be chased.<br />
<br />
Alex rips his gaze of the sphinx-sized cat he used to call his pet, wading through his discarded underwear before leaping down onto the floor below. The massive drop hurts the new mouse’s paws, but he doesn’t have any time to nurse his wounds. He hurriedly peers around the room, no-longer seeing it as a sanctuary for him to sleep, but as a hunting-ground for Poundcake. His eyes dart this way and that as he looks for any nook and cranny that he can squeeze his way through that the cat couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Times up. His hearing has become so good he can hear the giant muscles in the cat’s legs start to piston, the monstrous feline nimbly leaping to the ground with a playful, wagging tail, landing like an earthquake right in front of him. Alex stares at her again like a deer in headlights, a mouse’s perfect predator looking down at him expectantly. She could easily kill him right now, but she doesn’t… yet.<br />
<br />
“Well? Aren’t you gonna run?” her voice booms overhead, the former-boy panicking as he takes off in a full four-legged sprints, tears streaming down his murine muzzle as he closes his eyes and runs as fast as he can.<br />
<br />
Poundcake looks on unimpressed as her prey runs around the center of the room in circles, not even getting up to walk as her paw strikes out like a bolt of lightening, stopping Alex in his tracks by his tail.<br />
<br />
The boy-turned-mouse wails out a squeak of terror as he senses his pet’s paw immobilize him, only for her to suddenly release her grasp.<br />
<br />
“No. Like, run away better. Make it fun.” Poundcake reiterates, shoving Alex’s rear to make him start running again, but he just can’t. His little heart is close to beating out of his chest, the tired mouse sprawled out on the floor completely exhausted, unable to do much except to accept his fate.<br />
<br />
Poundcake batted him with her paw again this way and that, Alex tumbling around on the carpet like a ragdoll a few times, unable to get back up on his feet and escape. The black cat relents, letting out a sigh as she droops her head down, opening up her maw and wrapping her felid lips around Alex’s shivering form.<br />
<br />
The exhausted mouse closes his eyes, gritting his teeth, waiting for the apex mouse-killer to snap his spine and bring him to a gory end for denying her for sex as a human; but it doesn’t come. Her lips gingerly nip down in the loose skin on his back as he’s lifted up, her cat breath drawing the little mouse to tears. She nimbly jumps up in the air, making Alex feel like he was flying for a moment until they both land up top his desk. Poundcake prods around the loose-leaf papers like a cat bed, tearing a few of them to shreds before plopping down in a cat ball, setting the trembling mouse right in the center.<br />
<br />
“You really, really aren’t any fun…” the cat mews with a huff, arching her head towards the tiny white ball of mouse fuzz. She presses her muzzle against him and pins him between her head and belly before for scratchy tongue peaks out to lick him. She strokes him with lap after lap of gooey kitten kisses, trying to calm him down in only a way a cat could like. “You aren’t even fun as prey, you know that? I wasn’t gonna hurt you. I thought if you were scared to death, you’d at least make it interesting…”<br />
<br />
Alex is having trouble understanding her through all those wet slurps against his ears, his entire back getting stroked with the flick of her tongue as his face swims in an ocean of Poundcake’s silky-soft ebony fur. He can feel her heartbeat softly bouncing him up and down, her whole body rumbling with a satisfied purr as she starts to feel her owner-turned-mouse begin to relax.<br />
<br />
Alex is at the precipice of heaven and hell, his instincts screaming that a predator was tasting him, the human-part of his brain seeped in utter bliss as he begins to enjoy being tasted. In the right light, this predator 200 times his size was like a dark angel, a God-send touching Alex in ways no human has ever been touched before. Trapped beneath that musky predator exterior was her sweet feminine scent, a soothing counterpoint to the instinctual fear instilled in all mice. It says that despite the species difference and her dwarfing him in size, she’s a girl and he’s a boy. He could feel it. He liked her now. He loved his cat.<br />
<br />
“P-poundcake…” The mouse squeaks out a moan that made the cat’s ears stand on edge. She smiles with a coy grin, using her muzzle to flip Alex over so his back was to her belly so that they could look at each other.<br />
<br />
She doesn’t say a word, her gleaming red eyes signaling her intentions as her giant muzzle dips down to his tiny, white-fuzzed tube of murine boyhood. Alex grasps onto her whiskers as her moist cat lips lightly knead that tube of mouse sheath, hot puffs of cat breath coaxing his tiny tapered pink penis out, flicking her tongue over it until it’s at full mast.<br />
<br />
“Mrow~” she purrs, keeping her promise that she’d wouldn’t talk once they understood each other. Her feral voice makes Alex shiver with a heady tincture of fear and lust the likes of which no human could ever experience.<br />
<br />
Her tongue stroked his penis up and down, covered it in a thick glaze of cat drool as her chin softly jostled his murid balls, feeling them grow hefty with her owner’s first orgasm of his whole life. A tinge of shame seeps into his mind at what was happening, but the thought that he was losing his virginity to a house cat just adds to the heady mix of emotions that made his little mouse cock throb. He loves it – loves being an animal, a taboo wish forming deep in his heart wishing that he’d never change back – that he could spend the rest of eternity pleasured by this giantess of a feline! His paws clench as he screwed his eyes tight, a blast of mouse cum spewing out of his little cock, landing right on Poundcake’s tongue.<br />
<br />
She purrs, stroking Alex’s throbbing murid pride over and over but the tiny trickles of cum don’t stop. Unbeknownst to Alex mice are breeding machines. An almost non-existent refectory period lets Alex the mouse feed his feline girlfriend trickle after trickle of salty jizz. She let him cum for five full minutes, Alex squeaking and writhing underneath her tongue as predator milked her prey lover over and over again.<br />
<br />
Then, Poundcake makes it stop. She tenderly nips Alex’s head in her cum-drenched maw, picking him up and setting him down on something thick, hard, and… spikey.<br />
<br />
“Ow. Ow.” Alex squeaked as he was suddenly dragged away from euphoria and stuck somewhere much less pleasant. The boy-turned-mouse had trouble making out where he was since every part of Poundcake was pitch black except her eyes. He wrapped his forelegs around the hot what-ever-it-was, before figuring it out fast.<br />
<br />
Poundcake had changed her sex again. Her smell had shifted but wasn’t any worse. He has a cat dick now, and Alex is laying right on top of it.<br />
<br />
“Oops.” Poundcake snickers as he watches the mouse painful twitch on top of his barbed feline cock as if he was perched on top of a porcupine. “Just for now, let’s make it easier on you with something more familiar…”<br />
<br />
With a wave of his paw, Alex feels the cat’s dick grow plump, the harsh, spikey barbs lost underneath an almost rubbery expansion of softer, more sensual flesh. Alex holds on tight as the cat’s penis changes, the mouse feeling a fat glans sprout from the tapered tip as he realizes Poundcake’s addition is indeed familiar.<br />
<br />
It’s a human cock, uncut unless you count the sheath, completely jet-black just like the rest Alex’s magical pet. It’s only three-and-a-half inches long but that’s the size of Alex’s entire body now. The little mouse gets cradled on top that slick slab of kitty meet as it throbs underneath him. Alex’s mouse cock springs back to life as he humps away at that smooth humanoid kitty dick, lost in the all-encompassing smell of male cat as he softly kisses and licks the swollen glans of Poundcake’s cock.<br />
<br />
The cat purrs his encouragement, arching his head back, giving Alex a kiss before nipping his murine scruff again, dragging him up and off his cock, before plopping him down right in front of it. Poundcake guides his little owner, butting him in the rear until he gets propped up on his hind legs, his little erection rubbing against that giant cock tip, until…<br />
<br />
Alex squeaks as his tiny members sinks into his cat’s urethra, the searing hot walls making his dick sizzle as they hugged his penis with a tight grip. Instincts took over Alex’s mind as his forepaws clutch the underside of Poundcake’s dick, mounting the cat’s human-like cock as if it were a female mouse in heat. Pleasure beyond words escaped his lips as a series of blissful squeaks, his hefty balls spanking the cat’s cock as Poundcake let Alex take control, the cat purring happily, satisfied that he’d cracked his owner out of his shell – satisfied that he was thinking like an animal now.<br />
<br />
Alex cums, the pressure in his balls almost too much to fire out of his tiny prick as wave after wave of hot mouse jizz gets fired into Poundcake’s pisshole. The black cat stretches out like he’s getting a luxurious massage, the feline purring in bliss as he feels that hot mouse seed making its was to his balls, making them start to bloat. Poundcake joins in, beginning to hump gently against Alex’s jackhammering thrusts, the cat’s tongue hanging out, panting as his own orgasm hits its brink.<br />
<br />
The boy-turned-mouse feels it coming, feels Poundcake’s humanoid dick expands like a python as the tidal wave of jizz encompasses his little murine cock. He’s blasted backwards, toppling on his math homework as he’s covered head to tail in a deluge of kitty batter.<br />
<br />
Spurt after spurt of spunk audibly slops over him. Poundcake is aiming for him, loads of pearly-white, backed-up cat cum staining Alex’s fur. The mouse dips a paw down, masturbating his tapered penis as he gets buried in predator spooge. Alex’s tongue hangs out, lapping up as much of his pet’s jizz as he can, losing himself to bestial lust until he feels the reverberations of Poundcake moving again across his desk. Alex flips onto his back just in time for the huge cat to rest his cock on top of his owner. The mouse squeaks as that heavy, slab of cock flesh weighs down over him. The feline buries him in cat cock as Poundcake positions himself just so, covering him, sprawling out on top of him and taking a well-deserved cat nap, forcing his owner to snuggle his cock while he sleeps.<br />
<br />
______________________________<br />
<br />
An hour later, Alex happily gnaws on a Cheez-it, a box of which he’d had on standby for a homework snack. As Alex munches down on the giant treat, Poundcake gingerly cleans him off, lapping his dried-up cum from his owner’s silky-white fur. Alex swallows down a mouthful of cheeze cracker before looking down, noticing his homework was stained beyond recognition with his pet’s jizz.<br />
<br />
“Oh...” The mouse squeaks, “Poundcake, I like this… but… I still gotta do my homework. Look, it’s all ruined…”<br />
<br />
The cat pauses her licking, smiling playfully as she mimics Alex’s sister’s voice. “Um. Hi, Boring-ass Human School? This is Alex’s sister. I’m just calling you to say Alex couldn’t get his homework done ‘cause he’s drowning in kitty spunk!”<br />
<br />
Alex blushes, shaking his head vigorously at his pet cat. “Wh-what! You can’t say that! You can’t tell anyone that ever!”<br />
<br />
“Relax…” Poundcake purrs, licking Alex’s cheek before sucking his tiny pair of glasses into her mouth, cleaning those too. “I’ll just call your school and say you got Covid or something. Besides, I don’t think you’re gonna go back there anytime soon.”<br />
<br />
Alex tilts his head in confusion, “I-I’m not?”<br />
<br />
“You’re much more fun like this than you were a human. You like it more too.” Poundcake purrs right against the mouse’s whiskers. “I still owe you for adopting me from the pound, you know. How about you let your pet take care of you for once? Since you’re so small, there’s lots we can do.”</p>
