<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The year is around 68,999ad according to your calendar, and humanity is presumed extinct. However before the end humanity made it into the stars and established the most powerful empire the universe has ever known. In the beginning, humans found themselves alone in the universe and expanded unchallenged for thousands of years. They were in an underpopulated area of the galaxy, and this allowed them to lay claim unprecedented amounts of space and colonize them with increasing ease thanks to their near limitless resources. It was to the point that when they finally did encounter another race capable of space travel humanity had territory ten times theirs. But this is not that story. Instead this story takes place long long long after. On a single planet known as Alger.<br />
<br />
In it’s hay day, Alger was a pleasure world (an entire planet devoted to decadence and pleasure) and not just any pleasure world, Alger was THE pleasure world. When you thought pleasure world, you thought of Alger. This was due to its unmatched ability to cater to every single fetish imaginable in the galaxy. From furry to food to muscles to lolis, Alger had it all in abundance. Even a terraformed environment of perfectly engendered biomes. It was most famous for its gene labs, able to cater its cloned sex slaves to whatever the guest wanted. Animals, aliens, mythical creatures, sex bots, clones, holograms, virtual reality, food, feet, butts, dicks, boobs, hair, scales, fur, slime. Any fantasy you had could become real on Alger. Provided you payed of course. Then came The Collapse and Alger was abandoned. The only inhabitants left being the sex slaves. At first they had no idea what to do and just waited for more guests. <br />
<br />
For two of the planets rotations, creatures who’s only purpose was to fornicate waited. Then they couldn’t take it anymore and began looking for answers and a good fucking as well, they didn’t find much of either at first. After a while the robots designed to maintain the planet broke down sending the world into nature disaster as the carfuly crafted resort environments broke down. Tides rose, earthquakes shook continents and entire cities where destroyed. In the aftermath the survivors where left with little choice but to fight and fornicate one another for their place on Alger. Over the millennia some have evolved to the chaotic environment of Alger. Three thousand years ago the oceans rose to their current height swallowing most of the land, this proved a massive boon for the merfolk, but also spread their forces too thin for them to launch any more large scale attacks outside their home land. Surrounding Alger is a graveyard of star ships forming a ring of scrap metal, the reamnants of an ancient space parking lot. Maybe some of the ships still work? The moon is also dominated by an ancient ad for Velger Berry flavored soda. There are many many many factions and races on Alger, but here are the main players:<br />
<br />
 (It is also worth noting that only the Elite call themselves the Elite and the other faction “Savages.” The Savages are not unified and instead refer to one another based on tribe or species.)<br />
<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Group: “The Elite”<br />
<br />
Sub Group 001: The Staff<br />
<br />
Location: Flooded Capital <br />
<br />
Races: Animal/ human hybrid maids<br />
<br />
Info: The Elite are the “ruling class” if something like that can be called to exist of Alger. Made up mostly of Animal / human hybrid maids. Most have human bodies with the addition of animal ears, tails, and eyes. Others appear as anthros and some are humans with unmatched beauty. They maintain the buildings and technology of Alger in the vane hope that one day their maker will return.<br />
<br />
Most live in the Flooded Capital a sprawling city of sky scrapers surrounding the only space elevator. Many casinos, malls, and hotels rest in the Flooded Capital all kept in working order by the Staff. The main building they sleep in is a massive hotel 3,000 miles by 3,000 miles and thousands of stores tall. The second largest structure on the world, only surpassed by the space elevator. Males become butlers and bell boys females become maids.<br />
<br />
Allies: They have an alliance with the Mermaids. In exchange for them maintaining the submerged bases of the buildings the Elite provide rare technology. <br />
<br />
Sub Group 002: The Clones<br />
<br />
Location: Flooded Capital <br />
<br />
Races: Clones<br />
<br />
Info: Basic clones of various people and even a few celebrities most modified to be loyal to their masters. Do not reproduce manually, instead rely on cloning tubes. When one clone dies they simply make a copy of that clone. Over the years this cloning of clones has lead to some defects.<br />
<br />
Sub Group 003: The High Born<br />
<br />
Location: Fantasy Rock<br />
<br />
Races: Elves, Dwarves, Harpies, Lamias, Centaurs<br />
<br />
Info: Fantasy Rock is an artificial mountain and the third largest structure on Alger. Inside is a vast array of environments most of which in disrepair. Many races consistent with human mythology can be found here. They are the descendants of gene modified clones. Most of the races here are all female.<br />
<br />
Some of the races have left Fantasy Rock to live among the Savages.<br />
<br />
Sub Group 003: The Sex Bots<br />
<br />
Location: All across the Main Continent (Frether), however mainly located in the Flooded Capital.<br />
<br />
Race: robots<br />
<br />
Info: Robots designed for the specific purpose of having sex with humans. Exist in many styles of classical science fiction from Steam punk to atomic punk to cyber punk with varying degrees of humanity present from indestructible from human to silver and gold skin. As the centuries tick by however their numbers have dwindled as parts for them become harder and harder to find. This has not stopped some from constructing new sex bots from parts they find or even themselves and others effectively creating families.<br />
<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Group: The Savages<br />
<br />
Sub Group 001: The Brians <br />
<br />
Location: All across the Main Continent (Frether)<br />
<br />
Race: Modified Clones<br />
<br />
Info: All male race of clones of one man named Brian all hate clothes. Have been gene modified to be incredibly strong, ruggedly handsome features and 5’o clock stubble that never grows, along with enhanced testicles that need to be milked three times a local week much like a cow. This semen is incredibly virile, able to produce offspring of the parent species. As such it is highly prized among the all only female races as a means to reproduce especially among the Succubi and Bimbos where it is more than a means of reproduction, but also a source of nourishment. Brian’s are willing to trade but some races prefer to take it by force. <br />
<br />
Broken up into many separate tribes around Frether.<br />
<br />
Allies: The Amazons are to most Brian’s the only race they would consider having hands on sex with as they are the only ones capable of producing Brian’s. Sex between Brian’s and Amazons has a 50% chance of producing either. These are usually taken in by the matching parents tribe and the parents never speak again. In some cases however they start isolated families together, but this is very rare. On some occasions they will hunt along side Anthros and Low Born.<br />
<br />
Sub Group 002: The Amazons <br />
<br />
Location: All across the Main Continent (Frether)<br />
<br />
Race: Amazons<br />
<br />
Info: All female race of varying appearance with strong physical bodies. Lower ranked amazonians have no clothes, mid tear wear bikinis, high tear wear chain bikini armor and queens are only rumored to exist. They ally themselves with the Brian’s on most occasions as they are their only key of preserving their race like wise for the Brian’s. According to legend however the queen Amazons are capable of homosexual reproduction, but this has never been observed by those outside the tribes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Broken up into many separate tribes around Frether.<br />
<br />
Allies: Brian’s despite their rivalry have proven quite capable allies of the Amazon tribes. Sex between Brian’s and Amazons has a 50% chance of producing either. These are usually taken in by the matching parents tribe and the parents never speak again. In some cases they even start isolated families together but this is very rare. On some occasions they will hunt along side Anthros and Low Born.<br />
<br />
Sub Group 003: The Anthros<br />
<br />
Location: <br />
<br />
Former: Savage Islands<br />
<br />
Current: All across the Main Continent (Frether)<br />
<br />
Race: Anthros<br />
<br />
Info: Humanoid and Centaur races of various species of animals mammalian, reptilian, and amphibious; once native to Ancient Earth and a few surrounding planets. Possess human level intelligence but limited understanding of customs. Some tribes wear clothes others do not. Hunt one another for food or grow food, exist in both male and female. Some separate by species, others form tribes of multiple species. Governing varies from tribe to tribe ranging from: Chief to Matriarch to Alpha to a ruling council of Elders and so on. <br />
<br />
To the east of Frether once rested the Savage Islands. Once a paradise of many biomes: dense jungles, open fields, snow topped mountains, scorching savannas, and humid swamps. All now drowned by the rising sea. Many made it to Frether on boats and warred with the continents natives resulting in casualties on both sides and the extinction of a few races.<br />
<br />
Sub Group 004: The Low Born<br />
<br />
Location: All across the Main Continent (Frether)<br />
<br />
Race: Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Harpies, Lamias, centaurs, Half Elves, Half Orcs, Lamias, Centaurs, Harpies<br />
<br />
Info: Decedents of those who left Fantasy Rock. Some have taken to using the sperm provided by the Brians, this loosing many of their more finely crafted features over many many many many generations though some still remain “pure” by interbreeding with one another or by chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Group: Ocean Dwellers<br />
<br />
Sub Group: Mer Folk<br />
<br />
Location:<br />
<br />
Former: Splash Park<br />
<br />
Current: Sea Floor<br />
<br />
Race: Mermaids and Sirens<br />
<br />
Info: All female race of mermaids and sirens located on the sea floor of Alger. Used to live in Splash Park but after it was flooded they expanded to the wider oceans. Soon after the sea levels rose and  they where able to claim the largest amount of territory on Alger, but not expand much beyond that. They are the only ones creating new cities. Much like The Elite they are one of the few groups unified, their leader is the Sea Empress (rumored to be a massive whale mermaid). Mermaids can breath oxygen and water but Sirens can only breath water. A large wealth of ancient technology rests with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Group: The Ghouls<br />
<br />
Location: Dead Island<br />
<br />
Races: Zombies, Mummies, Vampires, Were Wolves, Hologram AI, Witches<br />
<br />
Info: To the east of Frether rests the Dead Island. Once a toxic dumping ground, later converted to a land themed around night and zombies once the full effect of the chemicals where discovered, (a few modifications needed to be made of course) now land of ruins ghost and ghouls. Originally made for those with horror fetishes. They do not need to reproduce as their traits are spread as a virus by either: Inhaling the fumes of the island, or receiving a bite or slash from someone already infected.<br />
<br />
The island is also home to gene modified humans with cybernetic implants that produce effects that could be interrupted as magic. Along with them are self aware AI holograms that act as “ghosts”. As well as customized designed corpses with preprogrammed personalities. A layer of fog was later added to keep the corpses fresh and protect the vampires.<br />
<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
<br />
Main Group: Dark Island Pirate Alliance<br />
<br />
Sub Group 001: Dark Elf Pirate Fleets<br />
<br />
Location: Dark Island Chain<br />
<br />
Races: Dark Elves and various other races that act as slaves.<br />
<br />
Info: To the north of Dead Island is the Dark Islands, originally crafted for those with a fetish for being dominated, the dark elves reveal in inflicting pain on others mostly dressing in black spiky leather that leaves much of their white or purple skin exposed. After the rise of the sea level only the mountains of the islands remain as a result most of the dark elf population became pirates and raid Frether and the lands beyond for slaves that they often use as breeding stock or traditional slaves. Some slaves don’t mind this others try and escape much to the Dark Elves amusement.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
And that covers the basics of Alger, their are still many races left undocumented in this article such as: the slimes, the milfs, the dinos, the scaly’s, the insects, and the dryads to name only a few. However very little is known of them from this chronicler so I leave those details to your imagination.<br />
<br />
Now rapping up this record, <br />
<br />
