<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While things were being taken care of at the Anderson household, other matters were being addressed at the Moon Lake Hospital.<br />
Jenny Harper had been given her first were-vixen birth control pill and then a good hearty meal, considering the fact that she had not eaten since sometime Saturday night, coupled with the fact that very soon, food would be the last thing on her mind that night.<br />
Although there was still some daylight left, she could see the sun starting to set through the window of her hospital room, and already felt the early stirrings of longing from the were-vixen now within her.<br />
Ms. Tachibana promised things would be better once her induction into were society had been completed, but that certainly didn&#39;t do much to ease the conflicting thoughts entering her troubled mind right now.<br />
Having wild, hot, passionate sex with Yvette, the rogue were-vixen who made her what she was now.<br />
Making sweet, romantic love with Harry Jenkins, the first man she had ever truly fallen for, considering her strict upbringing in Alabama.<br />
Yvette and her licking each other&#39;s furry muffs until they screamed out the throes of their pleasure for all the world to hear.<br />
Settling down with Harry in the proverbial &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; Jenny hoped was in their future, and raising their kits together as a loving family.<br />
Such a swirling storm of conflicting thoughts raged in her mind until a nurse knocked on the door to her hospital room and said, &quot;It&#39;s time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse and a hospital orderly escorted Jenny toward the hospital&#39;s safe room. She couldn&#39;t figure out why one smelled like a cat and the other a pig, not knowing she was presently in the company of a weretigress and a wereboar.<br />
<i>I guess detecting unique smells is just something else I&#39;ll have to get used too,</i> she realized, as they rounded the final corner to approach their destination.<br />
The hospital&#39;s safe room was at the dead end of one corridor for security purposes. Except for the time lock to the right of the door, and what looked like a communications panel from a sci-fi series she loved, the plain door looked like the entrance to any other room in the hospital.<br />
<i>Then why does it feel like I&#39;m being escorted to my execution?</i> thought Jenny, as she also noticed the other people standing there. One was a hospital security guard. He was big, beefy, and smelled like a bear to her (which he was in his furry form).<br />
The other people waiting by the door was Ms. Tachibana and two gentlemen she didn&#39;t know. Jenny was getting quite accustomed to the smell of werefoxes, but was severely disappointed that there was no sign of Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Konichiwa,&quot; said Akane, bowing slightly before her. &quot;While I knew you had chosen to be here tonight,&quot; she said, nodding toward the door to the safe room, &quot;you never announced a decision as to whether or not you would prefer to have company with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Company?&quot; repeated Jenny, staring at the other two werefoxes. Even in their human forms, they were both quite handsome. Taller than the Skulk leader and well toned.<br />
&quot;I have been informed that the dishonorable rogue who has brought such shame and grief to our clan has been captured.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great news,&quot; said Jenny, with the first genuine smile she expressed since this whole situation started. But when Ms. Tachibana continued to stare at her, she said, &quot;Yet I sense there&#39;s something more you need to say.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sad, but true,&quot; admitted Akane. &quot;Due to circumstances beyond our control, Yvette will be unable to complete your transformation until after her arraignment hearing tomorrow morning, when proper arrangements can be made to insure that she will do what is right by you without attempting to escape again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tomorrow?&quot; Jenny repeated, wanting to scream, but instead, tried to calmly ask, &quot;And these gentlemen...?&quot;<br />
&quot;Both are already werefoxes who are willing to volunteer to keep you... company during the night. With the days starting to grow short with the coming winter, there will be almost a full 13 hours to pass between dusk and dawn tomorrow morning, since I have been informed there is only a king sized bed and a small bathroom within that windowless chamber. There will be no risk of forming a life/mate bond with either or both of them, but at least their presence should make the night a little... less stressful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary!&quot; shouted a voice, as Jenny turned to see Harry running toward her. He was carrying a couple of plastic bags full of stuff. One obviously hastily packed, since she spotted the edge to one of her favorite t-shirts sticking out of it.<br />
&quot;Harry!&quot; said Jenny, wanting to run into his arms, but the orderly stood between them.<br />
&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late honey, but I&#39;m here now. In more ways than one,&quot; said Harry, as he moved all the plastic bags to one hand to use his now free hand to grab hers. &quot;I promised you I&#39;d be by your side to help you in any way I can, and I meant that. It will be bad enough when you have to spend time with that bitch who started this mess to make you whole again, but to spend time with a total stranger?&quot; he asked, while looking at the two men with Akane.<br />
&quot;Ms. Tachibana means well,&quot; continued Harry, &quot;but I love you too much to see you suffer anymore. And back in the tent, when at first I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on and feared I might lose you...&quot; Then Harry got down on one knee before everyone present and asked, &quot;Jennifer Harper, can I please have your hand and paw in marriage?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny started crying tears of joy as she pulled Harry back up and into her arms. &quot;Oh you beautiful man, <b>YES!</b>&quot; she shouted for all to hear, perhaps a little more enthusiastic (and orgasmic?) than it needed to be.<br />
&quot;That is all very well and good, but you are aware of what will happen if you do spend the night with her?&quot; asked Akane pointedly.<br />
&quot;If not now, definitely on our honeymoon,&quot; replied Harry, as he kissed his new fiance.<br />
&quot;Are you <i>absolutely</i> sure about this?&quot; asked Jenny, as she broke the kiss. &quot;I&#39;ve told you how strict my parents were growing up. They don&#39;t even know I lost my virginity to you, let alone that we&#39;ve had pre-marital sex. It will be quite a shock to them to discover I&#39;m engaged, let alone that I&#39;ve decided to spend the rest of my life here in Moon Lake, instead of moving back to Alabama after I graduate like they want me to.&quot;<br />
&quot;When did you decide that?&quot; asked Ms. Tachibana.<br />
&quot;When the man I love got down on one knee and proposed,&quot; replied Jenny, before kissing Harry again.<br />
<i>I wish it was under better circumstances, but at least everything should work out for all concerned, though her parents might become an issue in the future,</i> thought Akane. <i>Yet, while being with the one she truly loves and is bonding to will help, the longer Jenny Harper is incomplete...</i><br />
The thought went unfinished as her cellphone began to ring.<br />
Akane looked at the Caller ID and saw it was Daisuke, who was calling again to ask her Samantha Twist&#39;s question. The Skulk leader answered her phone long enough to say &quot;Please hold,&quot; and then turned to the two lovers. <br />
&quot;I wish you both the very best, and we will have much to talk about when clearer heads prevail in the morning. But for now,&quot; she said, before bowing in a sweeping arch, as if she had escorted them to the safe room.<br />
&quot;Come Mister Jenkins,&quot; said Jenny, grabbing his hand and running to the safe room.<br />
&quot;Yes Mrs. Jenkins to be,&quot; replied Harry happily, as he closed the door behind them.<br />
The automatic lock clicked shut, as the timer confirmed it would not open until dawn tomorrow.</p>
