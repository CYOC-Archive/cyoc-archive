<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam was going to tell Milo what he had in mind, but an idea came to mind right as he was about to open his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Actually, never mind, I got a better idea,” Sam responded. “Don’t want to make you or anyone else too uncomfortable. But enough about that! What were you thinking of having me do?”<br />
<br />
Milo was a bit curious as to why Sam had changed his mind so suddenly, but he did appreciate Sam’s respect for everyone else in the room, even if it meant he couldn’t show off for Todd.<br />
<br />
“Okay, uh…what all has changed for you?” Milo asked. “I’ll have a better idea of what angles would be best if I know exactly what’s changed.”<br />
<br />
“Tail, ears, hair, the fur on my neck, and…uh…down there…”<br />
<br />
“Oh okay, that’s not bad at all. I think I might have you pose similarly to how Dare did a minute ago: back to the camera and looking over your shoulder. I can get another picture of your front so we get all your changes. Sounds good to you?”<br />
<br />
Sam took a second to process everything that Milo said before nodding in agreement. “Yeah, yeah! I like that!” he said, moving in front of the camera. He took off his shirt and pants with relative ease, but found himself hesitating when he got to his boxers. He’d been in his underwear in front of other guys, but he’d never stripped in front of anyone before. <br />
<br />
<i>”Have to document every change…”</i> Sam thought to himself. He took a deep breath and pulled off his boxers, revealing his furry sheath. Todd’s eyes widened as he caught a quick glimpse of the soon-to-be-tiger’s sheath and moved a little closer to Milo so he could get a better look. Upon seeing Todd move closer, Sam’s cheeks turned a bright shade of red as he looked away from the camera, scratching the back of his head. <br />
<br />
“Hold that pose!” Milo semi-shouted suddenly, which caused Curtis to jump slightly, though he was quickly calmed down by Ollie stroking his head. <br />
<br />
“Dude, there’s no need to shout,” Dare said, a hint of frustration in his voice. While he understood that Milo was passionate about his photography project, he wished that it didn’t have to be done in their dorm room.<br />
<br />
“Right…sorry,” Milo apologized. He quickly checked his camera’s settings before going behind it to begin taking pictures. “You think you can glance up at me just a little Sam?” Sam did so, and Milo adjusted the camera settings a little before starting to take some pictures. The young photographer found himself a little less inspired from taking Sam’s photos than from when he was taking photos of Dare. Sure, Sam was quite attractive, but he wasn’t giving Milo that Sam energy that Dare was giving him. Nevertheless, he was still rather anxious to see what Sam thought of the photos. <br />
<br />
After a few more photos, Milo stepped back from the camera and gave Sam a thumbs up. The jock sighed in relief before pulling his boxers back up and getting clothed again. <br />
<br />
“Okay, so I want you to tell me what you think of these,” Milo said, pulling up the pictures he had just taken on his laptop. “I know I said I’d have you do different poses, but I think the pose you did captured everything that’s changed so far rather nicely, if I do say so myself.” Sam finished putting his shirt on and walked over to where Milo was standing. He looked over the pictures before nodding in approval. <br />
<br />
“Not bad Milo! You’re pretty damn good at this!” Sam said before rustling Milo’s hair a bit. Milo blushed a little at the compliment. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Sam, I’m glad you like them,” he said. Milo proceeded to turn towards Ollie and Curtis and asked “Hey Ollie, you want to go next?”<br />
<br />
Ollie shook his head. “Nah, not just yet,” he said, petting Curtis’ head again. “I’m actually really comfy like this…” <br />
<br />
“How about you Curtis?” The dog boy shook his head, too preoccupied with Ollie to go now. That only left…<br />
<br />
Milo’s gaze shifted to Todd, who was peeking over Sam’s shoulder to look at the pictures. When he realized Milo was looking at him, Todd quickly looked away from the screen in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“You want to go Todd? You’re the only one that can go right now.”<br />
<br />
The young man shifted uncomfortably. “Um…I can try…” he said softly. Todd slowly moved in front of the camera and sheepishly began to take his shirt off, revealing his new upper body. Dare looked over, a confused look on his face. <br />
<br />
“Damn, did you always have a body like that Todd?” he asked. “You don&#39;t really strike me as the kind of guy to work out. No offense.” Todd blushed in embarrassment and shook his head. <br />
<br />
“N-No…I-I-I woke up…like th-this…” he stuttered. Todd slowly moved to begin taking off his pants, but he froze as his fingers slipped beneath the hem of his pants. “S-S-S-Sorry…”<br />
<br />
Milo noticed Todd’s hesitation and spoke up. “Hey Todd, you don’t have to do your photos nude if you haven’t had anything change down there. You can do the shoot in your boxers, does that sound okay?” Dare looked like he was about to say something about Milo not telling him that, but he held his tongue. The last thing Todd needed was to feel like Milo was making an exception due to his shyness. <br />
<br />
“Okay…I-I can do that…” Todd said quietly. He remembered what Sam did earlier and took a deep breath before pulling down his pants. Once they were fully off, he neatly set them aside. “How do you w-want me to p-pose?”<br />
<br />
Milo thought for a second before grabbing his desk chair and moving it in front of the camera. “Okay, I’m gonna have you sit down in the chair, okay?” Todd nodded before doing as he was instructed. “Okay, now lean back just a bit…put your right arm behind the back of the chair and your left hand in your lap…now just give me a little smile!”<br />
<br />
Todd gave the camera a shy smile. Milo quickly adjusted some settings before quickly snapping some pictures, messing with some settings every few seconds.<br />
<br />
“God he looks cute,” Sam said quietly to himself. He didn’t realize that Todd had overheard what he’d said until he noticed that Todd was blushing like crazy. He then noticed Ollie give Curtis a gentle nudge before pointing at Todd. Curtis looked, and his tail began wagging happily. Even Dare was smirking at something. What had their attention? It was then that Sam caught a quick glimpse of something black and furry rapidly moving behind Todd, and he understood. <br />
<br />
“Okay Todd, I’ve got my photos,” Milo said. “Sorry it took so long. Had to make a few adjustments in the middle of that due to all the movement.”<br />
<br />
Todd cocked his head to the side in confusion, which made Sam’s heart practically melt. “M-Movement? B-But I…I w-wasn’t…” His voice trailed off when he felt something brush against his back. Turning his head, Todd finally noticed what Milo was talking about. He stood up from the chair and reached for his new tail, feeling the soft, black fur that coated it. A strange sense of pride filled him as he looked at his new appendage. <br />
<br />
He quickly put his clothes back on and moved behind the camera to stand with Sam. He was quiet for a second before he softly asked “You think I’m cute?” Sam blushed, his face a deep shade of red. <br />
<br />
“Very…”</p>
