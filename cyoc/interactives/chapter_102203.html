<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam decided to let Gene in.  Regardless of what happened to him, he knew Gene was his friend and would help him.  Sam grabbed a shirt to cover his developing breasts, and ran to the door.  He noted that he didn&#39;t have any bras in his room, nor any female undergarments.<br />
<br />
I guess reality hasn&#39;t changed too much, Sam thought.  At least not yet.<br />
<br />
Sam opened the door and looked at Gene.  They were both about the same height. At least the hormones weren&#39;t shrinking him.  He guessed that he would need magic to do that.  Gene eyed him strangely, but carefully looking him up and down.<br />
<br />
Finally, Gene spoke.  &quot;Well, are you going to let me in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure, come in,&quot; said Sam, as he moved out of the way.  He noticed that his voice sounded different.  A little higher, but still androgynous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man, what happened yesterday?  You just ditched me at the magic shop and just left,&quot; said Gene, as he plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV.<br />
<br />
Sam sighed a little.  Gene still thought of him as a guy. At least in this reality they weren&#39;t dating or anything else that would make their relationship uncomfortable. But he did wonder how Gene would react when he told him what had happened.  Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t think Sam was crazy.<br />
<br />
Sam walked over to Gene, and stood in front of him while he sat on the couch.  His hips were wider, pinching his shorts just a little.  He swayed a little as he walked.  He noted that the hairs on his legs seemed softer, less prominent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Notice anything different about me?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
Gene arched an eyebrow, examining  him closely.  He sighed.  &quot;The truth, dude?  Well, I didn&#39;t want to say anything, but you look a little girly.  I mean, if you are gay or something that is fine with me.  I am pretty open-minded.  But just so you know, I am not interested.  I mean, we can still be friends, but I don&#39;t swing that way, &quot; said Gene. <br />
<br />
Sam pouted and stamped his petite foot.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gay! It&#39;s more complicated than that, &quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam frowned.  This was going to be hard to explain.  But he was comforted by the fact that Gene was still going to be his friend, and that he was not attracted to him.  He sighed.  He might as well just tell him the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know this is going to sound weird, but it&#39;s true.  I was messing with a weird keychain flashlight that I bought from that magic store and it changed my genitalia from male to female,&quot; said Sam quickly.<br />
<br />
Gene looked at him with shock.  &quot;Bullshit, &quot; he said softly.<br />
<br />
Sam sighed.  &quot;See for yourself, &quot; said Sam, as he pulled down his pants and revealed his smooth vagina.<br />
<br />
Gene stared, his mouth agape.  He quickly snapped it shut. &quot;That&#39;s just some prosthetic.  You are just messing with me, &quot; said Gene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I lie about something like this!&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  Why would you try to look like a girl?  Maybe you are just a weird dude,&quot; said Gene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what can I do to prove it?&quot; said Sam angrily.<br />
<br />
Gene seemed lost in thought, then suddenly smiled.  &quot;Can I touch it?&quot; asked Gene slyly.<br />
<br />
Sam shuddered a bit.  He hadn&#39;t really even explored it himself.  The thought of having his friend feel him made him feel odd.  But what choice did he have?<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; said Sam, as he thrust his groin forward.<br />
<br />
Gene slowly reached forward, eying Sam&#39;s face with suspicion.  He still thought this was some kind of trick.  He first touched the flesh around his vagina.  It felt warm and soft, with no hint of plastic.  He slowly moved his finger&#39;s towards Sam&#39;s vagina.  He touched the clit, and Sam jumped a bit.  Sam was surprised at how sensitive it was.  This seemed to encourage Gene.  He looked more intently at Sam&#39;s vagina, seeing it in a new light.  He began to work his fingers inside, gently probing and thrusting.  Sam felt himself getting excited in spite of his embarrassment.  His vagina began to get wet, lubricating itself.  Finally, Sam could take it no more, and slapped Gene&#39;s hand away.  He pulled up his shorts, flushing with embarrassment.  Gene smelled his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s real,&quot; he said with shock.  &quot;You weren&#39;t lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you believe me now?&quot; Sam said, as he crossed his arms.  His small developing breast nubs popped up a bit, bulging in his shirt a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, &quot; said Gene softly.  &quot;But, why are you still like that?  Do you want to be a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; said Sam quickly.  &quot;But I dropped the flashlight in the toilet, and it stopped working.  I was hoping maybe you could fix it so I could return to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam tossed the flashlight to Gene, and he examined it carefully.  Sam explained how it worked, and Gene listened thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I don&#39;t know if I can fix it here.  At least not without my tools.  And I know a guy who is better with this kind of stuff than me.  Can I take it with me and bring it back when I&#39;m finished repairing it?&quot; asked Gene.<br />
<br />
Sam thought about it.  Gene was pretty good with electronics, but he was worried about losing the flashlight.  What if he never returned or lost it?  That flashlight was his only hope of becoming male again.  Maybe he should just try to fix it himself.  Or maybe he could make Gene get his tools and come back here.  Then again, maybe he should just go back to the magic shop and ask for help.  Sam considered his options.</p>
