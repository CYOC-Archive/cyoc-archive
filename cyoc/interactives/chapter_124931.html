<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Excellent,&quot; Madame Illusia said loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephen dear boy, what do we have backstage, something equine, some male animal,&quot; Madame asked her protoge&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Auntie Illusia, there is from last week&#39;s Tuesday show a Percheron stallion backstage!&quot; Stephen announced aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring out the stallion,&quot; Madame said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, please stand very still, and as Stephen brings out your new home, I shall begin to make you as compatible with the stallion.<br />
<br />
Kneel, oh and you need not remove your clothing, this trick is easier than most people could understand. Now, repeat after me, I tom wish to be, something black, something bold, leaving me my eyes and mouth, a brain to merge with that of a lovely horse..., Oh yes, here comes Andy, he is a black Percheron stallion.&quot; Madame said, as Stephen walked the obviously nervous horse onto the stage.<br />
<br />
Stephen walked the tall horse to come as stand almost over where Tom was kneeling.<br />
<br />
The stallion was becoming as aroused, his great as all black horse cock unfurling out the black sheath, it bloating, lengthening, becoming a giant male tool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Behold there Tom, the new you, your permanent home, away from all human drudgery.&quot; Madame said, as the audience sounded as if nervous about what they were a witness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reach up your hands and take a firm hold of the aroused horse cock.  Yes, very good, and now lift the cock to your mouth.  Yes, that too is what is needed. Now then Tom, scooch along on your knees, to bring your mouth to envelope the blunt end to the horse cock, yes just like that!&quot; Madame directed Tom to begin what to those in the audience who were of a religious background, knew this act was on the verge of doing sodomy between a man and a stallion horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then Tom, take your tongue and with the tip, begin to tickle the cock opening!<br />
<br />
Close your eyes, think only about the cock you are holding and the cock you are tickling, as do what I say!<br />
<br />
Think in your thoughts, I want to be this, I want to be this, and beg to beg it, plead to become as merged bodily with this vibrant black male horse member..., Yes - Yes, I can hear your mind relishing the idea, yes, you do wish to become a horse&#39;s cock!<br />
<br />
Slowly now, begin to suckle the cock as if it were a nipple.<br />
<br />
Yes Tom, yes Tom, as you suckle let the cock slither more inside your mouth, as to the back of your throat, but do not gag or try to swallow.<br />
<br />
Stephen, hand me my black cape, and drape it over the back of the horse, having it to cloak down over Tom.<br />
<br />
Alakazam, and bippity zam, a swish of my left arm and a hard smack on the broad back of the stud!&quot; Madame said.  <br />
<br />
The audience watched as all they could see of Tom was his waistline and his legs. They all made a swooning sound when it seemed as if Tom was being sucked out of his shirt, it dropping to pool about his waist. They saw Tom seemingly reaching, his butt and legs moving as if he were trying to stand-upright under the large stallion.<br />
<br />
Just about then the pants, shirt, T-shirt, underwear, socks, and shoes were on stage but nowhere was Tom, he naked or otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where the hell did he go?&quot; Yelled a man from the audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, right here,&quot; Madame said, as she reached her hands to yank away her black cloak, leaving on stage a pile of discarded clothing, and a Percheron stallion sporting an erect horse cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, Tom, where are you Tom?&quot; Madame asked, as she took to looking skyward.<br />
<br />
Stephen said, &quot;Here, I heard Tom answer,&quot; as he held low his microphone to the blunt end of the horse cock.<br />
<br />
Though the sound system a faint as squeaky voice was heard by all, &quot;It is I Tom, I am in here!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is here, we cannot see you Tom?&quot; Madame asked as she began to look around the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give us a clue to where you are,&quot; Madame asked of Tom?<br />
<br />
The whole audience jumped or jerked in their seats when the erect horse cock began to wiggle, it rising, rose high as if the stallion were to begin a pattern of equine style masturbating. The cock held up as straight out, facing that blunt end as forward. It took to swaying side to side, never once touching the rounded furred belly of the stallion.<br />
<br />
As then the horse&#39;s tail began to rise, it got swished, was swishing faster, while the cock mouth spit droplets of clear pre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Holy God no, no, oh Tom, oh no, he really has become the horse&#39;s cock!&quot; A woman in the audience said, she seated to where Tom had sat before he came up on the stage.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, and with a shock to the audience the stallion ejaculated, his semen shot out from the cock mouth, streaking some four feet as it plaster his fore-legs, and went further to make a puddle of creamy semen there on the stage floor.<br />
<br />
One ejaculated stream of horse semen was shot forward, as then came a second, a third, and with the forth it dwindling, had not the thrust as it dribbled out the cock mouth to the stage floor directly below the tall stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Video man, bring your camera closer, as pointing it along the cock body, moving up to where the cock adjoins the sheath, and there, yes there, can all see, as now part of the horse scrotum are two eyes, blue eyes, those of Tom, as he is fully merged with the genitals of this Percheron stallion!&quot; Madame announced, as the people in her audience all swoon or cry.<br />
<br />
On the overhead monitors everybody of the audience can see the two blinking eyes, and as the camera trailed along the pulsing cock body, when aimed at the mouth to the cock, the small lips were moving, as if the cock were speaking.<br />
<br />
Stephen leaned forward and brought his hand held microphone close to the cock blunt face. The audio system turned up the gain and all heard Tom crying, he pleading, saying that he had become the cock for the horse above him. Just then a second ejaculation begins, this not as strong and had but two bursts of semen jetting out the cock mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck, yuck, the salty taste of his semen is still nasty!&quot; Tom speaking as his voice announced to the audience as of how he seemed to dislike where Madame put him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, you are especially useful to your stallion host, as he seeing what your two eyes can see, he can aim his cock body all the better. Just you wait..., huh of course you need to wait, as from today you cannot leave where you are, as being a horse cock!<br />
<br />
Hear me and know this, that after the show finishes, Stephen will lead your stallion host to Jeb Flycatcher&#39;s donkey stables, and there in a corral you can see up close and personal, what it feels being a stallion&#39;s cock, as he mates, has sex with recently reformated jennet donkeys; their hot cunnies are eager and waiting!&quot; Madame announced for all to hear.<br />
<br />
Just then the stallion cut loose a loud whinny, as if he too wanted to go to meet Jeb and gain carnal sensations from mating with hot body jennet donkeys.<br />
<br />
The audience broke into a massive round of applause as the curtain fell on stage and this horrific show came to a close.</p>
