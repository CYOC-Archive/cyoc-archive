<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 8:00 sharp the next morning when the dog trainer knocked on Tony&#39;s door. The loud noise startled Tony so thoroughly that he lurched completely out of his bed and tumbled down into his floor. He heard the unlocked door of his bedroom starting to creak open, realized his man bits were hanging out, and so he yelped and reached down between his legs to cover them. Then he heard his name tag jingle and remembered exactly where he was and why he was exposed. He breathed out a sigh of relief, and when the door finished opening he was stumbling to his feet to see who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, David, good morning!&quot; Tony greeted in recognition, wagging his little nub without a second thought this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, buddy, told you we&#39;d have to start training early. Is my new champ ready to go out and get started?&quot; David asked rhetorically. Tony realized that he had actually slept in very late, and what David called &quot;early&quot; was at least three hours after Tony would normally have to leave his old apartment to go and work for minimum wage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really did make the right decision!&quot; Tony thought to himself silently and then jumped up to follow David. David patted him on the back, making Tony even more excited for whatever his new friend had planned for a human-turning-into-a-dog on a sunny morning like this. David paused briefly in front of the communal baths and asked Tony if he wanted to visit the human restroom before they made their way out into the training yard. Tony thought back to how disappointing the urinal experience had been the night before and enthusiastically told David that he was ready to do what dogs do and do it outside! Tony was even actually proud of that declaration at first, but you could have painted an orchard of apples with the shade of red Tony&#39;s face turned with David reached into to a nearby closed and pulled out a pooper scooper. That was when it hit Tony like a ton of bricks that for the rest of their training together, his old elementary school classmate was going to be cleaning up after him. If his tail had been longer, it would have been between his legs when he followed David out into the open terrain. &quot;Oh well, time to make the best of it,&quot; Tony thought.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the first order of business was for Tony to actually do his business. That way, he could start getting into a routine, and they wouldn&#39;t have to worry about interrupting their training as much once they got started. The first part of it was relatively easy for Tony. He was much less reluctant than he had been with the Bedlow lady. In fact, he practically ran over to the tree he&#39;d peed on the day before, and then the most unexpected thing happened (to Tony at least): he started to sniff it. At first he was confused by his desire to do this and didn&#39;t even have the faintest idea what he was sniffing for, and then he found it: it was his dried piss from yesterday! It shouldn&#39;t have been nearly as interesting as it was. But he could smell other things too--but mainly more piss as it turned out. It smelled like it had come from several other people (animals?) at different times going back to before he arrived at Illusia Kennels. And was that--yes, he could smell Megan! Tony wasn&#39;t sure how he could really know it was Megan, but one of the scents on the tree just seemed like it was probably from her. After he&#39;d had his fill of discovering all the scents he could find there, Tony stood up and set off his waterworks without even a thought to the other man standing next to him. When he was finished, his tiny tail wagged with pride at the notion that Megan might eventually notice he&#39;d peed there. Of course, he quickly found himself thinking that was a rather silly idea to get excited about, but he couldn&#39;t deny that it had put him in a better mood nevertheless.<br />
<br />
That was only a small comfort for the next task he knew he had to complete, because it was going to leave a much more obvious byproduct behind, and it was human being beside him was actually going to have to interact with. Tony knew it was unavoidable, though, because he hadn&#39;t done number two since the spell was cast on him, he wasn&#39;t going to be able to hold out much longer, and he&#39;d already made a big show of having adjusted to this aspect of the canine lifestyle. He milled around the training yard nervously for a few minutes and even ended up asking David for advice on the best place to deposit it at. David simply shrugged his shoulders and told Tony that as long as he was doing it outside it didn&#39;t make a difference to him where he did it. Tony looked away in shame. David hadn&#39;t been even the slightest bit mean about it, but it was still humiliating. Nevertheless, it was also rather liberating: now that he&#39;d officially given up the way humans do this, he was finally free to do it the way dogs do it, and that meant he could just go ahead and finally get it over with. <br />
<br />
Tony milled around a little more to build his courage up and find a spot that somehow seemed right to him. He carefully avoid making eye contact even with his nonjudgmental trainer as he slowly squatted down. He almost couldn&#39;t do it. It was even worse than being like a baby or a toddler again! At least a baby would have a diaper on so it&#39;s parents could dispose of it in the privacy of somewhere else. After Tony did this, he would truly be no better than an animal in this regard. But an animal is what he&#39;d signed up to be, so Tony opened his bowels and let the waste slide out of him. After it was completely out, he started kicking himself mentally for actually going through with it. But immediately, a bunch of new scents seemed to find his nose. They were stimulating, they were tantalizing, and they were coming from behind him. He turned to look at the brown object that had emerged from within him. He knew how disgusting it was, and how he should have simply left it in the toilet inside, but he also knew that the scents were coming from it, and he couldn&#39;t pass up his only chance to examine the object a little closer. He sent his nostrils down a little closer, and he was almost overwhelmed by the sheer encyclopedia of information that he got from it! He could smell chicken in it. He could smell yesterday&#39;s breakfast in it. It was so appetizing he would have eaten it if he didn&#39;t know what it was! He could smell last nights arousal in it. And he could smell some sort of sickness in it: probably that cancer the doctor was talking about, although he knew he wouldn&#39;t have that much longer. And most importantly, this object was his. Tony could unmistakably recognize it as his, and would have recognized as his anywhere, even if he hadn&#39;t just made it.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when David reached down with his tool and picked it up. Tony&#39;s excretion went unceremoniously down into a trash can, and that was that. David didn&#39;t even seem fazed by having cleaned up the feces of a fellow human, because in David&#39;s mind, he hadn&#39;t. Tony was a dog now, or at least he might as well be. Humans were responsible for every aspect of his life from now on: what he did, what went into him, and even what came out of him. And no matter how little he&#39;d transformed so far, Tony truly was one of those humans no longer, nor would he ever be of them again.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, boy, how about we get your exercise routine started. Want me to start you off with a game of fetch?&quot; David asked in that excited, playful voice of his. And Tony did the only reasonable thing he could do after what he&#39;d just done. He watched the ball and ran after it and played a fast-paced game of fetch with David!</p>
