<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Violence is mentioned. But none is depticted</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dymixious was busy skinning and gutting the 10 point buck when he received a phone call. Checking the caller I.D he sees that it is his father calling.<br />
“What is the assignment this time?” Dymixious answers rather tersely. “Am I to move in on the rogue were that terrorized moon Lake?”<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause on the other line.<br />
“First off, don’t take that tone with me son.” Drake answers coldly. “Second, the rogue were Yvette is off limits. Tachibana and the Skulk have dealt with her, in their own unique way. We will not interfere as per our treaty with them and Moon Lake.”<br />
While the dragon clan did protect weres the world over. Being a small clan limits their reach to a degree. Having agreements (ancient they may be) has helped greatly in maintaining were maintain their secret from the world in all forms of the media.<br />
<br />
“Then why are you calling me father? I though this line was for were matters only.” Dymixious responds.<br />
“This is a were matter, son. I have arraigned a doctor’s appointment with you and your wife at moon lake hospital.” Drake continues. “Before you interrupt me with your usual; ‘the dragon clan has remained in the shadows for centuries. To reveal ourselves, even to other weres goes against tradition, blah blah blah’. Times have changed son.”<br />
“The clan is still strong father.” Dymixious responds proudly. “Don’t we have our own doctors to deal with the health and wellness of our kind?”<br />
<br />
“We are strong because of the treaties that have stood the test of time, son.” Drake calmly responds. “The treaty with the skulk has stood strong for a thousand years now. The fact that Tachibana the current skulk leader still abides by it shows the testament of that strength. Despite the fact that she disapproves of our actions of late.” Drake continues. “Her daughter is a doctor at moon lake hospital and will be expecting you and Jade promptly tomorrow at noon. She specializes in the health and wellness of all weres in general.”<br />
<br />
“Has she dealt with reptilian weres?” Dymixious questions.<br />
“No. Nor does she know of our kind. But by now Tachibana is briefing her on what to expect.” Drake continues. “So be on your best behavior tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Drake then disconnects the line, leaving his son with his own thoughts. Dymixious finishes up with the buck, slices off a couple of pieces to dinner and stores the rest in a freezer.<br />
<br />

<br />
Tachibana was meditating in a zen garden. She was contemplating the call she had with the head of the dragon clan when her daughter Doctor Tora arrived.<br />
“Mother you wanted to see me?”<br />
Tachibana doesn’t respond at first. She rises from her sitting position and beckons her daughter to follow her. Tachibana heads to a nearby table with chairs. There is a pot of tea with cream and sugar already placed as well as an assortment of old scrolls. Sitting down Tachibana pours tea in both cups and offers one to her daughter.<br />
“Before I ask you of this favor, I must tell you a story of how the skulk became the defacto leaders/protectors of Moon Lake.” Tachibana pauses briefly to sip her tea before continuing. “Centuries ago, Moon Lake was founded by an ancient clan. This clan was different than most were species. While a majority of the weres are mammalian (with exception of the mere species), this clan was a reptilian were species. The only reptile were species that is ‘known’ of. They called themselves the Dragon clan. Primarily their were strain is based off of the Komodo Dragon.”<br />
<br />
Tachibana continues. “They helped planned the town as it is today as well as created the pamphlet that non weres are given as they move to our town. The same pamphlet that is in a serious need of an update. At the time the Dragon clan was very powerful. They had their influence the world over. If they wanted to, they could topple governments, replace leaders, control/change elections. But they knew such power was fraught with danger. So they chose to provide guidance and observe from the shadows.”<br />
<br />
“The residents of Moon Lake at the time knew only of rumors of the dragon clan. Some even thought of them as a secret society of weres. No one knew and the Dragons encouraged this. But they could not remain in the shadows forever. Prior to the first world war. A conflict they could not stop no matter how much they tried. The dragon clan reached out to your father. The leader of the skulk at the time. With lengthy negotiations the dragon clan ceded control of moon lake to the skulk in an agreement that they would continue to protect the town and all its residents (were or human alike). In return the Dragon clan was permitted to act as the unseen hand that protected weres residing outside of moon lake.”<br />
<br />
Doctor Tora tried to raise a question but Tachibana waves her hand for silence. “Why the dragons chose to give up a lion share of their control over were society, I’ll never know. I was not privy to those talks. But what I do know is this. The dragons are few in number. While they have great power. It is only through the help of agents in various government positions the world over. Some are weres themselves. Others are regular humans with a were in the family. No different than us. But they have had several centuries practice, where we have only had a few decades worth. ”<br />
<br />
“Why are there so few?” Tora quickly adds.<br />
<br />
“We can only theorize this. It could be that since they are a reptilian were species, they are incompatible with the rest of the were community. As well as their strain kills most non weres infected with it.” Tachibana answers.<br />
<br />
“Why are you telling me this mother?” Tora asks.<br />
<br />
“You are going to be meeting two of them tomorrow. The clan leader’s son Dymixious and his wife. Who was once human and is pregnant.” Tachibana continues. “I must stress to you, Dymixious is head strong and quite stubborn. He will no doubt be resistant to this appointment.”<br />
<br />
“So this is a medical checkup?” Tora responds sipping her tea.<br />
<br />
“Yes and no. The clan leader wants to make sure his grandchild comes into the world healthy. But he also wants our help in figuring out why their were strain does not work as effectively as the mammalian strains and to formulate a cure of sorts. You are to help in both tasks. But I want to be informed on every aspect of the research. You may maintain your doctor patient confidentiality with the couple for the time being.” With that Tachibana gets up. <br />
<br />
“Mother. You said the dragon clan was protective over maintaining secrecy and protecting  weres. How?” Tora asks.<br />
<br />
Tachibana looks at Tora with a sad look. “They had Lionel Ulysses killed. Shortly after he got arrested in that raid in Seattle. You will not share that with anyone. As much as it sadness me that the kid is dead. They felt it was necessary to maintain our secret.” With that Tachibana picks up the scrolls on the table and leaves the Zen garden.</p>
