<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, Genie, I always wished I was a vampire,&quot; says Nate, eyes lit with enthusiasm.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said the genie with raised eyebrows.<br />
&quot;Yes! A vampire is rich, lives in a castle, is eternally young and gather women around him like a hot babe magnet,&quot; answered Nate. &quot;They are amazing creatures. So that is what I want to be. A vampire. I wish to be a vampire!&quot;<br />
Alibaba rubbed his chin, as if in deep thought. But in fact, he was already considering how to trick the man. The solution came to him. The perfect one, as he&#39;d be rid of Nate for good in one swoop.<br />
&quot;As you wish,&quot; Alibaba said with a small swift bow.<br />
Nate still smiled as the magic sent him to his new life.<br />
<br />
The first thing Nate was aware of as he opened his eyes was the sound of someone playing the piano. Then of people chattering happily, but clearly not too loud. He opened his eyes fully and was greeted by a ceiling of stone and wood, very far upwards. There were also pieces of cloth at the edge of his vision. What was that? Where was he? He tried to move but could not. As if his limbs and neck weighed a ton. He could only move his limbs in slight jerks. He felt very comfy, though. His blankets and pyjamas, his entire bed, in fact, was so soft and warm! Worthy of the best hotels, surely! But... But why did his bed have such high walls? Was he... Was he in a coffin? Yes, that must be it! He was a vampire now so it made sense! But... If only he could rise and get a better look at his surroundings... And also, he noticed something right over his head. It was dangling. It was... Little figures of black bats?... How strange... But what could it...?<br />
Just then, Nate jumped as a face loomed above him. The face of a woman. Young, with waves upon waves of curly hair and the reddest full lips he had ever seen. But this face... It was too big! Completely out of proportion! However, Nate did hope that she was one of his brides because she looked like a great squeeze.<br />
&quot;Is the little sweetie pie awake already?&quot; she said in a juvenile tone of voice and a wide smile.<br />
She then reached out with hands so big that they held Nate around the torso. This woman had the fangs of a vampire but she was a giant! How could it be? And this woman held him effortlessly, bouncing him against her chest. Her chest which was rather ample. More than ample, even! Oh, it was heaven to be against those boobs, thought Nate. But his dream did not last long. Nate noticed that he was wearing a dress himself. Very loose, white, with lace and frills. It was not logical and very ridiculous. But the truth dawned on him when he saw his hands. Tiny. Pudgy. Folded. And it remained so in spite of his best effort to unclench them. These were the hands of an infant. Which meant... Which meant that he was a baby. He looked around himself and saw men in fancy suits and women in beautiful dresses, all sipping from crystal glasses holding a red liquid. Probably not wine. There was a roaring fire in the huge chimney and armchairs and couches. There were curtains, books, a few globes and expensive objects. Massive windows let the night and the moon show. Nate understood he had come a  frilly crib, not a coffin. The beautiful woman sat on a couch.<br />
&quot;What is the matter with Roland?&quot; said a male vampire with longish hair combed back. <br />
&quot;He woke up much earlier than usual,&quot; said the woman with a frown. &quot;But he&#39;s probably just hungry. I&#39;ll feed him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing sever, for sure,&quot; smiled indulgently and going further to converse with someone else.<br />
Hungry? Nate wasn&#39;t. And what was this name? Roland? Surely it couldn&#39;t be his. He suddenly feared a bottle to drink from but the woman tugged a bit on her dress and showed a marvellous boob to Nate. He was fascinated by the globe of flesh. So perfect! So ripe! And the aureola was already stained by the whitish liquid dripping from the nipple. Should he...? He wasn&#39;t a baby. He wanted to touch the boob, not drink from it! But the woman thrust the nipple in his mouth and just to feel the wonderful, wonderful breast around his mouth, he started gulping the drink. It wasn&#39;t that bad but Nate was soon too absorbed by pressing himself against the precious boob. His face and hands squeezed the greatest pillow of his life. But too soon, it ended and the woman said she was going to put him to bed. Everyone tickled him, kissed him and exclaimed how cute he was, complimenting even his little bonnet. The woman then took a long path across corridors and rooms in the castle until she reached a nursery snd placed Nate in a cot. She then left, impatient to return to the party and without kissing Nate good-night. Nate moved around, annoyed. He could feel a diaper around his groin.And he should not feel so full, content and comfortable! He was an adult! There were vampires all right, but why wasn&#39;t he one? It wasn&#39;t fair, to be stuck as a stupid baby in old-fashioned baby clothes! <br />
&quot;Happy with your wish?&quot;<br />
The genie had appeared above Nate&#39;s cot. He tried to talk but only gurgles came out.<br />
&quot;You must have a few questions,&quot; said Alibaba. &quot;You aren&#39;t a vampire? You never specified when. You&#39;ll be a vampire at best as a young adult. For now you are a human baby that will be raised by vampires. Vampires cannot reproduce so they adopt human children. Sometimes, they grab handsome individuals and regress them, with their memories, to make sure their children are as they desire. For them, you were a strapping late teen in a remote village, very handsome indeed and they abducted you and regressed you. You will grow up again. With new parents. Did I leave you with your memories to remain or not? Well, you&#39;ll have to find out.&quot;<br />
Nate fidgeted. No! He had two other wishes! As if he could read his thoughts, Alibaba said:<br />
&quot;Your remaining wishes? I cannot understand baby talk and you have no strength or coordination to write, so my servitude to you ends now. Your life won&#39;t be bad, not at all, all things considered.&quot;<br />
And he vanished, leaving Nate, now Roland, to uselessly fight sleep as the piano music he could still hear exercised a sort of magic upon him by forcing his eyes shut.</p>
