<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Panic surges through your transformed body as you finally understand the gravity of your situation. You look down to see Jake’s eyes widen as he takes in your new form. He seems as shocked as you are, his tongue lolling out of his muzzle as he pants heavily. His fur is black and tan, and his eyes are still the same deep brown, filled with confusion and a hint of fear. You feel your thoughts racing, trying to piece together the events that led you here. Did you fall asleep watching that weird anime again? Did you eat something funky? Wait… it was that reality altering crystal.<br />
<br />
The knot connecting the two of you feels like a tight, pulsing rubber band, and with each beat of Jake’s heart, you feel a wave of pleasure that sends shocks through your body. You try to ignore it and focus on finding a way out of this mess. The sensations are overwhelming, making it hard to think, but you know you need to get a grip. You can’t just lie here, forever stuck in this bizarre, furry prison. “Why can’t we-GRRRR- move?” You said, with canine interjections.<br />
<br />
“I think… I think we’re ARRRFF knotted together. Which means BARKBARK I think I have to release my RUFF- knot” he said with difficulty, trying to form coherent words around his new canine vocal cords. You nodded frantically, your mind racing with the implications.<br />
<br />
The room around you was a mess of clothes and random objects scattered about, hinting at a wild night you couldn’t remember. The smell of sex and fur was thick in the air, a potent reminder of your predicament. You could feel Jake’s knot swelling inside you, the pressure increasing with each passing moment. It was clear that this was not a simple dream or a trick of the light. You were truly trapped in a furry, dog-like body, with his cock deeply embedded in your pussy. “Wait you don’t mean…” you said with fear. “I’m going to have to finish HOOOUUU fucking you.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s eyes searched yours, looking for any sign of disagreement. But the truth was, the pleasure was too intense to resist. You could feel your own body responding, your new dog pussy clenching around his shaft. You nodded, your mind racing with the reality of the situation. As Jake began to thrust into you, the knot grew even larger, making it impossible for him to pull out. The sensations grew more intense, and you couldn’t help but whine with each stroke. His furry hips pushed against your plush thighs, and his claws dug into your fur as he held onto you tightly.<br />
<br />
You could feel the tension in his body building, his knot pulsing with every thrust. The feeling was indescribable, a mix of pain and pleasure that seemed to consume every part of your being. You knew he was close, and so were you. Your own body was reacting in ways you never knew were possible, your new doggy instincts taking over. You pushed back against him, meeting his every move with a desperate need to climax. The room was filled with the sounds of your panting, the slap of skin on skin, and the occasional yelp or growl.<br />
<br />
The bed beneath you creaked with the rhythm of your mating, the sheets tangling around your furry limbs. Your eyes locked onto Jake’s reflection in the mirror on the opposite wall, watching as his powerful body took over, his human mind lost in the primal instinct to breed. You felt your orgasm building, a crescendo of sensations that seemed to originate from your very core. It was a strange and alien feeling, but you couldn’t fight it. Your body was responding to his, almost as if you were two animals in heat.<br />
<br />
Jake’s eyes glazed over, and you knew he was close. His hips bucked harder, and you could feel his knot swelling even larger inside you, stretching you to the limits of what you thought you could handle. The pain was intense, but it only served to heighten the pleasure. You reached down with your paws, feeling the soft fur of your new form, and found your clit. You began to rub it frantically, the sensation sending bolts of pleasure through your body. Your whines grew louder, your breathing more erratic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, with a final, deep growl, Jake’s body tensed, and you felt his warm seed fill you up. The knot grew even larger, and you felt yourself being pushed to the edge. With one last, desperate push, you came as well, your body writhing beneath his. The pleasure was so intense it was almost painful, and you could feel your new doggy body trying to adjust to the sensation. The orgasm seemed to go on forever, until finally, the spasms subsided.<br />
<br />
For a moment, you just lay there, panting heavily, trying to catch your breath. Jake’s knot was still firmly lodged inside you, but now it wad slowly shrinking. You could feel his warmth inside you, his heart beating against your back. “What the fuck?” you panted, still trying to wrap your head around what had just happened.<br />
<br />
“I know, I know. It’s crazy, but we have to deal with it. We need to find a way to reverse this. Do you remember anything about that crystal?” he asked, his voice still gruff and animalistic.<br />
<br />
You think back to the night before, the images swirling in your mind like a foggy dream. You recall the mesmerizing glow of the crystal, the way it seemed to pulse with an unnatural energy. You nodded, trying to keep the panic at bay. “We need to get out of here and find it. Maybe we can use it to get back to our own universe”<br />
<br />
With great difficulty, Jake pulled out his now deflated knot from your body. You felt a strange mix of relief and loss, your new dog pussy still throbbing from the intense experience. You both stumbled off the bed, your legs wobbly and unused to the new weight distribution. Your fur brushed against each other as you moved, sending shivers of sensation through your bodies. Jake looked around the room, his eyes darting back and forth. “Where the hell are we?”</p>
