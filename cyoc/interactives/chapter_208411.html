<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jayden &quot;Jay&quot; Williamson entered the locker room&#39;s long corridor of shower areas after a long and hard workout. As far as he was concerned, he had to work extra hard on his body to make up for &quot;the incident&quot; that left him as he was now. And to his credit, he&#39;d been diligent enough about it that he was if not at the level he was before just slightly stronger than he was before. It was...almost like the incident hadn&#39;t even happened. Almost. While his body had returned to where he was comfortable with it being, and while he&#39;d been able to keep his hair at the crewcut length that he preferred, he just didn&#39;t get as hairy as he did before - and there were the...other things.<br />
<br />
Jay Williamson about three years ago had been a muscular if stocky young man, a regular playboy who enjoyed using his good looks, muscular form, and impressive strength to present an allure that young women by and large couldn&#39;t resist. He&#39;d had a rakish bit of stubble on his chin, and dressed largely in jeans, tight t-shirts, and a sleeveless vest... Just thinking about how things used to be made Jay let out a sigh. One speaking both of fondness and also of a sort of resignation.<br />
<br />
Even though none of the women he&#39;d slept with had been unwilling - and in fact, had been very interested in participating in the act - Jay had been the target of...well, an attack. He&#39;d thought she was just one of the women who wanted some harmless fun. They&#39;d pull out the condoms, and both would cum, and things would be cash money.<br />
<br />
But no.<br />
<br />
She launched into a furious and immensely self righteous declaration not long after the two got within Jay&#39;s flat, and she used some kind of horrible spell on him - bombarding him with sparks and strange black laces of energy expelled from her fingers. Just thinking about the way his body had contorted, the way his form had deteriorated and turned smaller, weaker... she had more or less turned him into what she supposed would &quot;teach him a lesson&quot;. She&#39;d left gloating over her triumph, and telling him she looked forward to seeing how he &quot;developed&quot; - and that &quot;any more sex for you could get interesting for your partners...&quot;<br />
<br />
When it had happened, Jay had been turned into...well. He wasn&#39;t wholly male or female any more. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d woken up to find that his body was at a precarious place between. His features significantly more androgynous - more a pretty sort of appealing than masculinely handsome, Jay had found that his chest sported a pair of breasts, his form significantly more thin and dainty. Even his hands seemed a bit smaller. His hair seemed longer, thicker, and a bit more wavy. He remembered feeling alone, shaky, like a doe caught in the headlights. He&#39;d remembered grabbing for his groin - desperate to see if everything had changed... and he&#39;d kept his cock and balls...but gained something else.<br />
<br />
When Jay looked down there, he&#39;d found, in addition to wider, more womanly hips, there was a weird effect on his balls. Pushing on them, he&#39;d found that they seemed to have become part of his new anatomy. As if becoming part of the lips of his new pussy. The word per his more nerdy old friends scientifically was &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;.<br />
<br />
What was clear through Jay&#39;s actions however was that his sex - and his body - may have changed, but his gender remained the same.<br />
<br />
And now, three years later, Jay had built back up a muscular, strong body.<br />
<br />
Sure, the structural differences were something, but it seemed the nature of his &quot;curse&quot; as it were left him physically a bit larger and stronger than most women - but still smaller and slighter than most men. He was right there in between. And he&#39;d built up a body he could still be proud of. His stomach was not the old thick but lean barreled stomach - but instead a tight, toned six pack, complimented by obliques. His arms had pumped up with muscle, and even with his hands still being a little dainty, he was proud of the seventeen and a half inch biceps he&#39;d developed so far, not to mention the tone. <br />
<br />
His back and shoulders complimented each other - a wide, strong back with broad, powerful shoulders that led directly down into his muscular triceps and biceps. His features were still effeminately constructed, but he looked more like a pretty boy now than what he&#39;d started with. Even outside the binder he got to keep his breasts looking more like a chest, Jay could tell his breasts now had a very capable amount of strength. He&#39;d almost completely restored his bench press limits...though pressing the cold metal bar against himself kind of felt odd sometimes.<br />
<br />
While his ass was more pronounced than he&#39;d like, he could get behind the muscled look of his glutes. And his thighs and quads were really looking good...<br />
<br />
Having surveyed himself after another day&#39;s hard workout, Jay finally let the large towel off of his form once he was sure he was alone back here. He always looked forward to a shower after one of his workouts. Stepping into the shower and closing the curtain behind himself, Jay turned the water on to hot and let it cascade down his body. Feeling the heat soak in and alleviate his aches and pains was...something else. In his new state, Jay was more of a moaner when things felt good - and he blushed a little as he really took in the feel of the shower.<br />
<br />
Twisting and turning, letting his breasts get cleaned off, Jay honestly was starting to feel like he might be capable of doing dating again. He didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d explain his anatomy...but he was sure enough in that he functioned that he could see himself going out with a woman. Sure, there&#39;d be questions. But he could probably explain it as a medical condition. <br />
<br />
As he ran his hands along his sensitive chest, Jay reminisced how he&#39;d wondered before how it might feel. Or even wishing he could just...enjoy a rack on demand. But he hadn&#39;t thought it might come about this way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaah...fuck. These things always wind me up.&quot; He looked down at his half hard penis, itself about an inch shorter than it&#39;d been before he&#39;d changed. Not that it was unimpressive now. He&#39;d simply gone from good to above average. Besides, having a seven incher now or not, it was really how he used it. <br />
<br />
Jay tried his best to ignore how sexually turned on he really was today. He was in the locker room after all. He needed to get the binder back on from inside his bag outside there, get dressed, and head out. Anything more was just...inviting disaster. He didn&#39;t know how any of the guys here might react if they discovered he was packing all the available sex organs. <br />
<br />
Jay found himself biting his lip as he thought about the guys he&#39;d encountered that day. Before the transformation he&#39;d never really found guys &quot;sexy&quot; before. He could appreciate someone&#39;s work they put in for the gym. And note when they looked good for it. But that wasn&#39;t really the same as having same sex attraction...right? But now, it was like Jay just noticed all the things that drew him toward glancing at these other guys...<br />
<br />
Kevin Seitohara, a Eurasian guy, was half white and half Japanese - and had some very broad shoulders, a strong back, and a core that Jay could not help himself but think of as &quot;lovely&quot;. His chest wasn&#39;t as big as some of the other guys&#39;, but he worked the tone enough to make up for it. His conditioning was definitely on point. Though his arms were another point where it seemed like he trended more toward slender than brawny - though certainly not bad looking by any means.<br />
<br />
Malcolm Deshawn was a calm and intellectual young black guy usually in the gym training for his college football athletics. Though he gave some indication that his interest in fitness went beyond just football. Hair trimmed short, he had a mostly muscular and well built form...unless one looked at his legs and butt. Charitably, one could say Malcolm needed work back there. And his legs were simply &quot;strong but shapeless&quot;, more relying on working them on the field and eating than working out.<br />
<br />
Then there was Lukas Bjorvinn, the Norwegian - a pretty face to be sure, he could probably model if he wanted to. He used his boyish, innocent looking face, together with his altogether muscular, tight and toned though not very brawny body to flirt and bring woman upon woman into his bed. And apparently, Lukas&#39; parents were generous enough and wealthy enough to subsidize their son&#39;s idle rich life style. From what he heard, they did photography work on several big movies.<br />
<br />
Jay wiped a hand through his hair and remarked at himself, &quot;Man...&quot; He palmed his erect manhood and chuckled, &quot;You sure don&#39;t want to go down, now do you? I&#39;ll look like a pervert if I walk around the locker room with a boner. But maybe...I mean. It doesn&#39;t seem like anybody&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrapping a hand around it, his other lightly teasing his pussy, Jay choked down a moan. The sensitivity and sheer responsiveness of his body was, even now, kind of a shocker to him when he wasn&#39;t expecting it. He almost couldn&#39;t even bring himself to touch the glans of his penis, the sensitivity was so severe. When he tried anyway, Jay awkwardly laughed several times as he tried to stop himself from moaning - and just as well, almost slipped and fell in place in the locker...grasping the wall as he stopped himself from teasing that feminine anatomy he possessed.<br />
<br />
He breathed, relieved...and then heard someone else. He bit his lip. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey uh, Jay, right?&quot; The voice called from down the row of showers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;re you always showering last?&quot; The voice was teasing, and obviously they didn&#39;t get why Jay did that. He was obviously not shy. He wouldn&#39;t be dressed in short shorts to the gym if he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you know, I just...like having some time to pose and flex by myself. I mean, who knows, you guys might end up lining up to get a look...&quot; Jay responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Jay...I had wanted to talk to you. About how you&#39;ve been looking lately. How good you&#39;ve been looking, specifically. I was wondering if you might be inclined for some...experimentation. Don&#39;t laugh, I mean, a lot of straight guys experiment.&quot; Jay&#39;s eyes widened - with both surprise, and a shocking amount of eager anticipation. The voice belonged to...</p>
