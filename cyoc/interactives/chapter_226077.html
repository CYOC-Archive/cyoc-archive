<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the long weekend over, Casseus and Rick now began to make their way towards the conferences room. The Boss wanted a progress report.<br />
<br />
For the pair of dark wizards, today marked a little over a year since their arrival in the past. During that time, the Boss and his subordinates had gone about establishing the One Humanity in one timeline while strengthening the Normal in the other. The process hadn&#39;t been easy, however, the Boss was quite persuasive. Within months he had found powerful businessmen and other influential figures in both timelines eager to assist. It resulted in the One Humanity recruiting thousands of willing members to its side with others sympathizing with their message. Couple that with powerful financial backers and the future was looking bright.<br />
<br />
The Boss though wasn&#39;t satisfied, useing his abilities in his timeline to forge a formidable force. Bringing his most trusted lieutenants from the future as well as some of his more elite soldiers. Still, trying to defeat a group of powerful wizards and their allies would take more. This was where the genius of the Boss really shined. Their were thousands perhaps millions of homeless or missing people throughout the world. These people would either not be missed or would be thought dead. The Boss would use these forgotten masses as his own, all it would cost them was their free will.<br />
<br />
&quot;So any idea what the Boss wants to talk about,&quot; Rick asked. &quot;A progress report no doubt,&quot; Casseus replied. &quot;Your attempted abduction of the Catalyst not withstanding, our actions have drawn quite a bit of attention in both timelines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That operation was approved Casseus,&quot; Rick grumbled. &quot;And we gathered valuable information on both Chenoa and Travis.&quot; Casseus raised an eyebrow, glancing at his young companion. The lessons the Boss had given Rick had born fruit. Rick was indeed becoming a powerful sorcerer, but the teenager craved more. With the spell he had learned to extract the essence of his victims, Casseus realized that both Travis and Chenoa&#39;s magic were a high priority for him to acquire. &quot;Dont get cocky Mr. Nelson,&quot; Casseus warned Rick. &quot;Trust me when I say arrogance will lead to your downfall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the conference room, both Rick and Casseus now observed around 15 people gathered within. These politicians, businessmen, and titans of industry worked with the Normal. Providing financial and political support, these men wanted a place in the world the Boss was designing. Already Rick could see Choon Hee talking with a group of Asian men, the kumiho in human form dressed in a professional yet seductive red dress. &quot;Rick,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Cameron Bridges. Mr. Bridges has been supervising the operations of the One Humanity in the other timeline.&quot; Rick extended his hand, studying thr man carefully.<br />
<br />
Cameron Bridges was a handsome, well built man in his mid forties. With well kept blonde hair and a million dollar smile, Ruck got the impression of someone with political aspirations. &quot;Mr. Nelson,&quot; Cameron replied, flashing his brilliant smile. &quot;Casseus tells me great things about you.&quot; Rick could only offer a small thank you, still unsure of the man. <br />
<br />
The sound of a door opening now drew everyone&#39;s attention. Casseus and Rick watched as the Boss entered the room. Adorned in his green and beige robes with the now adult vampire Ann by his side, he instructed everyone to be seated as he approached the head of the table. &quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;A little over a year ago we came together with one, singular, goal. To shape the next century in our image. So far, things have proceeded as planned. In some cases I would say we&#39;ve exceeded expectations. Still, much is left to be done and with the emergence of the Catalyst we have very little room for error.&quot; The Boss now pointed to the diminutive Dr. Eastly, asking for an update on her research.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is proceeding as expected sir,&quot; she stated. Rick gazed at the woman curiously. A rare disease had reduced the grown woman in staure and appearance to that of a 10 year old child. Apparently her early work in cellular regeneration had afflicted the good doctor herself, leaving a humorous chili version of herself. &quot;And what of Felicity,&quot; the Boss asked. &quot;How is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes adjusting sir,&quot; Dr. Eastly replied. &quot;Withon a week, she should be fully matured and ready to takeover as the head of operations for the One Humanity.&quot; A murmur now arose amongst the assembled board members. Cameron rising to his feet as he stared at the Boss. &quot;Excuse me head of the One Humanity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that&#39;s right Cameron is their a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There certainly is,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;I&#39;ve done everything! Provided political and financial support. Not to mention the men I&#39;ve recruited as well as paid for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I appreciate that Cameron,&quot; the Boss stated. &quot;However, the men you&#39;ve brought in have been nothing but thugs and lowlives. Take that incident near West High. Those were your people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They took it a bit too far is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit too far,&quot; the Boss stated. Casseus and Rick exchanged a glance, sensing the annoyance in his voice. &quot;Unloading a clip into someone is a bit too far, beating someone into a bloody pulp is too far, this! This was savagery for the sake of shock value. All you did was embolden our enemies snd sway public opinion against us.&quot; Cameron seethe, the man rising to his feet as he glared at the Boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;And those men you brought in Cameron,&quot; the Boss continued, his voice tense. &quot;Are loyal to you, not me. I&#39;m already aware of your political aspirations. You want to be a Senator and you&#39;re going to use humanitys fear of magic and the mystical to gain power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having a ally in government would only help!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help you Cameron,&quot; the Boss countered. &quot;And if the tide turned you&#39;d switch sides in a minute to hold onto what power you had. No, I&#39;ve seen plenty of guys like you over the years. Spineless worms only interested in protecting their own ass!&quot; Cameron turned red in anger. The Boss wasn&#39;t wrong, he would turn on him once he gained enough power. He just didn&#39;t like it thrown in his face. As he looked to counter, he realized just outclassed he was.<br />
<br />
It was over in seconds. One moment Cameron had been standing their arguing with the Boss. The next, the Bosses smoking revolver was fired. Cameron rocked backwards, blood and brain matter pooling on the conference table. A single shot had rang out through the room, the Boss quickly drawing his weapon before placing a shot between Cameron&#39;s eyes. No one said a word, the board stunned by the Bosses brutality.<br />
<br />
With a wave of his hand, the Boss now conjured forth green lighting from his fingertips. Gasps of horror now escaped the other board members lips as the body of Cameron Bridges lurched to life. &quot;What can I do for you Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Eastly do you need a janitor,&quot; the Boss asked. Eastly nodded, her eyes wide in terror as she gazed at the animated corpse of Cameron Bridges. &quot;Fantastic,&quot; the Boss smiled. &quot;Cameron grab a bucket and report to Eastlys lab. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all sorts of things that need to be cleaned.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Cameron left the room, those who knew the Boss closely could only smirk. Anyone on the board planning on betraying the Boss now knew better.</p>
