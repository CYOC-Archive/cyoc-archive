<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gleb was in a tough spot. After what seemed like a longest run of his life, his chest seemed ready to burst, <br />
lungs no longer even contracting, more like having spasms in attempt to keep up with desperate gasps for air… <br />
Powerless, he almost fell onto a huge fallen tree trunk, unable to make another step. Woods… Hostile, unkind <br />
woods that hold no place for a man like him. It won’t be long until this planet kills him. Either with teeth <br />
and claws or with guns and knives… Humans can be as vile and vicious as any predator, perhaps even more so… <br />
And they are much more persistent. But he just can’t move anymore… For a few long minutes he could only lie <br />
there, face against bark, hoarse uneven breathing shaking his entire body. Eventually, though, he let out a <br />
sigh, which sounded more like a groan, and slipped off the tree, putting his back against the trunk. His whole <br />
body ached, exhaustion dulling his mind and torturing every cell of his body, as it seemed. He had never been <br />
this tired in his entire life…<br />
<br />
	Such an ordeal was really tough for a man of his age. He is no boy after all, 43 is a respectable age. <br />
Plus, scientists are not really most trained guys, he chuckled. Gleb tried to relax, sitting a bit more <br />
comfortably against a tree. If he can’t run for now, he might as well spend some time thinking. This planet <br />
seemed like such a good place to settle at first sight… A distant frontier planet, an outpost on the edge of <br />
known space… He found himself more than welcome as a doctor in an average settlement that consisted mainly of <br />
trappers and huntsmen. He quickly found himself with a reputation of honest, reliable man. There were not many <br />
people with medical education around, and none even close to his level. Plus, his methods were somewhat… <br />
unorthodox. In central worlds, his hands were tied by numerous regulations and acts which first hindered his <br />
research and then led it into a dead-end. So, things that he would never get away with in actual civilization, <br />
he was free to try here. <br />
<br />
	Mostly, he was extremely successful. Injuries that would be otherwise lethal or at least crippling, <br />
damaged brain cells, dangerous native viruses of this planet… Curing those went well enough for people to <br />
overlook  some of the less successful experiments, unexpected side effects and actual failures. For instance, <br />
when he was helping a near-blind girl regain her eyesight, her genome went haywire, recombining with modifcant <br />
DNA in a different way than intended. Luckily, he managed to localize the effects, preventing it from <br />
affecting her organism too much. Still, she ended up with eyes of a local lizard, right forearm becoming more <br />
of a lizard’s claw, and several internal changes. Or there was the case, when clearing out a heavy smoker's <br />
lungs led to both lungs and larynx mutation, which resulted in him talking with screeches and chirps. Then <br />
there was an almost comedic case of local hooker asking for a boob job… Well, boobs did grow. As well as <br />
bovine udder on her lower abdomen, which also lactated, just as her newly-grown breasts. Although, after <br />
calming down, she decided to accept such turn of events – of course, after Gleb promised to fix everything as <br />
soon as possible. However, he did have a suspicion, that he wasn’t to blame for this, as the nurse that worked <br />
with him was suspiciously cheerful for a few days after that… But that wasn’t really much of an issue. People <br />
in the village wouldn’t become enemies because of a joke like this, so it actually became an anecdote, and the <br />
udder girl even decided to stay like this after some time.<br />
<br />
	Some might have considered his experimenting unethical indeed. But in the end, all he ever wanted was <br />
to help people. Medicine is bound by too much rules, it’s progress is too slow – and people continue to die. <br />
People that might have survived if medical industry was willing to take risks. Gleb wasn’t alone, but his <br />
voice was unheard in higher echelons, so he left for the place where he wouldn’t depend on their permissions. <br />
Some of the colleagues who supported him continued to provide him with money and materials, knowing well that <br />
his life won’t be an easy one on the frontier. But no one could even imagine how much. <br />
<br />
	Outskirt planet without official government and handful of towns and settlements is a perilous place <br />
to live, filled with all kinds of danger. Most of the wildlife was brutally hostile to human, but at least <br />
hunters made a living off their survival struggle. The real trouble was another kind of predator. Sentient <br />
ones, both humans and those, who didn’t belong to human race, obeying only one law – the law of the sword. If <br />
you are not strong enough to protect yourself… . Raid for supplies, ransom, slaves, or just the thrill of it <br />
are quite a common leisure time for bandits. Still, until recently, they preferred not to alienate the <br />
hunters, aware that it won’t be easy to beat them. Status quo lasted for seven years, seven happy years of <br />
relatively normal life…However, settlements fate was decided when a well-organized, well-equipped and <br />
ruthlessly efficient band attacked it, with seemingly no other goal than to raze it to the ground. <br />
<br />
	Gleb wasn’t a very brave man, and neither was he capable of contributing to village’s defense. So, <br />
when he realized that battle was decided, he took a case with samples of his most important work projects, led <br />
his old glide-car out of the garage and reluctantly started the engine. He did manage to get away. He stopped <br />
several times, attempting to save someone, take them with him, but each time it was futile. When he got out of <br />
town, his car was riddled with bullet holes, and burn marks. No one whom he knew responded via communicator.<br />
<br />
	As he drove his machine above the trees at full speed, he fought tears of horror and despair. He <br />
couldn’t allow his sight to be blurred. But the sorrow was almost driving him mad. The village was doomed. <br />
Populace either massacred or worse… His home, his friends, his clinic… All of it consumed by scorching flames <br />
of someone’s greed and violence… It was so unfair! The good natured people he knew didn’t deserve such fate! <br />
And yet… Those who proved stronger had the right to decide the village’s fate.  <br />
<br />
	His glide-car was damaged, flying low, slow and leaving a long dirty trail of black smoke. No surprise <br />
that raider glider appeared soon. He was shot down, crashing into the trees. Luckily, he survived the fall, <br />
and hasn’t even been injured. He ran ever since, torturing his body for hours, forcing it to move on willpower <br />
alone when his muscles already gave up… Still, eventually even the willpower ran out. All that is left now is <br />
a case of vials, old low-power energy gun which might not even work, and his life. Not much to lose.<br />
<br />
	With this thought, Gleb raised his head, sighed, and proceeded to…</p>
