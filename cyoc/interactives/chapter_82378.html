<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>As the pain subsided after what felt like an eternity I heard a man say, "You can't exit the Cyber World with the trap on your head." He 
laughed then continued with, "As you just found out every time you try to say exit it sends a pulse of debilitating pain through you. The 
normal reaction to that pain is to scream this preventing you from leaving the Cyber World."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do with me?" I asked having got my breath back.</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, "Why you'll be served up as dinner for some connoisseurs of the flesh.</p>
<p>I had to laugh at that. After calming down a bit I said, "You can't eat me. As soon as I die I'll... leave the Cyber World." I had just about 
said exit before remembering that I'd experience a lot of pain if I did.</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, "Just keep telling yourself that." He came up to me and wrenched my arms behind my back before tying 
them together. He roughly picked me up and shoved me forward almost causing me to fall flat on my face. I really had no choice but to 
walk in front of the man and follow his directions. A couple times he shoved me and told me to hurry up. At last we came to what looked 
like a kitchen except that there was a guillotine in it and several heads lined up on one wall. There were heads of young children as well 
as adult heads and what could only be anthropomorphic heads. All of them had one thing in common. They were all wearing what looked 
like a tiara. "The trap keeps them alive," the man said behind me then laughed, "and your head will soon be there with them."</p>
<p>"They can't be real," I said looking at the heads. They were undoubtedly dead if they were real heads. Of course they may have set a 
delay but I had a hard time believing that so many would. But if the trap could keep them alive but dead at the same time... a cold chill 
went down my spine at the thought. That was torture on a whole different level and my head would be joining them. Realizing this I tried to 
run but the man who brought me here and another one grabbed me and started dragging me toward the guillotine. I of course started 
struggling and screaming but it was no use. The men pushed me against the bascule and in moments I was horizontal with my head in the 
lunette. One of the men held me down while the other pulled my hair through and closed the lunette. As I heard the click of the lunette 
locking in place I ceased struggling. There was no way I was going to get out of it.</p>
<p>The man that brought me said, "Looks like she's accepted her fate."</p>
<p>"She's a smart one then," the other man said going behind me. I felt him grab one of my feet and put what felt like rope around it then 
he did the same with my other foot. "Now remember to haul her body up to let the blood drain once her head is severed."</p>
<p>I was scared and my heart was beating very fast. I knew that it wouldn't take long for the blood to empty from my body, especially once 
it was hanging upside down. I looked into the basket below my head and tried to prepare myself for what was to come. I saw the other 
man's legs out of the corner of my eye and resolved to keep looking in the basket. I didn't want to twist my head and see him smiling at me 
as he pulled the handle. I heard a little click and a whoosh an instant before my head was falling into the basket. Incredibly I didn't feel any 
pain from my head being severed. Must have happened so fast that my nerves were overwhelmed by it. I did feel my head hit the bottom 
of the basket and the ropes around my feet pulling my body up. That part was strange since my head was no longer attached to my body. 
I felt my heart beating wildly as it tried to keep circulating my blood which was squirting out. The other man picked up my head and carried 
it over to the other heads and placed it on a plate that had three spikes on it, one of which was rounded and went up my throat. As the 
man put something on my eyes to keep them open I felt my heart stop and my body relax. The man moved away and I saw him move 
over to my body and pick up a knife. I felt the pain as he cut my abdomen open and felt him pulling out my insides. I knew then that I 
would be feeling everything that happened to my body. My vision started to go black and the man that was disemboweling me said, "Fuck 
she's going back."</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The hotel room I had been in faded back into view but now there was a huge spider right in front of my face. Now I'm not afraid of 
spiders but when one is right in front of you unexpectedly the natural reaction is to scream and backpedal which is what I did. 
Unfortunately there was something behind me and I tripped falling backwards. I landed on my butt and hit the watch on something hard 
enough to break it. I looked at the ruined watch on my wrist and knew that I wouldn't be able to use it again. I looked at what I had tripped 
over and found a chunk of concrete. Looking up at the ceiling I found where it had come from. I looked around to see what condition the 
room was in and saw a message on one wall. <b><I>BEWARE THE DARK ONES</I></b> it said. I wondered who the Dark Ones were. 
Maybe they were some sort of gang which meant there were people here. As I got up I felt something different about my body. My heart 
sped up with excitement and not caring if anyone saw me or not I pulled up my skirt and pulled down my panties. What I saw brought a 
smile to my face for I now had female genitals. My chest was still flat but that didn't matter too much at this point. Pulling my panties back 
up and letting my skirt fall back down I looked around again. Seeing that the door was no longer there I went out and peered back up the 
hall toward the elevator. I couldn't be sure if Tina was still in the Cyber World or not but something seemed to be urging me on to some 
place. With a last look back into the room to see if I had missed anything I headed toward elevator and the hopefully intact stairs.</p></p>
