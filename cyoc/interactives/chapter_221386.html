<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, I got the rest of the day off, and I&#39;m not spending it cooped up indoors so let&#39;s go grab some food.&quot; Fitch said as he stepped out of the bedroom hanging up the phone.<br />
<br />
Russ looked up, nose twitching as the rabbit reappeared, making him pull the blanket over his lap a little more to hide a growing problem. &quot;Sure, soon as you give me my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fitch shook his head. &quot;Uh-uh. We found you passed out in an alley, remember? You&#39;re lucky if washing them can save them, c&#39;mon, you can borrow some of mine until we go pick yours up.&quot; The rabbit turned right around and motioned for Russ to follow him back into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Russ blushed, thinking of standing up, which would definitely show off his tented boxer-briefs for Russ to see. God, why did he have to be so good looking. &quot;Um, you can just hand me some and I&#39;ll get dressed out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look the Fitch gave him was clearly amused. &quot;C&#39;mon, like I don&#39;t know you&#39;ve been hiding your boner for me since you woke up. Worst I&#39;m gonna accuse you of is having good taste in men.&quot; He chuckled and stepped over to Russ, taking the him by the arm and almost dragging him into the bedroom. The rabbit&#39;s grip on his arm was surprisingly strong, and made his problem even worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No. It&#39;s not like that. I&#39;m not.. I mean, you are, but I..&quot; Russ started to babble until his felt a hand around his muzzle, holding his mouth shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve never been with a guy before have you?&quot; Unable to open his mouth, Russ just shook his head to the question. &quot;And girls?&quot; Fitch removed his hand and Russ sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once, earlier this year. Dale hooked me up with her I, uh, it didn&#39;t work.&quot; Russ blushed as Fitch went over to his closet and started digging inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;That when you figured it out?&quot; Fitch said curiously, pulling out a couple of items and tossing them to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I knew before then, but, yeah, it kind of confirmed it.&quot; Russ awkwardly tried to position his hands, still trying to hide himself from Fitch even if the rabbit wasn&#39;t looking directly at him at the moment. But just watching him, the way he held himself, the way his muscles moved under his fur. Russ had had crushes before but Fitch was feeling like something different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip, you need fresh underwear, too.&quot; Fitch said matter-of-factly as he tossed a pair to the bed and turned back around. &quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.. could you.. I mean, could I..&quot; Russ started mumbling again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for god&#39;s sake.&quot; Fitch stepped right over and put his hands on the waistband of Russ&#39; underwear, pushing it down low enough that it fell to his ankles, letting his erection pop free, pointing right at the rabbit as if declaring &#39;that&#39;s the one I want.&#39; &quot;If we&#39;re gonna be roommates we might as well get used to seeing each other naked. Or you better get used to it because I don&#39;t usually wear clothes in the apartment unless I have a guest. And you aren&#39;t a guest anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Russ blushed as a squeak escaped him, his hands trying to cover himself up, then he looked up at Fitch and let his hands drop back to his sides. Then feeling a swell of confidence he said, &quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what?&quot; Fitch asked one ear twitching slightly as he grinned a little in amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said I wasn&#39;t a guest anymore.&quot; Russ replied, motioning to Fitch&#39;s clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was going to go out in this, but I guess fair&#39;s fair.&quot; Fitch said, lifting the tank over his head and tossing it aside. Even under the fluffy fur, Russ could make out the lean and well-cut definition of his chest and abs. Then he dropped his shorts and underwear in one motion, sliding them over his thighs and then kicking them aside once they hit the floor. Russ glanced down and blushed to see the rabbit was just as hard as he was, sure it was a little bigger than his, but the rabbit was just bigger than him overall. &quot;Maybe we should take care of this first.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Take care of what?&quot; Russ asked as Fitch placed a paw on his chest, then sent Russ falling back on the bed with a light push.<br />
<br />
The rat flopped on the mattress, bouncing again as the rabbit landed next to him. &quot;This.&quot; Fitch said as Russ gasped softly as he felt a paw wrap around his cock. He opened his mouth to say something, but the rabbit stopped him once more, this time by locking muzzles with him. Russ gave into the makeout session eagerly, letting soft whimpers escape him as Fitch played with his cock which was getting slicker by the moment as he leaked pre over the rabbit&#39;s paw.<br />
<br />
Fitch pulled back from Russ, kissing the tip of his nose before nibbling his neck, then down his chest. Russ wiggled under the attention, especially as he felt the rabbit nibble lightly on his nipple. &quot;You like that?&quot; Fitch teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes..&quot; Russ said with another gasp as the rabbit went for the other nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;re gonna love this.&quot; Fitch said as he took Russ&#39; cock into his mouth. Russ&#39; tail tip curled as he let out a gasp. He had only had one blowjob before and it was terrible compared to this, Fitch expertly worked his cock, muzzle and tongue working his shaft. Then he felt a precum slicked finger pressing at his tail hole, another squeak escaping him as it slipped inside, it hurt but it was an odd feeling next to having his cock sucked. Fitch lifted his head to look at Russ, smiling. &quot;Try to relax, this will feel better soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Russ tried to do as asked as Fitch lapped at his shaft, a second finger entering him. Then Fitch hit something inside his hole and he gasped. Another few seconds of Fitch&#39;s attention and he felt his cock explode painting the inside of the rabbit&#39;s muzzle with his cum. Fitch lapped a few more times at Russ&#39; softening cock then slide back up the bed to lock muzzles with Russ once more, the kiss was salty and slightly bitter, but Russ was feeling better than he had in a long while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; Fitch asked with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, do you... do you want me to.. uh..&quot; Russ pointed down. &quot;Take care of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fitch laughed, holding up a paw covered in cum. &quot;I pawed myself off, but don&#39;t worry, one day I&#39;m gonna get you to make it up to me. Might take that tail of yours later tonight.&quot; Russ blushed. &quot;Too much?&quot; Fitch asked though he was still grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I, just um..&quot; Russ pushed himself up to sitting. &quot;Why are you being so, well, nice to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fitch propped his head up, looking up at Russ. He gave a small shrug. &quot;Because I think you&#39;re just a guy that&#39;s made some mistakes. I was like that a couple years ago and someone gave me a second chance. It was what I needed so I&#39;m trying to do it for you. The uh, sex is just a bonus I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex?&quot; Russ asked, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t Scrabble what we just did. Anyway, I&#39;m going to get cleaned up, get dressed and we&#39;ll go get food, I&#39;m starving.&quot; Fitch gave Russ one more quick kiss before hoping to his feet and walking into the bathroom, giving his tail a little wiggle for Russ&#39; benefit.<br />
<br />
Russ watched as Fitch disappeared into the bathroom. He looked down at himself and felt for a moment like he was looking at a body that wasn&#39;t his. He squeezed his eyes shut as the world seemed to swim. When he next opened them he was staring at a fluffy, recently washed, concerned looking Fitch kneeling in front of him, one paw on his cheek. &quot;Russ. You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think I&#39;m just hungry.&quot; Russ&#39; voice sounded weird to his own ears but Fitch seemed to accept it with a nod. &quot;Well, get dressed, we&#39;ll go grab a bite, I just want to make a quick call.&quot;</p>
