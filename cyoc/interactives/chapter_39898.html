<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'll make you big again, but you have to swear to be nice to us from now on!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, I swear!&quot; the tiny teacher nodded her head vigorously. I then wished she'd be unable to break that promise.<br />
<br />
I carried her to the front of the room and set her on her desk, then told everyone to get back in their seats. After everyone settled down I wished that Miss Parks would slowly begin regaining her former size, but be unable to get off her desk until I permitted it.<br />
<br />
The other kids were whispering and staring at me as much as they were Miss Parks, so I wished everyone but Miss Parks would forget what I could do, and be unable to notice me making more wishes. Everyone froze for a moment, then settled in to teacher watching.<br />
<br />
By this time Miss Parks was about three feet tall.  She was lying with her head and arms over the edge of her desk trying to grab her clothes off the floor. She strained, and slid forward until her whole torso was hanging down, bare tits flushing red as the blood rushed to her head.  She almost slipped off, but managed to grab the collar of her blouse and wiggle back onto the desktop. The class still thought it was cool to see her naked so as she paused to catch her breath all the kids started complaining;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw! We like you naked Miss Parks!  Don't put your clothes on!  Yeah!  You should get naked for us every day!  Yeah, and let us play with you like before!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Parks was a bit over four feet tall now.  She rolled into a sitting position and held the blouse in front of her.  I watched a number of expressions cross her face before she settled on a shaky smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, OK class,&quot; she said, setting the blouse beside her. &quot;I'll stay naked for you today, and if you do real well on your tests maybe I'll let you see me nude again sometime, OK?&quot;  Ha! her promise was making her 'be nice' to us by showing us her body!  I couldn't wait to use that against her in other ways!<br />
<br />
The class agreed to her suggestion and all watched avidly as our science teacher finally regained her normal height.  She scooted forward so her calves and feet dangled in front of her desk, and demurely crossed one knee over the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, are we ready to learn about resisters?&quot; Most of us sighed and opened our books, but Josh up front raised his hand.  &quot;Yes Josh?&quot; She said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you're another size do we all get another turn at playing with you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Miss Park's face went white and she opened and closed her mouth a few times<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot;  Someone said. &quot;That sounds a lot better than resisters!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Class, I...&quot; I could see white all around the young teacher's eyes, she was starting to panic again.  I decided there wasn't enough time for everyone to have a turn, especially if she freaked out, so I wished Miss Parks' clothes back on, and that the other students would forget all the weird stuff that had happened today.<br />
<br />
The bell went off with a harsh clanging and Miss Parks jerked liked someone had slapped her. &quot;Saved by the bell!&quot;  She called out with a quavering voice. &quot;I want you all to read the first part of chapter 17 tonight, and don't forget we've got a quiz Friday!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other students collected their stuff and filed out into the hallway.  I packed up my stuff and walked to the front of the room.<br />
<br />
Miss Parks was peering down at the floor and frowning.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't get off the desk, can you?&quot;  I asked her.<br />
&quot;I, no.  I can't.&quot; She looked at me, trembling slightly.<br />
&quot;And you know that I can do things to you, if I want.&quot; I smiled.<br />
<br />
Miss Parks' trembling increased and she crossed her arms over her chest. She opened her mouth a couple times, but didn't say anything, finally she nodded and stared down at her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I remember that you swore to be 'nice' to the class, possibly including a strip tease if we do well on that quiz, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears were running down the young teacher's face.  She sobbed, and still not looking at me nodded again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, they'll all still think it's cool, but you won't have to let them play with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She snorted and wiped tears off her face. &quot;I'll be thrown in jail.  They'll take away my license, no one will hire me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wise up!&quot; I snapped.  Miss Parks jerked again and let out a faint keening sound. &quot;If I can reduce you to barbie-size I can certainly ensure that you don't get fired.&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned and headed out of the room.  I paused at the door and called back to her.  &quot;You can get down now.  And I think it'd be *nice* if you started wearing lower necklines to work, and sexier underwear.  Especially if you're going to show it off to us Friday!&quot;  I stepped out into the hall and listened intently.  I heard a couple quiet taps as Miss Parks' heels hit the floor, followed by more sobbing.<br />
<br />
As I started down the hall to my next class I wished that no one would find Miss Parks' story of what happened today remotely odd or out of the ordinary. Another wish and Miss Parks would continue coming to work and otherwise behaving normally.  As I settled down in social studies I was struck by inspiration and wished that as far as everyone but Miss Parks and I were concerned, she and other attractive female teachers were permitted to not only get naked, but have sex with their students on school time, as long as test scores stayed up.<br />
<br />
Grinning to myself I settled in to see what kind of fun I could have with Mr Winthrop once class started.</p>
