<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The party showing continued for an ungodly long time.  Strangers kept coming up and fondling him, and remarking about how great the artist was.  <br />
<br />
Fuck the artist!  I am a human being.  Chad screamed silently.  No one heard.  <br />
<br />
Or perhaps an evil sprite, fate or spirit did, as right after Chad&#39;s last cry that he was human, a stranger remarked, &quot;Oh, the artist is a genius!  He totally captured the essence of this athlete in fiberglass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean there&#39;s a model that looks like that?&quot; asked the person next to him.<br />
<br />
The man remarked, &quot;Oh, I know the artist.  His imagination is limited to what he sees, though he does manage to get his models into very unique poses.  You should see his erotica.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t erotica?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, hardly.&quot;<br />
<br />
A hand caressed his butt. How he wished he could turn his head or his hand and swat the hand away.<br />
<br />
A drunk grabbed his erect cock to catch himself from falling.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it!  That&#39;s the original!&quot; shrieked the artist, &quot;You break it, I&#39;ll break you!&quot;<br />
<br />
After that, the artist had a rope erected around Chad to keep people from touching.  Chad sort of began to miss the human contact.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, the art patrons began to trickle out. The gallery worker closed the door and locked it.  Then began picking up hor&#39;d&#39;oerve plates and abandoned champagne and wine glasses.  The lights went out.  Chad seemed alone at last.  Now he desperately wanted to scratch his nose.<br />
<br />
After a couple hours in the dark, the front bell buzzed loudly.<br />
<br />
A light flicked on in the back of the gallery, and the artist emerged wearing a bathrobe. Well, he was putting the robe on when he passed Chad, but it was closed and tied by the time he reached the front of the shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex!  Oh, and you wore your football gear!  Sweet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Maestro, ready to show me what new poses you can do with Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex?  The voice of that young guy who was here earlier, thought Chad.  Alex?  As the silhouetted figures of a man in a robe and a guy in football gear entered the back gallery room where Chad stood, the lights flickered on.<br />
<br />
Oh, that Alex!  He recognized the green football jersey as belonging to US Grant High.  Alex was the rival team&#39;s captain.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were right, when you said he had the perfect athletic body for a statue.  I already sold 75% of the pre-orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, so how about the next one, we call &quot;HIKE&quot;, with Chad centering the ball, and spreading his bare butt cheeks. That&#39;s what you were suggesting earlier, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HIKE, like Nike.  Heh, heh. The critics will love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The artist had a whistle dangling at the end of a chain around his neck.  He blew it.<br />
<br />
Chad blinked.<br />
<br />
CHAD BLINKED.<br />
<br />
He could move. Well, sort of.  It was like when he first turned blue.  He moved slowly.  His mouth slowly opened in pain, forming an oh. Something was impaling his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, forgot, he&#39;s still mounted.  Help me lift him off, Alex!&quot; <br />
<br />
Hands on him again.  They lifted him off the metal rod that had impaled his ass.  He had been caught in midstride, jumping to catch the ball.  He stood awkwardly on the balls of his feet as he sought to stand upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Chad!  Now instead of receiving, you&#39;re now playing Center.  Spread your legs, bend your knees, and assume the position.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s mind was foggy,  he leaned forward, and positioned the ball in front of him.  He was the Center now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, Maestro, his skin is rubbery now,&quot; remarked Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soft and pliable for posing, and some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is he moving so slowly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he&#39;s still hollow inside, so and while he&#39;s poseable, his mind is like molasses, so his ability to control his body is slowed down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hollow?&quot; asked Alex with a smirk. <br />
<br />
He grabbed Chad&#39;s balls, and yanked and squeezed them.  Air rushed out of Chad&#39;s piss slit making a high pitched squeak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, just like a squeaky toy!&quot; laughed Alex.<br />
<br />
With his balls suddenly crushed, Chad&#39;s mouth reverted to the &quot;Oh&quot; shape.  Alex noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, why don&#39;t we plow both ends at once, and then freeze him.  You can tell people he&#39;s yelling HIKE!  Or 3, 2, 1, Zero, if they ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
The artist slowly opened his robe, and his thick cock flopped out.<br />
<br />
Chad wasn&#39;t really aware about what was going to happen, until after it happened.  Alex pulled down his football pants and compression shorts, and proceeded to fuck Chad&#39;s blue rubbery mouth, while the artist plowed Chad&#39;s ass.  It felt better than the metal spike had.  Then the whistle blew.  Chad stiffened up.  He was frozen fiberglass again, but now with two cooling loads of warm cum.  One in his throat, and one in his ass. They could&#39;ve at least used condoms, thought Chad.  His mind had resumed normal speed, and he was aware again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like another masterpiece,&quot; laughed Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, enough foreplay, let&#39;s get to the main event!&quot;<br />
<br />
Artist draped his robe across Chad&#39;s back and ass.  Then, he proceeded to undress Alex from his football uniform and padding.<br />
<br />
The futon sofa, was now spread on the floor as a mattress, and while Chad watched, his two captors had hot sloppy sex in front of him.  They smoked, and Alex snorted some powder that the artist gave him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Alex, HIKE doesn&#39;t look quite right?&quot; the artist remarked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think he looks great, Maestro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, now his cock is flaccid, and the mouth should look more surprised.  Let&#39;s soften him up, and you fuck him this time.  You have a bigger cock, maybe that will achieve the effect it needs?&quot; asked the artist.<br />
<br />
Alex stood up and yanked on his semisoft cock to get it stiff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Maestro,&quot; Alex answered whipping the robe off Chad to reveal his blue butt.<br />
<br />
Coach blew the whistle twice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, down set!  Hut One!&quot; shouted the Maestro, &quot;Now plow his ass, Alex, and say Hike!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex grinned, and buried his erection in Chad&#39;s blue warm soft ass.  Interesting, the mouth had been cold rubber, thought Alex. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hike!&quot; shouted Alex just as the artist blew his whistle.<br />
<br />
Everything slowed down for Alex.  He hadn&#39;t noticed his skin turn blue.  He felt his hardon stiffen permanently. Chad&#39;s mouth was trapped in a  perfect Oh now. And both boys&#39; hands were touching the football.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, Alex.  I know I promised you a week in Hawaii, but since everyone is expecting you to be gone a week anyway.  I think I&#39;ll take the opportunity to make molds of you two, and instead let you spend a week in Chad.  Then we can pose him making a touchdown.  And I&#39;ll take you to Hawaii for reals.  You just tell everyone, you decided to stay an extra week,&quot; laughed the artist.  He turned off the lights, and remarked, &quot;I gotta pee.&quot;  He exited back through the doorway he had first emerged.  He had an apartment over the studio/gallery.</p>
