<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[b]Authors Note:  This is the continuation of ‘My Girlfriend Is An Animal’, though the focus will instead be <br />
on Clemens Patten, who was a recurring character in the up to this point in the story.  Tricky bit for me at <br />
this early stage was figuring out where he could live to be close to an airport that can get him to where <br />
Joseph Patten lives in Columbia Falls, Montana, on top of being close to a zoo since I’d already established <br />
that that was where he worked.  [/b]<br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
For anyone else at Kalispell City Airport, they’d be more than a little surprised to see him exiting the <br />
terminal alongside his Fianc&eacute;, Jenny.  Clemens Patten, thirty-seven years of age and one of those who’d taken <br />
the Animatrix Serum, which meant he now resembled a mix between human and African Rock Python.  Even though <br />
the Animatrix Serum had been legal for some time now, it was still a rarity in some parts, though his thick <br />
sweater and pants, along with proper footwear probably helped to keep some of the attention off of them.  <br />
<br />
“That, wasss a [i]long[/i] flight.”  Clemens groaned, finally able to stretch himself properly.  <br />
<br />
“Well at least it’s over now.”  Jenny replied softly, wrapping one arm around him.  <br />
<br />
“That part isss, ssstill have to get all the luggage and the car.”  Clemens responded, his hissing lisp still <br />
there, and his right arm around her now.  “And then there’sss the drive over to Columbia Fallsss.  At leassst <br />
they got a car I can use thisss time.”  That brought a slight giggle from Jenny, who remembered his tale about <br />
how he’d ended up having to call Joseph to pick him up, since they didn’t have one that he could drive in <br />
thanks to his lengthy tail.  <br />
<br />
For their stay, they’d managed to fit everything they needed into two large wheeled luggage carriers and had <br />
them in tow on their way to collect their rental car.  <br />
<br />
“Clemensss Patten and Jenny Taylor.”  Clemens spoke to the man at the counter for Car Rentals, producing the <br />
documents to show that they had a car waiting.  <br />
<br />
“R-Right.  One moment then.”  He stammered slightly, the sight strange to him though he seemed to pull himself <br />
together, returning a few minutes later with a set of keys in hand.  “Here you go then.  Enjoy your time <br />
here.”  He at least managed that part with a smile on his face.  <br />
<br />
“Thanksss, we will.”  Clemens replied as he took the keys.  <br />
<br />
Looking inside the car once they approached it - a Ford SUV - Clemens was relieved to see that it did have the <br />
tail-hole in the backrest like they said it would.  Once they had their luggage in, they were good to go.  <br />
After an embrace and kiss of course.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
“So?”  Jenny asked as they travelled along the roads.  “Are we gonna see George and Molly?”  Having never <br />
actually seen them before.  <br />
<br />
“We will.”  Clemens answered with the closest thing to a smile that he could manage.  “But by the time we get <br />
there, it’ll be getting late, ssso we’ll need to sssee them tomorrow.  Don‘t worry, we won‘t be leaving ‘til <br />
we’ve ssseen them and their new kidsss.”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah.”  She sighed to herself.  “I just wonder when we can have our own children, that’s all.”  <br />
<br />
“When we’re ready for them.  Remember, I have some sssperm stocked, ssso there’s no issssue there.”  He took <br />
her hand for a moment.  “And besssidesss, we can have a few yearsss to ourssselvesss firssst.”  <br />
<br />
“We’re talking mid-thirties to forties here.  That is a bit late”  Jenny pointed out, even if she sounded <br />
better about it.  <br />
<br />
“Well.  The Pattensss have tended to be late ssstartersss in that field.”  Referring to the fact that their <br />
family tree showed a trend of having children around their mid to late-thirties.  “Tradition, if you will.”  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
Having reached Columbia Falls now, they navigated the streets to find Joseph’s house again, the Sun getting <br />
low in the sky as Jenny gave the directions while Clemens followed them, meaning that soon enough, they’d <br />
reached his house.  <br />
<br />
Getting out of the car, they’d just made it to the front of the garden when the door opened.  <br />
<br />
“Clemens!”  Joseph cried out as he approached them.  “Great to see you again!”  As they embraced each other, a <br />
friendly slap on each other’s backs.  <br />
<br />
“You as well Jenny.  Nice to see you again.”  Joseph greeted her with a hug and kiss on her cheek.  “Come on <br />
in.”  <br />
<br />
Clemens quickly took the bags from the trunk before following his cousin inside, leaving them in the hallway <br />
for the time being.  <br />
<br />
“Dinner’s almost ready now, so do you want to take care of your luggage now?”  <br />
<br />
“Not right now.”  Clemens answered cheerfully.  “It can wait.”  <br />
<br />
“I just need to use the bathroom a minute.”  Jenny added in.  <br />
<br />
“Upstairs, left, and second on the right.”  Joseph told her where it was, as she left to head there.  <br />
<br />
“Ssso.”  Clemens asked Joseph while they were alone.  “Jenny’sss been itching to sssee George and Molly for a <br />
while now.  You know any good time to?”  <br />
<br />
“Well.”  Joseph took his time to think it through.  “Molly’s on Maternity Leave right now, so she’ll be in <br />
their home tomorrow.  So you could call her to see when George would be back and time the visit then.”  <br />
<br />
“I think I’ll call and find out after dinner then.”  Clemens decided.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
A few minutes later and they were all seated, enjoying their meals.  Though Clemens had a complete lack of <br />
vegetables, his digestive system only capable of handling meat these days, though at least he could still <br />
tolerate a select group of herbs and spices well enough to provide some flavour and variety.  <br />
<br />
“So what’s happened here recently?”  Jenny asked.  “I mean besides George and Molly’s new kids?”  Herself and <br />
Clemens not being as up to speed with developments in Columbia Falls.  <br />
<br />
“Well another big piece was in November.”  Joseph began.  “Tabitha Choir managed to unseat Wayne Hireman to <br />
take over as School Superintendent for here.”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I remember [i]him[/i].”  Clemens remarked sourly.  Despite only encountering him once, he had left a <br />
black mark with Clemens, so who knows what George and Molly must’ve gone through.  <br />
<br />
“Still, that’s in the past now.  The last of Beauregard’s influence removed.”  <br />
<br />
“That’s good to hear.”  Jenny noted.  <br />
<br />
“So how are things in Jacksonville?”  Joseph moved the conversation forwards.  <br />
<br />
“They’re going well.”  Clemens replied once he’d finished swallowing.  “We might have another breeding pair <br />
there now.”  <br />
<br />
“That’s good to hear.  And you Jenny?”  <br />
<br />
“Very steady right now.  Nothing serious happening.”  <br />
<br />
“Ah.  That’s good news to hear, nothing bad happening.”  <br />
<br />
The rest of dinner and its aftermath was taken up by this.  Catching up on each other’s events, seeing how <br />
each other was doing these days.  Until the big question arrived.  <br />
<br />
“So when’s the day?”  <br />
<br />
“Hm?”  Clemens wondered what Joseph referred to.  <br />
<br />
“Your marriage?  And congratulations to the two of you as well!”  <br />
<br />
“Oh!  That’sss at the beginning of August!”  Clemens answered, now that they were on the same page again.  <br />
“You sure you can make it?”  <br />
<br />
“I’ll try, but with Molly on Leave now, we’d be understaffed.  I’ll do what I can, but no promises can be <br />
made.”  <br />
<br />
“Well.  As long as you try.”  Jenny consoled him.  <br />
<br />
“In any case, what are your honeymoon plans?”  Joseph sought to move to a more cheerful topic.  <br />
<br />
“Arranged an RV trek across the country.  Travel the roads, see the sights, just Clemens and me.”  Jenny <br />
replied, her smile widening at the thought of it.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
It was now much later, and almost time to get some sleep now.  Clemens and Jenny had just finished getting <br />
their stuff out, and Clemens had his shows and socks off, now pulling his sweater off, Jenny in simple <br />
nightwear beside him.  <br />
<br />
“Ssso I asssked, and it looksss like we’ll be able to head over at about sixxx tomorrow.”  Clemens let Jenny <br />
know when they’d be able to visit.  “We’d get there onccce George hasss had time to relaxxx a bit.”  <br />
<br />
“That’s great!”  Jenny replied excitedly as she wrapped her arms around his bare torso, their matching <br />
engagement rings on their respective hands while he was working on getting his pants off.  <br />
<br />
“Sssay.  We have the RV hired, but where exxxactly should we head?”  Clemens asked as his slid under the <br />
covers with Jenny.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t know.”  Jenny responded.  “But we have time to work it all out.  I’m sure we’ll think of <br />
somewhere to head.”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah.”  Clemens agreed.  “And it’s something we can do while we’re here, when we’re not with Joseph, or <br />
George and Molly, or visiting the Glacier National Park.”  <br />
<br />
“We won’t have a lot off time for that then.”  Jenny stated the obvious.  <br />
<br />
“I know, but it’s something to think about.”  Clemens answered with a loving kiss.  “Night then Jenny.”  <br />
<br />
“Night Clemens.”</p>
