<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timmy crouched in the center of the room, his massive frame taking up nearly every inch of available space. The ceiling creaked and groaned as his head brushed against it, even in his hunched position. His impossibly muscular body loomed over Jamie like a living monument to raw power. Jamie’s legs felt weak beneath him as he tried to process the sheer scale of his younger brother—his little brother who now looked like he could grab and crush Jamie’s head like a grape with just one hand.<br />
<br />
The power Timmy now wielded was terrifying. Every movement of his colossal frame made the room tremble. His massive arms, thick as tree trunks, hung by his sides, and his hands—easily large enough to engulf Jamie’s entire torso—twitched with barely restrained strength. Jamie’s heart raced as he tried to push down the rising tide of panic. And yet, the most frightening part was the uncertainty: was Timmy’s body even done growing?<br />
<br />
The room felt suffocating with Timmy’s overwhelming presence. His sheer size and musculature were almost incomprehensible, every inch of him rippling with obscene power. Jamie’s eyes darted to his brother’s cock, which lay slack against the floor—a truly monstrous appendage that seemed almost alive. Even flaccid, it was impossibly huge, the girthy length snaking across the hardwood like some terrifying creature. Then, to Jamie’s horror, it began to swell, thickening and lengthening as it grew rock hard. The angry purple glans pointed directly at Jamie, glistening with pre-cum, and the sound of Timmy’s churning, impossibly swollen balls filled the room with a low, ominous hum.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh... Jamie,” Timmy groaned, his deep, rumbling voice trembling with both pleasure and frustration. His massive hands clenched and unclenched, the veins on his forearms bulging as though they might burst. “It’s... there’s so much... I can’t stop it...” His voice broke into a guttural moan, his massive body quivering as waves of testosterone and hormones surged through his veins, pumping directly into his brain. Every moan and grunt from Timmy sent shivers down Jamie’s spine.<br />
<br />
Jamie gulped, frozen in place as Timmy’s immense cock throbbed, pointing straight at him like a weapon. The heat radiating from Timmy’s body was oppressive, filling the room with an almost primal intensity. Jamie’s mind raced as he tried to think of a way—any way—to get Timmy out of the house. But the logistics were impossible. There was no way Timmy could fit through a door at this point, not with his gargantuan size. And even if they somehow managed to force him through, his broad shoulders, massive lats, and sheer girth would destroy anything in his path.<br />
<br />
“How... how are we going to get you out of here?” Jamie stammered, his voice trembling as he backed up against the wall. Timmy’s head turned toward him, his expression a mix of embarrassment and helplessness. “Timmy, there’s no way you can fit through the door. You’re... you’re way too big.”<br />
<br />
Timmy nodded slowly, his massive body shifting as he tried to crouch lower, only for his broad back to brush against the ceiling, cracking the plaster. “I... I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice soft despite its deep rumble. “I don’t want to break anything, Jamie, but...” He trailed off, glancing around the room nervously.<br />
<br />
Jamie’s gaze darted toward the walls of the house, his mind reluctantly arriving at a single, insane solution. He took a shaky breath, trying to steady himself before speaking. “Timmy... you might just have to... walk through the walls.” The words felt absurd even as he said them, but what other choice did they have? “I mean, there’s no other way at this point. You’re just... you’re too big.”<br />
<br />
Timmy’s eyes widened, and he glanced down at Jamie, his expression a mix of concern and hesitation. “You really think I should?” he asked, his massive hands fidgeting nervously. “What if I break too much? What if...”<br />
<br />
“Timmy, look around,” Jamie interrupted, gesturing to the cracked ceiling and the trembling walls. “You’re already breaking the house just by being in it. If we don’t get you out of here soon, the whole place might come down around us.” He swallowed hard, trying to sound braver than he felt. “Just... just stand up and walk through. We’ll figure out the rest later.”<br />
<br />
Timmy hesitated, his massive frame trembling slightly as he glanced around the room one last time. Then, with a deep, resolute breath, he nodded. “Okay,” he said softly. “I’ll... I’ll do it.”<br />
<br />
Jamie stepped back, pressing himself against the far wall as Timmy began to rise. The sound was deafening—the creak and groan of the house giving way to Timmy’s unstoppable body. His head smashed through the ceiling as he stood to his full, towering height, chunks of drywall and insulation raining down around him. Jamie shielded his face, peeking through his arms to watch in terrified awe as Timmy’s body filled the space like a living wrecking ball.<br />
<br />
Timmy took a tentative step forward, his colossal foot crashing through the floorboards as though they were paper. He winced, glancing back at Jamie with an apologetic look. “Sorry,” he muttered, though his deep voice shook the very walls.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine,” Jamie said quickly, his voice barely audible over the chaos. “Just... keep going.”<br />
<br />
Timmy nodded again, taking another step. This time, his massive shoulder collided with the wall, smashing through it like it was made of cardboard. The entire house shuddered as Timmy’s immense body tore through it with ease, his obscene strength on full display. He moved cautiously, trying to minimize the damage, but his sheer size made it impossible. Each step, each movement, brought more destruction, until finally, Timmy stood outside, his massive frame towering over the remains of the wall he had just walked through.<br />
<br />
Jamie stumbled out after him, his heart pounding as he took in the sight of his little brother standing in the open air. Timmy’s massive chest heaved as he looked down at the ruined house, his expression a mix of guilt and relief. “I’m sorry, Jamie,” he said quietly, his deep voice carrying a hint of shame. “I didn’t mean to... I didn’t want to...”<br />
<br />
Jamie shook his head, forcing a small smile. “It’s okay, Tim,” he said, though his voice was still shaky. “We’ll... we’ll figure it out. The important thing is that you’re out here now. We’ll deal with the rest later.”<br />
<br />
Timmy nodded slowly, his massive shoulders slumping slightly as he tried to make himself appear smaller. But there was no hiding the reality of what he had become—a towering, muscle-bound giant whose very existence defied logic. Jamie could only hope that they would find a way to deal with Timmy’s transformation before things got even more out of control.</p>
