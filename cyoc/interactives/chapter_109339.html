<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a tense morning for The Stovall’s. With their arrival at the court house; they were assailed by several reporters. Despite being a small town; the mayor’s daughter having to enter a plea was about as newsworthy as Benton Knight’s press conference last Saturday. As soon as they left the car; Brett Smithson was with them doing what she could to keep the jackals wanting a sound bite away. Getting into the front entrance of the courthouse; all four head through the security gate. A by-product of the terrorist attack on New York and creation of homeland security; Martin, Melissa and Julie had to walk through a metal detector. While Martin and Melissa went through clean; it was Julie that let off an alarm.<br />
“Ankle monitor,” Julie states as she points to the leg showing the security the device to the officers as they approach her; “Try and strip search me and you’ll be dealing with my lawyer.” <br />
Seeing Brett Smithson present and giving the guards a look of ‘just try it, I dare you’; causes them to back off. The four head to the court room where Julie is to enter her plea and to find out if her trial will take place in juvenile court or adult court.<br />
<br />
Entering the court room; Julie notices that Benton Knight, William and Martha Anderson are present. Doing her best to ignore them she sits next to her lawyer as her parents take a seat in the gallery behind them. Jack Johnson already present just looks calm as he is going over some case notes. Confident that he will win the day; he doesn’t even bat an eye as he sees Brett Smithson.<br />
<br />
“All rise,” A bailiff announces; “for the honorable Judge Brian Flagg.”<br />
<br />
A large imposing man enters the court room from the judge’s chambers. Sporting a full beard and wild hair; Julie is almost scared that is man who could be mistaken for a homeless man on the streets of Seattle would be overseeing her trial. Brett sensing her clients nervousness; “It’s okay, the judge is a big teddy bear once you get to know him.”<br />
“Be seated,” Judge Brian states as he takes his spot and waits for the court officer to hand him the case file; reviewing the file he looks at the defense table. “Julie Stovall you are being charged with two counts of assault,” Judge Flagg looking at the list and arches an eyebrow in surprise; “and two counts of attempted violation of Statue 1A, how do you plead?”<br />
“My client pleads not guilty to all charges,” Brett answering; “Before we get into the process of bail, I would like to point out several motions that I have.” Handing the motions to the court officer, who then hands them to Judge Brian.<br />
“Motion to have Julie tried in Juvenile court and a motion to determine mental competency?” The judge looks up; “Let’s hear the arguments.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Brett Smithson was facing a tough opponent; after Jack Johnson was able to stymie her motions to have Julie tried in Juvenile court and mental competency, she pulls out one more gambit.<br />
“Then I move to have the charges against my client dismissed under violating her sixth amendment rights.”<br />
“How has Julie Stovall sixth amendment rights been violated for a speedy trial,” counters Judge Brian.<br />
“My client was arrested not yesterday but Tuesday of last week,” Brett counters; “Only now she is being asked to enter a plea of guilt or innocence. This should have been done last Wednesday. In fact the prosecutor visited my client and her family, prior to her retaining legal counsel; another violation of her rights.”<br />
<br />
Jack Johnson the town’s prosecutor sighed upon hearing Brett’s Hail Mary; it was good. It might get Julie off. Despite successfully arguing that Julie be tried as an adult; The Judge a great bear of a man and a were himself looked at Jack Johnson.<br />
“Is everything opposing council said was true,” Judge Brian in no mood for excuses; “did you visit the Stovall’s prior to their daughter retaining legal counsel?”<br />
“Yes,” Jack shaking his head; “I thought of it as a courtesy call, to a friend.”<br />
“You of all people should know better than that,” Judge Brian chastising the prosecutor; “Even Sheriff Cooper should of known better then to release her back into her parents custody. Did he inform Julie Stovall or her family as to the date of her arraignment?”<br />
“No your honor,” Jack not liking where this was going; “That was me when I visited the Stovall’s last week.”<br />
<br />
The Judge a were-grizzly did not like what he had to do; despite the evidence that will undoubtedly convict Julie, she will get off on a technicality. Sighing he begins speaking.<br />
“Very well; in light of the prosecutor’s admission I have no choice but to dismiss the assault charges against Julie Stovall on the basis of her sixth amendment rights being violated.” Looking at Julie, “however, the statue 1A charges must be deferred to the elder council. Until then Julie Stovall that ankle monitor will removed. If the council wishes to detain you they will have to do it themselves, as this court has no jurisdiction in regards to the second set of charges before you. Expect a summons from the elder council shortly young girl.” Returning his gaze at the prosecutor, “since double jeopardy applies to the assault charges, you are barred in re-filling.”<br />
<br />
The judge bangs his gavel and gets up to leave. The courts audience is stunned at what it heard. Benton Knight who was in attendance as well as William Anderson and his wife Martha; all three are confused with the result of what they hoped to be the beginning of Julie’s punishment. Only Martin and Melissa Stovall were sad at the outcome; shaking Brett Smithson’s hand for doing what she could get Julie off the charges, they ignore their daughter and mill about waiting for Brett who decided to talk to Jack Johnson.<br />
<br />
Benton approaching the Anderson’s; he was still coming to terms with his Bi-polar disorder. But after coming to a settlement of sorts with the help of Tachibana and witnessing Eric’s shift to that of a white were-panther last night during the were-panther gathering ; Benton’s attitude towards the Anderson’s have softened of late.<br />
“Look I know it’s not much,” Benton looking genuinely melancholy; “but at least our children will not have testify with what happened to them and worry about being cross examined.”<br />
“They still have to testify,” William mumbles; “where, at the elder council? Benton you were once on the council, what would be the procedure to dealing with this?”<br />
“They speak before the committee like they would in a courtroom,” Benton answering calmly; “the only difference is they would be testifying in their fursonas and it would be them and the council only. No lawyers or family for moral support.”<br />
“Will this allow Julie to be able to go back to school,” Martha in tears asking; “will her suspension soon be lifted?”<br />
“While Julie may have gotten off due to a technicality,” Benton grumbling; “the video evidence of Julie attacking our children is incontrovertible. She will be expelled. The only question is when.”<br />
<br />
Looking at his watch; Benton had to leave if he was going to make his first appointment as a patient for Frances Twist. Looking back at the Anderson, “I have to go or I’ll be late for an appointment. Just to let you know, my brother is picking Frieda up from school, Eric and Spencer as well. Apparently he needs to talk to them about some matter. He wouldn’t tell me after reading his text. I just hope his car is big enough to take them to where ever they are going to talk.”<br />
“If it’s late do you want either of use to drop Frieda off or is she going to be spending the night with us?” Martha asking.<br />
“Uhm,” Benton pausing, while he was still dealing with his wife in the hospital and Jack Crawford trying to muscle in on his company; his younger brother Lance was still someone that despite his efforts to be nice to, he still could not stand him. “If they decide to all head over to your place or Spencer’s; please be mindful that Frieda has a 9pm curfew. Unless of course Lance decides to take it upon himself to act as chauffer” Before William or Martha could answer; Benton quickly leaves the courthouse.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jack Johnson was busy putting his case files away, when Brett Smithson approach.<br />
“No hard feelings Jack,” Brett speaking; “but the sheriff and you made some error in procedures. I had to capitalize on them.”<br />
“Well there is always the possible witness intimidation charges to level against Julie,” Jack looking at the defense attorney; “you do realize Julie’s computer was seized yesterday over suspicions of her sending out emails in an attempt to intimidate Frieda Knight.”<br />
“I know,” Brett looking at the Stovall family; “I expect discovery promptly and for you and the sheriff to follow proper procedure this time if you intend to move forward.” Heading back to join her client and her family, Brett turns around to look at Jack Johnson; “and don’t attempt any bullshit with trying my client as an adult this time.”<br />
<br />
‘You are a tenacious badger, through and through;’ Jack muses to himself. Finishing putting his files in his briefcase, he looks at the Stovall family as they obviously have a heated discussion; thinking it be better not to try and overhear he leaves the court room only to be intercepted by none other than Tachibana No Akane.<br />
“Jack Johnson,” Tachibana approaching the prosecutor and handing him a  scroll with a red wax weal depicting a paw on it; “the elder council wishes a word with you. We will inform you as to when we need to talk.”<br />
Before Jack could respond, Tachibana moves past him and approaches the Stovall’s. Seeing the were-vixen hand Martin Stovall a similar scroll could only mean the same thing to Jack. ‘This has got to be in regards to Julie’s statue 1A violations.’</p>
