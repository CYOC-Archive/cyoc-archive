<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy was 24 and a sexy redhead, she also had brains. Her body was not marred by freckles, her skin was as white as milk. She also had a model&#39;s body, Amy uses them to her advantage using photo shoots to help pay her way through college. Her breasts were 35B, a large busty ginger. Amy&#39;s eyes were most startling feature, they were the same brownish-red as her hair.<br />
<br />
She had gotten an internship at a bio lab that was working on worms. Worms were essential to the progress of humanity. They did a great deal for gardens, the Chinese government was funding the research and they were more interested in splicing the DNA of worms with other animals than Western governments. <br />
<br />
They wanted a Superworm, that could produce more efficient gardens and crop yields.  Further these superworms could be new method of fishing, changing aquaculture as they knew it. As they were closing down the college lab for the semester break Amy and the Dr in charge, Singh, were leaving to see family in Sri Lanka. Singh was pregnant. With her baby bump pushing into her scrubs, her breasts were small mounds as well making a trio of dents in the fabric. Amy was in a grey t shirt, black skirt and white pumps. as they were going to be closed for several months. Her mind was on the fashion shoots she had lined up, she drew the line at lingerie. <br />
<br />
Cosmetics, coffee, clothing, whatever. She was proud of her body but she wanted no nude or near nude photos to draw attention away from her actual desire to be taken seriously as a biologist. She wanted to be like Dr Singh, at 5-2 she was slight but an attractive woman with a shock of black hair and fierce devotion to her duty. The thoughts of her future, both immediate and dreamed, distracted her from what she was doing. <br />
<br />
One of the sleek black worms was being put back into the mulch by Amy when Dr Singh left, the sound of the door slamming made her jump and the dish smashed as the worm flew into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh SHIT!&quot; she muttered.<br />
<br />
She started ripping apart the lab, checking under papers, Bunsen burners, microscopes, centrifuges, trying to find the worm. Amy was frantic as the black creature had disappeared, high over head a long black worm waited, like a mad bomber ready to explode. <br />
<br />
The worm fell. <br />
<br />
Into the gap in her cleavage. <br />
<br />
&quot;ARRGHHH!&quot; she howled.<br />
<br />
She could feel the powerful muscular &quot;Superworm&quot; moving around her body without any form of protection. Amy based her fists against her body to squash it flat, damn the internship, but it dodged her blows. It moved around her, Amy shrieked and jumped around as if her panties contained hundreds of fire ants and scorpions. Slamming into walls she tried to smash it with a body blow.<br />
<br />
The worm then moved around her belly finding a hole, it was then between her buttocks. She leaned around trying to slam her ass against the wall. It moved around her above her pubic hair and then found another hole. Oiling itself it plunged into her belly button.<br />
<br />
A feeling of an intense orgasm hit Amy as she fell to her knees, her hands on the small of her back as she started to moan deeply. Her ample chest thrust forward as she was putting on an erotic display, it was actually hormones from the worm. Dr Singh came back and watch as the show, minding her own passenger who kicked (as if lodging a formal complaint) she lifted Amy&#39;s dress showing her black thong, and the black worm halfway into her belly button. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God...&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Singh had warned them against injecting human RNA and DNA but they wouldn&#39;t listen. She tried to pull the worm out of the hole. It was super slippery, she tried to find scissors but cutting it proved only to dent the metal blade. Grabbing forceps she tried to pull it out, but the worm had slipped into Amy&#39;s belly button. <br />
<br />
Amy fell to the ground and started to jerk and wobble as if her body had been plugged into an electric chair. Her breasts wobbled so hard one broke free of the cup of her black lacy bra and then the tight buttons of her t-shirt showing she was more endowed with breasts than even a six month pregnant Dr Singh. <br />
<br />
Her long legs, she stood at 5-9, kicked in the air as the body tried to fight the intruder. Amy&#39;s moans turned into those of a person suffering some internal pain as the worm entered her intestines and then her womb and dissolved into into it&#39;s individual cells. <br />
<br />
Singh found that Amy was running a huge temperature, a sign of infection, as she burned up. The good Doctor then threw a cold pack on her head and then a bucket of ice on her topless form. Singh should have called the EMT but she knew the work here was illegal, only the company&#39;s internal medicos could be trusted. She would have to hope as the American said &quot;no blood, no foul.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t cut, but had removed her lab assistant&#39;s shirt and bra. Difficult with her own bumps and bulges. Exposing her perky breasts to the air conditioned lab. Her nipples stiffened given the coldness of the ice and the air circulating around the nipples. Otherwise she looked fine, some bruising was developing from hitting herself, her stomach was flat and toned. Slight scratch marks existed from what had entered her body, other than the bruising she looked (Singh hoped) just fine.  <br />
<br />
Deep inside Amy something started to grow.</p>
