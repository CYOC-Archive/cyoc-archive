<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Both, no wait, fuck I mean Dare. I pick Dare.&quot; panicked Jen, having misspoke in her haste to answer on time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, not so good under pressure I see. But it&#39;s already too late to change your answer, so you&#39;ll be getting both,&quot; explained Kyle.<br />
<br />
Jen, now a bit nervous, as while she didn&#39;t believe in the curse, something about this situation, and Kyle&#39;s odd confidence that it is real, was scaring her. &quot;Kyle wait, please don&#39;t do this. I&#39;m sorry. I was wrong to do that to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Jen, I almost want to believe you when you say it like that. Hmm, I&#39;ll tell you what, since of everyone involved, you are the only one to apologize to me, I&#39;ll go a little easier on you. But you are still getting both regardless, since I already asked and you answered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen sighed, knowing he was right. If this curse was actually real, then she was already well on the hook. Desperation and panic taking over, she began pleading him to go easy on her with tears in her eyes. &quot;Please just be reasonable, okay? Nothing too crazy, alright? Please Kyle. I don&#39;t want to stop being a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a pause, Kyle sighed loudly into the phone, &quot;Haaaa, fuck Jen, now you&#39;re making me feel like the asshole when you beg me in tears like that. But... fine. I did have a different idea that I guess I can give you. Now listen up. For your transformation, your pussy will become sentient, and have her own unique personality and thoughts. The two of you will be amicable, though more like sisters than lovers. Her personality will lean more dominant while you will now lean more submissive, but both of you will be able to play both roles. Every morning, including today, you and your pussy will decide who&#39;s on top for that day. And whoever wins, will gain control over the body, with your body inverting when your pussy is in control. That means that you will walk on your hands, wear clothes upside down, and will be treated as if your pussy is your head, and your mouth is your pussy. If you are inverted, you won&#39;t suffer any I&#39;ll side effects like dizziness or have blood rushing to your head. You will also have flawless balance too, and will have a special set of shoes where your thumbs are used as the heel part of your modified high heels. And when inverted, you will speak with your pussy, and your mouth will take over the physical duties of your pussy, though you wont be able to get pregnant through your mouth. Lastly, you and your pussy will be able to communicate telepathically, though once in your designated roles, you will maintain your submissivness to your pussy and vice versa. Oh, and I guess that regardless of who&#39;s on top, everyone will still consider you as being the same person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen, feeling a little better now that the transformation part was over with, silemtly waited for the dare to come. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now for your Dare, I want you to wear your shortest skirt you own, even if not school appropriate. You will never wear panties or clothing that fully cover your crotch ever again, and will often choose to go commando as its just easier. I want you to then find me at school today and sincerely apologize to me in person. After that, you will take your tits out of your top and without trying to cover yourself up, proudly keep them out for all to see. And while you won&#39;t be punished for doing this, people will take notice and often will stare at you. Oh, and for clarity sake, if your pussy is on top, then people will consider your mouth to be your pussy and will stare at it. And after today, you are free to decide on whether you cover up or show off your tits and pussy, with the both of you having your own preferences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen understood, and nothing more was said, so she hung up. Immediately, she felt her pussy come alive. &quot;Hmm, what a weird guy, though I&#39;m certainly not complaining about having a priority role now. It&#39;s good to meet you Jenny, though we already are well acquainted, at least I am with your fingers haha. I&#39;m Libby by the way,&quot; introduced her pussy while flapping her lips as if it were a mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Libby?&quot; Questioned Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s fitting for a pussy. You know, labia is kinda like Libby. Anyways, I wanna be on top for today, so why don&#39;t you go ahead and become my pussy already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, wait. But I wanna be on top.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, you&#39;ve always on top though. Can&#39;t you let me take the wheel for once?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen wanted to reply, but couldn&#39;t think of a good reason to counter with... and found herself already laying down on their bed as her vision flipped over. &quot;Thank you Jenny. I promise I&#39;ll play with you a quite lot tonight,&quot; thanked Libby as she raised their hips off the bed and stood up on their hands, with their thumbs fixed in place, permanently pointing into the floor. <br />
<br />
Walking around her room on just her thumbnails and fingers was definitely a new experience for sure, but it wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. Jen, now just a passenger in her own body, just relaxed and just let Libby do everything. Libby dressed them in Jen&#39;s micro skirt that she had bought to be sexy with her last boyfriend, and a square neck crop top, that showed off her entire ass and pussy. Her tits were just barely contained by the skirt, threatening to pop out of it at any moment, while showing off Libby&#39;s underboob cleavage, or Jen&#39;s normal cleavage extensively. <br />
<br />
Somehow, with an unbelievable amount of dexterity, Libby managed to tie Jen&#39;s hair into a perfect messy bun, keeping it from being dragged over the floor. &quot;Haha, I look like I have a tail,&quot; laughed Libby, giving Jen a little shake. Libby then moved them out if their room and slipped on their modified shoes, a pair of peep toe platform heels with the heel removed. Jens middle and ring fingers could be seen through the peep toe hole, while her thumbs took their position as the heel of the high heels.<br />
<br />
Libby then left the house after grabbing their purse and bag with her toes. She left just in time to catch the bus. People were a bit surprized to see Jen walking upside down, but  didn&#39;t make much of a fuss about it, save for how she had her pussy on full display. Libby took the open seat next to her friend Susan, and carefully lowered herself into it so that she didn&#39;t ruin her bun. She then interlocked her toes and rested them on the underside of their tits as the bus took off.<br />
<br />
Susan looked her up and down with raised eyebrows. &quot;Feeling a little bold today Jen?&quot; She asked, looking at their mouth with a curious interest. Libby laughed, &quot;I guess I am a bit. How&#39;s the view?&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan laughed and poked Jen&#39;s nose, sending a huge burst of pleasure through her body. &quot;Its cute and kinda makes me want to tease it and see you squirm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Libby let out an over-sexualized moan, then laughed when all the guys turned to face her. Jen was a little embarrassed, but was still recovering from being poked in her nose, which was now just as sensitive as her clit. Libby seemed to love the attention though, as Jen could feel her mouth starting to water with something other than saliva. She had an idea of what it was, and was relieved that she found it to taste really good. She now was curious about how it felt and tasted to go further though.</p>
