<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Freddy and Michael looked into the glass at the front door, they spotted Freddy’s parents  trying to calm down an hysterically crying Josh. Freddy and Michael stepped back as the door opened. They were met with a look of shock on Freddy’s parents faces when they spotted him as a human again. Josh continued to cry hysterically throughout this moment. <br />
<br />
“Uh Freddy” his father began. “When did you get back?”<br />
<br />
“Uh” Freddy responded, trying to think of an answer that would satisfy them. “I was at school and then I went over to see Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” Michael concurred, hoping it would be a good enough story to sell to Josh.<br />
<br />
“Then why were you at the dog park?” Josh asked as he sobbed, crushing those hopes.<br />
<br />
“And where we you Michael?” Freddy’s father asked him pointedly. “You said you’d rendezvous with us in thirty minutes and we waited over an hour for you.”<br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael responded, nervously trying to come up with an answer. “Well, Freddy had heard from his mother that the dog might be missing, so he asked me to go over to the park to help you guys look for him. Then Freddy asked me to come back as his mother would go help you guys out instead. Since I didn’t have your cell phone number, I didn’t have a way to reach you. Sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Honey, is this true?”<br />
<br />
Ignoring the question, Freddy’s mother spoke up. “Well, I’m glad you’re home, Freddy. We weren’t able to find Fido, anyway, so it was best that you came back here, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“I want Fido! I want Fido! I want Fiiiiddoooo!” Josh screamed at the top of his lungs. <br />
<br />
“Let’s get you upstairs” his father said sternly as he dragged a crying Josh up the stairs. “Besides, it wasn’t our dog to begin with. And frankly, after the shenanigans you pulled on your field trip yesterday, you didn’t even deserve to get a dog.”<br />
<br />
Josh’s crying echoed before a door upstairs opened and shut, ending the seemingly constant spew of wailing. When Josh and his father were safely out of sight, Freddy’s mother motioned the two boys into the den. When she thought that she was completely out of earshot of Josh, she spoke up. <br />
<br />
“So you changed back at the park, huh Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” he replied. “It just sort of happened.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I knew it wasn’t a good idea for them to take you there.”<br />
<br />
“Then why didn’t you stop them?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
“Because” she replied “I don’t have the strength to take the two of them head on. They are strong personalities, as you probably already know.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother motioned to him as she put a gentle hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“When you go to bed tonight, Freddy, I’m going to have a talk with your father to make sure this doesn’t happen again in the future. From now on, until the curse has been lifted, you need to stay home where we can keep an eye on you.”<br />
<br />
“While you’re at it” he replied “can you get him to stop mistreating me? It drove me absolutely crazy today to be scolded and violated like that.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll try. It wasn’t right for him to do that and I’ll make a note of it to tell him as such. Anyways, boys, it’s getting late, so I think you should go home, Michael. and you, Freddy, should go to bed.”<br />
<br />
“Alright mom” Freddy replied.<br />
<br />
“Bye Mrs. Benson” Michael added as he made his way to the front door to leave. <br />
<br />
When Michael had safely left, Freddy and his mother got ready to go to sleep for the night. It wasn’t easy, with Josh’s screaming and crying seeming to have no end, but at a not too indecent hour, it stopped as Josh passed out, exhausted by his own noise making. <br />
<br />
As Freddy showered, he was relieved to remove pieces of mud from his toes and fingernails that he hadn’t noticed before. He was also relieved to rid himself of an awful dog scent that followed him everywhere, even when he was a human. <br />
<br />
“The dog must be making its presence known” Freddy thought as he took a bar of soap to scrub himself down. “Even when I’m human, it seems to creep up. Maybe that’s why Ellie continues to be attracted to me. Or maybe she put two and two together and figured out that dog was me when I changed back.”<br />
<br />
Just as Freddy was saying this, he started to notice a tingle in his loins.<br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself. “I have to be careful not to get turned on in the shower. I don’t want to be changing into a dog again so soon. I’m going to have to refrain from masturbating for a while. It won’t be easy.”<br />
<br />
After the sensation of horniness went away, Freddy shut off the shower and dried himself off thoroughly, careful to avoid fluffing his penis up. It was such a contrast from when he was a teenage boy to when he was a dog. As a boy, he was relatively smooth, with bits of pubic and arm hair along with slight scruff on his face when he forgot to shave. As a dog, however, he was hairy as can be, with fur shedding all over the place. He noticed even tonight that there was an abundance of dog hair on the back of the couch as he sat and talked to the old man. <br />
<br />
“We need to find a way to more effectively clean this up” Freddy thought to himself as he finished drying himself off and headed to his room.<br />
<br />
When he got there, he quickly put on some pajamas and tucked himself under the covers, wary of the scent of Ellie next door leaving him with a surprise in the morning. At least he got to sleep in his own bed tonight. That was a relief.<br />
<br />
The next morning…..</p>
