<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joseph liked clowns when he was a kid, but now that he worked in a cubicle, and had a beautiful wife, he didn't have time for what he now <br />
considered &quot;kids' stuff&quot;.<br />
<br />
This was a day just like any other for him. He was busy typing up this and that, and whatever else he had to do to keep his job.<br />
<br />
He had been working for 2 hours, when one of his co-workers, Robert, came to talk with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Robert started &quot;another day at the old grind, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Joseph replied &quot;2 hours down, 6 to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really should smile once in while,&quot; Robert said &quot;It's healthy, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll smile when I'm done with these contracts.&quot; Joseph replied &quot;You should probably get back to work before the boss sees you out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, lighten up!&quot; Robert said &quot;You know what your problem is, Joseph? You take things too seriously&quot; As soon as Robert said that, his nose <br />
puffed out into a big, red ball.<br />
<br />
Joseph rubbed his eyes, then stared at him. &quot;Uh...Robert,&quot; Joseph started &quot;I don't know how to tell you this but... um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Robert said as his lips stretched out into a big, red smile &quot;you want me to get back to work, right?&quot; His skin turned white.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not it, Robert.&quot; Joseph said as Rob's hair became bald on top with bright orange, curly hair on the sides and back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what?&quot; Rob asked, as his shoes became 2 feet long.  &quot;It's just that you're...uh..&quot; Jo said as Rob got fat, his neck tie became red with white <br />
polka-dots, and he wore white gloves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Jo-Jo,&quot; he said in a goofy voice as his name tag changed from Robert to Bobby &quot;You can tell me, I'm your best buddy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what,&quot; Jo said &quot;never mind.&quot; &quot;Okie-dokie,&quot; Bobby said with a smile &quot;but just remember that when you're ready to talk about it, I'll be <br />
there for ya!&quot; He then pulled a unicycle out of his pocket and peddled away.<br />
<br />
Jo turned to Beth, a young female co-worker, who was staring after Bobby like he had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beth, did you see that?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did.&quot; she said, a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Jo said. &quot;Then I'm not crazy. Why did he just turn into a clown?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it was something he ate.&quot; she said as her nose inflated into a pink ball. &quot;It probably didn't agree with him.&quot; she said as her lips became <br />
plump and pink. &quot;I wonder what they were arguing about.&quot; she said as her skin turned white. &quot;Oh well,&quot; she smiled as her hair became pink, <br />
going into ringlets, with a big, white bow on top. &quot;It was probably nothing important.&quot; She said as her breasts doubled in size, her hips widened <br />
out, her shoes became 2 feet long and pink, her skirt popped into a pink tutu, and her name tag changed from Beth to Lizzie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lizzie, er .. Beth,&quot; he stammered &quot;You just became a clown too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee,hee,hee&quot; she giggled in a helium voice &quot;You say that like it's a bad thing, Jo-Jo. I think Bobby is right - you DO need to lighten up. <br />
Hee,hee,hee.&quot; And she cartwheeled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've gotta get out of here!&quot; he said to himself.<br />
<br />
He got his things, and ran out of the office. Everyone he saw on the way turned into silly clowns. He made it to his car when a female police <br />
officer stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; she said &quot;you haven't paid your parking meter. I'll have to issue you a fine!&quot; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said &quot;but I need to get home right now - it's an <br />
emergency!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; she said &quot;either pay up, or I'll have to -&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, ok?&quot; he said &quot;It'll never happen again. Just please let me go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said as her nose became a pink ball with glitter &quot;You look like you really didn't mean it,&quot; she said as her lips became pink &quot;so I guess <br />
I could let you off with a warning this time,&quot; as her skin turned white, blue eyeshadow appeared around her eyes, her hair became light blue <br />
going into big ponytails, her breasts and hips doubled in size, her skirt poofed into a big, flowery miniskirt, and and her shoes became 2 feet <br />
long and light blue &quot;Just try not to do it again, kay?&quot; she said in a helium voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; he said getting into the car &quot;Bye.&quot; She happily waved at him as he drove off.<br />
<br />
As he was driving, everyone he saw turned into a silly clown, and it wasn't just the people, but the buildings and the vehicles changed to to <br />
become more clownish. <br />
<br />
He got home, and shut the door behind him. He saw his wife Rachel watching the news.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; she said &quot;You're home early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind that, Rachel!&quot; he said. &quot;We have to leave town right now before we turn into clowns!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think that will do us any good.&quot; she said looking at him worriedly &quot;Why not?&quot; He asked. &quot;I've been watching the news,&quot; she said &quot;and it's <br />
happening everywhere around the world - not just here.&quot; He looked at the news and saw she was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm scared, Joseph.&quot; she said &quot;I don't want to be a clown!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be a clown either!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go to the basement and hide.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;For how long?&quot; she asked. &quot;I don't know.&quot; he said. Then his nose puffed out into a big, red ball. &quot;Oh, no!&quot; he said &quot;Not me!&quot; <br />
Rachel's nose puffed out into a pink, glitter-covered ball. &quot;It's happening to me too!&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Rachel!&quot; Jo said &quot;We have to fight it - we have to resist!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them struggled not to change anymore, but changes continued anyway.<br />
<br />
Their skin became white, Blue triangles appeared under Jo's eyes, and pink eyeshadow appeared around Rachel's eyes, and her lashes became <br />
longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urg! It's not working, Jo-Jo!&quot; she said in frustration as she covered her mouth. &quot;I... I called you Jo-Jo!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fight it, Ray-Ray.&quot; he said as his lips became bright red and hers became pink and pouty &quot;We can't lose to this!&quot;<br />
<br />
His hair turned blue and hers turned bright pink. &quot;You just called me Ray-Ray!&quot; she said as his hair curled into an afro and hers become a 70's <br />
hairstyle with a big, white bow on top, with red polka-dots. &quot;My name's not Ray-Ray, it's Ray-Ray, no, I mean Ray-Ray - no! Jo-Jo, I'm so sorry! <br />
I can't help it!&quot; She started gushing out tears. <br />
<br />
He went to comfort her &quot;It's okay Ray-Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jo-Jo,&quot; she said crying &quot;would you still love me as a clown?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you still love ME as one?&quot; he asked gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Jo-Jo,&quot; she said as their ears each became half the size of their heads &quot;I'll always love you no matter what!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I will always love you too,&quot; he said &quot;no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jo-Jo!&quot; she said sobbing as they hugged eachother, and then kissed eachother on the lips.<br />
<br />
As they were kissing, Jo-Jo became very muscular, and his clothes changed: He now wore a blue shirt with big, white frills and red pom-poms <br />
running down the front, baggy blue pants, and purple shoes 2 feet long. Ray-Ray's breasts became the size of bowling balls, her hips widened <br />
to match her breasts, and her clothes changed: She now wore a pink dress with shoulder poufs as big as her breasts, white pom-poms running <br />
down the front, a poofy dress skirt that came down to her knees, red and pink striped socks pulled up to her knees, and pink shoes 2 feet long.<br />
<br />
When they opened their eyes, they saw the house and furniture had changed to become exaggerated and clownish, and they looked at <br />
themselves, and finally eachother.<br />
<br />
They stared at eachother for 5 minuets.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is it.&quot; Jo-Jo said in a goofy voice. &quot;We're clowns now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Ray-Ray said in a helium voice &quot;but if everyone else in the world is a clown, then it's okie-dokie, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
They both smiled really big and broke into a fit of laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jo-Jo said in a goofy voice, &quot;If it makes you feel any better, you're the most beautiful clown-woman I've ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, thanks Jo-Jo,&quot; she said in a helium voice, wiping a big tear from her eye, which made a loud splash on the floor, &quot;and if it makes YOU feel <br />
any better, YOU'RE the most handsome clown-man I'VE ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shucks,&quot; he said &quot;thanks, Ray-Ray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Jo-Jo heard a car-horn sound coming from one of his pant pockets.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get this.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He took out his cell-phone. &quot;It's a text message from my boss.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it say?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He found out from Bobby and Lizzie that I left work early,&quot; he said &quot;but they told him how stressed I was, so he's giving me the rest of the day <br />
off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How nice of him.&quot; she said, relieved &quot;I guess since he must be a clown now too, he understands. So what do you want to do with the rest of the <br />
day?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything as long as it's with you, dear.&quot; he said. &quot;So what do you wanna do?&quot; she asked &quot;Drive around and see what the world outside looks <br />
like? Go out to eat? Or maybe,&quot; she said, giving him a seductive look &quot;you wanna go upstairs and get comfy under the sheets with me? I'm ready <br />
to be a mommy if you're re ready to be a daddy. So what will it be, my sweet Jo-Jo?&quot;</p>
