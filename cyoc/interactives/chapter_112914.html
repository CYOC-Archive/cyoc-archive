<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William felt quite pleased with the progress his students were making as the discussions on Shakespeare among his students was getting better and many students were beginning to put together some interesting ideas, though how good they truly were would have to wait until the students turned in their term papers before Finals Week. But still, for the moment, he felt his students were making good progress. That was good, though he did feel glad that it was the end of the day. He stepped out of the English Department building and looked out, seeing that the the sky had darkened as night settled onto Moon Lake. Yet things seemed calm and as he took a deep breath, the air smelled perfectly fresh and even natural.<br />
<br />
William enjoyed that scent and breathed it in deeply as he began his walk home from the college. He could get a ride, and a part of him wished to be at home and by Martha&#39;s side, but he couldn&#39;t deny that the &quot;scent of nature&quot; smelled good and he found himself enjoying just breathing it in. It remind him of the small walk through the woods that he and Martha had taken with the Hales. He knew there was potentially some rogue agent of Dieter Wilhelm potentially prowling the woods and potentially wanting to kill Harry Jenkins, but in a strange way, the fox in him was more than confident he could avoid serious trouble with that agent, which left William feel more content to simply enjoy the smells that came to his nose from the forested areas around the college and surrounding Moon Lake, as well as what he could see of it from the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Martha and I could go for a walk after dinner,&quot; William thought to himself as he walked along, &quot;Go to that little clearing...&quot;<br />
<br />
His thoughts being with his wife, a sign of his bond remaining as firm as ever, William simply enjoyed his quiet walk on the way home. The streets were quiet, though there were a few others walking along as he was, though they were on the other side of the street or on their lawn. William quietly waived to them and continued on his way. He eventually came up on his own home, though he noticed another car parked out on the street in front of the Anderson home. He also noticed that the lights on the ground floor appeared to be out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha must have brought home a friend,&quot; William surmised and moved to check his phone. He couldn&#39;t answer his phone during class and if class activity kept him busy, he wouldn&#39;t be able to actually check for any texts when they arrived, and he had had enough work to pay attention to that he couldn&#39;t check his phone between classes. He pulled out his phone as he reached the front door and there was a text that had come from Martha. It effectively let him know that Martha had had a very good day and made a very good impression on the head coach. The message explained that &quot;Kat&quot; was a lesbian but didn&#39;t mention that &quot;Kat&quot; was a weretigress.<br />
<br />
He made his way inside and turned on the light in the living room to relax for a few moments and let his have her fun, as per their agreement. He could hear some moaning coming faintly from the upstairs area, which indicated that the two women were still at it. William wasn&#39;t going to interfere in anything that he wouldn&#39;t get an opportunity to join in and contented himself to watching a little television to relax before getting his chance to talk to Martha. However, his plans were cut short when a very loud noise echoed through the house. It was a roar, and a loud one.<br />
<br />
&quot;AARRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing that was the orgasmic roar of a weretigress, William was quick to his feet and standing in front of the couch and then looking upward toward the stairs. He knew that that sounded like something big, like the roar of a big cat. And while he might not be good with many of the science things that his youngest son was, he knew enough enough to know that big cats could be dangerous. And while he had learned enough that weres were tough to kill, that didn&#39;t mean that they were completely immune to danger, be it Ben Twist&#39;s birth parents being killed in a car accident or Akane Tachibana&#39;s husband&#39;s death in World War Two under the atomic bomb. Weres could be killed, and that roar had given William the fear that some big cat had escaped a zoo and gotten into the house to kill Martha. That lead to one response...<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha!&quot; William called, his voice nervous and frantic, &quot;Martha are you okay!?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a stupid question to ask if one felt that his significant other was fighting for her life against a creature that was far bigger than either William or Martha were, even their were-forms. If William&#39;s fears were true, Martha surely wouldn&#39;t be fine and would have taken some wound against the big cat. However, it was also the sort of question that was quick to come about to worry about a loved one and the only thing that was going through William&#39;s mind was his wife&#39;s safety. He rushed up the stairs with the intent on getting to his bedroom and driving off this big cat that had come to attack his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on, Martha!&quot; William called out as made it to the door and rushed into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
His arrival presented a different sort of situation. There was a big cat there, but clearly a were based on generous bosom and wide and more human-like hips. She was a weretigress with William&#39;s brown furred werecat wife and the two of them presently naked and smelling of sex. The three looked to each other calmly and quietly after a few moments as no one said anything for a moment. When William did speak, it was slow and somewhat embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... uh... hello,&quot; William spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Kat said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will... you did...&quot; Martha began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did get your text, but it...&quot; William answered as tried to move his eyes away from Kat and Martha together, &quot;but it didn&#39;t say that you were with a weretigress. I thought some random animal had broke in and was attacking you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve never heard a weretiger roar in pleasure?&quot; Kat gave teasing chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; William answered, &quot;We&#39;ve all only become weres recently. We haven&#39;t had time to know the specific &quot;calls&quot; of every were species. And I couldn&#39;t stand by and let my wife be hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can rest assured that I would never harm her, especially after the pleasure we shared together,&quot; Kat gave a sigh and looked over to Martha. A part of her was fairly willing to have some more fun, but with William&#39;s return and mistaking a pleasure filled roar for an aggressive one and deciding to come to the &quot;rescue,&quot; that mood was pretty much dead. It wasn&#39;t that William was bad looking. As any other male werefox was built, even with all his clothes on, he looked like he could double as a male model,  but as a lesbian... that really didn&#39;t excite her in anyway. She could recognize that William was handsome, but that didn&#39;t mean that that did anything for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; William answered and backed away toward the door, &quot;Ummmm... I... I should go...&quot;<br />
<br />
He mentally kicked himself as he left while Kat looked to a nearby clock. She sighed as she looked to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d probably need to get going too,&quot; Kat sighed, &quot;get my own dinner ready and make sure I&#39;m caught up for tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could stay for dinner here... it&#39;d be leftovers, but... it&#39;d let you and William get off to a better foot than...&quot; Martha commented, &quot;well, better than him thinking I was in danger and coming to the rescue when no rescue was needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;d be fine with that?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he would,&quot; Martha told her, &quot;He knows our marriage is presently open. The incident here is more an issue of being awkward rather than anything else. Don&#39;t worry. Everything will be fine.&quot;</p>
