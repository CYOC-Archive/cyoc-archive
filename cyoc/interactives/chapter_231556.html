<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiko smirked as she watched Amanda rant and rail at some moldy looking statue in the decrepit and rundown building that looked like a church. At least that is what she choice to believe; however watching the tail end of Lighting’s transformation to that of a Centaur. The Japanese American would have not believed it but seeing is believing as her elders once said. So watching the rather handsome looking half human, half horse creature rest on the floor as he breathed deeply; passed out from the transformation, she felt a stirring in her. A heat welling from within; it was comparable to feeling aroused at the sight of a toned athletic male body. The sight of well-defined muscles chiseled abs and a confident looking physique; Aiko was wondering if she was feeling a form of attraction to Lightning when her thoughts of being plowed and bred from behind were broken.<br />
<br />
“Well, Amanda screaming at the statue of Epona; “what are you waiting for? Change me!”<br />
Silence was all that returned in reply; Lightning&#39;s steady breathing as he still lay unconscious was the only sound breaking the silence.<br />
“Guess the bitch is tired with transforming us into freaks,” Aiko scoffs at the statue as she turned to leave. Believing that the fun is over she manages a single step before she stops. A pained expression grows on her face as she suddenly leans forward; grabbing what could be described as the back of a pew for support; Aiko tries to fight back a gut wrenching scream as her legs rapidly bulk up destroying the tough denim jeans she was wearing. She winced at the sight of her candy cane stripped panties also fall to the ground in tatters, leaving her naked from the waist down to her newly formed blackened hooves. Her further embarrassment and sudden nudity was further compounded by a sudden urge to urinate right there in the church.<br />
<br />
“Fuck” Aiko gasped in between spurts of pain; shocked that she just peed in front on every one and unable to stop let alone run away to hide. “I have hooves?”<br />
“Looks like Epona chose which human will follow Lightning,” Bolt comments as he followed the group to the church.<br />
“But why is Aiko gasping and creaming in pain?” Sam looking on is shocked; watching as Akio rapidly grows her legs morphing into the hind legs of a horse while another pair quickly grow to help her stand on her new frame. The sound of bones snapping and crunching making those cringe in discomfort. Sam watched as Aiko stumbled and fell to her side, landing on the pee soaked floor. Mottled white and brown fur starts to cover her new equine half. A mane of raven black hair grows from her still human back as a matching tail grows from the nub above her new equine sex.<br />
<br />
“Espona is punishing her for her blasphemy,” Lighting waking up; “our goddess does not take kindly to being called rude names.” Lighting gingerly stand up on his hooves still a little shaky from his change; giving a nod and a kind smile to Bolt as he helps him up.<br />
“Amanda,” Lighting watching Aiko pass out after her ear take on a more equine shape; “Espona is also a little miffed at you for your outburst. Fortunately she understands your frustration at not changing, but asks for you to be patient. If you could all follow me to the village square.”<br />
<br />
It took some time for everyone to congregate at the center. Some didn’t want to be with others and a few just wanted to sit next to the communal fire and quietly eat the wild game that was caught earlier. Eventually everyone showed up; while the horses from Ben’s team did not speak yet, they seemed to understand that a meeting was happening and they should hear what was about to be said. As Amanda sat on a stump turned into a make shift seat, she felt a comforting hand on her shoulder, looking up she sees Chris standing behind her as he too joins the gathering but had a plate in his other hand. Amanda must have surmised that her boyfriend grabbed a second help after witnessing Aiko’s change and leaving the church. Lighting was about to speak when both Lucy and Ben showed up. Amanda just rolled her eyes as Ben saunters next to Lucy. He clearly changed and was displaying a large equine phallus flopping lazily from his sheath.<br />
“You couldn’t wait to mount Lucy until later,” someone commented as Ben embraces Lucy as the two centaurs stand to Amanda’s left.<br />
“My only regret is our feverish rut caused Ben’s glasses to get crushed under our hooves,” Lucy smiling; still feeling the massive load of Ben’s seed sloshing deep in her. A part of her couldn’t wait to go into estrus so Ben can put a foal in her. However, she was currently satisfied with her first time mating like an horse and felt no further need to expand her comment.<br />
“I should be devastated at loosing my glasses,” Ben speaking with more confidence; gone the stutter and the shy socially adverse boy. Now a proud and confident looking centaur stallion, “but becoming a centaur fixed my astigmatism. I now have excellent vision.”<br />
“Can we get this over with,” Aiko looking sullen as she spoke; still looking worn out from her transformation. She was feeling sore, as if every muscle and bone in her body ached from an extreme workout. However her sullen expression was more due to also having a chat with Espona during her short post transformation nap. It was a conversation that was akin to a parent admonishing their child form doing something bad.<br />
<br />
“Espona spoke to me in a dream after I passed out from my transformation,” Lighting spoke. Pausing to see if anyone would chime in before continuing with his speech.<br />
“She wants to repopulate this world with Centaurs.”<br />
“We already know that,” Chris commented; munching on another plate of food, he and a few others who recently transformed felt extremely hungry after they woke up from a brief spell of unconsciousness that follows. “A plague wiped out the previous group. I would like to know if there is a chance that plague could come back and take us out.”<br />
“The death of the previous centaurs ensured the disease died out as well,” Snow responded; “we should be safe.”<br />
“Apart from what we may have brought with us,” one of Chris’s group shouts; “what if a version of the common cold, measles or maybe Covid came with us? Perhaps these transformations will mutate the viruses I mentioned and make us susceptible?”<br />
“Espona’s magic,” Lighting answering; “has made sure no such illnesses came with us. Espona told me that we are the first group,” Lightning continuing; “we will not be that last. They are other abandoned villages.”<br />
“Shit,” Chris shaking his head; “did the goddess tell you how long it has been between us and the previous inhabitants?”<br />
“Too long,” Lighting answering; “She almost gave up until her paintings were rediscovered. The more there are of us,” Lightning looking at the centaurs that have changed in both body and mind before turning his gaze towards the halflings that have yet to fully change; “the greater her power to pull more humans and horses from Earth to here.”<br />
“Where is here,” Amanda feeling mentally drained; wanting to lay her head and sleep preferably naked and next to Chris in one of the available bungalows. &quot;Because it is clearly not Oz.&quot;<br />
“She calls this world,” Lightning looking at his former mistress now a soon to be mare in the growing Haras; “Questria. She created it at the same time the other Gods created their respective realms.&quot;</p>
