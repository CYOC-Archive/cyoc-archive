<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, Pedro couldn&#39;t tell that anything was happening. Some more laughing and pointing stirred up, but he decided they were laughing at the old man and his magic words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, you think your weird chanting can scare me off? Why don&#39;t you come down here and --&quot;<br />
<br />
Pedro&#39;s boasting was interrupted when he felt something touch the ground. He looked down and saw a long skin-colored rope-like thing dangling on the ground from somewhere back behind his balls. His eyes widened.<br />
<br />
He reached down, grabbed it where it touched the ground, pulled it up between his legs and held it out in front of himself with both hands. The sensation of palms raced up his spine and he had to face the fact that it was all him down there. Pedro&#39;s heart picked up speed upon noticing that his hands were no longer as close to the tip as they were a moment ago. It got even longer until he felt the thing bend and watched it sag down in front of him -- damn, this thing was still growing! His reached for the end trying to keep up with all the new sections that were blossoming into existence. Eventually it got so long that the middle part was dragging the ground even has he held the tip up in front of his face. This thing was longer than his freaking torso, and he could feel every inch of it! He just gawked for a while with his mouth hanging open.<br />
<br />
The old man didn&#39;t say a word. He just smirked and let Pedro explore his long hairless tail while the crowed snickered. Pedro looked up and blushed. He wanted to hide himself, but his clothes were gone. Pedro should have learned his lesson to be more diplomatic with powerful elders, but well-practiced defense mechanisms die hard, and as always, Pedro&#39;s sense of insecurity and humiliation boiled up into a rage inside him. He threw his tail down onto the sidewalk as hard as he could, tried not to flinch, pointed at the old man, and said in the most threatening voice he could muster:<br />
<br />
&quot;You better put things back to normal, old man. This is your last warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man chuckled slightly at the obvious bluff and watched Pedro flinch at the next sensation to tear through his consciousness. New hairs were sprouting from his face, and they weren&#39;t regular hairs either. They were long, strong, and sensitive: animal whiskers. He immediately discovered that he could wave them around like antennae. He ran his fingers gently across them as they twitched, dazed by the feelings he was getting. He was snapped out of it this time by someone pulling his tail. He screamed and looked around to his friend who was laughing. &quot;Fuck you,&quot; Pedro said and shoved the shoved his fellow bully onto the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dude, look at your legs,&quot; the dude said pointing at Pedro&#39;s legs. Pedro saw they were covered in brown fur that was spreading up his abdomen. This can&#39;t be happening to me, it washed up over his arms and face. He looked pleadingly up at the old man and finally decided to apologize and try to talk his way out of this, but it was to late: Pedro opened his mouth and horrible squeak came out!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, look at his big ears!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pedro reached up and felt the giant earlobes sticking out beside his face. His earlobes also felt the unnerving touch of the pads and claws which adorned his new hands. Pedro squeaked louder and watched helplessly as everyone started to look bigger around him. I&#39;m shrinking, he thought, feeling his face start to push out in front of him. He wrapped his hands over his growing snout until he was forced to go down on all fours. Pedro was the size of a small dog when his animal-like nose kicked in and flooded him with smells from all around him. At first, it was a confusing jumble, and then he instinctively became terrified of the plethora of human smells surrounding him. At last, Pedro was left as nothing but a scared little mouse, so small the sidewalk looked like a big cement meadow. It was very disorienting! He moved around sniffing and whisking trying to get a sense of his surroundings, but the mocking of the crowd was booming in his sensitive rodent ears. The world went dark around him as he blacked out.<br />
<br />
Pedro did not know that it was the old man who made him unconscious so he would not run away. The old man picked him up, made the crowd forget what they saw, and carried him over to Alberto.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s a cage for him, Alberto. He will wake up soon. Take him home and watch after him as your very own pet for the next week. When he comes back to normal, I have a feeling he will be a differently mannered brother than before.&quot;</p>
