<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, well, since you&#39;re a........cow now,&quot; he stuttered, &quot;would you wanna eat some feed? Or.......&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm....&quot; Jade said. She hesitated for a few moments. &quot;I mean, maybe I can. Well, can a normal salad even fit my appetite?&quot; she chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, alright then.&quot; Mark said. <br />
<br />
He stood up and started walking towards the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you gonna come with me, or are you just gonna wait here until your food&#39;s ready?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll just wait here, thanks Mark.&quot; says Jade. <br />
<br />
Mark nodded and went outside to the front door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just come outside if you need me for, uh, anything really. I won&#39;t close the door, so you&#39;ll be able to come out.&quot; He says, exit<br />
<br />
Jade was sort of relieved that she was alone again. She knew almost nothing about animals, and definitely not cows. She looked at her new body. All of this was strange to her. She shifted positions and laid on her side, seeing her new proportions. <br />
<br />
Jade was still scared, though. &#39;What If I never change back? What if anyone sees me like this? What will my parents think!?&#39; she thought to herself. The thoughts made her anxious. How did she even get to this form anyway? Everything is moving so quickly. <br />
<br />
One day, you sit outside with your husband, eating hotdogs, and the next, your a god-damn dairy cow! She took a deep breath. <br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay. Me and Mark will get through this.&#39; she says in her head. <br />
<br />
After that, she lost her train of thought. Her feelings got too intense that she didn&#39;t want to think about it anymore. She guessed she just had to just deal with it, for now. <br />
<br />
She continued looking at her body. She looked at her tail as it wagged above her backside like a metronome when a person plays music. <br />
<br />
Another sensation she could feel was the pressure building up inside her udder. It had started to fill up with milk, just like her breasts started to do a few months ago. Usually, this problem was solved with her breast pump, but she wasn&#39;t sure it would fit her four, huge teats. speaking of which, she had four nipples now, great. That meant more milk to give, she guessed. <br />
<br />
It was stressful enough when your breasts would fill up with milk, now you have to endure 2x that! <br />
<br />
Though the milk quantity she was holding now seemed a lot, there was still a good amount of space in her udder. <br />
<br />
&#39;Okay, this is getting a bit weird.&#39; she thinks to herself. She gets up and off of the blanketed floor, and tries to compensate with her new features.<br />
<br />
She sighs, as the pressure in her udder reduces, causing her less pain and less worry about it. She decides that she wants to go check on Mark if the food was ready. <br />
<br />
She carefully exits the front door, careful not to scrape her huge belly. She walks over to the back fields where the cattle are kept. Out behind the house, there was a shed where all the feed were stored. The farm wasn&#39;t as big, so there weren&#39;t many cows. That didn&#39;t stop Mark from creating a whole plantation of hay all by himself. <br />
<br />
The hay was usually stored out back for the cows to eat most of the time. He assumed this was enough for Jade to eat, since he didn&#39;t know what diet she preferred yet. <br />
<br />
As Jade continued walking, she could see Mark putting hay inside an extra trough he had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mark!&quot; Jade yelled, trying to get his attention. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, Mark looked over and waved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jade!&quot; he yelled, too. &quot;Food&#39;s ready over here!&quot; pointing to the batch of hay.<br />
<br />
Jade started walking again towards Mark. <br />
<br />
Mark used his pitchfork to put in the last bits of hay, as Jade slowly trotted over to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hon.&quot; Mark said, seemingly out of breath. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe how tiring is to move all that hay to one place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark stretched. &quot;Anyway, your food&#39;s out on the trough.&quot; he said. &quot;Anyways, I missed the other cows&#39; milking, so, I&#39;ll just leave you here, &#39;kay Jade?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah sure.&quot; Jade said calmly.<br />
<br />
Mark, again, walked away from Jaidas and headed to wards the cow pens. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in a bit, hon!&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
Jade walked up to the troughs. There were 2 sections for it, one containing water and the other containing the hay. Jade moved her head over to the food trough. Her nostrils opened wide as she took a breath. The hay smelled.....decent, enough. It was quite bland though. her human mind was thinking about adding something to make it taste better. <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it&#39;s just hay. Hay isn&#39;t supposed to be that good, anyways. It&#39;s not like she&#39;s ever eaten hay, heavens no, it&#39;s just a little bland for her likings. <br />
<br />
&#39;Whatever.&#39; she says in her head. <br />
<br />
She opens her mouth and takes a bit off of the pile of hay. It didn&#39;t taste too good in her mouth, but not that bad either. Her gums and tongue have became durable enough that she could withstand eating the rough edges of the hay.<br />
<br />
Her teeth ground the hay up into tiny, mushy bits. Then she swallowed. Not too bad. Or so, at first.<br />
<br />
Jade was glad that she was finally eating, after hours spent in this wretched body. As she continues eating, her stomach starts forcing the hay back up her throat. Jade didn&#39;t know what to do.<br />
<br />
She regurgitates the swallowed again, and instinctively started to chew. Jade continued doing so as she continued to eat. <br />
<br />
Eat, Swallow, Regorge, and Eat again. <br />
<br />
A pretty weird process, (As of all of her new features), but still manageable. <br />
<br />
&#39;Man, I have got to get used to being like this.&#39; she thinks to herself. &#39;Oh god, I hope I&#39;m not like this for the rest of my life.&#39; <br />
<br />
The annoying thing, though, was her cowbell. The thing that made her this way. She despised it being on her body, and now, it&#39;s annoying her even more. The constant clanging on her ears was enough to drive her mad, but she kept her cool<br />
<br />
This went on for about an hour, as she chewed up the last bits of hay, and swallowed. She was pretty full by then, even though her stomach<br />
<br />
At this point, she couldn&#39;t ignore the feeling of her udder. It throbbed between her legs, as the skin felt stretched and pressurized. She moved her head over to the water trough and took a sip. Her long muzzle made it so that moving her head to the water would be easier. <br />
<br />
Her udder was getting heavier by the minute, as the walls of her udder slosh with the creamy milk inside. <br />
<br />
At least she knew one thing about cows. They produce a ton of milk per day. She remembered Mark telling her that a single cow can produce up to about 8.5 gallons per day. <br />
<br />
Great.<br />
<br />
When she was completely done eating, her udder was desperate to be emptied. She laid down on the grass. <br />
<br />
She spread her legs wide, as even the slightest touch would make her teats drip. <br />
<br />
It was a sensitive feeling, like when she would touch her erect nipples. except this time, they&#39;re always erect, and now bloated with a pressurized liquid. <br />
<br />
When milk formed in her breasts, it wasn&#39;t that bad. She immediately though of attaching her breast pump to one of her teats. <br />
<br />
As she laid down, she also felt tiny kicks coming from her belly. This was the very first time that she actually felt anything inside there. She was surprised. Though, whether or not the baby would be a human or cow was a terrifying thought for her, so she just ignored it for now. <br />
<br />
Soon after, Mark came back, walking, with a hand towel on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Jane stood up as she notices his presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just finished milking the cows.&quot; He says. &quot;How was the Hay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was.......okay.&quot; Jade replied. &quot;Pretty bland, but enough to fill me up, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was glad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, just tell me if you need a diet change or not, since the hay is pretty unhealthy alone.&quot; He said. &quot;But I&#39;m glad the hay was enough to fill up your hunger needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade sighed. &quot;Well, my stomach&#39;s not the only thing filled up.&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
She slowly opens her legs wider, so her udder would be more visible. Sure enough, Mark saw it, and his Jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my......&quot; he says.</p>
