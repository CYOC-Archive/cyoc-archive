<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec looked around the camp as the fuzzy thoughts in his brain scattered from the realization of new scents, the feeling of his new borrowed body, and how everything was out of focus. Deep inside, he knew this was exhaustion but it wasn’t enough to cripple this body. The axe in his tight thick hands swayed along as he walked, not knowing where to go. <br />
<br />
The thought of finding female minotaurs to milk continued to slip away from his head with the storm of other thoughts bombarding him. Where should he go to find them? Was he supposed to go home to a wife he could milk? How would he find this body’s house? So many yet none of them stayed in his head long enough for him to notice that he had instinctively walked to the camp’s center, multiple paths laid out for him to choose. <br />
<br />
He could see the thatched roofs crafted with fine workmanship, making sure they were waterproof. The minotaurs were living in a state of it being a village and also a town. The buildings were built of thick logs cut with heavy swings from an axe. One that he was holding with just one hand. Their strength was impressive, and Alec had the urge to flex his dominant arm.<br />
<br />
Alec looked around seeing not many other minotaurs in his sight. Even then, the ones he saw were obviously male. Their signature musculature and height, with how brutish they look. Standing in front of houses with their imposing figure, taking a stance for whoever was inside the dimly lit huts.<br />
<br />
His eyes widened in awareness that he probably looked the same standing in the middle of the road. Somewhere in his head clicked and he also realized that he couldn’t use his Possession power to exit this body as well, else this body become aware something happened and raise the alarm in this already high-alert Minotaur Valley. He’d have to play along as this body’s identity and manually milk a female minotaur. <br />
<br />
Was there a brothel he could visit tonight? The huts looked the same everywhere he looked. None of them were given a sign or house number. He breathed to sigh yet then becoming aware that the minotaurs might largely use scent to mark locations… <br />
<br />
Alec was stuck. Inside a territory he doesn&#39;t know and having no access to the body&#39;s mind. The only thing he could do… was let the body do the remembering. Turning off his mind, he began walking and continued supplying his borrowed body with much needed oxygen and scents. It would know where to go.<br />
<br />
It was night, many of the minotaurs were asleep while some patrolled the roads. Alec hoped the body he was possessing had a wife he could milk a bucket of. The idea of milking, hell, fucking a cow wife of the body felt wrong, but the shame was quickly deepened when his large girth under his kilt chubbed up to his thoughts.<br />
<br />
It did give him some hope that maybe this body does have a wife! He let the exhausted body walk for him, turning off his brain from interrupting which he found was too easy to do. His thoughts barely went through his head, walking through molasses just to be lost before it was pondered on.<br />
<br />
After walking beside a big hut with what he could see was the armory, his body pushed open a door to a smaller hut and walked inside. The interior had nothing of note, a big hay bed on the floor, a weapons rack, a pail for water from the well he passed by without much awareness of it. He racked his axe, got naked as his armor was hung on a hook nearby and laid on his bed.<br />
<br />
The exhaustion was affecting his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember what he should be doing. Something about milk? His hoofed and thick fingers went down to his chubbed up cock, rubbing it slowly. He had been stuck at the idea of milking, this was what he was going to do right?<br />
<br />
Sensually, he started to administer more love to his iron rod. Pre-cum was slowly leaking out of his cock tip and lubing up his musky tool. Grunting when his balls shook to cum already, edging himself to a point. <br />
<br />
He grunted at the feeling. This felt good! It&#39;s been so long since he got to jerk himself off like a true male! He vaguely recalled cumming like crazy sometime in the past few days, but the sensation was similar to his own so might be just him and his bull-cock! He hadn&#39;t spewed his load for three days, and this body certainly felt like it hadn&#39;t for the same time or more, who knows.<br />
<br />
Grunting gutturally from the sensations of his masterful rubbing, his balls clenching and squeezing as he came, yellowish musky cum splattering all over his chin and throat as the hose splurged its contents onto his body. Warm cum, exhaustion, and fapping shutting down his brain and body as darkness claimed him. For a second, Alec was unsure if he should be doing something else. Sleep quickly overtook him as he faded into dreamland. </p>
<hr/><h3>
How long until Alec as this heifer wakes up?</h3>
