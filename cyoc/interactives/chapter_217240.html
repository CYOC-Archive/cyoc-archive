<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Brotyn thought about what he should do next, a girl had just woken up. Chastity. <br />
<br />
The girl yawned, and then checked her texts. She frowned. Some weirdo called <i>Brotyn</i> had just texted her. Momentarily distracting her.<br />
<br />
From her dream she had last night.<br />
<br />
Chastity blinked as she recalled it. She stopped and sat on the stairs as she remembered the weird dream that she just had. It was especially bizarre because normally, she never remembered her dreams.<br />
<br />
But Chastity did remember a feeling of dread last night. Her head buzzed as she laid down in her bed. As soon as she closed her eyes, she couldn&#39;t move her arms and legs. She remembered hearing a rushing sound in her mind, and then she was in a void. The girl strongly remembered feeling panicked as she lingered in that inky black space, unable to move. No matter how much she struggled. <br />
<br />
Until the animals showed up.<br />
<br />
Chastity finally eased up and calmed down once spirit animals circled around her. It felt good. Like they were watching over her. One animal in particular, took a fancy to her.<br />
<br />
A goat. <br />
<br />
A scruffy billy goat with white fur, big horns, and bright yellow eyes with slitted pupils.<br />
<br />
The goat went over to Chastity&#39;s supine form, and then sat down on her chest. He was heavy, but she couldn&#39;t do a thing about it as he laid on her. Looking down at her, straight into her eyes.<br />
<br />
Chastity couldn&#39;t look away.<br />
She didn&#39;t want to look away.<br />
<br />
Those eyes were so golden, so warm, so all-encompassing. <br />
<br />
The pair stared at each other for a while, and Chastity offered the goat a weak smile. Taking this as an invitation, the goat leaned its scruffy, shaggy head forward and gently nuzzled against her face. Especially against her chin. Soft, thick white fur tickled her there. It felt good and she liked it.<br />
<br />
The last thing Chastity remembered was the goat gently and affectionately licking her face with its warm tongue as it faded into her.<br />
<br />
That dream was so fucking weird. She shook her head and brushed her snow-white hair out of her vision. She pulled out her phone and looked at her texts again. She still didn&#39;t know who Brotyn was, but the name felt increasingly familiar to her.<br />
<br />
Chastity scratched her chin, and she tried to remember if she knew any Brotyns. She rubbed the soft peachfuzz that had grown on her chin, lost in thought.<br />
<br />
Nope, she was drawing blanks. She shrugged, and drew herself up to her new height of 5&#39;5. She&#39;d figure this out later. Or not. Her stomach was rumbling. <br />
<br />
Chastity finished her trek down the stairs, and she scratched the thick white hairs on her chin as she thought about what she should have for breakfast. Eggs? Toast? Bacon?<br />
<br />
All of that takes too much time. Chastity was too hungry to cook.<br />
<br />
She reached for some cereal and started munching away. She didn&#39;t even bother pouring the cereal into a bowl, she was eating straight from the box. <br />
<br />
Chastity was too busy chewing and savoring the grain-y, sweet flavor of her breakfast to notice her body rippling and changing. Like an image on a phone camera coming into focus. <br />
<br />
Chastity&#39;s figure toned up. Her shoulders were broader now. Soft, delicate arms gathered lean muscle. Her legs became strong and stocky. Her feminine fingers became stubbier, and the manicured tips were chewed down now. Practically the only thing about her that remained the same was her soft, pillowy butt.<br />
<br />
After she finished up her breakfast, Chastity got up and stretched. She was even taller than before, and her PJs had changed into an angora sweater with yoga pants and sneakers. She wasn&#39;t wearing a bra anymore, it was like her lingerie had evaporated into nothingness. But who needs a bra when you have a flat, toned chest?<br />
<br />
Chastity felt a strange urge coming over her, an urge that was becoming increasingly uncommon among the world&#39;s population. The urge to read. She climbed up the stairs again, the feat completely effortless in her stronger body.<br />
<br />
Stepping into her room, Chastity smiled at the sight before her. Books everywhere. All around her. Her thicker fingers danced around the spines of various books, and she smiled. Ah, occult literature. Her favorite!<br />
<br />
Guy Oak Arch&#39;s <i>The Occulted Teachings of all Ages</i> always hit the spot. She sat down on her bed and started to read. Not noticing her yoga pants silently make an opening for a bushy, white-furred goat&#39;s tail. Her new appendage wagged back and forth as read about esoteric and occult traditions. <br />
<br />
Eventually, though, a pressure hit Chastity&#39;s stomach...or lower body. It felt weird. Did she get food poisoning? Was something wrong with her? <br />
<br />
Her dark toenails clacked against the laminated wooden floor as she went to the bathroom. And then immediately smiled at her reflection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good, Chaz!&quot; He sniggered to himself, before the treble of his laughter shifted into a bleating sound. The dude leaned forward and smiled at his reflection. At his golden-hazel eyes, his shaggy and unbrushed white hair, and his handsomely thick goatee that dangled a few inches past his chin. <br />
<br />
Everything felt good. No, better than good. Chaz just couldn&#39;t remember a day as marvelous as this one. He tugged on his pants with his dark-nailed hands and smiled at his 20-inch pride and joy. His orange-sized balls were already covered in a dense coat of velvety white fuzz. It was impossible to see the skin underneath.<br />
<br />
Of course, Chaz couldn&#39;t keep a hand off his balls. They were so warm, so fuzzy. As one hand gripped his dick while he pissed, the other hand pondered his plump orbs. They felt right. He couldn&#39;t imagine living without those tender, heavy testicles. He loved the way they felt. He loved how they sagged a little from their weight. That wasn&#39;t the only thing that was good about his morning, though.<br />
<br />
For some reason, it felt good to piss while standing up. Especially good today. Like it was satisfying in a transgressive sense. Like it was solidifying a presence or something inside of him. Like he was asserting himself somehow. Actualizing. Which was kinda weird because Chaz always pissed while standing up. As far as he was concerned, this was just an ordinary day with his ordinary habits. <br />
<br />
After washing his hands, the 6&#39;0 dude felt great. Chaz knew it was time for more reading, and his goat tail wagged in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Chaz felt satisfied and content as he plopped down on his bed and started to read a grimoire. It was always interesting to read these things. To see the historical perspective. To learn about other belief systems. It wasn&#39;t real of course...<br />
<br />
As soon as he thought those words, his head ached and throbbed. He put down his book and rested on his back, groaning a little. What had come over him? His head was killing him. Two points, each one at his temples, felt like white-hot pokers being jammed into his head. They were throbbing. He couldn&#39;t take it...<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as they started, the aches went away. Leaving behind no traces of pain, but leaving something else behind.<br />
<br />
Horns. Two big onyx horns, gently curling like a Baphomet. Each one three feet long, gently curling. Himesh felt them, and grinned. He loved his horns. His massive, virile horns. Now, what was he doing again? Oh yes, reading his grimoire. <br />
<br />
It was always nice to catch up on your magic.<br />
<br />
Himesh knew magic was real. He had witnessed it. He had practiced it, even. Sure, he was just an amateur, a hedge-mage, but he was growing in aptitude with each passing day. Like something was guiding him to greater heights of arcane mastery.<br />
<br />
Himesh leaned forward and analyzed a particularly difficult sigil he was trying to memorize for a thaumaturgical ritual, and his hazel eyes turned gold with slitted pupils. He felt like he was on the verge of a breakthrough. If he could just understand what he was reading, understand how to reach the next level...<br />
<br />
He was so engrossed in his studies that he didn&#39;t notice a dense pelt of snow-white fur growing in. Nor did he notice his shaggy hair reform itself into a massive mane of dreadlocks. Each dred braided and interwoven with magical charms and trinkets that only he knew the significance of.<br />
<br />
Himesh closed the grimoire and went for a more advanced tome. He wanted to read something a bit more challenging. Sure, this book was written in archaic Latin, but that&#39;s where the fun was. He continued to read, stroking his goatee as he did. Each tug, each pull of his facial hair dragged it further downwards. In no time at all, Himesh had a braided goatee that was three feet long. And no, he wasn’t going to shave it or trim it for you.<br />
<br />
Why should he? Himesh loved who he was, and how he looked. His caprine snout, his sinister golden eyes, his white fur, his black hooves, his goatee, his dreadlocks. He was content with whom he was, like this is who he was always meant to be. Any suggestion to the contrary, would surely make Himesh send you a withering glare, maybe even a hex if he was feeling extra. Hextra.<br />
<br />
Himesh bleated at his own joke, his voice deep and masculine as he got up and stretched, reaching his full height of 6&#39;7. His hooves clacked on the floor, a familiar and reassuring sound. He grabbed his phone, and tapped on the screen with his wide, dark-tipped nails.<br />
<br />
Himesh: Brotyn, I had a weird dream too. Want to talk about it?<br />
<br />
Akius tilted his head as he studied Himesh. Had been studying Himesh. Chastity had taken to her spirit animal well. Very well. The caprine he-goat didn&#39;t seem to notice his spying, though given his burgeoning magic it may be a prudent move to spy on someone else before he overplayed his hand.</p>
