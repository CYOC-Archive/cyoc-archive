<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He began to check himself out in a full length mirror used for putting on uniforms and marveled at the beast of a man he had become. His neck now looked like it didn&#39;t exist, just shoulder and traps that swelled to Bull like pride. His shoulders and chest were wider then the double doors going to the field now, and as he tried to turn his neck, he just barely saw the wings panned back, which looked like it belonged on a cartoon. He waddled around a little, his massive bulk forcing him to only be able to make small steps, and saw his formed midsection was flopping over his waste. But his thighs had to make him at least a 55 waste. Finally he looked down to his calves that were double the size of the balk he was holding. Laughing he saw his arms, which were at least 35 inch biceps. Powerful veiny monsters that could never fill anything other then a 10xl shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh genie!&quot; He said, his voice now booming with masculinity, &quot;this is amazing! I&#39;m a monster!&quot; The genie smiled and said &quot;I&#39;m glad you approve football Nate! That is what I shall call you now, until the process is complete.&quot; Nate didn&#39;t realize what genie said, he was to enchanted and enthralled by all the fun and damage he&#39;ll do on the field. Genie had trained his mind and body well. Genie waved his hand and a brown spot began to form on his nose. &quot;What&#39;s this genie?&quot; He asked bewildered as it began to spread, covering his nose and reaching his face. &quot;Well master you wished to be a NFL ball, to be used and played with. Though master I didn&#39;t know for how long, so unless you only wish it for a game, I shall make it for a season of play? Unless you wish to turn back or be this way forever?&quot; Genie stood and waited for a moment as Nate stood there shocked. &quot;Oh genie I never thought of this until now!&quot; The tannned brown now was covering his head and hair and now spread to his shoulders. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what I want? I suppose it&#39;ll be alright for a season? Will it hurt?&quot; Genie shook his head and laughed faintly &quot;no master, a football has no feelings or thoughts, it cannot feel, see, hear, or anything humans can. It just exists for a game.&quot; As he said this the brown was now at his chest and back, his body a nice tan leather brown. &quot;Oh genie! I guess I won&#39;t know then?&quot; The genie shook his head up and down, watching nates arms and legs become brown, as well as his legs and feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry football Nate, this will be fun! The whole time you&#39;ll feel, well you&#39;ll see! But first you must listen to trainer and stand on the tee like a good ball!&quot; He pushed Nate who waddled back to the tee in the middle of the field. He went sideways through the double doors, his body just able to squeeze tightly through. He waddled to a giant tee on which his hulking body hefted itself on, the genie pushing his massive body to its limit, and Nate blindly following like a good ball. Wait? Ball? He&#39;s not a ball yet? Genie looked at him and waived his hand, and the process began.<br />
<br />
First Nates tattered uniform disappeared, leaving him naked and rich brown leather in texture. He then realized his skin was now the texture of a football. &quot;Genie this is weird? I&#39;m not a ball, am I?&quot; He asked confused and bewildered in thought. &quot;Don&#39;t worry football, your mind is just disappearing, taking on a new purpose as it forms into air, matching the rest of you. Nate began to feel strange as a hissing noise filled the field with sound, echoing off the rafters and bleachers around him. His body felt as though it was lighter somehow, like he was a kid at a carnival with an all day pass. He giggled with happiness as genie said &quot;now grow football, take your shape into your new life.&quot; In almost a zombie state nates body swelled, his stomach protruding out more. <br />
<br />
It started in his stomach, then his thighs, and beneath his chest, all swelling up with air. His insides beginning to change into his new rubber bladder that was once his stomach. He giggled stupidly as parts of his brain disappeared more and more. &quot;I like footballs, I a good football.&quot; He said as his body still felt giddy and light. Genie watched as his leather hair succeeded into his head, which had now began to form into a point at the top. His feet now melded as one, forming the other point to a football, and the tee fit him perfectly now. He rested there, no longer with a beastly body, but the shape and look of a leather football, with a facial feature that was becoming less. Soon his shoulder and neck disappeared, swelling into one pointed form that reached his now triangular head. Nate now just drolled and smiled as his ears melded into his head. <br />
<br />
Genie walked over to the Nate football and said, &quot;don&#39;t worry master, no one will ever destroy you, I&#39;ll protect you until you&#39;ve changed back.&quot; After the last word Nate tried to speak, but all that came out was a hiss of air as his mouth melded into his face, becoming just a rounded leather surface. Soon his eyes and nose took suit, and there before genie was a giant football. Genie took his finger and began to write on the side of it, tanning the right words into his side. &quot;Let&#39;s see inflate to 9 pounds, we need the football companies logo, hmmm? official ball of the NFL! There! All done!&quot; He snapped his fingers in satisfaction as the ball and tee shrank down to regular size, making a sound like a balloon loosing air. Genie became invisible as the team began to come onto the field to start practice. Someone picked up the ball and said &quot;hey! Let&#39;s use this ball for the season instead of switching out all the time!&quot; The coach picked it up and placed it on top of a rack, marking in pen &quot;for games only&quot;, and left the room. Genie appeared again and said &quot;don&#39;t worry master, you&#39;ll be used!&quot; And became invisible, waiting for someone to take the ball again.</p>
