<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Since s1 is out of town for a few days, I&#39;m going to add an extra chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abby and Samson were sure happy to be home after their unexpectedly long vacation in India. The City of Kings wasn&#39;t a bad place to visit, but there are certain amenities that the rural Indian colony lacked. Thankfully, they had a stable cell phone reception and good wi-fi or else they have gone nuts there. But Abby had been waiting to try out certain things when they got back.<br />
<br />
The Brown farm&#39;s new sauna had been mostly finished before they left. When the Brown family returned, they were surprised but not displeased to see an outside shower has been built in connection to the sauna. After all, it got hot and dirty walking on the farm, so a quick cold shower would be welcome. And it would also be a good thing to have after getting out of the sauna and washing off the sweat and other bodily fluids.<br />
<br />
It was already a given that the sauna and outdoor shower were going to be yet another place for Animalian couples to sneak off to for a little mating. Abby and Samson have already had several little trysts in various corners of the farm. Abby was sure her parents have done the same after their conversions. And Abby had been looking forward to fucking Samson in the sauna for weeks now.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Samson sighed as he leaned back, rivulets of sweat running through his short black fur, flowing down the natural crevices his muscles formed. He breathed in the herbal-scented steam before blowing it out. &quot;This feels nice, but isn&#39;t hot enough outside without steaming ourselves?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saunas are supposed to have some health benefits,&quot; said Abby, &quot;They can help detoxify the body, clear the sinuses, and help with respiration problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that true?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I do feel more relaxed,&quot; said Abby as she untied the towel she was wearing. She let it fall open, revealing her naked body underneath.<br />
<br />
Samson&#39;s body was quick to respond. The towel he was wearing around his waist tented before the knot was forced open. His equine cock soon rose to full height. &quot;I thought were going to enjoy the sauna more before that,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;ll be time for that later,&quot; said Abby as she sauntered over to her stallion. She started stroking his shaft and gave his balls a little fondling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;ve been really looking forward to this,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;After waiting for the monsoon to give us an opening to go home, you better believe I have,&quot; said Abby. She knelt down and put Samson&#39;s cock between her breasts before giving the head a lick.<br />
<br />
Samson whickered before he said, &quot;Isn&#39;t it a little dangerous to spend too long in a sauna?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby took her lips off her mate&#39;s cock and said, &quot;We don&#39;t have the sauna up hot enough to risk overheating. If we do get too hot, we can go out and use the shower to cool down. Now be quiet and let me enjoy this.&quot; As she returned to sucking Samson&#39;s cock, the mention of the cool shower did remind Abby of what she and Samson did back in India...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The rainy season was not just a name. Climate change has sometimes delayed the monsoon or make it not as long, but it still came. The torrential downpour revitalized the land, but it made pretty much all outside work impossible. Unfortunately, that also included air travel. The planes at New Delhi&#39;s airport wouldn&#39;t fly so long as the rain was coming so hard down. Which mean Abby&#39;s family ended up staying at the City of Kings longer than intended.<br />
<br />
Abby sighed as she looked up at the rainy sky through the window. It didn&#39;t look to be letting up any time soon. &quot;That reminds me so much of what you use to do on rainy days when you were a little girl,&quot; said Josephine with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to get fed up with this rain,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did bring some books to read, right? And we still have wi-fi,&quot; said Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you can only sit and read for so long before you get restless,&quot; said Abby bitterly.<br />
<br />
Josephine tilted her head and asked, &quot;What&#39;s really bothering you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s going to be me and Samson&#39;s anniversary tomorrow and we won&#39;t be able to get back in time to do our...yearly ritual,&quot; said Abby. While they were both double-dosed Animalians, she couldn&#39;t really tell her mother that she and Samson go out to the stump in the woods where she first converted and recreate their first mating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, sometimes things happen that get in the way of annual things,&quot; said Josephine, &quot;You just need to work around them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but me and Samson would like a bit more privacy,&quot; said Abby. As a general rule of courtesy, both couples tried to avoid having sex while the other couple was within earshot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, them&#39;s the breaks,&quot; said Josephine simply, &quot;Not much point in going outside. Your clothes will get soaked and clinging in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby twitched her ear as an idea came to her. &quot;Maybe me and Samson can work something out,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The next day was more rain, but Abby and Samson weren&#39;t staying inside. They had brought their swimsuits for some swimming and were currently wearing them as they headed out. &quot;Doesn&#39;t make much sense going swimming when it&#39;s raining,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Abby lightly, &quot;We&#39;re going to be getting wet anyways.It would be less sense to bring towels since they&#39;ll get wet too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby, this isn&#39;t the way to the river,&quot; said Samson. One of the reasons the Village of Grass Fields was built where it was had to do with the river that was nearby. Everybody depended on fresh water to survive. Before some of the major renovations happened, the river was a common place to bathe and swim to cool down, so long as it was done downstream of where water for drinking was drawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a private place,&quot; said Abby. A little part of her felt bad for misleading Samson, but she wasn&#39;t really lying. She was just being vague with her words. Anyways, they weren&#39;t going too far from the village. The Tiger Guards marked the edges of the village&#39;s territory and they were still well within those limits.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Abby found what she was looking for; a small clearing made where a tree fell, its trunk still lying on the forest floor. &quot;Here we are,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn&#39;t look like a place to swim,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said we were swimming,&quot; said Abby, &quot;I said, &#39;Put your swimsuit on, Samson, I want to show you something&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know what today is, right?&quot; asked Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not our anniversary yet, is it?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re here because...&quot; started Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can do our yearly ritual,&quot; said Abby before unfastening her bikini top and letting her breasts out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d want to do it in the jungle in the rain,&quot; said Samson, eying his mare&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the closest we&#39;ll be able to get and the rain will wash us clean when we&#39;re done,&quot; said Abby as she pulled down her bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you know someone won&#39;t stumble across us?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because only stupid Americans would think about going out in the rain to fuck,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
Samson chuckled and said, &quot;Sometimes I forget how daring you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I be?&quot; asked Abby, &quot;I was the first human turned into an Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m the lucky stud who&#39;s your mate,&quot; said Samson as he pulled down his swimshorts.<br />
<br />
Abby licked her lips at the sight of his rod, already glistening from the rain. &quot;You&#39;re a stud, alright. Now sit on that tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rain continued to fall as Abby and Samson acted out their first mating. Samson sat on the stump, or fallen tree in this case. Abby sucked him off while giving him a boob job until he was fully ready. Then she straddled her horse before lowering herself onto his cock. The rain was still falling as Abby rode her stallion...<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Abby was so lost in her memory she nearly forgotten what she was doing right now. Which was pretty much the same thing in India except she and Samson were indoors and it was steamy instead of raining. Samson was succking on her nipples to bring her closer to her climax. She felt herself tightening around his shaft. Soon, the two horses let out whinnies as Samson erupted inside her.<br />
<br />
Abby was sweating quite a bit now as she leaned against her stallion. &quot;This is never going to get old,&quot; she said dreamily.<br />
<br />
Samson&#39;s mind was on something else. &quot;Abigail, we&#39;ve been doing this for 6 years now,&quot; he said, &quot;When are we going to have our own foal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what my parents said,&quot; said Abby, &quot;Not until we&#39;re married and we can&#39;t get married until we&#39;re finished with college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After all we&#39;ve done, we might as well be married,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I promise you it&#39;ll be worth it,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do want foals, don&#39;t you?&quot; asked Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than you can imagine,&quot; said Abby. Maybe it was the way her hormones were activated in advance after conversion, maybe it was because of the jealous mares who wanted to claim Samson. But Abby had been thinking about being the mother of Samson&#39;s foals almost since the start of Animalia. Of course, high school pregnancies let to a lot of social problems, let alone having kids out of wedlock. If Abby&#39;s parents hadn&#39;t be persistent about her finishing college, she&#39;d have married Samson as soon as she graduated high school. But there was still time. Besides, they&#39;d have to figure out where they&#39;d be raising their family. Abby and Samson couldn&#39;t just keep living with her parents, especially if they have their own foal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby, I&#39;m feeling a little woozy,&quot; said Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, considering what we did to get your blood pressure up, no wonder,&quot; said Abby before pulling herself off of Samson, &quot;I think it&#39;s time for a nice cold shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, body temperature&#39;s high enough already,&quot; said Samson as he stood up a little shakily.<br />
<br />
Abby helped Samson step out of the sauna and towards the showers. Perhaps summertime was a bit too hot for sauna sex, especially during heat waves. Spring and autumn might be better. And the feisty mare side of her was already wondering when she and Samson could have some outdoor shower sex.</p>
