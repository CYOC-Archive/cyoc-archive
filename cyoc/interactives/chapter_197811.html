<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelly woke up early, filled with an indescribable need.  She reached down between her legs, the ring strangely cool against her flesh, and she teased herself, thinking about Jamie.  Kissing Jamie.  Fucking Jamie.<br />
<br />
All she wanted to do was pleasure her mistress.  And if she was good, be rewarded.  Release felt good, but then she had to clean up.  <br />
<br />
In the shower, she kept staring at the ring.  It was cursed.  Evil.  It had taken away her free will and made her into a slave to someone she despised.  But..<br />
<br />
It had also brought salvation.  She could think clearly now.  And her hatred and bitter jealousy had turned into love.  The ring brought with it a promise.  Kelly had put it on the fourth finger of her left hand without thinking about it.<br />
<br />
But symbolically, it was the only wedding ring she would ever wear.  And that made her happy.<br />
<br />
Getting dressed, she was keenly aware that her clothing was a bit loose.  Her bra definitely didn&#39;t fit right.  Jamie had...shrunk her!<br />
<br />
She shivered at the power the other girl had over her.  And she knew that she desperately wanted to shrink even more than this, until Jamie towered over her.  How small could she become?  Could she be turned into a tiny doll for her mistress to play with?<br />
<br />
She sat on her bed, a fantasy of being shrunken to such a small size that she could crawl over Jamie&#39;s naked body, exploring a forbidden landscape...she couldn&#39;t take it!<br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t pleasure herself again, she had to get ready.  She found an older outfit that fit better, and covered her nipples with two small band-aids, deciding to not wear a bra today.  She felt naughty.<br />
<br />
Naughty for her mistress.  There was only one way she could be naughtier, she realized.<br />
<br />
As she walked to the kitchen to make breakfast, the cool air against her pussy was a torment.  But she endured, for her love.  She hoped Jamie would be pleased when she found out her slave wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear under her skirt.<br />
<br />
She had to be careful that her skirt didn&#39;t ride up her ass, of course, and it felt uncomfortable as hell, but that only made her more aroused.  At some point, she could see herself grabbing Jamie and pulling her into an unused classroom...<br />
<br />
She bit her lip.  Would the ring let her do that?  She hoped so.  Even though she had yet to earn a reward, she wanted nothing more than to tease Jamie&#39;s nipples, nibble on her soft skin, and lick out her pussy until her mouth was rewarded with the other girl&#39;s sweet juices...<br />
<br />
&#39;Fuck!  I&#39;m totally a slut for her!&#39;, she realized.  And she liked it.  She wanted to get a tattoo that said &#39;Jamie&#39;s Slut&#39;.  And she wanted to walk into school totally naked so everyone could see it.<br />
<br />
She knew that Jamie was worried about how her friends would treat her.  But none of them felt like they mattered anymore.  Thanks to her mistress, she was strong.  She could fight.  She could put anyone in their place.<br />
<br />
Including her soon to be ex-boyfriend, Jared.  All he&#39;d ever wanted was to touch her body, staring at her lewdly until she felt completely naked under his gaze.  But he was tall, strong, handsome and popular.<br />
<br />
Her body had always betrayed her- despite her independent, strong-willed nature, she had an uncontrollable desire to be dominated.  Eventually he would have tried to force himself upon her, and she wouldn&#39;t have fought him...<br />
<br />
It was enough to make her puke.  But things were different now.  She belonged to Jamie.  Her body was no longer her own.  It was with that in mind that she ate a light breakfast.  She now had a better reason than ever to watch her weight.<br />
<br />
She needed to be beautiful for her mistress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normally she waited around for her friends.  Gina&#39;s older brother, Cole, usually drove the lot of them to school in his car.  Today, however, she walked to the bus stop.  The other kids there simply stared at her.<br />
<br />
Confused?  Surprised?<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t care.  She had gone to extra effort today to make herself look as gorgeous as possible.  The boys lusted after her.  The girls were jealous and wanted to -be- her.<br />
<br />
Normally, she didn&#39;t blame them because she knew she was beautiful.  Now, however, that had changed.  She didn&#39;t blame them, because to be her, was to be -Jamie&#39;s-.  It was the greatest feeling.<br />
<br />
<br />
She walked onto the bus like a princess, but rather than go to the back and try to bully her way into a seat, she simply took an empty seat and stared out the window.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me.”  She heard a soft voice.  “May I sit here?”<br />
<br />
She turned and saw a girl she didn&#39;t know.  Maybe a year younger than she was.  Mousy brown hair, brown eyes.  She wore jeans and an oversized sweatshirt that proclaimed her to be a Hufflepuff.<br />
<br />
Just yesterday, she would have destroyed this girl for merely existing.  Instead she smiled.  “Sure thing.”<br />
<br />
The girl sat down, trying to give Kelly as much space as she could, as if willing herself to shrink.  Kelly regarded the girl.  Guarded.  Afraid.  Self-conscious.  &#39;Probably because of me&#39;, she thought.<br />
<br />
“Hey.  You can sit closer, I won&#39;t bite.”  She smiled as warmly as she could.  “I&#39;m Kelly.”<br />
<br />
“I..I know who you are.”  The girl said, but she did inch a little closer.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I bet.  Kelly the bitch.  Kelly the bully.”  She sighed.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t say that!”  The girl exclaimed, her eyes big.<br />
<br />
“I know you didn&#39;t.  But it&#39;s true.  I haven&#39;t been a good person.  But don&#39;t worry.  I&#39;m better now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh...did you get therapy?”  The girl asked.<br />
<br />
“Something like that.  So what&#39;s your...”<br />
<br />
She was cut off by a boy who leaned over the seat behind them.  “Hey, Kelly, you want me to get rid of this cockroach girl for you?”<br />
<br />
The girl hunched over, afraid.<br />
<br />
Kelly rose, and kneeled on her seat, looking back at the boy behind her.  He was...unremarkable.  He had a friend next to him that was even more unremarkable.  Scum.  Lesser bullies who were bullied themselves, so they tormented others.<br />
<br />
She reached out and grabbed the boy by the neck of his shirt and pulled him close.  With her new strength, it was like grabbing a rag doll.  “I want you to listen very carefully, asshole.  I didn&#39;t give you permission to talk to me.  I would never give you permission to talk to me.  You just need to do two things and I&#39;ll pretend you don&#39;t exist.<br />
<br />
You leave this girl the fuck alone.  And you never talk to me again.”  She pushed him back into his seat, hard.  He simply gaped at her like a fish trying to suck water into it&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
His friend looked terrified.<br />
<br />
Kelly took her seat again and smiled at the girl.  “So what&#39;s your name, honey?”<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time she got off the bus, there were whispers and rumors flying.  But those whispers were fearful.  Kelly walked on the bus like a queen, and she walked off it the same way, but now her new friend, Rachel, was walking in front of her, under her protection.<br />
<br />
“Sit with me at lunch, Rachel.  I want to introduce you to my friend.”<br />
<br />
The girl nodded, still shell-shocked, but Kelly gave her a hug to reassure her.  “And if anyone messes with you, here&#39;s my number.  Just text me.”<br />
<br />
“I...I don&#39;t have a phone.”  Rachel admitted.<br />
<br />
“Really?  We&#39;ll have to fix that.  Well come find me then.  Good luck!”<br />
<br />
<br />
They headed to their separate classes, Kelly completely unaware that Rachel was completely lovestruck by her.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was second period when her cronies confronted her at her locker.  Asking why she was hanging out with Jamie.  Were the rumors true?  Did she actually -kiss- that lesbo freak?  Why did she take the bus?<br />
<br />
Now, to be honest, not all of her “friends” were bad.  Some of them had simply been drug along with Kelly&#39;s cult of personality til this point.  That was on her, and she would have to fix that.  But Shelly, her second-in-command, was an equally mean bitch.  And Kelly knew Shelly hated her.<br />
<br />
Kelly casually grabbed Shelly by the front of her blouse and pulled her in close.  Shelly squawked.<br />
<br />
“Shelly, Shelly, Shelly.  You and I are a lot alike, you know that?  Bitter, mean-spirited bitches to the core.  But there&#39;s one difference.  I realized what I was, and I found I didn&#39;t like that person.  At all.  So from now on, I&#39;m going to be different.<br />
<br />
You all might decide you don&#39;t want to be friends anymore, because I won&#39;t be stuck up and popular.  I&#39;m okay with that.  Honestly, I think most of you are better people without me in your lives.  But you, Shelly?  You&#39;ll just take my place, and encourage the others to be little bitches too.<br />
<br />
And we can&#39;t have that.  So I&#39;m going to say this once, with love, as your friend.  Change.  Stop being mean, stop being a bully.  Find someone you can actually love, and be better.  <br />
<br />
You&#39;ll be happier.  Because if you don&#39;t, you and I are going to have a problem, and you don&#39;t want that.<br />
<br />
Then, with a smile, she pulled Shelly into a kiss, before shoving her back.<br />
<br />
Shelly looked completely stunned.<br />
<br />
“And as for Jamie, yes, I kissed her.  And it felt good.  I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll become my girlfriend.  So what do you have to say about that?”<br />
<br />
“You...you lesbian freak!  You kissed me!”  Shelly looked horrified.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, Shelly, I&#39;ll pretend I didn&#39;t notice how turned on you were.  Just tell your parents, and they&#39;ll ship you off to camp this summer to pray away the gay.  Well, I&#39;m off to class.  Have a good life, girls!”  She blew them all a kiss and walked off.<br />
<br />
Gina was the only one who was able to say anything.  “I don&#39;t think Kelly is wearing any underwear.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, third period, she had a class with Jamie.  She forewent her normal seat in front, and sat in the back next to the other girl.<br />
<br />
Jamie kept staring at her.  She hoped that was awe in the other girl&#39;s eyes!<br />
<br />
Kelly smiled and mouthed &#39;I love you&#39;, making Jamie blush in a way that was positively adorable.<br />
<br />
She was even able to give the girl a quick hug as they left class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jared found her just before lunch.  He looked steamed.<br />
<br />
“Hey!”  He put his hand on a locker, standing too close, trying to intimidate her with his size.  She was keenly aware she was a little smaller now, but she felt no fear.<br />
<br />
Her Jamie was ten times, no, a hundred times more powerful than he was.<br />
<br />
“Not here, dumbass.  Try a farm.”  She regarded him coolly.<br />
<br />
“Wha...hey you dumb bitch, what&#39;s this Shelly told me about you turning into a lesbian?!”<br />
<br />
“What, you thought I was going out with you because I like boys?  Ugh, don&#39;t make me laugh.  You&#39;re sweaty and smell like a goat.”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you talk to me like that!”  He snapped.<br />
<br />
She stamped her foot down on his instep, hooked a leg around the back of his knee, and threw him to the ground.  Then she straddled his waist and grabbed him by the neck with both hands.<br />
<br />
It happened so fast that Jared couldn&#39;t even react, he just gaped at her.<br />
<br />
“First, let me make this official.  I&#39;m breaking up with you.  I&#39;ve found someone who is a hundred times the man you are- and she&#39;s a girl!  Second, you don&#39;t intimidate me, Jared.  You&#39;re just a little boy with too many muscles and a small dick.  You&#39;re a beast, and you and I both know that you are incapable of treating a girl right.  You think we&#39;re all just places to shove you tiny penis into! <br />
<br />
Well, listen up, dumbass.  If I -ever- hear about you disrespecting a girl, I&#39;ll KILL you.”  She slammed his head against the floor to make her point, then punched him in the eye, just enough to give him a giant bruise.<br />
<br />
Then she stood up and stomped on his groin, causing him to double over in agony.  But she wasn&#39;t done.  She undid his pants and pulled them down, along with his stupid boxers (actually, she thought to herself, I need a pair of boxers, they look comfy), revealing his junk.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok&#39;, she admitted.  &#39;He wasn&#39;t -that- small, but he was nowhere near an erection at the moment.  She saw a few camera flashes.  She made sure to let Jared get a look up her skirt before she turned and walked off.  Just so he&#39;d know what he could never have.<br />
<br />
She noticed a teacher, Mrs. Amber, staring at her. <br />
<br />
Well, she figured she would get in trouble over this.  But to her surprise, Mrs. Amber smiled and gave her a wink before she went to shoo away the other students and yell at Jared to stop exposing himself.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well!&#39;, she thought.  &#39;That was unexpected.  But awesome.&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
She sat down across from Jamie, feeling pretty good about herself.  “Hi hon, how was your day?”<br />
<br />
Jamie gaped at her a moment.  “What did you do?  You&#39;re practically glowing, and your hair is mussed up!”  Then in a quieter voice.  “It&#39;s really hot.”<br />
<br />
Kelly grinned and was about to answer, when she heard a soft voice.  “Excuse me, can I still...sit here?”<br />
<br />
“Oh I hope you don&#39;t mind, Jamie.  I made a new friend.  This is Rachel.  Rachel, this is Jamie.”<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded.  “I have a few classes with her.  She&#39;s really smart.  I mean, you&#39;re really smart, Jamie.”<br />
<br />
Jamie blinked, then smiled.  “Thanks, Rachel.  And no, I don&#39;t mind.  But I do want to hear about your day, Kelly.”<br />
<br />
So Kelly told both girls, but quickly, she found she had an audience.  This was the table of the outcasts and the socially awkward, after all.  And from their point of view, an angel had descended from the very heavens.  By the end of lunch period, she was their new hero.<br />
<br />
She managed to whisper to Jamie.  “Am I doing good, mistress?”<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled up at her.  “You&#39;ve earned a reward, yes.  We&#39;ll talk later.”<br />
<br />
“I love you.”  <br />
<br />
Jamie just smiled.  <br />
<br />
That would have to be good enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t that the rest of the day went without incident.  Jared had been sent home early.  Surprisingly, no one had brought Kelly&#39;s behavior to the principal, so she had avoided any reprisals.<br />
<br />
Shelly was trying her best to turn people against her, but found that not as many people were willing to listen as she expected.<br />
<br />
Something was happening, and she didn&#39;t like it one bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
After school, Kelly met up with her friends by the tree.  “So Jamie, I was thinking to buy Rachel a phone.  What do you think?”<br />
<br />
Jamie seemed to consider that.  “That&#39;s really nice of you, Kelly.  Can you afford that after yesterday?”<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have to, Kelly, I&#39;ll be ok.”  Rachel tried to protest.<br />
<br />
“I know I don&#39;t have to, Rachel.  But I want to.”  She smiled.  “And yeah, you know my parents.  No time for me, so they just throw money at me.”  Her smile faltered.  That had never bothered her before, but now...it hurt.<br />
<br />
Jamie gave her a hug, sensing the shift in her mood.  “It&#39;s going to be ok, Kelly.”<br />
<br />
That brought Kelly&#39;s smile right back, and she called them an Uber.<br />
<br />
<br />
Later, at the mall, the three girls sat at a table in the food court, a brand new smart phone in Rachel&#39;s possession.  “Hey Rachel, not that I have anything against Harry Potter, but isn&#39;t that sweatshirt a little warm?”<br />
<br />
Rachel shrank nervously.  “I...it&#39;s fine.”<br />
<br />
Jamie frowned.  “I don&#39;t think it is.  Hey, you don&#39;t have to tell us, but we&#39;re concerned.  If you want to talk, we&#39;ll listen.”<br />
<br />
Kelly nodded.  “Absolutely.”<br />
<br />
“...well, can you answer a question first?”  Rachel blushed, looking uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing.”  Kelly said.<br />
<br />
“Is it true that you and Jamie are girlfriends?”<br />
<br />
Jamie raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
Kelly sighed.  “No.  I wish it was, because I love Jamie very much, but I used to be a terrible person, especially to her.  So I need to prove that I&#39;ve changed.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.”  Rachel said, looking dejected.<br />
<br />
Jamie reached over and put a hand on Rachel&#39;s shoulder.  “Hey.  Are you falling for Kelly?”<br />
<br />
Kelly blinked, surprised.<br />
<br />
“I...well...I mean...she was nice to me...and...she&#39;s so pretty...”  Rachel looked near tears.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Oh wow.”  Kelly looked to Jamie for help.<br />
<br />
Jamie seemed to consider this (one can imagine her asking herself, &#39;what would Gemory do&#39;?).  “I have an idea.  Hey Rachel.  If Kelly keeps doing better, I do want to go out with her.  But I don&#39;t mind sharing her.”<br />
<br />
Rachel&#39;s eyes got big.  “Wh...what?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m proposing we share Kelly.  She can be your girlfriend, and my girlfriend too.”  Jamie smiled.<br />
<br />
“Uh...does that mean we have to...uh...do things...together?”  Rachel looked really uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“Only if you want to.”  Jamie said.<br />
<br />
“...doesn&#39;t...kelly...get a say in this?”  Rachel managed to squeak out.<br />
<br />
Jamie looked to Kelly.  “Well, how about it?  Would you mind being Rachel&#39;s girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
Kelly was confused.  Was this an order?  Is this what Jamie wanted?  But looking at Rachel...sweet, gentle Rachel...  “I wouldn&#39;t mind at all.”<br />
<br />
Rachel did start crying then, and both girls comforted her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Later, in the women&#39;s rest room, Rachel took off her sweatshirt, to reveal burn scars on her back, most of them small and circular.  Crying, she told them about how her father had abused her, and used to punish her by pressing his cigarettes against her.  She lived with a foster family now.  They were good people, but she couldn&#39;t bring herself to let anyone see her body.<br />
<br />
Kelly&#39;s heart melted.  Compared to this, the casual abuse she suffered from her indifferent parents was nothing.  She hugged the girl tightly and kissed her.<br />
<br />
Jamie also joined in the comforting, but there was a rage building inside her.<br />
<br />
<br />
That night, she contacted Gemory again.</p>
