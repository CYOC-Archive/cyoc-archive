<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They all listened to the old man's footsteps crunch into the distance before breaking the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what would you all wish for?&quot; Steve's jovial demeanor showing he wasn't at all affected by the story or <br />
scared by the dark forest. &quot;For me it would be teleportation. I could ski Aspen in the morning, have coffee in <br />
Switzerland, lunch in Paris, then a dinner out in Madrid. Nice!&quot;  Nina was glaring at him just a little, and <br />
he added, &quot;of course I'd have to be able to take a date too.&quot; That brought her into the fold and she laid a <br />
small kiss on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Vampire totally.&quot; Brad's choice was no surprise to any of them. He was always wrapped up in the vampire <br />
stories. Campy movie, teen drama, it didn't matter. If there were vampires in it, Brad was all over it. &quot;That <br />
way I could live forever, and make a following of hot vampirettes.&quot; At that his girlfriend Keri did more than <br />
glare, she punched him clear in the shoulder. &quot;What?!?&quot; Brad didn't seem to understand her response.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I would wish for telepathy. That way I'd know if this pig was cheating on me, and maybe make him stop.&quot; <br />
They all laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;My wish would be shape-shifting.&quot; They were not even paying attention when Nina shared her thought, but all <br />
eyes turned to her. &quot;What? I've never been the prettiest girl. For once, just once I'd like to be.&quot; Brad and <br />
Keri laughed, while Steve tried to whisper to her. &quot;And I'd like to have boobs.&quot; She turned her attention to <br />
Daniel, who had been typically silent most of the night. &quot;What about you Daniel? What would you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad chimed in, never missing a chance to poke fun, &quot;ya nerd, what would you wish for? A life?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, it's just a stupid story.&quot; Daniel knew exactly what he would want. Looking at the two couples <br />
flirt, and feeling like a lost soul as he so often did. He'd want to make women want him. &quot;Fine. I'd wish to <br />
be superman.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So cliche, geek boy, but you do already have the perfect Clark Kent cover.&quot; Keri hit Brad again, this time <br />
for making fun of Daniel. <br />
<br />
Daniel defended himself verbally, &quot;You think stones grant wishes, and you're making fun of me?&quot; Even as he <br />
did, it seemed like nobody was listening. Steve and Nina were already making out. Brad and Keri hardly heard <br />
his answer as they followed suit. Daniel slinked off into his lonely tent and tried ineffectually to sleep <br />
through the sounds of couples rustling in their tents. <br />
<br />
--- <br />
<br />
&quot;Watch out there, that's poison oak,&quot; Daniel shared as he stepped carefully past it. Halfway through the next <br />
day, hiking through the woods, Steve and Nina still hadn't stopped making out. They straggled behind the other <br />
three.<br />
<br />
Brad wished he and Keri were doing the same, while she tried to help Daniel not feel forgotten. &quot;Thanks for <br />
coming along on this trip. It's good to have one person who knows something about the woods along with us.&quot; <br />
She looked carefully at the plant as she stepped by it, and somewhere in the brush behind it a flickering <br />
light caught her eye. She stopped and looked again, moving carefully towards the shiny black, green, and <br />
purple flicker. &quot;Guy, oh my god, get over here.&quot; <br />
<br />
The old man's story was fresh in her mind as she approached the rock. Could it really be? &quot;Steve, Nina, save <br />
it for the tent and come look at this.&quot; Brad hadn't moved from the path, his shoulders shrugged in impatience. <br />
As if he had somewhere to be. Daniel followed her off the path, more for fear she would dive into some more <br />
poison oak than anything else. When he too saw the rock, he had to admit it bore a striking resemblance to the <br />
old man's story. <br />
<br />
&quot;That looks like Black Quartz. It's a quite common.&quot; He pulled the fleece from around his waist, using it to <br />
wipe the rock clean. The part poking out of the dirt was a couple feet square, and more of it appeared to be <br />
buried beneath. Cleaned off, it shimmered with a moving translucent glow that seemed almost alive. Certainly <br />
unlike any Quartz he'd ever seen. <br />
<br />
Steve, Nina, and Brad finally made their way off the path. Nina spoke up first. &quot;Is that what I think it is?&quot; <br />
All of them thought of the same answer, but nobody voiced it. Then, just seconds later, Brad slumped to his <br />
knees and began to scream in agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh! Fucking hell, it burns.&quot; He was looking at his hands, each of which were smoldering in the light <br />
peaking through the tree cover. &quot;Ahh, do something?! Help me.&quot; A moment later he was lying on the ground, as <br />
small flames erupted from under his collar and wrist cuffs. They all stood silently, partly in amazement, <br />
partly in shock, as Brad proceeded to spontaneously catch flame and burn right there on the ground. Less than <br />
a minute after it started his flesh was ghost white, and a few seconds later, his entire body seemed to <br />
deflate into dust and he was gone.<br />
<br />
Steve spoke up first. &quot;What the fuck just happened?&quot; He was moving now, visibly agitated as he stomped his <br />
foot down on the white ash that used to be his friend Brad. &quot;What the -fuck- just happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you see.&quot; Nina hurried to him. &quot;It's the stone. He wished to be a vampire, and the sun,&quot; she briefly <br />
looked up to the sky, &quot;the sun kills vampires.&quot; They each looked at each other in disbelief. <br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way. No fucking way. If that happened this guy would be superman,&quot; he said, accusingly pointing at <br />
Daniel. He gently punched him, easily knocking him to the ground. &quot;And I'd be able to teleport.&quot; With that he <br />
disappeared, appearing across and behind where Keri now lay weeping over the pile of ashed she realized was <br />
her now dead boyfriend. His shouted a bit from his new location, &quot;No fucking way! I can teleport!&quot; With that, <br />
he began blinking around them playfully, shouting each time. &quot;here I am. Nope, here I am.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nina was instantly concerned. &quot;Steve, stop. Be careful. Steve, stop!&quot;</p>
