<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty just grinned as he saw his classmate from school, Samuel Martin, as he just lay there in one of the lounge chairs by the side of the pool. The large public pool was located right in front of the new gymnastics center, so most of the boys and girls who came to swim there were relatively athletic. Obviously, Samuel didn’t seem to fit in so well. The boy was new in town, he was skinny as a rail, he was pale as a ghost, he was short in stature and he didn’t have an ounce of muscle on him. The odds were stacked against him for him to ever becoming very popular in high school, unless Ty intervened.<br />
<br />
First, Ty decided to use his amazing powers to simply read his mind. Ty wished for him to have that ability, so he decided to use it. By just staring at Samuel from a distance, Ty was able to hear the boy’s thoughts. He was shy, lonely and insecure, especially since he was the new guy in school. He had already been picked on by a few bullies the Friday before, and he was dreading going back to class. He was smart and he was rather geeky, so that didn’t help him either. He liked playing soccer, but he was too scared to sign up for the team.<br />
<br />
“I know enough about you, Sam…” Ty whispered to himself. “It’s time to give you a tan, to make you look a little more attractive. Then we’ll make taller, to make you stand out. Then we’ll add a few pounds worth of muscle to your frame! And while we’re at it… How about we add gymnastics to your list of sports?” Ty chuckled. Ty then wished for all those things to happen to Samuel, in that order.<br />
<br />
While Samuel was sitting in his chair, with his eyes closed, he was suddenly overcome by a tingling sensation. His dry, pale skin began to change color, as the pale white complexion started to darken very slowly. His complexion slowly began to change as it began to transform into a golden light brown, giving him a nice tanned look. His light hair became more like a long wavy dirty blond, like that of a California surfer boy. In fact, the sudden golden light brown tan along with the dirty blond hair made Samuel look like he was a poster child from the beach.<br />
<br />
Next, his legs began to stretch. At first, Samuel didn’t realize what was going on. But he n=began to hear a soft cracking sound, coming from deep inside of him. It also seemed as if his skeletal structure was changing! His bones were becoming longer! His limbs were lengthening out of nowhere!<br />
<br />
As Samuel looked down at his feet, he realized that he was still wearing his sandals. Then it dawned on him that his ankles, his feet, and his toes appeared to be growing longer and wider!<br />
<br />
“What… What’s going on?” he wondered, as he swung his feet around and got up from the chair. His feet were slowly becoming too big for the sandals, and they fit very tight! They began to hurt! Samuel almost kicked them off of his feet, when both straps around his feet tore off! His feet practically burst out of his sandals because they had become too big for them!<br />
<br />
Next, his legs grew longer, adding inches to his height. He was barely over 5 feet tall, which was short for a 14 year-old boy. He was rapidly inching up, thanks to Ty’s growth spurt. His arms were becoming longer and his torso was stretching out as well. Within moments, the boy was standing about 5 ft 8 inches tall.<br />
<br />
“Man! This is crazy!” Samuel gasped, as the weird growth spurt was having full effect on him as Ty looked on from the other side of the pool. He silently wished for nobody else to notice anything, so Samuel just gawked at himself in amazement while nobody cared.<br />
<br />
“Time to muscle up, Sam!” Ty laughed quietly, while enjoying the show. “The gymnastics team can use another boy like you!”<br />
<br />
Right then and there, Samuel was overcome with an amazing surge of strength in his muscles. He made fists and tensed every muscle in his body, as he craned his neck and looked up with his eyes closed, moaning softly while Ty allowed the boy’s physical strength to increase. Samuel’s calves inflated from thin muscles to big, bulging, rock-hard slabs of muscle sticking out from the back of his legs, which just popped out like inflated balloons. They grew until they were the size of melons, covered with thick veins all over, just like those that professional bikers had. <br />
<br />
Next, Samuel’s quads grew wider, longer and thicker all at once, as Ty packed on layer upon layer of muscle on the boy’s legs just above the knees. Outrageous muscle just formed on his legs, turning them into tree trunks of steel, covered with thick ropes that were his veins. Truly, the boy began to resemble a junior bodybuilder already.<br />
<br />
“Oohhh man… What is happening to me?” Samuel moaned softly, still not understanding what Ty was doing to him.<br />
<br />
Then, Ty sculpted Samuel’s flat torso into a set of abdominals which looked like a washboard rack, and above that, his chest muscles bulged out thanks to two growing, massive pectorals. His arms grew into thick pythons of strength and power as his biceps and triceps inflated into bowling balls of strength. His lats, delts and traps inflated as well, giving him those huge, thick, broad shoulders that could lift just about anything. For a gymnast, it was an indication that the boy could easily climb, hang and fly from rings and parallel bars. <br />
<br />
Finally, Ty looked down at the navy-colored Speedo that Samuel was wearing. A nice bulge appeared to form around the center of the Speedo, indicating that the boy was quite well endowed. Ty made sure of it and that everybody could see it!<br />
<br />
Ty stood up and walked over to Samuel, who now looked like an amazing athlete. Moments before, he was a skinny, short, pale boy, and now he was a tall, hulking gymnast.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Are you Samuel?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
Samuel turned to face Ty, and looked down on him with a grin on his face, since he was obviously a few inches taller than Ty, who was 5 ft 6.<br />
<br />
“Oh… Umm… Hi… Yeah, I’m Samuel… But just call me Sam…” the boy replied.<br />
<br />
“Hi Sam, I’m Tyler, but you can call me Ty… We’re in the same history class together… So how do you like school so far?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay… A few guys gave me a hard time on Friday… but it’s alright…”<br />
<br />
“They won’t bother you anymore!” Ty grinned. “Don’t worry about them!”<br />
<br />
“I hope so!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s go for a swim!” Ty suggested.<br />
<br />
“Sure! I have gymnastics practice here later on, and I play soccer as well!” Sam added.<br />
<br />
“Really? That’s so cool!”<br />
<br />
Ty and Sam then dove in the pool and took about thirty minutes to swim and have fun before they walked around the gym. Afterwards, Ty watched Sam’s gymnastics training. <br />
<br />
Ty was happy he had changed the pale, short boy, and made him stronger and taller. It was a great way to make a new friend in high school!</p>
