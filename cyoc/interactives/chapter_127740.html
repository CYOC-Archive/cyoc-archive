<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer gazed at her creations one more time. Merging these objects to create new ones were very cool, and with the use of concepts she could give them some exciting twists. Eventually though, merging objects with each other had grown boring, as they were still as lifeless as ever. She gathered her original body parts again and removed everything off her body that wasn&#39;t part of her originally. Now she wanted to research what she could change from her own body in detail.<br />
<br />
Jen looked at what she could change on her face. Her eyes fell on her nose specifically, and she detached it. She examined it. What were its uses? It sits in the middle of her face, and she is able to smell things with it. The nose is also useful for breathing, but she can do that via her mouth as well. There are some other functions the nose has, but from all of them, these two were most important and useful.<br />
<br />
With that, Jen concluded that her nose had a few concepts as well. There was of course a visible concept, that being the concept of skin. But a nose would also have the concept of breathing and the concept of smell. She took the last one out of her nose, leaving this organ almost completely useless. She could still breathe from it, but its most important function was gone. She held concept of &#39;smell&#39; in front of her, and then stuck her tongue out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
From what Jen could remembered, snakes could smell things using their tongues. Just like Jennifer&#39;s now, the nostrils, or in her case both the nose and the nostrils, were only used for breathing through them. Besides that, snakes have a completely different organ to breathe through, while consuming prey.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had stuck her tongue out, but hadn&#39;t detached it, considering it not necessary. She brought the concept of &#39;smell&#39; to her tongue, and watched as it disappeared, or merged with it. She closed her mouth, and walked to a vase with flowers. She tried smelling them with her nose, but found herself unable to. Next, she stuck out her tongue, trying to pick of the scent of the flowers. Once again, her brain did not receive any prickles. She couldn&#39;t smell anymore. Jen looked up information about the snake&#39;s tongue and why her tests didn&#39;t work. After doing some research she could conclude her experiment had failed. She couldn&#39;t smell with her tongue because she didn&#39;t possess of a so called Jacobson&#39;s organ in the roof of her mouth, like snakes do. That experiment failed.<br />
<br />
Then what else was there to be done? Jen took the concept of &#39;smell&#39; out of her tongue and brought it back to her nose. What was her mouth able to do? The mouth was practically the entrance to her stomach. Using her mouth, she could eat food using her mouth. The concept of &#39;taste&#39; on her tongue makes it able to taste food, to indicate whether it is bitter, sweet, salty or sour. Or savory, with that. The mouth is, just like her nose, an entrance to her respiratory system. She is able to breathe through her mouth. So her mouth also had the concept of &#39;breathing&#39;. Next up was how she was able to eat. The muscles in her face, around her mouth and jaws, are able to break food into tiny pieces, enzymes of the saliva helping that with that. Lastly, the food needs to be swallowed. So there were concepts of &#39;chewing&#39;, &#39;saliva&#39; and &#39;swallowing&#39;. Using the air from her longues and her vocal cords, she can also talk. That was pretty much the last of the most important functions. With that came the concept of &#39;speech&#39;. She wouldn&#39;t have that without vocal chords. She also discovered the concept of &#39;eating&#39;, apparently a unique thing, instead of the chewing and swallowing mixed together.<br />
<br />
Jennifer started to think about what she could exchange her mouth with, or at least its concepts. She looked down, and grimaced mischievously. There were three things she could fit a sausage in. The first was her mouth, in which it usually entered, the second was her asshole, from which it exited the body. The third one was her pussy. That body part had both functions, but in a more... figurative sense.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Jennifer entered her room and lied down on her bed. She unbuckled her belt and then slid down her pants and panties. Plucking on one side, she managed to detach her pussy from her body. She also detached her mouth. Comparing the two organs, she saw similarities. Both had lips, had a hole in the middle and were wet on the inside (at least at that moment). The vagina, with that the uterus is not included, has a very few, very simple functions. From what Jen could think of, it had three. It was able to stretch out, for giving birth, it was able to contract, for during orgasms and intercourse, and it was able to pleasure the &#39;wearer&#39;. Her pussy had the concepts of &#39;stretching&#39;, &#39;contraction&#39; and the beloved concept of &#39;pleasure&#39;. Jen realized that her pussy was permanently shut, until called into action. That brought her to the idea that her mouth still had the concept of &#39;opening and closing&#39;, so to say.<br />
<br />
Jennifer removed all the concepts she&#39;d thought of from the two body parts, and then reattached them. She immediately noticed the changes. For a first, she wasn&#39;t able to open her mouth whatsoever. Since her tongue was still fully functional, she could slide that out, but that was pretty much the only way for having it open for a while. Her mouth now only seemed to function as a cage for her tongue. For breathing she could use her nose, the eating and drinking part would prove to be more difficult however. While lying on the bed half-naked, Jen looked at the pussy in between her legs. She saw how it seemed to be... slightly open, with juices drooling out of it. The last part made her realize her pussy still was able to produce juices. The first part, she tried to contract it, hoping to close her pussy but failing to do so, made her realize the organ&#39;s muscles didn&#39;t work anymore. Sticking a finger into her cunt brought no pleasure. The only thing that had changed was her finger having become wet after pulling it out. The clit about her pussy did still function, so she could still easily masturbate and orgasm. During such orgasms, contractions would be impossible.<br />
<br />
Next up came experimenting with mixing the concepts between Jen&#39;s mouth and pussy. The concepts were still &#39;lying&#39; on her bed, mostly hovering above it (although sometimes the were lifted up after making contact with the blanked, only to ignore the laws of gravity again afterwards). She took one, seeing it was the concept of &#39;eating&#39;. Jen restored her pussy again, merging it with its concepts again, but now also added the concept of &#39;eating&#39; with it. Having attached that concept to her pussy, she found that the concepts of &#39;chewing&#39;, &#39;swallowing&#39; and &#39;saliva&#39; from her mouth had disappeared. Had they merged with her pussy as well? Or did they just fade into nothingness? Jennifer was very eager to test it.<br />
<br />
Jennifer attached her mouth again. She had restored that body part as well, albeit only with the leftover concepts, the ones of &#39;speech&#39; and &#39;breathing&#39;. Just to be a bit quicker, she&#39;d put on some jogging pants. Her pussy was still in her hands. She moved over to the kitchen cabinet, hoping to find food of the right shapes and sizes. Her attention was brought to ready-made hot dog buns, with the hot dogs tucked in it already. She grabbed bunch of them, not thinking about warming them up, but probably also not needing to. She quickly grabbed a bottle of water as well, getting a bit thirsty, and hurried op to her room, a good place for further privacy.<br />
<br />
Once in her room, Jen stripped the lower half of her body, and opened the package of one of the hot dogs. The sausage could fit, that was certain, the bun itself would prove to be difficult, so she removed it. Next up was attaching her pussy onto her body again, and becoming acquainted with the new sensations. As soon as it attached, the gentle arousal from her pussy caused her libido to shoot up again. Not waiting a moment longer, she brought the sausage to her groin, and slid it in.<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped, stifling a moan. She saw how she pushed the hot dog inside her deeper and deeper, feeling more and more contractions because of it. The contractions didn&#39;t seem to meant for orgasm this time however. The contractions were stronger, as if, be it instinctively, trying to break down the sausage, &#39;squishing&#39; it in pieces. The contractions didn&#39;t stop, and wouldn&#39;t for a long time. She felt some of the food-pieces enter another, ever so sensitive tube, and her stomach was slowly filling up. With such small amounts of food at a time however, her hunger, both in pleasure and food, wouldn&#39;t fade too quickly. The contractions drove Jennifer into a state of bliss, the whole piece of sausage was now inside her. The pleasure wouldn&#39;t stop, and she felt how an orgasm was approaching.<br />
<br />
The &#39;chewing&#39; from her &#39;mouth&#39; got quicker, and eventually Jennifer orgasmed, violently. All muscles in her body spasmed, and her pussy squirted out its juices, and the remainders of the hot dog she&#39;d just eaten. But here came the fun part: She was still hungry.</p>
