<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yeee-haw!” Gloria called out. Jenny began to cry out, only to freeze. Her throat briefly looked like it was vibrating.<br />
<br />
“Heeee haw!” Jenny brayed. Her hands leapt up to her mouth. Gloria turned to look at her wide-eyed friend.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” Gloria asked. Jenny just shook her head. They entered to a pure dark tunnel. In the dark neither Jenny nor Gloria could see each other. The cold air whipping through the tunnel about froze them. And it made it harder for them to feel what was happening to the mat that moment. Gloria’s ears felt funny. Her entire body was cold from the mist and the wind, but her ears felt like they were burning up. Gloria was now convinced they were on fire. <br />
<br />
If Jenny or Gloria could have seen their ears, they would have seen them reshaping. The tops of their ears were being pulled up, pinched on top by invisible fingers. They stretched like dough, growing thinner as they extended. The tops meanwhile were pulled into points. Their extended veins created pink spider-webs across their pale white skin. All of this went unnoticed by the two as they emerged from a tunnel, only into a wall of mist.<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel so good.” Jenny yelled out. She looked over at her friend, only seeing some of her outline through the mist. <br />
<br />
“You-something’s not right.” Gloria opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. Her hands grabbed at her stomach, which was bubbling and raging. <br />
<br />
Jenny kept talking but Gloria didn’t respond. Her stomach began to burn now. Gloria threw her head back.<br />
<br />
“Heee haw! Heehaw! Hee haw! Hee haw!” Gloria gasped and fell to the floor. Jenny pointed a trembling finger at Gloria. “Your ears!” Jenny cried. Gloria looked up at her.<br />
<br />
“Hee haw!” Gloria brayed again. Before Jenny could scream they jerked around a tight curve. <br />
<br />
Then, the girls felt something brand new, something neither of them had felt before.<br />
<br />
“Oh God!” Jenny groaned. Gloria let out a soft bray. Behind them two bulges began to press out against their panties. At first you could barely see them, just two tiny bumps. But if the girls had seen them they’d have seen the bulges expand before their very eyes. Tents pushed up from just above their butts, held in place only by their very tight waist bands. <br />
<br />
“What’s happening....” Jenny moaned now, her tongue lulling out the side of her mouth. Her new growth was driving her insane. It just kept pushing out. She could feel her underwear ripping, but the denim of her jeans kept it closed. Jenny could see something similar happening to Gloria.<br />
<br />
“Hee haw!” Gloria brayed out, now as her denim began to expand further. <br />
<br />
Jenny’s tail felt like a trapped animal, wrestling against the confines of her pants. She tried to scream out in terror, screaming for anyone who would listen. Gloria meanwhile was drooling and braying. She could feel it, hard as a rock, trying to break through the back of her pants. <br />
<br />
While Jenny was trying to escape and crying in fear, Gloria was awash in pure pleasure.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna be a dumb animal and never have to worry again. Heee haw!”, Gloria brayed. <br />
<br />
The two girls’ pants ripped, and their tails sprouted into the air. Tighter and tighter their pants grew. <br />
<br />
Gloria let out a cry of joy. “I’m a donkey!” Their pants split. Two brand new donkey tails streamed out behind the girls. Jenny pushed her head up to look back at hers. It was rigid and hairy, longer than any other body part Jenny had. It was coated in light brown hair, except for the thick brush of deep brown at the end. Her tail was very hairy, with brown hairs sticking up all across it.<br />
<br />
Jenny’s tail smacked into Gloria’s sending a shiver up both girl’s spines. <br />
<br />
“I have a fucking tail.” Jenny cried out. <br />
<br />
Gloria brayed at her. “I have… I have a tail!” <br />
<br />
Jenny continued to examine her tail. Jenny shook her head, trying to get her voice back. “We’re turning into donkeys!!!!” <br />
<br />
Gloria grinned. “You can’t be enjoying this.”<br />
<br />
Jenny screamed at her friend.<br />
<br />
Gloria turned towards her. “Hee haw!” Gloria brayed, ears folding back. <br />
<br />
“Hee-haw hee-haw hee-haw!” Jenny growled at her. “Stop it!” Jenny yelled. Her temper began to rise. Gloria ignored her. She continued to bray and now began to slap her tail against her butt cheeks.<br />
<br />
Jenny’s own tail began to curl up. “Stop braying!” Jenny yelled. <br />
<br />
Gloria now got in Jenny’s face, still braying. Jenny snorted. “Hee-haw!” Jenny brayed back, screaming at her. “Hee-haw! hee-haw! hee-haw!” <br />
<br />
The two now brayed like the animals they were, and brought on the latest change in both of them. The girl’s teeth began to expand, or rather most of their teeth. Their canines were slowly crushed into nothing by there growing mollars. Their teeth were reshaped into big blocks, designed soley to grind and crush. While their teeth grew, neither of their mouths had grown yet. Their teeth now stuck outside of their mouths. It wasn’t certain either girl could fully close their mouths now. But that was far from their minds.<br />
<br />
 “No no no!” Jenny cried out, her human voice returned. Gloria also was crying out, but in this case with joy. <br />
<br />
Then, the girls enter to another tunnel. This tunnel, unlike the other one, had stripes of light coming through the ceiling. Jenny could see Gloria’s face for brief snippets in the darkness. Now she could see their changed teeth and their big tails flapping in the wind. <br />
<br />
Jenny pointed at her, but Gloria didn’t look up.<br />
<br />
The light seemed to come in shorter flashes but Jenny was finally able to catch something in one beam. Her fingers looking bruised up. Actually, looking more than bruised but rather gray, like the color was being sucked out of them. And her nails were a shiny black in color.<br />
<br />
Though Jenny couldn’t see it, Gloria’s hands were the same. Jenny’s wrists felt like they were growing narrower, while her palms were expanding outward. And her fingers now began to curl up, into a disk like shape. The deep gray of her nails now began to expand over the nails. <br />
<br />
Jenny’s fingers melted into each other, with her thumbs expanding out to form the base of her new hooves. Her palms meanwhile expanded to meet the new hooves, growing into more of a cone like shape.<br />
<br />
Even through the cold air on her body Jenny could feel a pricking coming through her skin. It went up to her wrist and the sensation matched one Jenny had felt across her tail. <br />
<br />
In the back of her mind Jenny knew this was fur. Finally the light emerged again. And Jenny could see her arms crowned with two new hooves.<br />
<br />
Gloria had a matching set. She brayed at Jenny with a sense of joy. <br />
<br />
“I have hooves!” Jenny cried out. “I have Hee-Haw!” She screamed, trying to get the bray to stop. No such luck, another bray escaped Jenny’s throat. <br />
<br />
Later, Jenny and Gloria’s shoulders began to expand in unison. Their chests expanded and their ribs began to barrel out. Human ribs and muscles would no longer due, a new shape was required for their future as pack animals.<br />
<br />
Jenny had had some muscle but not too much. Gloria had been a thin girl all her life. But her thinness disappeared now and was replaced by muscle. Jenny could feel her shoulders and back thickening up as the transformation weaved new muscle under the skin.<br />
<br />
While the jeans the girls wore held together still, their shirts were not so lucky. They were several long rips as these new muscles emerged. Sadly there was no way for Jenny to grab these rips with her hooves. <br />
<br />
“Hee-haw!” All Jenny could do was cry out.Gloria was also crying, but with pleasure. Her eyes were closed and ears pinned against her skull, each bray causing her body to shudder. <br />
<br />
Jenny wanted to clock her but found she was having trouble adjusting her arms. In fact Jenny couldn’t move her shoulders as well as before. She could move her arms back and forth with relative ease. But side to side was proving...difficult to Jenny. What she couldn’t see was that her shoulders were readjusting for a quadruped stance.<br />
<br />
A donkey has no need to stand on two legs. And the legs were what now began to feel funny for Jenny. She couldn’t see it, her shoes were still on for now, but her toes were beginning to morph. From the base of each a dark gray mass sprung from beneath the skin. It emerged like oil, rapidly encasing her extremities. The new hooves didn’t just encase her toes, they replaced them.<br />
<br />
Jenny could feel her feet growing more and more as the hooves consumed them. And then she noticed the bottom cuff of her pants legs growing further away from her shoes.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!?” Jenny screamed. <br />
<br />
Before she could react further a shoe hit her upside the head. Gloria laughed and kicked her now hoof topped legs, sending her other shoe flying out.<br />
<br />
Before Jenny could slap the girl her attention was pulled back to her stretching ankles. Her pants meanwhile began to rip as her thighs exploded with muscle. Jenny brayed in irritation, as her jeans finally ripped to shreds. Now all that remained on Jenny were scraps and her shoes.<br />
<br />
But when Jenny started to walk, her shoes were off of her feet. <br />
<br />
The remaining  jeans was finally tossed off by Jenny’s tail. A part of her was glad to no longer have those irritating, confining garments on her. <br />
<br />
“And I shouldn’t have them on me”, Jenny thought, “because they’d just get in my way. They’d making grazing harder...wait no...”<br />
<br />
Jenny attempted to rub her eyes but succeeded only in hitting herself in the forehead with her hoof.<br />
<br />
“Damn it!” She screamed. Then she started to cry. “I don’t want to be a donkey!” Gloria just shook her head.<br />
<br />
Gloria had lost her speech early on. And now her thoughts were starting to dim. But she had enough thought to see what foolishness this was. <br />
<br />
Gloria was ready to not think anymore, just spend her days braying and grazing. It was time for Jenny to join her. <br />
<br />
Gloria had been on all fours earlier, now Jenny lost her balance and went on all fours too.<br />
<br />
Gloria brayed and grinned. Jenny just continued to cry. Her big teeth and ears, her long tail and hard hooves, none of this made her seem human. <br />
<br />
She was no longer human. She was a donkey and that was all she was ever going to be. <br />
<br />
Jenny kicked at the back wall with her hoof, trying to get out of there. No such luck. They crashed into the river of water full force. Jenny screamed, which only meant her mouth was open. Now came one big mouth full of water. <br />
<br />
The water washed over both their bodies, and in turn it washed the humanity off of them. First went the hair on their heads, or most of it. On the left and right sides it was washed away like dry grass in a flood. All that remained was a long stripe of hair. And then new hairs that began to sprout down their necks. The hair that remained grown much thicker and longer. It stood erect for the most part, much more bristley than what the girls had known before. And it seemed to collect all there maining water, which then slowly flowed out from it.<br />
<br />
Now where the water went, brand new fur sprouted. It was gray brown in most places, very fine and thick to coat. It wasn’t fur, but a complete pelt to keep both young donkey’s dry. The fur around their hooves turned an off white color, and their faces for now remained untouched. <br />
<br />
“I am not going to be a donkey”. Jenny closed her eyes and grit her teeth. She began to feel apressure in her face. Gloria was breathing much harder now. And then She began braying again.“Hee-Haw!” <br />
<br />
As Gloria brayed her face began to puff up. Her nose and lips began being pulled forward, her nose collapsing into her upper lip. Gloria’s nostrils expanded as her nose collapsed, allowing her to take much deeper breaths.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Haw! Heehaw! Heehaw!” Every bray made Gloria’s face push out a little more. This didn’t stop her from braying though. If anything it encouraged it! Gloria’s eyes were pushed towards the sides of her head by the rapidly expanding muzzle. <br />
<br />
Jenny closed her eyes. “I am not going to bray.” Jenny grit her teeth harder as she felt her face expanding. She didn’t need to see it, the feeling of air running across her larger head told her everything.<br />
<br />
Eventually the sensation stopped but Jenny still kept her eyes shut. But finally she could deny it no more. Jenny cracked her eyes open.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” A mass of light gray with deep brown at the base greeted her. “No no no!” Jenny opened her mouth and stuck her huge tongue out. She ran it across her hairy nose, feeling and tasting her brand new nostrils. <br />
<br />
“No no no! No!” Jenny screamed. She then froze. Gloria gave her a sideways glance. <br />
<br />
Then, a woman appeared. “So, did you enjoy the ride, ladies?” She and others behind the wall laughed.<br />
<br />
Jenny’s bigger ears picked up the voice of the woman who had shown them up here. Jenny tried scanning the figures that were slowly coming into focus, looking for the woman.<br />
<br />
“I see her in the back...” Jenny grit her teeth. <br />
<br />
The woman in the front approached Gloria.“And what’s your name?” The woman asked. Gloria cocked her head and brayed.“Hee haw!” <br />
<br />
The woman began to scratch her across the muzzle and held out her hand, offering Gloria a sugar cube. The new donkey accepted it. <br />
<br />
Jenny could just watch this with dread in her heart. Jenny’s friend had earlier been a pale, whiny little turd of a girl. The donkey who leaned into the woman’s scratches and kept swinging her tail in no way resembled a human. <br />
<br />
“She gave in! I won’t do that!” Jenny shook her head. “Not for anything less than an apple!” <br />
<br />
The woman gave Gloria one last tussel of her mane before moving on to Jenny. She leaned in close, allowing the new donkey to get a better view of her tormentor. The woman was rat-faced with patchy red-orange facial hair.<br />
<br />
“So what’s your name?” The woman asked. Jenny growled.<br />
<br />
“Jenny, you ass! Let me out of here!” If Jenny was hoping for surprise or shock from the woman, she was sorely disapointed. Instead the woman just laughed and clapped her hands.<br />
<br />
“We’ve got a speaker!” The others behind the spotlights all laughed now. “Oh and she wants out. Isn’t that funny.”<br />
<br />
“Stop laughing!” Jenny yelled at them. The woman didn’t acknowledge her. <br />
<br />
Gloria brayed at Jenny, possibly to calm her down. Jenny though just kept yelling. “I’m not a donkey, I’m a girl!”<br />
<br />
“You’re not a girl, you’re an ass.” The woman said. “You acted like an ass because inside you were an ass. Your body just corrected itself.” <br />
<br />
The woman gave off a mock bray, and soon all the other men began doing that. Gloria started braying with them, creating a chorus of brays. <br />
<br />
Jenny cringed, causing her big ears to pull back and brush against each other. She reached to cover her ears, only to remember that was impossible. She no longer had hands, much less a way to lift them.<br />
<br />
“Shut up!” Jenny screamed at them. “I-I’m heee! I’m not a donkee-eee-hee-hee!” The woman laughed in Jenny’s face.<br />
<br />
“You’re a big dumb ass.” The woman said. “The soon you accept it the sooner we can send you to a good farm.” <br />
<br />
The woman reached into her pocket and pulled out an apple. Jenny’s eyes went wide. “I bet you want this don’t you.”<br />
“No, I don’t hee-hee-hee-hee waa-ant that.” Jenny stammered. Her breathing was labored and her lungs were burning. Jenny knew what desire she was suppressing. <br />
<br />
And on some level, Jenny knew she was about to break. Every real bray from Gloria or confirmation of her new form by the men wore down her resolve. Now the scent from the apple reached Jenny’s nose. <br />
“It’s so crisp”, said the woman. Unable to stop herself, Jenny’s tongue darted out of her mouth. “I know you want it.” The woman slowly moved the apple just out of Jenny’s reach.<br />
<br />
“Just give in. You’ll be happy.”<br />
<br />
 Jenny shook her head. “I----I” Jenny swallowed, “I----“<br />
<br />
“You are a donkey!” The woman yelled, causing Jenny’s ears to stand erect. “Say it!” <br />
<br />
<br />
Jenny began to sob.“Heeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaww!” Jenny brayed. “Heee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!” Hee-haw!” As Jenny brayed the final changes came over her. Her vocal cords were changing and her human mind was becoming a donkey’s one with every bray.<br />
The human in front of her had an apple. She held up the apple, allowing Jenny to bite into it. The apple mattered.<br />
“Good girl.” The woman said, rubbing Jenny’s neck as she ate. She gestured to the others, two of whom approached Jenny and Gloria with ropes.<br />
<br />
“Put these two in the same crate,” the woman said. She took a moment to look down on the new donkeys. “They came here together, they should stay together.”</p>
