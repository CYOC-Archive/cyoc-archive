<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Muxing wasn&#39;t that keen on the Bare as You Dare competition, and thus ran a bit counter to the rest of the Five Elements  on the matter, they did remain united on SAMAS. And since both competitions and displays of skill went on at the same time there was to some degree of overlap between them. And to a certain extent, Muxing took advantage of that. She returned to the SAMAS events and dressed comfortable and calm exercise gear. She figured the work out and practice would let her relieve a little of her stress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know WHY they&#39;d think it&#39;s fun to run around in their underwear!&quot; Muxing thought to herself as she carefully made her way into the booth at SAMAS that had been set up for the Five Elements to showcase what progress they&#39;d made with their own skills.<br />
<br />
None of the elements were masters, yet, but their conversion had already attracted some attention and particularly from some martial arts enthusiasts as well. Some of it struck Muxing as some of the same sort of advertising that the Bare as You Dare Competition was deliberately playing to, but in this specific case it would play more to mental discipline and skill rather than who looked good in lingerie. And to a certain extent, practicing one&#39;s skills was more important than posing and dancing in one&#39;s underwear. And that though and &quot;image&quot; that related to the Bare as You Dare competition frustrated her and she couldn&#39;t hide her frustration at it, even though she did know that her sisters had been adjusting well to Animalia and many of its other aspects. <br />
<br />
There were even times when some of the activities didn&#39;t have that sort of sexual overtone that the Bare as You Dare competition did, and Muxing did quite well with those. But the Bare as You Dare competition DID seem to trigger her, along with many of the other parts of Animalia that had similar &quot;tones&quot; to it seemed to trigger that response. Many times Muxing knew she was reacting poorly too it, but she couldn&#39;t help it. The things that the cult did were things she despised with a passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You doing okay, Muxing?&quot; came an adult feminine voice from nearby as she began her warm ups on the mat that had been provided for the elements to use.<br />
<br />
Muxing looked up to see the Panda Animalian who&#39;d been part of the efforts to help Muxing and her sisters, Ping. Ping stood there quietly as she looked to Muxing, though she had a bag of celery in one hand. Ping&#39;s other hand was raising a celery stalk up to where Ping could take a bite from it. Muxing could easily hear the snap and crackle as Ping chewed on the snack that she&#39;d brought, though celery wouldn&#39;t be quite as impressive as the bamboo that Pandas normally ate in the wild, though the celery might also be more nutritious than bamboo, not that Muxing, as a carnivorous snake Animalian could eat either.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing fine,&quot; Muxing answered to Ping and threw another practice punch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Ping asked, &quot;as you seem a little frustrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Muxing did look frustrated. She&#39;d been on her way to look into some of the events at SAMAS when she saw Muxing slither in ahead of her and with a slight frown on her face. More importantly to Ping, her sisters were not present. The group had generally been recovering fairly well in Animalia, and their Tiger and Snow Leopard members were more than happy to talk with and even &quot;coach&quot; Tuxing and Jinxing on things from time to time, and even Shuixing had made some friends with some Animalia&#39;s bovine residents. But of them, Muxing was the quietest, and while Ping might not be as skilled with psychology as someone like Doctor Jones, Ping did get the sense that Muxing was still affected by what had happened to her and her sisters before they joined Animalia. Thus, when Ping saw Muxing moving alone, she got a bit nervous that something might have happened that put some stress on Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I&#39;m a little frustrated with the others hanging out around the Bare as You Dare competition,&quot; Muxing answered, &quot;I mean... after everything that happened...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not wish to be in something that would remind you of that, correct?&quot; Ping asked, referring to the cult that had held Muxing and her sisters prisoner as she watched Muxing go through some of her exercises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just that... but why would the others think that&#39;s fun?&quot; Muxing asked, &quot;I mean there is a fair amount of underwear that specifically made to be taken off. I tried to make that point and they argued about a swimsuit I wore on Mieni.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some swimsuits may have some of the same purposes as some forms of underwear,&quot; Ping commented, &quot;the only difference being that a swimsuit can go in water whereas underwear isn&#39;t supposed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but...&quot; Muxing began, &quot;that doesn&#39;t mean I need to unwind the same way they do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; Ping commented, &quot;&quot;but it would seem that you are taking on additional stress. Almost as if you want them to relax the way you would relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I want,&quot; Muxing answered and threw another practice punch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what DO you want?&quot; Ping asked her and slowly approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d want them to recognize that what happened... was hard and traumatic,&quot; Muxing answered, &quot;and that we shouldn&#39;t be enjoying things that the guys that grabbed us would want to do... that...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ping watched as Muxing visibly shuddered and then slowly made her way toward Ping. In this she had the sense that Muxing was struggling heavily with what had happened to her and her sisters. On certain levels she half expected that and that giving the things that the Five Elements had dealt with before they were rescued. It was something that Ping recognized was truly what bothered Muxing. It was why Pin had tried to get Muxing to see Doctor Jones from time to time, though Muxing had tended to be resistant of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you know that your sisters have recovered from what happened and that they wouldn&#39;t want to go back to that situation,&quot; Ping said to Muxing.<br />
<br />
Muxing didn&#39;t resist as Ping came forward and actually hugged her. It was more than just relaxation and those sorts of things. In this Muxing then hugged Ping back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s tough,&quot; Muxing admitted, &quot;the others are stronger with that sort of thing... But every time I find myself running into anything that... that reminds me of things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Ping answered, &quot;It&#39;s why I&#39;ve urged you to talk with Doctor Jones on this issue. He can help you with getting those things under control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why do other things not have that effect?&quot; Muxing asked. &quot;I didn&#39;t have this problem on Mieni when swimming.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ping held Muxing close and patted the back of the Chinese Tree Viper Animalian and at the same time Muxing felt comforted by it as well. In many ways Muxing knew her sisters were right in that stress could be a problem. And privately she was glad that her sisters were doing better, but she couldn&#39;t picture as to why she was struggling with this or with anything like this. As just about anything that came off as sexual seemed to irritate her and agitate her, reminding her of the abuses that the cult had put on all of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were in a stressful place,&quot; Ping said softly, &quot;and it&#39;s understandable that you would be nervous with regards to certain elements about Animalia that may remind you of that. You just have to remember that no one in Animalia will EVER abuse you and that there are people who can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Doctor Jones?&quot; Muxing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or one of the others that he&#39;s recently hired... if they&#39;ve started, yet,&quot; Ping answered, &quot;they can help you retain control and keep your cool as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I get cool, I&#39;d slow down,&quot; Muxing answered, with a slight bit of humor coming into her voice, which relieved Ping a bit.<br />
<br />
Muxing wasn&#39;t exactly the most comedic out of the Five Elements, but everyone could have a potential sense of humor and to Ping, that was something could provide some stress relief. The fact that Muxing did make an attempt at humor in that moment gave Ping some assurance that Muxing was doing better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then stay warm... but not stressed,&quot; Ping told Muxing, &quot;because not you can&#39;t keep letting things that are sexual get to you... Because one day, you may find someone that you love very much. What will you do then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try better with the sessions with Doctor Jones,&quot; Muxing promised, &quot;and hope that if I do meet someone who wants to be my mate... that he&#39;d be patient with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all anyone could ask for,&quot; Ping answered</p>
