<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The wire mesh separating them from the freedom they desired, Jeff leaned against it, whilst Alan fumbled about, trying to figure out how to get it up. Cursing mentally at his inability to get a hold of the spring-latches, Alan soon ceased when he was doing. Looking at the window, pissed it was turning into another dead-end, he glanced over at Jeff and though { any idea what else we can do }<br />
<br />
From where he sat, Jeff at first didn&#39;t hear Alan. Disheartened to have gotten so far, and yet couldn&#39;t even manage to take the last step to their freedom, he wondered if it might not be for the best to wait out the forty-eight hours. Thinking of Riley, of dropping off the bookcase and crawling back toward the bed to lay next to it and wait for the girl to pick him up off the floor, he startled from his musings when a voice cut in with { hey, are you listening to me }<br />
<br />
At first, he couldn&#39;t seem to work who was speaking. Feeling jumbled, it took everything he had to put things together. It slow to come the plush raccoon had asked him something, the plush otter focused as best as they could on them. Discovering they could recall their name, and instead kept thinking of them by the name Riley had given them, Jeff grew concerned there was something wrong with him. Believing it must in some way have to do with becoming a plush toy, Jeff shifted in place and thought { sorry } { I spaced there for a second } and deciding to keep what was troubling him to himself, he inquired { you were asking something }<br />
<br />
{ yeah } Alan shot back. { I wanted to know if you had any idea of what we could do }<br />
<br />
The answer seeming obvious, Jeff wanted to tell the other they ought to go back to where they&#39;d been left and wait for Riley to wake up. Struggling to not tell the other this, Jeff focused on the screen and gave it his full attention. Looking at it, the way it was held in place, the way it was raised and lowered, he soon discovered he didn&#39;t have a clue. About to tell the plush raccoon this, he instead thought { freeze }<br />
<br />
{ what is it } Alan returned, a hint of panic in his psychic-sent thoughts as he did as Jeff had said to do.<br />
<br />
Again, Jeff didn&#39;t reply right away. Peering out the window, waiting, it took him a moment before his glass eyes picked up on what he thought he saw. Wondering how long the person had been there, he watched as a they stealthy crept nearer. Stopping, they leaned closer and peered at Jeff and Alan, and for a brief moment, the plush otter was certain they&#39;d been seen moving about. But then, the figure reached down and took something out of their pocket. Applying it to the screen, they dragged it down, and listening to the sound of wire mesh parting, Jeff grasped they&#39;d withdrawn a cutting tool. Watching as they finished, growing scared, though not so much for his sake, but for Riley&#39;s, Jeff wondered what he could do as the person finished slicing away the screen.<br />
<br />
The area before them now open, neither one of the plush dared to move as the burglar tossed aside the wire mesh. Alan thinking { should we do something } Jeff wanted to shake his head, but kept still as the person began climbing inside. A hand knocking into him, Jeff was certain the girl would wake when the intruder whispered, &quot;The fuck...&quot; and grasping first Jeff, then Alan, he hissed something like, &quot;Fuckin&#39; toys,&quot; before tossing the two plush not onto the floor but out the window.<br />
<br />
Landing on a roof jutting out from the house, which both thought might be over a porch, it was Alan who first commented { well, we&#39;re outside }<br />
<br />
With a single word agreement, the plush otter forced itself up. Looking up at the window they&#39;d been thrown from, the first thing to cross Jeff&#39;s batting mind was they had to go back in and find a way to stop the home invader. Thinking { do you think we should do something about the burglar first before leaving }<br />
<br />
{ and what would you suggest we do } Alan retorted. { in case you&#39;ve forgotten, you&#39;re a plush otter wearing a nightgown and I&#39;m a plush raccoon dressed like a baby }<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t forgotten this, and wanting to point this out, Jeff instead remained silent. Overcome with a longing to go back to Riley, as a part of him insisted he belonged to the little girl, he was alarmed by such a notion, as well as to discover there were small snippets of his life as Jeff now missing, most connect to Riley, who his mind insisted was not his sister, but the girl who cuddled with him, dressed and played with him, for whom he’d been a birthday gift. Struggling against these thoughts, believing there had to be something wrong with them, he listened as Alan psychically projected the message { we should get going }<br />
<br />
Certain his friend was right, and being a plush was actually getting to him, Jeff tried to tell himself it&#39;d all be for the better the further away he got from Riley, as well as it&#39;d be all right once they were able to reuse the Chronivac. Turning away, he followed the plush raccoon across the roof, and upon reaching the edge, listened as they thought { how do we get down }<br />
<br />
{ like this } Jeff thought, and before Alan could reply, Jeff nudged him off the roof. Hearing his friend swear as they landing in the bushes below, Jeff would have smiled if he could. But, unable to do this, he instead settled for leaping from the roof to the foliage below.</p>
