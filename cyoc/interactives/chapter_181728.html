<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I make little clothing change earlier and it worked,” Ying said. “Not sure I have to change clothes back or if rule only applies to changes to me personally. I still have clothing change so we see if I can still make changes.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see anything different in what you’re wearing. Excuses ... excuses, we both know magic is impossible,” Richard said.<br />
<br />
“Change not where you can see. We be standing up so I wear mid thigh little black dress with red platform stilettos.” Ying grinned as she watched Richard.<br />
<br />
Richard’s mouth dropped open in amazement when his impetuous coworker was suddenly dressed in a gorgeous black dress. He found himself taking a short step backward due to her sudden additional height as a result of the incredible shoes she now had on. Ying was always fairly tall for a woman, but on those shoes she now stood several inches taller than him. Her skimpy dress accentuated her small breasts and her increased height made them even more provocative. He’d always tried to treat Ying as a coworker, he of course knew she was a woman, but she’d never really dressed to be noticed, but damn, she was hot!<br />
<br />
Ying was pleased with the effect she was having on Richard. Not only was the surprise fun, she could also tell he was becoming aroused. ‘Yes, this would be fun,’ she confirmed to herself.<br />
<br />
“But how,” Richard stammered?<br />
<br />
“Himeros, just like it said. Now I dress you. Men are easy, I put you in nice charcoal grey suit, black dress shoes, and red tie to match my shoes.” <br />
<br />
“Holy crap,” Richard yelped when he suddenly found himself redressed. “This is impossible, but it’s undeniable. Do you think the other things it alluded to are real too, should we try it?”<br />
<br />
“I think we try it, but I’m hungry. Let’s go get some food.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m hungry too. But I still wish we could try some stuff right away, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, we eat and and try stuff. Ready?”<br />
<br />
Richard was often thrown by Ying’s phrasing but decided it was unimportant as he looked up at her.<br />
<br />
Holding Richards eyes, Ying decided to drop her platform stilettos down to no platform and less heel rise, dropping her standing height down about three inches. Simultaneously she silently commanded Richard to become three inches shorter so their relative gazes remained unchanged. Holding her gaze on Richard, she also held her breath. After several seconds she decided she’d gotten away with it and decided to go for an intangible. Struggling to keep a smirk from her face at Richard not realizing she’d shrunk him, she decided it would be fun if during their schmooze and hors d’oeuvres, Richard could enjoy the pleasure of being as sexually attracted to men as he was to women. “Shall we go?” she said waving toward the door. She smiled thinking about Richard having twice the arousal problem. As she followed behind him heading for the door, she decided it would be even better if Richard’s slacks were a little stretchy and a little snug. From her position behind him she couldn’t really see any change, so just before he got to the door, she decided that he needed a fuller rounder butt, not a big butt, a feminine butt.<br />
<br />
Ying giggled, wondering how long it would take for Richard to figure it out.<br />
<br />
“Care to share,” Richard asked?<br />
<br />
“I just enjoying the view.”<br />
<br />
As Richard entered the elevator and selected the mezzanine level, things seemed off somehow, but he told himself it was his imagination. Feeling slightly self conscious walking next to Ying in her tall shoes as they entered the buffet area, Richard was relieved when she nodded to him and headed off in a different direction. Spying a high table of seafood, Richard headed in that direction. Collecting a plate, Richard selectively loaded his plate and carried it over to another high table with several other people already  present who were chatting and eating. As he set his plate down, a remarkably tall server paused to offer a tray of wine. Richard felt himself becoming aroused as she flirtatiously held the tray low and bent slightly forward, giving him an impressive view. <br />
<br />
Flushing, Richard put his wine glass on the table and looked at his temporary table mates. There were three attractive women, two of which stood taller than he did in their heels with the third barely shorter than himself. There was only one guy, but he was really tall and incredibly good looking. His voice and smile was captivating. Surreptitiously looking around to make sure no one was looking, Richard reached below the table and adjusted his now throbbing erection. <br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m Nina and this is Kira, Sasha, and Dimitri,” the shortest one said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh … I’m Richard,” Richard stammered and held out his hand.<br />
<br />
“Oooh ... Richard,” the three women singsonged together as Sasha hip bumped Dimitri.<br />
<br />
“Do not pay attention to them. They have always been deranged,” Dimitri said taking Richrd’s offered hand.<br />
<br />
Richard found himself flummoxed as Dimitri explained that the other three were his sisters and constantly teased him. What confused him was that Dimitri continued to hold his hand all during the explanation and Richard had no desire to let go. In fact he was disappointed when Dimitri finally released him. Not that he could have done anything about it, he told himself, as Dimitri while gentle was so much bigger and more powerful than himself.</p>
