<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boss got to work early, and noticed the smells in the building. He thinks the smells are nice, but knows the place didn't smell like that <br />
before, so he looks around and sees the young woman in her cubical. <br />
<br />
He asks her about the smells.<br />
<br />
She pretends to not know anything about it, but he sees through her, and soon as he sees others showing up, he asks to speak with him alone <br />
in his office.<br />
<br />
Once inside, he shuts the door, asks her to take a seat, and he walks around speaking to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you realize why I've brought you here?&quot; he asks &quot;You thought you could just do as you pleased. We have rules for a reason. If I let you do <br />
this, then all my employees will think they can do whatever they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like stole anything.&quot; she said, trying to defend herself &quot;Besides, don't you think it smells nicer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it does.&quot; he said, taking in the aroma &quot;It brings back memories of being back on the barn helping my parents - NRG!&quot; he shook his head <br />
&quot;Don't ... try to change the subject.&quot; he sat down in the seat across from her, and rubbed his forehead &quot;Do you realize the gravity of this <br />
situation?&quot; he asked, as his ears got pointy. The young woman's ears also got pointy. She saw his ears, and felt her own. &quot;Sir,&quot; she said, as their <br />
ears got pointier, and moved up their heads &quot;I think there's a bigger issue I must address.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; he asked as his ears got longer on top of his <br />
head, and hers got longer on top of hers, but not as long as his &quot;You want to wear a tissue mustard dress?&quot; &quot;That's not what I -&quot; she was cut off <br />
by a presser at the base of her spine. She got up and looked just in time to see a horse tail burst out the back as her hips widened out. The <br />
boss saw this, and went over for a better look. He looked at it closely, and tried to touch it, but she swished his hand away. &quot;Bad boy.&quot; she said, <br />
smiling seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; he said smiling, as a donkey tail burst out the back of his pants &quot;Now what were we talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young woman smiled, and chose to take advantage of this chance. &quot;You were talking about how nice the office smells now,&quot; she said, as <br />
their noses flattened out &quot;and you were about to give me a raise.&quot; she said smiling as her face pushed out into a short horse muzzle and his <br />
pushed out into a donkey muzzle. &quot;I was?&quot; he asked, as their finger nails turned black, and their fingers fused so on each hand they now had 3 <br />
fingers and a thumb. &quot;Yes.&quot; she replied with a confident smile &quot;Now why don't I give you a nice foot massage to seal the deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he said, thinking about it &quot;my feet DO  feel sore all of a sudden.&quot; So they went down on the floor. She took off her shoes and leggings, <br />
and removed his shoes and socks. She started massaging his feet, and as she did, both hers and his feet turned into hooves, and their legs <br />
became reverse-jointed. When she was done, they got up, and he saw that not only had her breasts doubled in size, but before he had been <br />
taller - now she stood an entire 2 feet taller than him! Fur grew and covered their entire bodies, and their transformations were now done. He <br />
was now a donkey-man, and she was now a horse-woman!<br />
<br />
He looked up at her dumbly &quot;Gosh, yer purrty!&quot; he said with a stupid grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not so bad yourself.&quot; she said with a seductive smile. With that, she picked him up, and kissed him passionately on the lips with a loud <br />
smack. &quot;WOO! HOT-DIGGETY!&quot; he said, as she set him back down. &quot;Ya sure know how ta treat a fellah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So will you give me a raise?&quot; she asked seductively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; he said, smiling with a thumbs-up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And will you let me buy a water cooler and have me reimbursed?&quot; she asked again in the same tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-E-Thang for a purrty filly like yerself!&quot; he said smiling with 2 thumbs-up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; she said, patting him on the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's a bit of interest.&quot; he said, handing her an apple &quot;And here's my number.&quot; he continued, handing her his cell number on a small yellow <br />
note &quot;Call me anytime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, heading out the door, then turning her head back at him said with a bedroom face &quot;It's been a pleasure doing business with <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise.&quot; he said smiling. She blew him a kiss, and trotted out the door back towards her cubical, letting her wider hips sway seductively back <br />
and forth.<br />
<br />
All the others were anthro barn animals too. Oddly enough, their clothes still fit, and even though they knew they had changed, they didn't <br />
panic. In fact, they liked it. The young horse-woman sat back down, and continued her work with renewed enthusiasm. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said to <br />
herself as she started &quot;things are going to get much better around here!&quot;</p>
