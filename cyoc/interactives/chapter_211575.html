<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You raised your camera and snapped a photo of a black-haired young adult who’s wearing a knitted blue chullo hat with a yellow puff on top. The guy has a light tan and he’s got sharp features to his black eyes and chin. You’re pretty sure you can’t call yourself a fashion aficionado, but the guy speaks volumes about a comfortable-core fashion sense. He wears a thick sea-blue sweater and a pair of rich black pants. Besides, the guy was this other blonde-haired boy, and they seem to be kissing each other. <br />
<br />
“If this app of yours is real, I can’t think of a reason why you’d be in an old guy’s body,” Finn said. “Guys his age are starting to get real responsibilities. The very same responsibilities you’re trying to avoid. Why not a kid? Or some rich pain-in-the-ass executive back in the office?”<br />
<br />
“I thought about becoming a child, but I don’t think I can handle puberty again.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, whatever floats your boat. Not like this is going to work anyway…” <br />
<br />
You continue on with the rest of the day in the monotonous hell machine that you call accounting, it leaves your mind with plenty of space for you to think of the possibilities of tomorrow. When you snapped the guy’s picture, you felt strange energies emanate from the phone and jump straight to your head. You heard far-off whispers in languages arcane and unknown. Deciphering them seems useless. The day ended with your thoughts preoccupied with tomorrow. You closed your eyes and dozed off to a deep wakeless sleep…<br />
<br />
&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;&#65099;<br />
It’s strange waking up comfortably in your own bed. This is what sleep should be. But days of back-breaking work leave you with no such pleasure. You’d often wake up with a painful back and sore shoulders. Headache bounces on the walls of your head, sending pangs of pain whenever it hits a wall. But now… There’s barely any pain if you discount the uncomfortable feeling in your groin. You opened your eyes and saw an unfamiliar ceiling. You turned around to see an unfamiliar room. There is a balcony on the right, and you realized that you’re in a high-story condominium. You left the bed to look for the nearest mirror.<br />
<br />
In the reflection, you saw your new face. Pale-skinned with sharp black eyes. Your equally dark hair is kept short and combed neatly. Not even a long night&#39;s sleep could ruin your neat hairstyle. You looked at your body. Your arms are long but they aren&#39;t as thin as you expected. There are muscles in them, much more than what common metabolism could give. This guy lifts weights, and your hypothesis was proven correct when you saw a dedicated weights section in the corner of the room. You removed your clothes. Goodbye fat and decaying stomach. Your stomach is hella toned! There’s no muffin top on the top rim of your pajamas. They fit and they’re tight. There’s a definitive V-line that leads down your crotch. You cupped your groin and felt a meager weight in them. No wonder this place felt so tight when you woke up. <br />
<br />
You returned to your bed and picked up your phone. It briefly showed a lock screen before unlocking when it detected your face. Immediately on the home screen, you saw the “Swap Snap” app had somehow installed itself on this guy’s phone. You opened it and got immediate congrats from the lion mascot.<br />
<br />
“Congrats on possessing your new body! I hope you’re enjoying the experience.” Aside from the photo function, a new button had appeared. It leads to a customer service function, but you didn’t bother touching it since you have no queries at the moment.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you were hit by this painful pang in your head. It’s much worse than the headache you used to feel in your old body. It’s somewhat of a blessing that it left as soon as it came. But not before leaving you with a crucial gift that would make you fit in Craig’s life. Yes… That is your name. Craig Matthews is a 20-year-old accountancy student who hails from a somewhat rich family. No wonder he could afford a solo condominium. Your new life is somewhat of a spectacle. Even at a young age, everyone considers him handsome. There’s never a day without girls clutching his arms. He didn’t really care about popularity. He lived his days as normally as they can get. That was until he met his first and current boyfriend, Theo Donovan. Craig’s day brightens up whenever he’s with him. <br />
<br />
But amid all that… you have a class in half an hour. You took a quick shower. As much as you’d like to masturbate with this larger penis of yours, you barely had time. You grabbed a can of cold coffee from your refrigerator and took a train to your campus.<br />
<br />
It’s strange knowing that you’re studying again. Craig is quite the studious guy, and that’s why you easily absorbed this morning’s lesson and found perfect application in the given assignment. Although, you know you’re also using your prior accountancy knowledge and skills. You used it to thoroughly answer your professor’s recitations and even got praise from one. You expected commendations from your classmates, but it seems this is already normal for Craig. <br />
<br />
At lunch, you hid in the bathroom stall and made contact with Finn through his social media. He must have seen your profile picture and connected it to the guy you snapped a photo with yesterday. He replied immediately with a question mark. And you replied with a picture of yourself, your thumb pulling your uniform upwards while your pants are pulled down. Your long and throbbing dick arcs upwards. The mere blow of the vent above was enough to make it leak with pre-cum. There’s a cheeky smile on your face, and it was made even naughtier when you pulled your tongue out. You know that this is not the kind of look Craig would dare make his entire life. But now you’re in the reins and you can do whatever you want in this body. <br />
<br />
“Told you the app is real,” You messaged Finn. <br />
<br />
Finn started a video call which you immediately accepted. He has a high position on the company ladder and that is why he has his own office. His face is pink and flustered, and excitement is clearly visible on his face.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t tell me this is an elaborate prank, you and Eugene cooked up.”<br />
<br />
“We’ve spent decades working together. When have I pranked you? And do you really think a college guy is willing to show his penis just to prank a total stranger?” You grabbed the shaft of your penis and jerked it off. You’re waiting for this since you felt the sheer size of your new penis. Fuck! The additional length is so weird yet exhilarating. “Wo- would someone just jerk off for a stranger? No, right?”<br />
<br />
“Okay… okay… I believe you. But fuck! This is surreal.” You heard him unzipping his pants. It seems seeing your flustered face is doing wonders for him. “Ca– can you zoom in on your dick? I want to see it.”<br />
<br />
You moved the camera closer to your dick, while your other hand made longer strides just to rub the entirety of your penis. This is what… twice? Twice and a half as long as your older penis? It pains you to know that a mere college student has you beat in the downstairs department. But why do you even care? You have this body. This is now your dick. And holy fuck was jerking this monstrosity the best thing that happened in your life. In the silence of your cubicle, you began to moan. Gah! Your body is aflame with pleasure. Needles continuously prick you which sends electrifying shivers to every inch of your muscles. Your head leaned back, and your Adam&#39;s apple bobbed with every moan. The journey was gradual but the climax hit you like a 6-tonne truck. Screams bubbled out of you, as thick and hot lobules emptied on the bathroom floor. However, some had splashed on the bathroom door and one drop came crashing up the ceiling. You emptied your seed like a torrential river. You’ve scanned Craig’s mind and it seems he hasn’t had a release for quite some time now. It’s such a joy that you were the one to release this immense pleasure. On the other end, it seems Finn was also cumming. You could hear his deep gravelly moans, and it made you even harder amid your release.<br />
<br />
After that whole ordeal, Finn asked to meet you after his shift. It’s by luck that it coincidentally matches with the time you leave school. You cleaned after yourself and left the stall. But it seems somebody had heard your moans. It’s a high schooler from a department attached to your campus. His face is all red and grew even flustered when he saw your equally pink handsome face. You looked down to see his pants dripping with cum. It’s nice knowing that your moans are enough to make a gay man cum. You smiled at him but he flinched and escaped the restroom. <br />
<br />
While returning to your class, you got another message. This time from Theo. He’s asking where you are and why you haven’t picked him up this morning like you usually do. You were too preoccupied with going to school that you forgot to see that part of Craig’s memories. Theo’s a little mad but a date this afternoon can make his mood better. Maybe a trip to the arcade? Or simply go to the park again and cuddle while the public is watching. What did you choose?</p>
