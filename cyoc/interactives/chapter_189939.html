<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;First of all,&quot; she began. &quot;<i>Nothing</i> either of you says or does will turn me back into that fat Yankee girl, <i>ever,</i> or anything else. You will release any power you have over me. <i>Now.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I release all power I have over you,&quot; both said in unison. &quot;Nothing I do will affect you, ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God,&quot; she breathed in relief. For the first time since spotting the house, she relaxed a little. &quot;Now... stop fucking that girl and sit up. Both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They obeyed, Lee looking a little unhappy, even in trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you transform your friend into that girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mistress,&quot; answered Tom dully. Destiny facepalmed with an irate sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bloody fucking...&quot; She took a deep breath, then lowered her hand to study the girl. She was very white, with a typical blonde bimbo look. Given the difference in taste, Destiny guessed that it was the now-girl who had turned her into a stripper from... whatever she had been. Maybe this was karma for that.<br />
<br />
But still, she felt a little bad for the girl, being hypnotised into servicing this jerk. Not nearly as angry as Sarah would have been -- as a sex worker, Destiny saw nothing demeaning in having your brains fucked out. So long as both parties <i>agreed</i> to it -- which they couldn&#39;t very well do if one of them were brainwashed, could they? <i>That</i> made her pretty mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here, girl,&quot; she said, rather kindly despite her anger. Lee got up, walking over and letting Destiny pull her into a half-embrace with one arm, while she still lazily swung the coin back and forth with her free hand. &quot;Did he hurt you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Destiny raised an eyebrow. &quot;Did you want to be transformed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no... but I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. Is that the truth?&quot;<br />
<br />
A few seconds of hesitation, then Lee nodded. &quot;Yes. I like being master&#39;s slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph.&quot; But Destiny patted her shoulder. &quot;Well, you are prettier as a girl. Now -- both of you -- tell me your names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your <i>real</i> name, girl. Before he transformed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee grimaced. Her voice was strained, almost as if she was in pain. &quot;I... I can&#39;t, mistress. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Destiny asked, surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because master told me to forget everything except that I was his slave girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slave...!&quot; Destiny choked back her anger. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Lee. I release you from your former master. Tom no longer has any power over you. You no longer have to obey his commands.&quot;<br />
<br />
The strain eased from Lee&#39;s face. Destiny patted her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, let&#39;s start again. What <i>was</i> your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl! And... do you <i>really</i> like being a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The prompt reply convinced Destiny. After all, who would know better than the stripper how great it was to be female? She hugged the younger woman close. &quot;Then you can stay a girl. Do you like the name &#39;Lee?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Not really, mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to call me that. I&#39;m just your friend. You may call me Destiny. And what would you like to be named?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wisteria, Ms. Destiny. &#39;Rissy&#39; for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
Destiny blinked at the rather unusual choice, which also came with surprising promptness. &quot;Have you... thought about being a girl before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Ms. Destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, just &#39;Destiny.&#39;&quot; The stripper laughed, but it ended in a cough. She had let herself get distracted, but she still had business of her own to attend to. She turned her attention back to the boy sitting on the boy, his cock now limp between his legs. Still lost in trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me everything that happened. Starting from when you found this coin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom told her -- everything he could. After all, he&#39;d only first seen the coin when he and Sarah had come into Brad&#39;s house. But it was enough for now. Destiny&#39;s grip on Rissy slackened, and she leaned against the doorframe.<br />
<br />
Much to her relief, she did <i>not</i> turn back into Sarah when she heard her old name this time. She did feel giddy for a moment, as Sarah&#39;s memories rushed back upon her. But mixed up with all the teen angst, shame over her body, and annoyance with her male friends, was a desire to be a strong, powerful, confident woman. A desire that found perfect fulfillment in Destiny.<br />
<br />
The two personas merged; the stripper shaking her head, disdain for &quot;that fat Yankee chick&quot; melting into fond acceptance of what she had been. And Sarah snuggled down into the Anglo-Indian&#39;s heart, enjoying the dreamy memories of a fantasy past that had become her new reality. The coin&#39;s spell was broken, the trigger phrase gone, leaving the stripper free to live her life. Truly, this was Destiny.<br />
<br />
And she was <i>so</i> relieved to have actual family and friends again. Even though she felt a little detached from them -- well, most of them. Like many teenagers, Sarah had felt increasingly alienated from her parents and pressured by her friends. And there was still a bit of fall-out from her false memories to clean up, though she had no fear that she could deal with it.<br />
<br />
Tom finished by explaining how Brad had been a wimp -- feeling sorry for Sarah and not wanting to use the coin. And how he, Tom, had taken it upon himself to capitalise upon the opportunity. He even confessed to his plan to build a harem of mind-controlled slave girls.<br />
<br />
Destiny laughed, rather grimly. &quot;Well, as it happens, I <i>do</i> prefer being Destiny to being Sarah. But you had no right to change me like that, and your friend is not a &#39;wimp&#39; to feel bad about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again she hugged Rissy. Hearing about Brad&#39;s remorse and reluctance to use the coin again -- and that the initial mess with her identity had been a mistake -- made her feel that much closer to the girl Brad had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rissy, you&#39;re a true friend. I&#39;m going to release you from trance now. When I snap my fingers, you -- Rissy, and ONLY Rissy -- will wake up and remember everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Snap.</i><br />
<br />
Tom started, but remained entranced. Rissy, however, blinked. &quot;What...&quot; A deluge of memories assaulted her suddenly-conscious mind. Brad, Lee, Rissy -- who was she? She looked back and forth between Tom and Destiny. &quot;I -- I... don&#39;t... what? Tom! What the hell...!?&quot;<br />
<br />
A burst of tears prevented her from saying any more, and she collapsed into the stripper, wrapping her arms around her and sobbing into her side. Destiny petted her, glaring at Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what you&#39;ve done, you worm?&quot; she demanded. The naked boy actually looked a bit sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve hurt her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you have. And you <i>will</i> pay for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of the anger that had formerly been boiling around the threat to <i>her</i> identity was now redirected at Tom. However, seeing the hint of contrition he felt -- and remembering all the good times they had together -- she wasn&#39;t sure what she would actually <i>do</i> to him. After all, things had turned out okay -- both she and Rissy had ended up liking their changes.<br />
<br />
She could even understand the male&#39;s hankering for polygyny. The sex worker was well acquainted with male fantasies and had no issue with them. But he had caved to the temptation to fulfill those fantasies in a less than ethical way. Now that she had the power...</p>

How would she punish him?</h3>
