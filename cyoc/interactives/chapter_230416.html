<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan was playing idly with her new much more smooth and darker mermaid hair, while the now mermaid Matt lied beside her on one side stretching out a bit and with a look on her face that begged to have a cigarette in her lips after a wonderful sexual encounter. Amber lay on her side on the other side of Susan her radiant red and gold tail pulled up a bit into a fetal position while she used one arm as a headrest. A wide smile crossed her face as she seemed to be on the edge of going to sleep.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her eyes shot open as did everyone’s else as they heard the sound of police siren coming from outside the restaurant/bar. <br />
<br />
“Time to go.” Said Matt as she began to pull herself across the ground toward the small pool and the door that led out into the ocean. That door was design to allow the women who used this room to get into their mermaid costumes before swimming out to meet guests, now three true mermaids swam out that door into the darkness of the night and ocean.<br />
<br />
However, it wasn’t dark, far from it.<br />
<br />
Their eyes saw through the darkness with ease, they saw just as well in the ocean now as they could whenever they stuck their heads above the water to see through the air. <br />
<br />
The ocean was alive with merfolk, both mermaids and merman, however even at a glance it was clear that there were far more mermaids than merman. <br />
<br />
It was also clear that every one of them fell into one of three camps when it came to what had to be done.<br />
<br />
Susan saw a mermaid just floating there in the water, her long jet-black hair was a wonder on itself but her tail reminded her of a koi fish, a stunning mix of white, black and a bright orange. She was wearing the remains of one of the Mermaid cove bar shirts that they sold at the gift shop. She was floating in the water with a look on her face like she was trying to process what had happened to her and was currently failing. She wasn’t doing anything, too stunned to do anything. She was far from the only one in that state, almost a 1/3rd of the people where in that state or sitting on the ocean floor crying or attempting to pull off the tail or calling out for help. That told them that they could speak and hear underwater.<br />
<br />
 A part of that group in Susan&#39;s head was those figures who Susan saw where still in the middle of transforming, she saw a man who was clearing becoming a mermaid who still had her human legs but where now covered with bright lime green scales and his hair was changing colors into an equally bright lime green color. Breasts where growing out at the same time his dick was shrinking. Beside him was a women going the other way, her breasts where shrinking in as a dick was pushing out. Her legs had merged together and scales had appeared but they where still flesh color. <br />
<br />
The second group they saw were like what Susan, Matt and Amber had been only a couple minutes ago, they were lost in pleasure. A merman liked in the sand, his shark-like tail looking like it belonged to a leopard shark was pleasuring himself. Susan didn’t know if his dick had been that size before but now it was something impressive. He wasn’t alone, while others were enjoying themselves in a state of semi-private others where openly having sex. They swam pass two mermaids who were lost in pleasure and then they saw a group of mermaids and merman lying on the sand in a semi-circle. That was confusing enough at first then they saw a mermaid, an octopus mermaid lying in the center, she was using all 8 of her new arms to pleasure each one of them while using her own hand to do the same thing. <br />
<br />
She wasn’t alone, there where groups of two, three, fours and fives having sex right out in the open without much of a care in the world. <br />
<br />
The last group was what Susan and they were at the moment, they were swimming away trying to head out to sea or somewhere else. The three of them bolted past a mermaid who had become what was basically a jellyfish mermaid, her tail was stunning making it look almost like she was wearing a ball gown of some kind, but her speed was lacking as she and others were being left behind. <br />
<br />
Matt suddenly pulled up and both she and Amber followed. They surfaced near a sailing buoy, she pulled herself out of the water and turned to look back at the coastline. They followed suit sitting on the buoy, the three of them wondering what they were supposed to do. They could still sea the coast and make out the buildings but far enough away that it was unlikely that any human could get to them with ease.<br />
<br />
“What do we do?” inquired Matt as they began to process what to do.</p>
