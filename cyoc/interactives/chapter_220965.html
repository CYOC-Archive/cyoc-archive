<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The summer progressed fine, and Horizon continued to generally enjoy various elements that came the events that related to many of the things that came with summer. Generally, Horizon saw some measure of people coming in to become Animalians throughout the year, though most during the fall to spring months tended to be those that either needed the conversion to cure some disease or heal an old injury... or in some cases, those who were older and wanted a new shot at their youth, learning that a double dose would return them to their prime. The summer, with school out and more people taking vacation time, often for other events, like the IAC in Lyre/Animalia and the various other Animalian colonies or the international furry convention held in Las Vegas drew more people in and saw an uptick in Horizon&#39;s business.<br />
<br />
Though some of these things came with their own stresses and kept Horizon&#39;s workers busy. Some of it was often considered rewarding given that they were able to satisfy customers, but that didn&#39;t always mean that the stresses from the work weren&#39;t there. It also didn&#39;t mean that when Horizon could return to a more standard operation that those working there weren&#39;t relieved for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully these conversion orgies don&#39;t end up being too common,&quot; Judy commented as she looked over some of the reports from the custodial staff that was responsible for cleaning up after conversions.<br />
<br />
The reports were pretty standard and fit in with what happened with a lot of conversions. The process itself could become arousing, often because the person knew what they would gain and really wanted it or because that person was either converting to join a lover that was already an Animalian or when a romantic couple (often married) decided to become Animalians together. This often included some form of sexual action being part of the conversion from Human to Animalian, and obviously required cleaning after the conversion. And the conversion rooms were often made to make that easier, with a tiled floor and a bed that really only had the fitted sheet on it.<br />
<br />
However, some of the actions that came from people looking to celebrate becoming Animalians had produced some odd ways that often generated the wrong sort of attention. Things like the seven on four night and others. The conversions weren&#39;t necessarily illegal, but often came in an odd way and the biggest problem was often side damage that came as an additional consequence of it. Things like other floors being flooded by water or beds breaking because they were built to hold at most two adult Humans and not multiple adult large Animalians. It was something that often lead to measures being taken to make sure that conversions were largely handled within Horizon and not outside it, unless there were very specific circumstances, such as one of the partners already being an Animalian and the conversion being something that was truly a romantic one. But this didn&#39;t stop people from wanting to duplicate the &quot;seven on four&quot; night, and in the wake of &quot;Fur Fest 2023,&quot; Horizon got a lot of those requests in Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
The conversions were held at Horizon, as per protocol, but it also brought about some minor alterations, such as renovating one of the larger lab/conversion rooms that were often used for uplifting either large animals or ones that could not be easily handled to house multiple beds. It would give room for multiple conversions at once and would be secure enough for the mating that would come along with it. It would last so long as this request to duplicate the &quot;seven on four night&quot; was what drew the request and now what Judy and Doctor Stein were reviewing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think they will,&quot; Doctor Stein commented, &quot;I think much of what we got with what came out of Fur Fest 2023 has come more because the convention in Las Vegas was an international event, not a local US one, and thus having more furries that were interested in, while most of those in the US have already become Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded and thought back on the work that would go into it...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to do this with milk over injections,&quot; Doctor Stein commented as he looked over the request forms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of how many are wanting to convert at once?&quot; Judy summarized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein nodded, &quot;and it will mean the biggest part of our work would be getting volunteers to provide the milk for the conversions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded. Normally conversions were handled with injections that could deliver both the Animalia Virus and attached animal DNA in a very workable project and would be the most contained way of doing it. It was a method that would prevent accidents and was something that could be better contained long term. While unvaccinated milk from an Animalian female could provide for the same effect, it was also harder to preserve and in situations like this could present the potential for an accident. The one thing that really worked in Horizon&#39;s favor was that they had plenty of material for it and Animalians generally tended to be pretty generous.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are the list of species for this party?&quot; Judy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One bull... breed undetermined, one horse... breed undetermined, one lion, one African Elephant, one Saltwater Crocodile, one dog... breed undetermined, and one Black Rhinoceros,&quot; Doctor Stein went off the list that came in with the initial forms, &quot;with the undetermined breeds, I would assume we can work with what is available.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded, &quot;though... I&#39;m not sure on the Black Rhinoceros... I think all the Rhinoceros Animalians we have right now are White Rhinos, and one of the two females is pregnant and thus can&#39;t have the Animalia Virus in her &quot;de-vaccinated,&quot; and the other is busy with the IAC related events.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have the vials for that species,&quot; Doctor Stein commented, &quot;if absolutely necessary... we can give that one person the two shots and leave before the group gets started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded, &quot;then I&#39;ll get started with the calls to see who would volunteer.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Getting the volunteers to provide the milk was fairly easy. There were some phone calls that were made easily and checking in with those that either worked at Horizon Light or often worked fairly closely with Horizon, and that was all things that Judy knew to be fairly standard. The milk was collected and placed in thermoses that would then be kept in a refrigerator to be kept cool, after that there was a simple wait for those that had been attending Fur Fest 2023 to come up from Las Vegas to Lyre for the conversion... and Judy could remember that fairly well...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t use one of the standard rooms?&quot; a young woman with a British accent asked as she led a group of seven people, three male and four female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those rooms are too small for your group,&quot; Judy answered calmly, &quot;particularly since you want to convert together in something of an orgy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the fun stuff,&quot; one of the men smiled.<br />
<br />
Judy rolled her eyes at that, and merely lead them along. They followed along quietly until they came up to the lab room that had been temporarily converted into a conversion room for this group. It was set up to be comfortable and had things set up for even larger Animalians, which many of the base beds in Lyre/Animalia were set up for. Judy then moved to explain things.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the refrigerator on the right, you will find the thermoses for most of you,&quot; Judy spoke, &quot;each will have your name on a tag on each thermos. Be sure to make sure you&#39;ve had the RIGHT one. Leslie Lyon, I&#39;m going to have to give you two shots, as we did not have any Black Rhinoceros Animalians available to give you their milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the women then nodded and stood before Judy while the others began wandering over toward the refrigerator in the room. Judy gave Leslie the traditional, &quot;welcome to Animalia&quot; line and was then quick to depart the room, pulling the door shut tight and letting it latch. She was pretty sure that the seven of them were getting other things ready as they started to transform and for what would come shortly after, or potentially even while they were transforming. Judy finished it by pressing a button to turn on an intercom, just to make sure things were understood.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be a button by the door that you can press when you&#39;re done,&quot; Judy spoke into the intercom, &quot;It&#39;ll let you talk to anyone outside and we can then fetch you clothing you&#39;ll need to fit your new forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an answer, as Judy kept her finger pressing on the button, but it turned out to be a fairly sexual moan. It indicated that the group was already getting started and the Rabbit Animalian decided it best to let them have their fun in &quot;private&quot; and go about what work she could do while waiting for them to finish.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I hope you&#39;re right on you&#39;re prediction,&quot; Judy than spoke, &quot;as the seven of them were polite and all... but I also get the sense that they took a lot of things to the point where I think they were even looking for me to join them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly thinking that Animalians would all want to join in,&quot; Doctor Stein commented, &quot;but I don&#39;t think THAT is the issue the custodial crew is concerned over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... that&#39;s more on the question on how often they may need to be running the washing machines and so on,&quot; Judy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the moment, it would seem that we&#39;ve gotten through the worst of it for now,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;as with Fur Fest now over and more guests and visitors following the IAC, trying to replicate a conversion orgy again isn&#39;t likely... If it is requested, the group would have to still file the paperwork that would go through what this last group did, and that will in turn grant us time to be plan and be ready for it.&quot;</p>
