<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Few know, but Fusion, the merger of two formally independent beings into one entity, tends to rock the cosmic order more than most other forms of transformations. To the eternal tapestry of fate it matters little if a thread that began as human continues its journey as a dog or minotaur or a teapot. But the forceful intertwining of two separate threads into a single one? That is a whole different matter. <br />
Large quantities of energy are released when the flesh, minds, memories, thoughts and even souls of the participants are pooled and shaped into a new, coherent whole. Large quantities of energy that flare through the cosmos like white hot flames. Visible and detectable only to those who have the right eyes to see and the right minds to comprehend at close range, these flames soar into reaches as of yet unknown and there, in those uncharted parts of creation this energy might be bundled into a new star, or a new galaxy, or perhaps even lights the fuse for the creation of a new universe, though those results are rare indeed. <br />
<br />
Whatever was fuelled by the fusion of Richard and Jeff, to the two boys it was still an incredible and elating experience as they tasted the feeling of ultimate unity before being subsumed into the new being they became. Few people ever get the opportunity to remove the shackle that is individual existence, to step outside the isolating prison of the self, but at that day, in that cabin in the mountains that gift was granted to two friends. <br />
The act of it happening alone was breath-taking; Jeff felt like lying in Richard’s arms, only much, much closer, he felt Richard all around him, filling him and at the same time he felt himself surrounding Richard and filling his friend’s body to the brim, absolute unity, absolute intimacy. <br />
Richard felt his and Jeff’s mind connect, he could see his friend’s thoughts and feel his emotions, and knew that Jeff could see his thoughts and feel his emotions, they saw through each other, into each other and into every hidden depth and crevice of each other’s minds and understood every thought and every feeling as their own, ultimate acceptance, ultimate understanding. <br />
And finally came the point where Jeff and Richard ceased to be Jeff and Richard and dissolved into a single new identity, as of yet meaningless. <br />
<br />
The physical side of things was of no lesser beauty as flesh melted into flesh like clay, soft, primordial, without resistance. Surrounded by light two arms flailed together to form a single one. Two chests started to breath in unison before melting into each other two heads combined and two penises, erect from the ecstasy of the moment squished together and stood as one. <br />
The resulting body summed up and combined the qualities the pair of friends had possessed; Richard’s toned muscles were added to Jeff’s taller, more elegant stature, both enhanced as Jeff’s muscle mass enlarged the fused muscles even more and Richard added a few inches to their combined height.  This combined form might have been 6’6’’, broad shouldered, lean and muscled. A Greek sculpture come to life. <br />
<br />
The moment came when this composite man opened his eyes for the first time, as his mind sprung to life and started to comprehend his singular and unusual situation. <br />
The first moments of his existence were lost to confusion as every aspect of his surroundings, from the perspective to the way his body felt were unfamiliar to parts of his mind. Richard had been colour-blind, so there were hues in the composite man’s surroundings, like the redness of a nearby can of coke or the vivid green of the pines outside the window that to him seemed at the same time strange and spectacular as well as mundane. He was used and not used to how tall he was, he found nothing different about his body, and at the same time was unaccustomed to how strong and heavy it felt. <br />
<br />
His body-! <br />
<br />
The composite man looked down at himself…at his large and manly hands…his muscled arms…his well-shaped pecs and sixpack and that large erect cock of his. A smile appeared on his face as he started to explore his body that was at the same time so familiar and foreign. He flexed his arm and felt his own, rock-hard biceps. He traces his abs with his fingers and then went lower to…he let out a moan, his first sound in his current state and was startled at his own voice. <br />
<br />
It was then that the composite man’s mind, for the first time, realized that he was not Jeff and Richard anymore, but both of them and himself at the same time. <br />
His first reflex was to address Jeff with a “Woah dude, I’m huge!” only to find nobody answer and to experience the strange sensation of being addressed by himself. <br />
More reflexes followed; “Richard! You’re me! And…I’m you. We’re…we’re….me?”  <br />
The man’s eyes widened “We’re one guy now…I-I’m one guy now….” He put a hand on his forehead “I’m Jeff…and I’m Richard…” he mumbled to himself and with some uncertainty he added “and I’m me…”<br />
<br />
He started to wonder how this could happen, after all people are not supposed to just smash together and fuse into larger guys. He noticed the weathered leather cuffs on his wrists…the only article of Jeff’s and Richard’s clothing that had survived the fusion. He furrowed his brow…those wrists…could they…could they have been the reason for the merger? <br />
It had started when he…when they…when Richard and Jeff had put them on…and he remembered the words the shopkeeper had said to him….to Richard and Jeff… how those cuffs would make his…their stay at the cabin ‘special’. May be those things were enchanted or something? A spell that fused the wearers? <br />
He shook his head…no…fucking leather cuffs did not just fuse people together…that was nonsense! Well…he admitted…about as much nonsense as people fusing into one was in general.<br />
He looked at them for a bit…maybe...maybe taking off those cuffs would undo the spell (if that was what it was) and split him into Jeff and Richard again? <br />
He tugged at one of them about to take it off, but a cold shiver ran down his spine as he was just about to do so. He realized he did not like the idea of “splitting up” of becoming Jeff and Richard again….the idea of not being him anymore….<br />
But wasn’t that who he was; Richard and Jeff? They had just fused into him. That was who he really was, those two guys. <br />
But if that was so…why did the thought of returning to his true shape as the two boys scare him? Was it just that he liked being tall and muscled at the same time?<br />
He shook his head…no… he liked that…but he also liked being himself…he enjoyed his existence…HIS existence, not Jeff’s or Richard’s…his own, created from theirs but different and independent from theirs. <br />
Realization came; he wasn’t just Richard and Jeff smushed together…he was his own man, his own being and splitting into them would end that state.<br />
<br />
Something dark and scary sprung up in the back of his mind when he tried to imagine that, so the man quickly tried to distract himself from that scenario. <br />
Resolving to find a mirror to take a good look at himself the composite man stood up. He felt a rush of dizziness as part of him was unaccustomed to his height and had to steady himself at a nearby wall. <br />
After regaining his balance, he moved towards the cabin’s master bedroom to look into the floor length mirror there. <br />
<br />
It was the second time he found himself lapsing into one of his former personae to address the other. “Richard! Look at me.” And quickly shook his head….he wasn’t Jeff…and Richard could not answer…Richard was part of him!<br />
The reflection that stared back at the composite man was a stranger to all parts of him; in the mirror he saw a tall, broad shouldered, well-muscled guy, hot as hell and handsome as fuck. He had Jeff’s curly hair, but Richard had supplied a dash of auburn to the dull brown. Richard had also supplied the cleft in his chin, but the elegant nose and blue eyes were Jeff’s. Man he looked good! <br />
What was odd however was that he did not look like a boy of fifteen anymore, or sound like one for that matter… No he looked too masculine for that, too mature…<br />
There was stubble on his face, even covering his, now very developed, Adam’s apple. There was also a tuft of hair on his chest, along with a trail of hair running from his navel to his pubes. Further up he could see that his hairline had receded just a tiny bit along his temples. <br />
He was not fifteen anymore, he was an adult! It was difficult to tell how old he was… young still, in any case… could the spell just have added up Jeff’s and Richard’s ages, turning him 30? <br />
Well, the exact age didn’t matter, the composite man decided with a grin, the important part was he was an adult, allowed to do all the things Jeff and Richard had been deemed too young to do. Oh man, this was going to be sweet! <br />
<br />
“Well,” the composite man said to himself as he glanced down at his still raging boner, “only one thing left to take care of…”</p>
