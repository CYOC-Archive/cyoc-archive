<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You've really done it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot; replied James, with a bit of a cocky grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every single husky in the park is out there looking for you,&quot; replied Max, a wolverine who enjoyed his brand of scare tactics as well, but <br />
exercised much more restraint. &quot;You didn't finally snap and kill someone did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, you know me better than that! I might have gone a bit far with that little bunny girl earlier today though. Suppose they'll go easy on <br />
me if I turn myself in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they'll lock you in a room and interrogate you for a week before slapping you with a lifetime ban. Just don't go fingering your friends <br />
when it happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please. Absolutely nothing I have done is in violation of any of the park's rules. They'll bark at me, try and pin some trumped up charge, <br />
but there is no case to be had. Just you watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jack headed off, mentally rehearsing his defense.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Terry was in a complete state of shock. For hours, she just sat in the tunnels, huddled in the fetal position, shivering and rocking in place. Now <br />
and then one of the other rabbits would sit down next to her, sometimes bringing food, sometimes just gently stroking her arm and whispering <br />
soothing sounds, awkwardly leaving when she didn't respond. She could still see that horrible face when she closed her eyes, feel his breath on <br />
her neck. She truly felt he was going to just pin her to the ground and rip her to pieces with those teeth... maybe even indulge another sort of <br />
hunger first... she shuddered at the thought so strongly a passing rabbit immediately rushed over for another attempt at soothing her back to <br />
lucidity.<br />
<br />
Worse than the horror of the situation... on some dim distant level she was starting to recognize the wolf thought of it as some sick game after <br />
all, was how she reacted. Terry had never been one to panic like this. She thought back to all those times she'd confronted slimeballs twice her <br />
size about unfair business practices, never flinching when one snapped and through a punch. She'd hop fences with signs about trespassers <br />
being shot, trying to expose secret dumping grounds or signs of abused pets... how could she just... blank out like that? Not a thought in her <br />
head but to run and never stop. She'd understood that she'd be subject to this sort of overwhelming instinct, again, it was what she was here to <br />
prove. Somehow though, she'd thought it would be more gradual. Slowly alien thoughts would creep into her brain, and she'd fight them off <br />
through sheer stubbornness for a few weeks before her spirit broke, but no... this was all just hardwired in on day one wasn't it.<br />
<br />
She shivered again. Why did she feel so cold when she was covered in fur anyway? This other rabbit was trying to pull her into a hug now. Just a <br />
further bit of humiliation to throw on the pile... of course, she was cold, and after today she wasn't sure she had any dignity left to lose. <br />
Without really realizing it, she found herself leaning over a big, huddled against this stranger for warmth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Finally starting to come around are you?&quot; he asked in a friendly tone, wrapping an arm around her and squeezing her elbow. Terry gave <br />
the slightest of nods. &quot;I heard what happened out there. You know they're going to boot that freak out of here before the end of the day. That <br />
is not the sort of person you normally find in this place. I'm Tim by the way. Not sure anyone caught yours on the way in though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry should have felt even more uncomfortable with all this physical contact. She'd never been the hugging sort, and her temporary sex <br />
change cast a bad light on the whole scene. Still, the hug was strangely comforting. Just more of those rabbit instincts. Eventually she found <br />
the nerve to murmur a joke. &quot;So you're no ordinary rabbit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim chuckled at the reference, and pulled her up onto his lap to wrap both arms around her. &quot;Sharp pointy teeth!&quot; He grinned. &quot;Sounds like <br />
you're going to be OK.&quot; She nodded, finally letting herself relax, if only a little.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Harry glowered at James, personally interrogating him. &quot;Wipe that smile off your face! When they found that poor girl she looked like her heart <br />
was about to explode out of her chest from fear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So she's OK then? I was a bit worried there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh spare me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said when I came in, I didn't do a thing to her. You know how those rabbits get. Slightest little noise can set'em off. I just stepped on a <br />
twig while walking up to say hello, and off she ran!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what you're going to run with, is it? OK, we can play it like that. How do you explain how your scent was on her then? How do you <br />
explain the blood!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool it with the drama, you're talking like it was hers.&quot; Harry growled. &quot;I had just finished a meal, and was on my way to was up after. The fact <br />
that there was still a bit of blood on me is probably why she was so quick to run. Sloppy of me, but we don't exactly have napkins lying around <br />
do we? So she ran, I followed. I saw her trip, and went to help her up. My hand was a mess, some got on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right, you're just a misunderstood saint aren't you. So why then, did you just leave her hyperventilating in a ditch for my pack mates to <br />
find?&quot; Subordinates now, Harry mentally corrected himself. Keeps it more professional.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I have a functioning brain. Clearly, she was scared half to death of me, and it wasn't sinking in that I was there to help. When I realized <br />
that, I backed away, to show I wasn't a threat. Ever find an abandoned puppy? You don't just go right in and pick them up. You put some food <br />
on the ground, and you give them some space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I've heard, I'd think you'd just kick them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now. I'm sure you've heard all sorts of nasty things from people who can't take a joke, but have I ever been accused of violence? I am just <br />
here on vacation. Now and then I'll joke around with someone to break the ice. A little prank here, jumping out of a bush there. You're talking <br />
like I'm some sociopath, when I'm practically just out playing tag!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry sighed. This one was a slick little bastard, and he wasn't really used to this aspect of the job. He needed to take a different approach.</p>
