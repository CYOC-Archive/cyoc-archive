<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the moments of Miranda's crying and Jennifer's consoling of her, Jamie was thinking of the way Jennifer had worded her curse.  To be honest, she didn't think Jennifer could say something that long without screwing it up or leaving something out.  She had certainly not missaid anything, but there was something very important left out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenn,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;you didn't say anything about her having four breasts being normal.&quot;  Jennifer relaxed her grip on Miranda's head, gave Jamie another cold look, and said, &quot;So?  What's the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie was amazed at her lack of realization.  &quot;Jenn, everyone is going to think that her being nude is fine.  They sure as hell won't think her having four tits is OK!  Everyone will think she's a freak!  You can bet that will lead to something bad happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer's eyes widened when she realized that Jamie was right.  She tried to remain calm, as she didn't need her slave crying all over her.  &quot;OK, we can fix that with another curse, right?&quot;  Jamie answered, &quot;Yea, but we'll need her to give it back to you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer lifted Miranda's head up so that she would look at her.  Jennifer told her, &quot;OK, look.  You have to say the line back to me.  I'll pick Dare and you'll Dare me to ask you the line again.  Understand?&quot;  Miranda said, &quot;What line?&quot;  &quot;The curse, you idiot,&quot; Jennifer snapped.  &quot;T or D, got it?&quot;  Miranda's face lit up.  &quot;Oh, right.  Sorry, Jenn.&quot;  Jennifer snapped at her again.  &quot;Don't be sorry, just do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda did as she was told.  Now the curse was back to Jennifer who had this little, well, actually large and extra, problem to fix.  &quot;Miranda, you have to say Transform.  But we're not changing you again.  We're changing people's perceptions of you and your new look.&quot;  Miranda nodded her head in agreement.  Jennifer asked the line and Miranda said, &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer added to the curse she had spoken minutes before.  &quot;Miranda you will transform to have four, EE sized, addictive milk filled tits that will not be full right now so that you don't have to be 'milked' again and you will transform so that no one other than the six of us here will think that this is not your natural form and therefore everyone but the six of us will not treat you like a freak of any kind with the exception of the teasing you will still suffer as I dared earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda felt another sensation overcome her.  She looked at her breasts, all four of them, and did not see any changes.  This was good.  She didn't think she could take another alteration right now.  She did feel most of the feeling in her enhanced breasts fade away.  This gave her some comfort, as she knew it would be a little while before they would come back.<br />
<br />
Jennifer said, &quot;Well it's a good thing I come up with these quick fixes.  Yep, just call me the Quicker Fixer Upper.&quot;  Liz rolled her eyes at her attempt to sound like a paper towel ad, while Jamie groaned.  Jennifer heard this and asked her, &quot;Now what's your problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Two days ago, Jamie would not have dared do what she was about to say.  But thanks to her curse of yesterday, she knew that Jennifer couldn't get mad at her.  She replied, &quot;Oh, nothing, Jenn, except that you're taking credit for things I've done.  Why don't you just stop believing your own bullshit for a second?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer's subconscious immediately told her to slap Jamie back down where she belonged.  But that thought never crossed her mind.  &quot;Oh, fine,&quot; she said, Jamie's curse still working beautifully.  &quot;Anybody know what time it is?&quot; she asked.  Kylie ran over to wear her clothes were laying and read the time off her watch.  &quot;4:30 on the button.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go home already, then.  You two have to go admit your lesbians now anyway.  Good luck with all that,&quot; Jennifer stated.  In her mind, Jamie's parents would freak.  They were not two people who would take lightly to their daughter fucking a girl.  Jamie just shrugged and said, &quot;I think we'll be fine, Miss Fixer-Upper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish and Liz laughed at Jamie's putdown as they redressed themselves.  Miranda felt oddly out of place as she watched the others putting their clothes back on.  She knew that all of hers had been dumped in the trash, but she did not feel any reason for digging them out and putting them on her body.  In that moment she realized that the curse was working just as Jennifer had said it would.  She truly was nothing more than a slave to Jennifer, totally and completely.  <br />
<br />
The girls finished dressing themselves.  Again, Trish had a look of disappointment on her face as she replaced her clothes.  She was about to say something about it until Jamie saw and said something first.  &quot;Hey Jenn?&quot; she asked, &quot;What do you intend on doing with your new slave today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer's interest was perked, as was Trish's.  &quot;Well, since you asked, the parents are still out of town.  I've got the house to myself since the maid is always gone by now.  Something tells me I'll be doing a little of everything, just to make sure things will run smooth.  I'm gonna enjoy this,&quot; she smirked.  This was the Jennifer everyone knew.  Snobby, deceitful, more than willing to take advantage of others.  Jamie felt sorry for Miranda.  So did the rest of the girls to some extent, though none would admit it.  <br />
<br />
Jamie felt that she and Kylie had some important talking to do.  It might be time for them to think about how much time they spent with this group.  Liz also had similar feelings.  She just wanted to resume her normal life and see Dylan whenever possible.  Trish was still confused.  They had done so many things over the last two days, that she was now questioning her own sexual preferences.  She saw how happy Kylie and Jamie appeared to be.  She wondered if she could find that happiness with anyone else, of either sex.  Was it time for a change?</p>
