<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From her position in the back of the gorilla habitat at the zoo, Claire saw Tony and his little brother at the spectator overlook and her gorilla heart beat faster.  <br />
<br />
Tony!  She tried to call out his name in reply when she heard him call out hers, but could only make her gorilla shrieks and grunts.  She simultaneously wanted him to be there instantly to somehow save her from this horrible nightmare and desperately wished he would see her like that, as a gorilla.  She looked down at her body where she was crouched and felt a wave of shame wash over her looking at her huge, hairy body.  How could such a thing happen?  How could he care for me like this?<br />
<br />
A couple of the larger males were approaching yet again, wanting to mate with her.  She screeched at them as she had every other time.  They didn't advance any further but neither did they retreat.  Oh god.  The idea of being fucked by those two hairy beasts made Claire shudder.  She looked plaintively back toward Tony and Mark.<br />
<br />
And then she saw Tony strip off his clothes and climb over the top of the fencing at the spectator overlook.  Claire grunted toward his smooth skinned body, a male model with the buns of a ballet dancer and a swimmer's shoulders.  Gorgeous, but only 167 pounds.  She glanced again at the two gorillas still eyeing her.  They'd tear him apart.  No!  Don't come in here, Tony!  She shouted at him but only filled the air with grunts.<br />
<br />
Then, as she watched him hanging there naked on the gorilla side of the spectators' fence saying something to his brother, Tony's ballet dancer buns covered over in just a second with thick black hair.  Then the rest of his body became completely covered as well.  As he turned halfway toward her, she could see his penis narrow and shorten.  His hands and feet grew larger and blackened.  Tony's head changed and his nose flattened.  Now, his body widened and bulked up tremendously and his washboard abs billowed outward.<br />
<br />
Clair gasped.  He's-he's turned into a gorilla, too!  Oh no!<br />
<br />
As she watched, Tony the gorilla climbed down the rock face of the overlook to the gorilla habitat.  He approached one of the larger males by the shallow pool where he was eating ants and Claire saw that Tony was a much larger gorilla than that male or probably any of the others in the zoo.  The other male got out of Tony's way as he scurried along on his knuckles and feet.  She'd heard the keepers talk about the biggest one and say that he weighed 550 pounds.  If that was so, then Tony must now weigh 650 pounds or more, maybe 700.  <br />
<br />
She saw Tony following the arc of the path from the pool up to where she was crouched.  All the other gorillas had inspired nothing but loathing in her.  But looking at Tony the gorilla, Claire felt something completely different.  What a fine coat Tony has!  What an impressive large head!  He moves so beautifully on his knuckles like that!  There's a worthy alpha male!<br />
<br />
But the reigning alpha male wasn't about to give up easily.  Tony approached the high point of the gorilla habitat and the largest male gorilla started grunting at Tony from his spot at the back of the open area there.  <br />
<br />
Tony found he could understand every grunt and gesture of this gorilla.  Who are you to walk into my troop's territory?  Who the fuck are you?  And then there was a challenge to fight.  The alpha male slapped his chest and grunted his loudest and advanced toward Tony.  Tony slapped his own chest and grunted deeper and louder.  Bring it on!<br />
<br />
The alpha male sort of slapped at Tony and tried to bite him as he charged forward.  With great effort, Tony curled his gorilla hand up into a fist and swung a roundhouse right at his charging brethren.  He landed his punch on the alpha male's jaw, dazing him.  He curled up his other fist and advanced on the stumbling alpha male and rained a series of imprecise punches on him.  Stunned and hurt, the alpha made one last charge at Tony who lifted him off the ground and threw him down.  The moaning alpha male remained there, unable to get up.  Tony screeched with all the power of his gorilla lungs at his opponent and then beat his chest with both hands.  Long live the new king!<br />
<br />
Still gasping for breath, Tony looked around the circle at the other gorillas, proud at having won but stunned by the fact that his actions seemed to be more gorilla dictated than directed by his conscious human mind.  <br />
<br />
Tony made his way up from the open area where he'd fought the former alpha male to the sort of path dead end where Claire was crouched.  As he approached, the two males who'd had designs on fucking Claire jumped to the side and ran a short ways off to avoid the new alpha male, Tony.<br />
<br />
Claire!<br />
Tony saw her looking at him adoringly.  The poor girl.  She has no idea what's happened to her or why.  And she's so beautiful, so . . shiny coated with such a lovely high skull!<br />
<br />
Somewhere in Tony's mind, he realized that his human regard for Claire was somehow fusing with his new gorilla's physical appreciation for her present body but that part of Tony wasn't dominant.  There was no part of Tony that could overrule his gorilla sex drive, as Mark had reconstituted him.<br />
<br />
From the spectator's overlook, Mark was already looking at Tony's profile.  He'd had to fly through all those menus so fast.  If he'd only given me a few more seconds to type, I could've been sure of myself, Mark grumbled to himself.  He went back and checked on Tony's new profile and there, in the personality and sexuality options, he saw the problem.  On the line reading &quot;Dominant sexual personna?&quot;, the choice, a tab over, was &quot;New gorilla identity&quot;.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit, that was the default one.  If he'd just given me a few seconds more, I could have made it his human personality&quot;<br />
And then Mark noticed, next to the line reading &quot;Strength of libido 1-100&quot; that the choice, a tab over, was &quot;99&quot;.  Again, Mark cursed, he'd been setting all of Tony's new gorilla physical abilities at the 99th percentile and had just frantically typed in another 99 without thinking, to get through the menus as quickly as possible.  <br />
<br />
In the back of the gorilla habitat, Mark saw take Claire's slick black hand in his and draw her close to him.  <br />
&quot;Uh oh.  If he fucks her and gets her pregnant, she can't change back till she gives birth to her gorilla baby!&quot;</p>
