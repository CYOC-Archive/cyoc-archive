<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As her wand’s light died down, Dan looked at himself, nothing seemed to have happened, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something did. He looked back up to his sister to ask what she had done, but the words never made it out of his mouth, he felt numb, numb across his body like when your leg falls asleep only to wake up with a pins and needles feeling. It was hard to keep standing, and he knew that if he didn’t do anything he would collapse on the hardwood floor. He started stumbling towards the couch, it was the closest piece of furniture close enough for him to lay down on. Once he was on the couch, he gave Kat a pleading look, asking with his eyes “what did you do?!” Kat understood clearly if the smug grin on her face was anything to go by “You feel alright Dan, feeling lightheaded” she chuckles like what she said was funny, “or maybe your feeling heavy everywhere.” Another chuckle, what was so damn funny! “I can’t wait till you’re finished; in fact, I think I can already see the changed happening to you.” This concerned Dan, he tried to lift his head to look down at himself, but his body felt like it was made of lead, and nothing wanted to move. If Kat was serious about him changing, if Kat was seriously a witch and had cursed him, then he cannot see what she’d done and could only hope that his mom and dad got home soon to stop Kat.<br />
<br />
Kat looked down at Dan lying on the couch as Dan looked up at her, fear and panic in his eyes. She couldn’t be happier to finally have caught him alone, and on her birthday no less! Dan had been a pest for so long that, as far as she was concerned, doing away with Dan was a mercy on the world. After all he complained about school being hard, he pestered her for years, and worst of all, he seemed to offer nothing to society. Some would say that it was not her right to play judge, jury, and executioner, or even so far as to say she was playing God, the people, she thought, deserved to be crushed under her boot. Refocusing her attention back to Dan, she smiled at the progress her spell had made on Dan.<br />
<br />
Looking towards his legs she saw that they were starting to collapse in on themselves, his jeans looking like they were simply left on the couch. His shoes were no longer pointing upwards from his feet, instead they lay in two different directions, his socked feet were also flattened and hanging limply from his shoes. That was as far as the spell had progressed so far, stopping at before where his thighs and his hip met, and while it was fun to watch him flatten out in his clothes, she, nor he, would have need of them soon. With a wave of her wand and a green glow, his clothes were torn away from his body leaving him in the nude in front of his sister. If he could Dan would have covered his groin in embarrassment, but his body was still filled with lead, not to mention that seeing his clothes being torn away by invisible hands was all the proof he need that Kat was really a witch. Now that he no longer had clothes obstructing her view she watched on as his hands began to lose their defined shape. His arms had collapsed up to his elbow when she picked up his right forearm high enough for Dan to see. His eyes were locked in horror on his arm, everything above his elbow hung like the sleeve of a shirt, and as he looked on, he saw his upper arm lose shape. “Like what you see Dan, no? Well than just say so and I’ll stop it alright?”<br />
<br />
Dan wanted to scream, scream that he didn’t like this, scream that he was sorry for anything he’d done to her. While he was screaming in his head, Kat was watching his hips collapse in on itself, this was the reason she wanted his clothes gone, she didn’t want to miss out on watching her brother’s groin deflate. If this wasn’t to be Dan’s final fate, she would have used this as ammo to mock him. Instead, she would just have to savor this moment and treasure it for the rest of her life.<br />
Eventually Dan was just a head on a deflated body, and he couldn’t be more terrified, what did she plan to do to him and why did it involve this?! Kat wanted to laugh more than ever, his collapsed body looked so much like a deflated doll that she contemplated forgoing her idea and leaving him as a sentient skinsuit. But that would leave too many variables that could ruin her fun. So, when his head flattened out, she picked up his empty skin and brought it into her bedroom to begin the final step to add Dan to her wardrobe.</p>
