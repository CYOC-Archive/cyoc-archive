<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was already zoning out as Principal Matthews droned on about the school. He didn&#39;t really care about what his boss was saying. If anything he didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with it. Just get paid to teach. That&#39;s what he was there for. Not to help run the school that was the principal&#39;s job. He leaned into his computer and started to get a little horny again thinking about his huge dick. There was something about it&#39;s size alone that was turning him on.<br />
<br />
He grinned slightly thinking about what he wanted to do. &#39;I can jerk off in public and no one cares,&#39; he typed. However he was still cautious as he unzipped his pants and pulled out his dick. Even at half mast it was a sizable 8 inches and easily noticeable. None of the guys around him seemed to even notice though. Their eyes stayed front while he started stroking his dick. The 8 inches quickly grew. Just holding the huge monster in his hands was a lot. He&#39;d forgotten just how heavy it was. <br />
<br />
But first he needed something to jerk off to. Quickly he typed “Principal Matthews is a sexy 28 year old woman”<br />
<br />
Almost instantaneously, the principal shrunk a few inches as they expanded and contracted all over. Their waist and arms skimmed down, as their hips, ass, and thighs pushed out to jaw dropping proportions. With a sensual grunt that pitched upwards halfway through, two large breasts grew and popped out of *her* shirt. Soon after, the principal’s three piece suit morphed into a pant suit, which another small change on the computer switched to a tight pair of dress pants, showing the outline of a thong underneath, and a white blouse with no bra, as her breasts stayed up naturally with no back pain., and the top three buttons undone. John made a note to watch her go down the stairs later. It’s not like a bra would hide anything, as her nipples were clearly showing through the blouse. No one else in the meeting noticed anything weird going on<br />
<br />
Slowly John started to stroke himself. He could feel the pleasure riding up in his system. The more he worked at it the better it felt. He leaned more into the wall right behind him the more he did it. &quot;Why should I keep this pleasure to myself?&quot; he thought with a devilish grin. His hands went back to the computer, &#39;I have a flesh light that let&#39;s whoever i want experience sex with me. The flesh light makes it one of the best sexual experiences the target has had.&#39; <br />
<br />
A good sized flesh light appeared on the counter next to him. Still no one seemed to take notice of him or the object. He thought about Principal Matthews standing in the front of the room as he pressed the tip of his dick onto the tip of the toy. Principal Matthews let out a sudden moan. It was the first time in her speech that she’d stopped speaking for a second. She scanned the room wondering what the feeling was. As though nothing happened she went back to her speech. <br />
<br />
John&#39;s grin widened. He put his finger on the hole and ran his finger up it. Principal Williams&#39; face shifted. It was a mixture between intense satisfaction and worry. Her hands gripped the podium even tighter. She forced herself back to a standing position. John held his finger on the hole. Slowly he pushed deeper in. Principal Williams face winced as little by little John pushed in. The principal would have to be given an A for effort as she tried to keep her cool. But her grip could only tighten so much around the podium. <br />
<br />
Her body started to contract as John&#39;s finger wiggled around inside of her. The principal couldn&#39;t stand it. All her weight had fallen onto the podium as she tried to continue the speech. &quot;Feels so good,&quot; the principal moaned sensually. None of the other teacher acted as though it was out of the ordinary. They sat there watching as if the hot lady in front was just giving another boring speech.<br />
<br />
The flesh light in John&#39;s hands drifted back over his dick. He watched as his boss nearly fell over as the pressure against his large monster pushed against her fat ass. John pushed hard. He was way too big to fit in the tight hole. But he kept trying. The more he tried the more he got in. Principal Mathews&#39; body gripped the podium even tighter. Her hips started pushing back. It was like she knew the huge dick was behind her and wanted it inside her as much as John did. Inch by inch he was able to get the huge member inside her.<br />
<br />
Principal Mathews let out a sigh of relief. John had somehow forced his thick 13 inches inside of her. He heard the sexy woman gasp as he started to pull it back out. His boss&#39; face dropped again feeling the dick inside of her. It was impossible for him to concentrate as John moved it back and forth. The slow motion getting faster as John came closer to coming. The principal let out several louder moans, filling the classroom with her sexy moans. John finally burst. His come blasting the inside of the woman. The principal let out a loud shout as she had the best orgasm she’d ever had. <br />
<br />
John came down from his high. No one in there noticed that there was anything out of the ordinary. One of the teachers asked a follow up question and Principal Mathews answered it like nothing had happened. The only difference being she was slightly out of breath. She quickly ended the meeting. The teachers got up and left the classroom. John watched as Principal Mathews turned around revealing a growing wet spot on the back of her pants as well</p>
