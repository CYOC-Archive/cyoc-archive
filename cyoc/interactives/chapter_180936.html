<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was deep in thought about how he would change Gabe. In fact, his tail was swishing excited of the prospect. This caught Gabe’s eye. Gabe stared at Jake’s tail for a minute before Jake saw him staring. “What’s up with you?” Jake asked. Gabe quickly looked back at his screen. “Sorry! Just uh... you know. Curious.” Jake tilted his head in confusion. “Curious?” Than he looked back at his tail and made a realization. “You want to know what it’s like? To be part dinosaur right?” Jake asked. Babe blushed at the idea. “I know, it’s odd. But you never really talk about it. You think you can give me some insights? Like what’s it like to have a big thick tail like that?” Jake understood him. This is why he made the changes to himself. He decided to scrap changing Gabe until he returned to the dorm. If Gabe wanted the experience himself, Jake wanted him to know about the change. “You know what, once you’re done, I’ll tell you back at my dorm.” Jake smiled closing his laptop and putting it in his bag. “Really? Awesome! This’ll just be a minute!” Gabe finished his work on his laptop and the two headed back to the dorm.<br />
<br />
Jake took a step in to make sure his roommate wasn’t home. There was no sign of him. “Alright, come on in.” Jake beckoned Gabe in as he closed the door and locked it behind him. Jake set up his laptop and put in Gabe’s credentials. “Okay. So what do you want to talk about first?” Gabe asked as Jake typed in the change he wanted. He would make Gabe a dinosaur as well, but not the same kind. He thought a raptor would fit him better. Like himself, Jake would give Gabe a snout and tail with dark green scales. He portioned them to Gabe’s anatomy and was ready to change him. Jake clicked for reality alteration to stay on, but his awareness would be in tact. “You know Gabe, I’m gonna be honest, I really can’t tell you what this is like. Mostly because I was human just like you at least an hour ago.” Gabe gave him a confused expression. “Okay, whatever. I’ve known you since middle school. You’ve always been like that.” Gabe argued. “Well if you really want to know how this feels, you should experience it yourself.” Jake said before hitting enter initiating the change.<br />
<br />
“What are you on about?” Gabe said not noticing his nose bulging out a bit. It wouldn’t take long for him to feel his nose and jaws to inch out however. “Huh? What it this?” Gabe felt his nose as it started to flatten against his much bigger jawline until they were only nostrils. “Jake! What is- AH!” Gabe’s lips spread wide enough to reach his cheeks alongside his new extended jaws. His mouth opened revealing his teeth becoming razor sharp. Jake went over to comfort him. “It’s okay bud. It’ll all be worth it.” Jake said smiling though his massive jaws. Gabe wasn’t paying attention to Jake as his spine was feeling funny. “Gah- what’s going on back there?” Jake looked back to see a bulge in the back of Gabe’s pants. “Oh! Here comes the good part!” Jake said holding Gabe by the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Gabe couldn’t help but thrust out his back with every stretch of his spine. Inch by inch, his tail grew longer and thicker by the base as it lashed out the top of his pants. “Hah... that... that’s a tail... I have... a tail...” Gabe said as it reached its full length of 4 feet, swishing around. “That’s right buddy.” Jake said noticing another change. This time, his skin on his nose and tail started turning green and rough. The scales spread all the way from the tip of his snout to the end of his lips to merge with the human skin. The same thing happened with the base of his tail all the way to its pointed tip. Jake saw the change was completed and took Gabe to the couch to rest. Gabe laid on the couch panting through his new raptor snout. Gabe’s features were not as big as Jake’s, but they were more distinctly fit for a raptor rather than a T-rex. “Jake... *huff* that felt incredible...” Gabe finally said. “Yeah. I bet.” Jake said stroking Gabe’s new tail.<br />
<br />
Gabe recovered from his pleasurable experience and Jake explained what was going on. “So I literally just got my snout and tail today just like you. This thing just made it seem normal.” Gabe was a bit shocked to hear that Jake was once a normal human like him. He’d known Jake to be like that the whole time he knew him. But all the evidence (no matter how crazy it sounded) seemed to make sense considering how he was in line a dinosaur man himself. “Jake... this is crazy. Super cool, but too crazy.” Gabe said slightly concerned. “I know it’s weird to think about, but look, I like my new look and I’m pretty sure you’re ecstatic with this too. What the harm?” Gabe thought for a minute. “I guess, but won’t people think it weird that I’m now a raptor myself?” Gabe asked. “Already taken care off. You and I are fully aware of your transformation, but everyone else thinks you’ve looked like that your whole life.” Jake explained. Gabe smiled at the thought of this. He could experience a whole new way of life like this. “See? Looking at the bright side of things.” Jake rubbed Gabe’s snout.<br />
<br />
Now Jake and Gabe were the only two Dino people in the world. The real question was what would they do next?</p>
