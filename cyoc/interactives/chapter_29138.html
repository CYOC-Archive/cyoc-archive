<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer felt a strange tingling ripple all through her body. Suddenly everything in the room started to look smaller. She was growing! She looked at one of her arms, it had the same shape as it did a moment before, but it was almost the size her thighs used to be. She wasn’t just growing taller, she was growing bigger! Her skin tone started to change color, becoming darker. Her skin became thicker, tougher, and completely gray. The growing slowed down, just as her head grazed the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Will couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Jennifer looked like some kind of gray Amazon woman. Will couldn’t get over how tall and big Jennifer was, Will was about eye-level with Jennifer’s breasts now. Will quickly glanced at Jennifer’s breasts. Since they had grown with the rest of Jennifer they had the same shape and size relative to the rest of her body, but they were still huge. Each of Jennifer’s breasts was over two feet wide! Will craned her neck to see Jennifer’s face. Jennifer was as tall as the room and her shoulders were almost as wide as the doorframe leading in to it. Will had to wonder if Jennifer would be able to leave the room. She glanced at the door for a second to compare it to Jennifer. Jennifer could probably fit if she hunched over and turned sideways. Will quickly glanced back at Jennifer to finish watching the changes; it was so amazing to watch.<br />
<br />
Jennifer could feel the tingling intensify in her hands and feet. She could also feel a strange squeezing sensation in her hands. She lifted up a hand to see what was going on. Her ring and middle fingers were merging together. She watched as her fingernails merged to create one large nail on one large finger, it even kept the green fingernail polish with out any cracks in it. Her merged fingers rounded out into a normal finger shape. Her other fingers grew larger to match the merged middle finger. She flexed her new hands. They felt just like the old ones, they just had fewer fingers.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at her feet. Her toes had also merged together, so she only had 3 round toes with large nails. Then her feet started to shrink and become shorter. They weren’t getting narrower, in fact they looked like were getting wider. The sides of her feet near her ankles and her heels were also getting wider. Within moments the length and width of her feet were the same all the way around, giving her round foot-pads. The tingling sensation diminished in her hands and feet and seemed to focus on her head. She turned to her mirror to get a better look at her changes.<br />
<br />
Will could see Jennifer’s head start to round slightly. Jennifer’s nostrils flared, which caused her nose to puff up into a round ball, it reminded Will a little of a clown’s nose.<br />
The end of the nose started to elongate, forming Jennifer’s nose into a tube. At the same time Jennifer’s ears started to stretch out. Some parts of her ears were the same thickness while other parts were almost as thin as paper. Soon her ears were about 2/3rds the size of her head. Their shape was nearly round on top and tapered into an oval near the bottom, giving them the shape of the continent Africa. Her nose had finished growing out into a long tapered tube, complete with two finger-like protrusions. It was quite long, it nearly reached Jennifer’s belly button. The tube began to thicken as it started to gain muscles, within moments it looked just like an elephant’s trunk. With Jennifer’s new large size, the trunk was nearly as large as one of Will’s legs. The trunk swayed and then raised itself. It looked like Jennifer was trying to get used to her new appendage.<br />
<br />
“Can you use it? Can you pick things up with it?” asked Will.<br />
<br />
“I think so!” Jennifer said excitedly. “Let’s see if I can do this…”<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked over to her desk and bent over it. With her new size she had to bend quite a ways over to get to the desk. She stretched out her trunk and used the tips of it to grab a pencil that was lying on top of it. Jennifer picked up the pencil and stood up straight. She turned around to face Will. Her face was beaming.<br />
<br />
“Ow!” yelped Jennifer and dropped the pencil on the floor.  Jennifer rubbed her jaw; it was starting to feel sore. Jennifer bent over in front of the mirror and opened her mouth; two of her teeth were growing right out of it. A pair of Jennifer’s teeth, from behind her canines, was enlarging on both sides of her mouth. The teeth grew, curved a little bit, and tapered off at the ends giving her short tucks.<br />
<br />
Jennifer suddenly jumped like she had been goosed. She turned around to stare at Will. Will put her hands up in the air, with an expression of ‘don’t look at me, I didn’t do it’. Jennifer turned around in front of the mirror to get a better look at her rear-end. She could see her tailbone was pushing out, forming a gray tail tufted with blonde hair that matched the hair on the top of her head. The tail reached 3/4th of the way down her bottom.<br />
<br />
Will walked to Jennifer’s side looking at her new elephant friend. <br />
<br />
“Wow…You really do look like an elephant! What a neat transformation!” exclaimed Will.<br />
“Thank you,” said Jennifer. “I really like it myself.” She turned back in forth in front of the mirror checking out her new form.<br />
<br />
Will turned around and looked about the room.<br />
<br />
“Well, it looks like it is your turn to transform me.” said Will. “Due to the conditions it looks like you have 15 minutes to make whatever changes you want.”<br />
<br />
Will thought a moment about the conditions. They were pretty specific; Jennifer must have something interestingly complicated in mind. Will was surprised that she wasn’t nervous about transforming again. Then she remembered the other condition. She looked around the floor of Jennifer’s room, it was littered with clothes. She picked up a couple articles of clothing.<br />
<br />
“So,” said Will. “I need to wear your bra and panties in order to transform you, right? Otherwise I will turn into a horse and you will turn human again.” Will held the undergarments in one hand like she had picked up a dead mouse. <br />
<br />
Jennifer chuckled at her friend. Will was still a little uptight. <br />
<br />
“That’s right! Go ahead and put them on. Then, I will give you your transformation.” said Jennifer. She was kind of excited to see that her plan was working. She had to wonder if Will would really be able to put on the underwear.<br />
<br />
Will set the bra on a nearby dresser and started to slip the panties over her feet. It felt so strange to be putting on girl’s underwear. She had to admit she didn’t really like the idea of putting on someone’s dirty underwear; especially since they belonged to her friend. Will tried to shake off the thoughts and started to slip the panties up her legs.</p>
