<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unbeknownst to the girls earlier on the plane, even though they had tried to be careful, a boy a few rows back had gotten an ear-full of their conversation.  His name was Terry Cramer, and he was on a trip to Ireland, just as they were.  However, this trip of his wasn’t to see family; no, Terry was on his senior trip.  It was an awesome shot at freedom; he was in a whole different country than his family, just out and away with friends.<br />
<br />
	The boy was 18, and had been drumming for a few years.  Thought the flight was pretty entertaining at first, it was getting a little boring.  The kid had pulled out his drum sticks from his carry on bag, and was tapping away at the seat in front of him, singing softly a song he and his band mates had written.<br />
<br />
“…We’ve traveled down this road, but never quite this far…  This time we figure out exactly who we are...  Whoops!”<br />
<br />
On that last hit, Terry had missed the seat entirely, and had completely knocked an air conditioning vent cover off of its holster.  Knowing he probably shouldn’t have been messing with his sticks inside the plane in the first place, Terry quickly tucked them away inside his bag.  Luckily, nobody was sitting next to him to notice.  Terry grabbed the plate, and was about to try to fasten it into place, when something caught his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are the rest of the girls, then ?  Why aren't all of them coming? I mean, their moms are werewolves too, aren't they?&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice was coming through the vent.  Terry looked around, and noticed a group of three girls about three rows in front of him.  Had she said that… their moms were werewolves?  Stranger still was the fact that nobody was sitting anywhere near these girls… they had a full three rows of empty seats surrounding them.  Terry was usually against eavesdropping, but… he had to find out if they were being serious or not…  They couldn’t have been.  No possible way they could’ve been…  still…  Terry placed his ear up to the vent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...but I guess they had other plans for them,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they're not like me and Heather,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;All you guys are regular humans, because you were born before your moms were gifted. Me and Heather...well, we were in the womb when it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means what...that YOU guys are werewolves too?&quot; <br />
<br />
Terry practically did a double-take.  Either these girls were full-on serious, or they were really, really good actors.<br />
<br />
 &quot;No, we're not. Our moms are sure something's supposed to happen when we see the full moon...but I doubt it. Nothing's gonna happen. Hell, even if it did, it's not like we'd be different people, Rachel. You've known us most of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deny it all you want, Babe, But you can feel it inside of you as much as I can. On October 7th, you and I are gonna change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know that!  Sure..that's what they're saying, but we won't know until it happens.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The hell you don't, Heather...the hell you don't,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're damn right I'm scared, Deet. I've got family who are monsters, and FBI agents trying to kill my mom's friends. I myself am told that I will become a monster, like most everyone I've known for ANY length of time in my life, and my best friend in the WHOLE world seems to think it's the greatest thing ever! So yeah...I'm scared as all FUCK.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry sat back in his seat, pupils wide.  “Ho…Holy crap.”  Now, a little something about Terry was that he was… well, a thrill-seeker, to say the least.  He loved adventure in all its forms, and was usually up for just about anything.  It had been a good, long while since something had gotten him genuinely freaked.<br />
<br />
Terry popped his head up over the seats, standing up a bit to try and get a better view.  It was only then that he realized he recognized one of the girls as one of his neighbors.  “Holy crap…  I know that chick.  That’s Heather from down the street!”  Terry sat back down in his seat, his mind blown.  He knew this girl.  She was his friend.  She had been over at his freaking house just last week.  She was legit.  If what she was saying was true, then the adventure of a freaking lifetime had just plopped itself in his lap.  “She sounds… really scared.”<br />
<br />
Terry glanced back at his classmates. “They won’t miss me much if I tag along with the girls…  but… maybe they shouldn’t know I know… just yet.”<br />
<br />
Terry looked up as the plane began to land.  “I just… hope they’re actually okay…”  Yep.  Not only was he freaked, he was genuinely worried.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plane had landed, and unfortunately for Terry, he had momentarily lost track of the girls.  He hopped out of the plane, hoping to spot one of them from the steps.<br />
<br />
“Ah!  There we go!  One of them’s on the phone down there!”  Terry ran down the steps, and over to his friend, hoping not to lose her group again.  “HEY, HEATHER!  WHAT’S UP?!!”  Terry yelled out as he ran towards the group, hoping to get their attention.  As much as he loved adventure, at this point, Terry was hoping that this one wasn’t going to be the grand adventure he was seeking… at least for the sake of those girls…</p>
