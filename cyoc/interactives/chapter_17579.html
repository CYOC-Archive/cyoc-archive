<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack pranced instead of walking he felt such sensations of fluid movement like nothing he had even known as a boy. The walking and prancing about on all fours made the experience all the more wonderous too! <br />
<br />
It was night time and he was enjoying his increased stamina as he trotted for miles without even getting winded or tuckered out. All the parts of his body were for the first time open to the air and feeling the passing of it over his new coating of donkey hair. Even his tail was again offering him the sensuality he'd had before when a beast of burden, but this time being even larger of a donkey it felt somehow different.<br />
<br />
Running free he was also forgetting where he was planning to run off and live. Soon he was becoming disoriented and had to stop to look around not knowing east from west without the sun being in the sky. He was lost and this made him nervous, Jack wanted to enjoy being a donkey at stud and planned his bodies' shape and form well. He was even as walking and sniffing for the scent of females beginning to wish he'd planned out how to get to the mule farm.<br />
<br />
Cars at night seeing this large animal running free beeped their horns and somebody called the Police. It wasn't long before this new noise factor had Jack again feeling disoriented and with a chase by men on foot and Police cars he was feeling his first round of bestial fear.<br />
<br />
Yet he was quick of motion and far more agile than any man on foot. His stamina was still building as muscles propelled him over the ground and soon put the Police to shame.<br />
<br />
Jumping fences, bounding over and around object in the dark that men tripped over or had to slow down and simply climb over, Jack was way ahead of everybody.<br />
<br />
Then a friendly scent wafted his way and Jack made a bee line for it. He was so upset that any scent of farm like animal was as good as that of some rank jenny. Those chasing him were so far behind he was forgetting why he had runn for such a long way. His donkey instincts were from the chase now taking a firm hold over the rational mind of that human Jack used to be.<br />
<br />
A leap over one wire fence had his fetlock deep in sticky mud. Now each footstep felt the slime under each hoof and worse was the sucking sound as he lifted one hoof up to take another step forward. He sniffed the air and the scent was all around him but he saw not an animal in sight.<br />
<br />
Plodding along in the black of night across this field Jack was not so tickled about his newest experience as a donkey. The sticky mud was beginning to cling to his hoofs making them round out and be unsteady in the slippery, slimy, field. At last he stopped hearing the Policemen talking in the distance and laughing together.<br />
<br />
Jack stopped and turned an ear to listen here the men walking about the stupid animal they'd been chasing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You go out there and chase him, not me!&quot; said one man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no I'm pulling rank, you go out there but becareful not to fall down or your walking home!&quot; said another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit and I mean shit that smell!&quot; grumbled yet another man's voice in the dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;If he's out there he can run free, the field was just fertilized with liquid manure this afternoon!&quot; said the first man to his partners. This then known by them they got into a police car and zoomed away.<br />
<br />
Jack then lowered his head and sniffed at the very ground he was standing upon. It was the smell that wafted this scent into the air and he knew it to be from cows not horses.<br />
<br />
Now stamina was needed as each footstep became harder and more dnagerous. He did not wish to slip and fall making his clean donkey new body both filthy and then stink like cow shit.<br />
<br />
It was sun up before Jack made it across to the far side of the slimy field. He praised higher powers for at last feeling solid ground under his hoofs. A leap over another fence had him standing on hard ground, a driveway so it seemed to him. With every step and prancing the mud chipped off his hoofs but still clung with it's stench to the hairs above each hoof. if ever there was a time when being a donkey he wished to be back home and standing in a hot shower it was now.<br />
<br />
The gravel road led to a peak where he could look into the golden distance as father Sun went higher into the morning sky. Farms and more farms into the distance he could just barely see. His vision was locking into that of fixed focus equine sight and this made him fell again sad.<br />
<br />
Jacks thrilling world of donkey pleasures was fast falling into pieces. He was dirty, lost, and worse finding his sight limited which left him to seek things out with smell or hearing.<br />
<br />
Not even when he was that poor beast of burden did he realize this predicament. Here he stood his sight limited to a few yards before turning fuzzy and blurred. The many sounds of birds, machines, people talking, dogs barking, it all was a mumble jumble of mixed up sounds.<br />
<br />
The burbling sound to a creek and the memory of cold water suggested to Jack a way for cleaning off his filthy cow shit coated legs. As the chilly water touched his legs he sighed feeling the water cleaning away that stench. He stood there his mind engroused in the sensation of chilly water on legs and hoofs forgetting his very exposed self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey look down there at that Donkey, wow he's different!&quot; said a voice as Jack looked upward.<br />
<br />
It was a she as he could tell by the scent she wafted his way. Her voice was soft and pleasent to his ears and he sensed she was friendly. Bounding out of the creek Jack climbed the small rise to stand before the young lady there on a bridge over the creek.<br />
<br />
Standing there forgetting his nervousness Jack let the lady come close and begin to pet his hairy face. The touching made his fears all die away as this nice sounding person got him feeling his first real sensation of donkey passion.<br />
<br />
Now for people they show their feelings in words but donkey's especially Jack's show their male organ in full erection. So it was when Jack became very erect the lady saw it and laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like ladies I see, well I know a place where you can meet quite a few!&quot; she said as Jack felt she was even nicer than when they first met.<br />
<br />
Lo and behold Jack was now in luck as with a rope snugged about his neck he trotted along side the ladies' car and to a farm smelling of horses.<br />
<br />
Soon he was presented to the farm's owner and this tall thin man began to check Jack over like he was an animal. Leg bones, teeth, lips, a clear eye, he ran his hands down Jack's backbone giving him donkey sized goosepimples. A lifting of the tail made Jack turn his big head and look wondering if someone was going to mate with him?<br />
<br />
The man reached a warm soft hand down under Jack's thigh only to feel the large two donkey sized testicles which hung secure form injury behind a larger leathery sheath.<br />
<br />
The lady friend giggles as the man worked his hand up into the sheath making for Jack a new thrill of being fondled. Almost instantly the giant organ dropped out the sheath and began to stiffen making Jack have a real donkey sized thrill.<br />
<br />
A set of fingers now touched his very erect shaft making Jack turn and look downward trying to see why he felt as he did. <br />
<br />
&quot;See here this donkey is still most likely a virgin jack! I see no signs of any disease from mating as most owners never clean the penis of their donkeys as they'd do for a stallion. He's young and not got the monster sensations of donkey hormones which drives most older males to become mean and difficult to handle. Yes he's a very fine animal, and I note there isn't any tatoo on the lip so I guess he's now mine!&quot; said the farm man to the lady friend.<br />
<br />
Jack soon found himself happily stabled in a clean barn. He stood there looking around, listening, and making mental records of the place.<br />
<br />
Now time took to passing quickly as Jack let loose his human memories and slipped into the daily pleasures of being a grazing animal. The pasture was his private domain and he liked it. He was nightly put into his stall as the farmer took note that he never would make his bedding dirty. As with morning Jack would always prance out into the corral and there drop a pile and make a large puddle, only to high step over it and walk upwind his own donkey scents.<br />
<br />
The farm owner remarked to several people who came to visit and saw Jack in all his glory. He made note that for a donkey male Jack was exceptional in keeping himself clean, as if he understood human ideals of hygene.<br />
<br />
It was from Jack's odd ways that he was placed with a mare one fine warm sunny day. This was his first mating session and as things turned out Jack felt dismayed. Try after try he wanted to use hus hands to help guide that long heavy shaft into the glorious wet hole of the mare. <br />
<br />
Yet try as he did the shaft went right or left but never in, even the mare was getting dismayed. She kicked her hind legs almost nailing Jack in the chin. <br />
<br />
Jack jerked his head up and out of striking range as he pranced about his donkey cock in full sexual bloom. It slapped his thighs as he walked making him lust for the sensation of mating even more. He danced about as the two tried time and time again till it was well past dusk.<br />
<br />
A tired jack was led back to his stall. Tongue hanging out of his mouth Jack was dead tired of his first day of learning to be a good Jack donkey male. Soft sounding words came from the man as he groomed and brushed Jack's hairy donkey hide. The day's romp was so wearing on Jack that he soon folded his legs under him and tucked them tight to his sore body only to fall asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning had Jack eating an extra ration of grain and oats. A quarter bale of fresh hay, and a fine big bucket of clean clear water. Then he was amazed to see the farm owner come again and lead him out to the corral and that still very horny mare.<br />
<br />
Encouraging words from the man fell into ears of a donkey who understood english quite well. Jack did exactly as he was told making the man stand to one side and wonder how this animal understood him so well? It took this time only three jabs with his donkey shaft before the flared tip of his donkey cock pierced the lips of that mares sex.<br />
<br />
In it went as Jack brayed wildly feeling his cock now moving into the hot mare's body. Inch by inch it went in and down as she gripped it with unbelieved strength. As jack felt the feeler hairs of his bold sheath touch her quivering lips of &quot;mare in heat&quot; passion, he began to thrust in and out.<br />
<br />
Grunting out his braying sounds the young verile male donkey Jack was giving in to the instinctive passions he would long to enjoy again and again. Most donkey jacks thrust five times and then give there worth to the mare. Not jack as he was remaining high and in delight and holding the orgasm back for only to enjoy the most thrilling moment of his young life.<br />
<br />
At last he could hold it back nolonger as with a sense of rush he spewed his load once, twice, three times and then a forth. A wide eyed farmer watched as the male donkey mated with alomst human understanding of his sensual delight over the simple ways of beastly styles of procreation.<br />
<br />
Jack dismounted the tired out mare and pranced around the corral making a cloud of dust. <br />
<br />
The well mated mare was led to her stall as Jack finally calmed down and return to his rightful owner's hands. A good slap to the strong neck told even Jack he'd performed just fine. A ration of oats and he stood amazed as the man poured into the bucket a bottle of dark beer.<br />
<br />
Jack ate it quickly down thew beer and oats mash, and licked, licked and licked the bucket clean of every drip of the beer. Thrilled yet and still erect Jack stood for a grooming and then for some doctoring.<br />
<br />
As one of the man's children held Jack's rein the man put hobbles on hind feet. Jack looked back wondering but still so personally thrilled with his day he let the man do as he wished.<br />
<br />
Erect but not to the point of mating or masturbation, Jack stood there as the man took a firn hold of Jack's donkey cock. Then came an uneasy feeling as the man was probing something into the piss hole of his donkey cock. He could feel somwthing hard being plucked out and worried him, making Jack stand stiff and alert.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, got it!&quot; said the man as he stood up and walked forward to stand before Jack and the man's son.<br />
<br />
Holding up what Jack remembered was a Q-tip like his mother used on his younger ears for cleaning out ear wax, the man showed off a white pearl of hardened semen which he plucked out of Jack's cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;See this, its called a pearl and if left inside the animal's penis it would in time stop him from being a good sire. It's all part of knowing animal hunbandry, you'll study this in time when you go to college!&quot; said the man to his son as Jack was learning there too.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a day later when a big white truck pulled up by the barn and Jack was led out to meet it. Again he was hobbled by his forelegs as the men took hold of his hind foot. talking they looked his hoof over as then the man and the farm owner went into the back of his truck.<br />
<br />
Soon they returned and again the man took hold of Jack's hind leg flexing it backward and holding it between his knees. It was when the small hammer started pounding on his hoof Jack realized he was being shod with iron shoes.<br />
<br />
Just as startling the memory of what the speaker said when he was still under the emmitter's rays came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, you have just been cured from all your physical abnormalities. As a bonus to your continued good health this program assures that these changes are both as complete as this machine can make them, and what's most important, this is all permanent!&quot;<br />
<br />
The word permanent suddenly had new meaning as the Farrier drove home the nails which held the iron forged shoes to Jack's pure untaited hoofs. Now the first real feeling of having become an animal, a piece of some man's property, a beast of burden, this is what Jack had become!<br />
<br />
Shod on all four feet the added weight to his fleet footed hoofs was making him step about lifting his hoofs extra high as he walked. <br />
<br />
The men laughed of Jack's obvious reaction as it was common for animals just shod to do as Jack was then. The man drove away and then the farm owner turned jack out to pasture for a mind draining time to graze.<br />
<br />
Grazing was just that as Jack got working his lips and teeth to biting off blades of grass and munching them into a slurry for swallowing. The motion became a total engoused action which soon led Jack into a dull clouded mind that seemed to eek away at those memories of when he was a boy.<br />
<br />
Day by day the time passed and soon jack took note of the coming chill of Fall. As tress changed colours he was reminded by his equine vision or where he was and what, as he could not see in colours himself anymore.<br />
<br />
The memory of his change being permanent was just now coming to rooste. As time passed and his transmutated body settled into the species he gained or lost certain abilities. The loss of seeing in colour was maybe his worst realization. Jack's virginity had slipped away and although his parents would have been ashamed, Jack was not!<br />
<br />
Grazing was the one difference which made him realize he was an animal. The human manners of holding food in one's hands and using utensils for eating are all gone as Jack had to lower his head to the grass and lip gather the blades of grass. This was his one major downfall to being a donkey and he thought of it often. His mouth being the one thing which sampled the food, licked at soaked vulvas, and helped to itch places that needed a good scratching.<br />
<br />
Often when it rained he'd stnad over a puddle and looking down into it he got a view of his sheat, balls, and an erection. Otherwise what was back there was out of sight but firmly on him mind.</p>
