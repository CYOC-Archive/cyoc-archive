<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Como on, give me that!&quot; Ally commanded snappishly, but already snatched the coin out of his hand.<br />
&quot;Do you really think hypnosis is real? This sites you are browsing through are FAKE. I mean do you really believe that when I swing this coin in front of your eyes that you will fall into a ‘trance‘?“<br />
<br />
But she didn’t get an answer. Instead she observed how her brother’s eyes glazed over, even before she had ended her sentence.<br />
‘He was faking it. He must be faking it.’ she thought, looking deeply into his motionless open eyes. Unbelievingly she waved her hand in front of his eyes, but there was no reaction by him.<br />
While still swinging the coin on the golden chain she moved her arm closer to herself, stretched her head forth and turned it to watch the coin from her brother’s perspective.<br />
While the coin swung, the black white spiral on it was circling. She stopped the coin with her hand and with that also the circling mechanism stopped.<br />
Quickly she figured that it probably was the purpose of that little wind-up thing at the side of the coin to make the spiral able to spin. The wind-up key had just the size of a cut pinky fingernail, so just big enough for index finger and thumb to grab it.<br />
Meanwhile her brother was still mindlessly starring straight. ‘If he is just faking it, he really plays a good role.’ Ally thought, while trying to come up with an idea to prove it. But anytime she tried to come up with an idea that was so humiliating that he couldn’t fake it, it faded away like being blocked out by her own mind. ‘This is crazy!’<br />
How was she possible to find out if he is really hypnotized, and more importantly, how could she find out if he had her already hypnotized before?! It would explain why her mind behaved so weird when she thought of doing bad things to him.<br />
And then she finally got it; she smiled triumphantly, impressed by her own ingenuity. Now she had a way to find about everything with just one question. <br />
“Kyle, when you can hear me say: yes Ally.”<br />
“Yes Ally.”<br />
Her hands already shivered of excitement.<br />
“Very good. Now I want you to tell, if you have hypnotized me at any time, and what you made me do or what triggers you implanted in me.”<br />
And then Kyle begun; like a robot (sorted and monotone) listing everything obediently and without restrain.<br />
“I hypnotized you to feel bad, like when you were in third grade and bullied by Jennifer, whenever you tease me. Then I made you unable to tease me entirely.<br />
I made you wanting to mow the lawn for me, like it was your idea to make up for teasing me all the time in the past.<br />
I made you unable to remember what happens during your trance so that it would feel like fun.<br />
I gave you a trigger named ‘Good Girl’ that causes you to feel and behave like a dog a bit more whenever you hear it.<br />
I gave you a trigger named ‘Good Dog’ that causes you to instantly be a big, happy dog.<br />
I gave you a trigger named ‘Barbie Doll’ that causes you to instantly become your normal self, no longer being a dog or anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Feelings mixed inside of Ally. She was absolutely in rage about what her little bratty brother had made her do and was planning on doing. She was full of excitement to turn the tables on him. And then she was curious of why she felt so odd when he said these trigger words. It was as if she was already starting to be affected by them but then he moved on with the next one. When he said that one to instantly become a dog she felt her skin tingling and for a short moment it seemed like her arms would grow hair and her head would be molded. Fortunately it ended when he gave her the ‘Barbie Doll’ command. This was scary but also proofed the realness of the power of this coin. One other thing that nearly killed her was that she still couldn’t remember the things he told her while being in trance. It was as if there was just blank space where the information should be saved in her brain. She also knew before he told her that she mowed the lawn, but now she knew the REAL reason for it to happen. It was time for revenge; NOW! But there was something before it that needed to be done.<br />
She had to get rid of these triggers before she could start to turn his own weapons against him, but how? She shortly thought of instructing him to dehypnotize her when she waked him up and to remove all his former instructions. But the feeling of having him have all this power in his hands was scarring her off. Who said that he wouldn’t be able to use this opportunity to make her obedient to him once again? No, there must be another way. And after some thinking Ally had just found it.<br />
She took out her mobile from her shorts’ pocket and opened the recording app. She pressed on record and let it run for a few seconds, then began to speak:<br />
“When you hear that Ally, you will be in a deep trance and listen closely to the words I say and carry them out without hesitation. You will no longer have any problems with teasing your brother, instead you will enjoy it even more. All trigger-words inside your mind will disappear the moment you wake up from this trance. These words no longer will have any effect on you whatsoever. When you hear me say the number ‘two’ you will grab that coin that Kyle is swinging in front of you and at number ‘three’ you will wake up, refreshed and alert. So waking up at: one… two… three!” and with that Ally tapped on the stop symbol. She had spoken loudly and clearly but still heard through it one more time before she would give it a try.<br />
It sounded good, so Ally addressed Kyle again:<br />
“Kyle, the moment I snap my fingers you will take the coin into your hands and when I say ‘start’ you will being to swing it back and forth in front of my eyes. You will not stop by yourself or be able to move in any other way. You can’t even talk; just able to breathe, blink and swing the coin is all you are capable of until is say other. Oh, and one more thing. You will never remember that you were hypnotized by me, nor will you have any memory that you have hypnotized someone ever before. All you know about hypnosis is that you have seen it in TV sometimes, AND, that it works perfectly well on you. If you understood these instructions nod your head.”<br />
He did, what created a big smug smile in Ally’s face. Then she snapped her fingers.<br />
*snap*<br />
She handed him the chain with the coin and helped him positioning his arm in front of her. Then she looked down on her phone and pressed her finger on the play-button, in the same moment commanding Kyle with: “Start.”<br />
<br />
The next time she opened her eyes she saw her brother still mindlessly starring straight, his arm stretched out but nothing in his hand. In her own hand she found a nice coin which sight filled her with excitement. Now was the time to play a bit with her brother. And while he still seemed to be under her trance, she swung the coin in front of his eyes; giving her a feeling of power. There were now many things that popped into her mind of what to do with him, one better than the one before.</p>
