<br />
As Dean Myers left the Decrux Delights Sweet Shop, its proprietor was fuming mad!<br />
However, since owner Alice Decrux was the only one in the establishment at the moment, there was nothing she could do to &quot;claim&quot; Harold and seek revenge on the dean of Moon Lake College in the process until her after school counter help arrived for the day.<br />
So Alice sat on a stool behind the display counter and fumed while plotting her next move.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Harold Jenkins&#39; nap wasn&#39;t all that great, but whether it was because of trying to sleep on the living room sofa or the dreams he had, Harold wasn&#39;t sure and feared the answer.<br />
Once again he dreamed of his next door neighbor Virginia McCoy, who was a high school history teacher, which gave them one thing in common since he taught the subject at the college level.<br />
Harold wouldn&#39;t publicly admit that despite how attractive Virginia was, he was uneasy about her also being a were-tigress.<br />
Since moving to Moon Lake required one of the Jenkins to join were society, his only daughter Melissa was seriously considering the task herself.<br />
Harold still had uncertainties about that too.<br />
But what troubled Harold the most was that the more he thought about Virginia, the less he thought about his deceased wife Eliza.<br />
Which was partly why he took his new college supervisor up on his lunch offer, to get away from the house and hopefully his troubles too for awhile, and now found himself eating at a local establishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of an appropriate name,&quot; commented Harold, laying down the menu that indicated the local diner was named The Local Diner.<br />
&quot;Been in business for decades. Good food,&quot; replied the dean, who always responded to that word as either a title or his first name, considering he hated the one he was born with. &quot;But showing you some of the more positive aspects of life in Moon Lake wasn&#39;t my only reason for wanting to have lunch with you today,&quot; he added, as the waitress collected their menus along with their orders to be prepared.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Harold, raising an inquisitive eyebrow.<br />
&quot;Yes. I need to warn you about one of your neighbors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; asked Harold, suddenly dreading the answer.<br />
&quot;Alice Decrux.&quot;<br />
Harold didn&#39;t even realize he was holding his breath until he breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;For a moment there, I feared you were about to say something bad about Virginia McCoy.&quot;<br />
&quot;McCoy?&quot; asked the dean. &quot;No. Actually, she&#39;s a good person. Member in good standing with both my pride and the community. Why?&quot;<br />
Harold hesitated a moment, and then told the dean about his current, personal problems.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; was the dean&#39;s only comment when Harold finished. &quot;Is it because she&#39;s a were?&quot;<br />
&quot;Truthfully? I&#39;d be a bit hesitant to pursue a relationship on that alone, because I&#39;m still trying to adjust to the town over all and the fact that my daughter is about to join one of your groups, but it&#39;s more Eliza than anything else,&quot; admitted Harold as the waitress came back momentarily with their drinks.<br />
&quot;How long has it been since your wife...&quot;<br />
&quot;Almost 4 years now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. And the issue of Virginia being a were aside, how do you feel about her?&quot; wondered the dean.<br />
&quot;Honestly?&quot; said Harold, stopping to give that some serious thought. &quot;I do like her as a person,&quot; he confessed. &quot;She&#39;s smart and teaches history too, although on the high school level. Virginia&#39;s nice and a wonderful conversationalist as well as being more than pleasing to the eye,&quot; he added with a smile. &quot;Yet every time I stop and seriously consider the possibility of seeing Virginia as more than just a neighbor, I can&#39;t help thinking I&#39;m betraying Eliza somehow,&quot; before telling the dean about his dreams.<br />
<i>And I thought the Skulk&#39;s life/soulmate bond was strong,</i> observed Dean Myers, before saying, &quot;Don&#39;t you think that Eliza would want you to move on...&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; confessed Harold, shaking his head negatively. &quot;Eliza did try talking to me about this once, before the cancer claimed her, but I wouldn&#39;t let her discuss it. Until we were told it had reached Stage 4, I was confident she could beat it and we&#39;d be able to get on with our lives and put all those bad days behind us,&quot; revealed Harold, just as the waitress came with their lunch orders.<br />
&quot;And if your roles were reversed and Eliza was the surviving spouse?&quot; asked the dean.<br />
Harold Jenkins had absolutely no response to that question.<br />
<br />
They ate silently for a time, until Harold asked, &quot;So what did you want to tell me about Alice Decrux?&quot;<br />
&quot;That the were-raccoon is a user,&quot; replied Dean Myers.<br />
&quot;Drugs? Alcohol?&quot;<br />
&quot;Men,&quot; said the dean, before laying everything out for Harold, including the documentation he had in the briefcase that was sitting in the booth with him.<br />
&quot;Geez. How come nobody&#39;s done anything about this?&quot; Harold wanted to know, handing the paperwork back to the dean after reading it all for himself.<br />
&quot;Suspecting something and legally being able to prove it are two different things. Decrux has been brought up on charges before, but nothing&#39;s stuck so far.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, were or not, I had no interest in Decrux to begin with, and I&#39;m certainly not about to develop any now,&quot; replied Harold, handing the paperwork back to the dean.<br />
&quot;Good. Even if I wasn&#39;t a weretiger, part of my personality has always been to look out for those under my leadership; faculty, other employees, and students alike. I already had one incident earlier this semester affect the lives of two people I&#39;m responsible for*, so I&#39;m not about to let anyone else get hurt on my watch,&quot; growled the dean.<br />
&quot;Good to know. Thanks for the warning,&quot; said Harold. &quot;Now if I only knew what to do about Eliza and Virginia.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wish I could help, but I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re on your own there,&quot; admitted Dean Myers.<br />
<br />
When their lunch was over, the dean took a leisurely route back to Harold Jenkins&#39; house so he could show his new history professor some of Moon Lake&#39;s landmarks.<br />
It was approaching 4 by the time the dean parked his car in the Jenkins&#39; driveway.<br />
&quot;Thanks for lunch,&quot; said Harold, as he started to get out of the passenger seat. &quot;I haven&#39;t made much progress on that syllabus yet, but I will have it ready for you by Monday,&quot; he promised.<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; said the dean, sitting in his car with the engine idling. &quot;I—&quot;<br />
&quot;Harold,&quot; called out a pleasant voice, as both men turned to see Virginia McCoy getting out of her car at the house next door. &quot;I was wondering if you finished going over those text books for me? I need them back so I can comment on them at the faculty meeting tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure have. Let&#39;s go inside and I&#39;ll discuss my opinions on them with you,&quot; replied Harold, unaware that he was smiling as Virginia approached.<br />
Observing everything within his car, Dean Myers thought, <i>If Harold doesn&#39;t realize he&#39;s falling in love with McCoy, maybe I&#39;d better consider finding a new history professor.</i><br />
<br />
But just as Harold was escorting Virginia to his front door, they heard a shrill voice cry out, &quot;HAROLD JENKINS! Just what lies has that man been telling you about me?&quot; Alice Decrux demanded to know, as she started storming across the street from her house towards them.<br />
&quot;Stay away from me madam. If I ever do join your were world, I have no intention of doing so as a raccoon!&quot; Harold shouted back.<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; screamed Alice, even as she was crossing the sidewalk into his front yard. &quot;This is your doing!&quot; she screamed at Virginia. &quot;You and that meddling partner of yours!&quot; she added, pointing an accusing finger at the dean, still sitting in his car. &quot;Get away from him! Harold&#39;s mine!&quot;<br />
If anyone noticed that he now had his cellphone in hand and was calling the police, no one said anything.<br />
&quot;Look Alice. I&#39;ve put up with your shenanigans for years,&quot; said Virginia calmly, as she moved to stand in between Harold and Decrux. &quot;What Harold does or doesn&#39;t want to do is his business, but he&#39;s made it perfectly clear how he feels about you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care what you think bitch!&quot; screamed Alice, before punching Virginia in the nose.<br />
&quot;Now wait a minute!&quot; began Harold, as Virginia growled and launched herself at Alice.<br />
<br />
With that, the two women fell to the ground as they punched, kicked, screamed, and pulled each other&#39;s hair.<br />
Dean Myers was ashamed for his town as he saw a weretigress and a wereraccoon now fighting on Harold Jenkins front yard, tattered bits of what remained of their clothing strewn about in their path. Yet there was one concern on Myers&#39; mind as he started unbuckling his seat belt...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies! Stop!&quot; begged Harold, moving closer in hopes of breaking the fight up.<br />
&quot;HAROLD! GET BACK!&quot; yelled Dean Myers as he got out of his car.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Harold, turning his head to look at his friend and employer.<br />
Suddenly Harold screamed as he looked down at his leg as the two women continued to fight, totally oblivious to what just happened in the heat of the moment.<br />
Harold saw that one of his pants cuff and sock were torn as blood began to seep out of the newly created scratches.<br />
Whether he wanted to or not, Harold Jenkins was about to join were society, but as what???<br />
<br />
NOTE: Picking one of the two numbered options cancels the other for Harold, while picking one of the two Meanwhiles cancels the other one for Melissa.<br />
Personally, I&#39;m hoping for #1 for Harold, but that&#39;s up to the next author.—tmw.<br />
