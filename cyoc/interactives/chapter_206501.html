<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam stood over the wolf, his thick cock laying across the lupine&#39;s muzzle, enjoying the feeling of the rough tongue lapping at his balls. He teased one of Gio&#39;s pointed ears as that tongue ran along the bottom of his dick. Reaching up, Gio took Sam&#39;s cock in his paws, opened his mouth and..<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey..&quot; Sam felt someone shaking him gently. &quot;Wake up, big guy.&quot; He opened his eyes from the pleasant dream only to see the object of that dream hovering over his face. &quot;We need to move the furniture to finish up the floor and you&#39;re too big for the two of us to lug around.&quot; The wolf said with a grin, his eyes shifting down Sam&#39;s torso to something lower.<br />
<br />
Sam looked down and felt his ears heat up as they flicked with embarrassment. His shorts had slipped below the top of his sheath, a few good inches of his cock exposed, chubbed up from the dream he had been having. He quickly tugged up his shorts as he shifted to a sitting position, his hooves hitting the floor with a soft thunk, not that it did much good in hiding anything. Nor did pulling his tank top down over it do much to conceal anything. Why had he put on such small clothes? &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no need to apologize.&quot; Gio said with a sly grin. Sam&#39;s nostrils flared at a sudden spicy scent he was picking up from the wolf. His brain quickly put a name to the scent. Arousal. It only made Sam more self-conscious. Especially when he looked over and saw Hank working on something in the kitchen, studiously not looking their way.<br />
<br />
Sam got to his hooves, a sudden vertigo overcoming him, a feeling of being off balance taking over for a moment before catching himself. He felt paws on his arm and looked over to see Gio helping support him, gripping his arm with paws that had trouble wrapping around the thick muscle. Over and a little down. Why did that seem strange, like he felt the wolf had been the taller of the two of them? &quot;Easy there, big guy, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded, some instinct taking over as he felt his balance come back to him. &quot;Yeah, just post nap grogginess. I need to, um..&quot; He nodded towards the bathroom and headed that way. He shut the door behind him and turned on the sink, cupping his hands under the running water. He stared at his hands, his fingers looking odd, as if each of the two non-thumb digits were two small fingers stuck together, even with separate nails. But even as he stared they looked more normal by the second, two thick fingers with a single dark nail each. He shook his head. Something was wrong, maybe he was sick. Not that he had found a decent anthro doctor since moving to this town. He splashed his face with the cold water and took off his now slightly damp tank top to dry his face.<br />
<br />
He stared at himself in the mirror and still felt that slight disconnect in reality. His broad muscular chest and stomach were covered in short brown fur that was spreading across his shoulders and down his back and arms, turning to a creamy white at his elbows, the fur growing longer there as it flowed down to his hands. Just a bit longer, as he kept the fetlocks trimmed for neatness sake, much like he did the short, black brush of his tail. Last thing he needed was that getting caught in some machine at the construction site. Easier to just trim it short.<br />
<br />
More short brown fur grew up his thickening neck, where it me his stubble and filled in, jaw aching slightly as his muzzle pushed out further. His brows however bleached white, the familiar patch of snowy fur covering his forehead down across the top of his muzzle. A row of his buzzed hair between his ears grew out a bit longer into a trimmed mohawk of a mane he felt grow down to between his shoulder blades. He hated letting his mane grow out too long, keeping it short enough it naturally stood up.<br />
<br />
As his features changed he felt that panic welling up inside of him again. A voice in his brain screaming that this wasn&#39;t right. But as he stared into his own reflection he felt easy, familiar. This is who he was. He flexed and stretched a little, his muscles must have been sore from sleeping on that too small couch. Maybe he could get a bigger one. Speaking of bigger, he needed to get new shorts, these ones looked painted on, especially around where they hugged his thick sheath. All the heavy lifting at work must have put a few more pounds of muscle on him. He turned at an almost timid knocking at the door, reaching out to open it up.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Gio wiped his paws off on the side of his work pants surveying the last of the floor as it dried. &quot;That everything?&quot; He asked, tongue rolling out of his mouth as he panted a bit.<br />
<br />
Hank walked over to their crate and pulled out the checklist. &quot;Filters, drain traps, dryer, floor treatments, light fixtures with sunlamp optional bulbs not that he&#39;ll need that feature, unless he starts dating someone cold-blooded.&quot; The skunk says with a look over to Gio, who only looked away instead of meeting those eyes. &quot;Yeah, that about covers it.&quot; The wolf&#39;s eyes were fixed on the bathroom door, making Hank just let out a big sigh. &quot;You don&#39;t even know him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t want to.&quot; Gio replied a bit defensively. &quot;I still think we could bring him on the crew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to replace me as your partner?&quot; The feigned hurt in Hank&#39;s voice made Gio sigh softly and shake his head. The skunk snorted. &quot;Fine. You can offer to bring him to the boss, but don&#39;t come crying to me if it backfires. You can give him the rundown of the changes while I pack up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gio shot his partner a big smile. &quot;Thanks, man. I owe you a beer after work.&quot; He stepped over towards the bathroom, giving a light knock on the door.</p>
