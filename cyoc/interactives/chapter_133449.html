<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Sharon could run, she spotted a couple-a christian one at the fact. Walking down arms in arms, the expensive looking couple kissed each other lovingly. As she noticed and recalled who they were.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t want to show you this but I had to, your old girlfriend and Eric’s Boyfriend are gone forever.”<br />
<br />
Sharon cried as she watched Mary kiss Peter, who she assumed to be “Ric’s” former boyfriend, lovingly as their engagement rings shone in the moonlight.<br />
<br />
Eric shed a single tear down his right eye, but the growing part of Ric smirked, thank God that old faggot that was Eric’s boyfriend was gone! Who da fuck was he anyway?<br />
<br />
As Eric/Ric saw the lesbian, partly disgusted at her sobbing over an ex-dyke while at the same time feeling compassion. He walked over and placed a meaty palm over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“No prob babe! We still got each otha’!” Ric smirked as Eric gave up. He lost his old boyfriend and was so alone, he wanted to be done with it all-at least as Ric and Shari, their fates would be sealed as gym jocks foreva and even if by chance the new straight Shari would “dump” him, his new cocky self would be able to find a new babe. <br />
<br />
Though Ric , the homophobe, truly did love Shari. Despite being a player, she too was one. That’s why they both matched so well, hot, sexy and jocks.<br />
<br />
But thanks to the almost completed curse now, he was dying for some pussy. He would love to have Shari back...though being the pussyhound jock he was-he needed one, anyone, stat!<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, the moment you make intercourse a final time, I’ll make you two permanently together, unable to get far apart even if you wanted!”<br />
<br />
Sharon could not trust that voice, but for the first time she knew it was sincere. She muttered underneath sobs the following words as her boobs unwittingly became erect due to the curse.<br />
<br />
“I give up...I want to be straight with Ric foreva!” The last syllable rolled off her tongue, gaining that new yorkah accent both gym jocks now donned.<br />
<br />
“That’s ma Shari!” Ric said as he leaned and pushed them behind a bush, really cannot wait, and with the curse taking effect, Sharon-turning Shari, felt the same way.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me, Only dykes hate Dicks.”<br />
<br />
She felt so bitchy with that thought placed in her head, rolling over as she loosened her shorts-which shifted longer to slick black lycra jogging pants as her legs became dark-toned and slender like Ric’s. She moaned as she thought about Ric penetrating her womanly pussy with his large dick past her new cotton panties, as that thought became reality as Ric slid down his jogging pants and PIERCED into his girlfriend’s.<br />
<br />
“Ya like that don’cha babe?” Ric grinned a sick grin, as his very own faggy dick became expanding and increasing tremendously in girth as it explored once again, the wonders of the woman’s pussy.<br />
<br />
His black hair became spikier in its close crop cut, sweat glistening over his forehead as his lantern jaw chiseled out deeper with a chin-strapped beard instead of just stubble. His eyes blinked an envious green, always wanting to win and be the alpha of the couple like the man he is, as his body swelled with even more muscle.<br />
<br />
Sharon, being even more shocked at Ric’s improvement as her slutty but playgirl self only laughed. She know she was the queen and boys were to serve her, as her boobs to a healthy e-cup, her shirt being unzipped with a new zipper as it got tossed aside into her hoodie. Revealing her sports bra in which Ric hastily tossed aside so he could fondle it.<br />
<br />
“Course babe~ Love your big strong manly cock, only dykes hate dicks~”<br />
<br />
“Good, now repeat after me, I hate so much when lesbians look at me, my body’s for the men only~.”<br />
<br />
As soon as she heard that, she moaned greater, the tan spreading all over her bod as her long hair twisted to a pony tail. She watched through the lens of Shari’s-her gorgeous features as she spat and rolled her eyes against lesbians as well as gays who cannot appreciate her bod. With every sassy attitude, her body became more toned and sexy every moment, so much so that Ric took off his own underarmor shirt and slid on his jock sunglasses cause he could not withstand the sexiness in front of him.<br />
<br />
I mean he could-but he loved teasing and playing his babe. Plus she loved his playfulness, he was a man after all!<br />
<br />
Shari pouted as she felt her facial features taking on the hold of a beauty models, in which both She and her boyfriend both did aside from being main trainers in the gym. Bodybuilders and jocks in their own respective genders, as her hair shifted to blonde and her eyes blinked a light blue. As she winked at Ric, feeling the incredible attraction she had towards him as the old Sharon spouted out the words in ease.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, I hate it when like, lesbos creep up on me! Gosh Oh my god!” Her mouth opened wide, licking the saltiness mixed with her strawberry lipstick. She loved giving Ric her famous blow job. “My body’s for real men only~!”<br />
<br />
With that statement, she pretty much forgotten about Mary or like...who? All she needs is a big strong man like Ric, as he fondled her tits, as she felt the strong presence over him.<br />
<br />
“Repeat after me, the both of you. I love being a straight homophobe and this is my sexy partner.”<br />
<br />
The two of them already lost their old gay selves, as Ric nodded alongside Shari. There was no reason not to say that considering that statement was true-plus they wanted to finish their night jog already, it was getting late.<br />
<br />
“I love being a straight homophobe and this is my sexy partner.” The two of them said the exact words in their respective sentences, as Ric bellowed a loud “ROAR!” As he thrusted to the deepest parts of Shari and BLEW! With Shari herself letting loose as her pussy dripped after drip.<br />
<br />
“C’mon babe, lets do it again back at home, don’cha wanna get the prize?”<br />
<br />
“Sure baby, just try and stop me~!”<br />
<br />
Shari kissed her boyfriend back lovingly. Glad she had such a strong man to take care of.</p>
