<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Frieda helped her grandparents clean up the dining room table; everyone could here Amanda futilely try and argue with her husband Benton. Trying her best to win the argument, despite the fact it’s becoming clear that she was on the verge of starting a fight; a fight that Benton had no intention of letting happen. Everyone except for Benton and Amanda where now in the front foyer; with Lance and Lila shifting and re-dressing so they could look normal in the few remaining minutes of daylight before the sunset ends. Anton and Esmeralda choose to remain in their were-panther fursonas; having rented a car large enough for them to drive while furry and equipped with tinted windows; the four are escorted out by Frieda and they quickly leave.<br />
<br />
Frieda watching them get into their cars and drive off; she turns around to see Eric and Spencer waiting for her. “Give me a few moments,” Frieda speaking; “I need to have a few words with mother.”<br />
Frieda quickly walks towards her father’s study and instead of knocking, she chooses just to enter.<br />
“Well I hope your happy mother,” Frieda looking at the two arguing were-panther; “you ruined a family dinner with your snobbish nature.”<br />
“Get out,” Amanda snarls.<br />
“Don&#39;t you snarl at Frieda,” Benton responding; “our daughter is right; “you have no one to blame for the dinner disaster but yourself.”<br />
“Like hell,” Amanda refusing to back down; “I can blame your father for preparing that stew.”<br />
“That doesn’t explain you calling Lance’s girlfriend a gold digging hussy, Mother;” Frieda jumping in.<br />
<br />
“That’s enough Frieda,” Benton looking at Amanda; “it’s clear your mother wants to remain in denial.” Walking with his daughter, Benton looks back at a fuming black furred were-panthress; “You owe my parents as well as Lila and apology for your rudeness and you know it.” Closing the door to his study to leave Amanda alone with her thoughts, Benton sees Eric and Spencer looking on.<br />
“Well dinner could have gone better,” Benton sighing; “you two should not of had to have heard that, nor you Frieda.”<br />
“Will mother calm down,” Frieda asking; “or will she be ranting all night?”<br />
“Give her time,” Benton answering; “but let’s have a talk while we walk.”<br />
“About what,” Frieda asking as she and her father head outside; the crunching sound there paws made as they make contact with the snow. Pausing briefly as they watch the sun completely set.<br />
“Why a three hundred thousand dollar sports car,” Benton asking.<br />
“Because mom’s BMW got totaled in her car accident,” Frieda answering.<br />
“I’m not denying your mother needs a new car,” Benton looking at his daughter; “but the cost.”<br />
“Is chump change,” Frieda answering; “compared to the gas guzzling Lamborghini you over spent at an auction.”<br />
“I only over spent,” Benton sighing; “because a Saudi prince was bidding on the exact same car.”<br />
“Six million dollars for your car,” Frieda rolling her eyes; “and you want to nag at me for getting an electric car for mother for Christmas, apples and oranges dad.”<br />
<br />
Benton noticing his daughter called her dad for the second time today; he can’t help but smile. Kneeling down so he is eye level with her; Benton begins to speaking, hoping to bridge the divide between the two.<br />
“Frieda you have never known hardship,” Benton speaking; “poverty, and an uncertain future. I have,” Benton getting teary eyed; “my parents didn’t start out wealthy, we were dirt poor for a time. The stew dad made, that was his reminder of our past. A past I resent, loathe and despise with a passion. Frieda,” Benton hugging his daughter; “It’s why I work so extremely hard at times. I don’t ever want you to go through what I went through. All those times I missed watching you grow up, the missed opportunities to spend time with you, I regret it.”<br />
“Dad,” Frieda mumbling; “your crushing me.”<br />
“Sorry,” Benton letting go; “what I’m trying to say is, when you spend a lot of money like you did this morning. It makes me wonder if you know the value of a dollar. The fact that I made sure you have never wanted for nothing; I’m worried you might be more like your mother.”<br />
“I’m not a snob,” Frieda answering; “I don’t thumb my nose at people who are not wealthy.”<br />
“I know,” Benton answering; “but you like to shop just like your mother.”<br />
“Well of course,” Frieda answering; “I’m a girl after all. We all like to shop.”<br />
“That statement holds little comfort for me,” Benton shaking his head; “after the Christmas holidays, I’m changing the account attached to your card. There will be a monthly spending cap in place. I’m not going to tell you the amount, but if you need more money, you could always get,” Benton sighing; “an after school job.”<br />
“Won’t mother freak out about that,” Frieda looking at her father.<br />
“Oh of course,” Benton getting up and grinning; “anything your mother doesn’t understand causes her to panic. Now,” looking at Eric and Spencer who were following at a discreet distance; “I’m sure you three have some bizzare sex act you want to perform right?”<br />
“Not right yet,” Frieda answering; “in fact I was thinking we have a walk or a run before rutting.”<br />
“Okay,” Benton chuckling; “that’s fine. But if you find yourself getting ravenous later on, you three might want to consider hunting.”<br />
“Why,” Frieda asking; “there is still the leftover rabbit stew.”<br />
“Not for long,” Benton grinning; “while I’ll never admit this and will outright deny it if this is ever brought up in a conversation. I happen to like the rabbit stew your grandfather made today; don’t expect there to be much left after I’ve had a few more bowls.”<br />
“Well in that case,” Frieda looking at her friends; “let us have seconds before we have our fun then.”<br />
“Okay,” Benton placing a paw on his daughters shoulder; “let’s go and have some more supper.”<br />
<br />
Walking back into the kitchen, Benton watches Frieda grab some more bowls; helping her ladle out the rich and hearty concoction that is still warm, they each grab a few biscuits and a spoon and dig in. Benton watching his daughter as well as Eric and Spencer enjoy the stew; he can’t help but chuckle lightly. ‘These three are in for a wild ride,’ Benton eating his stew; ‘once they have cubs of their own.’<br />
“You know when you are done,” Benton speaking; “head upstairs and have your fun.”<br />
“Are you certain dad,” Frieda speaking; “you’re not going to feel sick when you hear us rut?”<br />
“The act of sex is nothing new to me Frieda,” Benton answers; “if your mother has calmed down, we might be doing some of our own.”<br />
“You know,” Eric licking his bowl clean; “this stew is like the lamb my mom made the other day. Delicious, but its making me yearn for something more.”<br />
“I know,” Spencer answering; “you up for hunting another buck Frieda?”<br />
“Woah,” Benton looking stunned; “you three hunted a buck?”<br />
“And ate it,” Frieda grinning; “that venison tasted sooooooo good.”<br />
“It was a four point buck,” Eric grins; “so it was still a young one. But dam that was fun.”<br />
<br />
Benton stares as he watches the three put their dishes into the dishwasher and thunder upstairs. Hearing Frieda’s door quickly open and then close. Finishing his bowl of stew and then ladling himself another. He quickly eats it up as he hears his daughter and Spencer giggling as they begin their fun with Eric.<br />
“A buck,” Benton thinking; “I don’t think I’ve had venison before. I wonder what it tastes like.”<br />
“Perhaps you should join them,” Amanda entering the kitchen; still looking angry but now not wanting to attack someone.<br />
“That is a thought,” Benton pondering; “want to join them later on?”<br />
“You got to be joking,” Amanda in an ill mood; “me hunt and consuming raw flesh?”<br />
“Why not,” Benton looking at his wife as she makes a sandwich; “if it means spending time with our daughter. Besides,” Benton looking thoughtful; “I’ve never hunted before.”<br />
“Me neither. To me, spending time with our daughter,” Amanda sighing; “is going to the salon, watching a movie together, helping with her homework perhaps. Not running out into the woods and acting like savage beasts.”<br />
Benton couldn’t help but laugh; “acting like savage beasts. Amanda, what do you think rutting is?”<br />
“That’s different,” Amanda answering; “I’m talking about taking down a wild animal with the intention of eating it.”<br />
“Nothing savage about that,” Benton answering; “besides, you might think its civilized to eat a fillet mignon, but remember; that came from a cow that was killed and slaughter for the purpose of consumption.”<br />
“What’s your point,” Amanda looking grumpy.<br />
“What’s more savage,” Benton answering; “knowing that the steak you just ate came from a bovine that die in a cruel and undignified manner, or eating the flesh of an animal you took down with your bare paws.”<br />
“What is wrong with you husband,” Amanda looking concerned; “did you take your medication?”<br />
“I took my meds,” Benton grinning; “as for what’s wrong, let’s just say my mother and father managed to knock some sense into me. But right now,” Benton grinning; “I’m keen on having some fun.”</p>
