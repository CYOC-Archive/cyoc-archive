<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Status Reminder<br />
1. Kari-Fuzzy arms, stealth bonus against Earth King followers.<br />
2. Richie-Is 10 years old, hawk eyes, naga.<br />
3. Angel-Hawk eyes, has potion of speed, in heat.<br />
4. Darwin-Naga.<br />
5. Ester-Vixen, Forest Guardian, forest camo, in heat.<br />
6. Micah-Rabbit's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think I will stay!&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
A card pops out in front of her and she draws it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It says, 'You have decided to stay with the Earth King's enemies, the men are pleased that you have not tried to escape and so they release <br />
you and for your trust they give you a something special, draw next card',&quot; she draws the next card as it appears.<br />
<br />
&quot;'The men lead you toward a tent and motion you in, inside you find a little girl, about eight years old, As one of the men turn to face you <br />
you see a potion in his hand, he then asks you a question, &quot;This girl has lost her family to the Earth King's Wolves, we were wondering if you <br />
would take her with you, and that you drink this potion to become her new mother. It is your decision, will you or not?&quot;, take some time and <br />
discuss this with other players'. Um...what do you guys think I should do?&quot; asked Kari as a bottle of red potion appears in her hand.<br />
<br />
Ester looks at you with a sad expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should, I mean think of how horrible it was for the girl to watch her own parents be killed,&quot; she said as a tear slid down her <br />
face.<br />
<br />
Richie looks at her with a shocked look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't be serious! She can't take a little girl along with her on this journey, she will only slow her down! And besides we don't even know <br />
what that potion will do!&quot;<br />
<br />
Angel glares at Richie with her hawk eyes making him flinch.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you say that? Think about it, the girl is in more danger if she stays with the enemy soldiers, what if the Earth king attacks them, <br />
they could kill her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darwin nods his head in agreement and turns to Richie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel's right Rich, the girl should go with Kari, she will be much safer with her. No more arguments!&quot; he shouts when Richie starts to <br />
protest, &quot;All those in favor of Kari becoming the little girl's mother, raise your right hand!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyones hand is raised, except for Richie's. Micah smiles and looks at Kari.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and go get your daughter!&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Kari smiles and pulls the cork from the bottle and drinks the potion. she suddenly stiffens and groans as pain flares through her body. She <br />
quickly pulls off her clothes and closes her eyes as the pain increases. Everyone stares in wonder as they watch her grow before their eyes. <br />
Kari grew in height about a few inches, her breasts which were a moderate B inflated to about a CC. her hair grew longer till it reached her <br />
mid back, the brown color darkening till it was almost black. Her rear pushed out a bit as her hips widened, followed by her thighs which <br />
toned. The pain stopped just as her skin gained a tanned look, as if she had spent her whole life outside.<br />
<br />
Then there was a flash of light that appeared on her clothes and they all watched, including Kari who had opened her eyes, as her clothes <br />
grew to fit her. When the light disappeared she put her clothes back on and looked down at her friends. Kari was now twenty-nine years old <br />
and she was a stunning beauty. Their attention was caught when another card popped out of Kari's side.<br />
<br />
Kari drew it and read it aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;'You have decided to become the girl's new mother, for that the men give you a pack of supplies, for the two of you, and a staff for your <br />
protection. The man who gave you the potion walk's up to you and gives you a kiss on the forehead, &quot;May the spirit's bless your new family <br />
with safety and health as you travel on. if you ever are in need of protection, blow this whistle and it shall call to you a new companion who <br />
will help you along the way, good luck my daughter!&quot; You then take the girl's hand in yours and leave the camp, move forward five spaces <br />
toward the forest,'&quot; As soon as Kari is done reading the card, noticing that her voice is an octave lower than before, she looks at her piece <br />
and notices that her piece is older as well and holding its hand is a small eight year old girl.<br />
<br />
Angel stares at the piece and sighs sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping that we would have been able to meet your daughter, Kari!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari continues to stare at the game board as she replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did I,&quot; she is interrupted as there is a flash of light beside her and a small girl with long black hair, blue eyes filled with happiness and a <br />
small dark green dress appears beside her.<br />
<br />
Everyone stares at the small child in shock. The little girl doesn't seem to notice them as she turns to face Kari. Her smile grew as she <br />
looked at the girl, now woman, with love in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy?&quot; she asks with a shaky voice, her smile wavering.<br />
<br />
Kari suddenly feels maternal instincts kicking in and she scoots closer to the girl and pulls her onto her lap, her arms holding her in a <br />
loving embrace. She bends down and gives her a kiss on her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sweetie, I am your mother now. I would very much like to know your name,&quot; Kari says in a soothing voice.<br />
<br />
The little girl then noticing the others looks at them with a fearful expression. Kari noticing the child's change quickly comforts her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh, it's okay sweetie, these are just some of mommy's friends, they are helping her find ways to defeat the Earth King and to free the land <br />
from his rule. they won't hurt you, I promise,&quot; she again soothingly says.<br />
<br />
Ester clears her throat gaining the girls attention. The girl's eyes widen as she takes in the Fox woman, along with her strange fur pattern <br />
and emerald necklace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-your the Forest Guardian!&quot; exclaims the girl with wonder filling her eyes.<br />
<br />
Ester chuckles, now noticing that her heat appears to be more controllable, and looks down at the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, little one, my name is Ester, the Guardian of the forest and I am one of your mother's friends, what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
The little girl looks at Ester, then at everyone else, with less fear in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Sarah,&quot; she says and then lets out a yawn.<br />
<br />
Kari smiles as she gives Sarah another kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Sarah, I think it's time for you to go to sleep. Do you want to sleep on the couch, or do you want to stay here with mommy?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
Sarah looks up at her new mother with a worried expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to stay here with you mommy,&quot; she says in a sleepy tone.<br />
<br />
Angel quickly heads for the bedroom and comes back with a pillow and a blanket. Kari then lays her daughter down and gives he one last <br />
kiss before she falls asleep. When she does she then turns to her friends with a smile and a tears sliding down her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't she just adorable?&quot; she asks in a whisper.<br />
<br />
Everyone nods and smiles, including Richie who had gotten over his stuborness. Darwin looks from Kari to Sarah and opens his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you can handle her, while we still play the game?&quot; he asks her in a low voice.<br />
<br />
Kari nods and hands the dice to Richie. she then turns back to her sleeping daughter and brushes a strand of hair from her face.<br />
<br />
Richie rolls the dice...</p>
