<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlotte was given the rest of the day to herself as she was still somewhat out of it from the math class. So, she had decided to spend it in her bedroom for the most part. This was for 3 reasons. The first was to put some distance between herself and her mother, at least to the best she could manage with the whole &quot;being literally chained down to the house&quot; and all. Additionally, this allowed her to fully explore her newly aquired pussy. This was something that before now, she had never even considered how it felt to have one, or how the other side feels. But as they say, when in Rome. So she was sort of looking forward to it. <br />
<br />
The last reason was to review the new knowledge she has just aquired. First of all, Magic was actually real! She should have figured that out by now, and felt like such an idiot for not doing so. She had doubted it all, and was desperatelytrying to convince herself that this was entirely all a really vivid nightmare. But thanks to the class, and her Mother&#39;s lesson, she now understood that this was reality, but kore importantly, she could do magic if only she tried hard enough to learn it. This was her current hope. Its what kept her from cracking entirely. It was likely her last chance to find an out for this entire situation. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, she now understood that she would never escape this ordeal completely unscathed. She knew she already had a few chips and cracks in her mentality. Such as how now even the thought if disobeying her Mother was enough to make her tremble. What was even worse, was that she knew somehow, she had develooed some semblance of an emotional attachment to her too. A small part of her had accepted Hildia as being her actual step-mother. As much as she disliked the thought that such a person now belonged to her family, that tiny grain of knowledge was rooted for eternty in her mind. No mater how hard she tried to deny it, that grain of knowledge wouldn&#39;t let her forget that she was now this woman&#39;s adopted daughter. <br />
<br />
Of course she wasn&#39;t legally related by any means, but she now instinctivly felt that Hildia was her mother. The mental conditioning was really starting to take deep roots, and she understood that couldn&#39;t do anything to stop it besides leaving this place asap. If she ever somehow became content with her new life as Charlotte, it would be all over for her chance of returning ti her former life.<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, Charlotte stopped herself yet again from thinking such negative thoughts. She returned her attention back to the current task at hand. Holding up the dildo she had found in her closet, she once again moved it slowly down towards her bare pussy. She was so horny, and yet she just couldn&#39;t bring herself to use it. She was a guy, and guys fuck pussies, not get fucked in their pussy. If she fucked herself with the dildo, it would make her have to acknowledge that she was entirely a girl now. Out of convince, she had not fought against her new name, nor the pronoun swap. Both of those had happened either naturally, or while her Mother was around. So she had little choice in the matter. But this was entirely on her. If she caved in and masturbated with the dildo, she had to admit that she had also chosen to be a girl. <br />
<br />
With a few more secpnds spent hovering the tip only a few inches away, she was finally able to set it down. Falling backwards onto her bed, Charlotte moved her focus to the magical knowledge she had been given. It was hardly anything to seriously go off of, and from what she did have, she understood practically none of it. But her curiosity had been ignited. Since she could no longer swim competitively, she may as well just become a witch and escape from her Mother&#39;s grasp. <br />
<br />
It was at this moment that a knock came from her door. However, unlike what she expected, it wasn&#39;t her Mother that came into her room before she could even answer. In fact no one had entered at all. A second round of knocks sounded, prompting Charlotte to quickly put her clothes back on and in a hurry answered the door. To her surprise it wasn&#39;t her Mother, but what looked like a floating suit the &quot;head&quot; was empty, and was the only &quot;exposed&quot; area, as the rest of the body was completely coveree up by clothing. On what would have been the face, simply floated a white expressionless mask with only 2 eyeholes and a rather generic facial profile. <br />
<br />
The &quot;thing&quot; then pulled out what seemed to be a business card and a letter from his pocket, before handing them both to Charlotte with a respectful bow where &quot;it&quot; also removed &quot;its&quot; top hat. Then the &quot;thing&quot; seemed to disintegrate completely until nothing was left except for a cold draft which quickly dissipated. Looking now at the letter and card, Charlotte went back inside her room and started to examine the card first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Magical Courier Services&quot;<br />
<br />
That was it. Nothing else was on the card. So she set it aside and looked at the letter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Charlotte, <br />
<br />
I felt that now it would be appropriate to introduce you slowly to the world of magic, starting with the MCS. Think of them as mailmen, but with the speed of a text. The reason why witches do not often just text, is because texting is limited to Earth only. So texting across pocket dimensions is impossible. I will explaing those to you once I smarten you up some more, as right now it simply is completely beyond your capability to comprehend. And I do not mean you any offense by saying that either. It is just purely a fact. But back to what I was saying. This is where the MCS plays its best role. They can cross dimensional barriers. Again, likely too advanced stuff for you. <br />
<br />
Anyways, to use them, simply just write a letter, fold it in at least half. Then write the recipient&#39;s name in a box with MCS underneath it. Finally, just say &quot;Magical Courier Services&quot; out loud and hand the Courier the letter when he or she arrives and tell them the name of the recipient while picturing their face in your head. That is it. Simple right?<br />
<br />
Well, dinner will be ready in 15 if you want, or you can go back to struggling with whether or not you want to masturbate because if a dumb, not to mention pointless internal struggle you seem to be throwing yourself into. You ARE a girl now, so just fuck youself already and get over it. I didn&#39;t just give you the rest of the day off so you can waste it by doing nothing. But, since you seem to not be convinced yet... there, now you can&#39;t deny it really anymore. <br />
<br />
Love Mama&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte shuddered as an odd sensation washed over her. She looked all over her body, but it was unchanged. The only difference was that her nipples were now way more sensitive to her top rubbing against them. Charlotte, who was now somewhat embarrassed that her Mother knew exactly what was going on, set down the letter on her bed, got undressed once again, and grabbed the dildo. &quot;Alright fine? Huh?&quot; She said, now speaking in a voice now much more fitting for a girl her age. It was clear, with a slightly melodic sound to it, and it wasn&#39;t too high pitched either. &quot;So I now sound like a girl. Great. Thanks Mama.&quot; She said, with about 60% sarcasm. The other 40% was genuine thankfulness though, as now her voice actually fit her continuously femenizing body so much better. So without anymore hesitation, Charlotte finally used the dildo. Needless to say, she didn&#39;t come down to eat, nor for the rest of the night.</p>
