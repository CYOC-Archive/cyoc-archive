<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Inside Malarkey's Uniform Plus, Maggie watched as the other two girls disappeared into the crowd of people. Walking quickly to catch up to them, she heard them talking about something or other.<br />
<br />
The younger of the two was saying, &quot;You know, I didn't realized this, but I was here when I transformed into a Neko.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girl had nothing to say to this and merely nodded in response. Seeing an opening, Maggie rushed over and tapped the older one of the two on the shoulder to get her attention.<br />
<br />
As the girl turned around, Maggie cleared her throat and asked, &quot;Do you think I could talk to you two somewhere private?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other one turned and right away demanded, &quot;What's this about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking about Maggie finally said, &quot;I'm sorry. I accidentally overheard part of your conversation. I was wondering what you know of the Amulet of Zulo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gasping both girls looked at Maggie and then the older one said, &quot;My name is Beth and this is Carrie. At one time our names were James and Serj. I suppose we should go somewhere more private to talk all this over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we go to my place?&quot; Maggie offered. &quot;I can show you the amulet I found. Did you two find one as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Carrie and Beth shook their heads and Beth said rather dejectedly, &quot;We don't know how we changed. We think it has something to do with the amulet. I'll explain my story, just not right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly exiting the store, the three girls made there way back to Maggie's place of residence. Luckily, her family was not home, so there would be no awkward questions asked. Inside her room, Maggie crossed to where she kept her jewelry and stopped at what she saw.<br />
Picking the Amulet of Zulo up from where she had left it, she turned to the other girls. Holding it out, Maggie commented, &quot;This was cracked when my brother hit it with a hammer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie and Beth both looked at the medallion. It was exactly like the one in their dreams, but clearly had no crack on it. Turning it over, they saw no crack on the other side. What they saw was a strange figure. Half of it's face appeared masculine, while the other half looked feminine. The nose looked like it could have belonged to a cat, while the ears looked like some type of wolf or fox ears. As they were examining the rest, the figure was clearly naked and showing other transformations, Maggie asked, &quot;So you two used to be males and you both woke up after dreaming about the Amulet of Zulo to find yourselves turned into females.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie looked up and getting a worried look on her face, looked at Beth and the back to Maggie. Clearing her throat, she reached up a removed the band holding her hair and said, &quot;Not quite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the next hour, all three girls swapped stories. It was mostly Beth and Maggie, seeing as Carrie could not exactly remember her dream in full. Afterward, Maggie showed the other girls her brother’s room, which now looked more looked like a little girls room. After that, she showed them the costume her mother had made for her when she was about seven.<br />
<br />
Unsure of where to go next, they were interrupted by the sound of Maggie's family returning home. A little girl by the name of Alexa was being told she could go out and play.<br />
<br />
Entering the kitchen, Maggie, Carrie and Beth were greeted by Judy, who automatically demanded to know who they were and why they were in her house. Afterward, Maggie was chewed out and told that if she brought friends over, she was to let her know in advance.<br />
Looking at Carrie and Beth, Maggie said, &quot;Let's go over to your house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, watching the formidable looking woman, Beth said quietly, &quot;We can go over to my house. My parents won't mind at all. Bring the amulet with you, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, Maggie said she would be right back. Dashing to her room, she grabbed the amulet where it had been left on her vanity. Making sure nothing else had been taken, she locked her room and made her way back to the kitchen. In the kitchen, Judy was cleaning something for a change and said rather coldly, &quot;Your friends are waiting for you outside.&quot;<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Meeting her new friends outside, they quickly made their way to the library instead. Over the next couple of hours, they spent the time looking for any information on the Amulet of Zulo. The closet they could get was a website they found just when their time was up and all they could get was that there was a twelve hour time limit before a person could transform again. Puzzling this over, the three ladies made their way to Beth's house, which was as deserted as she had said.<br />
<br />
Inside Beth's room, they talked for hours on end, mostly on wondering if the twelve hour time frame was right. Finally they decided that they would just have to try it out for themselves. Beth and Carrie were a bit nervous and voiced an opinion of whether it would actually work. Finally Maggie came up with a solution.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try it.&quot; She announced. &quot;After all, my life sucks and is currently going nowhere. If this information turns out to be wrong, maybe I could start over as someone new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But who would you become?&quot; Carrie asked.<br />
<br />
Maggie looked thoughtful for a minute and than said, &quot;How about either James or Serj? That way your present if one of your moms starts to ask questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie and Beth thought this a good idea and started bickering about who she would become. Finally, Maggie suggested a coin toss, with heads being James and tails being Serj. Thinking this a good idea, Beth went to look for a quarter. Returning shortly, she showed it to the others and then flipped it.<br />
<br />
Catching the quarter in the palm of her hand, she flipped her hand over and slapped it onto the back of her hand. Drawing her hand away, she showed the tail side of the quarter to Carrie and Maggie.<br />
<br />
The next order of business was for Carrie to go and collect some of her clothes for the transformation. A short time later, she was back with a pair of underwear, pants, socks, and a shirt. Carrie had even collected the shoes from the garage. Grinning, slightly embarrassed, Maggie asked, &quot;Can you two step out while I try the medallion?&quot;<br />
Nodding, both Beth and Carrie stepped out, leaving Maggie the clothes. Stripping naked, she took the Amulet of Zulo from her purse and not sure of what to do, touched it to Serj's underwear.<br />
<br />
The affect was immediate. A blue spark jumped from the amulet to the underwear, back to the medallion and then into her hand. Dropping the piece of jewelry, she noticed her height didn't change, but her muscle structure altered itself to a male. She felt her weight shift and watched as her breast melted into her body. As this happened, she felt a strange sensation coming from her groin and abdomen.<br />
<br />
Looking past her rapidly flattening chest, she watched as a teenage penis and testicles formed. As this happened, hair began to grow over her legs, groin, and armpits; her chest and arms still remained hairless. Within a couple of moments, the transformation was over and Maggie May, now Serj, was slowly trying to get dressed.<br />
Afterward, she opened the door and greeted the others. For some strange reason, she found Beth to be really cute and her penis was doing something strange; it was becoming hard.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to say, Serj finally asked, &quot;Shall we remain here or go back to my house?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was agreed that they return to the Dennison residence. On the way there, the three stopped at a gas station to buy snacks. While there, Serj used the men's room and bought something he thought he might need.<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Arriving home, Miss. Dennison was not there, only another note that said she had gone out for the evening and dinner was in the fridge.<br />
As Carrie was removing the meal, Serj felt that odd sensation come over him and noticing the looks Beth kept giving him, gently pulled her toward his bedroom. Not sure what to do, he sat down and was joined by Beth after she had locked the door.<br />
<br />
Leaning over, he kissed her on the mouth and she returned the kiss. Suddenly he wanted to feel her breast and slowly reached up her shirt and began to clumsily massage her left breast.<br />
<br />
Breaking away, Beth reached down and pulled up on the bottom of her shirt and pulling it over her head, exposed her pert breast and erect nipples. Standing, she undid her dress and let it fall to the floor. Except for her socks, she was completely naked.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to do, Serj sat there for a minute and then pulled his shirt off. Standing, he undid his pants and as he pushed the off, he leaned over and kissed the beautiful woman in front of him. Kicking out of his pants, he stopped briefly and withdrew the condom from his pants pocket. Fumbling with it, he eventually managed to slip it over his erect member.<br />
<br />
Taking Beth, he gently laid her down on the bed and began to kiss her again as he first massaged her nipples, then reached down and began to massage her Clitoris. As he felt the juices begin to flow, he slipped his erect member into her vagina.<br />
<br />
As a woman, Maggie May had never known this feeling and it kind of took her by surprise when her first time having sex came when she was a young man. Blowing her male load into the condom, she heard Beth moan with pleasure as she achieved orgasm. Afterward they both lay there, breathing heavily before finally Serj got and disposing the condom properly, began to get dressed. After a bit, Beth began to do the same.<br />
<br />
Going out to the kitchen, Carrie merely glanced at them both, but did not say anything.<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
It was twelve hours later and Serj had collected Maggie May's clothes. Hopping that it would not work, he was disappointed as the previous events repeated themselves and he changed back into a she. Putting on her clothes, she went outside the room she transformed in and looking at the others and said, &quot;It worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
But there was small problem. Beth didn't want to change back and now Carrie was having second thoughts as well. Plus, Maggie wanted to find something to alter her, just so she could find out if it was possible to have a happy life.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are going to do?&quot; They all asked in unison.</p>
