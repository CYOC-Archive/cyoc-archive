<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl was a model scout and photographer he had recruited a number of models who had become famous. He was very well built at 6 feet. He had blond hair and had been the quarter-back in school. There was increasing demand for African women, Carl was a bit racist and felt that black women were dull. If he had to present a black model he would look for something strange. A black woman with blue eyes, a black woman with dyed hair or someone like Obama, half black/half white. <br />
<br />
His last catch was a black woman with redhair due to weird recessive genes in her family. He was in Lincoln park. Here beautiful women would walk through the park, jogging, with their boyfriends or other girlfriends. He was looking for a lone girl that he would approach and work his magic. <br />
<br />
Then he saw her, standing alone on the grass. Nearly six feet high, she had long legs that were exposed in the sunlight with a light tan. Muscular they are legs that belonged to a runner or a swimmer. She wore black heeled boots with black zippered leggings to her knees. A black pleated skirt and a black cropped sweater that exposed her flat stomach. Her face looked like that of a Queen with chin that came to a pleasing point with a slight clef and a nose . With high cheek bones, a pleasantly round face and dark brown eyes that seem to see through people. Carl felt like he should bow in the presence of this woman.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were sizable pushing their mass with diamond shaped nipples into the fabric. She would be a good C if not D cup woman. If he had to guess her age it would be early 20s. However something was off about her. She seemed to not look at the men or the women, she looked at the dogs. One dog playing catch ignored the ball and ran up to her. The woman knelt down to touch the dog, a male German Shepard, and his bright red penis came out. <br />
<br />
The woman patted the dog as the owners were horrified by the sight especially such a beautiful woman. The somewhat obese owner was gushing with apologies for his misbehaving dog. She looked at him as if he was the bad dog. He apologized and dragged his dog away from the woman. She frowned as if she wanted his death for his treatment of his dog.<br />
<br />
Carl introduced himself to woman and asked for her name. &quot;Ginger&quot; she said in a husky voice. He told her that she was very striking when he noticed some sort of collar around her swan like neck. The collar was made out of dark leather and was complete with a D-ring to connect a leash to it. However it seemed big enough to fit onto her around her neck. <br />
<br />
He asked for two pictures and he took them. The first picture she posed for showed her toned body on an angle to the Carl. She was the idea of a redhead/white woman. Her breasts pressing into the fabric, her fiery red locks framing a regal face. Her face was that of a Greek Goddess surveying her lands. The collar was visible, however it seemed to take her attention. He asked for the next photo if it could be covered up.<br />
<br />
The next photo was face on showing her body but an upper shot. She had tucked her hair behind her ears and covered the collar. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are a very beautiful woman Ginger.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at him with that same Imperious face that made him feel chilly in the middle of a park on a sunny day. Carl asked her if she was able to model, she shook her head. He asked if he could keep the photos in his portfolio and she nodded. She had not said a word, yet she knew enough English. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look would you like some modelling work? It pays well, are you on social media? Insta?&quot; <br />
<br />
She shook her head again, as if he were some peasant wasting the time of the Goddess Aphrodite. She made a &#39;come here&#39; gesture to Carl and he followed. Just as any red blooded male would she took him down the sunny streets as her dress fluttered in the wind showing her backside. She had a full, well propitiated ass that he made him horny. <br />
<br />
She took him inside a seemingly abandoned apartment, was this some kind of trap. Ginger came out naked her white skin seemed to glow in the fading light of the sun. Her breasts were perky B cups but the rest of her body was painfully thin. He could count her ribs and the knobbly parts of her spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip&quot; she growled.<br />
<br />
He did so reluctantly showing his boner, during this entire time he felt inadequate as in every way. With surprising strength he was pushed over exposing his asshole. Something hard and rubbery was slipped into his ass. He felt like his skin was on fire as he collapsed onto all fours, his head started to jut forward and narrow into a smaller head. His cock turned as red as lipstick with a furry sheath as the hair grew out of every pour in his skin.<br />
<br />
His tail bone extended and became hairy as his eyes turned from blue to dark brown. His ears shrunk and elongated until they became floppy.  His nose black and leathery, and his canines protruding.  Hair that was blond in color spurted all over his body as his thoughts became more canine and soon he took the shape an adult male Golden Retriever. <br />
<br />
 &quot;My owner&#39;s friend was a bastard named Kal. He took this collar (she pointed to what sat on her throat) and tried out the magic. It turned his sister Katy into a dog, he wanted to see what it would do to an Irish Setter such as I am.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her nude, muscular body, moved in a way that showed she was agitated. Muscles moved in her skinny body and flexed. Like a snake ready to strike. Nude she sat down in an armchair and wrapped her long legs around her showing a pubic mound of red hair before she got comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;In this place Kal would take me &#39;walkies&#39; and then turn me into a bitch, human as you see. He would fuck me and then turn me back. It must have been a perfect deal for him.&quot; she barked with laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;However Carl, like Kal, a human form meant a human mind at first, but over time I learnt the human ways. Each time I was turned into a woman I learned to become a woman until a got my freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned the dildo in Carl&#39;s ass making him whine like she had as a dog to not be taken away from her owner. <br />
<br />
&quot;I needed you to feel the change and understand before I tell you my story. This&quot; she fingered her cursed collar &quot;is what keeps me in the body of a woman. If I was a dog then you would walk past me like in the park. I am going to let you spend a week as a dog, there is food and water here, with that dildo up your ass before you get to post my pictures online. See you in 7 days Carl, see if anyone notices you are gone. Like a dog trapped in a hot car by careless owners lets see if you can last.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl whined and whimpered as Ginger dressed in her clothes and shut the door.</p>
