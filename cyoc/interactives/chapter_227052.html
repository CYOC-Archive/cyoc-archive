<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As morning approached, Persis heard a man’s voice outside of her bottle.<br />
<br />
“Huh?  What’s this?”<br />
<br />
She felt her bottle being lifted off the ground and into the air.<br />
<br />
“I don’t remember buying anything like this before.”<br />
<br />
As the man peeked into the bottle’s opening, Persis grinned, and rose dramatically from her bottle in a rush of purple smoke, her startled master nearly dropping her bottle in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have summoned Persis, genie of the bottle!”  She bellowed, rising to tower over him.  “State your wish, and I shall grant it!”<br />
<br />
The man leapt back, keeping his eyes fixed on Persis.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?  A genie?  A snake-girl genie?  Am I dreaming?  Did that smoke have some kind of drug in it?”<br />
<br />
Persis giggled, and lowered herself to eye-level with her new master, looking him over.<br />
<br />
The man was in his late twenties, a few inches shy of six feet.  He wasn’t big enough to be called fat, but he wasn’t skinny, either.  His black hair had been cut very short, and his green eyes were wide with panic!<br />
<br />
Persis took a more submissive posture.<br />
<br />
“My apologies, Master.  I enjoy making an entrance.  But I assure you, this is no dream, or drug.  You have been given the blessing of a lifetime, Master.  Ah, but where are my manners?  Please tell me, my Master, how shall I address you?”<br />
<br />
“Uh…  My name is Leonard Owens.”<br />
<br />
“Very well then, Master Leonard.  I shall grant you three wishes, with a few limitations.  I cannot change the past, I cannot bring the dead back to life, and I will not grant any wish made with the intention of hurting others.  So tell me, Master, what is it your heart desires?”<br />
<br />
“Any wish?”  Leonard shook his head.  “Oh man…  I could live out my wildest dreams…  But if I don’t use at least one wish for something like world peace, that’d be a dick move…”<br />
<br />
Persis laughed.  “If it helps you feel any better, Master, there are also many wishes that I may consider granting, but would be difficult to bring about without unpleasant side-effects.  World peace is one of them.  Even the gentler ways to go about it would require the non-consenting alteration of billions of minds, bodies, or both.” <br />
<br />
Leonard paused.  “I hadn’t thought of it that way.”<br />
<br />
“Besides, you have three wishes to use.  I won’t judge you if you use at least one for yourself.  Let me hear your ‘wildest dreams!’  You only live once.”<br />
<br />
“Well… you might not judge me for making a selfish wish, but you could judge me for a weird one.”<br />
<br />
“Nonsense, Master Leonard.  I’d be happy to listen.”<br />
<br />
“…Okay.  I’ve wanted to become one of my, er… do you know what a ‘fursona’ is?”<br />
<br />
Persis nodded.<br />
<br />
“Well, I have one, but it’s a little unconventional. Her name is Kimberly, and she’s a vixen…”  his voice softened to whisper as he looked away awkwardly.  “…sex doll.”<br />
<br />
Persis blinked.  “A sex doll, Master?”<br />
<br />
“You said you weren’t going to judge me!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not!  I just…  I seek to grant wishes in a way that would not harm my masters or mistresses, and I want to be sure this is something you truly desire.  If you could wish to be anything, why would you wish to be a sex doll?  To just be an object for satisfying people’s base desires?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I wouldn’t want to be JUST an object.  I’d imagined Kimberly as a living doll.  But there are a lot of reasons.  I mean, for one thing, I can look hot for years, without ever aging.  I wouldn’t need to worry about eating or sleeping, or getting sick.  I can enjoy sex without any consequences.  And because of that, I could help lonely people feel a little better, and bring them some pleasure, work off stress, while having an actual personality that can show them real love.  Plus, rubber is just kinda sexy.”<br />
<br />
Persis rested her chin on her hand.  That second-to-last comment reminded her a lot of the wish that had put her in this bottle.  She was now, in some ways, an object, someone who entered others’ lives to grant them some happiness, and a friendly face, for as long as she could stay, before vanishing.  She was probably immortal, too.<br />
<br />
“I think I understand.”  Persis nodded.  “I believe I can grant that wish a few ways without harming you.  The first, would be to let you trigger a change between your forms with a certain phrase or motion, and let Kimberly become a secret identity of sorts for you, that you can let out around those that you trust, or feel could help.  The other would be to change you semi-permanently into your vixen form, and enchant you so that anyone who looks at you does not find you strange.  Though it is a tricky matter, I could even make it so your friends and family ‘recognize’ you, while thinking of you as Kimberly.”<br />
<br />
“Could you do both?  A triggerable change, but people still recognize me?”<br />
<br />
“Well, now that I think of it…”<br />
<br />
“On second thought…  No.  I want to stand out.  For now, at least.  And if I want it to be permanent, all I have to do is never say the return trigger.  Persis, did you say your name was?  I wish to be able to switch between my human male self, and my living love doll vixen, Kimberly, with all the attributes I’d imagined for her, whenever I say ‘swap time’ three times in a row.”<br />
<br />
“Very well, Master Leonard, soon to be Mistress Kimberly!  Say the words right now, and I shall get to work!”<br />
<br />
Leonard grinned wide.  “Swap time, swap time, swap time!”<br />
<br />
Persis’s eyes glowed and she snapped her fingers, causing a cloud of smoke to spring up around Leonard.<br />
<br />
Leonard felt chills go up his spine as the smoke swirled around him.  His whole body felt warmer, and lighter, starting in his torso.  First, he noticed he no longer felt hungry, even though his stomach was emptier than he could ever remember.  His heart stopped beating, his lungs stopped breathing, everything in his arms, legs, and head remained in motion purely through Persis’s magic.<br />
<br />
“This feels so weird…  But good, too…”<br />
<br />
He pulled off his clothes, watching through the purple smoke as his skin smoothed over, turning orange and shiny, with a patch of white across the front of his body.<br />
<br />
His arms began to feel lighter, as bone and blood dissolved into empty air beneath the skin as it turned to orange rubber across the upper half, and black rubber from the elbows down.  His fingers remained as dexterous as ever, perhaps even a little more flexible.  He wiggled them excitedly, imagining how he’d be able to better pleasure partners with them.<br />
<br />
His legs followed, his thighs inflating into a shapely, feminine size, while his toes bulged into puffy paws.  His feet rose up into a digitigrade stance naturally.  Leonard could just picture his new self, dancing effortlessly, drifting light as a feather as she twirled, pirouetted, and showed off her body.<br />
<br />
Leonard felt lightheaded, as the rubber crawled up his neck, painting his head orange and white.  His mind was steadily feeling more and more comfortable thinking of herself as Kimberly. Her hair joined together into one big lump, before puffing up into a ponytail that trailed down to her back.  Her ears popped into a triangular shape, moving up the sides of her head.  Her nose turned dark and she let out a moan, her mouth feeling a dozen times more sensitive, as her throat sealed up, and her teeth grew into four dull, rubbery fangs.  <br />
<br />
She could feel her skull, and even her brain, dissolving into nothing but hot, horny air, and she couldn’t help but giggle through her growing snout.  Any feeling of shame at being naked, or wanting sex, seemed more and more like a distant dream.  Her human, male mind was drifting slowly into a sensual toy vixen’s.  More and more, every inch of her body was feeling like a minor erogenous zone, and she felt a burning desire, a desperate need to show off, to tease and titillate, to love and please, to fuck and be fucked.  One of her hands drifted all over her form, while the other grabbed for her still-fleshy cock.<br />
<br />
Leonard started breathing faster, and felt the extra air rushing in blowing into her torso, and from there, her cock.  She licked her lips with her rubber tongue as she felt the air pumping into it, swelling it thicker, longer, tighter.  She wasn’t just becoming a vixen sex doll, she was becoming a hermaphrodite, too, able to inflate and display, or deflate and hide, her shaft to fit the desires of her partners. She moaned, feeling as the tip became pointed, and a knot formed at the base, her balls bulging between her legs.   <br />
<br />
Her waist grew tighter and narrower, while her hips and ass swelled wider, and wider, and she eagerly squeezed the latter with her free hand.  Beneath her balls, a second hole opened, its folds tight enough to please any that entered, but stretchy enough to allow for almost any size.  She panted, and began to furiously finger herself.  <br />
<br />
Behind her, she could feel her new tail gradually inflating, puffing up like a wide cylinder, that gradually shrank to a point at the end.  As it came under her control, she found it to be incredibly flexible, folding any way she pleased.  And just in time; her chest was beginning to feel incredibly sensitive around her nipples, the skin around the puffing up a little more with each gasping breath she took.  She moved the hand she’d been fingering herself with up to the her rising bust, and slipped the tip of her tail between her legs, and into her rubber pussy.<br />
<br />
She groped and kneaded at her breasts, each grasp producing a gasp pulling in enough air to shoot them up a cup size.  From A to B to C they went in Kimberly’s hand, then D, before finally stopping at a bouncy, round E cup.  <br />
<br />
She couldn’t hold back the pleasure anymore.  With a yelp of delight, she fell to her back, the smoke clearing around her as she shook in orgasmic bliss.  A release without a hint of fluid, as her body squeaked and creaked in bliss.<br />
<br />
Her breathing slowed as the pleasure waned, (though, now that even a gentle breeze felt like a lover’s tease, it didn’t fade completely,) and looked up at the smiling Persis.<br />
<br />
“I take it you are happy with your wish, Mistress Kimberly?”<br />
<br />
Unnaturally light on her feet, Kimberly sprung up, and hugged Persis, her massive, squeaky bust practically enveloping Persis’s more modest chest.<br />
<br />
“I LOVE it!  I don’t think I’ll ever want to switch back!”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you approve!”  Persis blushed.  “Though you’ll likely have to, eventually.  You may not need to eat like this, but if you want a home, you’ll need to keep a job.  Unless you make another wish to deal with that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I already have another wish in mind!”</p>
