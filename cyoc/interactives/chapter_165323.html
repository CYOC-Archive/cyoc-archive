<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric knew he had all the control. From what he could see on the Chronivac, he could keep Aiden in that chastity cage for eternity, and he would just sit there, permanently horny.<br />
<br />
But what was the fun in that?<br />
<br />
“I’ll think about what you said,” Eric said to the sentient, locked cock. “But for now, I think it’s probably best if you had some time by yourself.”<br />
<br />
Having said that, Eric took Aiden and walked towards his bedroom.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing,” Aiden said frantically. “Where are you putting me?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe you’d fit in my underwear drawer,” Eric said. “Being a cock, and all.” He opened his top drawer and placed the chaste cock inside, covering him in some unfolded clean briefs.<br />
<br />
“Aiden, please! No!” Aiden said.<br />
<br />
Eric closed the drawer, silencing Aiden for the time being. He walked back into the living room and sat down at the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
One thing was for certain; Eric wasn’t going to be releasing Aiden from his control for the foreseeable future. As a roommate, he was terrible. If he wasn’t going to be paying his share of the rent, he was going to need another job. He was almost more useful as a cock than as a person. Almost.<br />
<br />
There was something very alluring about keeping Aiden on edge. Probably because he only thought with his cock anyways. Why else would he have (even accidentally) ended up as one?<br />
<br />
Eric clicked around in the Chronivac. He was going to have fun with this one.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
It has been all weekend since Aiden had turned himself into a cock. He had lost track of the time, only feeling his new cock body grow increasingly hornier as he perpetually tried to harden in the cage, involuntarily learning the limits of his restraint. This is not what he had intended when he bought the Chronivac. Not only was he a cock, but he was under the control of someone else. It was a far cry from the things he had wanted to try out himself.<br />
<br />
Aiden finally felt the drawer move, the underwear muffling him shuffled off, the light hitting his form.<br />
<br />
“Aiden!” Eric said, picking up his prize. “Fancy seeing you again.”<br />
<br />
“Please, Eric,” Aiden pleaded. “No more. This is terrible. I can’t even explain what it’s like.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it, roomie,” he said, lifting the cock to his face.<br />
<br />
“I’m just…so bored, and horny! And I can’t do anything about it.” Aiden started to strain in his cage, and he felt a drop of precum flow from his throat out through his piss-slit.<br />
<br />
Eric laughed at the dripping Aiden. “I can see that! I imagine you’d like a good orgasm right about now!”<br />
<br />
“Turn me back first,” Aiden pleaded, sounding like he was drowning in his own cum.<br />
<br />
“Cum for me first,” Eric replied. “Then we will talk.”<br />
<br />
Eric walked the caged cock to the kitchen. He laid out a shot glass on the counter. He fetched the keys from his pocket and unlocked Aiden. He laughed as the cock instantly grew erect.<br />
<br />
“See that glass, Aiden,” Eric said. “That is where your cum is going.”<br />
<br />
“Why,” Aiden gargled.<br />
<br />
“Cause,” Eric replied. “I wanna see how much you make.”<br />
<br />
With that, Eric took the now erect Aiden and started to pump him up and down. Aiden himself felt that same body-extending pleasure that he’d felt a few days before, but it seemed heightened now that he had been denied for so long.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before the sperm began spurting from his mouth/cock-slit. Eric was careful to make sure that it all made it into the glass.<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Eric said, chuckling to himself. “You sure are a hefty producer! Well, I’m guessing you want to have hands and legs again.”<br />
<br />
Aiden was groggy from the forced orgasm. But he was still able to mutter, “yes. Please.”<br />
<br />
Eric placed Aiden on the floor. He walked over to the Chronivac and pressed a single button.<br />
<br />
In a matter of three seconds, Aiden felt himself warp and change, growing features, limbs, and being restored to his human state. He had barely taken his first breath in days before Eric snapped a metal collar around his neck.<br />
<br />
Aiden snapped back around and looked at the grinning Eric. “What…what the hell, Eric?”<br />
<br />
“The collar is a good reminder that I am still in control, roomie,” Aiden said. “I think you’ll do well as my naked, collared, eunuch slave.”<br />
<br />
Looking down at his naked crotch, Aiden noticed now that, in fact, he was completely smooth and completely bare down there. Moments ago, he has been a cock and balls. Now, he didn’t have either. Instead, all he had was a small slit for peeing.<br />
<br />
“What is going on?” Aiden felt his flat crotch in bewilderment.<br />
<br />
“I just said. You’re my slave now,” Eric said. “You can call me master.”<br />
<br />
“Dude, that’s my computer program,” he retorted. “You can’t just use it to do whatever you want to me. I bought it!”<br />
<br />
“Well, I like him better,” the Chronivac piped up. “I hadn’t been installed nearly a minute, and you were already treating me like garbage. Eric treats me like the high-tech that I am!”<br />
<br />
Aiden had forgotten that the program was, in fact, sentient. Or at least acted like it. But the odds were against him: one magic computer and one roommate turned master against a naked, cockless slave.<br />
<br />
“Why are you doing this?” Aiden whined.<br />
<br />
“You’re not that great of a roommate,” Eric replied. “Besides, like I said. It’s fun! Who knows, you might like it. And if you don’t, just tell me. I’m happy to turn you back into a cock. You’ll be just as horny this way, I promise. You’ll just have to take care of it by taking my fat cock up your ass.”</p>
