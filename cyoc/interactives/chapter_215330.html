<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a usual weekend for Charlie Caswell.<br />
<br />
Departing from his home, making sure to pack a nice, warm coat for the road, kissing his girlfriend Gabriella goodbye, and making sure he was dressed for the night&#39;s theme. Making sure he kept his girlfriend&#39;s packed lunch with him. One more time in the car, Charlie took a look at his reflection. Big, well coiffed light, light brown pompadour hair, styled every week, thick, kissable lips on a handsome face. Everyone called him &quot;Hollywood&quot;, because he looked like a Movie Star with his moisturized face, hairless cheeks, and boyish smile. <br />
<br />
His light green eyes twinkled in the fading light of the evening, the sun just cresting over the horizon. And as always whenever he drove out to the big city of San Francisco, the sun would set a deal before he arrived at The Bridge Scarlet, the place he worked. The Bridge Scarlet was packed between two buildings - a sex store helmed by a drag queen named Miss Dominique, and a store that had been several dozen things over the past years - now, it was some kind of home supplies store. The Bridge Scarlet was bright red, about two stories tall - for a VIP lounge - and you could smell the perfume in the air long before you stepped inside.<br />
<br />
Charlie was dressed tonight like a fetishized police officer. His collar popped, and his powerfully muscled pecs showing, very, very light hair leading down to the start of his strong, tightly toned six pack. The sleeves were short and tight - accentuating the swoop of his tricep and the bulge of his bicep, even his forearms seemed strong, well formed. The tight police style pants were made tight at the groin, taking Charlie&#39;s existing generous endowment and making it seem to lewdly bulge forth all the more. The seat of the pants likewise was thinner material than most - letting every dimple on his ass show.<br />
<br />
The last time he went in on a theme night, he was dressed up as more or less a wet dream college jock. And the next time, who knew. The boss was the one that made those calls. He breathed as he started the car up and headed out. He and his girlfriend had, at the start at least, had some...issues over his line of work. Mostly in that he basically made a living by gyrating on and going the distance with his male clientele.<br />
<br />
Gabriella had at first been insecure about their sex life, and what Charlie being involved so sexually with men at the job might mean for their relationship. He&#39;d assuaged her, and when she asked for proof that night, Charlie gave her the best sex she&#39;d ever had since their third date. Her pleasure had been his priority that night - and they&#39;d since worked out a bit of an agreement. On his days off, he&#39;d treat her as best he could - and give her better if possible than he gave his clients.<br />
<br />
When she&#39;d asked once if he was queer, Charlie had just cupped his chin, admitted he didn&#39;t know, but just went with whatever felt best by the moment. &quot;And having sex with you, babe, ALWAYS feels amazing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before long Charlie saw the telltale sign of the sun well and truly going down as he drove. The big city&#39;s tallest skyscrapers both intimidated and put Charlie at awe. This was a place of both some of the biggest people in California, and some of the smallest. The night slipped over the tall buildings and darkened the alleyways and streets, lamplights and street signs illuminating the Castro and setting the scene for the night life.<br />
<br />
By the time Charlie arrived at the Bridge Scarlet, he made sure everything was in order. He entered through a side entrance, instead of the front door, which even now was packed with clientele eager to see the night&#39;s theme. Most were men, and he could recognize repeat customers. As he entered the private room for the boys, he was greeted with claps on the shoulders and slaps on his ass, chuckling and occasionally letting out a coy little moan at the slaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Hollywood, how&#39;s life treating ya?&quot; Applying some cream to his face was Daniel Montoya, a handsome, well muscled Latino, black hair slicked back - dressed as most were in the night&#39;s theme. Charlie knew Daniel well enough to know getting his body as hairless as it was was a battle and a half.<br />
<br />
&quot;Real nice,&quot; Charlie said as he stashed his lunch at the side of the room - same place a lot of the guys kept theirs. Stripping was a pretty long job, and he made sure to keep just enough of a snack to keep him on his feet, but not so much to make himself seem bloated. &quot;My girlfriend and I are gonna be hitting up Roderigo&#39;s this week for a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, Charlie, with how much you love grinding on guys,&quot; Daniel teased him, &quot;I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re one of the ones with a girlfriend.&quot; Daniel was...gay? Or so he said. Honestly, whatever he &quot;was&quot;, was Daniel&#39;s business at this point. He said the girl in his photos on IG was his Beard. A Beard he&#39;d had for going on a year and a half now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love that place, Roderigo&#39;s is the best Italian I&#39;ve had in a long time!&quot; Terry was the youngest of the strippers at about twenty one. He was still in college, and put his wages toward helping his education. He had a look of faux-innocence to him, which appealed to clientele who wanted an ur-Twink. His curly brown locks and bright blue eyes accentuated his charm. Despite his soft and nonthreatening looks, apparently the body he had was not just well muscled for show. He&#39;d learned Judo at some point, and as one particularly pushy client learned, just because Terry looked the part of a Twink didn&#39;t mean he was completely helpless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always tell my girl about you, Terr, she&#39;d love to meet you sometime.&quot; His girlfriend hadn&#39;t had much interest in meeting anyone from work except Terry. Supposedly, she knew his boyfriend from work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright everybody, get ready, we got a pretty full house tonight, and that means a lot of work!&quot; Greg Montero shouted into the room. The older - as in in his mid-thirties - man used to work as a stripper here back in the day. But now he just wore a skimpy, super tight dress shirt and business pants while he served as a go-between talking with David Waters, the boss of the place. Charlie respected the old pro, and hoped he&#39;d get to go back on the floor sometime. After all, Greg was still a sexy, sexy man. It was just apparently he and his wife had just gotten engaged.<br />
<br />
Before long, Charlie, Daniel, Terry and a bunch of the other strippers headed out in tune with the emission of steam from the stage - the best to accentuate the outfits for the night. Nearly instantaneously, Charlie felt that endorphin rush as he heard people whistling and catcalling him. Tossing money his way and shouting their desires his way. &quot;You want me to pop another button!?&quot; Charlie shouted to the crowd, and got a number of bills as a response.<br />
<br />
Another button opened, and Charlie shouted, &quot;Naughty naughty boys and---are there gals? I might have to arrest you~!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dancing got hot and heavy, the stage was basically designed to introduce a light bit of heat to give that glistening look to the performers. Charlie could hear Daniel going off stage to give a lap dance to a hairy, well muscled young gentleman in a letterman and jeans - looked like one of the local jocks from a college was probably giving it the college try!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir! Sir! Kiss me sir, please---!!&quot; A young, geeky guy who looked just plain desperate waved around---wow! Wow! <br />
<br />
A hundred dollar bill and some twenties. He could really treat Gabby with that. Charlie calmly strode downstage and said, &quot;Forty for a kiss, how about the hundo for something more.&quot; This made the geeky guy blush - and then fervently nod. The client was not a usual, probably in town for a tech job or something. He had ginger hair, brown eyes, and a lanky though not entirely untoned body. Probably a gym hobbyist - just enough to keep the fat off while he worked a largely stationary job. The geeky guy was dressed in a green polo shirt, khaki pants, and just looking at him, Charlie could tell the guy was rocking a pretty steady bulge already.<br />
<br />
Charlie moved in, took the forty, and right when he started kissing the guy, something hit him all at once - right in the middle of their tongues swirling together, though the nerd was too distracted by moaning and trying to hold on to Charlie to note the surprised look. His eyes widened and shot open fully in the middle of the kiss. Charlie started to see something. <br />
<br />
He and his girlfriend out on the city of San Fran. She wanted to go shopping or something on her own. Charlie stayed out. He saw something - followed some kind of---of sign. Before long he&#39;d stumbled into the Bridge, and into a world he didn&#39;t understand. He could feel hands on him, delighting him in ways he had never felt before. But also reshaping him, pulling, pushing - he had no idea what was happening. The flashback ended with him standing there as he was now. A sterling example of bodybuilding masculinity, his trunks soiled with an emission, his girlfriend standing next to Mr. Waters...<br />
<br />
&quot;I---uh, hey uh, Hollywood?&quot; The nerd&#39;s uncertain voice totally and completely ended the flashback. As weird as it was. The svelte young man asked, &quot;Can you uh, get me off by a dance on me? I&#39;m like, already super hard.&quot; Charlie held his head for a moment, figuring he could puzzle out whatever the hell that was at a later time. He needed to earn his keep. Moving around to press his ass against the ginger nerd&#39;s crotch, Charlie started giving the guy his usual A+ Lapdance. Guiding the twitching hands of the young man up to Charlie&#39;s broad, powerful lats and chest.<br />
<br />
He kept going even as he felt the nerdy client twitching, shaking and haphazardly thrusting against his ass. Charlie however still thought he had no context for those weird images he saw. The feelings he was only now starting to remember. It was like layers of identity being pulled back and some element of a different one getting to breathe. Charlie&#39;s contemplation was deep enough that he didn&#39;t even really hear the nerd gasp and piston his hips a few more times in quick succession, and grunt out, &quot;I&#39;m cumming! I&#39;m cumming! Fuck I&#39;m cumming!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie got up, saw the stained khakis, and smiled despite the things he was finding himself remembering. &quot;Whew...Whew man, you&#39;re good, Hollywood. Good...so fucking good...&quot; The nerdy guy was breathing harshly. Just laying there for a moment to recharge. As soon as he could though, he handed Charlie the hundred dollar bill, and Charlie returned to the stage to dance more into the night.<br />
<br />
However before long he saw the client he&#39;d just gotten done with getting up in an odd way. He swore he could hear over the music &quot;I uh, I feel kinda funny...excuse me...&quot; As the guy started making his way toward the men&#39;s bathroom. Charlie found himself feeling curious - and thankfully, he&#39;d gotten enough done lately to get in a break - his legs feeling like they very well deserved one. Quickly darting off the stage, Charlie wiped his forehead. As another dancer went up there, Charlie found himself walking toward the bathroom amidst all the hectic energy of the night.<br />
<br />
As the brown haired performer walked into the bathroom, he swore he could hear someone moaning. And he could see the nerdy guy poised over one of the sinks, sweating up a storm. And yet it looked like something wasn&#39;t exactly the same...</p>
