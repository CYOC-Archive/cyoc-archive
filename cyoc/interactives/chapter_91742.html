(forgot to put in last chapter that Sam was seventeen)<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam woke up and put on his clothes ready for the day ahead. He couldn&#39;t wait to try out all the activities at the camp. He ran down the stairs of the house they had rented for the week to find his aunt Jane in the kitchen. He was ashamed to admit it but he had always been attracted to Jane. What with her light brown hair, green eyes and plump lips. Her body wasn&#39;t half bad either. She was very slim for sure but she had all the right curves like her small b cup breasts and the slight curve to her waist. She wasn&#39;t the typical woman a boy would be attracted to but, Sam wasn&#39;t the typical kind of boy. The age difference was a problem though. As well as the inevitability that it would be incest. She was twenty seven and he was only fourteen.<br />
<br />
She noticed him, gave him a bowl of cereal and continued on working in the kitchen. Then Greg and Michael came down the stairs and also received a bowl of cereal. Sam was six years older than both of them but over the year that he had lived with them he had bonded with them quite a bit. They continued on eating their cereal and Sam had just finished when Jessica came down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Although Sam had bonded with both Greg and Michael, he had never gotten on with Jessica. She assumed she just didn&#39;t like him. And there was very little that they could bond over considering she was only six years old. And as she was the youngest Jane took care of her the most. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sam, sweetie. If you&#39;ve finished with your cereal can you go and take a shower and get changed. I put your clothes on the bed,&quot; said Jane.<br />
<br />
That was one of the few things Sam hated about Jane, she treated him like he was eight years old. He assumed it was because she wanted to treat him exactly the same as Greg and Michael but it just annoyed him. He did everything she told him to do anyway though. Only because she had good intentions and would punish him like an eight year old as well. And that would probably mean a spanking or a stern talking to as she put it.<br />
<br />
After he had gotten changed Sam went downstairs to wait in the living room with Jane. They started talking as Jane told him what they would be doing for the day. She said they would go for a picnic and then check out some of the activities at the center. It didn&#39;t sound to bad. Sam didn&#39;t say anything anyway he just listened. <br />
<br />
When everyone was downstairs and ready they went out to the car Sam tried to sit up front but Jane told him that it was Jessica&#39;s turn. So Sam sat in the back with Greg and Michael not wanting to argue.<br />
 When they got to the park Greg and Michael immediately bolted over to a group of kids who were playing and joined them. Aunt Jane, Jessica, and Sam went over to a tree and set up the blanket. Aunt Jane told Sam that he should go and play with his brothers, So he did. He played some games with the group of kids for about 2 hours. then aunt jane called them over and gave them each a sandwich. Sam had a ham and cheese sandwich.<br />
<br />
Sam felt like he had to go pee badly after he was done eating. Well he had to go when he was playing but kind of got caught up in the game of tag we was having. He got up and started to head to the bathroom when Jane stopped him and asked him where he was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to the bathroom,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;sweetie, you&#39;re in an area you don&#39;t know, with people you don&#39;t know. You&#39;re far too young to go to the bathroom by yourself. Just let me finish with my sandwich and all five of us can go,&quot; Jane replied in her typical loving tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I cant hold it for much longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t hold it any longer and just let go wetting his pants. Jane immediately noticed and said that she didn&#39;t bring him a change of clothes so they would have to go back to the house before they went to the activity centre.<br />
<br />
They went home and Jane went upstairs telling Sam to wait in the kitchen for her. When she got back she had a towel with her and she unbuttoned his pants and pulled them down in the middle of the kitchen. She told him that as punishment for wetting his pants that he would have to wear a pull up for the rest of the afternoon.<br />
<br />
She took him upstairs and into her bedroom and pulled a pull-up out of Greg and Michaels suitcase. <br />
<br />
&quot;Since you&#39;re quite small for your age I&#39;m sure this will fit you,&quot; she said. Sam said nothing as he stepped into the pull-up and let Jane pull it up for him. She then gave him a pair of shorts to put on. And told him to wait downstairs as she got everyone else ready.<br />
<br />
They got in the car again, with Sam sat in the back again as it still wasn&#39;t his turn to go in the front. They got to the activity center and walked in. Jane said that they could each choose one thing to do as an activity. Greg and Michael wanted to do archery, Sam thought he might as well do archery too. So he said he would like to do archery as well. <br />
<br />
Jane sat down with Jessica on a bench behind the three of them as they did archery. Sam was sure that he was going to beat the two of them put together. Where as Greg and Michael thought otherwise. <br />
<br />
First shot, Sam misses, Greg hits the second ring and Michael hit the center. This continued for all five shots they had. Sam only hit the target once where as Greg and Michael got three bullseyes&#39; between them. After that Sam was feeling quite down and so didn&#39;t say anything as he watched Jessica do her activity.<br />
<br />
They got home and Sam was still feeling quite down. Jane had him sit on the couch in just his pull-up on top of a towel. She didn&#39;t want me ruining the couch incase he wet himself again. He sat for hours watching TV in just his pull-up and actually did wet himself again, without him noticing<br />
<br />
. When it was time for bed aunt Jane took him upstairs and told him to lie on the bed. He had a bad rash from wearing the wet underwear for so long so she peeled them off him and told him to just lay there. She left the room and returned a few minutes later. She took some cream and rubbed his privates down saying she would put him in diapers if it happened again. when she was done she went over to the dresser and took out a pair of goodnite bed wetting pants. They looked like underwear, but much thicker and made out of a cloth like material. she had him stand up as she slipped his legs into them and pulled them firmly up to his waist. She kissed him on the forehead as she tucked him in and said &quot;Goodnight, little one.&quot;</p>
