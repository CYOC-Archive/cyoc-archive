<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seven months after Freddy and Michael’s first experience with the Ruggeri ring, the two of them sat around Michael’s father’s bedroom on a quiet Saturday afternoon. Michael had been hesitant about going in his parents bedroom without permission, but Freddy was insistent upon seeing Michael’s baby photos. Knowing where a large box of photos were hidden, Michael took the box out of his parents bedroom closet and sat on the floor to sort out the photos.<br />
<br />
Looking through the old photos, Michael found pictures from when he was an infant, a year, two and three years old. Smiling, Freddy put his hands on Michael’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Awww!” Freddy exclaimed, as he saw a particularly cute photo of Michael as a baby. “You were so adorable!”<br />
<br />
Michael blushed at the compliment, but he also felt uncomfortable with seeing what he looked like as a kid.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I was that particularly cute, to be honest” Michael admitted. <br />
<br />
Freddy shook his head and kissed Michael on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“I disagree” he replied sincerely. “You were an adorable little baby. In fact, I’d say you might have possibly been the cutest baby to ever walk the face of the Earth.”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on, Freddy. That’s not true.”<br />
<br />
“Sure it is. You were so cute, unlike me. I was a really ugly baby growing up.”<br />
<br />
“That’s probably not true, but even still, you grew up into the most handsome man I have ever met.”<br />
<br />
Freddy smiled, as Michael went in for a kiss on the lips. They briefly smooched, before another stack of photos caught his attention.<br />
<br />
“Hey” Freddy said, as he pointed to the pile of photos on the floor. “Those look like your dad’s old wrestling photos.”<br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael replied, as he held up a photo to get a closer look. “I guess you’re right. I don’t think I’ve ever seen these before.”<br />
<br />
Sifting through the various photos, Michael saw his father captured at various points in his wrestling career. He saw his hand held up by referees as the victor in several shots. He saw photos of his father leaning into his rivals, photos of him dominating his opponents and photos of him standing around in a tight, blue singlet. <br />
<br />
“Phew” Freddy whistled, as he looked through the photos of his boyfriend’s father in his wrestling heyday. “Your dad was a total stud.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael reprimanded, as he smacked him on the shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Ouch! Why’d you hit me like that for? You should see it as a compliment.”<br />
<br />
“It’s my dad you’re talking about. Don’t say stuff like that. It gives me the creeps.”<br />
<br />
“Well, think of it this way.”<br />
<br />
Freddy leaned in and kissed Michael on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“If it wasn’t for your dad” he continued “then you wouldn’t be here.”<br />
<br />
Michael began to frown, as he remembered what his father had told him months earlier.<br />
<br />
“Not like that” Freddy corrected himself. “I meant like he made you possible, with his…well, you know.”<br />
<br />
“I know, Freddy” Michael replied nervously. “Can we stop talking about my dad like that now, please? I’m really getting uncomfortable here.”<br />
<br />
Freddy shrugged his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“Suit yourself” he replied nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
In that moment, Freddy noticed a wrestling photo of his boyfriend’s father that caught his attention. <br />
<br />
“Hey” Freddy said, as he went to pick up the photo from the floor. “I never knew your dad ever grew out his beard before.”<br />
<br />
Freddy stared at a photo of Michael’s father, standing near his wife, who held a little, baby Michael in her hands. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t know that either, actually” Michael replied, as he took the photo from Freddy’s hands and studied it closely. “It didn’t look particularly good on him, though.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t share your sentiment on that” Freddy replied, as he took back the photo. “I think the beard made him look really sexy.”<br />
<br />
“Ick, no. It made him look like a hairy gorilla. It’s bad enough he sheds his body hair all over the house. The beard just makes him look like he belongs in a zoo.”<br />
<br />
“What are you boys doing in my room?!” a voice called out to them.<br />
<br />
Michael yelped and Freddy dropped the photo on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hi Mr. Scavolini” Freddy answered calmly, as Michael’s father walked over to where they were sitting.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing in my room?” Michael’s father asked again, with a stern tone in his voice. <br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael stuttered out, at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
“We were just looking for baby photos of Michael” Freddy replied confidently “and Michael told me they were in your closet. I hope you don’t mind that we were taking them out to look at them.”<br />
<br />
“Eh” Michael’s father replied, starting to calm down. “I guess that’s an acceptable enough story, seeing as you made a big mess on my bedroom floor. I was just worried you were going around snooping for things that aren’t meant for your eyes to see.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father squatted down and sat next to Michael on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Oh my goodness!” he exclaimed, as he held up a baby picture of Michael. “You were the cutest baby I have ever seen in my entire life.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father gave his son a big, wet kiss on the cheek, causing Michael to squirm in response. <br />
<br />
“I said that to Michael too when I saw the baby photos” Freddy replied happily. “I’ve never seen a baby quite as cute as he was.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t that cute” Michael said earnestly. <br />
<br />
“Oh, stop being so humble about it” Michael’s father replied dismissively. “You were adorable. Your mother and I saw you as our precious little angel.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father planted another wet kiss on his cheek.<br />
<br />
“Say, Mr. Scavolini” Freddy said. “I never knew you grew out your beard before.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father chuckled, as he saw the photos of him with his beard grown out on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Yeah” he replied, as he held up a photo of his bearded self, holding a baby Michael in his arms. “That was a little less than a year after Michael was born. I grew out it because I wanted to appear more adult than I was at the time. I was only about 20, so I wanted to look like it was appropriate for me to be a new father. Most people would think I was at least 30, if I hadn’t been wearing my university singlet or attending classes. I didn’t get carded at the bars the entire time I had it. It was weird when I finally did get carded after I shaved it off, though.”<br />
<br />
“I think it looked pretty great on you” Freddy admitted. <br />
<br />
“You think so?”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father scratched his chin, as Michael looked at him with an annoyed expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“I don’t” Michael replied with an irritated tone in his voice. “I think it made you look like a hairy ape.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father laughed out loud, as he banged his chest and ooped like a gorilla. This caused Freddy to laugh along and Michael to snort out in disapproval. Michael’s father rubbed his son’s hair, before he continued to speak.<br />
<br />
“Your mother said the exact same thing. She hated the beard when I grew it out and kept begging me for months to shave it.”<br />
<br />
“I guess you didn’t really seem to like it that much either, Michael” Freddy commented, as a photo of Michael crying as an infant was in his line of vision.<br />
<br />
“Heh” Michael’s father chuckled, as he stared at the photo in question.<br />
<br />
It was a picture of his bearded self trying to comfort his crying son. <br />
<br />
“I guess you weren’t ever really a fan of it, were you Michael?” his father remarked.<br />
<br />
“No” Michael groaned out in reply. <br />
<br />
“Well, I didn’t get to keep it for too long. Only for that semester, maybe a little bit after that. By the following semester, your mother insisted that I had to shave it off. I do what I have to to please your mother, Michael. So, I got rid of it. It’s amazing I got to keep it for as long as I did, in hindsight.”<br />
<br />
“You know” Freddy remarked “you should consider letting it grow out again sometime.”<br />
<br />
“You think so?” Michael’s father asked, as he scratched his chin. “The boys at work say the exact same thing. They think it’d make me look like a big tough guy. One that none of the other crew members would want to fuck with.”<br />
<br />
“No, dad” Michael replied. “I hate your beard and mom would kill you if you didn’t shave.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe I can talk to her and see if she’ll let me try to grow it out for a month or so.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father continued to scratch his face, before he got up from the floor.<br />
<br />
“Clean up the mess on the floor, Michael” he ordered. “Take any photos of yourself that you want to your room and leave the rest of the photos in the box.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, dad” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“See you later, Mr. Scavolini” Freddy said.<br />
<br />
Michael’s father nodded, as he left his bedroom. Carefully sorting through the photos, Michael took the baby photos he wanted and put the rest of them away. Before he finished cleaning up, Freddy snuck a photo of Michael’s father with a beard into his pocket. When he was done, Michael stood up with the box of photos and placed it back into the closet. <br />
<br />
A month later, Freddy and Michael sat in Michael’s bedroom doing their homework. They tried to focus on their studies, but an underlying tension filled the air. After a time, Freddy sighed, as he closed his textbook and looked up at Michael with a serious expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“Michael” he said. “We have to talk.”<br />
<br />
Michael ignored him, as he continued to write down his homework. <br />
<br />
“Michael” he repeated again.<br />
<br />
Michael continued to ignore him.<br />
<br />
“Michael.”<br />
<br />
“What, Freddy?” Michael snapped. <br />
<br />
“We have to talk.”<br />
<br />
“I’m in the middle of my homework right now. Can’t it wait?”<br />
<br />
“No. We need to talk about this right now.”<br />
<br />
Michael put down his homework and pen and gave Freddy a stern look.<br />
<br />
“This better be important enough for you to interrupt my homework that’s due tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“We have to talk about what you’re going to do about the fall.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
This was around the time when Michael had found out about his acceptance to Harvard. He was one of the last students to gain admission. His best friend, Diya, had learned months earlier via early admission that she was accepted to the university. She was going to enroll that fall on a fully paid scholarship. She had hoped that Michael would be able join her there, but up until this point, it didn’t seem like that was going to happen. Finally, at the final hour, Michael got news of his acceptance to the prestigious institution. <br />
<br />
“You know what I’m talking about” Freddy answered. “You know, about Harvard.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh” Michael grunted in response. <br />
<br />
While Michael was fully prepared to enroll at Sacramento university on a full paid scholarship that fall, this last minute acceptance to Harvard had changed the calculation for him. Michael’s father, seeing it as the opportunity to live vicariously through his son, was ramping up a lot of pressure for him to enroll there that fall.<br />
<br />
“It’s a game changer” his father would say. “It could change your whole life. Who knows who you’ll meet while you’re a student there. A future president. Future captains of industry. Future CEO’s of the biggest corporations in America. The amount of networking will be life changing for you. When you graduate, the world will open up its doors to you. The world will become your oyster.”<br />
<br />
Michael wasn’t as sold on the idea of going there. He was running out of time, however, as a decision needed to be made in just a few days time. It was causing tensions in his house, not just because of the immense loans his father would have to take out for Michael to enroll there, but for how many years he’d have to live apart from Freddy.<br />
<br />
“You’ll see him on break” Michael’s father insisted. “And on holidays too.”<br />
<br />
Freddy and Michael had dreamed of moving out together when they graduated high school. Freddy had already purchased a place with Michael in Sacramento. Although the deed was in Freddy’s name for now, being as he had already turned 18 when they purchased it and Michael wouldn’t become a legal adult until that August, the plan was for them to move in together and live under the same roof while working on getting their degrees. Those plans were being tested by Michael’s father and his desire for his son to become a Harvard graduate. <br />
<br />
“I’m having a hard time saying no to him, Freddy” Michael responded.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been having panic attacks at night about this, Michael” Freddy responded. “Our relationship is only a few years old now. Making it a long distance one during college may destroy it permanently. Living on opposite coasts could see us splitting up and moving on to seeing other people.”<br />
<br />
“That’s part of what I’m afraid of, but I’m also afraid of my dad.”<br />
<br />
“Didn’t you say Sacramento would pay your schooling in full?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but not for my cost of living expenses. My father has already said that if I turn down Harvard, that he’s going to throw me out of the house.”<br />
<br />
“Is he fucking serious? Oh my God.”<br />
<br />
“He kind of has a point about it though, Freddy. Harvard could be a game changer for me. For us.”<br />
<br />
“How? Seeing our relationship end? That’s exactly what your father wants.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not true. He’s been working with a therapist for eight months now trying to deal with his feelings about us and our relationship. I don’t think his desire for me to go to Harvard is part of some elaborate plot to break us up.”<br />
<br />
Just as Michael expressed this thought, a knock could be heard on the door.<br />
<br />
“What did I tell you about having your door locked in my house while Freddy is over? Michael’s father asked him gruffly from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, dad” Michael responded nervously, as he went to unlock and open his bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Michael’s father stood before them in the hall, with a frown on his face. There was also something else that was notable about him as well. In the month since Michael had found the wrestling photos in the box in his parent’s closet, Michael’s father had decided to grow out his beard. His facial hair grew quickly, so by this time, it was already full and dense, covering his entire face in a mask of black fur.<br />
<br />
Seeing Michael’s father bearded made Freddy’s heart beat quickly. He took in the sight of the man whose sperm gave his boyfriend life on this Earth. Although he had promised to work on his ogling and staring, in this moment, Freddy took those attempts and threw them out the window. He was incredibly turned on in this moment. His heart began to race fast and he could feel a stirring in his loins.<br />
<br />
“Michael” his father said gruffly. “I don’t want to have to keep telling you this over and over again.”<br />
<br />
“I’m really sorry, dad” Michael replied sincerely. “It was an accident. I swear.”<br />
<br />
“You weren’t doing anything you weren’t supposed to be doing in here, were you?”<br />
<br />
“No, absolutely not. We were just doing our homework. The locked door was an oversight.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy?”<br />
<br />
Freddy continued to stare at Michael’s father, seeing some saliva drip out from his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Freddy!” Michael’s father snapped.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Freddy replied, as he snapped out of his trance. <br />
<br />
“Freddy. What were you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Uh.”<br />
<br />
Freddy blushed, as he looked down his lap. A tent began to form in his pants, which he tried to ignore as best as he could.<br />
<br />
“He was just doing his homework” Michael replied, trying to ease the tense situation.<br />
<br />
“Freddy?” Michael’s father asked again.<br />
<br />
Looking up at Michael’s father, Freddy cheeks were flushed in a rosy red color. He was incredibly embarrassed, trying to find a way to avoid this uncomfortable conversation.<br />
<br />
“Hi Mr Scavolini” Freddy finally eked out.<br />
<br />
“Were you doing anything with my son just now?”<br />
<br />
“No, sir. We were just doing our homework.”<br />
<br />
“So then why are you all flustered?”<br />
<br />
Freddy stuttered, while Michael looked over at his boyfriend, embarrassed in this moment. He knew why Freddy was stuttering, but he didn’t want to tell his father the real reason why. It was too humiliating for him to say it aloud. He could tell what it was from Freddy’s behavior. He didn’t have to say a word. He just hoped his father would figure it out on his own. <br />
<br />
“Michael” his father said. “What did I tell you about hooking up in my house?”<br />
<br />
“We—“ Michael tried to reply.<br />
<br />
“We didn’t hook up, Mr. Scavolini” Freddy sheepishly replied in Michael&#39;s place. “Uh…”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father stared at Freddy with a confused expression on his face. He turned to look at Michael, who also began feel his face blush. After taking a moment to process the situation, it dawned on him what was really going on.<br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael’s father blurted out, as he scratched at his black beard. “You were…”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father continued to look at Freddy, who nodded his head in agreement, ashamed at how he was feeling in that moment. <br />
<br />
“Ah, gotcha. Yeah, you don’t need to elaborate on that any further. I know what’s up.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a very nice beard, Mr. Scavolini” Freddy quietly said in response. <br />
<br />
“Thank you Freddy. Yeah, I thought about what you had said to me when you were over here that time looking at the photos in my bedroom. I really liked how I looked with a beard and thought I should try growing it out again. I’m happy to say that there’s hardly any gray hairs in it. It’s almost as black as it was when I grew it out that first time all those years ago.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father continued to scratch at his beard as he spoke. <br />
<br />
“It grows out faster and thicker than it did years ago. This growth right here would have taken me three months to get when I was the age I was in those photos. It’s like all the extra testosterone I have developed from growing up and working out has made me hairier than ever.”<br />
<br />
Freddy licked his lips, as Michael groaned out. <br />
<br />
“Of course” Michael’s father continued “my wife and your boyfriend hate it, Freddy. I’m probably going to need to shave this thing soon.”<br />
<br />
“It’s obvious why” Michael remarked. “You look like a hairy ape and you smell like one too.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father beat his chest and jumped up and down on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Listen, Michael” his father replied. “You’re lucky I don’t throw my feces all over the place.”<br />
<br />
“Ewww, dad!” Michael exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Freddy let out a little chuckle. <br />
<br />
“See” Michael’s father noted with a chuckle. “Your boyfriend gets it. He at least has a sense of humor about it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad I could make you laugh” Freddy replied. “I just don’t want to make things awkward, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
The room fell silent, as Michael slapped his forehead. <br />
<br />
“Well” Michael’s father replied “I’ve been trying to make the best of it, that’s all. I know you’ve been trying to get your staring under control and I really appreciate it, Freddy. I know it’s gotta be tough for you with my beard and all, but it won’t be on my face for much longer. So, enjoy it while you can, I guess.”<br />
<br />
Freddy gulped, which caused Michael to put his hands on Freddy’s lap.<br />
<br />
“Dad” Michael said. “We’d like to talk to you about something.”<br />
<br />
“Uh” his father replied nervously. “Sure Michael. What is it?”<br />
<br />
“Would you mind sitting down?”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father nodded, as he entered his son’s bedroom. Sitting down on the bed next to Michael, Freddy rolled the rolling chair over to face Michael and his father directly.<br />
<br />
“Freddy can sit next to you while I’m here” Michael’s father said, as he motioned him to the bed. <br />
<br />
Freddy nervously got up from the chair and sat next to Michael on the bed.<br />
<br />
“If I’m in the room” his father continued “I know you’re not going to do any funny business, so it’s ok.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded, before Michael spoke up.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been thinking about the Harvard thing&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
“Michael” his father replied “you know what I think about this. Unless your answer is yes, then I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”<br />
<br />
“But what about Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“Listen.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father put his hand on his son’s lap, looking at Freddy and then back at his son.<br />
<br />
“Listen” he repeated again. “I get it. I get that you’re afraid of being apart from Freddy for all that period of time. However, you’ve gotta understand something here. You’re on the precipice of a potentially life changing opportunity. I don’t want to see you throw it all away because of your high school sweetheart.”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Freddy exclaimed, insulted by this remark. <br />
<br />
“Dad” Michael replied “Freddy is more than just my high school sweetheart. He’s the love of my life and I can’t imagine spending four years apart from him like that.”<br />
<br />
“Look, Michael” his father replied. “You’re young. Freddy’s your first boyfriend. You haven’t even gotten a chance to know anyone else. You shouldn’t just go with the first person you meet.”<br />
<br />
“I resent that!” Freddy said angrily. “I’m not just some person. I’m Michael’s boyfriend, and a very good one at that, if I might say so myself.”<br />
<br />
Freddy gripped onto Michael’s hand tightly.<br />
<br />
“Well, how would you know if your love is that strong unless you try experimenting a bit?” Michael’s father asked.<br />
<br />
“You didn’t” Michael hissed out in reply.<br />
<br />
“That’s different.”<br />
<br />
“How so?”<br />
<br />
“Because it’s your mother and I loved her very much.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I love Freddy too, the way you loved mom.”<br />
<br />
“And I love Michael” Freddy added. <br />
<br />
The two of them continued to grip on to each other’s hands tightly.<br />
<br />
“I’m just saying that maybe you should consider following the old adage” Michael’s father suggested. “If you love someone, let them go. If they come back, they are yours. You two are your first boyfriends. Maybe in college you’ll find someone you’re more compatible with. Maybe you’ll even find you like girls instead of boys, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!” Michael exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Freddy gulped nervously at this comment. He had remembered that he had gotten an erection for Sofya months earlier. He had also mated with two female bitches in heat as Fido; their neighbor’s dog Ellie, who had given birth to a litter of mixed Australian/German Shepherd puppies, and the stray Black Labrador in the park, the mother of his dog, Shadow. Although it could have been explained away as the dog’s sexuality and not his own, Freddy had wondered if that was really the case. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to upset Michael in that moment with doubts about his gayness, Freddy sat silently, continuing to hold on to his boyfriend&#39;s hand, keeping his mouth firmly shut. <br />
<br />
“Have you ever tried having sex with a woman before?” Michael’s father asked his son.<br />
<br />
“No!” Michael answered incredulously. “Why would I?”<br />
<br />
“How would you know don’t like it if you’ve never tried it?”<br />
<br />
“How you would you know if you’re totally straight if you’ve never tried hooking up with a guy, dad?”<br />
<br />
“Because I don’t like guys.”<br />
<br />
“And I don’t like girls.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sat silently, as Michael and his father continued to argue. <br />
<br />
“Don’t knock it till you try it, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“I could say the same thing to you, dad.”<br />
<br />
“I’m married to your mother, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“So? What’s your point?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to even entertain the idea of cheating on your mother, Michael. Especially not with a man.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not suggesting that you do. Why don’t you try watching gay porn sometime?”<br />
<br />
“Why would I do that?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, dad. It’s what you said yourself. Don’t knock it till you try it.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father sat silently, as his son stared him with an extreme rage visible in his face. Freddy sat quietly next to him, looking nervous and concerned for his boyfriend’s well being. Sighing, Michael’s father got up and headed out of his son’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
“We’ll talk about this later” he said. “I don’t think I can talk about this calmly or rationally right now.”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a frustrated grunt, as his father left to go into his own bedroom. Seeing his boyfriend visibly angry and upset, Freddy gave him a hug and they embraced for several minutes. The two of them agreed to continue their homework, saving a conversation about their future for another time. <br />
<br />
Another hour passed before Michael’s father called to them again.<br />
<br />
“Michael!” he yelled out. “Freddy!”<br />
<br />
“What is it, dad?!” Michael called out in response.<br />
<br />
“Come in here, please!”<br />
<br />
“We’re doing our homework!”<br />
<br />
“Just come in here! You won’t regret it!”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Michael got up and motioned Freddy to follow him. Nervously, they made their way to his parents bedroom. Seeing that the door was closed, Michael knocked on it a few times.<br />
<br />
“Come in!” Michael’s father replied.<br />
<br />
When Michael opened the door, he and Freddy got the shock of their lives. Sitting on the bed, sprawled out as naked as the day he was born, was Michael’s father. His beard wasn’t the only notably hairy thing about him. His chest was covered in thick, black fur. It spread up his shoulder and down to his belly. His pubic hair was massive. His arms and legs were covered in a coat of black hair. Michael’s father was a bear, no doubt about it.<br />
<br />
Michael and Freddy reacted differently to seeing Ralph Scavolini butt naked on his bed. Michael covered his eyes and let out an audible shriek. He was extremely embarrassed to see his father in this state. It was bad enough that this was his father, with the idea of incest repulsing him immensely. It was even worse how hairy he was. It covered his entire body in a thick, black coat of hair. He hated hairy guys, thinking they looked grungy and smelled really badly. Mostly, they reminded him too much of his father, for whom his relationship was still on the rocks. <br />
<br />
Freddy, on the other hand, let out a surprised gasp. He was immediately turned on in that moment and felt his penis shifting in his pants. The black hair on his boyfriend’s father turned him on immensely. He had seen him shirtless before and admired the amount of hair that he had. However, he had never seen his penis, which was slightly small, but extremely thick. He licked his lips, as he took in the beautiful sight before him. This was like the beginning of a great sex dream.<br />
<br />
“Michael” his father called out. “Move your arm away.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh” he responded. “No way. Dad, why did you call us in to your room? And why are you butt naked on the bed like that?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, I thought you liked guys.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but not my own dad. I like guys my own age.”<br />
<br />
“Wow” Freddy said, as he drooled out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
“So” Michael’s father continued “I have a proposition for you guys.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” Michael asked incredulously. <br />
<br />
“I know you guys are worried about being apart for a long time and I’ve been feeling a bit curious about things lately. I wanted to offer you guys a spot on my bed to jerk off with me to some bisexual porn I have.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, dad. No way.”<br />
<br />
“Hey Michael” Freddy replied, as he moved his boyfriend’s arm away from his face. “Let’s hear him out.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, no.”<br />
<br />
“Listen to your boyfriend on this” Michael’s father insisted. “Just hear me out.”<br />
<br />
“This is a really bad idea” Michael insisted. “You’re going to regret this.”<br />
<br />
“Just hear me out, please” his father pleaded. “Then you can say no.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Michael” Freddy said encouragingly. “Let’s hear out what he has to say.”<br />
<br />
Michael grunted loudly, before letting out a sigh.<br />
<br />
“I know this is a bad idea” he replied. “And I know I’m going to regret this later, as will you, dad.”<br />
<br />
Sighing, Michael held up his hands in resignation. <br />
<br />
“Fine&quot; he relented &quot;let’s hear you out, dad.”<br />
<br />
“Great” his father said happily. “So I was thinking, I really don’t get the opportunity to have much bonding time with you guys. I know the opportunity for that is going to go away soon, regardless of what you decide to do about school in the fall. So I wanted to take the opportunity now to get to know you guys on a more intimate level.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father paused, before he continued speaking. <br />
<br />
“So I was thinking that we could sit on the bed together and jerk off to a movie. We’d put on a good film and just jack our meat together.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God” Michael groaned. <br />
<br />
“Hey, it’s not something you and Freddy haven’t done before, I’m sure.”<br />
<br />
Freddy blushed, before he made a confession.<br />
<br />
“I’ve done it with some other friends from school.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh” Michael grunted. “Are you serious, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“It’s perfectly normal” his father replied. “Guys jerk off in front of each other all the time.”<br />
<br />
“Did you?”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father paused for a moment, before he answered truthfully. <br />
<br />
“Uh, no. I didn’t. I hooked up with women in high school and then have been with your mother ever since.”<br />
<br />
“So then what do you know about guys jerking off with each other?”<br />
<br />
“You’ve never done it?”<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“Not even with Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I’ve done it with Freddy, dad. He’s my boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“So you know what it’s like, then.”<br />
<br />
“But he’s my boyfriend. I’ve never done it with any of the other guy friends I have.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father shrugged his shoulders. <br />
<br />
“It’s up to you what you want to do, Michael. I think it’ll be a good bonding experience for us and the only time I’m ok with you guys messing around with each other in my house. After this, the rules will resume in force.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nudged Michael, as he walked over to the bed. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Michael” Freddy said, as he took off his shirt. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know” Michael replied nervously. “I don’t think this is a good idea.”<br />
<br />
Both Michael’s father and Freddy patted a spot on the bed. <br />
<br />
“Come on son” his father said. <br />
<br />
“Join us” Freddy added, as he undid his pants and pulled them off to throw on the floor.<br />
<br />
Michael stood nervously, watching Freddy strip off his underwear. Sighing, with an overwhelming sense of fear consuming him, he slowly got himself on the bed. <br />
<br />
“Sit next to me” his father said, as he patted a spot next to him on the bed. <br />
<br />
“I’d rather not” Michael replied, as he scooted next to Freddy.<br />
<br />
“Suit yourself.”<br />
<br />
Slowly, Michael took off his shirt, as he watched his father and Freddy rub their penises. While Freddy was smooth with an athletic build, his father was a furry animal, with a beefier and slightly pudgy build. <br />
<br />
“What do you want me to put on?” Michael’s father asked, as he turned on the television in his room. <br />
<br />
“I’m flexible” Freddy replied, as he stroked at his meat. <br />
<br />
“Michael? his father asked. “Any preference?”<br />
<br />
“Uh” he replied nervously “something with smooth guys. I don’t like hairy guys.”<br />
<br />
“Hey” his father said. “I’m offended by that. I happen to think my hairy body is very sexy.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father rubbed his hairy chest, which Freddy gawked at while he stroked his meat. <br />
<br />
“Your mother does too, by the way.”<br />
<br />
Michael shivered uncomfortably, as he reluctantly stripped off his pants. His father put on a porn with two smooth, blonde twinks getting it on with a blonde haired woman. <br />
<br />
“This good?” Michael’s father asked. <br />
<br />
“I guess so” Michael replied reluctantly. <br />
<br />
The video played in the background of the two blonde men all over the blonde woman. Michael’s father was turned on, as was Freddy. When Michael took off his underwear, he found that the moment was making him anxious. He was having a hard time getting an erection, something Freddy had soon noticed. <br />
<br />
“Need help with that?” Freddy asked, as he leaned over to Michael.<br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as Freddy straddled him and made out with him on the bed. Feeling a little grossed out by what was happening next to him on his bed, Michael’s father let out a subtle “blech” sound. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to close my eyes now” Michael’s father said “if that’s alright with you guys.”<br />
<br />
Freddy and Michael nodded, as they continued to make out with each other. Michael’s father closed his eyes and did his best to drown out the sounds of his son and his son’s boyfriend kissing. He focused on the sounds coming from the porno, which were building a fantasy that was enveloping his mind as he stroked. <br />
<br />
With Michael’s father lost in his own head, Michael was finally able to relax. Slowly, he felt his erection grow, rubbing itself up against his boyfriend’s dick. <br />
<br />
“See?” Freddy commented, as he looked down at his boyfriend’s growing erection. “I knew you could do it.”<br />
<br />
Freddy stood up and leaned himself into Michael’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“I’m horny as a sailor right now. Can my favorite man in the world let my sword rest in his oral cave?”<br />
<br />
Freddy chucked at his corny request, as he leaned his dick into Michael’s mouth. Feeling horny for the first time during this jerk off session, Michael greedily opened his mouth wide and took Freddy’s dick all the way in.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh!” Freddy moaned, as Michael wrapped his lips around his boyfriend’s dick. “That’s it, Michael. That’s how I like it.”<br />
<br />
“Getting turned on?” Michael’s father asked, as he continued to jerk off with his eyes closed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Ralph” Freddy replied, as he bucked into the man’s son. “Everything is great over here.”<br />
<br />
Freddy rocked back and forth into Michael’s mouth. Wanting to go deeper, he placed his hand on the back of Michael’s head and pushed him fully into his crotch. Freaking out, Michael gagged, as he felt Freddy’s pubic hair resting on his face. <br />
<br />
“Is everything alright over there?&quot; Michael’s father asked, still keeping his eyes clothes, as he stroked his meat. <br />
<br />
“Yup” Freddy replied, as he pulled Michael’s head back to allow him some room to breathe. “Everything is good over here.”<br />
<br />
The porno got to an oral scene, where a blonde twink and the blonde woman licked the other blonde twink’s dick. Loud moaning could be heard from the man on the screen, while Freddy pulled his dick out of Michael’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“Come suck my dick” Freddy commanded to Michael, as he laid down on the bed next to Michael’s father. <br />
<br />
Freddy took Michael’s head and guided it down to his dick. Aggressively, he pushed it down onto his crotch and held his boyfriend’s head tightly with his hand. Michael let out a louder gag, as he drooled all over Freddy’s dick.<br />
<br />
“Oh man!” Freddy moaned out loud. “That feels so good!”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like you’re really getting into this movie” Michael’s father commented, still keeping his eyes closed. <br />
<br />
“Oh you wouldn’t believe it, Ralph!”<br />
<br />
Freddy bobbed Michael’s head up and down on his dick. After a few minutes, he pulled Michael up and kissed him on the lips.<br />
<br />
“Hope I wasn’t too rough on you just now” Freddy sensually whispered into Michael’s ear. <br />
<br />
Michael, with tears in his eyes, shook his head, as wiped the saliva from his mouth. He laid down on the bed and continued to jerk on his dick. Spitting on his hand, Freddy took Michael’s dick in his hand and started to rub it aggressively. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God” Michael moaned, as he squirmed on the bed, lost in the feelings of male ecstasy. “Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re getting into now&quot; Michael&#39;s father commented, closing his eyes tighter than they had been before.<br />
<br />
“You close?” Freddy asked, as he continued to stroke Michael&#39;s dick. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God” was all Michael would say as an answer. <br />
<br />
Michael began to buck into Freddy’s hand that was rubbing his dick faster and faster. After a moment, his own humping got extremely rapid in pace. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God, Freddy!” Michael moaned. “I’m gonna cum! Argh!”<br />
<br />
Michael shot out a big load, up to his stomach and pooling into his pubic hair. <br />
<br />
“Nice” Freddy remarked with a smile, as he got up and got on top of his lover.<br />
<br />
Spitting on his hand, Freddy rubbed his dick and began to pump his meat extremely fast. <br />
<br />
“I’m cumming too!” Freddy moaned quite suddenly. “Oh my God! Argh! Fuck! Fuck!”<br />
<br />
Freddy leaned his dick into Michael’s crotch and shot out his load all over him. His sperm mixed with Michael’s, merging together the way their parents bonded in love. After letting out the last of his seed, Freddy collapsed onto the bed to catch his breath. Panting loudly, he noticed that Michael’s father was approaching his own orgasm.<br />
<br />
During the time that Freddy and Michael had ejaculated, Michael’s father lost himself in his head. Although he could hear the audio of the porn in the background, which drowned out the sounds of Freddy and Michael shooting their loads on each other, all he could think about was his wife, Irene. Even when he masturbated, it was all he could think about. He loved her very much and really didn’t see a need to be turned on by anyone else. <br />
<br />
“Maybe Michael has a point about Freddy after all” his father thought to himself, as he continued to imagine his wife on top of him. <br />
<br />
At a certain point, Michael’s father could feel his orgasm approaching. Seeing Michael’s father breathing faster and the speed of his stroking increasing, Freddy decided to pull a bold move. He knew this might be a mistake, but he wanted to try it out anyway. As Michael’s father panted, lost in the feelings of his own self pleasure, Freddy moved his hand to feel Michael’s father’s beard. He stroked it briefly, before he rested his hand on his boyfriend’s father’s very hairy chest. <br />
<br />
Before Michael’s father reached the point of no return, he could feel a hand rubbing his body hair. When Freddy flicked his nipple with a cold finger, his eyes shot wide open. He looked down at his chest hair in horror, as he saw Freddy&#39;s hand calmly resting there. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” Michael’s father thought to himself, as he felt extremely awkward and freaked out in that moment. <br />
<br />
Before he could push Freddy’s hand away, he let out a loud moan and shot one of the biggest loads in his life. The first shot splattered onto his face and beard. The second shot landed on Freddy’s hand. Freddy yelped, as the hot sensation of cum hit the back of his hand. The rest of the shots landed somewhere between his belly and the big bush that sprouted from his crotch. When it was over, he let out a sigh of relief. <br />
<br />
Freddy took his hand off of Michael’s father’s hairy chest and looked at the cum that had landed on the back of it. Michael’s father looked at Freddy and gasped. Freddy was licking his cum off of the back of his hand. It grossed out Michael&#39;s father immensely. Feeling a sense of remorse about what had just transpired, Michael’s father took some sheets and covered himself up.<br />
<br />
“I think you boys should go now” Michael’s father said, with a sense of fear and anxiety present in his voice. <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to tell me twice” Michael replied, as he got up from the bed, gathered his clothes and quickly made his way out his parents bedroom.<br />
<br />
“You too, Freddy” Michael’s father insisted, holding the sheets tighter to his body.<br />
<br />
Freddy silently sat on the bed, feeling extremely nervous in that moment.<br />
<br />
“That’s an order” Michael’s father growled.<br />
<br />
Nervously, Freddy slowly got up and gathered his clothes. He briefly glanced over at Michael&#39;s father, before he made his way out the bedroom door. When Michael’s father thought Freddy was gone, he got up from the bed and looked himself over. He couldn’t believe that Freddy had done that. Although the orgasm felt awesome, he did not give Freddy permission to touch him in that way. No man had ever touched him in such a sexual way before. He was internally freaking out and wondering if he had just made a big mistake by inviting them into his bed like that. <br />
<br />
“Maybe Michael was right not to want to do this after all” his father thought to himself, as he got up from the bed and used tissues to wipe  his cum off his body. “I’m already starting to regret doing this now. What the hell was I thinking?”<br />
<br />
Seeing the ample load of cum still sticking to his beard and black chest hair, it was obvious what had motivated him to do this just now.<br />
<br />
“Of course&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I let my dick think for me instead of using my head. Agh, come on Ralph. Why would you do such a stupid thing like that? Ugh. I just hope I don’t end up regretting this too much.”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Scavolini?” Freddy called out. <br />
<br />
“Jesus!” Michael’s father exclaimed, feeling incredibly startled. <br />
<br />
He turned himself around and showed his naked backside to Freddy. <br />
<br />
“I thought you had left already, Freddy.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Mr. Scavolini. I just wanted to ask you something.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, I don’t—“<br />
<br />
“I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind me showering with Michael.”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father craned his neck to look back at Freddy staring at him. The boy looked good, Michael’s father had to admit. He had a nice, athletic build. He could see why his son was interested in this boy and why he was resisting him so much when it came to enrolling at Harvard. He believed he’d eventually get Michael to see things his way, but it was obvious what was holding him back from taking the plunge. <br />
<br />
Wanting to try to ease the tensions, knowing his next conversation with Michael was about to get extremely awkward, he sighed, as he relented on his son’s boyfriend’s request.<br />
<br />
“Fine” Michael’s father replied. “You can take a shower with my son. But no funny business, understand me? Only showering and nothing else.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, sir” Freddy replied, as he made his way to the bathroom down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Freddy!&quot; Michael&#39;s father called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mr Scavolini&quot; Freddy replied, as he turned his head to look at him from down the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a one time only thing. You&#39;re not allowed to do it again after this. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded, as he made his way into the bathroom, where Michael was already showering.<br />
<br />
Michael’s father sighed, as he walked to the bathroom in his own bedroom. He was mixed with a lot of emotions in that moment. A part of him felt remorseful for doing this kind of perverted stuff with his son and his son’s boyfriend. A part of him thought Freddy rubbing his nipple led to one of the best orgasms of his entire life. A part of him could see why Michael was so attached to Freddy. He still had his issues to work through in regards to his son being gay. However, he believed that, even if he put his foot down on his son going to Harvard that fall, his son’s relationship with Freddy would somehow survive. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know why I know this” Michael’s father thought to himself, as he prepared to take a shower to clean himself up “but I just have a feeling that boy Freddy is going to be around with us for the long run. I just hope I didn’t permanently damage my relationship with my son by doing what we did just now.”<br />
<br />
