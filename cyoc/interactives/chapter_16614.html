<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a Friday night. A long week had finally come to a close. As soon as Jon walked in his dorm room, he locked the door and crashed on his back. He had four tests that week, two papers to write, one quiz, and two lab assignments which were all due on the same day. Aside from all that, he also had to cover the three toughest chapters of biology, physics, calculus, and astronomy. Boy was he glad the week was over!<br />
<br />
He thought about the weekend ahead of him, and shuddered at the thought of spending both Saturday and Sunday in the library, while working on the assignments for next week. “Let’s not go there” he thought to himself. “It’s Friday night, and I want to do something fun, weird, and unusual.”<br />
<br />
He stood up and walked over to the bathroom, where he carefully studied his reflection in the mirror, which was hanging from the wall and was placed just above the sink. He remembered the day Peter came over and made him bigger. He remembered the feeling of growing. He began to wonder what it would feel like to grow some more?<br />
<br />
“Peter… I wish for you to come here now…” he whispered. Like a genie, the tall, sixteen year-old teen suddenly appeared out of nowhere, standing in the middle of the dorm room. Peter and Jon had made an agreement the previous year that Jon could call on him any time he wanted, and Peter would appear before him, ready to make his wishes come true. Peter loved using his powers to help others, and he treasured the role he played as being Jon’s teenage genie.<br />
<br />
Peter popped up in his dorm room, wearing the usual high tops, basketball jersey, basketball shorts, and a big, orange ball in his hand. The six-foot-three-inches-tall kid loved to play basketball, and he was always wearing his favorite basketball uniform.<br />
<br />
“Hiya Jon! What can I do for you?” the Polish/Canadian teenager asked the college student.<br />
<br />
“Peter… I was thinking…” Jon replied. “I’m just in the mood to grow big… I just want to be outrageously muscular for a couple of days, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” Peter grinned. “How big do you want to be?”<br />
<br />
“Well… How big can you make me?” Jon replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Bigger than you can ever imagine!” Peter laughed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I don’t know about that! I can imagine quite a bit!” Jon warned his younger buddy in reply.<br />
<br />
“Uhmm… Well… How about I grow myself first and you just yell ‘Stop!’ when you see me being as big as you want to become, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Sure! Show me what you got! Give it your all!” Jon laughed.<br />
<br />
“I had better call on my muscle man Allen… Hang on…” Peter said, before closing his eyes. Peter made a silent wish. “Allen is the one who can make my muscles grow…”<br />
<br />
Suddenly Allen appeared standing right next to Jon! The captain of the swim team looked around in confusion, before realizing that Peter had summoned him to appear in the dorm room. He was just wearing shorts and a t-shirt, when he appeared in Jon’s dorm.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Allen wondered out loud, while he was looking around in confusion. “Where are we? What am I doing here?”<br />
<br />
“Hey Allen, this is Jon!” Peter smiled, as he introduced Allen to Jon. “He wants to grow muscular and big, but he wants to see me grow first. The growth should stop when he calls it to stop.”<br />
<br />
“Sure! It’s my pleasure!” Allen cheered. “Hey Jon, watch what I’m gonna do to Peter…”<br />
<br />
First, Allen made Peter’s basketball uniform disappear, leaving him wearing nothing more than a posing bikini, that most bodybuilders like to wear.<br />
<br />
Peter closed his eyes and groaned as he felt his body changing. His calves started to inflate like someone blowing air into a balloon. As they grew thicker, his quads started to widen and thicken as well, while thick ropes of veins started to surface. <br />
<br />
Peter’s flat stomach started to show his abs, as the muscles suddenly began to pop up like tiles rising up over a surface which used to be flat as a board.<br />
<br />
His pecs ballooned as well, slowly pushing his shoulders out further, making his upper body seem wider. Thick lats began to form on his backs, giving him the V-shape as his muscles continued to inflate.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Jon… I’m starting to get kinda big right now…” Peter said, as he began to feel the additional weight.<br />
<br />
“I know! I want to see you grow some more…” Jon grinned. Allen stood next to him. Both guys loved watching Peter’s muscles grow!<br />
<br />
Peter’s arms grew thicker, pushing out further as his biceps, triceps and delts were all fighting for space. The large spheres of muscles just pushed his arms our further, making it almost impossible for him to let his arms hang straight down from his side.<br />
<br />
His pectorals were now almost the size of bowling balls, and his quads were like giant pillars of a building. His calves looked like soccer balls, sticking out of the back of his legs.<br />
<br />
“Ummm Jon… I’m starting to get really big now…” Peter murmured to Jon.<br />
<br />
“Grow a little more, Peter” he replied. “Just a little more…”<br />
<br />
Peter’s pecs were now like beach balls! His shoulders were huge, and his body had become twice as wide. He constantly had to change his stance, since his thick legs were pushing against each other, forcing him to spread them out more every other minute or so.<br />
<br />
“Jon!” Peter shouted. “I’m… really… big… now!!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, Peter! Stop!” Jon shouted.<br />
<br />
The muscle growth stopped. Peter let out a sigh of relief, because his growth began to feel uncomfortable. He struggled to walk his first steps, since he had to get accustomed to his incredible weight gain. As he slowly turned around, his jaw dropped wide open as he noted his reflection in the mirror for the very first time.<br />
<br />
“Wow! Is this how big you want to be?” Peter said, as he had to walk through the bathroom door sideways, since his shoulders had made him too wide to even fit through the door opening. He barely squeezed through the door sideways, with the front most side of his passive pectorals rubbing against the door frame.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Let me have it! Make me as big as you are right now!” Jon cheered.<br />
<br />
“Alright! Here goes! Better take your clothes off first…”<br />
<br />
Jon quickly took off his shorts and his shirt. He was only wearing his briefs, when Peter made a silent wish for Jon to grow just as big and just as muscular as he was now.<br />
<br />
Jon groaned as the first wave of incredible muscular growth started to hit him. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” Jon said, as he looked down at his own growing body.<br />
<br />
His arms widened, his shoulders grew, and his legs widened and so did his torso. Massive rows of abdominals popped up on his torso, as his lats grew out from his back, pushing his shoulders out further. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! This is intense!!” Jon said out loud, as he felt his muscles increase in size.<br />
<br />
His arms got bigger, his traps, lats, biceps, delts and triceps all ballooning at the same time, making him hang his arms out further away from his sides. <br />
<br />
“Whaaaaa!!” Jon shouted. He was getting huge!!!<br />
<br />
His pectorals grew into giant spheres of muscle, and deep ropes of veins formed across his legs and his calves.<br />
<br />
“Aaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!!!!” Jon groaned, as he felt every muscle in his body inflate to freakish proportions!<br />
<br />
Within minutes, both Jon and Peter were staring at each other with smiles on their faces.<br />
<br />
Jon had finally stopped growing!<br />
<br />
“Looking great there, Jon!” Peter chuckled, as he stared at his friend with a wide grin. Allen loved the two muscle men the most, since they were both huge now.<br />
<br />
“Holy makeral….” Jon whispered, as he struggled to move his big, heavy body with his massive muscles. He could feel the weight increase and he had to get used to it at first.<br />
<br />
“You two guys are massive!” Allen shouted, as he stood right in between the two muscle men.<br />
<br />
“This is great!” Jon chuckled, as he looked down at his incredibly muscular body. “I’m humongous!”<br />
<br />
Jon just loved it! He raised up his right arm, and flexed. A ball of muscle mass suddenly began to rise up from the top of his forearm until it was the size of a bowling ball! Jon just laughed, as he took note of how massive he had become.<br />
<br />
His shoulders must have made him over four feet wide. He couldn’t walk through the door, and had to turn sideways to get through the doorframe. His neck was thick and round. His legs were as thick as tree stumps. His abdominals looked like individual bricks which were part of a brick wall. His huge pectorals were sticking out in front of his body by over a foot! His biceps were almost 25 inches! <br />
<br />
“Well, Allen, you can shrink me back now! I’m done…” Peter said to his friend. But Allen had other ideas.<br />
<br />
“Not a chance, buddy!” Allen grinned. “I want you to stay that way for the rest of the day!”<br />
<br />
Peter knew that he couldn’t override Allen’s power, and he just shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Well, in that case, I say we go out and stroll around the campus as muscle men…” Peter chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Allen… do you want to grow massive as well?” Jon asked him.<br />
<br />
“No… I just want to walk across campus with you guys for now… I think it’s hot, walking between two giant muscle men…” he replied.<br />
<br />
The three guys then walked across campus, just wearing a pair of shorts and sandals on their feet.<br />
<br />
All the students who walked past them stared at them in disbelief. They were truly the biggest men on campus!<br />
<br />
Peter and Allen stayed with Jon for awhile, until it got past ten at night. Peter then whisked himself and Allen back home, leaving Jon behind on campus. <br />
<br />
Jon walked back to his dorm, and was greeted by his roommate. Nobody could believe how massive he had become! They were truly amazed by his size, his weight, and especially by his incredible strength, which came along with his titanic muscles. Jon just laughed, when all the other guys in the dorm came to visit him in his room, just to check out his new body. Jon had become the biggest and strongest guy in the dorm!<br />
<br />
Life had become a little bit of a struggle at first. Jon couldn’t just fit in a car. He had a hard time getting in the small seats in some of the smaller classrooms, and he ended up sitting on the floor in some classes, just because he was too big and too heavy to sit on any of the small, wooden chairs. Jon was too big for his bed, so he ended up having to sleep on a mattress on the floor. He could no longer sit on the chair at his desk, and he ended up getting a chair which was made of solid steel. It was the only chair he could sit on, because he had become so big and so heavy.<br />
<br />
Jon had gained a tremendous appetite as well, and he felt himself being hungry all day long! His clothes would no longer fit him, but peter took care of that, and he used his power to make all his clothing several sizes bigger so that they could now fit his massive body. <br />
<br />
Jon loved being big. Peter had promised to keep him that way, until he would call on him again. Jon wanted to wait for a few weeks, before calling Peter back for the next change.</p>
