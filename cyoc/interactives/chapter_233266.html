<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer jumped in the car as her mom get in the drivers seat, Jennifer looked around thinking to herself. She had expected the old SUV her mom used to drive before she sold it, but she still had her new sedan, maybe there were still remnants of her old self here. Her mom tried to make some small talk on the drive over, but Jennifer wasn&#39;t in the mood, leaving an awkward silent drive into the schools roundabout. Jennifer hopped out of the car, careful to not fall, her scrawny legs didn&#39;t even reach the ground by a wide margin now. &quot;Bye sweety, have a good day at school!&quot; Jennifer shot back a fake smile, her mom didn&#39;t know anything was different, why freak her out, it&#39;s not like she could do anything against some magical curse anyways. With a wave, Jennifer then half-heartedly dashed into the front door, before looking around. &quot;Shit&quot; she muttered, she had no idea what classes she had in her freshman year. She paced back and forth for a few minutes, she looked at the clock, she still had ten minutes before the bell. As Jennifer decided to maybe head to the principles office, they&#39;d point her in the right direction, she turned the corner to bump into Katie.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s eyes lit up, finally a friend! Maybe Katie would understand, she could use a shoulder right now. Jennifer waved &quot;Hey Katie! I was wondering if you had a minute to talk.&quot; Jennifer felt intimidated, even by a friend, before they were almost the same height, with Katie just a inch shorter, now, she towered over her, her face nearly next to her breasts. Katie winced at Jennifer &quot;Ugh a freshman, what do you want?&quot; One of the girls that was walking next to her kept walking, giving a small handwave goodbye to Katie as the student left for class. Jennifer was confused &quot;Katie what do you mean? We&#39;ve been friends for years.&quot; Katie laughed &quot;Ha, why would I ever be friends with you? I don&#39;t even know how you know my name, what, do you want a spot on the cheerleading team?&quot; Jennifer was confused, she was a captain of the team, not Katie, had she really lost all her friends? Katie&#39;s eyes sized her up, top to bottom. &quot;Not with that body you aren&#39;t, maybe you should try stuffing your bra, if you&#39;re even wearing one that is. Besides, you have to be a junior to be a cheerleader.&quot; Katie pushed past Jennifer with indifference. &quot;Now I&#39;m going to be late to class, shove off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t believe it, not only was she cursed, she had been left behind all her friends! Her confusion only growing as she suddenly heard the bell ring, she was late! &quot;Damn it&quot; Jennifer cursed, she started to head to the principles office before she felt a tap on her shoulder. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; a girl exclaimed. Jennifer spun around, seeing a girl a good half a foot taller than herself. &quot;Hey Jennifer, we&#39;re already late for class we&#39;d better hurry.&quot; Jennifer blinked, obviously she was her friend, or at least friendly, and they shared a class, what fortune Jennifer thought. &quot;Um, yea let&#39;s go.&quot; Jennifer said, and she began to jog after the girl to her first class.<br />
<br />
School was grating, even more than normal, its one thing to suffer through math again, even worse when you already know everything being taught. Jennifer tried to stay awake, learning PEMDAS and Pythagorean Theorem all over again, who even used stupid triangles?!? Thankfully it seemed she shared all her classes with the girl, and Jennifer found herself meekly following her all day till lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sarah!&quot; Another student called out with a wave. Thank goodness, Jennifer thought, it would have been awkward if she had to ask for the girl&#39;s name. Sarah picked out a table and both sat their bags down before heading to the cafeteria line. As they both began to walk back to their tables a towering figure casted a shadow in front of Jennifer, she recognized him, Jeremy, one of the football players. If she thought Katie was tall compared to Jennifer, then Jeremy was like a mountain. Two other jocks appeared by his side, punks. &quot;You know the rules Jennifer, fork over the goods.&quot; Jennifer looked towards Sarah for help &quot;Wha-what?&quot; before Jennifer was pushed to the ground as one the boys grabbed her milk and another her cookie. Her food splashed all over her shirt as she looked up to the boys, they were absolutely massive, they could pick her up and throw her a mile away if they wanted, with one arm! But rational thinking had given way, as Jennifer screamed out &quot;You jerk!&quot; As she scrambled to stand up. She tried to slap Jeremy but her height and wimpy arms, even with a small jump only managed to barely slap his neck. Jeremy and the boys started laughing. &quot;Aw, little baby gonna cry?&quot; Another boy interjected &quot;Without her milk how is she gonna grow up?&quot; The boys shoved past Jennifer again as she tried in vain to spit back something of a insult.<br />
<br />
Sarah rushed to Jennifer&#39;s side &quot;Hey its ok, those jerks always bully you, I never thought I&#39;d see you stand up to them. Let&#39;s go back to the table I have a towel in my bag.&quot; Sarah tried to dry Jennifer&#39;s shirt the best she could but it had only made more of a stain. &quot;I have an extra shirt from P.E. if you want that&quot; Sarah consoled. Jennifer agreed and took the shirt to the bathroom. Inside a stall she slipped off her t-shirt and put on Sarah&#39;s shirt, it was a light yellow blouse, unfortunately it looked way too big on Jennifer, its seems hanging down to her mid-thigh, only really realizing how much of chicken legs she had. Even worse it was so loose and light you could easily see the darker colored training bra underneath. Jennifer shook her head, she almost wanted to go back to the t-shirt, but unballing it and seeing the splatter of mashed potato made her reconsider. <br />
<br />
Jennifer was glad the rest of the day was easy, while she struggled to keep up in PE, it was nothing she couldn&#39;t push through, same with homeroom, she tried to find anyone who resembled her friend, but found no one, and she promptly sat in the corner of the classroom all alone, looking out the window until the bell rang.<br />
<br />
Jennifer got home to see her mom and dad preparing dinner. &quot;One nice thing about being younger I guess.&quot; she muttered. She retired early to her room, rummaging again through her bottom dresser to find some pajamas. Jennifer winced, bright pink pajamas, with the top having a cartoon princess logo on it, was this the only stuff in her size? She slipped off Sarah&#39;s blouse, she&#39;d have to return that tomorrow, and put on her pajama bottoms, still wary of top, she wasn&#39;t ready to resign her fate as a kid just yet, even after this long day, and elected to just stick with another t-shirt from her dresser. She started to work on some homework that was due the next morning. &quot;Looking on the bright side, this stuff is much easier than I remember&quot; she said, confidently solving most of the questions within a few minutes. Her mom poked her head in the room. &quot;Time for bed Jenni.&quot; Jennifer looked at the clock, almost 8pm, the day seemingly flew. &quot;Well, at least that&#39;s one day down, maybe this isn&#39;t that hard at all?&quot; Jennifer said as she nestled into her pillow and wrapped herself in her blanket.</p>
