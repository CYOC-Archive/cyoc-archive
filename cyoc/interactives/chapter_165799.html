<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both now fully dressed, with Ophelia in her opened back, black cocktail dress with a more than generous plunge. Heather on the other hand, was wearing a long, black, high waist skirt with a slit down the one side which started just at her hip. To complete the outfit, she had prepared a black, crisscross, v-neck crop top. The top wasn&#39;t her favorite since had gotten it as a joke gift from Lexi last year. But since it was custom made by Lexi herself, she had decided only to wear it only when attending special dates. What made the too unique was that Lexi only designed it to have 1 long sleeve on the right arm, with the left arm remaining sleeveless.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, the joke was that her sister had designed the top for a cup size slightly larger than Heather&#39;s. However, that no longer was a problem. The top now fit perfectly, and was way more comfortable to wear than she was expecting. She had to admit, her sister was really a great designer.<br />
<br />
When Lexi told her their parents she wanted to go into fashion, they hadn&#39;t immediatly supported her fully. But let her make a few samples to send to a few competitions for evaluations. She apparently was a big hit and had been given an offer by a big brand name to intern with them for a year as a designer&#39;s assistant. After which she was hired on full time as the &quot;designer&#39;s apprentice&quot;, as she called it. This top had been one of her side projects durring the internship.<br />
<br />
Finishing up the final touches with her makeup, Heather left the bathroom, ready to head out with Ophelia. Ophelia had gone all out this time, booking a reservation at an extremely facny restaurant. One where you would be turned away for wearing any color clothing other than black, kind of fancy. <br />
<br />
Ophelia was just putting on one of her 8&quot; thigh high, soulless stelleto boots. The shaft hugging her legs tightly. Her long nearly pure white hair, was once again back into the style it was in when she had first arived earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not wearing you cock?&quot; Joked Ophelia, standing up to kiss Heather. &quot;Just kidding. You look lovely, reguardless of if you have a cock or a pussy. Although I kind of wanted to see how much your skirt bulged from your balls. I bet they would have looked really sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you horny dragon. Only you could find a pair of softball sized nuts and a bulge which looks like I stuffed a bowling pin down my skirt sexy.&quot; Replied Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;No really. Maybe you could ask Lexi to design something for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then. Next time we see her, you can ask about it.&quot; Heather said, deciding that she is not ever going to ask that herself. &quot;Let me just get my heels on so we can head out. We dont want to be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather had brought a pair of black, knee high, lace up, gladiator heels with a 5.5&quot; stilletto heel. Noticing them, Ophelia felt they looked really sexy on Heather&#39;s long legs. She licked her lips, part of her was wanting to call the night off and just return back to their bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-uh, bad dragon girl&quot; playfully scolded Heather. &quot;If you are a good girl tonight, maybe I&#39;ll let you lick my massive balls clean of sweat while wearing this skirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am, Ophelia will be on her best behavior&quot; Ophelia energetically stated, having fun playing along with her dom. She knew Heather was just playing around, but that didn&#39;t mean she would not be interested in her offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, lets go, the place isn&#39;t far from here, so we can just walk there. Or do you want to get a driver?&quot; Asked Heather as they left the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im fine walking, since even if my feet look like they would be in pain at this angle, my foot is naturally shapped to look like this. But I do think a ride may be better. It has been raining recently, and I would hate to get our clothes wet&quot; reasoned Ophelia.<br />
<br />
Heather took out her phone, which was storred inside of a pocket that was tucked under her right boob. The entire shape was keep concealed by the contour of the top. Unlocking it, she opened up an app to get a driver service to pick them up. Making the request she quuckly put her phone back, a feat which was done so smoothly that Ophelia guessed she had practiced so that she didn&#39;t accidentally pop a boob or a nipple out of her top, nor draw too much unwanted attention to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;They will be here in 2 minutes. However we will be sharing the ride with another client I guess. Apparently they also are heading to the same place as us, so the driver offered to take the 3 of us for a slightly discounted price.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats fine, it wont take that long to get there anyways. I wonder if we know the other people?&quot; said Ophelia chearfully. She was not going to let anything ruin her mood tonight.<br />
<br />
Just a short while later, their ride showed up. Nothing fancy, just a 4 door car. However the passenger in the front seat was very unexpected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lexi? What are you doing here? Didn&#39;t you have some special dinner event to celebrate one of your designs appearing in the newest clothing line your company is putting out?&quot; Asked a shocked Heather. <br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way! The other client was you sis? You should have told me you were going here, we could have left together back at the house. Is this the one who asked you on the date, though I thought you said it was your friend, Ophelia, you know, the kid who always hangs out at our house. The one you had over last week. Man, I feel sorry for him. Though, I guess I also never would have taken you as being a lesbian. Also, cute top by the way, who made it?&quot; Questioned Lexi, laughing at the last part as she got out of the car to hug Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Either way, I am glad the outfut I prepared for you ended up looking this good on you. And I swear, you must have gained another cup size again, or did you sneek out to get some implants?&quot; continued Lexi, giving her sister a playful squeeze. She always was a bit eccentric and impulsive. A bad habit from her childhood which had fully integrated into being just another part of her identity. Heather was also use to it, being easily the largest up top of her 3 sisters, had meant Lexi would grope her a lot whenever she wore something sexy. Simply put, Lexi was a pervert, who was open about it and she had almost no shame to speak of.<br />
<br />
Lexi was cute to say the least. She had straight, shoulder length, hair, dyed light blonde, with one side tucked behind her right ear. Her bright green eyes were unique to only her. Her two identical sisters both had blue eyes, the same as with Heather. Apparently, one of their great, great grandparents supposedly had green eyes, but the rest of her family had only ever had blue or brown. <br />
<br />
She was wearing an identical skirt to Heather&#39;s along with the same too, only this one had the sleeves flipped. Anyone who saw the 2 of them would easily know they were sisters. Even though they were not identical, they still ended up sharing nearly every feature. The only major differences were eye color and cup size. While Lexi and her sisters all had respectable C-cups, they couldn&#39;t match Heather&#39;s Fs, now FFs while full of milk. She had gotten those from her father&#39;s side while her sisters took from their mother&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening, Miss Hot Date, I&#39;m Alexis, Heather&#39;s sister incase you didn&#39;t hear me before&quot; greeted Lexi to Ophelia, not recognizing that she was the same person as the boy who had been almost like a younger brother to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;For god sakes Lexi, can you just do a proper greeting for once? Why did you call my girlfriend, Miss Hot Date?&quot; Complained Heather, somewhat embarrassed to be blood relatives. Ophelia also somewhat cringed at being called Miss Hot Date. She had heard worse from Lexi, but this one just didn&#39;t fit the current mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious? She has 6 tits. 2 of which are nearly the size of our heads. She also has wings, and a even a tail. How can I not call her hot. I don&#39;t even know her and she already has me nearly dripping. Ah, sorry, please don&#39;t take it personally, I&#39;m simply a girl who is a bit of a pervert, especially for cute girls with big tits like you. If you ever need a custom outfit hit me up, I would love to design an entire wardrobe around your body. It isn&#39;t everyday you get a to design clothes for a girl who is part dragon. Tell me how do you feel about skin tight tops with open holes for your boobs to fit through?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh pass for now, but the idea is really kinky, and maybe in the near future I could let you design for me. Also I want a design for Heather too, one that shows off her massive b-mmmhmhhm&quot; started Ophelia before Heather forcably shut her up. &quot;Not not&quot; whispered Heather through gritted teeth in a voice so low only Ophelia&#39;s improved hearing could pick it up. Turning back to her sister with an obviously forced grin &quot;Shall we? I would hate to be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting the hint, both Lexi and Ophelia dropped the topic for the moment, but they agreeded in secret to continue it later. All 3 then entered the car. &quot;Oh yeah, I won&#39;t go into detail, but this girl is Ophelia, the same Ophelia as the boy you know. Somethings happened and she looks like this now, also we are now officially dating. And that is all.&quot; Ended heather, emphasizing the last part while looking directly at Ophelia. Apparently letting Lexi know that she was pregnant with Heather&#39;s children was not in the plans at the moment.</p>
