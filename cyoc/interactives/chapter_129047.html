<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day seemed to fly by for John. Each period felt like it barely lasted at all. He couldn&#39;t believe how easy his day was. But tonight he had a game. All the men gathered in the locker room. They were were changing into their uniforms for the game tonight. He had been preparing them for the last four years and now their skills would be tested before graduating. He knew they were strong. John had been the one to train them. Their 18 year old bodies had been through a lot but looking down at his computer he thought about making them better.<br />
<br />
The thought only lasted in his head for a second before he started typing into his computer. &#39;Everyone on the team is part animal. No one thinks of it as strange. Steve and Lance are 20% part wolf.&#39; His attention turned to his two star quarterbacks. They were talking nonchalantly. Instantly Steve&#39;s brown hair became a few shades darker. His ears changed to a pointed shape and migrated to the top of his head. For a second John could see the sharp toothy grin as he smiled at a joke his friend had made. His already defined muscles started to grow a little larger. Hair covered over his skin just a little more.  He was standing a little more on his toes. The cleats he was wearing changed to accommodate the larger paws. <br />
<br />
Lance was undergoing a similar transformation. The extra bulk he&#39;d kept from an unhealthy diet nearly vanishing off his body. His black hair turned into a more grayish color. Both men stood with more authority. Their 6&#39; frames gained at least an two or three inches in height. <br />
<br />
John grinned wildly as he watched his two confident stars walk around the locker room. They&#39;d each easily gained 20 pounds in that short time. John&#39;s attention quickly turned to his linemen, the big, broad shouldered, barrel chested men. There were so many of them he didn&#39;t want to go one by one. He just typed in, &#39;each of my linebackers are either 20% bear, bull, horse or gorilla.&#39;<br />
<br />
Instantly the already big guys started growing. Most of them were already over six foot but now they were 6&#39;5&quot; and up. Each one stretched to the top the of lockers if not above them. Mark&#39;s golden blonde hair turned to black. His already huge arms bulged out more. His legs looked a little shorter and he walked around in a squatted position. Most of his weight shifted to his upper body. His hands helped support him up. His big hands grew wider and fingers grew longer as dark hair rolled up and down his legs and hands. The same happened with his toes. The small digits easily lengthened to what appeared to be another set of hands. John saw him pick up his helmet with his feet. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jeff and Dennis are talking to each other like any other day. Their longer unruly hair shorten up into a more military style cut. They each scratch at their junk. Each bragging about their large, uncontrollable boners. Jeff&#39;s a few inches taller than Dennis. His muscles are more solid and defined. But Dennis is clearly the stronger one. Even with his belly he&#39;s able to lift significantly more than the taller horse. Both their ears grew to long points but Dennis&#39; hung down on the sides of his head while Jeff&#39;s stood straight up. Small horns poked their way out of Dennis&#39; hair. He shook his head subconsciously at the new appendages. Then a long ropy tail ran down from his spine.<br />
<br />
Still in his locker Wyatt let out a loud yawn. He leaned back stretching his entire body. His short brown hair growing into a shaggier mop on his head. Scratching at his rounding belly he yawned again. The already giant man grew another half a foot. He leaned in as more weight added to his frame making him quite the imposing man. Every part of him was just bigger, rounder and furrier. Whatever parts were still hairless practically disappeared beneath his densely coated hair. Before he was close to 260&#39;s now he was easily standing over 7 foot and easily weighing in the 350&#39;s if not more. <br />
<br />
Looking around he couldn&#39;t help but notice that some of the other players had changed without his direct input. Each of them had several animal parts changed about their bodies. John grinned watching them talk to each other like nothing had even happened.</p>
