<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a snowy December night and all through the house not a creature was stirring not even a- BANG -mouse? Another bang reverberated the house. This bang was coming from one of the bedroom’s in the house. In this room was 14 year old Thomas who was banging his desk. He wasn’t like the other kids in his small neighborhood, how so? He hated Christmas. He hated it because he never got anything that he wanted regardless of whether he was naughty or nice. His belief of Santa fizzled off when he was 7. It doesn’t help that his younger brother 12 year old Gerald was a spoiled brat and his older sister 18 year old Cathy ALWAYS managed to get what she wanted. He sometimes wonders if his parents forgot he existed when Christmas shopping until the end. It doesn’t help that tomorrow was the first day of ‘12 days of Christmas’.<br />
<br />
“School is going to be a nightmare the next 3 days…” <br />
<br />
Thomas sighed. At least school was out by the 4th day of Christmas. He just decided to sleep. <br />
<br />
He yawned as sunlight filtered into his room. He barely had time to relax before his mother was ushering him to get ready and out the door. The bus ride was a nightmare, 1st and 2nd period were nightmares. He was tempted to just hide in the bathroom for lunch but he didn’t. It wasn’t until the end of lunch that one of his friends grabbed him and began talking nonsense until Thomas quickly shut him down.<br />
<br />
“Listen, I don’t care for Christmas and I don’t believe in Santa”<br />
<br />
Thomas wrenched free of his friend’s grip and went to the bathroom locking himself into a stall, he didn’t feel comfortable with using the urinal right now. As he was using the toilet he heard someone whispering outside the stall.<br />
<br />
On the first day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
The start of a white beard<br />
<br />
Thomas’ chin began to tickle as some white scruff began to grow on his face. It grew out to become a small beard. Thomas ran his hand along the the small beard before running out to the mirror and began trembling at what he saw. He looked around for who whispered that but found nobody. There’s no way he could let somebody see this. He quickly ran out of the school and back home. He didn’t care how cold it was. He knew his mom would be home since she’s a stay at home mom so he ran around back grabbed the hidden foldable stairs and climbed up to his room dragging the stairs up in with him and folding them back up. He hid them in the closet. He spent the day freaking out and trying to pluck out the beard hairs to absolutely no avail. Eventually it was almost the time that he is supposed get home.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…” <br />
<br />
He used some makeup to cover up the beard since it was just small enough to cover up.He grabbed his school stuff and climbed back out the window putting the steps back in their original spot. He acted naturally as he walked through the door. His mom seemed to fall for it as they had a pretty short conversation before he went upstairs and he blew a sigh of relief. In the end he just did what he normally does on a typical day. After dinner he just shut off the lights in his room and went to bed hoping that when he woke up everything would be normal. Unfortunately that would not be the case. This is proven when Thomas woke up in the early morning, about 5 AM, to more whispering.<br />
<br />
On the second day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A protruding belly<br />
<br />
Thomas let out a groan as his belly began to expand. It wasn’t just his belly either, his entire body seemed to swell. The belly is just what swelled the most. It took him a moment of laying there feeling heavier before snapping fully awake and running, er… sort of hobbling to the bathroom. His belly jiggled as he ‘ran&#39;. He took one look at himself both in the mirror and down at his body. The weight he had magically gained was unbelievable. Not to mention the small beard wasn’t covered up anymore. He pinched himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming before trying his best to calm down, which proved to be incredibly difficult. That’s when he heard shuffling in his mother’s room.<br />
<br />
“Shit… she’s coming for her early morning bathroom break!”<br />
<br />
Thomas whispered to himself. He looked around frantically before hiding in the closet. It may have had a sort of see through door but his mother never really looked in here. As soon as his mother entered the room he covered his mouth and held his breath as best as he could. He could NOT let his mother, or anybody for that matter. After his mom left he just sat in there silently crying. He heard his mother leave the house later on which made him feel a bit relieved. Thank god she worked today. It meant he could stay hidden at home and not have any ‘gone missing’ crap. Stay at home he did, sitting in the closet all day only leaving for food and water. Even after his mother returned he made it sound like he was in his room and not very hungry. He managed to stay hidden in the closet for the whole night. He did sleep of course but only for about 3 hours. He woke up early and just sat there until he could hear the whispering outside the closet door.<br />
<br />
On the third day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A brand new home<br />
<br />
This confused Thomas for a second before he grew dizzy and fell unconscious. Something picked up his unconscious body and carried him out and placed him in a sled before flying off. Thomas’ vision began to return. The dizziness in his head making his surroundings whirl around him. Eventually, after a few head shakes, his vision returned to him. He was sitting at a large mahogany desk in a large office like room that was decently colourful but still had a homey feel. He noticed a small person in the middle of the room. He had pointed ears and was dressed in mostly green- wait a minute. <br />
<br />
“Are you-?”<br />
<br />
“An elf yes” The elf said walking a bit closer “You’ve been chosen to be our new boss, if that wasn’t obvious enough already” Thomas just stared in awe. How was this possible. “I know you must be pretty confused and freaked out but all will become clear with time… very clear” Thomas did not like the sound of the elves voice at the end but he didn’t have much time to think about it before the elf says one last thing. “By the way, it took a whole day to get you here so…” The elf opens the door “have fun” he smiles and exits closing the door behind him and Thomas hears the all to familiar whispering behind him.<br />
<br />
On the fourth day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A much bigger beard<br />
<br />
Almost immediately Thomas felt the small white beard on his face began to grow and become bushier. Eventually it was down just past his upper chest. He tugged on the large beard but the pain that occured after insinuated that this was indeed real. He whipped around but saw nothing behind him. He sat there for a bit before exiting the room and exploring. The place he was in was huge… he knew it was probably Santa’s workshop in the North Pole. There was a greenhouse, stables, the toy assembly line, and a bunch of other places. When he came to the kitchen he encountered an older woman who smiled at him.<br />
<br />
“You still have a ways to go… but I can’t wait until you’re complete”<br />
<br />
Then she left the room with the soft smile still playing on her lips. Thomas was weirded out by that. He was also weirded out by the fact that if this really was real, she would be his wife soon. He shuddered a bit but pushed the thought out of his head as the sun began to set. He guessed that this workshop had a normal day night cycle despite being in the arctic. He was having trouble adjusting to this whole… thing. He didn’t even know what to call it. Instead he just wandered aimlessly before entering a room that seemed to be his room. He quickly fell asleep and when he woke up he heard exactly what he expected.<br />
<br />
On the fifth day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
An older age and a pair of glasses<br />
<br />
It kind of annoyed Thomas that the words didn’t flow. He ignored it though since it’s the least of his worries at the moment. His vision began to blur before it corrected as a pair of glasses slipped over his face. His 14 year old body began to age quite a lot. Though to what age is unknown. All he knows is that his skin became more weathered and wrinkled. He jumped out of the bed. He had to try and find a way to stop this. Maybe there was an elf who could help him? It was skeptical but what else could he do? He walked out to the toy assembly line and looked around. He saw a door labeled ‘Bruce the Powerful Elf’ He walked in and found a slightly bigger elf than the others.<br />
<br />
“Ah, it’s you. Enjoying yourself?”<br />
<br />
Thomas bit his lip and shook his head. Bruce grinned and leaned forward in his chair. “What? Did you want me to help you?” Thomas slowly nodded his head. “I never wanted this…” Bruce shrugged “I can understand. Here, I can’t turn you back but I can do something to help” Before Thomas could question him Bruce blew some dust into his face. At first he was incredibly annoyed but then grew tired very quickly before falling unconscious. “Help you by speeding up the process for you” Bruce smiled. For the next 3 days, Thomas was unconscious and missed the sixth, seventh, and eighth parts of the tf.<br />
<br />
On the sixth day of Christmas <br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A brand new Santa hat<br />
<br />
On the seventh day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A pair of large winter boots<br />
<br />
On the eighth day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A pair of white gloves<br />
<br />
Thomas woke up feeling numb. He groaned and sat up rubbing his temples a bit. He felt the hat atop his head and reached up to touch when he noticed the gloves on his hands. He shuddered a bit before whipping off the covers of the bed he was in to see the boots on his feet. He tried to remove these new foreign clothes but they refused to come off. When Bruce walked in Thomas wasted no time attacking him but Bruce easily used magic to blast him away. Thomas stood up and looked at Bruce. “What did you do?” “Knock you out for a few days” Bruce said coolly and Thomas let out a huff of indignance. Bruce just smiled and left the room. When Thomas followed him out <br />
he was nowhere to be found. Thomas noticed it was already pretty dark.<br />
<br />
“Great…”<br />
<br />
By this point he had already given up. He was just about ready to give up… and give up he did. For the next 3 days Thomas did literally nothing to stop any of this, he barely did anything at all. All he really did was reminisce about his family and friends. What happened over these days?<br />
<br />
On the ninth day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A black leather belt<br />
<br />
On the tenth day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A pair of fluffy red pants<br />
<br />
On the eleventh day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A red jacket with fluffy white trim<br />
<br />
It was that last day that freaked Thomas out. For one, when he woke up it was already late but that wasn’t the main problem. That was the elf looming over him with a creepy smile on his face. Thomas instantly jumped from the bed and ran from the room. He ran through the halls as more and more elves began chasing him. Eventually they chased him into the main area and outside where a sleigh and reindeer stood waiting. Right, it was Christmas Eve. While he was distracted, the elves created a circle around him and the sleigh. He looked around him at all the elves. He was incredibly freaked out but it didn’t last long before all the elves yelled out together.<br />
<br />
On the twelfth day of Christmas<br />
The elves gave to me<br />
A brand new Santa Claus!<br />
<br />
Thomas’ memories began to be sucked away with a yellow burst of light that spread across the world erasing everyone’s memories of Thomas. It only took a minute for Thomas to completely forget who he was leaving jolly ol’ saint nick behind. The elves cheered and Santa gave a hearty ‘Ho Ho Ho’ before climbing into the sleigh next to the sack of presents. He got the reindeer to go and off they went into the sky. As he passed over the elf village nearby he yelled out his signature saying to all the elves below.<br />
<br />
“Merry Christmas to all! And to all a good night!”</p>
