<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Free, the word was quite vague to the Genie. He set out walking the streets only to be seen as some wierd nitwit and fool dressed as he was in sheer slik bloomed out trousers and a tank top showing off his hairy chest. Maybe the most dishonored thing was the children who seen him as his slippers went to a coiled loop and had silver bells which tickled as he walk.<br />
<br />
Feeling ever so lost amoung humanity he went to the city park and sat on a bench overlooking a pond and fountain.<br />
<br />
A short time had passed as many people saw this strangely dressed man and kept a good distance from him. It was instead a man walking and talking to himself, sounding as angry to himself as was the genie looking queer to all who saw him.<br />
<br />
Fate touched the two and it was the genie who asked the man as he passed by, &quot;Do you have a need, I might be able to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked up from his own troubles and eyed this kook standing there in the Park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great as if I'm not in enough trouble already I should ask help from one who is dressed like a throwaway from some whore house!&quot; grumbled the man.<br />
<br />
Genie knew a great deal having lived for more than three thousand years. The language used by the man made little sense except the part about the genie looking like something from a whore house. That made really good sense and he scowled at the man feeling himself insulted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I be so poor a specimen of humanity that one such as you should defile my integrity! You need to learn some manners my good man!&quot; said the Genie holding his wrath in check.<br />
<br />
The looked at Genie and then lowered his head feeling due and proper shame. &quot;You are right and it is me in my troubles which is wrong, I it would have been better for all I should not have been born!&quot; groaned the man as he began to walk away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be you in such dire trouble, please come and talk to me I have learned much and might be able to help!&quot; beckoned the Genie remembering his good master's wish that he be just with men and mankind.<br />
<br />
Turning and looking at the Genie the man began to burst out a story of fool hardy actions and making his life and family a virtual hell. Again he wished to the thought of never having been born and the Genie listen as he planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think there is a remedy of mutual help for your troubles and my desire to fit into your world, your time, and find a place to work justice as commanded by a good and gone friend. You wish to be as though you were never born but at the same time want and wish to know and remember those you love and care for, correct?&quot; said Genie.<br />
<br />
The man sat wide eyed with wonder and gave a nod as if to agree.<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall become as you and take your place in the family and among your friends. We together shall reside in the same household, me governing all there and you at my side. You knowing all, seeing and hearing all, you my companion and if granted will talk then to me from time to time, agreed?&quot; asked as he offered said the Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, what you thinking of, I'm not some pet or fucking animal, No, noway now get away from me, you, you fucking sick'o!&quot; yelled the man as he got up and walked away.<br />
<br />
Genie thought his plan seemed the best for both and jumped to follow the man and try to talk some sense to him.<br />
<br />
Time and time again the man yelled his favorite four letter word at the Genie till it finally came to the forefront of their conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, just what do you mean when calling me a crazy fuckhead?&quot; asked Genie.<br />
<br />
The man explained what the four letter word ment and that it wasn't considered a compliment.<br />
<br />
Genie stood looking at the man and then asked, &quot;Per chance is there another fuckhead around to which I might compare my new title to what it might be in your place and time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angered at the conversation which was making him more mad as time went along the Man turned to look for yet another such, that he'd call a fuckhead for the Genie to relate to and then maybe leave him alone.<br />
<br />
Over to the far side of the park was a mut dog standing mounted over a poodle dog. The male was a Cocker Spaniel and he was mated into a sleek and sexy black French Poodle. An owner of the poodle was sceaming her head off and it seemed just right for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, over there is what a fuckhead is doing to that Poodle dog. He's a bastard making yet more bastards and he is like you and me, understand?&quot; asked and said the Man as he quickly headed away.<br />
<br />
Genie looked and then thought for a moment as his bright wit of a mind worked and decided all to once.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you agree then I'll agree!&quot; called out the Genie.<br />
<br />
As possible a willing gesture the man turned to Genie and gave him a one finger salute. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I agree and now if shall be as I planned!&quot; said Genie as the world to the man slowly faded away.<br />
<br />
Slowly he raised his head and looked around. He was in the kitchen of his own apartment and the wife was busy making breakfast. He got up slowly and walking about he had to look up at her she seemed to having grown very tall. Then in came his children the three of them all readied for going to school. It was as he saw his own self walk in that things began to become twisted.<br />
<br />
Insensed at the sight of seeing his body walk into the room and him not being in it, the man who was tried to speak out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet Genie boy, we are trying to say grace and don't need your noise!&quot; said his old self and then the family began to pray together.<br />
<br />
Upset and wanting some answers Genie boy ran off to the bathroom for a good look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
A bound up and instead of standing and looking into the mirror he found himself poised on the counter and could eye his total self.<br />
<br />
One wired feeling came of him as there in the mirror was a strange bastard of a dog. He was most assuredly male as his doggy sheath hung out in the open for all to see. He was shaggy but large, his head and muzzel long and narrow. He had long floppy ears and four legs with big round paws. A long tail shot up and out his reared and it wagged the more he looked at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you agreed with my plan and like the dogs you became our fuckhead pet. Your all male and still have the family jewels between your hind legs. I though you might find being one of the unborn a little dull if your nuts were gone. Your my pet and I am your replacement, this will work for us both well till I rearrange your troubles and then move on.&quot; said the Genie to his pup.</p>
