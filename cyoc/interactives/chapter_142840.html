<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“CUBS!” Jett barked as he stormed into the football team’s cabana. Jett’s fiery red fur seemed to accentuate his state of embarrassment, his skin flush red after the encounter with Adrian, Gabe, and Patrick.<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes, Master!” Two thick fireplugs stumbled up to Jett, falling to their knees before him.  Heads down, quivering, dressed identically in matching cheerleader shorts.  As the football team captain, Jett had his pick of the cheerleader team, and selected the two shortest cubs for his pleasure.<br />
<br />
“We missed you, Master!” Whimpered Pike.  6’2”, 440lbs, brown hair, deep brown doe eyes, tiny 16” cock.<br />
<br />
“How may we serve you, Master?” Cried out Tuck. 6’2”, 440lbs, black hair, deep brown doe eyes, tiny 17” cock.<br />
<br />
Jett had a type: thick, stocky, compact, with dark features, and modestly hung.  His cubs Pike and Tuck were stars amongst the cheerleaders, and two of the smallest boys on campus.<br />
<br />
At least, they *were* the smallest boys.<br />
<br />
Jett couldn’t stop thinking about Dan!  Besides being even more compact than his boys, it was clear his cock was under a foot long… “Fuck…” Jett growled, his 28-incher stiffening as his thoughts were captivated by Dan’s endearing looks.<br />
<br />
“Boys,” Jett patted his thigh, then jerked his thumb upwards, his two slaves complying immediately like well-trained dogs. “Strip out of your cheer uniforms, put on the matching thongs I picked out for you.”  Pike and Tuck thanked Jett for the orders and waddled off to change.<br />
<br />
Jett had been humiliated by Patrick--the redheaded powerlifting captain--while trying to pick-up Dan.  When had he gotten so big?  Jett could have sworn he was bigger, more hung, and even more dominant than Powerlifting-Patty…<br />
<br />
“M-Master!” His cubs whispered, fearful to interrupt Jett deep in thought.  “T-the thongs don’t fit…”  Pick and Tuck were blushing hard, cocks straining against the fabric which barely contained the head and balls.<br />
<br />
Jett pointed up, then swirled his finger around, the gesture they were trained to recognize as “turn around for me.”<br />
<br />
The boys complied, knowing disobedience was not tolerated, and fearful of the hotheaded redhead’s temper.<br />
<br />
“Looks fine to me, cubs.”  Jett grinned, basking in his power over the two heavily muscled boys.  The attention was making them chub up, the thongs straining more, cocks threatening to pop free.<br />
<br />
“Come with me, cubs.” Jett snapped, making a fist, gesturing his cubs to fall in-line.  Trained to obey his every command, Pike and Tuck adjusted their packages while standing behind Jett.  He was so intense, dominant, and powerful to them...not to mention physically intimidating with his massive size.  They couldn’t help but obey...and that helplessness made them enamoured with Jett.<br />
<br />
Pike and Tuck didn’t even realize Jett had walked them out of the cabana and into the bustling poolside.  It took a few gawking jeers and laughing footballers to snap them out of their submissive trance.<br />
<br />
Jett growled, loving the attention his property got.  This was his way of asserting his dominance after an embarrassing showing before Dan.<br />
<br />
“Cubs.” Jett turned, catching the lustful gazes of freshmen admiring Pike and Tuck, the base of their cocks exposed to the air.  “Has the powerlifting captain, Patrick, always been so…big?”<br />
<br />
Pike and Tuck looked at each other, worried about upsetting their Master. “W-Well...you’re much faster than him!” Pike blurted out.<br />
<br />
“A-And smart!”  Tuck joined in. “There’s no strategy in powerlifting, Master!”<br />
<br />
Jett furrowed his red brow, his piercing green eyes silencing his cubs.  “I’m thinking Patty and his friends are juicing.”<br />
<br />
“Er, but, Master, you use steroi--” Pike was cut off by a sharp look, his knees buckling as he started kissing at Jett’s feet, whimpering for forgiveness for even suggesting that.<br />
<br />
“No, no...Patrick has got something stronger.  I’m thinking Dan has got something to do with it...probably his new dealer.  We’re going to stop by their dorm, see what’s up.”  Jett walked off towards the dorms, his thick rump bouncing with each step.  “NOW, cubs.”  Pike and Tuck stumbled to catch up, Pike’s cock flopping free from the tiny thong.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Getting into Dan and Adrian’s dorm room was easy.  Tuck’s nimble sausage like fingers could pick a lock as well as he could do a standing-back-tuck.  Meanwhile, Pike played lookout, diverting attention away from that part of the dorm with his thickly muscled, thong-strapped ass.<br />
<br />
“Master...what makes you so sure Dan is responsible for Patrick’s size?”  Tuck asked timidly, peeking through Dan’s suitcase.  He had just moved onto campus, barely had time to unpack.<br />
<br />
“Patrick knows I have dibs on the swarthy shorties like Dan,” Jett flexed his massive arms at Tuck, watching his cock twitch and harden in the thong.  “And what stocky doe-eyed cub wouldn’t want to serve me?”<br />
<br />
Tuck loved Jett’s size...but knew Patrick was even bigger...the thought of that was making him stiffen up.<br />
<br />
“Looks like Dan only had time to unpack his laptop.”  Jett stood over the Chronivac, tapping the mousepad to wake it up.<br />
<br />
The screen flickered on, startling Jett.  He was overcome with this feeling that the thing was studying him as it booted up.<br />
<br />
“SCANNING NEW USER” The screen wrote out, rising up from the desk.  The entire room seemed to tip, sending Jett and Tuck falling to the floor while the laptop held firmly in place.  <br />
<br />
“What the actual fuck--” Jett trailed off, watching the air in the room ripple, an endless string of laptops spanning to the horizon, filling every conceivable moment of being.<br />
<br />
*pop*<br />
<br />
Jett was standing over the desk still, the laptop was no more...or, rather, it had always been a sleek, white, tablet, running software that looked remarkably like the football manager suite on Jett’s iPad.  The interface was so familiar and intuitive to Jett, he knew exactly how to interact with the device and tapped into it.<br />
<br />
Similar to his football manager program, he could pull up the stats of himself and Jett.  Their physical stats, 3D rendered sprites, and detailed life history all available within tabs.<br />
<br />
“Huh...what’s a cub like Dan doing playing fantasy football?”  Jett decided to leave a little surprise for Dan; a coy gesture only fantasy football geeks would get.<br />
<br />
Because of the limitations of the proximity sensor, Jett couldn’t pick-up Dan’s profile, but he could still key-in broader, more creative commands.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to put everyone under 6’4” on our team, The Bulls.” Jett grinned, knowing this command would encompass Dan’s sprite.  Surely he would interpret being placed on Jett’s team as a romantic gesture of possessiveness.  Satisfied, he hit save.<br />
<br />
>> INTERPRETED COMMAND: SPLICE WITH BULL GENETICS.  CONFIRMING IN 3...2...1…<br />
<br />
Jett shook the device, trying to cancel the dialog…”Oh well, its just a fantasy league game…right, Tuck?”  Jett’s already pale ginger skin went ghost white.<br />
<br />
“M-Master!  What’s wrong?”  Tuck grunted out a moo-like whimper.</p>
