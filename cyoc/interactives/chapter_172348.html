<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer spent the next 10 minutes chatting animatedly with her friends while they all ate lunch. Jen noticed that she was eating her salad in a much more refined and feminine manner than before.<br />
<br />
She was talking more openly and freely than she had in years. While she had had a couple good friends on the cheerleading squad, there was always a barrier or distance between them, a constant contest for attention and status to keep the pecking order in line. The cheerleading table at lunch was usually limited to discussions about the next football game, the football players, parties and hookups, or trashy reality shows. <br />
<br />
With Amy, Katie, and Lisa though, everything came easy. They jumped from silly stories, to what shows they were watching, to how well they were studying for their classes, to current events, or to what books they were currently reading. What surprised Jen the most was that she could keep up with them.<br />
<br />
Jennifer found it a wonderful change of pace. She was barely half a day into her &quot;curse&quot; and was already having a better time than she could remember in recent memory. <br />
<br />
They were all listening raptly to Lisa talk about the book she was currently reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fascinating&quot; she was saying. &quot;It charts the course of the development of us as a species. Examining how certain pressures, basic human psychology, and biological needs helped form and guide human societies over time, as well as a glimpse into how those things influence us even now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fascinating!&quot; said Amy, thoroughly intrigued. &quot;What&#39;s your favorite part so far? Can I borrow it when you&#39;re done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; replied Lisa happily. &quot;and I liked the revelation that writing systems arose out of a need for complex trade, mathematics, and inventory management first, rather than for storytelling. Most of our stories and legends stayed oral for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer let her focus drift away from the interesting book and looked over her friend.<br />
<br />
At 5&#39;11&quot;, Lisa Dominguez was a fairly tall girl, with almond colored skin and long, thick, black hair that she kept in messy double ponytails, their tips reaching down below her shoulders, draping over her chest. Her body was somewhat plain, not too much meat on her bones, but not rail thin either. Her face was fairly cute however, wide lips and a shapely, roman style nose. She wore a round pair of glasses that sat in front of the dark brown pits of her eyes that one could get lost in when she spoke passionately about a topic, which was often.<br />
<br />
Lisa was wearing high-waisted navy colored pants that fit snugly around her legs and hips, a burnt yellow button-up blouse, and light brown leather loafers. <br />
<br />
Half-tuning back into the conversation, Jennifer saw Lisa still talking about the book, but to an enraptured Katie now. Peering to her side, Jen saw that Amy seemed to be busy leaning down to mess with one of her boots. Figuring that Amy was fixing a strap on her shoe or something, Jennifer turned her attention back to their other friend, Katie Yang.<br />
<br />
Katie Yang was of Korean descent on her mother&#39;s side, and taller than both Amy and Jen at 5&#39;4&quot;. A bit of a tomboy, Katie was fairly thin, but had tanned skin, toned legs, and a solid core from lots of skateboarding. She had a cute face with a thick line of freckles across the bridge of her nose and below her eyes (courtesy of her Irish father), with neck length teal-dyed hair in a messy bob. <br />
<br />
Katie was clad in a worn red hoodie over a gray tank top, a pair of tight black jeans, and some grimy white high-top Vans with a pair of white crew socks sticking out of the tops.<br />
<br />
She was still gazing unblinkingly at Lisa, soaking up every word she said, smiling and laughing whenever Lisa did. <br />
<br />
Jennifer felt new memories appear of she and Amy having long conversations about how obvious it was that Katie was into Lisa.  They&#39;d tried a few times to set up situations where the two would end up alone together, but nothing ever came of it. Amy felt that Katie was too shy to admit her feelings, and Lisa a bit too oblivious to see what was in front of her. <br />
<br />
Jennifer had to agree with her analysis. She pondered how they could finally get the two of them to get together.<br />
<br />
Maybe another game night? Thought Jen. No, that&#39;s never worked before, we get too competitive to . Movie night again? No, we all get too into watching. <br />
<br />
Wait! She thought. I&#39;ve got the curse to give away now, maybe we could...<br />
<br />
She was pulled abruptly from her thoughts by the sensation of something soft rubbing its way across the top of her silk-encased foot. Jennifer shuddered slightly at the pleasurable tingles it caused before looking down to discover its source.<br />
<br />
Amy had unbuckled one of her boots, allowing her to slip her sock-clad foot out. She was now slowly running it along Jen&#39;s, sending ripples of pleasure up Jen&#39;s leg. <br />
<br />
Jen looked up at Amy&#39;s face to see her girlfriend giving Jen a seductive look, her orange-brown eyes twinkling devilishly as her toes continued their insistent rubbing with greater vigor. <br />
<br />
Jennifer gave an involuntary girly &quot;eep&quot; of lust, biting her lip to stop any further sounds from escaping her. She placed her hands in her lap and straightened up on the bench, trying to ignore the fresh wave of wetness in her crotch. The newly-minted girly nerd had never reacted in such a way before this, and she&#39;d never known anyone who was into such things. She couldn&#39;t deny now though, just how good it felt.<br />
<br />
Her eyes still half-lidded, Amy puts a finger to her lips before winking and nodding slightly toward the other two girls, removing her foot from atop Jen&#39;s as she does so. Her other free hand finds Jen&#39;s, giving them a quick squeeze before letting go.<br />
<br />
Jennifer nods, smiling quietly, and turns back to look at Katie and Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa was just finishing up her monologue about her book, Lisa still appeared as if she hadn&#39;t blinked at all in the past five minutes. Jennifer resumed talking with them as Amy bent down again to put her boot back on.<br />
<br />
Soon after that lunch ended, and the girls headed out to their remaining three classes. They proceeded much the same as her morning ones had, with Jennifer finding herself answering many questions correctly and picking up the new material with great ease.<br />
<br />
Finally, the last bell of the day rang, signaling their freedom from classes. For the first time ever, Jen was almost disappointed to hear it. She had been having a blast in class, and only the promise of intimate times with Amy was more enticing than her wish to learn more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great job in US History today!&quot; said Lisa as she walked next to Jen. Katie trailed behind her slightly. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know John Brown did all that with a broadsword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it was a crazy time.&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girly girl.&quot; came a voice from behind them. Amy came running up, some physics textbooks in her arms from her last class, skirt fluttering about her thighs. Jen was about to respond when Amy leaned forward and kissed her on the lips. A shock of tingles erupted from her lips, and her stomach fluttered. Amy leaned back with a satisfied smile.<br />
<br />
All four started walking out of school. Katie and Lisa split off to get on their bus, while Amy and Jen headed towards their own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let us know if you guys want to hang this weekend!&quot; said Katie as they parted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will do!&quot; said Jennifer brightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to get back to your place to...*study*.&quot; said Amy, with an extremely over the top emphasis on the last work.<br />
<br />
Jen looked at her, her heel twisting idly again. She pushed down the butterflies in her stomach and rolled her eyes in mock exasperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re insatiable.&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;..and you love it.&quot; replied the dark-haired nerd.<br />
<br />
They boarded their bus and headed back to Jen&#39;s house.</p>
