<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailey gazed at her computer screen, narrowing her eyes as she reviewed paperwork. The Superior Church case may finally be closed, yet S.P.E.A.R&#39;s work was never done. Reaching for her coffee, she was pleasantly surprised as someone handed her a fresh mug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite welcome Director.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey paused, she recognized that voice. Turning the vampire director&#39;s eyes went wide as she gazed at the intruder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith how the hell did you get in here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My secret, director,&quot; Abolith replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know if this is about Fukushu that answer is still no,&quot; Hailey grumbled. &quot;As I&#39;ve told every other emissary he assaulted my agents. I need to protect my people and show them that they&#39;re protected. No one comes to work to be a punching bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t come here to beg for my beloved&#39;s release vampire,&quot; Abolith scoffed. &quot;Although trying to keep him here is a fools errand. I came to talk about a recent happening within the kitsune realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, please don&#39;t tell me another war broke out,&quot; Hailey groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Abolith replied. &quot;Yomi has returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hailey paused, raising an eyebrow. Who was Yomi? Were they dangerous? The last thing Hailey needed was another supernatural crisis on her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by your expression you have no idea who Yomi is,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;So I will keep it brief. Yomi is my beloved&#39;s sister. After more than twenty years she has returned to the land of the living... and my beloved must not know while he is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay two questions,&quot; Hailey replied in annoyance. &quot;One, how in the blue hell did she come back from the dead and two why shouldn&#39;t Fukushu be told?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her return is complicated,&quot; Abolith said. &quot;What is important is this. If my beloved were to learn of Yomi&#39;s return, he would tear down this entire facility to reach her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re giving your beloved too much credit,&quot; Hailey stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I believe you aren&#39;t giving him enough,&quot; Abolith countered. &quot;Over twenty years ago Yomi died at the hands of Lilith the Demon Queen. My beloved became so enraged he risked destroying all of reality to avenge her. Then you have the matter of this Superior Church. Why do you think he would involve himself so fully in a matter that did not involve the kitsune?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Abolith said. &quot;I have known Fukushu for centuries. During that time, I have seen him lose control three times. When his master Akane died, he wiped the Kumiho empire off the map. When Yomi died, he tried to destroy reality and you have just witnessed what happened when Mason was put at risk. If he were to learn that his sister has returned from the dead, he would reduce your precious organization to ash to reach her. Just because you believe you have him contained, doesn&#39;t mean he is. Tread carefully and tell no one of what I have told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
**********************************<br />
<br />
Beneath S.P.E.A.R HQ, as Abolith spoke with Director Meyers, Fukushu knelt within his cell. The nine tail kitsune now meditated, clearing his mind, seeking guidance on where he should proceed from here.<br />
<br />
Vengeance had nearly taken the life of Mason, the image of that trickle of blood from the boy&#39;s head haunting the kitsune general. What started as a mission to destroy that which threatened his nephew, could have easily taken his life. It troubled Fukushu, made him question everything he had done. Had his lust for revenge finally reached a breaking point?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu opened his eyes slowly, turning his head as he noticed a guard standing in front of his cell. Rising to his feet, the kitsune watched the C.O. carefully as he unlocked the trap.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the drill,&quot; he said. &quot;Place your hands in the trap and don&#39;t make any sudden moves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, slowly approaching the cell trap before placing his hands along the opening. He had no qualms with these officers, they were simply doing their duty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tails too,&quot; they stated.<br />
<br />
Fukushu smirked, recalling and incident in his first days with Henry Amberhill. Upon his arrival the other prisoners were shocked to see the fearsome kitsune in S.P.E.A.R custody. Most said nothing to him, fearing his reputation. Amberhill, however, wished to test the kitsune, to prove he was the one who ran this cell block. Fukushu put the werewolf in his place after striking out with his tails. Not only had he shattered the werewolves plexiglass cell, he had knocked him unconscious. Since then Amberhill said nothing whenever he passed, and Fukushu&#39;s tails were placed in restraints.<br />
<br />
Exiting his cell, Fukushu was now led down the corridor flanked by two members of Omega Squad with another C.O. behind him. This was standard practice when dealing with the kitsune, despite him never being aggressive with the staff. As he passed Amberhill&#39;s cell, werewolf and kitsune glared at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t even think about Fukushu,&quot; the C.O. warned.<br />
<br />
Fukushu didn&#39;t act, the pair glaring at one another until Amberhill&#39;s cell was out of sight. As they continued on their path, kitsune began to wonder where they were going.<br />
<br />
They had passed the recreation area as well as medical. Fukushu puzzled as they made their way to the elevator. He wasn&#39;t expecting a visit today, where could they be taking him? Fukushu watched as the elevator began to rise, leaving the ninth level before stopping on the fourth. What could possibly be on the fourth level?<br />
<br />
As they proceeded, Fukushu took a moment to study his surroundings. Unlike the lower levels, the fourth floor was far less secured. If anything, it resembled a office with numerous conference rooms and work stations positioned within. Fukushu noticed many S.P.E.A.R personnel milling about, casting a worrisome glance at the kitsune as he was led inside a room. Once there, the escorting officers removed his restraints before closing the door. Puzzled, Fukushu rubbed his wrists before studying the other occupants of the room.<br />
<br />
There were three other prisoners here, two humans and a kitsune with a single tail. Confused, he studied the kitsune carefully, wondering why a one tailed kit would be imprisoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was....one of the unlucky few born in our realm with one tail,&quot; she said nervously. &quot;My name&#39;s Trisha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, turning his attention to the two human women in the room. The first appeared to be a woman in her late twenties. She looked tired, her long ebony hair falling past her shoulders with bags under eyes, she looked exhausted yet was now standing in front of a familiar looking woman in her late thirties who was angrily glaring at Trisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look familiar,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Elise&quot; she replied angrily, glaring at Trisha. &quot;And that little kitsune bitch is dead! I don&#39;t care how many wards they have to neutralize magic. I&#39;ll kill her with my bare hands!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Elise,&quot; Fukushu answered in confusion. &quot;I know of this wizard. You cannot be her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m from the Magic timeline,&quot; she answered. &quot;They call me Misery and I&#39;m about to show that fucking kitsune she made the biggest mistake of her life when she tried to kill my family!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I..was only doing my job,&quot; Trisha whimpered. &quot;Mr. Amberhill wasn&#39;t interested in your daughter, only the Hoti&#39;s I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Misery, getting in a fight here will only make things worse,&quot; the tired ebony haired woman stated. &quot;Just take a breath and relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll relax when I&#39;ve turned Trisha into a rug May,&quot; Misery exclaimed. &quot;Now let me go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu scowled, moving in front of Trisha as he locked eyes with Misery.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as I draw breath human no kitsune will be harmed in my presence,&quot; he growled. &quot;And unlike you, I do not need magic to carry out my threats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Misery please,&quot; May pleaded. &quot;Just relax okay? We still don&#39;t know why any of us are here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Misery grumbled, sitting down in a chair but continuing to stare daggers at Trisha. &quot;So does anyone know what we&#39;re doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can answer that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The quartet turned, Fukushu letting out an annoyed grunt as Jackie O&#39;Toole-Kirkman now entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here wizard,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Have you come to gloat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Fukushu I haven&#39;t,&quot; Jackie replied. &quot;I&#39;m here to help and to talk with all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The last time we spoke human you threatened to shave me bald,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;All because I did not wish your daughters to enter an active war zone. If I wanted to listen to the arrogance of humans I would have remained in my cell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stop please,&quot; Jackie sighed in annoyance. &quot;Look I get it, you hate humans! Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have said that okay, but you are the last one to start judging anybody. How much damage has your temper caused over not just the years but the centuries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu narrowed his brow, glaring at Jackie before taking a seat next to Trisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, say your peace human,&quot; he grumbled.<br />
<br />
Jackie took a breath, looking around at the patients S.P.E.A.R had asked her to rehabilitate. This was already going to be difficult, considering the volatile nature of three of them, yet Director Meyers felt it was necessary. After all, the four individuals within this room weren&#39;t necessarily evil, they were damaged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay look,&quot; Jackie began. &quot;The reason I&#39;m here is because S.P.E.A.R believes you four don&#39;t necessarily belong here. They think you can be rehabilitated. They want you to go through talk therapy to see if that could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Misery scoffed. &quot;The only thing that will help me is being with my daughter and granddaughter and turning that one tailed bitch into a smear on the wall!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to agree with the angry human,&quot; Fukushu added. &quot;I did not come to talk about my feelings but to atone for my sins. And I might add, any who attack my people will find themselves crushed beneath my heel, especially humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I actually think talk therapy works,&quot; May replied meekly. &quot;It helped me deal with....her. She&#39;s always whispering to me, telling me to burn things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to go home,&quot; Trisha moaned.<br />
<br />
Jackie sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. This was going to take awhile and until S.P.E.A.R was satisfied, she would be working to rehab a group of very damaged and deranged people.</p>
