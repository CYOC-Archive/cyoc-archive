<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at his mother&#39;s clothes, Connor felt a twinge of regret. He should have tried on clothes as a girl when he had the chance. He could have picked out an outfit from his mother&#39;s expansive wardrobe, or he could have just bought some outfits. His family was loaded. He had the money to spend on pretty clothes even if they were just to be used for a day. Maybe he could have gone out to town in a cute dress, showing off his lithe girly body, catching the eyes of men all around. Allen could have joined along. A romantic date, boyfriend and girlfriend, the big strong man protecting his cute little girl. <br />
<br />
He held a dress. He couldn&#39;t remember ever seeing his mother wear it. It was a pale blue color with faint floral patterns. It seemed lighthearted with its thin light airy fabric. His mom seemed too old for something like this. It looked like it would suit a playful girl. Maybe it would suit him?<br />
<br />
He heard the doorbell. Kendall must have arrived. Shit, what was he doing. He looked down. He had the dress halfway up his waist. He couldn&#39;t even get it up higher at the risk of ruining it. It just looked comical. This big jock trying to fit into this small dress. What was he even doing?<br />
<br />
He quickly got out of the dress and threw it into the closet. He&#39;d tidy it up properly later. It was time to be with Kendall. Hot sex with his girlfriend would surely take his mind off all this. Fucking girls, that was his element. It was what he lived for, and so it would be the perfect celebration of the return of his manhood. <br />
<br />
He rushed down to Kendall. It didn&#39;t take long until they were at it, fucking until they were both completely exhausted.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Connor was at the gym. He did some light warm ups. He didn&#39;t really want to start until Allen got here. After all this time, he could finally get a proper workout together with his bro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro! You&#39;re back!&quot; he heard Allen&#39;s voice excitedly exclaim.<br />
<br />
He turned to around. There was Allen. He wore a thin-strapped tank top. The tank top hung low. His pecs were on display, and they were large. His entire body was large, and aesthetically so, with every muscle sculpted. He had already learned this back when he and the Asian Adonis got intimate, but it wasn&#39;t just comparatively because of the small female body he had at that time. Allen still impressed the male Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s great to be back, bro.&quot; Connor replied.<br />
<br />
The two jocks had a long embrace, hard body against hard body. Connor couldn&#39;t help to feel excited, his penis hardening, tenting his underwear. These feelings were supposed to have dissipated. Why did he still feel so aroused when he looked at and touched Allen? These weren&#39;t just lingering memories. His male body still desired Allen. He had to calm down. This wasn&#39;t the time.<br />
<br />
Soon, the two were working out like they used to. They took turns bench pressing with the other person spotting. They did some friendly competition of who could lift the most. Connor tended to win whenever they did this, but this time Allen won by a landslide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen, is that a new record? When the hell did you get so strong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know bro. I&#39;ve just been on fire all week, and with you here back with me, I feel invincible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us two together.&quot; Connor muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still thinking of your time as a girl?&quot; Allen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I just-&quot; Connor left his sentence unfinished. He didn&#39;t know what to say. His head was a mess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it! I&#39;ll always be be there for you bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was Allen&#39;s words supposed to be reassuring? He didn&#39;t want to just be his &quot;bro&quot;, he wanted more, but could he risk it? Could he risk revealing what he felt? Would Allen even accept him afterwards? He couldn&#39;t hold back, he had to say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen, I like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He said it. He had said it. No going back now. It was laid bare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor.&quot; Allen started. &quot;You&#39;re my best bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor didn&#39;t like what he was hearing. This didn&#39;t seem like the start of what he&#39;d hoped for.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sex we had was the best I&#39;ve ever had. You were absolutely amazing, but it&#39;s just that I like girls. I can&#39;t help it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course he liked girls. Connor was a fool to think any different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I know that.&quot; Connor laughed. &quot;I just wanted to say how great you were, during all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all cool bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The workout continued. Allen didn&#39;t seem to be fazed by Connor&#39;s confession. He was as cheerful and joking as he always was. Connor couldn&#39;t help to get influenced. His mood improved, both by pumping iron and by spending time with Allen. He managed to keep his distress at bay.<br />
<br />
After a long fulfilling workout, Connor and Allen left the gym and went their separate ways. Just as Connor got alone, he became emotional. He couldn&#39;t deny it, not after saying it out loud. He liked Allen. He wanted Allen. What was he supposed to do?</p>
