<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angus Whitmore woke and shifted uncomfortably in his sleeping bag.  Damn.  he had to take a piss really bad.  Mark, his tent-mate, was snoring pretty loudly, and did not stop even when Angus crawled out of the tent.  He had no idea what time it was thanks to the ban on all electronic devices, but it was probably around 3 AM.  <br />
<br />
The camp was quiet except for various other snoring sounds.  Nobody had stayed up - you did not need to stand watch in Spring Lake.  He debated relieving himself on a nearby tree, but  reluctantly trudged out to the designated area about fifty yards from the camp.  There was plenty of moonlight, and he was surprised to see a swarm of fireflies  overhead.  Big ones.  They appeared to follow him as he made his way down the path, and hovered above him when he stopped and pulled open his boxers.  Angus gave a soft grunt of relief as he urinated, the hot liquid splashing on the leaves and grass.  Damn!  He should not have drunk so much water.<br />
<br />
As he relieved himself, he heard some noise off to the side.  Another Scout taking a leak?  Except there was movement on both sides now.  He held still, though the urine kept flowing.  Deer!  His momentary concern changed to curiosity as the animals ambled past, oblivious to the human.  Two, three, four does and a fawn.  How could they not see him?  Or at least smell the piss?  He finally finished, but remained still.  They were just a few feet away, so close he could reach out and touch a couple of them.  Then the fireflies dropped down and started flying around the deer&#39;s heads.  It was beautiful.  He wished he had a camera. <br />
<br />
One of the deer finally noticed him, but instead of bolting, she turned and approached him.  Angus remained still, having no reason to fear the creature, but not wanting to scare her off, either.  She was beautiful, her eyes liquid brown and her coat looking soft and warm.    Some of the fireflies started to flit around his head, and he forced himself not to wave them away.  Man, these things were huge!  It was weird - instead of buzzing, they made noises that almost sounded like high-pitched laughter.  He could not tear his eyes away from the doe, even with the distraction of the insects.  She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen!  The animal took another step forward, then stretched out her neck and licked the end of his nose.<br />
<br />
Angus gasped, feeling something almost like a shock.  Static electricity?  The sensation raced through his body, seeming to crackle out of his fingers and toes, and even his penis, which he realized was pounding erect.  He was surprised that his reaction had not frightened the animal off.  Instead, she seemed more interested in him.  Weren&#39;t deer usually afraid of humans?  Maybe they had gotten used to campers here.  He could understand how anyone who saw this doe would treat her kindly.  She was amazing, incredibly perfect.<br />
<br />
Something brushed his forehead - one of the lighting bugs.  He managed not to move even though more started to land briefly on his forehead, ears, and hair.  As long as they did not bite, he didn&#39;t want to risk scaring off the doe.  After a moment, she licked his nose again, creating a second shock.  The fireflies were all around them both now, and he could feel them on his back, his chest, his arms and legs, even on his now-swollen cock.    It was weird, but somehow not really bothering him.  Probably how most animals dealt with insects - the doe probably had ticks and fleas that she was aware of, but just accepted as normal.<br />
<br />
He had noticed the animal&#39;s scent when she got close, sweat and musk and pine.  Now it seemed a lot stronger, and somehow very appealing.  Angus grunted, the sound low in his throat and not really intentional.  He was so horny!  Part of him was amused at the thought of what he must look like - standing out here in his boxers, covered with fireflies, and sporting a raging boner with a  bunch of deer!  He grunted again, the sound odd to his ears, and he realized he had taken a step forward.  The doe turned suddenly, and he felt sudden and unexplainable despair that he had scared her off.  But no.  She squatted slightly and urinated in front of him, her tail flagged high and the dark folds of her cunt suddenly slick and swollen.  <br />
<br />
Angus stared, feeling confused.  He knew what the doe wanted, and would have laughed.  Except that he wanted to give her what she wanted.  Her odor filled his nostrils, and he was trembling slightly now with desire.  He grunted again, and felt off balance.  The fireflies were all over him, even on his cock and his butt, crawling all over his head.  Almost absently, he brushed at the ones over his eyes, only to have his fingers hit something that seemed attached to his forehead.  The fireflies swarmed suddenly, confusing him even more as he reached up and felt protrusions, almost like small branches emerging from his skull.  Then his fingers went numb, and he dropped his hands to see dark masses under dozens of fireflies, masses that shifted into cloven hooves.  <br />
<br />
The boy stared at what had been his hands dully, unable to get his mind clear enough to understand what was happening.  Antlers.  He had antlers.  He looked down and saw a barreled chest already covered with fur, and a sheathed cock that no longer belonged to a human.  Fireflies danced around him, and balance shifted again.  He grunted as he stumbled slightly, and found that he could no longer speak the words &#39;What&#39;s happening?&#39;  Even that was not enough to break the trance, and his thoughts focused on the female.  <br />
<br />
His body was still not quite right, legs not long enough, arms still bending the wrong way, neck too short.   But with a louder, more guttural grunt, Angus fell over the doe&#39;s back and thrust spasmodically.  It took a couple of tries to find her opening, but when he finally entered her his entire purpose for life became focused on the need to mate.  He shifted  over her, both grunting and snorting as they coupled, not-quite boy becoming not-quite deer, and as he shuddered in sudden release, completely the transformation into a young stag.  <br />
<br />
Angus remained over the female&#39;s back, ears pricked and nostrils quivering, alert for any threat.  But they were safe, only the fireflies buzzing harmlessly around them.  He could hear them clearly now, laughing and talking to each other - not that he could understand them, just that he knew they had language.  Not insects.  One came close to his liquid brown eye and he made out a humanoid shape, like a skinny boy with wings, but only a couple of inches tall.  Recognition flickered in a mind rapidly simplifying - fairy.  The fireflies were magical fae.  They had transformed him into a stag.  He was now an  animal, his human life lost forever.  <br />
<br />
The knowledge should have upset him over the far shorter lifespan, despairing over living the rest of his life as an animal in the wilderness.  Yet he simply accepted it all as normal and natural, even right, somehow.  He snorted and scented the air.  There were many humans nearby, and he felt threat from that.  Sliding off the female, he shook himself, then made his way towards the river.  They would drink there, and then move to safer, more remote woods higher up.   He stared back toward the human scents, curious flickers of memory confusing it.  Then even those faded away and the stag led his herd away.</p>
