<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neither of them could sleep.<br />
<br />
Kate wanted to spoon against Tom but she had too much pride to make the first move. Was it wrong of her to suggest Tom put on the nightie? She hadn’t been trying to embarrass him. That seemed to be how he had taken it. She had thought they might have had a little fun. Maybe she was a little bi-curious? She had never slept with another woman, in fact the thought had never really entered her mind until tonight. She was straight but all the same that was her husband on the other side of the bed, she wondered what it would feel like to snuggle up against his female body.<br />
<br />
Tom lay there wondering whether he had done the right thing or not. Kate’s huffing and storming off to change had made it clear she was disappointed in him. He was disappointed as well. He had been looking forward to another love making session. Kate had looked wonderful in the dress she had worn to dinner and then she had also purchased some new lingerie. He liked to think she had been looking forward to sex as well. <br />
<br />
He began to imagine what might have happened had he put the nightie on. Would they be cuddling now instead of both lying silently in bed pretending to be asleep? What would it feel like if Kate touched these breasts. Not that he could ask her to do that. He knew she was a heterosexual woman. She was probably disgusted by his current body. If Kate had become a man would Tom have been able to snuggle up against her? He didn’t think so.<br />
<br />
Tom had trouble getting comfortable. If he rolled onto his tummy his breasts got squashed. And his pajama top was a bit too tight. The damn things wobbled all the time. Also the material of his shirt felt so course and tickly against his nipples. Maybe that was why Kate had suggested he wear the nightie. The silk had felt so soft.<br />
<br />
Talking of nipples. They stuck out so much. It was almost like having a penis that wouldn’t go down. Well not quite. He missed having his penis. A hand wandered down and felt his flat empty groin. Well it wasn’t totally empty. He had a vagina. He tried to remember all the parts of a female. Kate had apparently fallen asleep. Certainly she hadn&#39;t moved in 10 minutes. Tom was curious. He hadn&#39;t had a chance to explore his new body.<br />
<br />
His hand slipped under the waistband of his PJ&#39;s. That was easy to do because it was so loose. His fingers located his slit. It was strange to have no pubic hairs, not as strange as have no penis or balls but strange all the same. There must have been a time when he didn’t have pubes but that was forgotten in all the years since puberty. <br />
<br />
Once more Tom tried to remember the names of the female parts. Not the crude names of fanny or cunt but the proper scientific names, he had to think back to sex education classes in high-school. Tom had to admit he had not paid a lot of attention. He did remember the names vulva and vagina. If he recalled correctly the vagina was the hole you stuck your dick into while the vulva was the whole thing. There were also names for the flaps of skin but for the life of him Tom could not remember what they were. Whatever they were called Tom’s fingers delved inside. He found the larger opening of what he guessed was his vagina and the tiny hole he had earlier peed out of. He pushed his finger knuckle deep into the vagina. He realised how moist he was.<br />
<br />
He did know the name clitoris and he knew that was her part that Kate liked him to stimulate. She would continually tell him to be gentle as he tended to get too vigorous. His fingers located what for tonight at least must be his very own clitoris. Mmm it was sensitive! Like the head of his dick just a lot smaller! <br />
<br />
Tom rolled onto his back so that he got freer access to his groin. His breasts again wobbled like two huge globs of jelly. Once more he was aware of his shirt rubbing against his nipples. <br />
<br />
He dipped his finger into his vagina again. This time he raised the finger to his nose and sniffed. He liked the smell, it was much like Kate’s smell but different. He then licked his finger. It tasted nice as well. It reminded him of eating out Kate. He always enjoyed that. Momentarily he imagined what it would feel like from her point of view. No don’t go there he told himself. Kate only rarely and reluctantly had ever licked his penis. She wouldn’t possibly be willing to lick his cunt. Don’t even ask. It would just be embarrassing.<br />
<br />
His hand returned to his groin. He realised he must have exuded a lot of juices. He was very wet now. Gently he stimulated his clitoris again, continually lubricating it with juices from his vagina. It felt so good.<br />
<br />
Kate knew very well what Tom was doing. She was pretending to be asleep but her mind was very focused on Tom. She didn’t think he was even aware of sounds he was emitting. His breaths sounded so different, so feminine. She could smell his juices as well. She rolled over so she could watch him opening her eyes just enough so he wouldn&#39;t know she was awake. There was just a hint of light coming through the curtains, which they had forgotten to close properly and her eyes had by now totally adjusted to the dark. <br />
<br />
Kate realised watching Tom masturbate was turning her on. She never liked him playing with his dick in her presence, always thinking his constant scratching of himself was disgusting. But now watching him explore his new parts was very much a turn on. She was getting wet herself. She wanted a bit of that finger action in her own crotch. Her own finger silently found its way to her own pussy. She felt the hairs and imagined what it would feel like if she was shaved – like Kerry, like Tom at the moment. She wondered if Tom would let her touch his new parts? Probably not. He had been unwilling to put on a nightie. Pity. She was curious. Maybe she could shave herself smooth? <br />
<br />
She found it amusing how Tom was whimpering. Her husband was making very girly sounds. He must be close. She was stimulating her own clit but was very careful not to give that fact away to Tom. Then again Tom had probably forgotten that she was in the bed beside him.<br />
Tom’s writhing reached a crescendo. Kate guessed he had reached his climax. Then she heard him get out of the bed. He didn’t go to the ensuite bathroom but left the bedroom to the hall, closing the door behind himself.<br />
<br />
Kate now had the privacy she wanted and began to work on her clitoris with a bit more vigour.</p>
