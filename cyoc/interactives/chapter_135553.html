<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The entire gist of the restaurant was quick to pick up, abbreviations such as “Dyn R” for Dynamite Rolls and “V Temp” for vegetable Tempora greeted Eliza’s billbook whenever a new table came in and it was her turn to take them.  Thankfully no one here shouted in Japanese. They may have looked like they moved from Japan yesterday but one of the cooks had a clear American accent and none of the accents were thick.<br />
<br />
What really grabbed Eliza’s attention during the shift were the customers. She’d drop off their order and whenever she checked back they’d be changing just like she had, except never in quite the same way.<br />
<br />
The four guys roughly her age had a sushi boat with a variety of rolls on it and every time Eliza went back she had to stare at them. There was a blonde guy and a man with frizzy red hair on the end of the booth and a guy with brown hair and another who was bald against the far end. The first time Eliza went back to check on them they’d all changed. The redhead and the bald guy had begun changing rather drastically. Their height was lower and their bodies were starting to shift into those of women. Breasts had begun to emerge and their voices had become more high pitched. Meanwhile the two men clearly remaining men had undergone different changes. The man closest to the edge had become harrier and his clean shaven face had begun to show stubble around the moustache area. Eliza tried not to stare but found herself watching from across the restartaunt as the man staying close to the wall began to get younger and the two women finished their change into ladies. Then when she went by with water the girl near the wall also began to get younger. Meanwhile the two adults began to get older. She just watched as over the course of a meal four friends changed into a family of four. Everyone’s hair darkened to black and their features changed to distinctly Japanese. Signs of having given birth emerges on the wife’s body. Her breasts enlarged and sagged a little, grown by pregnancy and sagged slightly from breastfeeding. The father sported a clear moustache and his daughter gained a downsized version of his nose. She looked to be about ten or twelve while her brother stopped at about five or six. The family continued to speak english as the wife’s hair became somewhat messy and sweaty and tired bags emerged beneath her eyes almost like she got off an incredibly long shift. She also gained a distinctive sanitized smell mixed with formaldehyde that Eliza recognized from hospitals. The man on the other hand gained a wafting scent of paper, ink, and coffee almost like he worked in an office of some kind. In the meantime their kids gained clothes that fit them, so they weren’t just running off hand me downs from friends and had at least enough wealth to buy clothes for their kids.<br />
<br />
Eliza just stared blankly at them while they left and couldn’t believe her eyes, a bunch of white college kids had become ethnic Japanese people. It was baffling and if it had been the only thing she’d seen that night maybe she would have stared more.<br />
<br />
A brother and sister walked in while the family was changing. It was clear the sister was in charge and her brother was a little brat. He tried to order soda and she wouldn’t let him do he threw a fit. His whines could be heard across the restaraunt as Eliza put their order in. Soon after it arrived they began to change. She stared at them as with each bite of food they seemed to change ages. The girl became younger and the boy became older. Suddenly his whining stopped and he asked for soda. His sister proclaimed that mom had said “No pop,” but the cheeky teen asked for the pop on a separate bill and fed her some to shut her up. A rule breaking teenage boy and his rule following younger sister left the restaurant with questions of what it would take to keep her from telling mom if he had a party flying through the air.<br />
<br />
Another table featured an incredibly overweight man sauntering into the restaurant and waiting patiently. He was all sweaty and done up in a nice shirt and dark pants. He was tall too and had a bright smile on his face. Friendliest guy on the planet. However after an hour of waiting that smile fell and he got a rather depressed look on his face. Eliza came over and the guy just seemed to break and ordered a plethora of unhealthy things, the statement of just drinking water from earlier forgotten as he got a jug of pop brought to him and ordered the rolls with deep fried stuff in them. He munched on these sadly and as Eliza watched he began to lose weight. It melted off him with each roll he ate and the soda stopped being drunk. His waist shrunk so much that it suddenly popped inwards in a feminine way. A perfect hourglass figure while his hips and ass suddenly popped out becoming sexy and wide, the kind men drooled over, then breasts exploded from his chest, large and alluring, while his hair fell down and became stylish and red. Green eyes blinked and his skin smoothed out as hairs and blemishes vanished. She was an alluring redhead and her beat up car outside shrunk and transformed into a absolutely gorgeous motorcycle. She finished eating and Eliza cleared the plates and brought her water. By the time she came back the sexy redhead’s clothes had shifted into a nice leather jacket and deep blue jeans bottomed with biking boots with a slight heel. She flipped her hair back letting the cascade of gorgeous red flow down her back and her perfect makeup was actually turning Eliza on.<br />
<br />
She remained there alone and Eliza somehow lost the bill. It didn’t matter though as her other table, a friendly man with the cheapest rolls he could buy suddenly began turning into a hottie of the other gender. Muscles plucked up to beautiful and chiseled levels and his body suddenly smelled clean. His clothes turned designer and an air of wealth began to waft from him. When he finished his receipt also went blank and he got up and sat with the sexy redhead. They began talking like a dating couple and ordered as if they hadn’t already eaten.<br />
<br />
Once their new food arrived Eliza paid close attention to any changes but all that shifted was their conversation becoming more familiar and rings emerging on their fingers. She smiled as they walked out, her hand squeezing his ass and got onto motorcycles before driving off. Eliza watched them go and returned to work, happy that the changes tonight had been for the better and wondering if turning her into an employee at the restaurant was good for her in the long run.</p>
