<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suzanne groggily lifted her head to catch the sun's morning rays filtering through the dusty window on the right, creating dancing spots of gold on the red checkered quilt that Suzanne had kept pulled all around her through the night.  It wasn't a cold night, and the morning already felt particularly warm, despite the little digital clock on the night stand only reading 7:58 a.m.<br />
<br />
She felt small in the queen size bed, but could easily see her gigantic feet poking straight up under the covers.  She pulled them out and fingered them.  The night's sleep seemed to have calmed her mind a bit, and she was ready to face whatever changes were happening, and to try and pull through and find the loophole that the leprachaun had promised would break the spell and restore her.<br />
<br />
Her toes were massive, and she had to use both of her hands to fit them around her large feet.  They strangely didn't feel heavy or abnormal to her now.  They were almost a source of fascination, and she could now see little pricks of dark, coarse, and very thick hair creeping out of her skin.  She examined every inch of the feet: the tops, bottoms, ankles, and toes, finding the same little hairs everywhere.  They were definately going to be a lot hairier than in the movies, just as Nick had said.<br />
<br />
She again lifted her shirt, running her hand over her abdomen, pressing through the fine layer of fat to feel the toned muscles underneath.  &quot;Sit-ups are definately in order,&quot; she said aloud to no one but herself.  As if on cue, her stomach growled loudly just as she'd finished those words.  She definately felt hungry again, perhaps even a bit more than yesterday!  She told her stomach to wait just a few a little more and gave it a final pat.<br />
<br />
Finally, she brought her fingers up to her hair and ears.  She could feel more definate points now.  Her ears seemed to have grown overnight as well.  Swirling around them were locks of slighty curled hair.  It hung barely to her shoulders, and she hoped it was just her bedhead that made it feel so loose and wild beneath her fingertips.<br />
<br />
Her stomach gave a final growl and Suzanne slowly got to her feet, instinctively measuring how high she stood compared to the rest of the room.  Her clothes felt a bit baggier yet and she had to adjust the safety pin, but the actual loss of height didn't seem that dramatic.  At least, it wasn't like yesterday when she lost quite a few inches in a short timeframe!<br />
<br />
She brought her hand to the doorknob, taking note of how much higher she now had to reach in order to open doors (up to her ribs now), and noticing the intricate design on the metal doorknob.  It was a silver knob with leaves embossed in its sides and a tree in the center.  Custom made, she figured.<br />
<br />
The door creaked open as she exited and she shuffled down the carpeted hallway.  She figured that the soles of her feet had grown harder, as the carpet didn't feel nearly as scratchy as it previously had, athough walking itself felt much more awkward.  It felt as though she was bouncing up and down due to the size of her feet, and she vaguely wondered how tall she stood on her tiptoes.<br />
<br />
She got downstairs to see Nick sitting at his desk and working feverishly on a program.  Several books were open in front of the computer, most of them programming books, and he was always glancing between them and the screen, not even noticing Suzanne, and perhaps not even noticing the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Suzanne's nostril flooded with the smell of ham as it roasted in the kitchen.  She glanced beyond the living room and peered in through the small window on the door.  The kitchen was large, and looked like it belonged in a five-star hotel instead of in Nick's house.  Her hunger almost got the best of her, but Nick suddenly looked up from his work and caught his guest peering in at breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Suzanne jumped at the sudden sound and spun around.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got some clothes ready for you,&quot; Nick continued, thrusting a pile of garments into her arms.  &quot;You probably won't like them, but they're bound to be much more comfortable than what you're wearing now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Suzanne rushed into the bathroom.  She held the smaller shirt in front of her, noticing the little NASCAR logo on it, and the pants had suspenders, which she hardly ever wore.  It didn't matter much to her, and she put it on, examining her look in the mirror.  &quot;I look like a redneck,&quot; she thought, but at least they fit.  Her sides definately did look bigger, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope you like your eggs easy,&quot; Nick called as she proceeded into the kitchen.  He was busy setting the oak table, a huge ham placed right in the center.  &quot;I figured I should make it big, since Hobbits love breakfast a lot.  I even made tea!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Suzanne soon found herself sitting at a table and sipping tea with her breakfast.  She wolfed down the eggs within a minute, having smeared the yoke all over her toast.  She also gorged herself on nearly the entire ham, leaving only a small amount for Nick, who really didn't seem to mind.  He watched her from accross the long table with a gentle fascination.  It wasn't in a stalker sort of way, but in a way that didn't take Suzanne out of her comfort zone.<br />
<br />
At the end, she shoved back from the table, feeling her bloated stomach and wondering how she'd ever be able to eat again.  She knew that she'd be hungry before too long, and she dreaded that feeling, but at least she was with someone who would understand her needs and not grimace at her.  She looked down at the floor and wondered how long she could stand this life, regardless of whether she had an understanding companion or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we start now, we can probably finish the last two films!&quot; Nick suddenly exclaimed, a big, bright smile once again stretching accross his thin face.</p>
