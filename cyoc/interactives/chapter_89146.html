<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer looks around her room and notices her TV showing a report on the decreasing amount of violence and illegal activies in the city as she smirks to herself, i got it, Kyle, youre to become a prostitute. Kyle gasps as he looks over at his friend and tells them to leave the room and go home, L-look, Jennifer i was just joking right? Jennifer shrugs, i don’t really care Kyle, you&#39;ve been a dick for so long i think that’s fair, bye bye and have fun. She hangs up as Kyle tries to call her back but nothing, he sits down on his computer chair and looks at the black screen, nothing seems to be happening but he can feel it inside him. He screams loudly and shots up from the chair as an incredible pain can be felt rushing through his legs and up his body, his whole body feels like it&#39;s on fire, he almost falls right back down but manages to keep his balance and takes a sip of water he has on the table. He stands up and walks over to the bathroom and splashes his face with some water the pain is still unbearable, he looks up at the mirror and notices his hair is growing longer as he speaks what the hell? did...did it seriously work ?his hair grows longer as it stops just below his shoulder and goes from his regular dark brown to a shiny patina blonde color. He starts panicking and tries to open his door as he notices his nails have turned long and has a bright red color, his whole arm looks pretty different, all the hair is gone and the whole arm looks silky smooth with small feminine hands. Oh my god, this can’t be happening! he picks up his cellphone and quickly texts jenny to call him back,  he gets no reply at first but his phone buzzes saying she will call him up in 10 minutes as she is about to eat her breakfast.  He sighs and looks back up at the mirror. He takes a deep sigh of relief as the pain is now gone but his face...he can see it right in the mirror his own face changing, his eyes turns bright blue and starts growing long eyelashes, his lips turns full with bright red lipstick and his whole face turns smaller and more feminine, oh my god...i..My  voice? his voice is high pitched and feminine, he looks away from the  only to realize he is getting smaller, he is actually shrinking! oh dear…this is unbelievable, he can still see the mirror as he feels the pain rushing back, its all over him now but instead of it feeling like he is on fire it now feels like something inside him is being ripped apart, he holds tightly around his chest as he tries to hold back the tears.  Just as the pain came back it vanished, he moved his arms from his chest, his pants now down on his feet and the tv shirt hanging loosely around him he decides to take them both of them just standing there in his boxers. Kyle gasped as he looked back in the mirror and down at his chest as two small lumps had started to protrude out from his body,  oh god no, they kept getting bigger and bigger til they stopped at around a C-cup. Oh my god…this is to much, he feels faint as he staggers back to his bedroom and falls down on the bed. He can his eyes turning heavy and everything going black but just about as he is about to pass out he is interrupted by the sound of the phone buzzing he quickly picks it up and looks at the caller id, its Jennifer. <br />
Answers the phone, J-jennifer! Kyle ?  is that you ? you sound all different ? she giggles to herself, I have to admit I didn’t think it was real but I guess I was wrong I mean I know you did it to me but I mean like that. Fair enough look, you gotta sto-..Kyle stops talking and stands up as he notices he is missing some parts down there, he quickly glides his hand over his boxers and nothing there ? Kyle hearts Jennifer laughing on the other side, this is what you get you little creep, have fun and don’t ever call me back again kylie or whatever. She hangs up, Kyle stands up and hurries to the bathroom and gets out a smaller mirror as he takes of his boxers to confirm what he already knows, Kyle closes his eyes and moves the mirror down opening them back up once its in place and just sighs,  I can’t belive this…he sighs deeply and sits down on the floor and starts sobbing as everything around him turns to black. <br />
Kyle wakes up 10 minutes later lying on his bed, he sits up and looks around, the room is now full of  clothes littering the floor, a large wardrobe, a sofa and his computer is now just a small laptop,  Kylie sits up and walks out of the bed and notices this huge mirror leaning against the wall like it was just put up, Kyle walks over to it and gasps, above the mirror there is written in huge pink letters  -Katherine-  Katherine ? he looks confused but thinks not much of it as he notices his clothes, he is wearing a thight leather jacket with a white fur collar, leather pants, he also notices some black glossy pumps on the floor. I…cant belive it…Im…Ky…he stops for a second and looks at the mirror again then at the name, Katherine ? but…his head starts to hurt as new memories starts taking place over  The old ones, replacing each single one,  going to school, friends, family, everything fades away being replaced with new ones, she remembers her first kiss in fourth grade by this kid named Steven, her first day at school, growing up, that one kid at school she had a crush on and so on, kyle’s memories are still there somewhat but they are just there, they  aren’t hers, just some fake memories she must have dreamt up or something. Katherine smiles and checks her phone as she heads out and gets ready for a long night.</p>
