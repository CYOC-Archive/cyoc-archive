<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Froid put his two fingers on his chin, and thought for a moment. However soon he seemed to get an idea and he looked down at you and grinned,&quot;We should probably go up to our room and make love to one another, eggs are what declares a marriage in my kingdom after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed and covered your mouth a bit shocked by his suggestion. You glanced over at Janice, who just stood there silently looking from you to Froid.<br />
<br />
&quot;What’s wrong? Does my betrothed not wish to truly become what she was made to be?&quot; Froid asked<br />
<br />
You paused stuttering over your words as a nervous feeling washed over you. &quot;I-Isn’t it a b-bit early for th-that? I m-mean I j-just met you a-and...&quot; You began but then Froid placed a finger over your snout and shushed you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh, it’s okay to be nervous, it is your first time after all. Trust me, the sooner our bodies join together and plant the seeds of parenthood in your womb you’ll feel much better about that body of yours.&quot; Froid said taking both of your hands into his, and pressing your palms against his,&quot;At the very least you’ll know what to expect from yours truly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Froid then nuzzled you on the snout and planted a small kiss on your forehead. You then looked to Janice, who smiled at you reassuringly and smiled back. So you turned back to Froid and said,&quot;I... don’t really know how to do it, but sure, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this Froid&#39;s smile grew wider and genuine, and he wrapped his arms around you to give you a large and caring hug. You embraced him back and leaned into his muscular chest feeling safe, loved, and a tad bit aroused. <br />
<br />
When the two of you stopped Janice walked up and bowed to the two of you and said,&quot;Apologies, but what should I do in the absence of you while you enjoy your privacy together?&quot;<br />
<br />
Froid paused for a moment then he slithered up to Janice and handed her a gold coin. &quot;You shall wait in the room next to us, perhaps tidy it up if it needs to. If someone asks just show them this, they’ll know what it means and leave you alone.&quot; He explained then turned back to you and reached out an arm and said,&quot;Shall we?&quot; You again smiled at Froid and took his hand eagerly, and he proceeded to take you into the palace.<br />
<br />
The palace was amazing to observe, and its architecture looked mostly Egyptian in a way, except there were no stairs only paths that inclined upwards and spiraled up to new floors. The walls were adorned in decorative serpentine drawings and carvings, and the rooms seemed to all be separated by drapes instead of doors. However a few rooms seemed to have doors, one of which Froid slithered up to alongside you.<br />
<br />
He then looked back to Janice and said,&quot;This is where we part ways for now. You may rejoin my wife when either one of us exits the room, we won’t take too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice looked to Froid and replied,&quot;By all means, take as much time as you need, you don’t need to worry about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Froid smiled at this and motioned to one of the rooms to the side of the door, and Janice walked off. He then turned back to you smiling and asked,&quot;What do you think of our new home?&quot;<br />
<br />
You continued looking around admiringly at the surroundings until he looked at you. &quot;It’s...unbelievable, everything looks so...exotic and unique. I don’t really have any words to describe how I feel about this. I am however curious, why do most rooms only have curtains and so few have doorways?&quot; You replied <br />
<br />
Froid nodded at this and replied,&quot;The doors section off some of the private quarters for servants or special guests. However this room right here was prepared specifically for my own private means with a certain cobra seductress in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed feeling flattered by him and giggled a bit nervously by his comment. Froid then opened the door and gestured you inside and said,&quot;By all means my dearest bride, enter into my humble den.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to him blushing then slithered on inside making sure that your enormous snake tail got through the doorway before Froid entered. &quot;I could get used to this.&quot; You thought to yourself as Froid followed after you inside.<br />
<br />
You looked around the room and noticed the velvety carpeted floor, as well as a small table in the corner of the room with a cactus with a bright pink flower budding on it. The only light source was the window pouring in natural desert sunlight from the outside. However in place of a normal bed you saw that the majority of the room was circular shaped, and the walls around this circle were aligned with ornate looking pillows and the floor looked like it was one huge velvety cushion from wall to wall.<br />
<br />
Froid slithered to your side and said,&quot;Why don’t you get comfortable while I set the mood?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled at him and said,&quot;Sure thing, but...I&#39;m still a bit nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry, just relax and let me do the work. Just do what come naturally to you, and release those inner passions for love.&quot; Froid hissed in a deep and seductive tone.<br />
<br />
You of course nodded to him and slithered on over to the large circular bed and coiled up inside of it, awaiting Froid we you watched him from where you were. He slithered over to the window and pulled some thick draped over it to block out all of the sunlight. The room was pitch black until you heard two fingers snap and all around the room candles hanging from gold pedestals lit up, giving the room a romantic style of lighting.<br />
<br />
Froid then smiled down at you and approached you slowly and hissed,&quot;There we are, breeding is sacred so everything should be as perfect as possible, wouldn’t you agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled back and nodded to him slowly then hissed seductively,&quot;I know I&#39;m starting to feel in the mood right now. At least, I&#39;m pretty sure I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Froid chuckled at this, and he coiled himself up the best he could next to you before slowly making his way overtop of both of your coils and looking your torso from your head to your slit. You were doing the same to him feeling almost entranced by his muscular body, and his sheath as he slithered closer.<br />
<br />
You then picked your torso up upright as Froid approached you and took your hands once more. You stared into each other’s eyes smiling for a few moments before either of you spoke. &quot;Do you have a name now, my sexy cobra queen?&quot; He asked<br />
<br />
You smiled and nodded to him then said,&quot;Tonya, is that good enough my muscular prince?&quot; You blushed feeling awkward for commenting on his physique until he pulled you in for another hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as it’s yours, I don’t care if it’s the most hideous name in existence.&quot; Froid whispered to you and you looked up at him pulling back ever-so slightly to peer into his eyes again.<br />
<br />
It was then a rush of passion entered your veins and you hastily wrapped your hands around Froid&#39;s head and kissed him as passionate as your body screamed, claiming his mouth as yours as your tongue entered it and explored its crevices. Froid at first was caught off guard, but he soon returned your kiss and you felt his tongue in your mouth now as you fell backwards onto your own coils with him on top of you.<br />
<br />
Froid grinned as he pulled away from your mouth, and you paused as you felt two large appendages prod the very top of your vaginal slit. You looked down curiously to see two massive reptilian cocks, each roughly 1 foot in length and you blushed just by looking at them. Froid smiled at this and hissed,&quot;I have courted women before and denied many. No woman has had the passion to make a move like that before on me. No woman has surprised me like you have either, and I believe you’re the first woman to turn me on like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled and giggled some feeling flattered. &quot;Other women? Does that mean I’m the best?&quot; You asked sticking your tongue out teasingly and Froid laughed at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh by far,&quot; He laughed,&quot;At least the most interesting one I&#39;ve met in all my years. But let’s not ruin this with chatter, are you ready now?&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt now a bubbling heat emerge from your pussy as Froid said this, and it made you horny, really horny. So you nodded to him, and laid back to expose yourself to him entirely and you started panting. Froid noticed this and hissed,&quot;Ah yes, in that case let us not waste any time.&quot; Froid then brought his body back upright and held both of his hemipenes together erect in his hands, positioning them t the entrance to your needy pussy.<br />
<br />
You smiled panting more and more until you felt Froid make a powerful thrust into your sex, and the feeling of his cocks penetrating your cunt made you let out a hiss of nostalgic lust. &quot;Ooh god! This feels....amazing!&quot; You moaned and Froid smirked before pushing deeper and hissed,&quot;You’re so tight, but I love a challenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
You moaned louder feeling your pussy get pushed wide open by the snake&#39;s twin cocks, and you watched his arms come around your body and pull you in to a tight hug which pulled his cock in further until you felt them hit the back of your pussy, and you screamed as loud as you could climaxing for the first time as a female creature. Froid also let yelled loudly and you felt his throbbing cocks expel his seed into your unprotected womb and you orgasmed once more with a hiss as this happened.<br />
<br />
You now felt weak, and a you allowed yourself to lay limp. You smiled up at Froid until he turned on his side and said,&quot;You’re one hell of a cobra, my lovely wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
You giggled then blushed and replied,&quot;Thank you, you don’t know how much that means to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonya, you’re body is fit for a goddess.&quot; Froid commenter then you hugged him tightly, squeezing your breasts up against his body and said,&quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt yourself blush a bright red now as you said this, and you felt nervous about saying it so soon; You both just met after all. However, you felt Froid’s hand stroke your head and the back of your neck and he kissed your forehead then replied,&quot;I love you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you stayed in that position for quite some time, and you snuggled up to Froid as much as you could, but your eyelids grew heavy to the point where you could barely stay awake. Froid then leaned in and whispered,&quot;It’s okay to fall asleep, I&#39;ll send Janice for you.&quot; You slowly nodded to Froid at this and closed your eyes and slowly drifted off into slumber.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
You woke up and yawned stretching your arms and back as you looked down at yourself and grasped your breasts. &quot;It’s gonna be odd waking up to these every day now.&quot; You thought as you yawned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Lady Tonya, you’re awake.&quot; A voice said, and you turned to see...</p>
