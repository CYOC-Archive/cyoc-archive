<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Across the country, night had long set in on the east coast, and while unaware on what the full drama going on Moon Lake was at the moment, Theodore Green was able to settle back into some private sense of safety. The visit and time in Moon Lake was big for him and his wife, as it let them be together in every way after finally finding a were that wasn&#39;t from an exclusively female were-species that would transform him. Once he became a weretiger, he&#39;d been able to release the passion that had always been there for Marci, but could never be exercised because of her being a werecat. He&#39;d gotten some sense that she&#39;d had a lot of longing passion built up over their marriage as well, but he found nothing wrong with that.<br />
<br />
His greatest point of worry had more to do with his work for the FBI, for while most agents probably wouldn&#39;t notice because they didn&#39;t work with him that much, those that were on the team he worked with could well notice. He&#39;d joined the agency in his youth and shortly before he first met Marci. Some of the people he&#39;d initially worked with had retired by now as he&#39;d rose through the ranks, but the people that he did work with weren&#39;t stupid and he&#39;d feared that they would recognize some of the changes that had happened to him after becoming a weretiger. And there were clear differences.<br />
<br />
He was a bit taller now than he was as a normal human and his facial features looked like he was back in his twenties again. The hair that he had lost had grown back and it&#39;d regained its original color and luster, all things that the others would notice. There was also the obvious gain in muscle mass that he&#39;d put on as well, going from a reasonably fit man in his early to mid forties to looking like a champion Olympic wrestler in his twenties that he was sure would create some issues. For while certain parts of his mind understood that things would be easier without the were-secret on certain levels, he&#39;d seen enough crime scenes that gave him enough fear that if humanity found out about weres, he&#39;d lose Marci. Learning she was a werecat had a surprise when she first told him, but even that had been after a fairly lengthy period of time together.<br />
<br />
The people Teddy worked with didn&#39;t have that same level of emotional bond that he had with Marci, and thus brought in the fear that misconceptions about weres would come into play if he was honest. At the same time, some of their discussed options for explaining Teddy&#39;s changes had also been the sort that Teddy couldn&#39;t be sure they would actually buy them. For the men Teddy worked with were smart enough to note the differences and with the occasional Christmas party that they&#39;d had in the past, they knew enough of Marci to get the sense that she wouldn&#39;t be the type to be super vain in urging him to have some cosmetic surgery done. As such, they could only play that one day at a time and see how the went.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, by that Wednesday night, as both readied themselves for bed, there had been some progress on that front that they were still talking over...<br />
<br />
&quot;See... I told you things would be fine,&quot; Marci said encouragingly to her husband, &quot;no complaints...&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy turned to see his wife lay some her clothes from the day in the laundry hamper that was in their room. For the moment, it left him with a view of her in just her underwear as they readied themselves for bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if it was &quot;no complaints&quot; and simply not asking too much of a superior officer,&quot; Teddy answered, &quot;and most of the questions that were asked were short and non-serious... So they weren&#39;t going to go into things too deeply.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which sounds good,&quot; Marci smiled as she turned, &quot;the people you&#39;ve worked with trust you and won&#39;t pester you too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy nodded as he slipped out of his shoes and placed them down by the wall. As he shifted focusing on unbuttoning his shirt, he noticed Marci&#39;s bra being dropped into the laundry hamper out of the corner of his eye. He swallowed before he managed to issue a real answer as he felt some other stirrings start to rise almost immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but they&#39;re still smart and may notice,&quot; Teddy warned, &quot;and because of how secretive were society has been... I can&#39;t be sure as to whether or not they were already aware of weres and are supportive or would be supportive. And all of us have had enough experience with crime scenes and violent criminals... Lionel Ulysses being the latest of them... if they are anti-were... they&#39;d be tough to convince without revealing everything. And as yet... I&#39;m not sure anyone is ready for all that. Which means we&#39;ll have to be on egg shells. If they don&#39;t ask... there&#39;s no immediate problem... but that wouldn&#39;t necessarily mean they can&#39;t ask again later.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time it was Marci&#39;s turn to nod as Teddy removed his shirt and she could notice the tent beginning to form in her husband&#39;s pants. For the moment, that made her smile, as now that her husband was a weretiger, it was something both of them could truly enjoy, but for the moment they were still catching up on some other things. She quietly walked to her side of the bed and climbed in, shifting herself underneath the sheets while Teddy took the clothes that he couldn&#39;t wear again tomorrow to the laundry hamper.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may just have to be careful there,&quot; Marci admitted, &quot;but... if they give you no trouble with it... there will be NO trouble in the long run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Teddy said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime... any new cases? Something to surprise you?&quot; Marci inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing that I&#39;ve seen come in has been something that comes off a bit like a sort of arson case... the police units that called us in have come from Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware with reports of things being burned into people&#39;s lawns,&quot; Ted gave a sigh, &quot;and it&#39;s come to us because a few traffic stop cameras have caught the same vehicle in the general area where the fires were set either shortly before or shortly after... but beyond that, the local cops aren&#39;t quite sure and my team has only been just going over the initial reports. Beyond that I can&#39;t say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... my greatest hero will always save the day,&quot; Marci smiled as Teddy returned to the bed and climbed in under the covers. The scent of his arousal growing as her mind happily went back to their first meeting. True she didn&#39;t necessarily like being pursued by someone she thought understood what &quot;no&quot; meant, but in meeting Ted and ultimately marrying him, her heart always seemed to tell her that their meeting was a gift, and now the two of them could enjoy everything that came from it together. There was also the side issue of wanting a family of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope to...&quot; Teddy managed with a small kiss and leaned over to kiss the woman he loved, &quot;and how have things gone with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly well...&quot; Marci smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any idea...&quot; Teddy began as he moved one hand forward to tough his wife&#39;s smooth skin while she was in her human form. Her stomach was presently flat and toned, though given some desires that had been there as part of the build up to his entrance into were society, that could soon change. The two of them had wanted a family, but because a normal human male having sex with a werecat would only kill that normal human couldn&#39;t take the specific female only strand of the were-virus, a family was only a dream for them. Because it had taken them years to ultimately find a way to enable Teddy to become a were, Marci didn&#39;t really keep track of when she was in heat, as if Teddy couldn&#39;t... there was no need to follow it.<br />
<br />
Then came the trip to Moon Lake. Teddy got the chance to become a were and became the very sort of were she&#39;d envisioned, a white weretiger. He was striking and powerful, and the perfect father for the children she&#39;d longed for years to have. For the moment, the pair of them were young enough that it was possible for others to expect Marci to get pregnant. If they waited much longer, while people might understand Marci aging gracefully, becoming pregnant would be different. Thus once they took the trip to Moon Lake, Marci didn&#39;t take her birth control pills with the hope that she would be in heat and that the hot and heavy time that she&#39;d had with her now weretiger husband would be enough to put a bun in the oven.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;m pregnant...&quot; Marci sighed as she felt her husband&#39;s hand slide over her stomach, &quot;while weres may be more fertile than normal humans... confirming whether or not I&#39;m pregnant may not be as easy. If I knew for sure I was in heat... I could give some adequate assumption... and if we were in Moon Lake and the tests could be made with the assumption of were hormones, it might be possible. The tests for normal humans could work... but the full confirmation on that might not be as accurate and might take time before they&#39;d be accurate. Such as when most normal women would be able to tell when they&#39;re pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But isn&#39;t technology advancing?&quot; Teddy asked trying to sound hopeful, as he&#39;d wanted a family for a while, and why their apartment technically had a room that could easily be set up as a separate bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know... I studied the law, not medicine,&quot; Marci answered and then smiled, &quot;but I&#39;d be up for trying to make certain that we will have a family... if my tiger would be more than willing to try... so long as we can keep the noise down...&quot;<br />
<br />
Teddy smiled back and came closer...</p>
