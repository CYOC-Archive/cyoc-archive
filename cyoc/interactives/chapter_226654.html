<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Watching this group of young teens, Aloe&#39;la was surprised by the diverseness of Sparks friends. Of the 12 assembled teenagers, half were human. The others varied, to which fairy spy found unusual. A nightmare demon. A deer woman,. A dhamphir. A demigod. That two fairies would associate with any of them was something no one within the realm of the fae would anticipate. Perhaps this was why Queen Glitter was so ecstatic about Sparks relationship. <br />
<br />
As the teens now made their way towards their vehicles, Aloe&#39;la noted the fairy sisters enter the Moreland boys car. Still suspect of Starlight’s prospective beau, the fairy quickly shrank, her skin returning to its natural blue as her damaged wings emerged from her back. She would follow and observe. Quickly she now flew to the roof, hiding among the shadows as the car drove away. As she now secretly hitched a ride, it allowed the fairy to think of her history with the sisters, especially Spark.<br />
<br />
When it came to the green fairy, their had always been sore feelings on Aloe&#39;la&#39;s part. When Spark joined the military forces, the fairy spy had already entrenched herself as a reliable soldier for Arion. With his daughters arrival though, a professional resentment began to fester. Arions daughter was brash, boisterous, perhaps a bit too impulsive for Aloe&#39;la taste. Still, her father seemd to look out for her, Aloe&#39;la believing she was given preferential treatment based solely on her father&#39;s reputation. It angered the fairy when Spark received recognition for her role in the War of the Winter Court. Yes, Spark had successfully won a battle and even saved her soldiers lives but, it was due to information Aloe&#39;la had provided. When Spark had received the Star of the Summer Court, one of the highest military honors of the fairy army, Aloe&#39;la had seethed. &quot;All of us know the work you have done is invaluable,&quot; Arion had told her. &quot;But the work of a spy is one done in the shadows. I am forever grateful but your work will be judged quietly by those who know and appreciate your talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aloe&#39;la frowned thinking of Arions words. It was true, to do her job as well as she could she could never be publicly honored. It didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t rewarded though, her actions during the war had given her the most esteemed position in the faes intelligence network. She had the ear of the queen, was as respected as much as Arion if not more. Still, she wished to be seen by her people for all the work she had done.<br />
<br />
As respected as she was though, her opinion on humans always fell on deaf ears. Aloe&#39;la chalked it up to Queen Glitters own experience with humans, as well as the long standing relationship with the Morelands. Nova&#39;lee&#39;s family for centuries served hunters yet Aloe&#39;la was wary of them, especially after Nova retired. The incident with Ezekiel Kane butchering a guardian fairy before Spark entered a union with Jacob Moreland had caused a rift amongst fairies. Some saw it as an afront to the treaty between hunters and fairies. Hunters knew better and that one would act in such a vile manner made some question humans as a whole. Aloe&#39;la had been firmly on that side, especially since the butchered fairy was a former pupil of hers. In the end, Queen Glitter overruled the dissenters. Spark became the Guardian of the Morelands and everything turned out for the best. <br />
<br />
As the car now slowed, Aloe&#39;la was shaken from her thoughts. Quickly flying into the shadows, she watched as Starlight and her date exited the car. It still seemed so odd that Star would be infatuated with this boy. He had barely taken his first steps into manhood, his body thin and gangly with a face showing only the barest hints of maturity. This also meant Stars physical form resembled the boy, the auburn haired girl appearing waifish and unsure. The contrast between the usual self assured adult fairy and this anxious young teenager was striking. Aloe&#39;la now could only cringe as the pair exchanged an awkward kiss before the boy entered his home.<br />
<br />
As the car departed, Aloe&#39;la remained in order to observe this boy more closely. As he entered the home, the fairy could see an older man he resembled the boy. She immediately believed him to be the boys father, his hair the same color and he even sported glasses like his son. It appeared the man had been reading, Aloe&#39;la noting it was some sort of legal file. It seemed the man worked withon the judiciary as some sort of lawyer but he was turning his full attention to his son.<br />
<br />
It was hard to hear what was being said but the father appeared to want to know how the boys evening went. The son was all smiles, his cheeks blushing as he recanted his evening. Now two more figure entered, one appeared to be the boys mother, the other a slightly older teenage girl. Aloe&#39;la had always found it fascinating how humans could look so similar. In fairy families, the coloring of siblings and parents was as varied as the world. Humans, though, seemed to resemble one another. The sister was a pretty young woman with a mother who looked like an older copy. Both seemed excited about the boys date, the sister playfully teasing her younger sibling. Both parents now lightly admonished the girl before the family hugged. Humans always were emotional.<br />
<br />
As the boy now made his way towards his room, Aloe&#39;la spied through the windows. Able to pinpoint which was his she now peered through the window to observe his room. Perhaps his personal belongings would give a better indication of who this boy was. All Aloe&#39;la could see now though were posters, books, and a few musical instruments strewn on the ground. The room looked like any typical teenage boys room, a bit of a mess but nothing out of the ordinary. As boy the smiled, he now switched on his small TV before starting a video game. From what the fairy could tell, the game was some sort of war game. The boy talking into a headset mic as his game avatar dodged and weaved around objects.<br />
<br />
Aloe&#39;la furrowed her brow, the small blue fairy now leaving without being noticed. As she now conjured a portal to her world, she felt somewhat disappointed. Outwardly there was nothing wrong with this boy or his family but humans could be tricky. She just needed more time and a chance to talk with Star.</p>
