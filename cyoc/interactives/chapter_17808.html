<P>It had taken Mark a little time to figure out what had happened to him. As he had killed the shower worriedly and stepped out of the tub, he found he was smaller. That didn’t make any sense, and he was in shock as he toweled himself off. He had sat on the lid of toilet in confusion for a few minutes, holding his now gigantically long and heavy limp penis in both hands. It was so big it didn’t recede into his sheath anymore, and he could fold it over his shoulder. His testicles were oversized and when he walked they bounced and flopped against his thighs, dangling nearly to his knees. Eventually he had put two and two together, and came to the conclusion that his last orgasm had shrunken his body down, but his cock and balls had stayed the same size. Mark was conflicted about whether this was a bad thing or not, but he decided he’d better get this fixed.</P>
<P>In response, and to his amazement, his body instantly restored itself to its original height, putting everything back in proportion. Mark gasped and got to his feet. How did Ty fix him? Mark shook his head and looked around the bathroom. He wished he knew what the heck was going on. In another instant, a stream of information suddenly entered his mind. Ty had wished for and gotten the power to change anything he wanted, and in changing Mark, Ty had passed on his ability on with a simple thought. Ty had given Mark his power too! Mark gulped, and thought about growing taller until he said "stop" out loud. He stood at the bathroom mirror and leaned over the counter excitedly watching himself, and sure enough his height began to steadily increase. From his even six feet, he allowed himself to grow an extra foot taller to seven feet before he practically whispered "stop" in amazement. He realized with a sly grin that he had been thinking about how big his cock was when he had been sucking it, and that must have changed him. He’d have to be careful about what he thought of from now on.</P>
<P>Now what was going on downstairs? Mark wondered. As he left the bathroom he heard June in the master bedroom, humming a sweet song. He peeked through the halfway closed door and saw his wife putting on her sexy red stockings and scanty dress. He gasped in pleased surprise. He hadn’t seen her wear that outfit in years. He felt his genitals stirring again, and quickly looked away and willed himself to calm down and focus. He did, and his arousal subsided. He’d have to get back to June fast! Curiously, he peered downstairs just in time to see Ty giving a hand job to a huge muscle-bound Minotaur and the living room carpet and wall dripping with semen. He went wide-eyed and averted his gaze in embarrassment, fresh memories on his being shrunken and under Ty’s control in his mind. Apparently his stepson was really getting off on his power, and before he could relax Mark wanted to make sure that Ty wasn’t going to get carried away.</P>
<P>Peeking from upstairs, he silently willed the living room to clean itself up, for one thing. Instantly the room was cleansed and freshly wiped down. Ty was too busy jerking off Dustin to notice. Secondly, Mark willed Ty to stop what he was doing with Dustin. Ty gasped and took a step back from the big Minotaur. "Ty," Mark walked down the stairs and said, "Dustin does have a girlfriend and everything. Um, I don’t really want him to be gay, and I don’t think he does either." Ty looked sheepish and his face went red. "Another thing, Ty," Mark continued, "I know your power is pretty exciting, but could you keep it under control for me?" Ty nodded, not wishing to disobey Mark now that he had grown even larger. "Okay, thanks." Mark said, and hurried back upstairs. He practically ran, aching for June.</P>
<P>Dustin was now kneeling before Ty, his horns clacking against the living room coffee table as he inhaled and exhaled huge gusts of breath. His erection was starting to subside, and rational thought was returning to him. "Oh, Christ," he muttered. "Ty. What the fuck did you do to me, you little faggot?" Ty was no longer intimidated by Dustin, since he was able to control him if he got out of hand. Still, a giant Minotaur bellowing at him was a bit unnerving. Dustin paused while Ty said nothing, and then smiled. "Thanks," Dustin said, and crouched on the carpet, too huge to stand up. His erection had softened entirely and was shrinking back. "Oh man." Dustin said, grabbing his head and shaking it. "This is so fucked up, you know? But… I’ve wanted to be this way, well. How did you know? How the hell did you do it?" Dustin laid back and propped his back up against the couch as Ty explained everything.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Dustin said with a grin. "Just don’t go homo on me again, like, without asking, okay?" Ty nodded. "So," Dustin said, leaning back and picking up his torn shorts, now incredibly small. "Uh, what now?"</P></p>
