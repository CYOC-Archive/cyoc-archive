<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Making love in the pool felt wonderful.  I couldn't wait to make love in the hot tub at this point.  But there was no time for that now.  The day awaited me and I was determined to accomplish a lot.  After Bozantum and I finished we called for food enough for everyone.  By the time it arrived everyone else had not yet emerged.  But the smell of the food soon permeated through the penthouse and everyone awoke.  I noticed that everyone had their garments on.  That was good, I thought.  No matter how much sex had taken place, they all realized that, even though their garments covered little, they were normal to everyone else and so they had to wear them rather than walk around naked.<br />
<br />
We shared a nice breakfast.  Plenty of pleasant conversation took place.  Mostly we all talked about our sexual experiences with each other so far.  Everyone looked more than willing to discuss things, even Thigersa, which still surprised me a bit.  I was glad to see that Bozantum didn’t show jealousy when I talked about being with Myrintha.  I was also happy to hear him share his experience with Jucodon.  I hoped that would make them all realize that we could be open with each other, both verbally and sexually.<br />
<br />
“What are we going to do today, my goddess?” asked Bozantum.<br />
<br />
“I want to find a few more people to join the group,” I said.  “Myrintha and I were going to discuss that last night, but as you all know, we didn’t get that far.”<br />
<br />
“Why did you want to discuss that with me?” asked Myrintha.<br />
<br />
“To see if there would be anyone you or I know personally who might be a good candidate to join,” I explained.  I emphasized the words “you” and “I” in the hope that she would understand I meant Joe and George in that context, not our current selves.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, I see,” she said.  “I think I might have one person in mind.  Remember Tommy Chen?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” I said.  Tommy Chen was someone Joe and George had met in college.  Originally born in Taiwan, he moved to the U.S. when he was six when he was adopted.  Unfortunately for him he was always awkward and shy around other kids, and hadn’t overcome those traits as he’d grown older.  Fortunately for him he was an exceptionally smart person and excelled in science.  That was how Joe and George met him.  He was a teaching assistant in their chemistry class and really helped them to have a better understanding of the class.  They might not have ever passed without his help.<br />
<br />
Tommy had gained some attention for experiments he ran and top schools were looking to see if they could get him to go to their school.  But Tommy felt comfortable in our town and didn’t want to leave.  That changed about two months ago.  We learned that his parents both died.  They were an older couple who’d adopted him when they were both in their late 40’s.  Even so it was a bit of a surprise that they’d passed away, as they were now in their mid 60’s.  Now that they were gone there was nothing to tie Tommy to our town any longer.  It was likely he was just in the process of deciding which school whose offer he was going to accept.<br />
<br />
On the other hand there was nothing to tie him to our town any longer.  That meant that he came with no baggage and nothing that might prevent him from accepting an offer to start over.  I also liked the idea of adding someone of such intelligence.  Not that I felt there was anything the ring couldn’t do for us, but to have someone who already had a great deal of knowledge would be beneficial.  I did want to add diversity to the group as well, so he seemed an ideal choice.<br />
<br />
“Anyone else you can think of?” I asked Myrintha.<br />
<br />
“Not right now,” she answered.<br />
<br />
I liked at my two newest recruits.  “Anyone that you can think of?” I asked both of them.<br />
<br />
“No,” said Stephgress.  Thigersa likewise shook her head.<br />
<br />
“See if you can think of anyone,” I said.  “Otherwise we might need to randomly pick people.  So, here’s the plan.  Myrintha and I will go ‘recruit’ Tommy.  The rest of you can just stay here and hang out.  Just don’t do anything stupid, like mess up the place or antagonize any of the hotel staff.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe we’ll show off our fantasy,” suggested Thigersa.  <br />
<br />
“Well, be careful if you do,” I said.  “I don’t want the place destroyed.”<br />
<br />
Myrintha and I headed for the elevator.  Myrintha grabbed one of the key cards.  Just as with Bozantum, I had to create a sealable pocket in her garment.  A quick elevator ride and we were back in the lobby.  I glanced over to the reception area.  My receptionist adversary was not there.  I looked forward to needling him again later.</p>
