<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“As much fun as it would be to go out we probably shouldn’t,” Ann sighed. “Last thing we want is to get younger while we’re out. We could end up too young to get back safely.”<br />
<br />
While Jackie nodded in agreement, Stephanie frowned. “Ugh no fun,” she sulked. “What’s the point of being young again if we can’t enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
“We can enjoy it,” Ann said defensively. “I think we should just stay here for now. Next time we stay this age we can go out, for right now we should probably stay safe.”<br />
<br />
Unhappy but satisfied Stephanie now began looking through the fridge as Ann let out a sigh of relief. Jackie had watched this intently. Her maturity had yet to be affected by the spell, however gazing at Ann and Stephanie she could see both women acting differently. Concerned she now pulled Ann aside. “You doing okay,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
Ann felt her face flush as she looked at Jackie. She could feel her adult confidence slowly slipping away as time continued. Already she was feeling more and more like the insecure girl she used to be. “I’m okay,” she said quickly. “It’s just weird, I’m feeling more like a kid with each passing second. It’s really uncomfortable trying to stand up for myself. I...I really want to fit in with everyone.”<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Jackie said softly. “Look you don’t have to worry about fitting in Okay. Me and Stephanie both like you regardless so we won’t hold anything against you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Ann grinned. “By the way how are you doing?”<br />
<br />
Jackie grinned mischievously as she looked at Ann. “Remember I may look like An adult but I’m really a kid. It’s going to be a little while before I start becoming les mature.”<br />
<br />
As the two now glanced over at Stephanie they could see the raven haired girl setting up some cups, a six pack of beer sitting on the table. “Steph,” Ann asked. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know about you two but I feel like partying,” she smirked. “Before we end up back in grade school how about we play a game of flip cup.”<br />
<br />
Ann smiled and nodded as Jackie just gave the two an odd look. “Seriously,” she said flatly. “Is that all you two did in college? Drink and party?”<br />
<br />
“Well was in a sorority,” Stephanie shrugged. “Was kind of my thing. Even if I hated that scene. I would of rather just chill with some girlfriends and do something that didn’t kill brain cells.” <br />
<br />
“Well this is you’re chance,” Jackie stated. “Why repeat the same thing when you could do something different? We can just go relax and talk if you want?”<br />
<br />
“I..I think I agree with Jackie on this one,” Ann stammered, the blond girl looked hesitantly at her friends. She was torn between wanting to have fun and just relaxing. She hope Stephanie wouldn’t get offended by suggesting they just relax instead of drinking. Stephanie seemed to ponder this for a moment before nodding. “You know what Jackie you make a good point,” she grinned. “Let’s forget the game and just go hangout in the living room.”<br />
<br />
Jackie sighed in relief as Stephanie now handed her friends a beer apiece. While Ann happily took the beer Jackie paused. “Do adults always bring alcohol into everything they do,” she thought. Taking the drink the three made their way into the living room. As they settled down onto the couch they happily began to talk about not only their lives but their childhood as well. As  the conversation continued Jackie noticed as the three of them grew younger once more.<br />
<br />
While Ann and Stephanie seemed oblivious to this fact, Jackie could see the girls age backwards once more. The women’s faces became more innocent while their womanly curves seemed to vanish. In only moments three 16 year old girls now sat where three 21 year olds had been previously. While Jackie had yet to experience a reduction in her maturity she could see Ann and Stephanie feeling the effects.<br />
<br />
Both teens now drank their beer while glancing nervously around the room. The two appeared to be anxious as if they did not want to get caught drinking. Jackie could see that Ann was becoming more withdrawn as time passed. She had known that Ann was a shy kid growing up but had not realized just how shy she was. Ann seemed to clench her shoulders tightly as she tried not to make eye contact with the others. Jackie couldn’t help but find the girl adorable as she shifted nervously in her overly large clothes.<br />
<br />
“Ann you feeling okay,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Ann jumped as if startled as she looked nervously at Jackie. “Sorry,” she whispered. “It’s crazy but....I’m really feeling my age right now. I must look like a total dork right now.”<br />
<br />
Jackie smiled, placing a gentle peck on Ann cheek. “I think it’s adorable,” she smiled, causing Ann to blush red. Unfortunately Stephanie had been privy to this little display, as she now gaped in surprise at the two.<br />
<br />
“Oh, My, God,” she gasped. “Are you two like, a couple!?!?”<br />
<br />
Ann blushed crimson as Jackie now tuned to face Stephanie. “Sort of,” she replied. “We just...never really acted on it.”<br />
<br />
Stephanie continued to stare at the two, absentmindedly adjusting her ill fitting clothes. “Wow,” she gasped. “I like had no idea. I mean, like it’s cool and all but um I didn’t know Ann was um...you know...gay.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not gay,” Ann said defensively, quickly kicking herself for her childish outburst. “Umm What I mean is. I really care about Jackie. We’re...close.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not judging,” Stephanie said quickly, trying not to upset her friend. “I like justbwish you would of told me. I mean...I thought we were friends.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god we are Steph,” Ann said hugging the girl. “I mean I like really enjoy hanging out with you. These last few weeks have been like totally the best. I mean I wouldn’t of invited you here if I didn’t think you were the coolest.”<br />
<br />
Steohoanie brightened as she looked at Ann, someone thought she was cool. Shaking her head she now realized just how immature her and Ann were acting. “Okay this is too weird,” she giggled. “I’m feeling like a teenager now. I’m totally overreacting to this. If you two feel like that it’s cool. I’m just happy you think I’m cool enough for you to tell me.”<br />
<br />
“Know the feelin,” Ann giggled. “Feeling just as awkward and insecure as I did the first time I was a teen. But I am glad we can be friends Steph. Really do like hanging out with you.”<br />
<br />
Jackie watched as the two 16 year olds looked themselves over, realizing they were now quickly approaching their childhood. “Gues it’s a good idea we didn’t go out,” Stephanie giggled. “At this rate we’re going to on be playing with dolls soon.”<br />
<br />
As the three teens now giggled they wondered how much longer it would be befor they became 6 years old once again.</p>
