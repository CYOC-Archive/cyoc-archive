<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The evidence is all circumstantial,” the district attorney looking at the file; “an email with a few addresses, a text message with no response. I’m not sure I have a case to convict Jack Crawford.”<br />
“We have the shooter,” Agent Reeds placing another file on the prosecutor’s desk; “arrested in Moon Lake a few hours after shooting Frederick Parker. The evidence against him,” Agent Reed adding; “is enough to put him on death row.”<br />
<br />
“The governor put a moratorium on that,” the prosecutor sighing; “I could make a case for the man to face execution, but it will just get commuted to life.”<br />
The prosecutor looking at Jose’s file after expressing his thoughts to the federal agent before him. Seeing that the man has not much of record to begin with; mostly small misdemeanors, unpaid traffic tickets.<br />
“It seems this guy’s file looks odd,” the prosecutor looking at agent Reed; “from running a red light to the murder of a court officer and attempted murder of a suspected crime lord. What am I missing?”<br />
“Sadly&quot;, Agent Reed looking apologetic; “not much is on this man. If this was his first time as a hitman, then he failed big time. Yet if he has been killing people for years and getting away with it,” Agent Reed sighing; “then we got lucky.”<br />
<br />
“Has he retained a lawyer” the prosecutor looking at the evidence collected against Jose.<br />
“No,” Agent Reed responding; “but he did make an odd request.”<br />
“And what would that be,” the prosecutor closing the second file.<br />
“Take the death penalty off the table,” Agent Reed looking bemused as she restates Jose’s request verbatim. “Life with the possibility of parole and I’ll tell you what I know. Hell I’ll even put it in writing, “Agent Reed finishing; “his words, exactly.”<br />
<br />
“Oh isn’t that precious,” the prosecutor chuckling; “if only all the criminals were willing to fall on the proverbial sword. His statement fingering Jack Crawford as the person who hired him,” the prosecutor grinning; “will be just what I need to convict the man.”<br />
“But the evidence gathered from his electronic devices,” Agent Reed looking confused; “is that not enough?”<br />
“It’s enough to take him to trial,” the prosecutor responding; “yet juries love testimony from witnesses and co-conspirators. Having Jose testify against Jack is the proverbial cherry on the parfait.”<br />
“Then I leave the deal making to you then,” Agent Reed getting up; “if that is all, I need to get back to the field office and type up my reports.”<br />
“Oh yes,” the prosecutor feeling giddy; “I’ll need those as well for the trial. Also I need contact information for this,” the prosecutor opening a file to look at a name; “Sheriff Douglas Cooper of Moon Lake. I’ll need his reports as well.”<br />
“I’ll give you the police station’s number,” Agent Reed answering; “their dispatcher will direct your call as needed.”<br />
“That will work,” the prosecutor accepting the piece of paper with the number on it.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Jose looked at the cell he was lead to by the corrections officer. The cold concrete shelf that stood waist high; with a thin foam mattress on top; it beckoned to Jose that this is where he will be sleeping. The stainless steel sink with seat less toilet bowl attached; in direct view of the cell door; denoting zero privacy for whatever reason. Jose knew he was going to be in this cell for a while, Smiling as he walks to the bed and sitting on it.<br />
<br />
Turning his head to see the cell door close; a solid steel door making an audible clang as the locks engage. Seeing two slots in the door; one for the guards to open up on their end to view the occupant at any time. The second slot at waist high was designed for a food tray to fit through. It was also wide enough for a person to slightly squat and place their hands through. Getting off of the bunk, Jose heads to the door; with his hands still cuffed behind him, Jose patiently waits for the C.O. to remove them.<br />
<br />
“Took you long enough,” Jose acting tough; rubbing his wrists where the cold metal rings hugged his flesh to the point of loss of circulation.<br />
“Shut it,” the C.O. responding; “and welcome to solitary confinement.”<br />
“Another condition to make for my cooperation,” Jose looking about the small room he was in; “better accommodations.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
“Jack Crawford!”<br />
Looking up as the cell door opens; the fuming were-panther sees the Correction Officer infront of his cell door. Knowing that the man is a normal; Jack could if he wanted to kill the man well before he had a chance to react. A thought that ran through the were-panther’s mind as he sat in the solitary cell; trying to think who would do this to him. At first, Jack was certain that his predicament was at the behest of the Elder Council; daring to call his bluff of exposing the secret existence of were’s the world over.<br />
<br />
After he got the message from his lawyer Jacoby Albertson; Jack was back to square one in trying to find out who set him up.<br />
“Get up off your ass,” the C.O barking; “or do you want to forfeit your bail hearing?”<br />
“So soon,” Jack looking stunned; “guess my attorney is good for more than lightening my bank account.”<br />
“Don’t expect much,” the C.O putting handcuffs on Jack; “bail is rarely ever given for those looking at a murder charge.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll see,” was all Jack said. ‘I’m sure Jacoby has a few cards up his sleeve to play,’ Jack thinking to himself; ‘with luck I’ll be back home before noon with my wife Kenya. Then woe to those that put me here,’ Jack seething on the inside as he looked calm while being escorted to only god knows where. ‘The first to feel my wrath will be Jose,’ Jack continues to think to himself; ‘he had to have a hand in this, I’m sure of it.’<br />
<br />
“In here,” the C.O opening another door.<br />
Looking inside, all Jack could see was a metal chair and a video camera mounted on a tripod and a television displaying a courtroom but with the volume muted. Turning to look at the C.O, Jack was given a shove and told to sit down.<br />
“Where the hell is my lawyer,” Jack snapping at the guard.<br />
“At the court house,” the C.O. answering; “this camera is a direct feed to the judge who will be overseeing your bail hearing. Since all you will be doing is entering a plea,” the C.O standing behind Jack; “there is no need to waste gas in trucking you to the court house.”<br />
“And what if I wanted to confer with my attorney,” Jack clearly angry at the situation; “privately!” Jack adding the C.O’s presence was neither welcome nor warranted.<br />
“Then he can come over here,” the C.O responding; “after the bail hearing. Regardless if you are unamused with the conditions you are forced to endure,” the C.O adding; “I’ve heard it all. The ‘it violates my civil liberties argument’,” the C.O rolling his eyes; “well guess what, this is S.O.P for all prisoners facing bail. Heading to court doesn’t happen until you are on trial for the crimes you are accused of.”<br />
“Intolerable,” Jack glaring as he sees his attorney through the television; “if I’m to endure this, I want to hear what my attorney is saying!”</p>
