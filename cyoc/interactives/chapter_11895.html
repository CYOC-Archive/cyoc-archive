<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dachsund Jeff steered his jackass steed, in reality his friend Tony, down some lightly traveled sand and oil surface roads to the end of one that simply stopped, without any turnaround circle.  Jeff steered his once extremely slender, now hyper muscular jackass friend down a bright orange gravel path and into the woods.  At first, the woods was a sea of yellow green maple saplings but eventually it turned into a stand of high pines that crowded out any vegetation low to the ground.<br />
<br />
Dachsund Jeff pulled let out two sharp barks and pulled back on both Tony's ears and Tony knelt to the ground amid a bed of pine needles.  All three dachsunds jumped off, happy to breath air away from their shockingly foul smelling friend.  All three congregated at a small pool of water while Tony trotted a few steps away and ate some high wild grasses.  He spent 15 minutes eating the long shoots before suddenly looking up in disgust.  It was not the taste of the grass, which to his equine palate was quite good, but the fact that absent conscious choice, he'd immediately acted as any other jackass would.  This worried him.  He ambled over to the pool where the dachsunds had been drinking.  He gazed obsessively at his reflection in the water cataloging all his repellent features.  He hated every aspect of his new body, even the giant penis that he'd felt beneath himself but hadn't seen till now.  It seemed like a cruel joke to him to be so equipped when he'd never fuck a woman in his whole life, being a virgin to that point.  He'd service mares, jennies and mules at the times chosen by his masters.  He'd pull a plow or turn a wheel or something else befitting his pathetic jackass state and when they didn't like his effort or when they were just in a mean mood, they'd whip his jackass buns till he felt it even through his thick smelly hide and yelped in pain.  The yelp would be crucial he decided.  They'll need to know that they're hurting the stupid jackass, me.  Hmmmph.  Me, a jackass.  He stayed in a similarly mordant mood for the hours that they remained there in the woods.  The dachsunds took turns napping but his mind couldn't rest and he could think of nothing but how ugly and disgusting he'd become.<br />
<br />
Dachsund Jeff got his fellow wiener dogs up and ready after midnight with a series of sharp barks.  He ran up to Tony, who was still staring bitterly at his jackass reflection in the pool and unleashed a fusillade of barks and yips at him.  Come on pal!  Let's get going!  No time for moping around now unless you want to stay that way!  Tony barely moved.  Jeff let out some more yips and Tony got the message to bend his head toward Jeff.  Jeff rubbed Tony's muzzle between his eyes and then hugged his muzzle with both paws.  The timing was perfect because the unwilling conscript into the equine ranks needed to feel affection more than anything at that moment.<br />
<br />
With a couple deep sighs, Jeff saw determination return to Tony's eyes.  He ordered him to the ground to be mounted by the three dachsunds and Tony quickly complied.  With Jack and Eric dug in on his back and Jeff pulling his ears tight, he rose to his full height and started off toward Emma Chase's home.  <br />
<br />
Jeff knew what the street name and number was and roughly where that street emerged off another street.  But he hadn't been there before and was surprised to find that it was part of a condominium complex.  He'd steered Tony to the the wooded edge of the opposite side of the street when, without any instruction, Tony ambled across the pavement toward a neatly landscaped sign.  Jeff tugged on both Tony's ears, the signal for stop.  He bit both Tony's ears.  Tony grunted but kept right on going.  &quot;What the hell's going on?&quot; Jeff wondered.  A car zoomed by just feet behind Tony's huge ass, lights visible for seconds before and after but Tony never flinched.  He went straight for a cluster of rose bushes and, to Jeff's bewilderment, bent his neck and ate one, then another, then a third rose.  He raised up on his hind legs for a moment but grunted angrily, seemed to shrug his shoulders and then followed Jeff's commands again.<br />
<br />
Jeff lead him carefully through woods along the edge of the condos, Tony following his commands, left, right, faster, slower, stop exactly as directed.  Finally, they arrived at a thick copse of maple saplings.  The dachsunds dismounted and Jeff reconnoitered the area.  Their luck was both good and bad.  A wind from the east kept Tony's horrible smell from setting off every other dog in the area.  The Chases lived in an end unit, a townhouse on the near end of a block of eight townhouses.  That was the good.  But the front door was locked, the garage door was locked as well.  The unit had rear balconies on two levels.  Jeff scampered up onto the first level balcony and looked inside.  That was apparently Emma's mother sleeping there and a half broomstick in the track of the sliding door made it clear that the door couldn't be opened.  Jeff climbed arduously up through a shrub adjacent to the unit and got to the second floor balcony.  There, on the other side of the sliding glass door was Emma, asleep in bed.  He looked through the vertical blinds for any sign of a computer or the emitter, but saw nothing.  To his chagrin, he saw what was probably the other half of the broomstick lodged in the track of the sliding door to Emma's room.  There was no way into the condo.  <br />
<br />
Back among the maples, Eric was noticing a serious problem.  The wind had shifted.  But dogs weren't smelling Tony.  Probably none were outside or near windows.  Eric sniffed something in the air, but couldn't place the scent.  He was about to look to Jack for help but heard Tony let out a funny whimper.  He looked up just in time to see Tony wiggle his gargantuan rump as his liter bottle penis swelled and lengthened to truly awesome proportions.  Tony let out a deep grunt and then a whole series more.  Now Eric could place it.  It was the smell of a mare and it was driving Tony crazy.  With his human mind in there somewhere, Tony ought to be able to resist it.  But Tony couldn't resist it.  Eric saw his gigantic friend turn and start off in the direction away from the condos.  No!  He ran as fast as his little legs could carry him and scampered atop first one rock then an adjacent higher one then a higher third.  There was a path through the woods that wound around the rocks making a hairpin turn.  Eric jumped out as far as he could and landed on the coarse back of his jackass friend.  He barked for all he was worth but Tony wouldn't heed him.  He could think of only one thing that he would.  He spun around to face Tony's massive rump, watching his almost vertical tail very closely.  He jumped off Tony's backside grabbing Tony's tail in his mouth as he went.  He swung in a quick arc that finished with all four paws smacking into Tony's balls.  The nearly half ton jackass was staggered by the blow from the ten pound dachsund.  He let out a furious grunt and might have taken action against his friend but the wind abruptly shifted.  The mare's scent was no longer in the air.  Tony felt his friend crawling up the crack of his huge ass and pulling on his tail.  He carried Eric back to the edge of the woods where Jeff waited alongside Jack.  They'd figured out a way to get in.</p>
