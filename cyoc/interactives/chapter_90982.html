<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even as Selene hugged you, you felt uneasy. Sure, your &quot;male mind&quot; was separate from you now, allowing for you, Michelle, and your male mind, Michael, to exist as two separate individuals, and you were all siren, but that didn&#39;t mean that you were giddy over being pregnant. Selene had been happy when she announced she was pregnant, but you and her had been married by that time and were probably trying to have a child. Your pregnancy was more like a teenager who figured she&#39;d have &quot;fun&quot; with her boyfriend and got pregnant as a result. You were individually unprepared to be pregnant, to be a mother, and the fact that so many other odd things were happening to you at the moment didn&#39;t make the revelation that one of the two jerks you&#39;d eaten in the break-room/office of a convenience store had impregnated you any easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be with you, Michelle,&quot; Selene spoke, &quot;both Michael and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... I feel like I cheated on you,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
Selene only gripped you tighter, &quot;No, Michelle... no, you didn&#39;t. You had just become a siren... you were hungry... you NEEDED to feed in order to live. That isn&#39;t cheating on me. Cheating on me would have been running off and falling in love with the first man you saw...&quot;<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t help you much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready,&quot; you whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have nine months to get ready,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;and do you love your daughter... the one that Selene gave birth to?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked up, &quot;Yes... she&#39;s so precious and tiny... I love her very, very, very, very, very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll want to be a &quot;father&quot; to her?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; you answered, &quot;even if I don&#39;t have any man parts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie gave you a bit of a reassuring smile, &quot;than you should be fine. You&#39;re quite ready to be a parent and probably very willing to be a parent. Your only &quot;problem,&quot; Michelle is that you&#39;re probably registering that based on your past as a man... before your run in with Florencia and before you somehow split yourself between your male and siren personalities. You are a siren and one hundred percent female... but in a way, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if you&#39;re still adapting to BEING female in a way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; you said slowly and you began to get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... you said you want to know why you&#39;re lactating?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to know if there is anything odd in my magic that would hurt my daughter...&quot; you told her.<br />
<br />
Julie seemed to look past you to where your daughter lay in her bed. You looked over see Michael standing by Lea&#39;s bed and offering a hand and finger for Lea to reach for. He seemed torn between congratulating you on your pregnancy, promising you support, comfort, and support, and giving Lea as much fatherly love as he could. You turned your head back to Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lea Amelie Fooller,&quot; Julie said slowly, remembering the conversation that you and Selene had managed with her regarding your daughter&#39;s birth certificate. &quot;The decision you all had will be well received as a tribute to the twins&#39; mother... and it is is still odd in a way to hear a siren with middle and last name...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM! Both Danielle and I have middle names,&quot; Sally protested, sounding a little annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;Frank gave you both his family name and a middle name... but remember... Sirens who have been named by humans or humans turned into sirens typically only have ONE name. I don&#39;t have a middle name and only have a last name because I married your father...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I received the name Fooller when I married Michael,&quot; Selene added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sally admitted with a chuckle, &quot;Okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
You listened as Selene and Julie had a bit of a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said you wanted me to test the magic in your milk?&quot; Julie asked as she came back to the more serious topics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Julie replied, &quot;Come with me...I have an old breast pump that I had when I was raising both of my biological daughters with Frank... we can use that and place your milk in some jars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, I&#39;ll have some things to discuss with Selene and Michael,&quot; Sally spoke.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t get to hear that as you were following Julie through the home that she and Frank owned. Things were relatively quiet, though you thought you heard a television on playing something that sounded like cartoons. Eventually she lead you into a small largely white colored room. In it was a large changing table two sets of cribs, though the inside of these cribs was set up like the small miniature bed for Lea that you and Selene had been given when you both joined Michael after Selene gave birth. You stood nervously looking around the room and at the wide open window that you and Julie were standing in front of, totally topless. Though your mind was more nervous about whether or not you were a threat to either Lea or your own unborn child, not your nudity.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the nursery room where I raised Sally and Daniella once they were old enough to not need to sleep in the same room as me,&quot; Julie announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the two cribs?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly Frank&#39;s idea... that if any other members of my sisterhood dated and married someone... we&#39;d have things ready in case,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;Though... so far that hasn&#39;t happened... Danielle has a boyfriend named Daniel, as you know, and Daniel is a Trusted, he knows Danielle is a siren... and Sally... she&#39;s been seeing a guy off and on... but nothing real serious... mostly do to their own schedules... his work schedule and Sally&#39;s with the Council of Sisterhoods.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then turned back to Julie who had opened a door into an internal sets of cabinets on the changing table, which included several sets of diapers and related hygiene supplies for changing an infant&#39;s diaper. What Julie was pulling out was a breast pump and one normal sized bottle. She offered the pump to you and specifically offered the nozzle that your nipple would fit into.<br />
<br />
&quot;This may take a little while and I&#39;ll need to some additional bottles,&quot; Julie spoke as she began hooking things up so that the pump could work, &quot;but this should make things easier for you for the moment... and will obviously give me plenty to analyze...&quot;<br />
<br />
You fitted the pump to your breast and Julie flipped the switch on. You almost immediately felt the pump gain suction and it pulled your nipple into it. At the same time, you felt your milk flow into the tubing and then going down into the bottle. For the moment it wasn&#39;t much, but it did make your breast feel lighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how long will it take to get a &quot;reading&quot; on this?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll take time,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;It won&#39;t be until after you get back from the Council Meeting before we&#39;ll have answers.&quot;</p>
