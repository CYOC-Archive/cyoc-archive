<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John now looked like a TV detective, with a mustache and wore a blue and white Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts. <br />
Jack now looked like a handsome TV father, with stubble. He wore a dress shirt and canvas vest with paramilitary jungle pants. <br />
Paul was a bald stud with superhero muscles, wearing a mechanic&#39;s jumpsuit. <br />
Bob looks like a blond Viking bear, with large muscles and a brownish gold beard. He is wearing a khaki uniform, his chest sticking out of a shirt too small. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, red arrow it is!&quot; Jack announced happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Love Shack? Dude, I do NOT want to kiss any girls,&quot; Bob said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;re gay, Bob.&quot; Jack said. &quot;I could go for some SEX, now that I am a, ya know, big adult and a man and all. Who votes to go to the Love Shack?&quot; Three hands went up. &quot;Bob&#39;s outvoted! Okay,&quot; Jack said, taking charge of their situation. &quot;How about we clean up and then move on out?&quot; <br />
<br />
Before they left, they did their business in the cabins. The cabins were small but they came with clean latrines. The boys cleaned up and were all amazed to find they had large, man sized dicks. They were all above average in the dick department. One by one they all looked at themselves in the mirrors, marveling at their new reflections. Each boy touched his new adult face, feeling stubble or beard where there was none just hours before. <br />
<br />
They found canteens full of water and backpacks for each of them to carry. There were supplies such as food rations, flashlights, and more. <br />
<br />
&quot;You boys ready to go?&quot; Jack asked the group. <br />
<br />
&quot;Us MEN are ready to go!&quot; John laughed a little too much, too giddily. He sounded immature, still. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this! I look so cool. I look like I could be my own dad! Only I&#39;m way hot! My dad is way fat. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next, so better not jinx it,&quot; Bob said warily. He was suspicious of a magic simulation that could make kids into adults. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re in a magic game! I guess they had to get the movie ideas from somewhere.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you think we&#39;re gonna stay like this? I wanna stay like this!&quot; Paul said. He was doing well trudging up jungle hills covered with tree roots. It&#39;s like his body was a powerhouse of energy now! <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you guys should trust your instincts. We are men, after all. And I&#39;m starting to think that this game has given me more than just a big body. I think my mind has changed as well,&quot; Jack continued. &quot;I can remember how to lead a team and operate a company. I have business knowledge.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got the ability to fix about any vehicle,&quot; Paul said. &quot;And I can fly a helicopter. I even got a license. It&#39;s in my pocket.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I think I can tell you what plants and animals are in the jungle here. I think I&#39;m a biologist,&quot; Bob said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a government agent. Special Forces,&quot; John bragged. &quot;I understand criminal science, and can communicate with any government agency. I can&#39;t wait for all this to be permanent now. The more I stay in this body, the more I enjoy it! Except for the mosquitoes.&quot; <br />
<br />
The other men were getting bit as well, so they continued along the trail for several hours until they reached a clearing. There was a flat area that overlooked the jungle and several green mountains rising up in every direction. They were surrounded by wilderness. On the plateau was a really nice house, very decked out. There was a pool, a jacuzzi, a generator, solar cells, and the house door was open. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wonder if there&#39;s any food in here!&quot; Bob wondered. He was getting pretty hungry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, check it out. Think I&#39;ll help myself to a few cold BEERS!&quot; Jack said, and brought bottles out for all his friends. &quot;I think this is cause for a celebration and we are big grownups now, so no one can tell us we can&#39;t drink!&quot; He twisted off the cap and took a big gulp. &quot;Mmmmmm! Yeah, I feel like a man, alright! I also feel like I should be in charge of this whole operation. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the leader. Paul, your job is obviously technician and extraction/transport. From what I can tell, John, you&#39;re an operative who can find and arrest foreign criminals or at the least provide us with intel so we can avoid trouble. Bob...not sure why we need a biologist here.&quot; <br />
<br />
All the boys were helping themselves to the beer. And it was working its way through their systems to make them super horny. None of them had ever experienced orgasm before. It was confusing. Many of them were becoming hard the more they drank. Finally, Paul undid his belt and dropped his trousers. <br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK yeah! Look at this! My cock is HUGE. And my body is even BIGGER than my Dad! He&#39;s going to be so fucking jealous of me! Hey! If we win the game, our dads can be little boys and we can stay this way!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But...I don&#39;t want to make my dad be a little kid again. That&#39;s mean,&quot; Bob said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I could live with it,&quot; Jack decided. &quot;My dad&#39;s a loser and our family needs a winner at the helm! With this body, I can be the breadwinner and call the shots. And quite frankly, it sounds like a good deal. I make a good deal of money in this universe. I intend to use it to have fun. Now, I think it&#39;s time we all talk turkey. Who here is turned on my men&#39;s bodies? Because, I&#39;m gay and I&#39;m ready to fuck.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go, bitch! Let&#39;s see what you got!&quot; Paul said. Jack dropped his pants. Swinging before him, his cock was 7.5 inches. Not as big as Paul&#39;s 11 inch monster, but just about as thick at 7 inches of girth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go find a bedroom. You two have fun,&quot; Jack told Bob and John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well. You&#39;re not gonna leave me all alone, are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just...a little freaked out by all this. It&#39;s like some crazy magic that just made us into grown ups and now I&#39;m gay?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why fight it if it feels this good. Now come here, stud.&quot; <br />
<br />
Their first kiss was fireworks. John lingered his tongue in Bob&#39;s mouth, savored the feeling of his mustache against Bob&#39;s beard. <br />
<br />
&quot;How big is your dick, buddy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty enormous,&quot; Bob admitted. He dropped his cargo shorts. His dick was a whopping nine inches hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad. Bigger than mine. Guess you and me will have to figure something out,&quot; John said. &quot;I&#39;m only about 6.5 inches, so I&#39;m going to let you fuck me. Something tells me you&#39;re a top, albeit a shy top.&quot; <br />
<br />
They found a large bedroom. All of the wood was teak and the beds were spotless, like some kind of crazy resort. <br />
<br />
They fell on the bed, slightly tipsy. Bob had been more nervous than the others but after a few beers in him, he was slightly more uninhibited. <br />
<br />
John knew what to do. He ran his tongue up and down Bob&#39;s now huge shaft. He had never felt sensations like this before. His dick was so much more sensitive now. Is this how his dad&#39;s dick felt when it got hard? No wonder guys enjoyed having sex so much. <br />
<br />
He moaned. John slurped and slurped until Bob was about to cum. Then, unexpectedly, John turned around and grabbed the lube on the small lamp table, and after applying the cold lubricant directly onto a shocked Bob&#39;s dick, slammed his ass down on Bob&#39;s cock. Bob&#39;s eyes went wide. He was seeing stars. This was the best feeling he&#39;d ever felt! He was so huge! He was impaling his friend&#39;s ass! It felt incredible! <br />
<br />
John moaned as he rode up and down on Bob&#39;s big bear cock. Up and down. Bob stayed still, clutching at the sheets of the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! OHHHHHHHH! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Oh! OhhHHH! OHHHH! OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!&quot; <br />
<br />
His first burst of cum was dizzying. He&#39;d never felt anything like it. His cum slid between he and his friend. He loved the feeling of being inside John&#39;s ass. It was the single most liberating thing he&#39;d ever experienced. <br />
<br />
They held each other, sweaty man meat touching sweaty man meat. <br />
<br />
&quot;You still wanna go back to being just a kid?&quot; <br />
<br />
Bob shook his head &#39;no&#39;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Neither do I!&quot; John kissed Bob on the lips. This was way more fun than being a kid for sure, he thought. <br />
<br />
The Love Shack had lived up to its name.</p>
