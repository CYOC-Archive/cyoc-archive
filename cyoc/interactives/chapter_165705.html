<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ok listen Kyle, I am truly sorry for what we did. It wasn&#39;t right of me to do that to you.&quot; Quickly apologized Jen, knowing full well the power of the curse. She had personality witnessed it happen to one of her former classmates. The outcome was so bad that they dropped off the face of the planet. She never had heard a single thing about them since, not even a rumor. So needless to say, she was terrified at what Kyle would do to her. But with her apology, she had accidentally used up her remaining time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you for the apology. It is a step in the right direction I guess, and for you its a big step. I&#39;ll keep that in mind. But it still doesn&#39;t excuse you for your actions. However I won&#39;t make you physically suffer at least. It will feel good, I promise.&quot; Started Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, since your time is up, you now get both. So lets start with the transformation. Do you happen to know what an onahole is? Well its basically a fleshlight, except it can come in different shapes. That is what you are to become. You will transform into a Jen shaped onahole, except without arms or legs. Also your hole will be your real pussy. You will have full control of every inch of it too, and you will posess extensive knowledge on the best practices for pleasing dicks in existance. You will keep all of your senses too. However you will now taste with your pussy since you cant use your mouth, and for touch, everything will feel good to you. No pain, itching, burning, chills, or achiness. And with that said, will not need to eat, drink, breath, or use the bathroom. Nor will you be able to be damaged in any way. Your pussy will also be permently lubricated, but not enough where you overflow yourself. You also cant pull yourself off any cock that gets inserted into you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so I am now doomed to be an inanimate object for eternity?&quot; Asked Jen bursting into tears, but unable to stop the phonecall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sadly yes, but there is a plus side. You will have a super A.I. with an augmented reality program. Your system requires no absolutely no power, and cant break. With the system, you can project yourself into the view of your user, for upto a 100m radius. This projection will not be a le to interact with the physical world, but you can see with its eyes and hear with its ears. You also can communicate with your user through her mouth or directly with your mind. Your avatar will be your current body, but your user has the ability to adjust parts of it, such as hair color and length, weight, height, and your cup size to name a few examples. Your personally too can be altered on request. You will be 100% obedient to your current user, and believe your existance is solely to serve your current user with unquestionable devotion. You will have access to the internet too, but be 100% unhackable, cant be ddos, and have perfect virus immunity. But you wouldn&#39;t be an AI system with your current level of intelligence. So you will become a super intelligent system, having knowledge in every field, and when you do find you lack some knowledge, you are able to use the internet to fill in the blanks as best you can. Lastly, your body will house a system which in microscopic, and unable to be felt. This system will take any amount of urine, sweat, and cum you collect and break it down into particles, releasing them from your exterior. Basically any liquid, dead cells and any unhygienic foreign entity will be cleared away by you, keeping your user&#39;s cock perfectly clean and healthy. Actually I forgot one important part of your transformation. If a girl finds you, she can use you as a dildo and get the same features. Except you can also vibrate and taste externally and not just with your pussy. Plus you will handle her period completely and function as her condom if she has sex. If you are used as a condom, whoever wore you first before theybstarted having sex is your user.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so I am basically now an AI? And I am completely a slave to my user?&quot; Whimper Jen, still crying, but a bit releaved she won&#39;t be trapped as an inanimate object unable to do anything for all eternity. She truely was thankful she apologized when she did. It likely saved her from an eternity of emptyness as an object.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for your dare. I will keep it simple. You will be happy and love being an AI system attached to an onahole. You also love the taste of anything that touches you, and enjoy the smell too. However, your current existance will disappear and will be erased from the memory of everyone except for you and me. However,  you can tell it to any user if you wish. Next, you will not be angry at me, nor try and regain your old life back by any means, nor try and get revenge on me. You also will have full knowledge of yourself and how you work. And lastly, before you begin changing you will come to me, ask me transform or dare. You will dare me to wear you for the rest of my life, and for transform, you will give me a fully functioning pussy right behind my balls as well a pair of tits which I can control completely. You then finish by putting yourself up my pussy as you transform without hurting me.&quot; It was with that that Kyle hung up.<br />
<br />
Jen also hung up, undressed herself and walked out of her house, headed for Kyle. She was no longer in control of her body. She had been forced to stop crying as well, now wearing a slight smile for the rest of her eternity. Not one showing extreme happyness, but one showing contentment. As she walked she contemplated the last few minutes of her current life. Reality was already changing around her. She could tell because she no longed was being acknowledged by anyone. Her existance was truely being removed from everyone&#39;s mind. As she walked, she started thinking that this may not be quite so bad. She always tried to see the positives when things got bad for her. She felt that with her new existence, she could maybe do a lot of things she never could have even dreamed she would one day do. She could raise her user up to be some super person. And when she had no current task, she could use then internet and her super intelligence to help people or catch bad guys. She could even assist her old friends and family, as some kind of secret guardian. Maybe she even could convince Kyld to build her a body which she could remotely opperate. <br />
<br />
She actually was getting a bit excited. It wasn&#39;t like her family was dead or that she couldn&#39;t ever see them again. And it wasn&#39;t like she currently spent all that much time with them anyways. They both worked and went out almost every chance they got. Leaving her alone or with the maid every other day. She sometimes saw them only a handful of times in a month. It wasn&#39;t that they disliked her, but had to work, and socialize for work, in order to keep their current income steady. They often sent Jen gifts too, and she had practically a blank checkbook to keep her occupied.<br />
<br />
Now just outside Kyle&#39;s house. Surprisingly he lived only a few minutes from her house and she never realized it. Entering the house she made her way into Kyle&#39;s room, where the rest of the dare took place.<br />
<br />
Seeing Kyle laying on his bed, she began &quot;Transform or Dare&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both&quot; answer Kyle not even looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;For transform, you will gain a fully functioning pussy, positioned right behind your balls. Also, you will gain fully functioning tits, which you have full control over. For dare, you are to let me shove myself painlessly into your pussy and keep me their until you die.&quot; Said Jen in a monotone voice. <br />
<br />
Kyle felt a slit openup right behind his balls. He could feel his new womb, his new ovaries, even his sensitive clit. It felt nice. His chest began to inflate, forming a pair of DD tits, and his chest hair disappeared completely. Wanting to test it out, he tried shrinking them down until they were completely flat. After a few seconds kyle once again had a completely flat, albeit now hairless chest. He willed them to become the size of bean bag chairs, and they grew to that size, now pinning him down under their weight. He willed them back to their initial DD cup size, however he willed himself to become overly engorged with breastmilk too. The moment his tits got to the desired size, a seemingly endless amount of milk began spraying out of his nipples, soaking his bed and carpet. &quot;Shit&quot; sweared Kyle, willing his tits to become only half filled with milk. His duel milk streams stopped abruptly. It was at this moment he saw Jen. She was armless and legless and a bit less then a foot in length, just laying on her stomach. Her head was facing forward too, and her tits were below her, elevating her front slightly. She still looked like a human, but her pussy now was her entire underside and was permanently open in an O shape, ready to take a cock of any size.<br />
<br />
Picking her up, Kyle spread his legs out, farther than he was expecting into a full split. His legs bending a full 90° out away from him. Uzing his free hand, he lifted up his scrotum, exposing his wet pussy. Moving Jen down, her head facing his pussy so that her tits were facing forward, he shoved pusged her in to himself in one go. Her head fully penetrating his cervix, filling his womb completely. His cervix tightening around her neck, locking her permanently in place until Kyle died. No doctor would be able to remove her now, unless they killed Kyle trying to do so. <br />
<br />
As Jen&#39;s systems booted up, she awoke to complete darkness. Her user was registered as Kyle. He would be her master/mistress for the rest of his/her life. She noted that she was currently incapable of determining her users gender since they possesed both male and female sets, and would require their input later. Her boot-up complete, she activated her augmented reality systems in order to properly greet Kyle.<br />
<br />
Kyle, who was really horney now that their pussy was permanently filled saw a figure materialize in front of them. She was identical to Jennifer Smith in every way, except for the fact that she was wearing black 5&quot; heels and a sexy black buisness mini skirt and a white blouse which showed her ample cleavage. Her hair was done up in a stylish way. If he had to describe ber look, it could only be called a sexy/slutty secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Kyle. My name is Jen. I am a hyper intelligent, A.I. with augmented  reality capabilities. Since your womb is currently houses my core, it makes you my current user. Due to you having both a male and female reproductive systems, I am unable to determine a default gender. Could you please clarify your current desired gender? Or would you rather I keep to gender neutral pronouns? In the case of the latter, I will use &#39;Master&#39; when addressing you by default.&quot; Said the projection of Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, let me fix that.&quot;</p>
