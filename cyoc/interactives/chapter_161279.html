<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking a quick shower, Sasha and Gloria now found themselves at the park with Mia and Zacks magical friends. Although she wasn&#39;t quite sure how to begin, she did realize that a group of children wanted to run and play. &quot;Mia,&quot; Gloria asked. &quot;What can you tell me about all this?&quot;<br />
<br />
The witchling turned towards her tabby familiar, offering the imp the opportunity to explain what was going on. &quot;Well Kellie your aunt is forging alliances,&quot; Rexie said. &quot;From what I heard shes talking with the kitsune and the boss lady now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you, Mia, and Zack get involved,&quot; Sasha asked. Rexie shrugged, looking up at her master. &quot;Wasnt us so much,&quot; she said. &quot;When the other magical families heard what was going on they tried to beat Lilith to the punch. Mia, well, she just happens to have a group of friends connected to all the magical families.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why not wait til after Kellie is done talking with the kitsune,&quot; Sasha asked. <br />
<br />
Rexie chuckled, the tabby cat shaking her head. &quot;Man you guys really don&#39;t know much about the magical families,&quot; she said. &quot;None of them trust eachother. There&#39;s alot of tribalism in the magical world. Undead dont trust kitsune, tanuki dont trust fairies, hell even the dragons fight one another based on whether their east or west. What&#39;s being proposed is groundbreaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do you explain Mia and Zacks friends,&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of a grand experiment,&quot; Rexie shrugged. &quot;Mia&#39;s friends are magical in nature but they reside in the mortal world. They don&#39;t have the same kind of prejudice that the adults have. That&#39;s why they asked me to introduce them to the wizards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why come to us then,&quot; Sasha asked. &quot;I mean couldn&#39;t you talk with Gloria&#39;s sister or the other Kellie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Mia knows you two,&quot; Rexie exclaimed. &quot;So if my master is going to make this work, she needs someone who knows her.&quot; Gloria nodded, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. It made sense, Mia and Zack didn&#39;t really know the others. Katie and her friends were older and the doppelgangers from the other timeline dealt mostly with Jack and his friends. Still, the idea of having to be some kind of magical diplomat did make the teens head spin.<br />
<br />
As Gloria was about to answer, she paused. The teen felt an incredible power begin to manifest around her. Curiously she turned, watching in stunned silence as a portal now began to open in the park.<br />
<br />
Villar stretched as the portal around him dissipated. Finally he had arrived in this timeline, and just in time too. Glancing downwards he smiled at the group of magical children standing before him. &quot;Hello children,&quot; he growled. &quot;Playtime is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack and Winery now began to transform as Villar brought his fist into the ground. The shockwave of his attack knocked the others backwards, the two wolf beats began to grow, thick fur and muscle covering their bodies as their mouths pushed forward. Where two children once stood, now a dark brown and snow white wolf beast loomed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Winery growled. &quot;You dare attack us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Villar smirked as the snow white wolf beast launched herself at him. The creatures claws and fangs bared as she looked to strike. Villar swatted the creature out of the air, sending Winery crashing into a nearby tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Winery,&quot; Zack growled. Villar turned, watching as Zack threw a punch at him. Grasping the wolf&#39;s attack with one hand, Villar could see the shock spread across his face as he slammed Zack into the ground. <br />
<br />
Gloria had watched the initial attack, stunned by this monsters appearance. As Villar now raised his fist to strike, Gloria sprung into action trying to freeze Villar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave Zack alone,&quot; Mia bellowed as she raced towards her friend. Villar raised an eyebrow as the young witchling sent a hex in his direction. The power of the girls spell was impressive, a lesser creature would have fallen. Villar though simply brushed the spell away, swatting Mia away like a nat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia NOOO,&quot; Rexie wailed as she watched her master crash to the ground. The imp now began to transform, her body growing as leathery skin replaced the tabby cats fur. Villar now tried to strike down the imp, only to have his actions slowed once more by Gloria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rexie get the kids out of here,&quot; Gloria exclaimed. The imp paused before nodding. Zack and Mia were hurt and unconscious, while the other magical children appeared shaken and bruised by Villars initial attack. Trying to gather the children, the imps eyes went wide as Villar now charged towards him.<br />
<br />
Now it was Sashas turn to strike, her Ring of Transformation glowing as the teen charged forward. Sashas skin began to harden as she now focused on her hand. Sashas fist now began to widen and grow, transforming into a hammer. Letting loose with a war cry Sasha brought her hammer fist down on Villars head, stunned when she saw him simply raise an eyebrow at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really think that will stop me,&quot; he laughed as he swatted Sasha away. Gloria watched as her friend was thrown backwards, although bruised she was quickly able to recover. Still, the combined power of the two wizards seemed ineffective against whatever this man was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m open to suggestions here,&quot; Gloria exclaimed as she let loose with a magical blast.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kids are hurt,&quot; Rexie stated. &quot;I need to get Mia to a hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria do you think you can open a portal,&quot; Sasha asked as she manipulated the ground around Villars feet to stop him. &quot;Maybe but I need some help,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help,&quot; Drake said, the dragon whelp slowly standing. &quot;Me too,&quot; Fayth added, the fairy holding one of her broken wings. Gloria nodded as the three of them began to concentrate. <br />
<br />
Villar smirked as he watched Gloria and the others focus on opening a portal. This first strike against the wizards and their friends was meant to gauge their strength and frighten them. Villar had succeeded in that end. If he wished he could end their spell with little effort.  For now though, he would give them false hope.<br />
<br />
As Gloria and the others focused their strength they could see a portal open beneath Villar. Blindly he now charged, stepping into the portal and vanishing from sight. As soon as he disappeared the three closed the portal before collapsing to the ground in exhaustion. &quot;Is he gone,&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
Sasha blinked, scanning the area before sighing. It appeared for now he was gone. Looking at the children though she could see the children were hurt and needed medical attention. Villars had struck first, now Gloria and her friends needed to prepare for battle.</p>
