<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors Note: All Cards are selected via Random Selection.<br />
<br />
Samantha reached out and selected two cards, an ‘Action Card’ and a ‘Change Card’. She hesitated, turning over the Action Card,<br />
“No Action Applies”<br />
<br />
“O-okay…” Samantha said, looking very uncomfortable, “what would happen if an ‘action’ applied?”<br />
“Mom, we have no idea. This is the first time we’re playing this!” Milly said impatiently. She may have the body of a grown woman, but she was still a teen in her mind,<br />
“I’ve never played this before, I have no idea…” Mike said.<br />
Samantha huffed.<br />
She turned over her Change Card, preparing for the worst,<br />
<br />
“Feline Ears,” she said.<br />
After the words left her mouth, immediately she felt her ears itch. She reached to them, only to find they’d moved position. They were climbing the side of her face. They began to point, becoming a lot wider and furrier, the same colour as her hair,<br />
“This is too weird, I want this game over as soon as possible…” she said, slumping back into her seat. It was hard to see her considering her considerably decreased height.<br />
<br />
“Mary, I guess it’s you,” Mike said,<br />
“Aww I wanted a go…” Milly complained,<br />
“How do you want to play this!” Mary said, almost shouting at her little sister… now big sister,”<br />
“Stop complaining!” Milly shouted back, “you got a big butt and gorgeous green eyes, it’s not like your changes have been that bad,”<br />
“Yeah… well…” she tried to respond, but couldn’t. She just grabbed her cards and read them aloud,<br />
“Last change reversed,” she said, then realising that meant…<br />
<br />
“Your butt!?” Milly said, her mouth open wide, staring at her sisters rear. She watched as it slowly deflated back to it’s original size,<br />
“Wow…” Mike said, clearly looking a little disappointed,<br />
“It’s whatever, I guess…” Mary said, also a little disappointed. As annoying as this game was, she liked the idea of having a big butt. This would’ve been a lot more fun if it was just her and Mike playing…<br />
<br />
“What’s your change card?” Milly asked,<br />
“Oh right,” she said, flipping over the change card, reading it aloud, “Bimbo Waist?” She said with confusion. Then suddenly a sharp pain at her waist, “ow!”<br />
“What’s wrong?” Mike asked, looking at her waist. Suddenly, as if several of her rips had just disappeared, her waist shrunk significantly, looking impossibly thin. Everyone stared,<br />
“Lift up your top!”<br />
“What the hell, Milly!” Mary exclaimed,<br />
“What…” Milly said, “just wanna see your ‘Bimbo waist’”<br />
“Ugh.” Mary said, sitting herself down. Mike didn’t say anything, but it was pretty clear that he wanted to see it too, “fine,” she said. She lifted her baggy top up and revealed her incredibly thin waist. It was almost the same width as her thigh, only just slightly wider.<br />
<br />
“Me! Me!” Milly said excitedly, grabbing two cards. She read out the action card, “ah man! Card Applies to Player on Your Right…”<br />
“So do you get to change?” Samantha asked,<br />
“I guess not…” Milly said, disappointed, “so this card applies to little Mikey,”<br />
“I’m not little Mikey,”<br />
“Whatever, lil’ Mike,” she giggled, reading out her Change Card, “New Racial Outlook?”<br />
“What the hell does that mean?” Milly asked concerned,<br />
“That seems… problematic,” Mike said, looking at her arm, suddenly his skin changing slightly, “m-my skin!” He exclaimed, watching it’s colour shift to a more yellow colour,<br />
“Your eyes!” Mary shouted, pointing at him. Mike could feel his eyes shifting slightly, becoming a little thinner. He felt his mouth shift slightly, nose as well. Just tiny changes, turning him totally Chinese,<br />
“Oh my god!” He said, standing up and finding a mirror, “I’m Asian!” He exclaimed. Luckily, his hair was already dark black so it didn’t change much, but he couldn’t believe that the person he was looking at was him!<br />
<br />
“Wow…” Milly said, studying Mike’s face, “kinda glad that’s not me…”<br />
Mike sat himself down, “okay, let’s just make this easier and not mention it,” he said, “pretty sure I could get cancelled if I did,”<br />
“Agreed,” Milly said, giggling. She looked at his face. Even with this significant change, he was still really cute to her… of course he’s Mary’s boyfriend, but if the opportunity arose, she wouldn’t turn it down.<br />
<br />
“I guess I have to change again, huh,” Mike said, grabbing the two cards. He looked at the action card,<br />
“No Action Applies,” he said, “thank god,”<br />
He turned his change card over, hoping for something simple,<br />
“Muscle Machine… oh god,” he braced himself.<br />
<br />
Everyone watched him as suddenly his clothes began to strain, his muscles growing drastically so quickly! His biceps were the first to burst open the sleeves of his jacket. His shirt tore open at the front, revealing his smooth and well built chest. His shoulders widened, splitting the jacket at the back. By the end of his change, he was built like a brick wall, but his clothes were totally ruined.<br />
All the women at the table, Samantha included, were speechless. If the women didn’t find him attractive to begin with, they definitely did now.<br />
It didn’t help that Mike was already ‘horned and horny’ and considering that race change didn’t turn him on that much, this one sure did. He was fairly hard beneath his jeans, and had to excuse himself,<br />
“I-I’ll come help you find something that fits,” Mary said, getting up from the table very quickly, following him to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The two stood in the slightly cramped bathroom, staring at each other,<br />
“I cannot tell you how HOT that was babe… this game was a great idea, but of course my stupid little sister had to intervene,” she complained,<br />
“It’s fine. I’m having fun, plus all the hot changes are going to me and you,” he said, grabbing her by her ridiculously thin waist and pulling her towards him. He pressed her breasts into his chest, feeling their warm softness against his tight chest made him even harder,<br />
“W-what about my sister?” Mary asked, taking Mike out of the moment,<br />
“W-what about her?” He asked,<br />
“You said ‘all the hot changes’… but my sister got huge tits,” she started, “you totally prefer tits over ass,”<br />
“Yeah yeah,” Mike said, “but my eyes are on you, babe. Whatever happens, you’re my number one girl and will always be the hottest girl in the room,”<br />
Mary blushed, “thanks babe,” she said grabbing him and kissing him passionately, “we gotta get back, I’m sure I have an old tank top that might fit you,”<br />
<br />
Before long, the four were sitting back at the table. The only thing they could find were Samantha’s brother’s tank top. It was made for a fairly chubby guy, but considering Mike’s size, and the fact that he could tuck it into his jeans, it worked for the moment. He scratched his horn before saying,<br />
“I guess it’s your turn, Samantha,”<br />
“Yes,” Samantha started, “I suppose it is,”<br />
<br />
She reached over and grabbed her two cards, hoping for something minor, or nothing at all.</p>
