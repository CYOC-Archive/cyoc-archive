<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carefully Kevin digs about the strong signal as his anticapation builds over what kind of find he has just found.<br />
<br />
The soil is soft and those thousands of cigerette butts has made the soil damp and easy to dig. The bright twinkle of something golden brings Kevin to laugh with glee at his discovery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey buddy what the hell are you doing in there?&quot; comes the yell from a security Policeman standing outside the yellow taped boundry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute I found something!&quot; Kevin calls back as he is fast unearthing his prize.<br />
<br />
Then it comes into view, a pair of old maybe gold rimmed specticals. A pair of glasses from years upon years ago still burried there in the compost under the grandstand.<br />
<br />
Prize in hand Kevin walks out from under the old wooden structure and smiles at the Policeman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man that thing is due to be destroyed next week!&quot; says the Cop.<br />
<br />
Kevin smiles, &quot;Maybe but its been there for over seventy years and I'll bet it doesn't just fall over with a little push!&quot; replies Kevin as he walks away a prize in hand.<br />
<br />
Back to his car and empty his pockets of coins, buttons, and assorted mostly junk. Sitting on the seat kevin reaches for the glovebox and retreves a small bottle of glass cleaner. Surprised that the octagon shaped glass lenses are still intact and not even cracked he sprays and cleans the dust away.<br />
<br />
As if a twinkle of the bright golden pieces surrounding the lenses and temple with ear hooks make him smile, it was the odd color changes reflecting off the glass which caught his eye.<br />
<br />
Holding the glasses up to the sumer's daylight Kevin thought he saw a reflection of people milling about behind his parked car. Quickly he turned around but nothing or nobody was even close at hand. Again he held up the glasses and peering through them Kevin saw many people walking about.<br />
<br />
Alone as he was on the street running down past the grandstand on one side and the Amtrak railroad line running just on the opposite side. Turning around this way and that he saw not a soul. A third look through the glasses had Kevin actually stretching them into place over the bridge of his nose and behind his ears.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the people were everywhere, some walking arm in arm with their mate, some in groups, and a few strange looking dudes just wnadering about.<br />
<br />
Twisting backward in his car seat and then looking from side to side he was astonished to see what he was seeing. As Kevin opened the door to his car and was ready to step out there appeared a pair of eyes seemingly looking at him from the other side of the glass lenses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beware!&quot; came a voice in bold and deep sounding tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who, what are you!&quot; replied a stunned Kevin his hands ready to rip off the glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beware what you see is in another time long past! Where you are is in your time ! If you move, walk, or leave this very spot you will be drawn into the scene never to return to where you are right now!&quot; warned the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then these glasses are something to cause time travel?&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no! Where you are has effected thousands of lives and thousands of events. You see the time and day which change history the most from this very spot! If you move, you will join that time, the glasses will fall away and what you knew will never have happened, ignorant shall you be and with fear shall you live from day to day!&quot; again warned the voice for Kevin not to move.<br />
<br />
Wishing not to learn this wonderous find to quickly Kevin sits and looks around. He watches the reaction of people passing by as they give him a look too. Minutes pass till one man runs up to Kevin's car, the man waving his hand and yelling something.<br />
<br />
Kevin turns to watch the man climb up onto his car and feels the vehicle rock a little from the man's weight.<br />
<br />
Then as if something from behind started to move Kevin watch with wide terror filled eyes as two dark legs stepped over him. A dark mass and then two hind legs of a horse followed closely by a old English horse drawn cabbie.<br />
<br />
Not moving an inch from his spot Kevin watched the rig move off until lost in the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that!&quot; exclaimed Kevin.<br />
<br />
The eyes reappeared and the voice answered his wonderment. &quot;A horse drawn cabbie was in that spot and had you exited your place in time a fine gelding horse would you live out your life from within!&quot; told the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean to tell me that I would have stepped outside my car here and into another time and another form to live as that horse drawing a cab for the rest of life!&quot; stated Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You understand well, had you moved what knowledge you learned would remain with your dead body and a soul of a man would reside inside a fear driven animal and horse!&quot; explained the voice.<br />
<br />
Kevin reached for the door handle with obvious intent of jumping out now that the carriage had passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! Leave not your place lest you enter another time and yet another form!&quot; warned the voice once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, but the cabbie is gone and I'd like to look around!&quot; said Kevin feeling very giddy about all he'd seen and heard.<br />
  <br />
&quot;Look, watch, and learn!&quot; stated the voice.<br />
<br />
Kevin froze in place as the people along the sidewalk seemed to slow their pace of movement and looked with what might be a face filled of fear.<br />
<br />
As before came the sight of something moving forward and from the rear of Kevin's car. This time the bulk was first and he saw short thick legs walking soon to be followed by another pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oxen, drawing a wagon loaded with beer kegs!&quot; announced Kevin as the wagon and load passed throught his spot in time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I might!&quot; Kevin began to say as the voice cut right in.<br />
<br />
&quot;To look, to watch, and to learn less you moved again and was to become an Ox yoked in bondage worse maybe more than the horse you might have become!&quot; reminded the voice of Kevin's almost foolish move.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I remove the glasses?&quot; asked Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then all is in the past, you remain of your time and place, safety is for you in your time and your life!&quot; told the voice.<br />
<br />
Reaching up Kevin slowly removed the glasses from his head and looked around with obvious caution. Kevin sighed relief as he was once again in his time and his car. As pearl sized drips of sweat ran down his forehead he looked at the glasses he found.<br />
<br />
Toying with the temple straps he noticed the glasses could be swung around as if looking through the glass lenses backwards. As this intrigued him he placed the glasses on and looked, watched and learned.<br />
<br />
A group of men stood some distance from him as all seemed to be looking at the grandstand. One man looked all at the others and with a twist of his wrist came a huge cloud of dust.<br />
<br />
Quickly Kevin ripped off the glasses to see the dust not there, the men not there, and he was sitting alone in his car. Slowly he put the glasses back on and the scene began once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see the future too!&quot; exclaimed Kevin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; boomed the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;The past if I look from one side the glasses and then the future if I look through the other side of the lenses, wow! I wonder why the previous owner when the glasses were lost didn't look or find them back?&quot; asked Kevin not expecting the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;She could not, Ellen was her name and she was at the races one fine day like this. She knew the glasses and had owned them for a few years making shrood deals and much money with the power to see ahead. It happened during her frantic joy learning the winning horses number that she removed the glasses. Time is of the essence here and Ellen forgot to look! As she turned to removed the glasses the winning horse walked through her space in time. Ellen found herself trapped inside the horse Seashore Run, she lived a long life as the stallion and sire of hundreds of fine Thoroughbreds! That's when the glasses were lost and why she could never look or find them back.&quot; that voice told the story.</p>
