<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David got his promotion and a raise at work. As a reward for himself, he bought an Asian king size bed (8’x8’) he had been wanting/needing for while. He had considered getting the Asian emperor size (10’x10’) but decided he would wait on that. <br />
<br />
David also used the extra money to literally fuel his muscle growth. After the experience in the sauna, David was determined to be as big as possible. He started focusing on nutrition, spending a fortune on chicken, lean beef and other sources of protein. Jason couldn’t believe the amount of food David was consuming. Sometimes, David would eat more at breakfast than Jason would eat all day. <br />
<br />
David’s workouts became more intense as well. He lifted like a man possessed and started getting a little following at the gym. He wasn’t the biggest guy, but his rapid growth had caught people’s attention. Smaller Asian men started asking him for advice and would cheer David on as he set new personal records. <br />
<br />
Life was busy for both David and Jason. David was learning his new leadership role at work and Jason’s course work had picked up as the semester progressed. Jason started going to the gym in the morning as he often stayed late on campus or at the coffee shop studying. In the evenings He and David usually arrived home around the same time. He liked to find his big man in the shower, and would often climb in with him. But, his favorite days were those when he arrived home before David. He would shower and then wait on their bed for David to get in from the gym. Jason loved the way David’s golden brown skin glistened after a workout and the sweet smell of his fresh sweat. David would come home to find Jason lying back naked playing with his tight ass or, his favorite, on all fours wearing a jockstrap with his ass up - offering his tight pink hole for David’s pleasure. Jason noticed David had two modes for sex, the lover and the beast. The lover would tenderly eat his sweet ass, kiss his body and gently loosen his hole with his big fingers while sucking his cock. When David was the beast, he would strip as soon as he walked in the house, releasing his huge throbbing cock, and would take Jason’s hole without any foreplay; fucking him ruthlessly.  Jason enjoyed both and liked the variety. <br />
<br />
David also notice the changes to Jason’s body as a result of the edits to the book. Jason was becoming leaner and had gained a little muscle. David loved the definition that was starting to show on the muscles of Jason’s firm round ass and sculpted legs. One day, David hid all of Jason’s underwear and replaced them with jockstraps. Jason actually loved it and only wore jockstraps from then on. <br />
<br />
One afternoon during the middle of the month, Jason was walking across campus when he felt a tap on his shoulder from behind. He turned and was startled to be facing the bottom Mark Lee’s huge pecs. <br />
<br />
“I hope I didn’t scare you Jason,” Mark said sincerely, “I was hoping you had a minute to talk.” <br />
<br />
“Really?” Jason said suspiciously. “I’m going to the coffee shop, if you want to walk with me.”  Jason felt he would be safer on the move and at least Steven would be at the coffee shop. <br />
<br />
“Thank you, I will.” Mark said as they started walking. “Look, I know I’ve been an ass hole. I owe both you and David an apology. I am sorry I bullied you and treated you so badly. I know it’s hard to believe, but I am trying to be a better person and I have a lot of things to apologize for.” <br />
<br />
Stunned, Jason replied “what has brought all this on?”<br />
<br />
“No bullshit,” Mark started, “I am constantly bullied and abused by my younger brother. I don’t like it much and I was in a dark place. I joined this meditation group which encouraged me to assess my own actions. I don’t like who I was.”<br />
<br />
Jason had stopped and was staring at Mark quizzically. Feeling that Mark was being honest, he asked if he wanted to sit on some benches near by and talk for a minute. <br />
<br />
Jason wanted to understand how Mark had become so cruel. Mark explained that he was 6’10” at 17 and weighed over 280 lbs by his 18th birthday. That men started asking to worship him and  little twinks would beg to be used by him. It was a lot for an 18 year old to process. His interaction with non-Asian men were always like that and it just became routine for him to be aggressive and dominant. By 20 he was 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his younger brother John was 7 feet tall at his 18th birthday and experienced the same interactions with littles. The brothers would joke about using their huge size to intimidate others, but Mark always thought John took it too seriously. In the last year, John first out grew Mark by an inch in height and on his dick. Though still lighter, that is when the taunting started. As John grew another inch and started to outmuscle Mark, it became almost unbearable.  Now that John is 2 inches taller, has a dick that is 2 inches longer and thicker, and outweighs his brother by 15 pounds, he makes Mark’s life miserable. <br />
<br />
“The first thing I hear every morning is ‘hey baby dick’ or ‘how can you be so small, big brother?’ and it gets old fast” Mark said finishing his story. “I’m hoping to get a place on my own soon and get some distance from John.” Mark continued, “Anyway, I’ve joined this group and am working on making apologies. I hope you and David can forgive me.”<br />
<br />
Amazed at the honesty, Jason said “I forgive you Mark, but I can’t speak for David. You will have ask him yourself.”<br />
<br />
Mark smiled genuinely pleased and cautiously pulled Jason into a hug to thank him. Being next Mark was enough to make Jason feel small. Being gently pressed against his gigantic torso, feeling the cobblestone ripples of his abdomen, made Jason feel positively tiny. Jason’s first thought was he couldn’t wait until David was that big. <br />
<br />
“You still going to the coffee shop?” Mark asked. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I have some studying to do before I go home,” Jason replied. <br />
<br />
“I’ll walk with you if that’s alright. I met a great guy at my meditation group and we’ve been hanging out for a couple of weeks. I’m supposed to meet him there this afternoon.” <br />
<br />
Jason was further surprised by the pleasant small talk he shared with Mark on the way. He found Mark to be a smart and thoughtful man; a far cry from the meathead ass hole persona he displayed at the gym. <br />
<br />
Jason was glad to see Steven when he walked into the coffee shop and Steven gave him the biggest smile. However, Jason quickly realized Steven was looking over his head and that Steven’s smile was for the giant now standing next to him. <br />
<br />
“Hey, big guy.” Steven said, “I’m glad you made it. Let me wait on my friend here and I’ll be right with you.” He continued, “hey Jason, a medium black coffee?”<br />
<br />
“Yes please,” Jason replied, then turning to Mark, “be good to him or I’ll destroy you.” <br />
<br />
Mark exaggerated a shiver and said “I will sir,” while grinning and kissing Steven’s cheek. <br />
<br />
Mark explained to Steven that he knew Jason from the gym and Jason left the new couple alone as he grabbed a table in the back to study. <br />
<br />
At dinner that evening, Jason was telling David about his encounter with Mark. As David was cutting into his third chicken breast, Jason said, “so don’t immediately punch him if he approaches you at the gym.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t,” David grinned. “Actually, I get it. When I was 6’2”, people at work would argue with me and clients would try to haggle. But as I have gotten bigger, it seems people become more compliant with every inch I gain. The non-Asians at the office won’t contradict me, even when I say the wrong thing just trying to illicit a response. Hell, even my Asian peers are hesitant to correct me now. My clients are so eager to please me, that my sales are going through the roof. There has been almost a 20% increase in my sales each month and with each inch I’ve grown. It kind of messes with your head having people act docile and subservient all the time, and I’m not as big as Mark.” David continued, “ and he is right about the locker room twinks. I’ve had two that were bold enough to tell me they wanted to serve me and that I could do whatever I wanted to them.”<br />
<br />
“Would you like that?” Jason asked. <br />
<br />
“No baby, yours is the only ass I need.” David answered putting his big hand on Jason’s leg under the table. <br />
<br />
After some consideration and feeling sorry for Mark because of the way John treated him, Jason decided to make some edits in the book. Jason also didn’t hate the idea of pissing on John’s parade. Jason went to his room while David was getting ready for bed. He had moved his desk in there and kept the book in its old hiding place. Taking out the book, he wrote, “if Mark Lee was being honest and if he will continue to be a better and kind person, he will grow 3 inches taller,  gain 45 pounds of muscle and 3 inches on his dick over the next 3 months. Also, he will become as lean as his brother John and his feet will grow to size 24s. However, if Mark reverts to bullying and cruel behavior, he will immediately stop growing.” Jason chuckled thinking of Steven’s delight. <br />
<br />
Measurement day for the end of 5th month came a few days later. Jason could hardly contain his excitement. He was sure that David had gained more than 15 pounds this month, the scale proved David had gained 19 pounds. He was 290 lbs. David let Jason lead him by the hand to the kitchen door. He stood against the door frame with an air of superiority.  David’s hard dick started to drip precum on Jason’s leg as Jason went up on his toes to make the mark. Taking the tape from Jason, David said, “let me.”  “79 inches, 6 freaking 7 baby. What do you think about that?” <br />
<br />
“You are a damn fine stud, and I want that dick in me.” Jason replied pleadingly. <br />
<br />
“Let me measure first.” David said running the tape down the length of his member. “14 and a half from tip to pubes. Do you think you can handle it?”<br />
<br />
Jason loved the cocky role play of measurement day. Grabbing a big wad of pre from David’s dripping steel pipe and rubbing  it on his quivering hole, he said, “there is only one way to find out.” <br />
<br />
David lifted Jason and inserted his monster cock into his waiting hole. With Jason’s hands on the counter supporting his upper body, David held his legs and fucked him savagely. Jason loved the depth of the penetration, his eyes rolled back as he covered his tight stomach with a 5 nice sprays of cum. David increased his thrusting at the sight, prolonging Jason orgasm and sending him into a state of ecstasy. Jason’s arms started shaking, threatening to give out. David grabbed him around the waist and pushed his cock even deeper. As David came, Jason could feel each blast flooding his guts with cum. He lost count at 12 but guessed there were 15 or 16 shots that were now leaking out of his ass and onto the counter and cabinets. It was hard to contain the mess when David came and every room in the house had been christened more than once. <br />
<br />
As the sixth month of David’s growth began, Jason was enjoying his own changing body. He looked leaner and harder each passing week and had gained a little over 6 pounds of muscle. Every morning he could stretch further and was now able to hold a full split for over a minute. His workouts  began with walking on the stair climber with a weighted vest, followed by weight training and stretches. His ass and legs were hard as rocks and David loved it. <br />
<br />
One morning, a couple of weeks into the sixth month, Mark was at the gym alone, grunting through heavy sets. Seeing Jason arrive,  he walked across the gym to say hello. As he approached, Jason noticed Mark’s huge frame looked fuller. <br />
<br />
“Good morning little man,” Mark said sweetly. “I’m glad to see a friend here so early.”<br />
<br />
“Morning giant man,” Jason replied. “When did you decide to join the morning crew?”<br />
<br />
“Yesterday!” Mark exclaimed, “I’ve finally had enough of my ass hole brother; he can workout by himself in the evening.  I gained five pounds and the prick had the nerve to tell me it was probably fat.” Pulling off his tank top, Mark asked “do you see any fat?”<br />
<br />
His immense muscles were well defined and his cobblestone 10 pack was beautiful. <br />
<br />
“No, but you didn’t have to take your shirt off” Jason said smiling, “I noticed you looked really pumped this morning.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks and sorry” Mark said slipping his shirt back on, “John’s shit pisses me off so much I overreact.” “How are you and David doing?”<br />
<br />
“We’re really good, both pretty busy lately.  How are things with Steven.”<br />
<br />
Mark almost blushed, “great, he is such an amazing man and so stupid handsome.” Jason could tell Mark was smitten.  Mark commented “I feel like I have a whole new wonderful life, being an ass hole was so exhausting and lonely.” <br />
<br />
“I’m glad for you Mark, you certainly seem happier.”<br />
<br />
Mark pulled the much smaller Jason into an awkward hug, pressing Jason into his abs. <br />
<br />
“Thanks man. I need to get back to my workout, I have class soon. Oh, if you see Steven, encourage him to come to the gym. I’ve been trying to get the lazy bastard in here for days.” Mark said. <br />
 <br />
“Will do, have a great workout.”<br />
<br />
Mark returned to his grueling sets and Jason slipped on his 45lbs vest and stepped on the stair climber. <br />
<br />
The next morning, Steven did join Mark. Jason spoke to them as they walked in and Mark winked at him, “it’s leg day.” <br />
<br />
As Jason finished his 30 minutes on the stair climber, a pale Steven came up to him “I think he’s trying to kill me.” Jason shook his head and teasingly said, “you East Asian men have it so easy. You already have a muscular body and I bet you never workout.” <br />
<br />
“I do push-ups and pull-ups at home. Don’t hate the genetics lottery,” Steven retorted. <br />
<br />
“I think your drill sergeant is looking for you.” <br />
<br />
“Shit, I better get back”<br />
<br />
Despite his miserable first day, Steven stuck with it. Jason saw them most mornings, and suspected Steven was mainly there to watch Mark lifting and pumping. <br />
<br />
During the this time, David continued to eat as much protein as he could and worked out like a beast. Sometimes, Jason thought he could tell David was growing day by day. <br />
Ming had a hard time keeping up with David, and David started cycling through lifting partners throughout the week. <br />
<br />
In the second week of the month, David and Jason had to pay a visit to Yoshida’s. David couldn’t get his feet into the eighteens anymore and had to wear the size 22 flip flops to the store. They we’re still oversized, but not by much. David swelled with pride when the salesman recommended size 20s. <br />
Jason thought David might shoot his load then and there, but David held it until they got home. Fucking Jason while wearing nothing but his new size 20 sneakers. <br />
<br />
On measurement day, Jason knew he was going to filled with David’s cum multiple times. David had become a titan and he knew it. The scale read 310 pounds. David was now 6’8” and had a thick fifteen inch member hanging over baseball sized balls. David fucked Jason in every room of the house that day. Anytime he would pass the door frame and see the 80inch mark or would realize he was over three hundred pounds, his huge dick would inflate and demand attention. Jason laid in bed with satisfaction the next day recuperating. David, being the truly sweet giant he was waited on his baby hand and foot that day.</p>
