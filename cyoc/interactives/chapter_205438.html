<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was even more difficult to be walking back into his former 4th grade classroom the following week, than he thought it would have been. Even though his new classmates and teacher were none the wiser, David still felt awkward and out of place as a former teenager who had finally just gotten his driver&#39;s permit. So much more awkward and out of place than he thought he would have felt. Almost like that one guy who had just turned 20 and was coming back to his high school as a senior that everyone made fun of.<br />
<br />
David was now stuck as a fourth grader. He felt weird. Out of place. Like a creeper, or a complete moron, having to walk back into this old elementary school classroom as one of its students. He thought the kids would start making fun of him, but quickly discovered he was the same height as them. Hell, he was SHORTER than most of the young boys he was surrounded by! Shorter, even, than many of the girls! Brad was small for his age, after all, and now David was the one that has to deal with that. <br />
<br />
David was also feeling more and more..... &quot;Off,&quot; throughout the past week. When he first woke up in Brad&#39;s body right after the operation, it was weird to him that being his little 8 year old brother didn&#39;t feel weird. But that feeling was somehow wearing off. He started thinking he should be taller, bigger, and stronger than he was. This little body began to feel out of place. He began to lose interest in the childish things Brad was interested in. Like piggyback rides.<br />
<br />
But he continued to retain the inability to properly pronounce his ls and rs most of the time. And in certain situations, pronounce an l when he should have pronounced an r instead. That was irritating and a form of humiliation for David. Especially in front of his oldest brother, Lucas. He decided he didn&#39;t like to speak in front of him anymore. What, with the childish prebubescent voice and all. Lucas was always snickering at the teen-turned-4th-grader. Luckily, Brad was a shy kid to begin with, and David inherited that shyness. His speech impediment he also inherited from Brad will render him even more shy.  <br />
<br />
Another thing was, he continued to retain Brad&#39;s level of education as well. He could barely do his 4th grade homework at home, and it was difficult to concentrate on it. He had to use his fingers for simple math, and still hasn&#39;t fully nemorized the harder times, like 8*8 and 8*7. Reading a clock when the hands were at odd angles was still difficult for him as well. He knew he had mastered those skills easily by second grade the first time as himself. But as Brad....he just wasn&#39;t as smart. Or rather, Brad was just plain lazy with his school work before the switch. Leaving David in a bind. Stuck at the lower end of 4th grade.<br />
<br />
But here he was. Entering Brad&#39;s classroom for the very first time. A classroom he still remembered when he thought he was bigger and older the first time around. Now, he felt small and childish. He wanted to hide, thinking all of his new classmates would see a 16 year old join them because he was retarded or something. <br />
<br />
It was weird that he seemingly fit in. His teacher towered over him, and all of his little classmates were more or less the same size as him! Most were actually taller than he was! He was looking eye-level at some of the shorter classmates, but most of them he actually had to look UP at! Brad, after all, was only in the 30th percentile for his size at his age. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; he thought. &quot;I have to actually look UP at a bunch of 8 year olds....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Bradley. Welcome back! Now please take your seat. I hope you stayed caught up on all the work I sent home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mrs. S...&quot; He said in his soft childish voice, still cringing at being called &quot;Bradley.&quot; <br />
<br />
His mother forced him to sit down and do all of the work sent home to him. As much as he hated it, at least he now has something to show for it at school. He dug around in Brad&#39;s little backpack and pulled out his folders of homework he completed. She came over and collected it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Bradley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok class, settle down, finish putting your things in your cubbies, and take your seats!&quot;<br />
<br />
David groaned. &quot;Cubbies.&quot; &quot;Just great,&quot; he thought. &quot;Just another reminder that I&#39;m just a little kiddie.... A &quot;cubbie&quot; instead of a locker....&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire day was miserable for little David. Being treated like a little kid and having to play along with it. When the day finally ended, he was picked up by a beaming Bradley driving his mom&#39;s car! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, little dude! I got my licesense today during free activity period at school! Mom and dad said I could drive mom&#39;s car to pick you up from my old school! Check it out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bradley in David&#39;s body pulled out David&#39;s wallet, from David&#39;s back pants pocket, and flashed him a card with his own smiling face printed on an official driver&#39;s license! <br />
<br />
This just made David grumpy. He waited 16 years to be able to drive, and only got to drive twice with his permit. Now he&#39;s gotta sit in Bradley&#39;s booster seat in the back as he only weighed in at 50 lbs soaking wet, and wait another 8 years!  His feet couldn&#39;t even touch the floor yet! <br />
<br />
David stood outside the vehicle, lip beginning to quiver. &quot;This just isn&#39;t fair! I should be the big boy! Not Bradley!&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. What&#39;s up, little dude?&quot; asked a concerned Brad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. Hop on in,&quot; he said as he opened the rear door to herd his new little brother into the rear and towards his little kid&#39;s booster seat. <br />
<br />
David obviously had no choice. He had to get home after all, and this was his only means of transportation. To be chaparoned by his little brother inside his old body. Forced to sit in a booster seat in the rear with a perfectly good front seat open. He couldn&#39;t even see out of the front windshield very well. He had to be content with just looking out of his side rear window. David remained silent for duration of the ride home, as his now bigger brother, formerly himself, tried to strike up cheerful conversations with the sullen little guy. Eventually giving up the effort halfway home.<br />
<br />
Getting back home, Lucas was pulling into the driveway ahead of them. He got out and walked to the side so Brad could pull in next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, DAVID, I see you finally got your license!&quot; he said through the front open window to Bradley. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! I got it today! See?&quot; he said, pulling it out again. <br />
<br />
Looking in the rear at an angry little kid sitting in his booster seat, Lucas snickered and said;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, BRADLEY, David is now practically an adult! He&#39;s got YOUR license!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, man. He&#39;s had a rough day. Leave him alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having his former kid brother defend him was now the latest humiliation for David.</p>
