<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Our episode title, song quote, and inspiration are from Bryan Adams&#39; <i>Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?</i></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; admitted Ben Twist, as he walked into his backyard.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked his girlfriend Kenya Adaeze, who was by his side.<br />
&quot;Frances&#39; position on whether I get to play flag football Thanksgiving Day. Both she and Samantha had no problem with me participating in the exhibition game last year, and that was full contact football.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand,&quot; replied Kenya, concerned for her boyfriend.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve must have seen such games on TV before,&quot; said Ben, to which Kenya simply shrugged. &quot;The point is I didn&#39;t get hurt then. There&#39;s even less chance of me getting hurt this year, but she says no?&quot;<br />
&quot;I cannot explain a mother&#39;s actions but, even if we do not understand them, I know they always try to do what they think best for their children,&quot; said Kenya, moving closer to him. &quot;Despite how tough things were for us in New York, when my mother first suggested sending me here to live with my aunt and uncle, I was shocked that she was willing to break up our family. Yet now that I am here,&quot; she added, while affectionately running her fingers through Ben&#39;s hair, &quot;it has given me the one thing I lacked to make my life complete. You,&quot; said Kenya, before affectionately kissing him.<br />
<br />
Ben relished their lips touching.<br />
A part of him just wanted to claim the lady and howl out how much he loved her.<br />
Instead, he simply stared at her and said, &quot;I love you too, but it still doesn&#39;t explain Frances.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. It does not,&quot; agreed Kenya. &quot;But will whether or not you compete in one game have such an impact upon your life?&quot;<br />
Ben stared deeply into Kenya&#39;s eyes. For a moment, he thought he saw something more than just the love they had for each other. <i>But that&#39;s just wishful thinking. Isn&#39;t it?</i> he asked himself.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; finally admitted Ben, leaning against his girlfriend and enjoying the comfort of her closeness. &quot;But I still wish I understood Frances&#39; position on the matter.&quot;<br />
&quot;For all I know, maybe Frances doesn&#39;t understand it herself,&quot; guessed Kenya. &quot;All I can say is that both your mothers love you very much. They want what&#39;s best for you, and so do I,&quot; she added, before kissing him again.<br />
Their lips lingered for far longer than just one kiss, as Kenya and Ben began to undress each other.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, inside the Twist house...<br />
&quot;Are you all right dear?&quot; Samantha asked her wife.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Frances, still leaning against her mate on the living room sofa. &quot;The whole thing with Ben hurts,&quot; she confessed.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Samantha, doing her best to comfort Frances. &quot;It is just one game, and safer than last year&#39;s.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. But something just keeps nagging at me that Ben shouldn&#39;t play.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it... because of me?&quot; Samantha wanted to know.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Frances, turning her head to stare at her wife. &quot;How can you ask such a thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;You know I can&#39;t give you children the way you really want. So—&quot;<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; exclaimed Frances, squirming around to face her. &quot;I may be hoping for the impossible, wanting to become pregnant with <i>our</i> child some day, but only as an expression of how much I love you. I want to shout to the world that I&#39;m a happily married lesbian werecat, and that you&#39;re mine and I&#39;m yours.&quot;<br />
The other Mrs. Twist smiled at that. &quot;But the whole situation with Ben...&quot; began Samantha.<br />
&quot;I know dearest,&quot; conceded Frances, while leaning against Samantha. &quot;I love being a mother, but Ben is growing up. Maybe not tomorrow, but someday he won&#39;t really need us in his life like he has in the past. He&#39;ll be a man. A husband, let alone a father, probably to Kenya and their cubs. I know we&#39;ll still have and love each other, but I  want more.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Frances. Really it is,&quot; promised Samantha, while holding her close. &quot;Maybe, like I said before, we can apply for at least guardianship of another child in need again, if not outright adoption.&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought after Ben left, you wanted to try being empty nesters for a while before we opened our door to help someone else?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
<br />
Samantha held her wife tighter. &quot;Maybe. I don&#39;t know. Whatever makes you happy.&quot;<br />
&quot;You make me happy, my love,&quot; replied Frances, before kissing her.<br />
&quot;After that shoot out next door with Dymixious Drake*, I&#39;ve been so worried about you,&quot; confessed Samantha. &quot;If I ever lost you...&quot;<br />
Seeing the fear in her mate&#39;s eyes, Frances would not admit just how afraid she was, being alone in the house when a stray bullet came through their bedroom window. &quot;You&#39;ve got me until the end of time. I love you Mrs. Twist,&quot; swore Frances, passionately kissing Samantha. <br />
&quot;And I love you Mrs. Twist,&quot; said Samantha.<br />
The married couple continued to hold each other and kiss.<br />
Frances snuggled closer to her wife, as Samantha loving caressed her.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before fur began covering their bodies as they started to purr...<br />
<br />
OUTSIDE...<br />
The werepanthress was on top of her werewolf, happily riding his lupine rocket toward ecstasy. Her paws were pressed against his furry chest, but he relished every moment.<br />
A smile crossed Ben&#39;s muzzle as his paws held Kenya.<br />
The only thing that mattered was his woman, who was growling in pleasure as she quickened her pace.<br />
Ben raised his hips to meet her needs, panting from both the exertion and desire to fulfill her every need.<br />
Soon wolf and panthress expressed their pleasure both physically and verbally as they joined as one in orgasmic bliss.<br />
Spent, Kenya laid on top of him before rolling slightly to one side so she could hold him better.<br />
Not that Ben would be parting company with her any time soon, even if his lupine top knot wasn&#39;t buried deep within her.<br />
&quot;Do you know how much I love you?&quot; Ben asked, between caresses and kisses.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; was all Kenya would say, nuzzling closer to him.<br />
&quot;Someday,&quot; Ben began to say, thinking about how, after high school graduation, he would propose and she would become Mrs. Kenya Twist.<br />
&quot;To our future, my darling werewolf,&quot; Kenya said happily, as a smile crossed her muzzle.<br />
As their lips touched romantically again, Ben stared at her and recalled the words from an old song.<br />
&#9835;When you can see your unborn children in her eyes...&#9835;<br />
His heart skipped a beat as he held the love of his life closer.<br />
<br />
INSIDE...<br />
It was different this time.<br />
Still as passionate as ever between them, but different.<br />
Frances was the aggressor this time, provided the term could be appropriately used under the circumstances.<br />
The Twists always alternated who led their latest dance of love, with no one keeping score as to whose turn it was.<br />
Frances used her werecat claws to practically rip her wife&#39;s clothing off Samantha&#39;s fur covered body.<br />
Each new tasty tidbit of feline flesh was either kissed, licked, and/or sucked as the usually meek woman sexually pursued Samantha, working her way to what awaited between furry legs.<br />
Pulling her mate down onto the living room floor so they&#39;d have more room, Frances hastily undressed herself as her tongue attacked Samantha&#39;s vagina, drinking deeply of her fluids and ravishing her clit like there was no tomorrow.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s gotten into you honey?&quot; Samantha asked, noting that Frances&#39; tail was swishing in time with her talented tongue. Not that Samantha minded experiencing three orgasms in rapid succession, but this was unlike Frances.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know honey,&quot; conceded her wife. &quot;I just need you. Desire you. Want you. NOW!&quot;<br />
&quot;Then take me darling,&quot; replied Samantha, adjusting the position of her body to make sure Frances got everything she wanted.<br />
<br />
Frances felt a hunger growing within her that could not be sated.<br />
After her wife came for the fourth time, Frances licked her lips seductively while staring longingly at Samantha.<br />
Then Frances started to move.<br />
At first Samantha thought Frances would be initiating a 69 session of mutual oral pleasure.<br />
Instead, Frances positioned herself until their cunts were against each other.<br />
Then Frances started rubbing her pussy up against her favorite pussy as if she was fucking Samantha.<br />
Samantha realized at once what her mate was attempting to do.<br />
<i>We haven&#39;t tribbed in ages,</i> she thought, knowing the practice of two women rubbing their cunts together to eventually achieve orgasm, <i>but if this is what Frances wants...</i><br />
Frances just smiled to discover a willing participant as Samantha started moving in time with her actions.<br />
The two werecats started purring and growling louder. Each wanting to make sure the other came first.<br />
Frances reached out as her paws started teasing and fondling the hard nipples of her wife&#39;s breasts.<br />
Samantha wasted no time returning the favor.<br />
Each woman felt themselves drawing closer to the edge, but neither wanted to fall off the proverbial cliff of orgasmic bliss without the other.<br />
<br />
Despite letting Frances lead, Samantha knew she was close and couldn&#39;t wait any longer.<br />
Her paws left her wife&#39;s breasts and reached out to grab Frances&#39; butt cheeks.<br />
With one final upward thrust, Samantha&#39;s extended clit hit Frances&#39; clit as both came together.<br />
The last thing either woman could recall was seeing a white light...<br />
<br />
How long she was out, Samantha couldn&#39;t say.<br />
As consciousness slowly returned, Mrs. Twist felt a pleasurable weight upon her furry body and someone showering her with a plethora of kisses.<br />
&quot;I really love you so much Samantha,&quot; purred Frances, between kissing every furry part of her wife&#39;s head, face, neck, and shoulders that she could reach without moving the rest of her body.<br />
&quot;And I love you darling,&quot; Samantha said, pulling Frances closer to her.<br />
The two of them just laid there on the floor, lying within each others arms.<br />
Each werecat purred in loving contentment between romantic smooches until they fell asleep in the living room.<br />
