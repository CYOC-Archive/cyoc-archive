<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vixi said, &quot;So many places to see! I wanna see&#39;em all!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there farm girl, we&#39;ll have plenty of time!&quot; Raynar smiled. &quot;And if not... we can just do a montage right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vixi stared for a moment confused, then smiled and nodded. &quot;Oh... right, a montage!&quot; Why hadn&#39;t you thought of that before? It was so obvious, so natural.<br />
<br />
Raynar went the window and pulled the drapes closed. &quot;But first... wanna have some REAL fun?&quot; He looked lovingly into your rubber eyes.<br />
<br />
You and Raynar had both agreed to wait until marriage, instead of treating it like just another act of pleasure as had been the unhealthy trend for civilization. <br />
<br />
And that made it all the sweater and all the more golden. You leapt at Raynar and pinned him to the bed like a professional wrestler! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I thought I was supposed to be the wild one!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Forest boy, I&#39;m gonna show you how wild this farm girl can be!&quot; You grinned. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The forever present camera then switched to the outside of the hotel. The sun zipped down as the moon zipped up. The hotel began to bang left and right like it was made of rubber and a cannon ball was being bounced around inside it! 1920s swing music began to play wildly as the hotel hopped off its foundations. Rocket ships fired off at the sci-fi genre district, and fireworks went off in the anime genre district, followed by flowers booming in the cutsey-wutsey genre district. Puffs of smoke shot out of the windows before finally everything settled down. The moon zipped out and the sun zipped back up. <br />
<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Raynar and Vixi calmly traveled won the elevator, Raynar again holding the travel brochure. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we&#39;re going to see everything, let&#39;s start with the A, &#39;a for anime&#39;, mecha battle field sound good?&quot; Raynar offered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Might be interesting,&quot; Vixi said, not really thinking so, but she did say she wanted to see everything. <br />
<br />
She glanced at her husband, her eyes wandered to the space between Raynar&#39;s legs... shouldn&#39;t there have been something there? She looked at the space between her own legs, seeing the smooth rubber. There HAD been something there before... but she couldn&#39;t remember what. Oh well, if it was really that important she wouldn&#39;t have forgotten it! <br />
<br />
She noticed the black outline around herself and Raynar, no matter what angle she looked at him or herself, there was a black outline around them. Had that... been there before? But... why... why wouldn&#39;t it? Vixi searched her memories, and couldn&#39;t recall it... NOT being there. <br />
<br />
The happy ding of the elevator snapped her out of her confusion, and the married couple stepped out. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you two are shaping up nicely,&quot; Rosey Skunkette from behind her reception remarked looking them up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Raynar said as the pair left the hotel and waved for a taxi. <br />
<br />
An empty taxi cab indeed stopped in front of them... with a toon&#39;s face on the front. The door opened on its own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Come in! Name&#39;s Tex!&quot; The taxi cab said. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much?&quot; Vixi asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;How much&#39;? HA! What made you think &#39;money&#39; had anything to do with this story?! I&#39;m just a plot device to get you two love birds where ya want to go! I&#39;m fulfilling my role in the Script, and that&#39;s good enough for me!&quot; <br />
<br />
The Script... that word floated in Vixi&#39;s mind... yes... the Script... the Script was all... the Script guided all. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Anime Giant Robots Arena!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You got it mac!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name isn&#39;t mac, it Raynar!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two rubber foxes crammed into the little yellow taxi. Tex took off with a zoom. They zipped past the mixed bag of varying anime styles, until the building all had a more detailed but more static design, and the majority of toons were kids in school uniforms wielding magic wands, or katanas, or having cute little pet monsters on their shoulders. There was also the incredibly busty cat girls, bunny girls, wolf girls, and dragon girls, many wearing french maid outfits, others having fur patterned like swim suits. The &#39;wandering samurai&#39; wandered about, and there was the robot girls of course standing at attention. <br />
<br />
Tex stopped them right in front of a truly gigantic arena. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go! Plot convenience should have some seat waiting for ya. Happy to be of service. Just watch out for that scene transition.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vixi began to ask, &quot;What scene-&quot; They were sitting in a crowd of various anime characters circling an arena covered in grass paint white lines. &quot;-Transition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky they had seat for us right dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear,&quot; Vixi nodded. <br />
<br />
A platform covered above the arena, made of metal supported by glowing blue rings underneath.<br />
<br />
There were two announcers on the platform. The first was a blond &#39;nekomimi&#39; cat girl with pigtails and a cowboy hat, with raggy jean shorts, cowboy boots, and a tubtop covered by an open vest. Her clawed hands covered by sparkling fingerless gloves. She had huge blue eyes. <br />
<br />
The other was an anthro cat man naked from the waist up. He was wearing a pair of blue jeans and plain sandals. His hair was long and as white as his fur, he had the face of a movie star and golden eyes. <br />
<br />
It couldn&#39;t be said that the Anime District didn&#39;t objectify-sexualize both sexes. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! I&#39;m Yuri!&quot; said the cat girl excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am Jinn,&quot; said the cat man stoically. <br />
<br />
&quot;And welcome to another exciting battle at the Anime Valhalla Battlefield! Where there&#39;s always more battles, and more giant robots!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for our next match for those of us just tuning in at home, on one side we have Prince Yomi, and his mecha the Black Knight!&quot;<br />
<br />
From one side of the arena rose a giant robot made of black metal with golden welding edges, with polished smooth sides and shaped like a knight in shining armor. On top of was a pale man with white hair and blue eyes with a scar across his face. His was dressed in a manner that was almost identical to his robot. He was carrying a sheathed long sword. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is war? What is peace? Can there be war without peace? But can there be peace without war?&quot; He said, sparkles floating around him.<br />
<br />
Several of the ladies in the audience fawned over the sight of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;And his opponent for the day! Her back story is yet undecided. Is she the child of an brilliant scientist? Is she a scout sent by aliens? Did she accidentally stumble into the cockpit of a mysterious left behind super weapon? We don&#39;t know yet, and neither does she! But what she lacks in backstory she&#39;s willing to make up for in drive and ambition! Meet Mimiko and the Wild Victory!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another mecha rose from the opposite side of the arena, it looked strangely familiar to Vixi, like she&#39;d seen it before. Like in a dream. It was less lavishly designed than the Black Knight, having a basically white and blue color scheme, with the individual panels more invisible, more stocky, and with the joints more visible. Though it did have a pair of metal cat ears atop it. And a set of three energy blades on each arm like ninja claws. <br />
<br />
The pilot standing on top of the machine was a red haired cat girl, red like bright firetruck red. She wore a blue and white stripped swim suit of all things with bright blue boots and gloves. Her skin didn&#39;t any marks on it at all, like most anime characters. Golden eyes stared determined out at Prince Yomi. Her tail swatted pensively behind her. She crouched like she was the one about to fight rather than her machine as Prince Yomi stood cooly on his machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the underdog here! That means I&#39;m gonna win! So let&#39;s do this!&quot; She shouted defiantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such pretentiousness, someone needs to put you in your place little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do these look &#39;little girl to you?!&quot; Mimiko pointed at her bosom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Figure does not equal maturity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least ONE of our fighters is fired up! Fighters to your cockpits!&quot; Yuri shouted into her hand microphone. <br />
<br />
The two mecha pilots did as they were asked, and both machines powered up, icy blue eyes glowed from the Black Knight, and yellow from the Wild Victory. A transparent hexagon pattern force field appeared between the arena and the audience. <br />
<br />
&quot;BEGIN!&quot; Yuri shouted. <br />
<br />
The two mecha charged, a giant laser sword emerged the Black Knight&#39;s arm that was caught by Wild Victory&#39;s shorter laser claws. The battle had begun! But who would win? YOU decide dear reader/writer! Be with us next time! For &#39;What a Metal Knight!&#39; or &#39;Techno Kitty Hijinks!&#39;</p>
