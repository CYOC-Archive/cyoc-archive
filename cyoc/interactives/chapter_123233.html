<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up later still seeing the sun looming over my head. I stood up and stretched my wings, tail and everything else on my body. I looked in my bed and saw my slave sleeping soundly, her womb still wet with our sexual fluids, and her mouth had slight traces of my milk. I took pride in her work and smiled and I rubbed the scales on her cheek gently with my claw and sighed happily as I stood up.<br />
<br />
My cave home wasn&#39;t too special yet, the only thing it had was a bed currently, but I plan to turn it into a grand palace for my master and I to bask in the world he will soon own. Not long later I heard my slave murmuring and soon I saw her eyes open wide and at first she screamed,&quot;What the....?!?!&quot; I covered my ears on instinct, and she looked at her body and blushed heavily, and looked at me.<br />
<br />
In response to her scream I growled,&quot;Dear god slave could you make a moment even more unsettling?!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then looked up at me and whimpered,&quot;I....I....please don&#39;t...harm me...it&#39;s just that....it wasn&#39;t a dream was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and sat next to her and said,&quot;I should have expected this I suppose, but then again it is quite rude to greet your mistress in such a fashion. Let&#39;s try that again, and then we can prepare to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave paused and looked up at me puzzled,&quot;L...leave? Wh...where will we go? What will we do? Wh...what will h...happen to....&quot; she began but then I put my finger over her mouth and shushed her, and said,&quot;Now now, what use would you be to me if you weren&#39;t by my side? Besides, and don&#39;t lie, we enjoyed every second of each other, and I want to feel that way again. Hmmm, perhaps I should build a harem, it sure would be fun if there was more than just one of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave paused then whimpered as she looked down at her six breasts naked body. Then I smiled and brought put my finger under her chin, and turned her head to face me. I then chuckled and said,&quot;Worry not my slave, you&#39;ll adjust to your new body. Besides I can always make you better like so.&quot; I then brought my claws around and cupped her ass, I channeled my magic through them. My claws gave off a subtle red glow and my slave&#39;s hips grew out wider slightly, and her ass became larger.<br />
<br />
My slave watched as her body changed and blushed, and I grinned at her,&quot;Don&#39;t worry my slave, or should I call you wife? I know you were once a princess, and I promise that I will give you just as much attention as you once had, and more. Besides you&#39;ll always be my favorite one, once my harem builds up.&quot; I said then I turned her head towards mine again, and kissed her on the mouth and got a taste of her mouth. My slave paused when I kissed her then she backed away from me looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...why are you doing th...this?&quot; She whimpered then I looked at her and chuckled,&quot;Because you are my breeding slave now, and I will take pride in your health, and your position. You should do the same towards me for our sake, and for the sake of the many eggs of mine you&#39;ll bear inside your womb, and possibly others.&quot; <br />
<br />
My slave looked at me looking afraid and again I smiled,&quot;Now join me outside when you&#39;re ready to leave, and please be haste. I&#39;m being generous when I ask you to be prompt.&quot; I then walked away towards the door and then I felt something grab my tail and I turned around to see my slave&#39;s claw around it. She gave me a worried expression when I turned around, and she said,&quot;S..sorry, b...but wh...where are the cl...clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned at her and patted her on the head,&quot;My silly wife, you aren&#39;t like one of those disgraceful succubi you needn&#39;t give men suspense by covering your beautiful breasts, or your lovely womb. Just lick yourself clean and meet me outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
I walked out the entrace and behind me as I walked outside and leaned against the entrance of the cave. After about 10 minutes she walked out and she was covering her body with her wings, and I saw her and shook my head and sighed,&quot;Wife, why do you embarrass yourself like that? I am your husband, wife and mistress, and whatever you look like reflects on me. Now come to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
My slave slowly made her way over to me, and I opened her wings and hugged her close. She paused blushing and I proceeded to cup her ass and massage it slowly. She blushed and looked at me and said,&quot;Wh...what are you..doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and kissed her cheek,&quot;I&#39;m proving a point, don&#39;t hate the feeling it&#39;s a good thing to feel. Call me Mistress, Mistress Drahafra my wife.&quot; I continue to massage her ass then I proceeded to lick her lick her nipples one at a time with my long, forked tongue. She moans softly when I do, and I begin to slowly suck and I drink her sweet demonic milk. She moans a bit more and blushes, and then I swept her off of her feet into my arms, and she looks up at me blushing.<br />
<br />
I then grinned and said,&quot;How can something that feels so good be so bad to witness publicly? Wether it be this, nursing, egg laying, or lovers having sex, it should all be seen. Your humans say we are impure that we must be exterminated, but we demons are the only truly pure ones. We enjoy ourselves without the restraint of dignity you just need to grow accustomed to these feelings, and I will be more that happy to teach you.&quot; I then teased her nipples with my tongue and she blushed and nodded.<br />
<br />
I smiled and lowered her to the ground and hugged her again,&quot;Now, come along my wife. Soon enough I will make your lovely womb bloated with eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave hugged me back and said,&quot;I...I&#39;m not sure about this..M...Mistress.&quot; In response I smiled and hugged her closer and said,&quot;Don&#39;t worry now, you won&#39;t need to experience disgusting humanity anymore. You already sealed your fate by drinking my milk, and allowing me to cum into your womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave blushed and closed her eyes and she began crying,&quot;S...so I...c....can&#39;t go back t...to......to..m...my p...parents?&quot; I then frowned and thoughts of my parents suddenly flashed in my mind, and I sighed,&quot;I...I&#39;m sorry but after what I carry out our lord&#39;s plan then they will either be no more, or you won&#39;t recognize them, and they will already only see you as one of us. I...in a way can relate, but....I don&#39;t wish to speak about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave looked into my eyes and just hugged my tighter, her head laying against my breasts and her tears into my cleavage. I wasn&#39;t sure if I said the right thing, so I hugged her back and said,&quot;Let it all out wife, the sooner the better. I...I will try my best to spare them if I can, b..but if they come around stay quiet, understand?&quot; My slave then nodded and sniffled wiping her tears,&quot;I....I&#39;d like that...Mistress....Drahafra.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and released my slave and smiled,&quot;It&#39;s unlikely that we will encounter them, so just relax, and feel free to please your curiosity with your body, and don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help.&quot; I grinned seductively and she nodded blushing, and I began walking I looked back and she was walking with me. The feeling was comforting in a way, venturing with another even if it wasn&#39;t entirely willing on her part. I guided her on foot because she couldn&#39;t fly. Eventually we came to a large stone building that looked abandoned for centuries, and Immediately recognized it as another temple almost by instinct. My own magic was drawing me towards it and I looked back to see my slave&#39;s face awestruck.<br />
<br />
I looked at her and smiled,&quot;I see you are intrigued by lord Nitrosinous&#39;s temple, for now you should know our only objective is to find these. We will be given other objectives too after that, but even I don&#39;t know them yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave nodded,&quot;S...so what now? I...I&#39;ve never seen this before.&quot; I paused and read her mind, and she wasn&#39;t lying I looked at the temple and said to my slave,&quot;I&#39;m not sure either, so wait outside for me, and hide if anyone comes. That is unless you think you can kill a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
My slave paused then bowed her head respectively and her mind indicated that she knew her place,&quot;Yes Mistress, wh...what will you do in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
I put my claws on my slave&#39;s shoulders,&quot;Don&#39;t you worry my slave, I will just learn something new is all. I&#39;ll go into detail when I return.&quot; My slave nodded and sat down where she was, and I entered the temple. There wasn&#39;t much at first except for a pond, as I walked torches lit up by my side. I then entered a large room and there was a pond there. I peered into the pond and torches immediately lit up the entire room, then from the pond emerged a stone with an odd glowing symbol on it.<br />
<br />
The stone floated towards me and I touched it, and it immediately turned into cinders. I thought that I did something wrong at first, but then suddenly new knowledge was pouring into my mind, and my runes on my body began glowing. I felt it, I was gaining the knowledge of a new magic and when I felt the knowledge stop pouring in. I felt stronger, but not just in the new magic I had learned, but in my old transformation magic too. I then grinned and walked out to see my slave and smiled and I told her,&quot;I now know everything about ______ magic.&quot;</p>
