<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bates opened the door. There was a tall woman in the doorway, her clothing seemed to flicker.  The timeline <br />
was still adjusting. Her former pink car coat had become black leathers. Bates recognized her from Parents <br />
Day, and wondered just how good his curse had been.  It was Mrs. Higgenbottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Mrs. Higgenbottom, how can I help you?&quot; Bates asked, as his hurdy gurdy music droned to a halt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me?&quot; she asked suspiciously. She pushed herself into Bates' room and looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;W?&quot; Bates asked unsure what to do.<br />
<br />
She looked around the room. &quot;No nothing familiar. Have I been here before?  How do you know me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, oh, no you've never been in my room before.  I think you were at Stonewood for the Founders Day <br />
Ceremonies, weren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bates knew that Malfoy had gotten the job as RA because his parents were former alums.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Higgenbottom seemed lost in thought. She muttered to herself, &quot;Yes, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bates noticed for the first time that Monkeyboy was not standing where he had been. Bates looked around the <br />
room and out the open window. Where had Monkeyboy got to?  He needed to distract Mrs. Bates and get her out of <br />
his room, so he could find Monkeyboy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think you were with Mr. Higgenbottom?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Higgenbottom?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, tall man with a bowler and umbrella?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was strangely silent.<br />
<br />
John Higgenbottom had been an agent in the service of the Ministries of Magic.  He had vanished overseas while <br />
obtaining key information about the Union of Soviet Socialist Convens. <br />
<br />
A voice from the open doorway said, &quot;Not Mr. Higgenbottom, but me.  John Diamond - it's easy to remember <br />
&quot;What's harder than steel?  Diamond.  I was Mrs. Higgenbottom's escort to the Founder's Day soiree last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man looked a lot like Higgenbottom, but he was an inch shorter and his jaw was less rugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry I just assumed you were-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind,&quot; Diamond said glancing at his watch, &quot;Mrs. Higgenbottom, we are needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, then I'm off. Sorry to have bothered you -&quot; she paused scanning the room and spotting what she <br />
needed, &quot;Mr. Bates.&quot; Then she left.<br />
<br />
Bates closed the door. Leaned his back against the door, sighed in relief, and glance upward at the ceiling.  <br />
There was Monkey boy high up in a gable lodging himself in place with his feet.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the hallway, Diamond asked, &quot;Alright, Mrs. Higgenbottom, what's going on?  Why are you here at Stonewood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew, Diamond, I wish I knew. I think I had a premonition, but I cannot recall it now.  I am certain <br />
that boy is involved somehow.  He lied about knowing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come now, Mrs. Higgenbottom, he must have seen you and me at the soiree last year.  You are a striking <br />
woman, and he's just an underclassman. You certainly would have made an impression on me if you had turned up <br />
while I was school.  I bet he fantasized meeting you, and when you showed up at his door, he was astounded and <br />
confused. Fantasies don't usually come true.&quot;  As he talked, he walked briskly leading Mrs. Higgenbottom <br />
through the labyrinthian maze of corridors that make up the Stonewood Academy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You present a powerful argument, but my woman's intuition tells me I'm right and you're wrong. So why are you <br />
here?  I didn't even know I was going here until I got here. Were you following me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your woman's intuition may have something. The Ministry of Magic transported me here to investigate an <br />
anomaly. And by good fortune, I find you here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of anomaly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's part of why we are here to investigate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm on the case?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, ahead of me as usual. I suppose, we should go visit your old friend the dean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never answered my question about the anomaly, Diamond?&quot; Higgenbottom pointed out as the arrived at the <br />
main door to the Dean's rooms. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I didn't.  Because no one can remember what it was just that there was something, and we all forgot what. <br />
So we are here to find out what we forgot. It must be important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone rewrote the timeline,&quot; Higgenbottom said decidedly, &quot;That's why I forgot my premonition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most likely. But the problem now is to figure out what was rewritten and whether it should be undone or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not undone? Why not?&quot; she felt a definite certainty that it had to be reverse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we don't remember what happened, but maybe it was a terrorist attack on Stonewood. Perhaps all the <br />
students were killed. That might be why your conversation with Bates was so disquieting, perhaps he should be <br />
dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps. Let's test that theory,&quot; she said reaching out and yanking an underclasswoman out of her chair. She <br />
demanded, &quot;Who are you and what has been going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wide eyed girl stammered, dropped her books and started to cry. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Professor Brewster suspected I was cheating because my marks improved, and of course <br />
he was right. I used a set of enchanted pencils. I put one in the brightest kid's desk, and then my other <br />
pencil copied all his answers on the test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Higgenbottom, so good to see you.  Thank you for clearing my calender by so expeditiously extracting a <br />
confession from Miss Wandstrom.  You will turn over the pencils to Mr. Brewster, and then you will retake all <br />
your exams with an automatic one letter grade markdown without the aid of magic. Now get going, Miss <br />
Wandstrom.&quot;  As the bouncy coed gathered her books and rushed off, the dean turned his full attention to Mrs. <br />
Higgenbottom and Mr. Diamond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Mrs. Higgenbottom, as much as I appreciate your interrogation skills, why are you here. Business or <br />
pleasure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's always a pleasure to see you, Dean, but I'm afraid it's business this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I was afraid so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Wandstrom involved?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. And no, Diamond, there's not the same feeling I had from Bates. So there goes your theory about Stonewood <br />
being destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Destroyed?&quot; asked the dean with alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't fret, Dean, we're here because we don't know. Mrs. Higgenbottom is just being a tad melodramatic, and <br />
I'm afraid I contributed. Somehow the timeline has been changed, and Stonewood Academy is the epicenter of the <br />
disturbance. The magic was done by powerful wizard or wizards unknown. It was effective enough to obscure what  <br />
was altered, but no enough to mask the ripples completely which reach back decades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He said he saw me with Mr. Higgenbottom,&quot; Mrs. Higgenbottom said firmly, and he didn't seem to recognize you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But John Higgenbottom was lost over two decades ag- oh,&quot; the dean stopped lecturing with a sudden <br />
realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you suppose agents of the Soviet Coven are at work?&quot; the dean asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some nefarious deed or deeds have been committed. We'll find out who and what or I'll wager I'll heat my <br />
hat,&quot; Diamond said emphatically.<br />
<br />
Higgenbottom smirked and tapped Diamond's bowler.  It made a metallic ping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd almost be willing to fail just to see you try to eat that hat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a figure of speech, woman!&quot; Diamond protested.<br />
<br />
Back in Bates' room, Bates was lying with his head in his ape man's lap, while the ape man plucked grapes and <br />
fed them to his master. Bates had been so distracted by Mrs. Higgenbottom's appearance, he hadn't noticed that <br />
the grape going into his mouth was dropping from between the ape man's big toe and 2nd toe. The ape man's <br />
hands were occupied with a magic tome.  The hurdy gurdy hadn't erased all of Malfoy's memories. If he <br />
concentrated the part of him that remained could still read. He was going to improve his master whether his <br />
master wanted it or not.  A spell to make him exercise would be a good start.  He plucked another grape with <br />
his toes and fed his master, as he turned the page.</p>
