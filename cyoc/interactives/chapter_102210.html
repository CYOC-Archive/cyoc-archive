<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam told Stacy the whole truth.  He felt she deserved to know everything.  He explained how he got the keychain flashlight, how it worked, and what he had done with it.  When he told Stacy about using it to give her a penis, she scowled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that.  I wasn&#39;t trying to hurt you, and I was going to change you back.  I promise.  Are you mad?&quot; asked Sam softly.<br />
<br />
Stacy sighed.  &quot;You know, I should be.  But for some reason, I kind of like it, &quot; said Stacy, as she peeked at her equipment in her sling undergarments.  &quot;It feels right.  In my memories I have always had it, and it hasn&#39;t ever been a problem.  It certainly hasn&#39;t hurt my modeling career.  In fact, I have always kind of wanted it to be a little bigger. &quot;<br />
<br />
Stacy&#39;s eyes suddenly lit up and she looked at the device in her hand.  With hesitation, she switched the light to blue and aimed it at her groin.  She pressed the button and a dark blue light shot out. The bulge in her sling suddenly began to get larger.  The head of her dick poked out of the top and started to snake up her abdomen.  Two small testicles dropped out form underneath the sling.  Underneath the light they rapidly grew larger.<br />
<br />
Stacy closed her eyes in ecstasy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, &quot; she said as she moaned.  &quot;You didn&#39;t say anything about how good it felt.  It&#39;s so sensitive.  It&#39;s like the whole thing is on fire.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She began to rub her shaft as it grew longer.  Sam saw with some disgust large veins bulging on the enormous monster, feeding its growth.  When it was about 12 inches long, Stacy shut off the light. Her balls hung out of the sling, as large as oranges.  A small amount of precum dripped from the tip of her erection.  Stacy was breathing in ragged gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah.  Now I&#39;m ready to play, &quot; said Stacy, as she advanced towards Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam backed away.  Stacy&#39;s new member was ridiculous, and he no longer had any desire for her.  The penis made Stacy look strange and unappealing, and he could not hide his disgust for her. Stacy recognized his repulsion, and put her hands on her hips.  Her cock wilted a  little.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?  Don&#39;t you like my cock?&quot; asked Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; said Sam quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with it?&quot; asked Stacy defensively.  It looked wonderful to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.  I don&#39;t like any cock.  I am really a guy, remember? &quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you change it in the first place?&quot; said Stacy angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Sam.  &quot;I was just messing around.  Maybe I was a little curious.  But this is just too weird.  I think I better go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam began to put his clothes back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.  Have it your way.  No one is keeping you here.  I know plenty of girls who would love to play with a cock like this, &quot; said Stacy. <br />
<br />
Stacy sat down at the bar, watching Sam dress.  His pants were now ridiculously large on his smaller feminine legs, and his shoes no longer fit.  He would have to walk barefoot.  He walked up to the bar with his shoes in his hands, looking sheepishly at Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what do you want?&quot; said Stacy angrily.  &quot;I thought you were leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam gulped.  He did feel bad about hurting her feelings, but he was just not interested anymore.  He just wanted to go home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. But I need my keychain flashlight back before I go,&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean this, &quot; said Stacy, holding the flashlight out of his reach.  &quot;Oh no, I am going to keep this.  My little punishment for what you did to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  But I can&#39;t stay like this!  I look like a freak! I&#39;m half female and half male, &quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
Stacy smiled.  &quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t worry about that.  I have a feeling the hormones from your new ovaries will eventually balance that out.  You may not be a looker, but after you finish developing I have a feeling no one will mistake you for anything but a girl ever again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I was only joking around.  I said I was sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sometimes being sorry is not enough.  Maybe this will teach you not to mess around with other people&#39;s lives.  Or maybe not.  Either way, I don&#39;t care.  Just get out,&quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
Sam did something that surprised them both.  He began to cry.  Maybe it was the hormones, maybe it was the stress, but whatever the cause he began to bawl like a child.<br />
<br />
Stacy sighed, and patted him on the back.  &quot;Okay, okay.  Stop crying.  I&#39;ll change you back, &quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? &quot; said Sam, still sniffling a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast, &quot; said Stacy.  &quot;You still  need to be punished first.  You still owe me a date.  Spend the night with me - just like we planned - and I promise I&#39;ll let you change yourself however you want tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam eyed Stacy&#39;s bulging member with apprehension.  It was no longer erect, but the small sling could not even contain its flaccid mass.<br />
<br />
Stacy rolled her eyes.  &quot;I&#39;ll keep my earlier promise, too.  We won&#39;t do anything you don&#39;t want to do. But you do have to stay with me the whole night.  We might go out, maybe hang with some of my friends.  I haven&#39;t decided yet. But you have to stay by my side for the whole night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was still nervous.  He wasn&#39;t quite sure that he trusted Stacy just yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, &quot; said Stacy.  &quot;The decision is yours.  I am not going to keep you against your will.  If you want to leave, go.  Don&#39;t let the door hit you on that sweet ass.  But if you want to use this flashlight again, you are going to have to earn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam felt his large plump ass.  Stacy was right.  His only hope of using that flashlight again was by giving into her demands.  But then again, he didn&#39;t like the way she was looking at him.  It was obvious that his body excited her. Who knew what she was really planning for him?  He only had her word that she would free him, and she was practically a stranger.  Maybe it would be better to just leave.  He could just go back to the magic shop and try to get help.  Maybe they even had another keychain he could buy. In the worst case he would just be stuck as some kind of tomboy.  <br />
<br />
Stacy stared at him, eagerly awaiting Sam&#39;s decision.</p>
