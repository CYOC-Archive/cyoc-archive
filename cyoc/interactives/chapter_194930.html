<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt nearly choked on his own fury as he heard Sandra&#39;s plain-spoken ultimatum. A threeway? With Neil Booth, of all people?!<br />
<br />
Eyes wide with disbelief, Matt looked at Sandra, then at Neil. Sandra was hot as usual: pretty of face with a toned body that was athletic without being either too bulky or too thin. Her breasts, as always, were perfect in Matt&#39;s eyes: round and full, without being unwieldy (not that he hadn&#39;t enjoyed a silicone-enhanced lovely or three when the team went out to a local strip club). Neil was another matter. The scrawny nerd that Matt loved to bully was gone, replaced by a surprisingly muscular specimen. Matt couldn&#39;t help but catalogue what he saw: pecs that stretched out the fabric of Neil&#39;s shirt, bulging arms that strained its sleeves, a tight waist that hinted at defined abs, and a set of powerful legs that filled Neil&#39;s gym shorts in a fetching way. Matt had to drag his eyes away from Neil and back to Sandra, embarrassed that he had been taking too much interest in another man. <br />
<br />
It was a dilemma. He desperately wanted to have sex with Sandra again. Normally he would never agree to share... But she had made her demand clear, damn her! <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Matt grumbled, &quot;I guess everybody needs to try a three-way at some point, right?&quot; The statement wasn&#39;t entirely true of course; Matt had enjoyed a few threesomes before, but always with two girls and never with Sandra. <br />
<br />
Sandra smirked. &quot;Glad to hear it, Matt. I&#39;ll text you after Neil and I go on our date, so that you can drop by and join the fun.&quot; She reached around and groped Neil&#39;s firm ass, grinning mischievously at Matt. Her ex stared for a long moment, then turned around and stiffly walked away, his back straight, head up. <br />
<br />
Sandra chuckled at Matt, then looked up at Neil. &quot;Dinner and a movie sounds perfect. I&#39;ll let you pick the food and the flick. Don&#39;t disappoint me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Neil&#39;s eyebrows rose. &quot;Well, what do you like? Or maybe more importantly, what don&#39;t you like?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sandra laughed. &quot;I hate most so-called &#39;chick flicks,&#39; so no rom-coms unless they&#39;re actually good, which they almost never are. I don&#39;t like garbage food, but I don&#39;t have the patience for anything pretentious either. Other than that, I&#39;m open to trying most things. Still, you should think about your picks. They&#39;ll say a lot about you.&quot; <br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />
Neil spent a good hour or so researching restaurants and current release films online, trying to find something that would hopefully impress Sandra without bankrupting him or turning her off. Unfortunately, he suspected that most of the things that fell within his budget would fall under Sandra&#39;s definition of &quot;garbage food.&quot; Finally he settled on a fairly new Japanese fusion place, a bit pricey in his mind, but hopefully good enough to impress his date. <br />
<br />
Films were difficult for other reasons. He was glad that he could disregard the usual crop of rom-coms, but that left him with poor choices all around. There was yet another superhero movie, the kind that required you to see fourteen others first if you wanted to actually understand what was going on. Neil had only seen six, and he had no idea what Sandra&#39;s tally was. Surely she would have mentioned something if she wanted the latest spandex blockbuster. Pass. Subtitled foreign drama. Pass. Artsy black and white film about nihilistic underachievers. Pass! He wanted Sandra to fall asleep in his arms after sex, not during the movie! <br />
<br />
Finally he found something that seemed interesting. A tale of modern sorcerers, living in the real world, trying to save it or something. It wasn&#39;t his normal fare--he was more of a classic fantasy guy, but something about it made him think Sandra would enjoy it. And if it had some scary bits, maybe she&#39;d hold onto him while they watched? He chuckled at that. She didn&#39;t seem the type who needed to hold on to a man&#39;s arm during a movie. But he enjoyed the fantasy of it happening. <br />
<br />
Having made his selections, Neil texted them to Sandra, who replied with a string of emojis. Some seemed positive, a few were inscrutable, but Neil hoped that the eggplant at the end was a good sign. He showered, enjoying the feel of his new muscles as he soaped them up, washing vigorously, hoping to be as clean as possible for his date. <br />
<br />
Afterwards he got dressed, which was more difficult than he expected. Most of his clothes were simply too small, particularly his dressier ones. Undergarments were the first problem; he burst through two undershirts before he decided to abandon the search entirely and stick to the right dress shirt. That wasn&#39;t easy either, as he found himself unable to get his arms in some of them, and buttoning them across his upper torso proved impossible, over and over again. Finally, he came across a dark, button-down shirt that was snug on his upper body but not uncomfortably tight. He rolled up the sleeves a few times, exposing half of his strong, veiny forearms. He couldn&#39;t get the top two buttons closed so he left them open, exposing the cleft between his upper pecs. Pants were a different problem, and there was no escaping the fact that they would be tight, particularly around his thighs and ass. Still, he managed to get them on, foregoing underwear to avoid the undergarment from showing under the taut fabric of the pants. He finished off his look by adjusting his hair until it was just right, the hairs mostly in place with a few stragglers for variety. Satisfied, he headed out, looking forward to his first date in what seemed like forever. <br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />
Dinner was surprisingly good. Sandra was quite knowledgeable about Japanese cuisine and used her chopsticks like a pro, while Neil awkwardly fumbled with his pair, dropping his food back onto his plate as often as not. The silver lining to his embarrassing lack of skill was Sandra&#39;s amusement at the situation. As she finished her own plate, she looked over at Neil and grinned. &quot;Those muscles of yours need to be fed,&quot; she purred, &quot;so open up, big guy.&quot; She picked up food with her own chopsticks and fed them to Neil. He laughed as well, then gladly accepted her help, letting her feed him the rest of his meal. <br />
<br />
As Neil had suspected, Sandra was not the type to grab onto a man for comfort and support just because there was an explosion on the screen or a tense moment accompanied by portentous violin music. What surprised him most was the places where Sandra laughed, often as one of the on-screen sorcerers explained some bit of magic. After a trio of very serious-faced sorcerers discussed some ritual to stop an interdimensional monster Sandra absolutely lost it, laughing loudly. Neil was confused by this--the scene didn&#39;t seem very funny at all--but he didn&#39;t mind, as she had a hand on one of his strong shoulders, needing to support herself on him so that she didn&#39;t fall out of her seat. Luckily the theater was all but empty, so her laughter did not disturb anyone nearby. Neil put his arm around her, holding her close as she cracked up. <br />
<br />
As they left the theater, Sandra was ebullient. Still laughing over &quot;the most ridiculous dialogue I&#39;ve ever heard&quot; and &quot;a plot so contrived it&#39;s like they were trying to make it bad!&quot; She snuggled up close to Neil, their arms around one another as they walked. &quot;That was a lovely evening, Neil,&quot; Sandra gushed, &quot;Tasty food, good company--even if you needed some help feeding yourself, and a movie that made me laugh harder than I have in months!&quot; She stood up on her toes and planted a peck on Neil&#39;s lips. &quot;Who knew you had such a good nose for comedy?&quot; <br />
<br />
Neil grinned back. He didn&#39;t think the movie had been meant as a comedy, but right then he didn&#39;t care. He returned her kiss, drawing the moment out longer than she had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go back to your place,&quot; she breathed, as their lips finally separated, &quot;I&#39;ll let Matt know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do we really need him?&quot; Neil asked. Right then, he only wanted Sandra. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. We don&#39;t need him at all,&quot; Sandra answered breezily, &quot;But I want him there. I want him to see that I&#39;ve moved on to a better man than him. And I won&#39;t lie, I&#39;m being petty. When we dated he just thought of me as a trophy--a pretty girl to show off to his friends. At the same time, he was fucking half a dozen cheerleaders behind my back. And probably others. So this is about his comeuppance. You understand, don&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Neil thought back to all of his experiences with Matt in the past. Until the last few days, they had been universally negative. He smiled down at Sandra. &quot;Then let&#39;s go back to my room and let the bastard know where to find us,&quot; he replied. The smile she returned was both heartwarming and frightening.  <br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />
Matt arrived at Neil&#39;s dorm room twenty minutes late, thinking that tardiness would show Sandra that he didn&#39;t actually need her, he just chose to participate in her little threesome. Besides, Neil Booth couldn&#39;t possibly be much of a man in bed, right? Even under those new muscles, Matt was sure the little nerd was still there, deep inside. Maybe Sandra knew it too. Maybe that was why she wanted him along. To take over when Neil failed to perform. <br />
<br />
The thought brightened Matt&#39;s mood. He opened the door without knocking, striding confidently into the room, ready to rescue Sandra from ho-hum amateur lovemaking. <br />
<br />
Yet the door had not even closed behind him when Matt saw the two of them naked on the bed, clearly in the throes of passion. Sandra was moaning softly, a sound that Matt recognized from back when they had dated. He was unable to see her, however; Neil&#39;s broad back and powerful body obscured everything but her hands and feet from Matt&#39;s view. He watched, mesmerized as Neil&#39;s ass undulated,  his glutes activating over and over, driving his cock forward into Sandra. She let out a cry of ecstasy, her hands suddenly clawing at Neil&#39;s muscular back, adding new red marks to the ones that were already there. A moment later Neil was grunting loudly, his body tensing up, his well-defined muscles on stark display as he came. <br />
<br />
Matt stood, dumbfounded, as Neil and Sandra remained in position, their bodies tense, panting heavily from exertion. Slowly, Neil withdrew from Matt&#39;s ex, then rolled over to the side. Finally, Matt could see Sandra directly. She looked better than ever, her toned body glistening with perspiration, her ripe breasts full, her nipples erect. Then he looked over at Neil. The nerd&#39;s body was more spectacular than Matt had guessed. While a lot of people look better clothed, Neil was the opposite--undressed, he embodied the sculpted perfection of a Greek god, only on a larger, more muscular scale. A flutter of arousal hit Matt as he saw Neil&#39;s genitals: a surprisingly hefty, fully erect cock rising above a pair of big, round balls. <br />
<br />
Matt tore his gaze away, looking back at Sandra. He tried to put on his cockiest, most confident grin. &quot;I see you let Neil warm you up. You ready for a real man, now?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sandra&#39;s laugh was not what Matt expected. &quot;Oh Matt,&quot; she panted through giggles, &quot;After the pounding Neil just gave me, my pussy needs a break!&quot; She reached down and rubbed herself gently, still smiling. &quot;But it looks like he&#39;s still ready to go. I&#39;m sure you can show Neil a good time too, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Matt looked over at Neil. The muscular nerd spread his powerful legs, showing off his erection and the stuffed sack below it. Matt licked his lips nervously. His feet carried him to the bed. He did not bother undressing; that could come later. He joined the two of them, lying down between Neil&#39;s legs. Matt propped himself up on his elbows and then began to experimentally lick Neil&#39;s big shaft. It tasted like Sandra and Neil at the same time, his semen mixed with her juices. Matt was strangely aroused by it, especially the parts that tasted like Neil. That surprised him, but he was unable to draw himself away. He ran his tongue over Neil&#39;s sack, savoring the taste of the other man&#39;s sweat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Suck him off, Matt,&quot; Sandra demanded, &quot;You always liked oral. Time to learn how to give, not just receive!&quot; Matt complied. There was something about Neil that he found bizarrely hard to resist. He opened wide, taking in half the shaft. &quot;That big dick has been fucking me all night,&quot; Sandra continued, &quot;And it&#39;s been absolutely amazing!&quot; Matt&#39;s cheeks flushed crimson with embarrassment, but he kept sucking, trying to get more of Neil&#39;s manhood down his throat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help you,&quot; Neil rumbled. He reached down with one strong arm and grabbed the back of Matt&#39;s head, pushing him further down on that big shaft. Matt choked as he felt Neil&#39;s tool hit the back of his throat and then go down further. &quot;Sandra told me you like this move a lot,&quot; Neil added, a smirk on his face. He pushed Matt&#39;s head down until the jock&#39;s chin touched Neil&#39;s nuts. Matt&#39;s eyes watered and he looked upward. Neil&#39;s whole body seemed to pulse and throb in time with the cock that was rammed down Matt&#39;s throat. Matt knew it must be his imagination, but it seemed like the nerd&#39;s dick was getting bigger, forcing its way deeper down his throat! The balls against his chin swelled as well, pressing against him more and more. Matt looked up again. Neil&#39;s head was thrown back, a low grown of pleasure emerging from his thick neck. His whole body looked bigger, stronger, more muscled. Matt&#39;s eyes widened. It was unmistakable. Neil was growing! <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s going to keep getting bigger and bigger,&quot; Sandra whispered in Matt&#39;s ear as Neil&#39;s body added temporary size. &quot;Bigger and better. Bigger than you. BETTER than you. Look at him! This is how he will look in a week or so. Isn&#39;t he magnificent?&quot; Matt had to agree that Neil looked amazing. The nerd&#39;s muscles were beyond impressive, as big as Bradley the trainer&#39;s, big and hard and full of raw strength. Matt could feel Neil&#39;s huge legs close around him, getting thicker and stronger, squeezing his body between them. &quot;He&#39;s already better than you ever were,&quot; Sandra continued, venom in her soft voice, &quot;and he&#39;s going to continue improving, as you can see!&quot; <br />
<br />
Matt tried to look at Sandra as she pulled away, not understanding anything that was going on. She snuggled up against Neil, her hand running along his mighty chest, caressing the huge slabs of muscle that resided there. Matt could only hold on for dear life as he felt the big man begin to buck under him, thrusting his strong hips upward while holding Matt&#39;s head in place, slowly fucking the jock&#39;s throat with his increasingly-oversized nerdcock. Matt wanted to escape, and at the same time, he wanted nothing more than to be right where he was, sucking on that truly magnificent piece of meat. <br />
<br />
Neil looked down at Matt. Who would have ever thought that Matthew Brooks would ever be where he was, sucking on Neil Booth&#39;s cock? He groaned softly as he felt Sandra&#39;s hand run over his big pecs. He used his free arm to pull her in closer while the other kept Matt&#39;s head in place so Neil could fuck it. His cock was throbbing eagerly now, so close. &quot;I- I&#39;m gonna cum...&quot; Neil growled, surprised by how deep his voice was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot down his throat,&quot; Sandra demanded, &quot;Make him drink it!&quot; She expertly twisted one of Neil&#39;s nipples, a little pain heightening the pleasure he felt. <br />
<br />
Neil put both big hands on the back of Matt&#39;s head as he came, his whole body tensing up as he shot his load down the jock&#39;s abused throat. Sandra grinned wickedly, raining kisses along one of Neil&#39;s powerful arms, the muscles taut as the big man held Matt&#39;s head in place until every drop of nerd cum was deposited into the jock&#39;s gut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for joining us, Matt,&quot; Sandra said dismissively as Neil finally finished and released the other man. Matt took a deep breath as he detached from Neil&#39;s huge rod, then looked up at both of them in confusion. &quot;He&#39;s mine for the rest of the night. You can go now,&quot; Sandra explained. She made a shooing motion with her hand. &quot;Close the door behind you, will you?&quot; She turned away from Matt and toward Neil, kissing the huge man and running her hands over his powerful body. <br />
<br />
Matt stood and pondered the scene in confusion. Then he trudged away, his mouth still tasting like Neil&#39;s huge cock, the tang of the big man&#39;s semen on his tongue. Matt&#39;s pants were full of his own seed; he had lost control when Neil started fucking his mouth, cumming in his underwear. Head dropping in defeat, he exited as instructed, closing the door behind him just as he heard Sandra let out a shriek of pleasure.</p>
