<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Agatha arrives home she is greeted by her mother, “hey, darling,” the woman, who’s name is “Jane”, says with a smile, “did you have fun at the beach?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, mom,” Agatha says, smiling back, “yeah, I found a small cave and had a little swim.”<br />
<br />
“Happy to hear that you had fun,” Jane says, she then notices the necklace, “Agatha? Where did you get that necklace?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I bought it at a stand by the beach,” the girl lies, “don’t worry mom, it’s fake gold, I paid 5 Dollars for it.”<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “it really looks like real gold,” she says, “sorry for sounding shocked for a minute. It’s a beautiful necklace.”<br />
<br />
Agatha nods, “yeah, that is why I bought it,” she says, “plus, the pentagram reminds me of a “witches star” and you know how much I love stories and myths surrounding “witches”.”<br />
<br />
Jane nods and chuckles, “you sure do,” she says, “I remember, when you were younger, that you regularly said you’d love to be a witch with unlimited and strong magical powers.”<br />
<br />
Agatha grins, “hehe, I kinda still would love to be a witch,” she says, “having magic powers would be amazing!”<br />
<br />
Jane chuckles, “you will always be my little “witch”, dear,” she says, “with or without magic powers,” she adds jokingly. “By the way,” the woman continues, “our neighbors, the “Johnsons”, asked if you could babysit their twins.”<br />
<br />
Agatha groans, “mom, they are such annoying 8-year-old brats,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jane snorts, “you weren’t any better in at that age,” she says, “boys be boys, the Johnsons offered to pay you 50 Dollars for the evening.”<br />
<br />
“Hm… well, I guess I could do it,” Agatha says.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “great, I’ll let the family know,” she says, “they want you to be at their house at around 6pm.”<br />
<br />
Agatha checks her watch, “I better get myself ready then,” she says and hurries to her room.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Agatha finds herself walking up to the Johnson’s house, ‘I hope the boys won’t give me a hard time,’ she thinks to herself, she then knocks on the door.<br />
<br />
When the door opens, she is greeted by the smiling face of one of the twins, “hey Agatha,” the young boy says, “me and my bro were excited to hear that you were the one to watch after us, while mommy and daddy are out.”<br />
<br />
The boy has short black hair, brown eyes and an athletic body, he is wearing a blue t-shirt and a blue jeans shorts, he also has a nice brown skin tone.<br />
<br />
“Hey… um… Jordan,” Agatha asks, unsure which of the twins the boy is, since the two look the same: same hair color, same eye color, same stature, same everything.<br />
<br />
The boy giggles, “hehe… nah… it’s James,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Agatha says, “s-sorry,” she adds, feeling embarassed.<br />
<br />
The small boy gives the girl a hug, “don’t be,” he says, smiling, “and no need to feel embaressed, no one is able to tell us apart.”<br />
<br />
Agatha smiles and returns the hug, “well, I’ll get it right sooner or later,” she says.<br />
<br />
James, still smiling, lets go of Agatha, “come in,” he says, “Jordan, mommy, and daddy are in the living room.”<br />
<br />
Agatha follows James into the living room where the girl is greeted by Jordan and the boys parents. “We are thankful, that you agreed to watch our boys, while we are out,” the mother says, smiling, “the boys promised to behave themselves and not cause any trouble, right boys?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, mom,” the two boys say.<br />
<br />
“To be honest,” Jordan says, looking at his brother, “we know that we are two mischievous boys, and that we kinda… well… annoy Agatha most of the time.”<br />
<br />
“Hu? This is not like you,” the dad says.<br />
<br />
“Well,” James says, rubbing the back of his head, “we… we realized, after the last time when Agatha watched us, she seemed to be upset, even though she tried to play it off.”<br />
<br />
The parents turn to the girl, “what have the boys done,” the mother asks.<br />
<br />
“Um…,” Agatha hesitates, even though the “brats” always play mean pranks on her, she did not want them to get punished.<br />
<br />
The boys notice Agatha’s hesitation, “just tell them what we did,” James says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jordan says, “we accept any punishment our parents come up with.”<br />
<br />
“Damn,” the father says, “that does sound as if you two have done something bad.”<br />
<br />
“Please, Agatha,” the mother says, “just tell us.”<br />
<br />
“B-but, what about your night out,” the girl asks.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it, the night is young,” the parents say, “this has priority.”<br />
<br />
Agatha lets out a sigh, “fine,” she says, “the boys pulled a mean prank on me. They filled a bucket with stink bombs and placed it above the bathroom door, leaving a gap so it wouldn’t fall. Well, I needed to use the bathroom and…,” the girl trails off.<br />
<br />
The parent’s eyes widen, “JAMES, JORDAN,” the mother shouts, “how could you?! You know darn well how difficult it is to get the stink away and out of clothes.”<br />
<br />
The boys hang their heads, “we know,” they say, “we… we just wanted to have some fun… and… and we over done it.”<br />
<br />
Jordan looks up at Agatha, “what really shocked us,” he says, “instead of telling on us, you said, when asked why you… um… “smell”, that you didn’t have a shower that day.”<br />
<br />
James nods, “we… we also noticed that, after the “event”, you… you give us a look of… disappointment and… hate.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Agatha says, “what you have done has really hurt me. Can you blame me for… well, hating you?”<br />
<br />
The boys lower their heads, “no,” they say.<br />
<br />
“We… we were so surprised that you decided to watch over us,” James says, “we… we kinda guess you are doing it just to get the cash, but in reality, you don’t want to be here.”<br />
<br />
Agatha is taken aback, “man, you are scary smart,” she says, “but… yeah… that is the reason I have agreed to this.” Agatha looks up at the parents, “s-sorry… I guess I better go,” she says, “you should find someone else.” The girl slowly starts to walk out of the living room, when she suddenly feels a small hand on her wrist, holding her back.<br />
<br />
When Agatha turns, she sees the sad face of James, “please Agatha,” he says, “don’t go. At least hear us out first.”<br />
<br />
Agatha looks over at the parents, “give the boys a chance,” the mother says, “we are, to be honest, pretty surprised by this behaviour.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Agatha says, “I’ll listen to what you have to say.”<br />
<br />
James lets go of Agatha, “we… we wanted to say that we are sorry,” he says, “and we made a decision.”<br />
<br />
Agatha tilts her head, “really,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Jordan nods, “yeah,” he says, “after we realized how much we hurt you with our “prank”. We decided to never EVER again do something like that!”<br />
<br />
“We decided to change,” James continues, “we decided to not be naughty and mischievous any more.”<br />
<br />
The boys look over at their parents, “didn’t you guys notice anything different about us?”<br />
<br />
The parents look at each other, then they nod, “we actually did,” the mother says, “we noticed that you two started doing your chores without whining and helping around the house.”<br />
<br />
“We just assumed that you were trying to archive something,” the father says, “like a reward.”<br />
<br />
The boys shake their head, “no, we are not awaiting a reward,” James says.<br />
<br />
“We… we just want Agatha to like us again,” Jordan says.<br />
<br />
Agatha looks at the boys, who are looking up at her, tears in their eyes, “w-we really are sorry,” they say, “we hope you can forgive us and give us a second chance, and a chance to prove that we have changed.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Agatha says, “I don’t know what to say. But… I forgive you, let’s start a new chapter together.”<br />
<br />
The boys smile, then they rush over to the girl and hug her, “thank you, Agatha,” they say, “we promise, we won’t let you and our parents down.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” the parents say, “what happened to our little devils?”<br />
<br />
The boys turn around and grin, “the “devils” have become “angles”,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Nah, seriously,” Jordan says, “we really changed, no more naughty stuff from us!”<br />
<br />
The mother smiles, “keep it up, and you will archive great things in life,” she says.<br />
<br />
“What, no punishment,” the boys asks.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” the parents say, “we are to proud of you.”<br />
<br />
The boys run over to their parents, “we promise we’ll keep it up,” they say.<br />
<br />
The parents smile, “good, now let us go,” they say, “we have got to go.”<br />
<br />
Agatha and the boys follow the parents to the door, “have fun at the movies,” they say.<br />
<br />
“We will,” the parents say, “and you three have fun yourselves.”<br />
<br />
“We will,” Agatha says, “see you in a few hours.”<br />
<br />
The parents get into the car and Agatha and the boys wave until the car is out of view, Agatha then turns to the boys, “okay, what would you two like to do?”<br />
<br />
“How about we play Mario Cart on our Nintendo,” James suggests.<br />
<br />
Agatha grins, “are you sure,” she asks, “I’ll not hold back.”<br />
<br />
The boys grin, “the challenge is on,” they say, then they rush into the living to set everything up.<br />
<br />
Agatha follows the boys, smiling, ‘I think this night will be something to remember,’ she thinks to herself. As she follows the two boys, Agatha suddenly feels weird, as her body starts to tingle all over, at the same time she feels a weird energy growing inside of her. As quickly as it came, the feeling subsides, “that was strange,” the girl mumbles, “I feel as if I am charged with some kind of energy.” She turns her head, her gaze landing on a broom, without thinking the girl points a finger at it and says, “sweep,” her eyes widen in shock as the broom suddenly starts to move on it’s own, starting to sweep the floor. “What the hell,” Agatha exclaims, “stop,” she commands and the broom clatters to the floor. Agatha gasps, ‘not possible,’ she thinks to herself, she looks around and sees a flower in a pot. The girl concentrates on the flower, suddenly the flower changes color, from yellow to blue. When Agatha concentrates on the pot, the pot starts to levitate, Agatha grins, ‘no freaking way,’ she thinks to herself, she then looks down at the necklace, she notices a weird glowing coming from it, ‘did I really find a magic necklace which gives me magic powers? It has to be! This is amazing, I feel so powerful!’<br />
<br />
“AGATHA,” she hears the boys call, “WE ARE READY!”<br />
<br />
Agatha grins, ‘oh, this evening will be more interesting than I thought,’ she thinks to herself, before calling, “BE RIGHT THERE, BOYS.” The girl starts to walk towards the living room, ‘I wonder what the boys will say,’ she thinks to herself, ‘when I tell them I am a witch!’</p>
