<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Alright, Birthday-Boy!” Jake chuckled. “It’s your day! What do you want to do, first?”<br />
<br />
“Go to the mall!” Ty replied excitedly. “I can’t wait to go to the mall! In fact… I wish we were standing inside of the mall right now!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ty and Jake vanished from the edge of the soccer field, and they re-appeared inside the large shopping mall, just as Ty had wished! Ty had teleported both boys to the mall in an instant!<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! How… How did we get here so fast?” Jake gasped.<br />
<br />
Ty was startled at first. For a brief moment he had forgotten about his power, when he realized that he had wished them to the mall. He was planning on telling Jake about his powers eventually, but not yet, not now. So he made a silent wish for Jake to think that they rode the bus to the mall just now. Jake blinked for a moment, before he turned to face Ty.<br />
<br />
“Umm… Luckily I had a few dollars for the bus fare, huh? Now, do we have anough money to buy you some clothes?” Jake asked him.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… yeah, sure we do!” Ty replied. Ty silently wished for Jake to have two-hundred dollars in his pocket, which he had gotten from his rich uncle. “Look in your pocket!”<br />
<br />
Jake placed his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wallet, containing exactly ten twenty-Dollar bills.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, I forgot! Here, Ty! Here is one-hundred Dollars!” Jake said, as he handed half of the money to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Jake! Dude, thank you so much!” Ty said, as he took the money. Ty knew that Jake always shared everything with him, ever since they were in the first grade.<br />
<br />
The two boys then wandered around the mall, where they walked past a large sporting goods store. Jake wanted to go in there right away. In fact, he was totally fascinated by the weight-lifting equipment.<br />
<br />
“I thought soccer was your favorite sport?” Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
“It is, but to be honest, I wish I had some more muscle on me!” Jake sighed. “It would be nice if I were a little bigger, too…”<br />
Deep down, Ty didn’t want to be taller than Jake. Jake had always been bigger and taller than Ty, and Ty would rather keep it that way. Jake was always a bit protective of Ty at school, and he had stood up for Ty on numerous occasions. Ty wasn’t very comfortable with the idea of suddenly being the biggest, so he decided to give Jake his growth spurts that he had wished for. That way, he would ensure that Jake would always remain much bigger, taller and more muscular than Ty. Furthermore, Dustin had always been rather scared of Jake, and he never tried anything when Jake was around.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Jake! I think you’ll have your growth spurt pretty soon!” Ty smiled. “You’re set to get really big any day now!”<br />
<br />
“Oh how do you know that, Ty?” Jake chuckled. “You may end up passing me in height!”<br />
<br />
Ty realized that Jake needed a boost in confidence real quick. He had to give him that growth spurt like… Now!<br />
<br />
While Jake walked around the treadmills and weight benches, Ty decided to make Jake hulk out right then and there.<br />
<br />
“Time for Jake Jasper to grow!” Ty whispered. “I wish Jake gained a hundred pounds of muscle and grew to seven feet tall right… NOW!”<br />
<br />
As Jake was walking over to the weight bench, he was suddenly overcome by a powerful tingling sensation in his body, which began in his legs and traveled it's way up to his torso and then up his chest to his arms. Every muscle in his body tensed up, forcing Jake to pause for a moment, making him freeze in his tracks. <br />
 <br />
 &quot;Oh man... I feel like I'm... overcome by a cramp or something... Oh my God...&quot; Jake groaned as he could hardly move thanks to the intense tingling and the amazing stiffness in his muscles.<br />
 <br />
 Then, like magic, his body began to grow bigger in every direction! He started to expand on all sides, as his shoulders widened, his legs grew longer and thicker, and his hands and feet grew bigger all at the same time. Luckily, Ty also made it where his clothes grew along with the rest of his body, so that he wouldn't burst out of his shirt or his soccer shorts. His socks and cleats would expand at the same rate as his body as well.<br />
 <br />
 Jake torso expanded as well, growing longer, bigger and wider at the same time. He grew taller in the process, as his entire body just became more massive. Jake grew into a much large size as he grew from 5 foot 7 to 6 feet in a matter of seconds, and then continuing upwards by another twelve inches until he reached the amazing height of seven feet! He truly started to look more like a basketball player than a soccer star!<br />
 <br />
 Once Jake reached the height that Ty had wished for, his muscles now started to inflate, adding another one-hundred pounds, fulfilling the second part of Ty's wish. Jake's biceps began to fill out and cover the upper part of Jake's longer, bigger arms, while his calves grew rounder and thicker on his massive legs. Mighty abdominals covered his huge torso and large, round, solid pectorals which were the size of medicine balls filled out the top part of his large chest. Truly, everything about Jake was now BIG! He was now a big boy with big muscles!<br />
 <br />
 When Jake had gained about one-hundred pounds more in muscle, the growth spurt stopped, leaving Jake gasping as he looked down and surveyed his massive body with huge muscles while he now looked down on everybody from the staggering height of seven feet! Clearly, he was standing taller than everybody in the store!<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Oh wow... Oh my gosh... What happened to me?&quot; Jake wondered, as he looked around.<br />
 <br />
 Ty quickly wished for Jake, and everyone else, to find it normal that Jake was a seven-foot muscle boy.<br />
 <br />
 Jake blinked for a moment before turning to find Ty.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Hey, Ty! Did you see these treadmills?&quot; Jake chuckled. <br />
 <br />
 &quot;Yeah! Just be careful! You're too big to walk on those!&quot; Ty laughed.<br />
 <br />
 Indeed, with his super-long-stride, Jake's long legs covered the entire length of the treadmill.<br />
 <br />
 Jake hopped off the treadmill and walked over to the weight bench before Ty shouted something at him.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Jake! Let's go to the shoe department! We both need new shoes! Come over here!&quot; Ty ordered.<br />
 <br />
 Jake immediately got away from the weight bench and followed Ty to the shoe department. Ty thought it was hilarious that this huge, hulking muscle kid was following him around. But, Jake was always like that. Ty was his best friend, and he always wanted to be with Ty no matter what. Plus nobody messed with Ty when Jake was around him, and Ty liked it that way.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;Let's check out the shoes. Afterwards, we'll go to the video game store. We'll pick up the game and then go to my house. Dustin and my parents should be home by then!&quot; Ty laughed.<br />
 <br />
 Ty couldn't wait to see the look on Dustin's face when he saw how big Jake had become!</p>
