<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So this is the college?&quot; John asked as Harry drove by the college campus for the second time in the day. <br />
<br />
Janice was quiet for the moment, as this wasn&#39;t her favorite part of the tour the first time around, however she was interested in seeing on how John&#39;s tour had gone. From what she&#39;d heard things had gone well for him, and that was what had lead him to stumbling onto Huck and Betty at City Hall. That interest let her keep her cool as Harry dove by the college again to show John. John was actually quite pleased with it. Some of the major buildings had an older look to them, sort of like City Hall did while there were a few buildings that were in the distance along some of the smaller roads on the campus that looked a bit more modern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry said with a smile as he drove along and then motioned to some of the buildings as they drove around, &quot;We can&#39;t stay for long, as I&#39;m sure Ginger&#39;s parents will want her home soon, but we&#39;re going past the dorms where Jenny was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were here before,&quot; Janice said slowly, &quot;when &quot;daddy&quot; decided Jenny wasn&#39;t sad enough...&quot;<br />
<br />
The note of sarcasm was easily noticeable, but Harry and Jenny nodded as they thought back to their wedding. Thankfully all that nonsense was long past and John actually asked a question that got things off that subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I have to go there?&quot; John wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be free to do what you wish,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;if you wish to go to college outside of Moon Lake, Harry and I will file out the loan paperwork and find a way to get you to your college and back safely. If you wish to go here to Moon Lake College, we&#39;d do the same. Or if you wish to not get a college degree and go straight into the workforce that&#39;s up to you, too. Though I wouldn&#39;t make that decision today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I have to stay in the dorms if I did come?&quot; John clarified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;some Moon Lake residents do stay in the dorms while in college, but most of those that stay in the dorms are from out of town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; John asked to Ginger as he turned over to face her, which caught the young red haired teen by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t even got that far in advance,&quot; Ginger said with a small start as she didn&#39;t expect the question, &quot;I&#39;ll look more into colleges when I get to my Senior year... maybe when I know more on what I want to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; John commented as Harry moved along and soon came up the college&#39;s northeastern corner near where the administration building was.<br />
<br />
Harry then turned to the left and began to head back toward the center of town. As he got up to the outer cub of the circular roads at the center of Moon Lake he looked to the rearview mirror to note Ginger and John&#39;s position in the back seat. The two sat quietly for the most part, though she did point out some things she thought were interesting and thankfully, John didn&#39;t complain about things like the library the way Janice had. Of course, meeting Moses at the lake had probably made Janice&#39;s day, even if Moses wasn&#39;t a weremer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you need to be dropped off at home, Ginger?&quot; Harry asked to her as the turn for his family&#39;s home wasn&#39;t that far away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can walk home okay,&quot; Ginger answered, &quot;but thank you for the offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry nodded and turned and soon turned onto the driveway for his parent&#39;s home. Things seemed relatively quiet, just as they were earlier in the day, but that wasn&#39;t too bad and Harry was pleased that ultimately Janice and John had a good time getting to see Moon Lake. He couldn&#39;t be sure as to whether or not John or Janice would actually become weres, but the big thing was to at least help them get to know Moon Lake, a place that Harry had come to love. Ginger being there as a friend for John made things even better. As he and Jenny got out, Harry couldn&#39;t help but notice John offering his hand to help Ginger out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a good time today,&quot; John said to Ginger as she got out of the backseat of the car and brushed herself off, &quot;thank you for showing me around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem,&quot; Ginger told him, &quot;hopefully you liked it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think I&#39;d always like being able to walk and talk with friends,&quot; John said slowly and then looked down for a moment before finishing, &quot;or with a really good friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully your brother will be able to get things like your books turned in quickly,&quot; Jenny commented from the front of the car, &quot;you&#39;ll make more friends... and perhaps find all the answers that you feel you need, knowing that they will be by your side.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded as he and Ginger shared a brief hug before soon heading off toward the O&#39;Toole home down the street. She waived back over her shoulder for a ways, and John simply focused on it for a little while before Janice came around the back of the car and approached him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you had a good time, John,&quot; Janice said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Janice,&quot; John answered her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you think of the lake?&quot; Janice asked him as they began to head in through the garage with Harry and Jenny leading the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looked cold,&quot; John commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be pretty cool this time of year,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;but Moon Lake won&#39;t really get cold until the end of November at the earliest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need jackets... I don&#39;t think we even had them in Alabama,&quot; Janice commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may end up being tomorrow&#39;s mission to Target,&quot; Harry looked over to Jenny for a short bit, &quot;they may not be much... but while we can be fairly warm thanks to the Pacific&#39;s coastal effects, the fact that we are in the mountains can mean that we&#39;ll see more freezing temperatures than Alabama does when winter hits in force. But for the moment... let&#39;s go in, and let my folks know that Huck and Betty are now man and wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they seemed happy when Ginger and I ran into them,&quot; John added, which Harry smiled and nodded to.</p>
