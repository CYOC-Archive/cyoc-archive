<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It would be nearly two weeks before Bradley returned to the stables to be &quot;with&quot; the horses. In the mean time he had other things to deal with. Besides helping the farmhands and dealing with his regular chores, Bradley found his mind preoccupied with the question of why he hadn't been crushed and why it was he could no longer keep down anything that was normal for a human.<br />
<br />
He knew that his problem had started shortly after the incident with Buck and Autumn and that when he finally regained his senses, he had already gorged himself with about sixteen pounds of feed, mostly in grasses. And to top it all off, to wash it all down, he'd drunk nearly eight gallons on warm water.<br />
<br />
Disturbed by these facts, he'd wandered for a bit before finally winding back in the main stable, were he collected his clothes and slowly redressed himself. Heading back to the house, Bradley made his way up to his room and lying down on his bed, he stared up at the ceiling. As he did this, he puzzled over what had happened in the barn and after a bit, he began to drowse. Falling into a fitful sleep, he passed the night dreaming something about horses.<br />
<br />
When he awoke in the morning and stumbled downstairs to get himself breakfast, it was only to find that most of what he found either tasted weird, off or that he couldn't keep it down. Thinking about the previous night, he decided to try something and before he knew it, Bradley found himself out in what of the least used pastures, grazing on the sweet grass that grew there.<br />
<br />
And if that wasn't bad enough, Bradley found that a diet of hay, grains, grasses and warm water was the only thing his stomach would accept. All with this came that the fact that usually within one day he usually ate and drank about as much as any Mare that was on the ranch.<br />
<br />
Bothered by this, Bradley found himself staying away from the barns as much as possible and only going in when he needed to feed, which he did away from the prying eyes of the farmhands.<br />
<br />
But his strange eating habit wasn't the only problem he had discovered. Curious about something, noticing that no matter how much he took in that he was still as lean as ever, Bradley decided to weigh himself. Stripping down to nothing, he stepped on the scale and just before it broke, he noticed that it topped out at nearly nine hundred pounds.<br />
<br />
Upset about this, he stared into the mirror at his reflection. After a moment, deciding that as soon as the farm hands were gone for the day he would use the scale for the horses, Bradley slowly began to get dressed. As he did this, he wondered how it was that he could still be rail thin, nearly six foot three and weigh so much. Unable to come up with an answer, he figured it must have something to do with his strange diet combined with the fact that he was constantly active.<br />
<br />
When the farmhands finally left for the day, Bradley was only to glad and heading out to the barn, forgetting to wait to make sure none the help didn't return, Bradley headed for his office. Inside, he stripped off his clothes and standing nude, he closed his eyes and breathed deeply the scents of the stable, remembering why it was that he loved being out with the horses.<br />
<br />
After a couple seconds he exited the office and strolling through the barn, he stared at the horses, his mind straying away from why he'd come into the stable in the first place. When he spied the scale, Bradley suddenly remembered. But than he saw the stepladder next to the scale and suddenly his thoughts were drifting to Autumn. Thinking, &quot;Maybe, when I'm done,&quot; he strolled over to the scale and began setting it up, curious about what it would read when he stepped onto it.<br />
<br />
When he had the device ready, Bradley suddenly found himself leery about stepping on the machine and it took him another couple minutes to convince himself to step onto the scale. When he did, he glanced over at the digital readout and nearly screamed in alarm as it stopped at a weight of about one thousand two hundred and forty three.<br />
<br />
Unable to believe that he actually weighed that much, Bradley stepped off the machine and than back on. When it once again read the same weight, he stepped off, checked the machine to make sure it was calibrated right and stepping back on he once again read the weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I weigh 1,243 pounds,&quot; Bradley thought as he sat down, his mind reeling that he weighed about as much as a horse. But than he once again spied the stepladder.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;I need something to take my mind off my problems,&quot; Bradley stood and fetching the ladder, he headed over to were Autumn was penned. When he passed Buck, he set the stepladder down for a moment and approached the horse, telling the animal, &quot;I don't want a repeat of last time,&quot; as he checked and made sure the animal was secure.<br />
<br />
When he'd done that, he turned his attention back to Autumn and after positioning the step-ladder behind her, he climbed up and after moving her tail, he began to rub against her genitals, liking how it felt as she became moist and he started to get hard. And just as he was about thrust his hard penis into Autumn's vagina, something behind him gave a snort, followed by a grunt, to which Bradley had just enough time to think, &quot;Not again,&quot; before something thrust its way up onto him and pinned him in place.<br />
<br />
As he was caught between Autumn and the other horse, Bradley heard the stepladder fall just as something hard pressed into the area between his legs. A squeal of pleasure escaped Bradley before he had time to think about it and than what he knew to be a horse penis was thrusting away at the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, Bradley thought it wasn't just pressing against the flesh between his legs, but was actually thrusting into his body, to which he wondered if somehow he'd been hurt. But all that was driven from his mind as he felt a pinching sensation in his feet and wanting the horse to get off him, Bradley tried to call out commands to back the horse off, but found all that escaped his lips were squeals of pleasure, with a nickering noise and a couple grunts coming every once and a bit.<br />
<br />
When the horse atop him finally blew its load and Bradley could feel the wet, sticky cum coating his own genitals, upper legs, and area between his legs, the horse slowly backed off. For a couple minutes, Bradley just lay atop Autumn, unable to process what had just happened. After a moment, he slid sideways and with a weird clicking noise, he landed feet first on the concrete. Looking around at the various stalls, noting that all appeared to be secured, Bradley wondered which horse it was that had violated him a second time.<br />
<br />
Walking a couple shaky steps forward, he paused when he once again heard the strange clicking noise. Wondering what it was, he glanced down.<br />
<br />
This time a scream did escape him and as he sat down, he glanced in horror at what had once been his feet. Running a hand over his ankles, Bradley shivered as he touch the fine, white horse hair that covered them, but drew his had away, unwilling to touch the hooves that now were his feet. Noticing that they were unshod, like all of the horses on the ranch, Bradley wondered what was happening to him and glancing down at his genitals and the spunk that was dripping off them, he pondered over whether having a horse have its way with you had anything to do with it.</p>
