<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben was a reasonably popular guy at the local college. Tall, blond haired, brown eyed, lean, rather good looking though nothing really stunning, he had a number of good friends and close associates, and often got invites to some of the parties thrown by the frats. Nobody really had anything bad to say about him, even the dysfunctional &quot;local sociopath&quot; Gary. As he sat in class, listening to Professor Ian Hartwell drone on about economics however, his thoughts weren&#39;t on the theories posited by the teacher, but instead, by the unknowable seeming presence of Katie McIntyre. <br />
<br />
She was the woman of his dreams. Involved in the campus&#39; newly formed archery club, and involved in student leadership in general, Katie McIntyre was a tall, athletic, capable young woman with short cut light brown hair, bright blue eyes, a lightly tanned look, and in every respect a capable young woman. Schoolwork, leadership and athletics... she was amazing, she had it all...and yet, despite his attempts at overtures - though never disrespectful - Ben was consistently ignored by her.<br />
<br />
Always politely, of course. Ben wasn&#39;t blind - he could tell when he wasn&#39;t wanted. She was okay with them being friends, but it was clear she either waited for the right moment for love, or she just didn&#39;t have time for it between all her obligations. It wasn&#39;t like she wanted one of the more athletic guys, either. The jocks at the school had no better luck than he did. He remembered his best buddy Cal Caswell joking about how she was an &quot;ice queen&quot;, and he had immediately shut Cal down about that.<br />
<br />
She deserved respect, and he intended to find some way to finally have her notice him the way he noticed her. <br />
<br />
It was the cold sweat that broke out on him then that made him stand up and ask to go to the bathroom. The teacher, shrugging his broad shoulders, said, &quot;Alright, Ben Lambert... logging you out for now. Be back soon.&quot; He didn&#39;t look long enough to see the teacher logging his departure. A hand cleared some sweat from his brow. Thankfully Hartwell wasn&#39;t being his usual hard-ass self. The 42 year old teacher was a former athlete whose plans had gone awry somewhere along the lines, and fell back on economics.<br />
<br />
Honestly, sometimes Ben felt like Hartwell intimidated some of the other students due to how much he reminded them of a Billy Zabka style &quot;mean guy&quot;, albeit grown up. <br />
<br />
By the time Ben stumbled into the nearest bathroom to reckon with whatever was causing his malaise in the middle of class, splashing water on to his face to try and cool down, Ben looked into the mirror. One splash, he was alone. The second splash, a young man with just about shoulder length black hair and icy blue eyes stood there, dressed in a white button up shirt and business style pants, dusting off his sleeves. Ben just about jumped when he suddenly saw the guy there - even moreso because he just couldn&#39;t place the man&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
He looked like he could be anywhere from 18 or 19 to his 20s or 30s, depending on how one took visual cues. <br />
<br />
He was tall, lean and built like a runner. Ben guessed he qualified as handsome, though in more of a &quot;scene kid&quot; kind of way. &quot;Howdy.&quot; The single word introduction made Ben look him over, and then realize he could only see the man in the mirror. There was nobody else in the bathroom with him in the real, physical bathroom - but he could see this man in the mirror---<br />
<br />
&quot;So I heard you made a wish...&quot; The man spoke, and somehow Ben could hear him as if he was in the room with him, standing where he was positioned in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Are you...&quot; Ben started to put two and two together about this guy, wondering if this was some sort of dark encounter, or a figment of his mind calling up some corner of a religious upbringing he barely had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Satan? Hardly!&quot; The man guffawed and put a hand on his knee, &quot;Hardly. I&#39;m a...<i>choice giver</i>. I give people the choice to make a change. To actually have their wishes fulfilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So more like a genie.&quot; Ben responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Kind of?&quot; The man cupped his chin and stated, &quot;You only get one wish from me, and it&#39;s the one you already voiced. The desire for one Katie McIntyre to notice you. I can guarantee you that notice, and give you the traits and capacities - over the course of a week - to maintain her romantic interest. No catch. No got yer soul nonsense. Just commit to the bit, and you&#39;ll have your girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Swear. Swear on your power---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone watched a certain pirate movie lately,&quot; The man in the mirror chuckled, &quot;Alright, alright. Your caution is noted. I swear on my power I won&#39;t do anything but grant you your wish. Capisci?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben - being an overeager and romantic minded young man - nodded along eagerly, thinking he had more or less guaranteed that his benefactor was not going to have any avenue to screw him over with this. And then he heard the snap of the fingers, reverberating through the entire bathroom, and something hit Ben all at once. A heat, an arousal, concentrating throughout his body. He&#39;d never exactly been the most overtly sexual of his peers. He preferred taking girls out on a few dates before getting to the sexy time stuff.<br />
<br />
But right now Ben was just too turned on to function properly. He glanced once at the mirror, and saw he was alone again. Not even thinking about what he saw in the glimpse, he sank to his knees and pulled out his hot, erect and pulsing cock. Ben was not exactly a small guy in the sack, but he wasn&#39;t a goliath either. He was reasonably happy with his six and a half incher, and it had given a number of young women very pleasant nights in his company.<br />
<br />
Ben was dimly aware of the slapping of hair in his face as he frantically rubbed off, his face showing a hot red blush as he found himself registering a greater sensitivity and pleasure in his manhood than ever before. But even as he jerked off, he felt a sting in his stomach, then an outright burning sensation - like he&#39;d just felt the result of a long, intensive workout hit him all at once. But he couldn&#39;t very well stop himself from masturbating...<br />
<br />
One hand gingerly raised his shirt, and the changing young man&#39;s eyes widened. He saw six pack abs he had never exactly had before. The burning feeling spread out and intersected with the arousal, leaving Ben awkwardly grunting and quivering - the sensation was so hot and sweet, and yet it hurt so much. His shoulders seemed more toned, his arms looked more tight and muscular... He could even feel his legs growing stronger, visibly so, right through the material of his pants.<br />
<br />
His thighs had certainly never looked like that before. Briefly, Ben could feel something concentrating in his chest, and he let out a sharp gasp as his nipples grew slightly larger. He figured it must be pectoral development. Apparently Katie liked guys with pecs or something, though not bulky like the jocks here... his thoughts didn&#39;t remain there for long, and he threw his head back as he registered the pleasant sensations coming before---!!<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m---I----I&#39;m ooooh! I&#39;m gonna cum! I&#39;m gonna cum!!&quot; Ben couldn&#39;t stop himself from blurting out, no longer even caring if someone outside the bathroom&#39;s locked door heard him. The orgasm was just too good to not vocalize. And it was so much <i>more</i> than usual! Somehow, he was feeling this particular cum more than he had ever felt any orgasm in his life...! <br />
<br />
Ben painted the floor at his feet, quivering as the last few spurts of sperm finished. His shirt stained by sweat, he stood back up and fixed up his pants, looking in the mirror to see... he looked different. Decidedly different. Enough to be legitimately worried. Ben now had a more androgynous facial appearance, longer hair and thicker lips along with fairer features - some of his hair tended to hang down in a bang by his left eye. Yet there was a sort of toughness to him now alongside it in a weird way.<br />
<br />
His muscles looked more defined, yet not much bigger. But he felt stronger all the same. It was certainly a different sort of good looking, and he realized this must be Katie&#39;s type of man. &quot;Well, I asked for that weirdo to change me into the kind of guy that Katie found hot, can&#39;t really complain about the result. And that WAS one hell of an orgasm. Fuck! It felt so good...haah, I gotta get back to class. Fuck, probably in so much trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ben left though, he raised an eyebrow when - as he came back into the class - the teacher turned his head and said, &quot;Ah, back so soon? Well, points for expediency.&quot; Ben swore that he&#39;d spent at least a good while in that bathroom... but hey, he wasn&#39;t going to look a gift horse in the mouth. <br />
<br />
As he sat back down he found himself thinking on Hartwell&#39;s story. Must suck, to be an athlete on top of the world, probably fucking like a porn star, and then get knocked down by some random bullshit that like, broke his knee or something. Well, at least he seemed to bounce back well enough. If Ben was being honest, Ian Hartwell was probably the most ripped teacher here. Guy was probably at least an amateur bodybuilder. And sure he had that &quot;80s movie villain all grown up&quot; vibe, but he wasn&#39;t that bad---<br />
<br />
Ben shook his head, and then happened to look at Katie.<br />
<br />
And unlike any time before, he found her looking at him more. A smile on her lips, and she actually waved at him somewhat flirtatiously. Could this have actually worked? Was he actually seeing this? Katie seemed like she actually noticed him - actually treated him like he was an option! A lazy smile crossed his face as he returned the wave, the two students focusing on the professor&#39;s lecture for now, but a single gesture informed him she wanted to talk after class.<br />
<br />
And indeed, class couldn&#39;t have flown by fast enough.<br />
<br />
Once the class ended and Hartwell started taking questions, Katie approached him and said, &quot;You&#39;ve been looking really good lately. Honestly, I&#39;m a little jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have nothing to be jealous of on my end,&quot; Ben stated confidently, &quot;You&#39;re effortlessly amazing every single day. And here I am just going through the motions---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, I&#39;m not effortless.&quot; Katie giggled and then said, &quot;I&#39;ve got some time open tomorrow, if you&#39;d like to go to the campus cafe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Could this actually be a date!? &quot;Yes! Yes...uh, yes.&quot; Ben nodded excitedly, and Katie stood up;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you then~!&quot; And with that she headed out, and left Ben sitting there, excited and eagerly anticipating the first bit of real romantic interaction he&#39;d ever really had. He didn&#39;t know what that guy in the mirror did, but it was pretty clear it worked. Ben had no other classes today so he felt free to head out and head home to prepare for the date. Maybe he&#39;d get in a session at the 20 Fitness nearby to make sure that he was in the best shape possible for the next day. He certainly didn&#39;t want to disappoint her!<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Outside the classroom, Katie walked with one of her friends to another of her classes. The life of an honors student rarely had room for dalliances like romantic hook-ups, especially one who was so involved in student leadership. Let alone someone with her preferences. As she walked, her best friend Rhonda from class walked up beside her and said, &quot;Wow, I just could not believe - you and---I mean. I swear I thought you were---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please, Rhonda.&quot; Katie pushed some hair out of her eye, and smiled, &quot;I&#39;m not that far on the lesbian end of the Kinsey Scale, Rhonda. I mean, Bryn is---&quot; Katie paused after saying the name, as if there was something both usual and unusual about it, &quot;Bryn is genderqueer. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah, yeah, sorry.&quot; Rhonda shook her head, &quot;They / Them, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I was there for Bryn&#39;s coming out---I think? I think.&quot; Katie found herself questioning a moment. For some reason she remembered two histories briefly. Ben - and Bryn. And it was getting so difficult to remember---she swore, she was gonna need some rest tonight. Maybe she was just overworking herself.<br />
<br />
She had a date tomorrow - and honestly, she figured she might need the time to relax and enjoy an outing. Yet even as she walked off, it seemed like something was just---weird today.</p>
