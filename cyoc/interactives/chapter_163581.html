<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken, a bold as new young stallion and with the dark of night he too felt the need to sleep. When he awoke in the morning the first thing he noted was that half of his body was quite wet from the morning dew. The second thing new felt was the soft muzzle of a jennet donkey sniffing his sheath. He laid there and let the jennet do her sniffing and an occasional snort what felt equally nice, as it began to arouse his cock to showing the limp, but blunt end to protrude from his sheath about four inches.<br />
<br />
The jennet became as well aroused and bit more aggressive when she saw some of his cock. Ken just laid where he was, his head up and his body rolled to where his sheath was just visible. The jennet leaned closer, and her muzzle pressed at his exposed cock tip, she then began her mothering instincts, licking at the crusty dried vaginal juices what Ken had to feel as sticky.<br />
<br />
Ken felt a great sense of calm as he lay there and letting the jennet donkey do for him what he could not do, or reach his own tongue. Her licking began more of his cock to become aroused from out his sheath. Ken noted then of two more jennet donkey coming to watch or take turns being nice to a stud.<br />
<br />
After the two inquisitive jennets came to be near Ken, the whole herd awoke and their morning bodily duties began with dozens lifting their tail and let go gushing streams, making large puddles to feminine scents. There were other Jennet who felt the urge to void their bowels and they built small piles of what <br />
Ken smelled and he being more human than equine at least mentally, he thought the poop stunk.<br />
<br />
His playful jennet worked on with her slathering cleaning of his cock until she smelled more that required her licking but had not b then come out of the sheath, she became as incensed, and nip-bit at the skin of his sheath; that nip aroused Ken to get up off the ground and stand, being capable to defend his body from harm or injuries.<br />
<br />
As soon as Ken stood up he began to look around, as he could have sworn of hearing someone calling his name. Looking around he turned his head to the right as then to the left and back to the right as turned is whole horse body, but all he saw were donkeys.<br />
<br />
The wet lick of an overly friendly jennet donkey liking the scent and as much the flavor of his Highland pony cock did something for Ken, as so much he thought to try the Game again but make his stay as a permanent thrill. As a few jennets wanted to remain near the stud, many others wandered away. Ken looked at those wandering, as going further into the pasture as he recognized a few as donkeys he bred with the previous day.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…,” thought Ken, “Must have really satisfied their needy selves, but what of my new followers gamboling about me?”<br />
<br />
Ken was willing to let his friendly jennet donkeys to frolic all around him, as each acted as calmly willing for their herd-mates to offer affectionate licks up or down the length of his erect cock. As he liked the sensual attention given him, he would whinny softly. It was when he whinnied he heard the sound of voices, or the occasional shriek, like of a woman when surprised.<br />
<br />
The day began when midmorning and after two hours of solemn grazing by all, that a blonde jennet stepped in front of Ken and he taking note of her, did give her rump a sniff.<br />
<br />
Ken shook his head and felt a shiver rattle along his spine to cause his tail to whip harshly from side to side. He liked what his equine sensory told him was a ripe female. Then to reassure his inkling, Ken reached his muzzle close and gave the jennet vulva a broad-tongued lick. Her vaginal flavor worked to send his stallion mindset into full arousing state of breeding desire. His cock was out and fast bloating to full length, and he felt the weight of it hanging from his sheath and groin.<br />
<br />
The jennet smell his state of arousal happening and she stood stiffly, her hind legs spread. Ken stepped close and began a quick courting, sniffing, as double check to make sure the jennet was ready and willing. Ken had from the previous day discovered from two jennets who offered him their bodies; when Ken came close enough to mount, the jennet then tried to kick at him to go away.<br />
<br />
The Blonde jennet was a large as older female and had gone through the mating sessions with other studs, some as virile Jackasses, and stallions; maybe preferring the stallion for not acting brutal or crude.<br />
<br />
An easy afore-leg leap and Ken stood mounted. He wished for a short minute he had with him Jeff as his penis, that Jeff could help aim the erect cock and make breeding quite easier. As practice tend to help make any move as better, Ken felt the broad blunt tip of his cock penetrate between the winking vulva lips. He shivered when his bloated cock slid along the rippling vaginal walls. The jennet brayed softly from the eased in feel of the cock as if she knew the difference between a thrill and an intruding male impaling her with his cock.<br />
<br />
When feeling as fully planted inside the jennet, Ken began to thrust slowly, wanting to enjoy the wealth of sensations he derived from mating with an experienced jennet. “Seven…, eight thrusts and…,  and oh my, oh, oh, as oh wow ,five times, five, that is a record for my new style of ejaculating!” Ken thought as with that he eased his cock back with a plan to drop out and back to his standing on all fours.<br />
<br />
That was not her plan, she the jennet, as Ken had enticed her to feeling a sense of joy, and any jennet will want for some joy to continue. The jennet stepped one hind leg forward and held inside her the cock, as Ken felt flustered though thrilled. He pushed his erect cock in deep and the two remained as joined for most of an hour, as during that time he again heard voices.<br />
<br />
“Yes, oh yes, I love,” Ken thought of right about then he heard laughter, and with turning to look, he dislodged his cock from the wonderful jennet. As someone amid the laughter made mention of morning wood!<br />
<br />
Ken returned to grazing but through his day he bred with four other jennets and still, he heard voices.<br />
<br />
The sight of a darkening sky told of another night and after much grazing and breeding, Ken learned the art required from lifting his tail; and lengthening his stance to relieve his bladder. Sleep finally took control the Ken slept through his second night to waking on the third day of an expected five day equine adventure as wet from the morning dew. <br />
<br />
His third day met the rolling sound of thunder and a torrential rainstorm what worked to give the herd a needed washing. As waves of storms blew past and engulfed the herd, Ken tried to lure the jennets to lying in the grassy pasture rather than to congregate around tall trees. A few followed Ken to the open pasture, and from being their gained a better wash of their furry bodies. The lightning was fierce with one storm, but the herd lived to graze on wet grass. Ken did not mate between the storms and the sensed fear quelled any horny jennet to staying cool.<br />
<br />
Day four began with Ken rising and he like the herd of jennets did his first of the new day bodily duties before meandering into the pasture to mindlessly graze.<br />
<br />
As the morning of day five began and Ken barely could recall that his fifth day being a Highland pony stallion meant of something to happen, he ignored the worry for breeding with six jennets during a busy morning.</p>
