<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy finally succeeded in controlling her emotions, but as she lay in bed, seething with anger, she began hearing the faint sounds of Mary and Mark in the room next door. Through the wall came their muffled voices first talking and laughing together, then whispering quietly. Her little head spun with visions of the two of them - doing what?? All Cindy could see when she closed her eyes was that last image of the two young adults embracing outside the bedroom door. She hated to think that they might still be together - kissing each other, or even....!<br />
<br />
Little Cindy climbed down from her bunk, quietly opening the door, and tiptoeing down the hallway as she cautiously approached Mary&#39;s room. Inside, a light was on and she could see the two sitting together on Mary&#39;s bed, touching each other, in a warm, intimate embrace. For a second she stood, at first a little frightened to interrupt the two big adults, but her anger at Mary quickly gave her courage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pssst!! Sis!! Hey Sis! C-can I talk to you for a minute?&quot; called Cindy in her little child&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary! What are you doing out of bed?! Didn&#39;t I just tell you to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no! Cindy!! I NEED to talk to you NOW!!&quot; hissed Cindy. &quot;Out HERE, in the HALLWAY!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary smiled at Mark, kissing him on the lips as she got up from the bed. &quot;Sorry, this&#39;ll just take a second. You know how little children can be!&quot; Mary was really getting into her new role as a young adult - she relished the feelings of freedom and power of being the baby sitter for a change! Cindy was right - Mary was a little drunk, and the alcohol had given her a bit too much self confidence. She was definitely enjoying her power trip: it amused her to watch as the three little children - little Cindy among them - had to jump to obey her orders! And now, with Cindy shrunk to an immature little child, it was hard for Mary to resist getting back at her for all those times she teased her and bossed her around when she was a little girl!<br />
<br />
Mary could see that Cindy was upset, and had already guessed that Cindy wasn&#39;t happy seeing her with Mark - but she had no idea that Cindy had a crush on him. Mary figured her big sister was just jealous and embarrassed to see Mary getting a boyfriend while she was stuck with the little children. But big sister or no, there was no way she&#39;d give up on her big chance for a new boyfriend! All her life she had always been this little skinny kid that boys ignored, and now finally Mark - a big college boy! - was interested in her! She had already decided that she HAD to have him - whether her shrunken older sister liked it or not! <br />
<br />
Mary came out to the hallway, hands on her sexy hips and an angry, impatient look on her adult face as she glared down at her petite little older sister. &quot;Now what on earth do you want??! This&#39;d better be good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy was momentarily shocked at how big Mary now seemed - standing in her bare feet, and with Mary in her big high heels, Cindy&#39;s little head now barely came above her tummy! She was more than a little scared and intimidated by her large sexy sister, but bravely continued in her high child&#39;s voice, &quot;Mary! I can&#39;t believe how queer you&#39;re acting!! Just what do you think you&#39;re doing?? How dare you treat me like a little child??&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary feigned innocence. &quot;Hey look, Cindy! It was all YOUR idea to pretend to be a little girl! I&#39;m just doing what you asked me to!! Hey, you should THANK me for helping you to fool everyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but you let Mark see me all naked!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary started giggling, &quot;Hey, Sis, I hate to break the news. Face it - there&#39;s nothing there to see!&quot; She reached down and tapped Cindy teasingly on her little chest, giving Cindy a view of her deep cleavage as she leaned over. &quot;After all, it&#39;s not like you have boobies or anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary!! That&#39;s not funny!!! You take that back right now!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary giggled at the sight of her little whining sister. &quot;Oh, all right Cindy. Now if I tell you I&#39;m sorry will you promise to leave us alone and go straight to bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!!! I&#39;m not finished yet! And another thing - you stay away from Mark! He&#39;s MY boyfriend and NOT yours! You hear me Mary?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary cocked an eyebrow in amusement at her shrunken sister&#39;s little tantrum. She couldn&#39;t believe that Cindy was still trying to order her around. Her boyfriend, indeed! What would Cindy think of next? &quot;Oh, so now Mark is your BOYFRIEND? (giggle) That&#39;s news to me, Cindy - and I&#39;ll bet its news to HIM, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just you shut up, Mary! He ALWAYS liked me - and the only reason he&#39;s with you now is &#39;cause he thinks you&#39;re me!! He and I go back a long time! We used to baby-sit together and stuff. He even kissed me one night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, did he now?&quot; teased Mary merrily. &quot;You two actually KISSED each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you make fun of me!!!&quot; squealed Cindy. &quot;He really kissed me - right here in this house! An&#39; then he wrote me letters and everything!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sultry teen grinned down at the frantic little child. &quot;Well, I hate to pop your little balloon Cindy, but Mark told me all about you two! Remember, he thinks I&#39;m you! So I found out all about it when we were doing some &#39;reminiscing&#39; tonight after dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? W-what did he s-say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, (giggle) he says he always thought of you as this skinny little kid that just used to follow him around - sort of a little pest. He told me he felt sorry for you, so one time he gave you a kiss to make you feel better. But he really regretted it &#39;cause ever since then you&#39;ve been sending him these stupid letters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You stop it, Mary! T-that&#39;s not true... He kissed me for real! He likes ME!!! Not YOU!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about that... (giggle) Now tonight, we&#39;ve been kissing about, oh, maybe 20 times, and he keeps telling me how much better he likes me now - how much prettier and more mature I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That does it Mary! I&#39;ve had enough out of you!! It was a stupid idea for us to pretend to be each other! I&#39;m stopping this whole thing RIGHT NOW!! I&#39;m gonna go in there and tell Mark what the REAL story is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Little Cindy stormed past Mary and into Mary&#39;s bedroom. Mark was still sitting patiently on the bed, and looked up in surprise as the angry child approached. Poor Cindy saw that even sitting down he was still several inches taller than her! Her body was tingling with anger, and she noticed her jammies felt a little looser - she hoped her emotional confrontation with Mary hadn&#39;t started the shrinking process again! Taking a deep breath, she shouted out at the big young adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark! Look! It&#39;s me, Cindy! I know I don&#39;t look like me now, but I&#39;ve gotten smaller &#39;cause of a youth formula the doctor gave me! And Mary is big now &#39;cause she&#39;s taking these growth hormones! And, anyway, I&#39;m gonna get big myself in about a week! But the point is, I&#39;m Cindy and she&#39;s really just Mary! You see, Mary and I were just pretending to be each other! But I&#39;m NOT Mary - I&#39;m really Cindy! And you weren&#39;t with me - you were with Mary!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark shook his head in confusion, laughing at the little outburst. He smiled down paternally at the small child. &quot;N-now what was that again, Mary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-NO! I&#39;m Cindy! Cindy!! I&#39;m NOT Mary!!&quot; cried Cindy, her little child&#39;s body hopping up and down in frustration.<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s sultry form appeared at the doorway, her arms crossed over her ample breasts, an amused look in her eyes, &quot;Now sweetie, don&#39;t you bother Uncle Mark! It&#39;s way past your bedtime and I think you&#39;ve just been having some funny dreams.&quot; Mary smiled at Mark and continued in a conspiratorial tone, &quot;The poor little dear... she&#39;s created this whole little fantasy world of her own! The doctor says it&#39;s a psychological reaction to her lack of development, &#39;cause she&#39;s so little. She takes it so seriously - sometimes I think she actually does believe she&#39;s me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!! Mary!! STOP IT!!&quot; Little Cindy rushed up to Mark, jumping on his lap, an imploring look on her wide eyed little child&#39;s face &quot;Y-you believe me, don&#39;t you Mark? You KNOW it&#39;s really me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark smiled as he tried to comfort the frightened, desperate child, &quot;Of course I do, honey! We all believe you! Now why don&#39;t you let Uncle Mark carry you back to bed and we&#39;ll talk all about this in the morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-NO!! I&#39;m NOT a little girl! I&#39;m an adult! Y-You d-don&#39;t understand!!&quot; Looking around frantically at the two mature adults, Cindy suddenly realized the hopelessness of the situation, and abruptly burst into tears and rushed from the room! The two young adults watched in wonder as the little child ran crying down the hallway and back to her bed room, slamming the door shut behind her!<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what was THAT all about?&quot; laughed Mark, a shell shocked look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know - children are always full of surprises!&quot; laughed Mary. Pulling the strap of her dress off her shoulder to accentuate her cleavage, she grinned as she sauntered sexily across the room and sat next to Mark, slowly wrapping her arms around his broad shoulders and sighing breathlessly as she leaned in for a kiss. &quot;Now then...&quot; she giggled, &quot;...where were we...?&quot;</p>
