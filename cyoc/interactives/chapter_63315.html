<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that spearhead that Ty the Tyrant had driven into the <br />
dragons heart happened to have a few molecules of metal<br />
that had once graced a dragons hoard millenia ago.That meeting <br />
of the cursed dragons hoard with a the flesh of a transformed <br />
human set off a reaction.<br />
<br />
         Now some time later the student who had been that impaled <br />
dragon went in to the blood donor clinic,and his tainted blood ended<br />
up inside some egghead lab technician named Abner  who<br />
spent most of his time analyzing the electron orbits of hydrogen atoms.<br />
<br />
         Not surprisingly Abner spent his off hours fantazizing about comic<br />
books and derring do and had joined a local club of superhero fans.In<br />
that club were also the two students who didn't remember being transformed <br />
into fighting dragons,and Raymond,who happened to work at the universities<br />
X Ray and Holographic Images department.<br />
<br />
          One day Abner came into the X Ray room to have a shot done of his<br />
sprained wrist,which he'd injured picking up a beaker of hydrogen atoms.<br />
He wanted to make sure no bones were broken.<br />
<br />
         Raymond put his friends injured hand under the scanner and looked <br />
over at the view screen,expecting to see the ghostly image of the bones of<br />
a human hand.There was nothing there,nothing,just blackness of the <br />
negative image.<br />
<br />
          Raymond asked his friend to move his hand and the plate and was startled<br />
to see the images of much thicker larger bones flying across the screen.He kept<br />
quiet and asked Abner to move his hand more slowly,much more slowly on the <br />
plate.<br />
<br />
       It quickly dawned on Raymond that the X Ray scanner was recording something <br />
not visible to his own eyes,the rather large primieval joints of a reptilian wrist.He kept <br />
quiet and simply kept clicking the record button as he adjusted the micrometer screw on the <br />
scanner.It seemed that he was peering at the boney forepaw of a reptillian giant lizard<br />
that dwelled in another plane of existence.<br />
<br />
        Raymond asked Abner if he had any pressing engagements for the next hour or so <br />
and was glad he didn't.He helped him on the bed of the X Ray machine and lying like the <br />
dickens,gave the unseen reptillian giant lizard a partial full skeleton scan.<br />
<br />
        After he'd thanked Abner and hurried him out the door the excited Raymond took the <br />
memory tapes of his work down to the universities Hologram room and loaded up the <br />
image of the giant lizard he'd just recorded on the X Ray machine.<br />
<br />
            He just stood there for several hours staring at the holographic<br />
skeleton of the 12 foot tall winged lizard and the image of a human skeleton<br />
he'd projected beside it for comparison.<br />
<br />
            The giant lizard was amazing enough,but Raymond noted Abners scaly <br />
alter ego was clutching one forepaw with another,whilst at the time Abner had <br />
lain on the bed for the full body X Ray,Abner hadn't had a similar pose.It seemed that <br />
what Abner had done was affecting his alter ego,but the opposite didn't apply.<br />
<br />
        For the next while Raymond heartily encouraged his friend Abner to make <br />
frequent visits to the X Ray machine,and when rumours reached the Superhero <br />
Club that dragons had been seen charging about the university hallways months <br />
earlier,Raymond quietly investigated and made the connection between the <br />
blood transfusion,his friends weird inner self,the two students ,the two dragons <br />
and what the X Ray machine was revealing.He got X Rays of the two 'dragon students'<br />
and wasn't too surprised to discover that their inner boney beasties were much bigger<br />
and much more reptillian than Abners alter ego was.<br />
<br />
            One fine night Raymond sat alone in the X Ray lab,the small remaining vial of <br />
tainted donors blood in front of him,and decided to take the plunge.He injected the tainted<br />
blood into his bloodstream and then recorded the transformation of his X Ray image<br />
from a 6 foot tall human skeleton to a hunched over winged lizard thing with a 6 foot tail<br />
and a lengthening neck and deforming human skull.<br />
<br />
            Then realizing what he'd just done to himself,Raymond helped himself <br />
to some preserving alcohol and got royally drunk as he continued recording the <br />
X Ray images of his human skeletons deformation into a wobbly 4 footed winged <br />
dragon skeleton,under the X Ray scanner anyways.<br />
<br />
          Raymond laid off the research for 2 weeks after that,but continued<br />
visiting the Superhero Club,where Abner and the other two tainted dragon<br />
people began talking about dinosaurs and komodo dragons as potential <br />
superheroes.Raymond kept quiet,but mused on the notion their inner monsters<br />
could probaly give Magneto ,Juggernaut and Dr Doom some whatfor if they were<br />
ever released.He had a idea of how that could be done.<br />
<br />
         On the day the two dragons had appeared month's earlier,there'd<br />
been a extra heavy burst of X Rays in the area thanks due to a overload<br />
in the universities Holographic X Ray projector.<br />
<br />
         So it was that Raymond booked a appointment to use the universitys<br />
H X R building,and he paid the security guard handsomely to go<br />
away for a few hours.<br />
<br />
           He suited himself in a reproductive shielding apron,made his <br />
speeches to the camera recording the historic occassion and set the <br />
X Ray Projector at maximum dose,on all frequencies of the X Ray <br />
sprectrum.<br />
<br />
         The female voice on the computer counted down and then<br />
zapped Raymond with X rays.<br />
<br />
           First he felt nothing,then his pelvis began to ache ,his nipples<br />
and chest began to itch and his clothing felt tighter.<br />
<br />
             Then came the intense pain as his growing body suddenly accomaded<br />
a widening pelvis and his breasts began to swell.<br />
<br />
         Before Raymond could react,he felt a force reshape his thoughts <br />
and she felt her growing womanly body burst out of her reproductive<br />
shielding suit,and her hair lengthened and her groans of pain got louder <br />
in volume and rose several octaves as Raymond realized she wasn't <br />
changing according to plan.<br />
<br />
        Obviously her inner dragon was female,she hadn't counted on that.<br />
Realizing things might get worse,the giant nude woman slammed a fist <br />
onto the power panel and ended her continuing growth and changes.<br />
<br />
        Raymond got on her hands and knees,and just barely slipped under the <br />
four storey tall entrance doors to the building.Outside she got up and the <br />
99 foot tall woman planned her next move.She strolled off into the night,still <br />
reeking of radiation.<br />
<br />
         Hours later the Superhero Club ended its nightly meeting.Vice Dean <br />
Richard Johnson had decided to entertain the members with his tales of <br />
derring do in the Korean War.He was a little tipsy and by coincidence he,Abner <br />
and the two dragon students who'd started the whole shebang ended up in the <br />
same car,and headed off back to the city.<br />
<br />
       The meeting had gone on longer than expected,and so they all <br />
agreed to take the old shortcut across the long abondoned bridge,to<br />
save some time.<br />
<br />
         Now as you can imagine the giantess Raymond had got <br />
himself turned into was distraught,and had broken into the alcohol <br />
fermentation vats and got herself plastered.<br />
<br />
        So it was that one giant mutated human female and 3 members <br />
of the Superhero Club and their VIP guest were plastered and <br />
doomed.<br />
<br />
          Which brings us to the being inside Raymond,that female dragon <br />
living in the X ray plane who'd been overdosed with X rays and had managed<br />
to stay in her own plane of reality,the Bone Dragoness Lady Druckulina,<br />
Royal Daughter of the Bone Dragon Queen and the critter those X ray images<br />
had shown residing in Raymond.<br />
<br />
             Raymond the Giantess was lying face down below the abandoned bridge <br />
when her form suddenly stretched,thinned and lengthened.Her face pushed out <br />
into a reptillian snout,her arms sank into her body,her chest heaved and pulled <br />
apart to reveal her lengtheneing scaled snake torso,her hair fell into the creek and it was a <br />
hissing 200 foot serpent that arose from the creek bed and noticed the humans car just <br />
halfway across the swaying collapsing abondoned bridge.<br />
<br />
         Druckulina just sat there,swaying her serpentine neck,but some part<br />
of Raymond's intelligence imparted the knowledge to the unconcerned LadyDruckulina <br />
that the car aught not to drop the minor distance of 80 feet to the creekbed below.<br />
<br />
           So the serpent lashed forward,snatching the tiny metal toy in her snakey fanged <br />
jaws and tossed the car full of screaming humans into the nearby bushes<br />
rather rudely.<br />
<br />
            Then the giant Lady Druckulina slithered off into the night.<br />
<br />
           A hour or so later<br />
<br />
          Raymond awoke on the floor of the X Ray Projector building,just in time <br />
to see and feel his snouty fanged snake face push back into his human skull.<br />
<br />
         He quickly felt over his body and the breasts,the wide hips and the lack of a <br />
certain reproductive set of items down below told him he'd be a man in a womans <br />
body for a while longer.Thankfully the strange feminine beastly thoughts lay <br />
dormant,and he quickly covered up the new additions before the security guard came in.<br />
<br />
           He needn't have worried.The talk of the town was of sightings of<br />
a giant nude Marilyn Monroe and a giant snake here ,there and everywhere.</p>
