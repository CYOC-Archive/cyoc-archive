<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So Paul still wearing the floral dress went inside with Naomi and Kimberly. She had to pretend it was her first visit to the stadium. Naomi showed her where the ladies toilet was &#39;If you need help just ask me&#39;. While Mandy warmed up with Paul&#39;s team he found himself in the kiosk. Naomi purchased herself a coffee and hot chocolates for Madeline and Kimberly. <br />
<br />
While they drank Naomi asked Madeline about where she came from what siblings she had and what grade she was in at school. Paul answered as best he could making up a tale that fitted with the story Mandy had made up in the car. His Mum was Sonya, she was Paul&#39;s deceased dad&#39;s Sister. Madeline was in grade 3 at Abbington Primary school, Abbington being a medium sized town about 100 miles away. Paul was relieved when the game was ready to start and they moved back into seats near the court to watch the game. The questions finally stopped.<br />
<br />
Paul was in dread of his mother making a fool of him on the court. If she played like a pansy he would never live it down. He wasn&#39;t a star player but he was a regular starter for the team playing as the second guard. He didn&#39;t want to lose his spot in the stating line-up.<br />
<br />
He need not have worried. His Mum seemed to know what she was doing. The pretend Paul didn&#39;t fumble the ball and indeed opened the scoring for his side with a jump shot that only touched the net. Shortly after Mandy got a steal and did a lay-up. &#39;Way to go Paul&#39; yelled out Naomi. By half time Paul&#39;s team was leading by 5 and Mandy had scored 7 points. That was only one short of Paul&#39;s best ever effort - for a whole game.<br />
<br />
At half time he went with Naomi and Kimberly onto the court to listen to Mr Scott&#39;s pep talk. &#39;Your playing great Paul. Keep it up. It looks like you have finally got the idea of defensive pressure. Like I&#39;ve told you. Work on your defence and offensive opportunities will open up&#39;<br />
<br />
Paul took that as somewhat of a personal criticism. He gladly went with Kimberly when she produced a basketball and said &#39;&#39;Hey Madeline do you want to try and shoot some goals&#39;<br />
<br />
While the pep talk continued the two smaller girls went on the court. The 10 foot ring seemed a mile away to Paul&#39;s new perception. Kimberly took the first shot. It lipped the ring but didn&#39;t fall in. Paul got the rebounding ball on the second bounce. She lined up and shot but was dismayed to see the ball fall 2 feet short of the ring - she didn&#39;t have the strength. Kimberly retrieved the ball and her next shot went in off the backboard. <br />
<br />
Paul had two more shots but he couldn&#39;t get the ball up to ring height. Kimberly took charge &#39;When I was little I used to shoot like this. You should try&#39; she then demonstrated an underhand shot before passing the ball to Paul. Still playing the role of a pip-squeak girl she mimicked Kimberly&#39;s shooting action. She was able able to get the ball up there but his accuracy was way off. <br />
<br />
&#39;Get off the court you two&#39; yelled Dave as he came thundering in and seemed to jump over Paul before failing on an attempted dunk. Paul tried to scurry away but ran into Simon the teams centre. With transfer of momentum Paul felt like he was flung through the air before ending up sprawled on the court.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry I didn&#39;t see you down there. Are you alright?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll help her. She&#39;s my cousin&#39; said a concerned Mandy. Mandy whispered to her &#39;Try not to show your knickers to everyone&#39; Paul quickly pulled the dress down to cover the white little girl panties she was wearing. Her dress had ridden up when she fell. Mandy helped her to her feet and walked her back to Naomi. <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll take her Paul. You get back to your warm-up&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you sore anywhere?&#39; Naomi enquired<br />
<br />
&#39;Just my pride&#39; Paul replied.<br />
<br />
Madeline sat with Naomi and Kimberly for the second half. Kimberly wasn&#39;t terribly interested in the basketball and was asking Madeline whether she had read any of the &#39;Baby sitters Club&#39; books. <br />
<br />
&#39;No I haven&#39;t&#39; Madeline was getting tired of watching Mandy star out on the court. She had lost track of how many points Mandy had scored. It was either 15 or 17 way more than Paul&#39;s 8 point PB. <br />
<br />
&#39;You should. They are really good&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe you could lend Madeline some of your books while she is staying at Paul&#39;s. I can&#39;t imagine Paul would have too many books suitable for a young girl&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s alright&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No I insist. We can drop some books around tomorrow&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Err thanks&#39; There were more cheers on court. Paul looked up to see Mandy being hi-fived by his team mates. That score count had just been extended.<br />
<br />
The game finished. Paul&#39;s team won and Mandy was awarded player of the match. He had scored 20 points. That last shot had been a 3-pointer.<br />
<br />
Paul was very glad to get back home. Not only was she strapped back into the booster seat. Des and Dave couldn&#39;t stop talking about what a brilliant game Paul had played. To make matters worse as Naomi unbuckled her from the car seat Naomi told Mandy &#39;Tell your Mum I and Kimberly will be dropping around tomorrow morning with some books that Kimberly thinks Madeline might like to read&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Will do&#39; said Mandy with a big grin on Paul&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Once back inside Paul immediately tried using the medallion once more but as previously nothing happened when he touched it to his own clothes. He could feel tears forming in his eyes as he faced the possibility that his change could be permanent. He could be stuck like this for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Mandy comforted her. It felt strange to be cuddled by his own body but he knew it was his mother inside. &#39;No matter what happens we&#39;ll stick together and I&#39;ll look after you&#39; Mandy told her.<br />
<br />
Paul went to bed. She was very tired. She put on her own pyjamas even though they were way to big for her. The second her head hit the pillow she was asleep.<br />
<br />
Mandy meanwhile booted up her laptop and Googled medallions that could magically change people. Almost immediately she identified thay had stumbled across something called the Medallion Of Zulo. He read with great interest how it worked and what it could do. He finally went to bed satisfied that in the morning he would be able to become a woman once more.</p>
