<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In their private chamber the two in one body continued to fiddle with the <br />
armor, Tabra giving Janice precise step by step instructions. <br />
<br />
Between steps, Janice said to Tabra, 'You two sounded like you didn't get <br />
along when you met before, care to share?' Speaking mentally at least had <br />
become second nature. <br />
<br />
'I'm more than happy to share my memories, Janice, I'm serious, you need to <br />
stop relying on discussion things using a medium of -words- and share them <br />
purely in the form of thoughts and ideas, there is no possibility for error when <br />
you don't need to rely on crude words.'<br />
<br />
'I like using words thank you very much.'<br />
<br />
'And the further things go along, the more they'll slow you down. But as to why <br />
myself and Julio chafe. The truth of the matter is that I can trust him only so <br />
far.'<br />
<br />
'Why?' <br />
<br />
'Julio may hold his friends dear to him, I won't deny that. But you -must- <br />
understand: his ultimate loyalty is to find every fragment of the Knowledge no <br />
matter who has it, what disguise it's in, where he must go, or what he must do <br />
to claim it.' <br />
<br />
'He doesn't seem like that kind of person.'<br />
<br />
'The sentient mind is a fantastic thing. In a way, you and I are just a <br />
transparent version of it. We each have different faces that we show for <br />
different situations and peoples. When the library of Alexandra was burning, <br />
he didn't even try to stop the fires, though it wasn't in direct violation of his <br />
oath, he just found the piece of The Knowledge hidden in the stonework and <br />
left.'<br />
<br />
'What did -you- do?' <br />
<br />
'I wasn't there personally, this was part of Azrael's report, and before you say <br />
it: no, Azrael doesn't misinterpret, make cases of mistaken identity, <br />
exaggerate, lie for his own ends, and sorry, it wasn't a frame up. I'm, we, are <br />
supposed to exist outside the equation, we aren't supposed to screw with <br />
events and people's choices unless we're given the green light. Julio, except <br />
for using his powers for something like subjugating a country or making <br />
everyone in an office building his personal servant, is a part of the equation <br />
and is free to act.'<br />
<br />
'Well I'm sure he had his reasons.'<br />
<br />
'Why are you so quick to defend him but attack me?'<br />
<br />
'No I'm not.' <br />
<br />
'It's because he's human while I'm not, and thus he automatically has more <br />
hands on experience than me and thus must have a clearer view of things.' <br />
<br />
'What?'<br />
<br />
'You were thinking that at the back of your awareness, I could hear it as plain <br />
as day without trying. If you stopped wasting time hiding thoughts from me <br />
you'd hear all my background thoughts too. I won't try to compare hardships <br />
with Julio because to be honest that is always pointless, everyone's journey is <br />
their own. But Janice... I have known him longer than you.'<br />
<br />
'Are you saying that if Tammy had a piece of this knowledge-&quot;<br />
<br />
'The Knowledge.'<br />
<br />
'The Knowledge, that he'd turn on us if Tammy said so?'<br />
<br />
'Or just drop all pretenses and try to grab it from Tamthis with totally reckless <br />
abandon with all the strategy of a herd of buffalo. He wants the complete <br />
Knowledge Janice. He wants it more dearly than any material desire you or <br />
any of your ancestors ever had. And that kind of desire, makes him more <br />
dangerous than you could imagine. Since he doesn't know when Judgment <br />
Day is anymore than any being in creation save Three, he doesn't know how <br />
long he has to collect all the piece of The Knowledge and see Jehovah as a <br />
living man before the sand in the hour glass runs out.' <br />
<br />
'So it's like . . . . it's exactly like us and saving Tammy? We have no idea how <br />
long she has before there's nothing left of her, but if we do something stupid <br />
we won't have any chance of saving her.'<br />
<br />
'Pretty much, but Julio's been at his quest a lot longer than you'll be on this <br />
one. And that can sometimes push a human to making gambles... gambles <br />
that can back fire.' <br />
<br />
'So trust but verify?'<br />
<br />
'Precisely.' Tabra looked down at the armor they were retrofitting, it was slow <br />
going. She honestly didn't like the idea of fusing with Janice either, she liked <br />
being herself. But at the same time, she knew that it was like putting off a trip <br />
to the dentist, the longer you wait the worst it'll get. Truth be told, she could be <br />
scared too. He gathered up his courage for what he had to do next. 'Janice, <br />
there's something I want to share with you. It'll smooth things out for when we <br />
fuse.'<br />
<br />
'Actually there was something else too.' Janice thought, 'something that's <br />
been going around in my, well, I guess our head.'<br />
<br />
'Maybe we are starting to fuse after all.'<br />
<br />
'Huh?' <br />
<br />
Tabra mentally chuckled. 'You think very loudly Janice, I was about to bring <br />
up this point myself.'<br />
<br />
'And if I tried to think quietly?'<br />
<br />
'Don't even joke Janice.' Tabra said, not thunderously like normally, but, <br />
melancholy, even, just plain sympathetic.  'You trying to think quietly will lead <br />
to one result. Instead of merging, you'd become a piggy backer in our brain, <br />
instead of having co-ownership of the house, you'd just be renting out a room. <br />
Worst case scenario? Your Ego would be assimilated by mine rather than the <br />
two of us becoming one awareness. You'd be deader than dead.' <br />
<br />
'You... you've thought of doing the same thing, leaving me in this strange body <br />
all alone!' <br />
<br />
'You're finally opening up. You can actually hear my background thoughts. <br />
Clamming up -does- normally make you more unable to understand others <br />
than vice versa. Well, in this context at least.' <br />
<br />
'Don't change the subject.'<br />
<br />
'Heh. Good for you, I was afraid you'd go off on a rant that 'context' was just an <br />
excuse used by people who don't know what they're saying.'<br />
<br />
'Tabra!'<br />
<br />
'You actually said my name... thank you. And yes, I was thinking of becoming <br />
the piggy back to be assimilated by you,  if it became the ultimate learning <br />
experience for you, if you realized Truth because of it, then you wouldn't have <br />
to cease to exist as Janice, and my duty as Angel isn't violated.' <br />
<br />
'You were willing to... because you were... I thought you were taking a <br />
coward's way out.'<br />
<br />
'I think that's me leaking into you. The cowardice of suicide isn't exactly a <br />
widely embraced idea among atheists, well, the ones I've met at least. Maybe <br />
your family is just different.' <br />
<br />
'My family, my sisters here, mom, dad, my brothers back home. Will Karther <br />
stop?'<br />
<br />
'Karther would have, he's not that stupid, but Tamthis, there's a chance he/she <br />
might be dumb enough to endlessly expand, and that's where the thunder is <br />
brought down.'<br />
<br />
 'So, what's this thing that once I realize it will smooth out our fused personality <br />
when it happens?'<br />
<br />
'First understand that I don't like this either. It means the person MY family, MY <br />
brothers/sisters know won't exist anymore. Same as you.'<br />
<br />
'Okay. I think I can. I always just figured that if Angels DID somehow <br />
'magically' exist, they'd be emotionless robots.' <br />
<br />
'Following the rules doesn't mean everyone is exactly alike. Now Janice, I can <br />
feel you're close to making the realization. You have to make it yourself <br />
though. Now, what have you been thinking?'<br />
<br />
'About Julio.'<br />
<br />
'What about him?'<br />
<br />
'His seal.'<br />
<br />
'What about it.'<br />
<br />
'What you said.'<br />
<br />
'What did I say about it?'<br />
<br />
'That it was where the Jews got their blue print for the universe.' <br />
<br />
'And?'<br />
<br />
'You said that it was imprinted on every human in existence.'<br />
<br />
'And what were humans made in the image of?' <br />
<br />
Janice tried to stop herself from thinking, she didn't want to realize this!<br />
<br />
'Let it go Janice, let it come, don't be afraid, I'm right here with you.'<br />
<br />
'They were made in God's appearance. But if that seal is a part of every <br />
human, and if humans are made in God's image, and the Jews use the seal's <br />
design as the blue print of the universe... But that means that, that, that god <br />
would, would be-'  Janice's thoughts began to try and stick themselves in a <br />
loop to stop from cross over the equal sign. <br />
<br />
'Think it Janice, you can't escape the conclusion now, you're not stupid <br />
enough.' <br />
<br />
'Being smart is what mom and dad always told me would -stop- me from <br />
thinking this!' <br />
<br />
'Live and learn: rule of life! Now just let go!' <br />
<br />
' . . . . that God . . . '<br />
<br />
Silence. <br />
<br />
From the outside view, the fox angel sat there on her knees in front of the <br />
armor, her body shaking and her face in shock. <br />
<br />
'That this universe, it wasn't just created by God, it's -generated- by God.'<br />
<br />
'As Mark Twain said when he wasn't attacking people's faith: 'you are but, a <br />
thought.' ' <br />
<br />
The fox angel slumped and fell over backwards, hitting her head against the <br />
sand. <br />
<br />
Janice had fainted. Tabra got up, and shook her head. Janice's sleep was <br />
nearly dreamless. Just wisps of thoughts and ideas. <br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn't make you less of a sentient being, nor make your choices <br />
any less -real-.&quot; Tabra finished. &quot;I'm sorry Janice, I'm just so sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Somewhere in japan, in two villages not too far away from each other, a <br />
female kitsune sat on the roof of a bar, or the local place of worship. Both <br />
could feel the other close by.  But they could also feel the force of change on <br />
the winds as it brushed over their five tails. They knew the storm clouds were <br />
beginning to build thousand upon thousands of miles away, but still they <br />
could feel it. <br />
<br />
They wondered if maybe, they should try to backtrack on their choices, and go <br />
see what they could do for the coming storm. But looking at the people below, <br />
they felt it in their gut. This place was their responsibility now. They couldn't <br />
abandon it. If Tamthis and Karther's sandy wind blew all the way to their new <br />
homes... they'd protect it... and the perverted prince of kitsune would never lay <br />
a paw on their charges. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
The recruits hadn't exactly thought about it before, but during what they <br />
unanimously nick named their Transcendence, each of them had lost their <br />
extra tail. They weren't kitsune now by any means, so it made sense.  <br />
<br />
Another thought that occurred to them was that they felt no sense of shame of <br />
being just in the fur, they had formed the custom gis around themselves only <br />
at Julio's request and nothing more. While they could still see the -reason- <br />
behind protective garments in a hostile environment, like they would soon be <br />
entering, they felt no -need- to 'hide'  themselves. They were neither repulsed <br />
or attracted to the idea of attire. It existed for function and nothing more. <br />
<br />
Luna had been trying a way to describe the pain she felt when Julio had <br />
blasted her into a wall. It wasn't intense, it wasn't dull, or she'd hardly describe <br />
it as 'simply was.' She kept thinking back to the pain she felt when Janice/<br />
Tabra had changed her. While the pain had been more blindly powerful than <br />
anything she had experienced before, it hardly made everything else feel like <br />
a pin prick. <br />
<br />
Asking her sisters, they admitted to the same thing. Well, Erica said she <br />
wanted to say that the pain didn't feel that bad, but it honestly had. Lisa said it <br />
felt like a tooth being pulled everywhere. Viki said she felt like every fiber on <br />
her body had been on fire, but more like it was burning away rather than <br />
consuming. <br />
<br />
Viki had snapped her fingers, and spoke, &quot;It was mundane.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Erica wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;The pain Luna felt when she was blasted was mundane! You know, like <br />
Janice keeps calling our flesh and blood wings mundane, while the wings we <br />
know are there but aren't materially she keeps calling our true wings. The <br />
pain Luna felt was -mundane- pain! That's why it felt different from the pain we <br />
felt when were changed. Janice said she changed our -spirits- into angels <br />
and our bodies just followed suit as much as they could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna thought about it, &quot;So the pain we felt when we changed was closer to <br />
home. While the pain I felt when Julio blasted me was the kind we're used to <br />
feeling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Viki asked, &quot;Why were you trying so hard to figure it out anyway?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just that it no longer felt like 'the pain' that I'm used to thinking of as pain, and <br />
it was instead 'a pain' when I got smashed into that wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom always said, &quot; Erica brought up. &quot;Pain's just your body telling you <br />
you're hurt. If you mentally acknowledge that you are hurt, rather than <br />
pretending you don't feel it, she said you should be able to function in spite of <br />
it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that actually work?&quot; Luna asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Was never sure.&quot; Erica answered honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever keeps your head above water.&quot; Viki pointed out. &quot;And we're gonna <br />
need it.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't a dream.&quot; Janice mumbled out loud when she came to. <br />
<br />
'Sorry no it wasn't.' Tabra said, she hadn't touched the armor in the two hours <br />
Janice had been out. <br />
<br />
'I was out for two hours?'<br />
<br />
'You needed it.' Tabra hadn't touched anything in the room since Janice had <br />
realized the truth of things. <br />
<br />
Janice cried, she felt empty, broken, betrayed. She always told herself that <br />
she was still a male inside, and that men didn't cry, but here she was, crying <br />
all the same. <br />
<br />
Tabra hugged herself, and thus hugged Janice, pulling their mundane wings <br />
around them like like a protective cocoon. <br />
<br />
'Even as all of this was happening.' Janice confessed. 'I kept telling myself, <br />
even if Angel's exist, God doesn't. Then if God does exist, he's not important. <br />
He's just there, it doesn't matter if he exists or not. Now you make me find out -<br />
this!-'<br />
<br />
'You were about to realize it on your own Janice, better to realize it now than <br />
when we're fighting Tamthis or when we fused. Get it all out, just let go, no <br />
one is in here but us, it's okay, it's all okay, don't worry.'<br />
<br />
'I never thought of it like a faith, it couldn't -be- a faith in my mind. I never <br />
realized the satisfaction I felt, the comfort, that me and my family were united <br />
that way.' <br />
<br />
'Faiths are never thought of as faiths by the people who practice them. Never. <br />
Not even once. Not in the course of entirety of human history! To them, they <br />
are truth/fact/reality, nothing more, nothing less. To the people of a faith, it's an <br />
acceptance of truth, not a belief.'<br />
<br />
'Even with all of this happening, I didn't want to see the parallel.'<br />
<br />
'But you did all the same.'<br />
<br />
'And I didn't want to.'<br />
<br />
'So you tried your hardest not to think about it.'<br />
<br />
'But there was no way for that to work.'<br />
<br />
'Because you're just too bright.'<br />
<br />
'It was said: once you're part of a religion, you're saying 'I decided to be stupid' <br />
but it doesn't actually work like that after all huh?' <br />
<br />
'Not really.'<br />
<br />
'You were about to say that 'surprising how many things are said, and how <br />
many of them are or are not true' weren't you? You use the word 'surprising' a <br />
lot.'<br />
<br />
'Life is full of surprises, that's how it works.'  <br />
<br />
Janice realized she had stopped crying, she actually felt at peace, almost... <br />
free. <br />
<br />
'Tabra.' <br />
<br />
'Second time you used my name, you have no idea how happy that makes <br />
me.'<br />
<br />
'Actually I think I do. Thank you.' <br />
<br />
The angel fox stayed inside her angel wings for over an hour, merely sitting <br />
there hugging herself, her eyes closed with an oddly serene look on her face.</p>
