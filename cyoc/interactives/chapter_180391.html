<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Heh...you really want that &quot;atch&quot; don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank barely even realized anything was wrong as he watched the very small child in the back desperately trying to grab that &quot;atch&quot;. He barely noticed that his vaunted muscular build, the result of years of work since his very young teenage years, had drastically diminished, and he also barely noticed his face was rounded and boyish, more tween than teen. He also didn&#39;t even notice that he had gone from the office playboy to the office boy. And then the kid finally got that &quot;atch&quot; and there was a sound something like a click.<br />
<br />
That got Officer Hank Blanchford&#39;s attention. He tilted his head and started to realize something was going horribly awry. For some reason, the young man, who was used to wearing his police uniform tight and flirting around, was now barely able to fit in his uniform at all. In fact he was swimming in it. Realization started to hit. Dread sinking in. Hank desperately reached for the rear view mirror and turned it to look at himself.<br />
<br />
What he saw made him press his back up against his seat and scream in horror.<br />
<br />
He saw himself as an eleven year old pre-teen. Hank Blanchford was thus left with his fully adult, cognizant mind as an eleven year old child sitting in a pile of police clothes. His usually trim black hair was now in a thick, bushy mess on his head. His bright blue eyes were now wild with fear, looking up at the rearview mirror. He did not take long, with his policeman&#39;s mind, to figure out what in all had caused him to turn from a man in the peak of his life...<br />
<br />
...into a young boy indeed, sitting there desperate and so very afraid.<br />
<br />
The watch. Of course! He barely even noticed the feeling of it. It was barely a tickle. The kid, she had been trying to get him to notice and help her turn off the &quot;atch&quot;! Because it was regressing him, and if he had to guess based on the evidence, of her and the power the watch had demonstrated, then she had most likely suffered a similar fate to Hank!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fucking shit...&quot; Hearing himself cuss in such a voice was admittedly kind of odd. Though he didn&#39;t intend to stop ANY time soon. &quot;Fuck...whatever this fucking thing is, it turned me into this skinny piece of shit.&quot; He chuckled at himself somewhat morbidly, and then started taking stock of his position, &quot;Okay, I gotta find a way to get some new clothes, get some people over here, and find some way to either get my old body back, or at least work on making this one not so wimpy.&quot; Hank accentuated this by flexing his arm and seeing his miniscule bicep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Blanchford, come in. Status Report.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank got an idea. Much as he hated abusing the system like this... &quot;Uhh 10:53, 10:53, I just found his car like this. 10:53! There&#39;s a kid like, like a baby in the backseat and---and I dunno what to do!&quot; Hank gulped and hoped this worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid, you might&#39;ve just saved an innocent child&#39;s life. We&#39;re sending someone over to pick the kid up.&quot; And then the comms went out, and Hank cupped his chin. No way could he stay in here if he could get regressed like that by proximity. And with other officers on their way, this left Hank with his other prerogatives. He cupped his chin and shook his head. He wasn&#39;t gonna like it, but he had very little choice.<br />
<br />
He tried to fasten his belt to make his pants stay up, walking around in just those, but the pants were made for a much more muscular, tall and powerfully built police officer. Not for an eleven year old kid. Hank grumbled to himself as he tried to find his way back to his home, his keys still in his pocket. He remembered he had a few sets of clothes up in the attic he kept due to them being gifts from relatives all the way back from when he was a kid.<br />
<br />
Hank grimaced when he heard some passing teens chuckle at him walking home like that, one of them shouting, &quot;Looks like somebody lost a dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank fired back over his shoulder, &quot;Ah go fuck yourself you shit for brains teeny-bopper fuckface!&quot; This made the teens pause and give each other some seriously weirded out looks. Since when did THAT happen? One of the teens shouted back, &quot;Well uhhh, fuck you right back!&quot; But the others just kept walking - the more time they wasted on shouting matches with 11 year olds, the more pathetic they&#39;d look. Eventually their friend followed along.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Hank managed to find his house. His house was one bought with a cash loan from his parents and money he got from his job as a cop. It was roughly two stories, but was pretty old and had needed a lot of repairs. Hank grumbled under his breath. He fiddled with his keys and eventually found the one for his house. Once he was inside, Hank locked the front door and made a beeline for the attic. Once he was up there, he started looking through his old clothes. Getting dressed, Hank hoped this wouldn&#39;t be an &quot;all the time&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
Could he perhaps somehow return to his normal age naturally?<br />
<br />
Now wearing a much better fitting t-shirt, jeans and just a pair of socks, Hank went back downstairs carefully. He breathed and looked around. Well, he had made his way back home and was likely out of the range of effect of that watch. Whatever it was. Hopefully he could manage to attain some measure of a normal life. At least he still had his own normal, adult mind.<br />
<br />
That was when Hank heard a knock at the door. He bit his lip and wondered who could be showing up now of all times. &quot;Of all the fucking time...who in the hell...?&quot;</p>
