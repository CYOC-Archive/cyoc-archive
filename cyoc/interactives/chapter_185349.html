<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and your brother now are on the beach after dealing with gangsters. The beach allows to be nude and wear a little bit clothes, since there are all gays here. So there are many nude gay on the beach, and your group are a little bit outstanding because of your rubber muscle body. Sometimes, people will come close to you or your brothers for dreamy looking at your bulk body. For rubber body, the heat from the sun makes you sweat a lot. The sweat make your rubber body shinier and more slippery. “Wow, those boys’ bodies are like rubber.” “Look at those muscle, it’s so sexy.” “Unbelievable, those muscle must be fake.” “Those cute dicks are so long and so big.” And some other comments go on.  <br />
While you and Rob are sitting on the sand beach, look at others play in sea. Rob brings out one of those bicolor thongs out. Those are two colors in left and right of those thongs; red and green, black and white, blue and orange, yellow and violet, and cerulean and red orange, while half thong is clay color. <br />
“What should we do with them?” Rob asks<br />
“Why don’t we sell them or give them to other people?” you suggest<br />
“I don’t know. I mean we don’t know exactly what is going to happen when people wear them.” Rob says<br />
“You’re right. We can’t just give it to anyone.” You replies while fingering rubber feature of it. The thong is so smooth, and you feel sensitive on your fingers while fingering it. <br />
Rob and you put them in the picnic basket and put the lunch out of it. Rob stands up and calls “Guys, it&#39;s midday, now. Time to eat.” Seven of them happily cheer and run back to you and Rob. People around us, even chuckle at your family’s antic and watch your group. ‘If Max is here, it’ll be better’ you think fondly.<br />
As your family have lunch, some people are still watching. But you all don’t care at all, then a volleyball flow at your group. All you are shocked by the volleyball suddenly falling in center of your group. While Eric is grapping the ball, you hear a young male voice from behind “I’m sorry to disturb you, kids.” <br />
You look at the person the young man in tight black swim briefs. The young man has tan skin, except his crotch that he wears the swim briefs, as if he comes to this beach every day. While you is eyeing the man, he looks at Leon and says “Ahh.. I remember you, the orange rubber boy who usually swims at the beach.” Now Leon smiles cheekily while you still look at the man.<br />
The man sees that you are looking at him, introduces “My name is Mike. Nice to meet you, kids.” <br />
“My name is Rob, the oldest.” “Hi, I’m Eric.” “My name’s Alex.” “My name’s Leon.” “I’m Carl. Nice to meet you, too.” “I’m Tom, the older twins.” “And I’m Isaac, the younger twins.” “My names is Sam, the youngest.” <br />
After introduction, Mike eyes all of you and says “Man, you all really is addict to rubber, aren’t you.  And your rubber suit is so realistic. Even your muscle and your dick shape are, too. If I don’t know any better, I’ll think you guys are rubber sex dolls.” All of you awkwardly laugh at his proclaim. <br />
You who want to change the topic as well as your brothers, says “We just love to wear them. And what about Mike? From we see you, you joint the beach club or something?” <br />
Mike smiles widely and proudly replies “Yes, my boys. I have joint the beach club week ago. I have grown my muscle and skin is tanned. I’m proud to be one of manly bleach men.”  Mike flexes his muscle to his perfect body while you all look at him with different emotions. <br />
“Hey Mike, what take you so long? Get the ball and come back already?” another tanned muscle guy with same pattern briefs as Mike, calls his friend. <br />
“I have to go, boys. Our club welcomes you all anytime. See you later.” Mike says while carrying the volleyball and running back to his club mates. <br />
 All of you look at Mike long times, before Jung who break the silent, asks “You guys think as I think, right?”<br />
“Yes” you and others chimed at same time.<br />
Tom says “I bet that every members wear the same briefs.” <br />
“Yes, and I bet they join the nude safeguard serving every men on this beach” Eric jokes while Rob shakes his head for Eric’s naughty comments. <br />
“Joke aside, I haven’t seen our wolf friend around here.” Rob cautiously says as you nod. <br />
Isaac replies “I don’t think the werewolf would come to open area in this hot, if Carl said that it wore raincoat.” As your groups’ decision, we should go to the beach because it would get everyone’s attention for wearing too much clothes in the beach. <br />
“So what are we going to do after the lunch?” Leon curiously asks while looking around.<br />
You suggest “We can stay here until our work shift. Or anyone has other idea.” No one says any idea, so your group stay here longer. This time, you and Rob play with your brothers in the sea and leave the basket and other things on the sand beach. With cold of sea water, you feel much better after bathing in sunshine. ‘Ahhh, I’m in the heaven.’ You feel so relax while flowing on the sea.   <br />
You hear your brothers’ voices “hey, it’s not fair.” “Catch me if you can.” “Don’t go too far, Carl Eric”<br />
You chuckle, and then you flow and hit someone’s back. When you turn back, you see shiny blue sexy muscle back. And you quickly apologize to Jung as he does it, too. And Jung, who has friendly smile on his face, asks “Have you ever thought that your life will become like this?”<br />
You laugh and say “No, not even dream about it. I planned to have fun here couple of days, and then went back to my home. Mon, Dad and my younger brother, Max would worry about me.”<br />
Jung smiles fondly at you and he says “Mine, too. My parents and my sister will worry about me.”<br />
“Your sister?” You curiously ask and Jung fondly says “Yes, My oldest sister to be exact. She is married a rich man and gave birth her son 4 years ago. Her son, Bao is cute boy.”<br />
You hold Jung’s hand in the sea, Jung looks at your face that have smile on it. We may not be biological brothers but we still are family. “Thank, Bro.” Jung says.   <br />
“Hey, you thieves stop right there.” Eric looks at sand beach, shouts loudly. You and Jung immediately look back and indeed, there are three naked boy around your age are running away with thongs in each of their hand.<br />
Without think, all of you chase after the thieves. “Where are those guys running off?” You asks after checking that there are only 2 thongs and a half thong left. <br />
Rob seriously says “We need to find them. We don’t know what’s going to happen if they wear those undies.”</p>
