<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The summer was in full swing and life wasn&#39;t going according to plan. Ryan, the father of two boys, had always had dreams of being a great dad, a buff and burly beast, living happily with his children and wife, in a house surrounded by a white picket fence. He couldn&#39;t help having that portion of the dream that was so stereotypical for a guy growing up in the era that he did. Born in the early 1980s, Ryan still had a social impartation of what was expected from men... not at all what it was like in the time that he lived in where there were no societal norms for men or expectations to follow. While it was a bit of a relief to not have such a heavy burden placed on his shoulders, one that he would have had to carry and fulfill if he was born to an earlier era... it was a little disappointing to him as well since there was nothing to really live up to. However, in the life that he was given... the life he had no choice over... Ryan was an example of how life didn&#39;t necessarily work in a person&#39;s favor, following their interests and desires nor their hopes and dreams.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s desire to be a father, though he was born a gay man, was hard and filled with turmoil, but he managed to make it happen. At first, Ryan lived a lie like so many others in his shoes had to do. It was a survival thing... a way to make sure he would keep on living... even if he was incredibly unhappy doing it. He never, however, cheated on his wife by going to sleep with another man and if he was horny, he&#39;d get incredibly intoxicated in order to be intimate with the woman he married. Thankfully, Ryan was able to get two awesome sons... a pair of paternal twins out of the first go round with her, which meant he could have the life he wanted without tormenting himself. He could live with her... he thought. Ryan could be a great dad to his twins and he was... for many, many years. Having the house that Ryan wanted, the body as well... well... that was a whole different story. The house never worked out, Ryan could never work out the finances the way he needed and wanted to with his wife. The body part never worked out because it never wanted to cooperate. No matter how hard he tried, no matter what supplement he took... he never could make it happen. Ryan had even had dreams of someone being a werewolf and share that with him to get the body he desired, since every version of the beast Ryan was interested in seeing was a big, monsterous, hulking beast of a man and then even more so once the initial transformation took place... along with how they would look as the wolf. Even his two sons, Brandon and Ethan had an interest in werewolves since they saw how their dad liked them and enjoyed them too. It was never something Ryan had imparted on them... they just seemed to have a genuine interest in werewolves as well. Thing was... Ryan would soon find out why that was exactly.<br />
<br />
As the years went on and society became more and more open with homosexuality... as well as several different sexualities and ways of thinking that wasn&#39;t something Ryan was accustomed to... he welcomed it and tried his best to understand. One day, when Ryan couldn&#39;t take the lies anymore and the skirting around the truth... he decided it was best that he came clean with everyone at the same time. He decided to call a family meeting well after dinner, just to make sure things were easier and more comfortable since the day would be on the decline and end anyway. With the three others around him, his wife of nearly the same age of thirty-five and his two sons, both fourteen, Ryan had told them all the truth. Of course, his wife was incredibly upset and angry, claiming she had a feeling she married a faggot... which was when the two boys stepped up and declared that they were also gay and knew from an early age that this was the case. This made her even more upset and stormed out of the meeting, packed up her personal belongings and left him to deal with them and live as a trio of gay men. Curious... he asked his sons how long they knew that they were, which was the same thing he knew about himself. They knew they were gay, separately, early on in life... around five or six. Sure... it wasn&#39;t sexual, but they did like &quot;girl&quot; things. They told him as they grew up, they were curious about themselves and what the other looked like... which they had a bath together as an experiment. Then, with the invention of the internet, they started looking at females and never got the same feeling about them that they did when looking at other men. They just didn&#39;t care, but found huge interest in the male form... especially when they got into looking at male werewolves, their transformations and so on.<br />
<br />
Since she was out of the picture and they couldn&#39;t afford the life they did have, that was when Ryan went looking for alternatives. He had looked at adds, set up accounts on sites that were specifically for searching for places to live. When he was about to give up, going to close his laptop, there was a notification that dinged on his computer. Curious about it, Ryan pushed the screen back up and started reading over the chat window. It was a person offering the cabin in the woods, completely free, no requirements from them... other than they would just need to live there happily with whatever they desired in life to be at the forefront of their minds. Ryan thought it was an odd request... and even odder that someone would be giving it away at no cost. Ryan even questioned what the catch was and was told that there wasn&#39;t one. The reason the cabin was being given away was that no one wanted to live there... it was too remote... too far away from civilization for the liking of everyone he propositioned when there was a cost, so... it was decided to just give it away. He also lamented that he wished he could keep it, but it was too far away to go out there, enjoy it and even take care of it properly. If Ryan was willing to accept the terms, the stranger on the other end would just leave the keys under the welcome mat and he could take ownership upon arrival.<br />
<br />
Once everything was set at home, which didn&#39;t take long since they sold everything the trio had in order to make the move with the least amount of crap that they could have in their possession, the trio set off and ventured to the remote cabin. When they pulled up to it in the middle of the forest, the trio looked at it in awe and wonder, curious as to how someone didn&#39;t want to own this place... even though it really was far away from any city. They wondered the logistics of such a place... how there could be food, water, electricity, and other amenities, but they also didn&#39;t want to question it too much... in fear of losing such an amazing opportunity. As they stepped foot onto the front stoop, the cabin knew exactly what the trio wanted. It could feel how they all wanted to be big, burly, thick cocked, overproducing precum and cum beasts to enjoy each other in numerous sexual exploits. If the cabin could have grinned, it would have as it was definitely able to make their dreams come true. The cabin would make the father the werewolf first... a huge, monstrous, beefy beast with a cock the three of them all enjoyed thinking about and the other two, Brandon and Ethan, would enjoy their father sexually and each be given the same for their father to enjoy in return.</p>
