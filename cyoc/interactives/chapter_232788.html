<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But she wasn’t back to normal. Though fully lucid, she still felt amazing. She threw herself out of bed with enough force she half expected to hit a wall, then bolted to her full-length mirror. <br />
<br />
The body she saw in her reflection was the same one from the dream. In the span of a few minutes, she went from a fairly pretty college girl to the envy of supermodels. Strictly speaking, she wasn’t quite as perfect as in the dream. Her generous new boobs weren’t quite parallel to the ground. The faint light bleeding through her curtains wasn’t enough to make her hair and skin glisten. Her clothing had stretched and shrunk to show off her new body, but they showed the same signs of wear as before.<br />
<br />
Even then, the reality exceeded her wildest dreams.<br />
<br />
She brought her hands up to her face and was stunned at how good her own skin felt-- smooth as marble, soft as down feathers. Her whole face tingled as she rolled her fingers on her cheeks, feeling every slight bump and crevice of her fingerprints. Her lips were painted a gentle pink; her nails were perfectly manicured, with the index and middle fingers trimmed short; and her long lashes were paired with a line of eye shadow. It all looked like professional cosmetics, but she ran her fingers over each area and felt nothing. It was like her skin had naturally pigmented, and her nails trimmed themselves. <br />
<br />
She brought a single hand back beneath her shoulder blades, not even stretching as she undid the clasp of her bra in a single, seemingly practiced motion. As the bra fell to the floor, Jen felt no additional weight or sag from her chest. “Goodbye and good riddance,” she thought with a giggle. Her other hand went down just above her belly button and pressed into her midriff. Her skin was just as luxurious there, but underneath was a new, hidden layer of muscle. Her finger traced a set of washboard abs, smaller than her boyfriend’s, but far more dense.<br />
<br />
Jen wrapped her arms underneath her breasts as she stared longingly in the mirror. God, she felt sexy. She pouted her lips and stared again with half-lidded eyes. Some irrational part of her mind wanted to walk straight into the mirror and follow this pretty lady to bed. She moved through several more poses, body euphoria glowing brighter each time. She was always a nimble girl; she had to be as a cheerleader, but her movements now were so precise, so effortless. It made her old body seem clumsy by comparison.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s new body was beautiful, it was brimming with life, and it was truly hers. Her thoughts, her appearance, her movements, everything felt so in sync in that moment… it didn’t matter where this body came from. This was her true self now; her old body was a cheap imitation. She loved herself; she felt so hot she couldn’t stand it. Without even thinking, one hand crept down below her waistline.<br />
<br />
Her knees buckled as she struggled to keep her hand still. “So sensitive…” she gasped out. Her pelvic muscles held two fingers in a death grip, both already soaked from her snatch. She hadn’t even touched her clit yet. As soon as she loosened herself enough, she went to work massaging every inch of her vagina with one hand while the other rubbed and pinched her nipples. This wasn’t just her best masturbation session, this was competing for the best sex she’d ever had.<br />
<br />
In no time at all, Jennifer was moaning as her hips began bucking uncontrollably against her hand. Then the moans became a cry of release as she gushed out over her hand and the inside of her skirt. “Guess I’m not wearing this today, shame I hadn’t gotten my panties on yet,” she giggled. She should’ve been embarrassed or frustrated at cumming all over herself when she was already running late for class, but she felt too good to be worked up over it. She wasn’t even breathing hard after getting all worked up--<br />
<br />
Class! The word snapped her back to attention. As much as she wanted to stay home and fawn over herself, she still had a life to get back to. Besides, all her friends were there, and she really wanted to see if they’d change like in the dream. Her body surged with power and energy. Jen wasn’t really a distance runner, unless you counted a treadmill, but she genuinely felt like she could do a marathon today. She threw off her wet skirt, then grabbed all 4 layers of her bedding with her other hand, stripping the bed in a single pull as she ran for the hamper.<br />
<br />
Jennifer’s mind raced, faster and more clearly than she’d ever experienced. A photographic memory of her phone’s screen appeared in her mind. She hadn’t consciously noticed the time, but the clock said 8:15 AM, she instantly counted forward from then to now… 12min, 18sec, making it roughly 8:27… missed the school shuttle... parking lots will be packed with everyone taking midterms, so no car. Besides, she had someone to meet before class. 100 or more mental images of the suburbs along the shuttle’s route stitched together into a mental map of the route in the time it took for her to drop the laundry off.<br />
<br />
As she raced back to her closet to get dressed, she mentally double-checked the houses along the route. Driveways, alleys, low-fenced and open yards, all marked on her mental map. She filed that away for a moment to mentally confirm where all her clothes should be, then ripped open a drawer to pull out a cute little off-shoulder top and her remaining sock. She then lifted her bed, frame and all, with one hand to fish her long-lost pair of yoga pants out from underneath. Like her other clothes, these had all resized to fit, (even if the top showed a little midriff now) but they also had a little extra padding in the front, enough to hide even her exaggerated nipples and camel toe. <br />
<br />
By all accounts, Jen should’ve been mortified at the idea of going out with no bra or underwear, but in the moment, it felt sexy and fun. “Easy access, boys and girls,” she giggled at herself again as she blew a parting kiss at the mirror.<br />
<br />
By the time she opened the door with all her things, Jen had finished and double-checked her plan, but she took a moment to view her surroundings before getting on her way. It was like a filter had been removed from all her senses. The colors were more vibrant than ever, even for a beautiful spring morning. She saw clouds overhead, she heard birdsong in the distance, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath, smelling a hint of a flower garden the next block over. All in such overwhelming detail.<br />
<br />
The moment ended, she opened her eyes, and she went from standing still to a dead sprint like her body was spring-loaded. A waist-high fence came up as she ran to the house opposite hers, just enough to keep a small dog from running loose. She vaulted over, only touching the fence once to bring her legs back underneath her. Jen had never tried parkour, but the motor cortex of her enhanced brain did all the work in real time. The jump propelled her most of the way across, so she raised one leg to avoid hitting the neighbor’s corgi and simply rolled over the other side of the fence on her opposite shoulder.  She kept moving, cutting the most direct path through the neighborhood to her goal. Even carrying a full backpack and clearing obstacles, she was easily hitting over 15mph (~24kph) on the way.</p>
