<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Donovan couldn&#39;t believe how well he slept from the night before. Normally he would have tossed and turned, or worse, slept wrong and woken up with a sore shoulder. But he felt better than he had in years. His body moved easily, and he woke up early enough to actually go on that run he&#39;d always tell himself that he&#39;d do. But this time actually do it. &quot;Why the hell not?&quot; he reasoned as he put on some sweats. Before he knew it, he was stretching and then out the door on the morning jog.<br />
<br />
The air was crisp, and he felt better than ever. Even as he rounded his second mile, he still wanted to keep going. But knowing that 2 miles was usually all he could get in, he headed back home. A quick shower and quicker breakfast and then he was out the door. Though, when he saw his son&#39;s car, he did take a moment to think about whether or not he came back the night prior. He suddenly remembered a time with Jackson and Mark having sex in Jackson&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just send a text later...&quot; he said to himself. The thought of his little son being able to top such a beast was impressive. And at no point did he want to seem like an overly controlling father. His son should be able to have fun with his boyfriend without him having to interrupt. <br />
<br />
With a short drive to work, Donovan felt a little odd again. Maybe it was just the way he walked a little taller or how he wasn&#39;t quite the butt of everyone&#39;s jokes right now, but he felt weird. The other guys just kept staring at him. They&#39;d pretend not whenever he&#39;d look at them. However, that didn&#39;t stop him from catching the obvious glance, if not outright stare at his ass. He couldn&#39;t deny that it looked good in the tight jeans. The denim clung tightly to everything, and now he was wearing a sleeveless shirt showing off his powerful arms and shoulders instead of his normal t shirt. The cool breeze felt good on his skin. <br />
<br />
Work was better than ever. Easier too. Besides the leering looks of the other men clearly trying to hide something they wanted to say, Donovan was having a good time. That&#39;s when he was surprised to feel a hand slap him on the ass. Then give it a firm squeeze. &quot;Donovan,&quot; the familiar firm voice of his boss rang in his ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Donovan jumped at the sudden act. He quickly spun around to see his boss. It felt a bit odd looking down at the man when he&#39;d always been eye level. Though, that didn&#39;t remove any of the authority between them. If anything, Donovan somehow felt even smaller as he stood next to the man, even though he&#39;d gotten so much bigger. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if we speak privately?&quot; his boss said. Then nodded towards his private trailer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Yeah,&quot; Donovan agreed and followed the man over. On the way he could feel the longing looks turn to glares as he passed. Some even vocally scoffing. He eyed them a bit suspiciously but didn&#39;t know what to say. His boss held his head up high, almost parading the other man through the work site. The short walk suddenly felt a lot longer.<br />
<br />
Once inside, his boss shuttered all the windows and locked the door. &quot;Damn... You&#39;re one mighty beast,&quot; he muttered. Then nearly tackled Donovan. Instinct took over and Donovan easily caught him. His boss was not small by normal standards, yet In Donovan&#39;s arms he felt absolutely miniscule. There were at least six inches in height difference between the two and maybe 80 pounds, but without too much as an ounce of fat on Donovan, he was far larger than the other man&#39;s more natural build. <br />
<br />
Moreover, Donovan naturally followed the other man&#39;s lead. He felt like he knew when to lean further in and exactly which direction the other man was going. Even as his boss&#39; fingers dipped down into his muddy jeans, Donovan didn&#39;t flinch. Feeling those dexterous fingers grip his ass and travel further only turned him on more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Such a beast,&quot; his boss cooed, gripping tightly. Donovan moaned. His body seemed to react on its own. However, his throbbing penis made it a bit easier to find the pleasure in the situation. Even as his boss spun him around and pushed Donovan against the wall, he couldn&#39;t help but feel excited. His boss worked at his and Donovan&#39;s belts, dropping their pants to the floor. &quot;How&#39;s this?&quot; his boss whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So big...&quot; Donovan lied. The average sized dick pressed up against his asshole. Even if it were only about five inches, his mouth wouldn&#39;t say anything other than what his boss would have wanted to hear. As it leaked onto his ass, he shuddered. Then when pressed against him, he moaned. His fingers scrapped against the walls of the trailer. &quot;So big...&quot; he moaned louder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh!&quot; his boss ordered. &quot;You&#39;ll get us caught!&quot; However, that didn&#39;t wipe the smile off his face. Half the fun was the danger. Would the other guys know? Most likely. But that didn&#39;t stop it from being less fun. Each thrust was another step closer. Another chance to get caught. Another instance of pure sexual bliss.<br />
<br />
Now his boss was getting a bit louder. Huffing as he thrust over and over again. Donovan could feel the man&#39;s cock throbbing inside him. Begging for more. His fingers dug into his sides as he tried to hold onto the ride beneath him. The boss&#39; moans carried out of him until he finally released. The smaller man fell into the swell of Donovan&#39;s back, panting. Completely out of breath. &quot;You&#39;re so hot...&quot; he squeezed Donovan tighter, nuzzling his face into the other man&#39;s back. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not too bad yourself,&quot; Donovan smiled. He spun around cradling his boss. A bit of red seemed to cover the other man&#39;s face as he pulled it into his chest. &quot;But I&#39;m probably going to have to go back to work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ri-right!&quot; his boss pushed Donovan away and straightened his collar. Even if his pants were still around his ankles, he tried to keep a modicum of respect. &quot;Of course. Work.&quot; However, he paused. &quot;But after..? Would you want to do something after work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Donovan pulled up his dirty jeans. &quot;I&#39;ll have to check. But I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re the first to know.&quot; <br />
<br />
His boss squirmed as Donovan said it. &quot;Ri-right! Well then. Get back to work!&quot; then slapped him on the ass.<br />
<br />
Donovan was all smiles until the door closed behind him. Maybe it was the fact that his boss still hadn&#39;t pulled up his pants, maybe it was just how good he was at pleasing another man, or maybe it was just how much he liked it, but Donovan felt a sense of dread wash over him as he headed back to work.</p>
