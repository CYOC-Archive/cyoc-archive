<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power- The big student gets a little visit – author: scriptboy – idea: collegeboy<br />
<br />
Jon read the email from Peter. He thought about it for a moment, and then he replied to it. He asked Peter for some more muscle, he just wanted to be more muscular than ever. He just wondered how Peter would make him grow, if he were far away, in Canada? So he threw an invitation in there, for Peter to come visit him on campus. He figured it couldn’t hurt having a high school student visit him. There are special tours and seminars for high school kids all the time, so he thought it couldn’t hurt having a teenager visit him in his dorm. <br />
<br />
He included his address and phone number in the email and figured he could add directions as well, making it as easy as possible for Peter to find him in his dorm. When he was finished, he clicked on the Send button in Outlook and watched as the progress bar on the indicated that the email was being sent. When it was done, he got up and walked to the kitchen. He got a soda to drink and a sandwich to eat, and he felt like he was in the mood to go to the gym to work out. He looked outside his dorm room window and noticed that it was pouring rain outside, so he decided to wait until the rain had stopped. He walked to the living room where he had a TV and a small, portable stereo. He turned it on and sat on the couch, listening to the music. He was wearing a tank top and a pair of shorts, socks and sneakers, for he was ready to go to the gym. But he decided to wait.<br />
<br />
As he sat on the couch, he felt himself getting drowsy as he was about to fall asleep, when he heard a vaguely familiar voice. “Don’t let the weather stop you from working out, big guy! You need to grow some more muscle today.” Jon opened his eyes and looked around, when he noticed a teenage boy in the room, leaning against the wall. He was about 5’8” and muscular, wearing a black basketball jersey, matching black shorts, and black Air Jordans. He had short, brown hair that was spiked on top and big, blue eyes. At first Jon didn’t recognize him, but when he got up it dawned on him that the teenager was in fact Peter Karlowski. <br />
<br />
“How did you get here?” Jon asked him as he stood up. Peter just grinned and said “I flew here. Boy there’s a big storm heading this way! For a moment, I was completely drenched! And I got into the dorm without being seen, so don’t worry. You can’t see a kid when he’s invisible, you know!” he answered, with a smile on his face. “I decided to take you up on your invitation. So here I am, and I’m going to let you grow some more muscle on your body, just like you requested.” Jon stood there for a moment, looking at his unusual visitor. Then he offered Peter something to drink. While he prepared a glass of soda with ice, the curious teenager strolled around the dorm room, looking at Jon’s posters, TV, cd’s, his stereo, and his computer. “Wow, so this is what it’s like to be a college student, huh? I still got three years of high school to go through before I can live on campus like this. I like your place, Jon!” Jon sat down on the couch as he watched his visitor walk around his dorm. He noted that Peter had a good sense for detail, as the teen walked and observed everything he had in his dorm. <br />
“I think we can go to the gym now” he said, while Jon started to feel a growing desire to work out as well. Without thinking, Jon opened the door and let Peter out. Then he led Peter down the stairs to the main entrance. When they got there, one of the students behind the counter by the door said something to Jon. “Hey Jon, who’s that kid? He didn’t sign in the guestbook!” the student remarked. “Yes, I did sign in!” Peter said, looking the student in the eyes. “You did sign in” the student repeated, as he looked down and saw Peter’s name appear in the guestbook. “Now you will let me pass” Peter ordered the student, who responded “Yes, I will let you pass”. Jon wondered what had happened, for the student seemed as if he was hypnotized, obeying Peter’s every word. <br />
<br />
Then they finally made it out the dorm, but it was pouring rain, and Jon had no umbrella with him. Still, Peter kept himself and Jon shielded from the rain, as they walked on the sidewalk without even getting wet. The raindrops didn’t touch them, and Jon led Peter to the building where the gym was located. When the walked in, Jon swiped his student id card through a card reader located on a counter near the entrance to the gym. Peter walked behind him, but was stopped by another student. “Hey kid, you can’t come in here…” But suddenly the student’s eyes widened as he had a very surprised look on his face. “Hey kid, you look familiar. I think I saw you on TV a few weeks ago! You’re the kid who could change people into animals and make them disappear, right?” Peter just smiled at him for a few seconds. “I can’t stop you from going in” the student said calmly, allowing Peter to follow Jon through the hallway and up the stairs where they ended up in the weight room.<br />
<br />
Jon started out his workout with the bench press. He was able to lift 245 pounds as his maximum, but while Peter was sitting on the bench right next to him, he felt his muscles grow and his strength increase. His arms were growing thicker while his shoulders were getting wider. After a dozen reps, he loaded an additional 30 pounds on the bar and was able to lift it six times. <br />
<br />
After that, he tried the leg extension. He loaded 180 pounds on it and completed a dozen reps with relative ease. His legs swelled up… and became 3 inches thicker than they were at first. Then he added twenty pounds more, he struggled, but was still able to lift the weight with his legs. But when he tried 220 pounds, he could only do four reps before he had to stop. <br />
<br />
He decided to try the bench press once more, starting out with the weight he ended with last time, and he was now able to lift 275 pounds. Peter was still there with him, and he felt his strength gradually increasing while the boy was sitting there with him. He had gotten stronger over just a few minutes, but Jon had no idea how big he had become. He did notice his shirt fitting even tighter than before, and wondered if and when it would rip. <br />
<br />
While walking to the leg extension machine, Paul walked by. “Good grief, Jon! You’re a monster! Keep up the muscle growth, dude!” Paul said. Jon just smiled at him and said “Hey Paul, check this out!” as he flexed his right arm, making the bicep pop up like a bowling ball. “Wow! Look at that gun!” And Paul was astonished at Jon’s biceps!<br />
When Jon tried the leg extension again, he completed a dozen reps with 220 pounds of weight! He had never lifted that much before! He loved it, knowing that he was slowly getting bigger and stronger, although he had no idea how much bigger he looked. He added another twenty pounds to the weights and ended lifting 240 pounds four times before reaching muscular failure. His legs had gained another 3 inches, and he felt that he could not keep them too close together anymore. He looked up at Peter, and noticed how the teen was obviously pleased with his progress, by the big smile that showed on his face.<br />
<br />
Jon started to feel his t-shirt getting tighter and tighter on his chest and wondered how much longer it would hold out until it would rip under the increased size and bulk of his growing pectoral muscles. He then decided to try the bench one more time, and to see how much he could grow that day. <br />
<br />
He added another 25 pounds to the bar; making it an even 300 pounds of weight he had to lift. He got on his back and used his legs to push his body far enough so that he was now looking up at the bar, while it rested on the stand behind his head. He had never lifted that much weight before, but he knew that the boy was sitting besides him and was watching him. As long as Peter was there, he would feel his muscles grow. He made his first attempt to lift the bar and was very pleased with his success. It just couldn’t get any better that this; he was finally able to lift 300 pounds. His pectorals swelled even larger, pushing the shirt to the limit. And his shoulders grew even rounder and wider than before.<br />
<br />
Then the funny thing happened, after Jon got up, he flexed his muscles while standing in front of the huge mirror, and the shirt ripped in half, straight down the middle. He took the remains of the shirt off and tossed it in the trash bin. He then stood there, being utterly amazed by his rapid muscular growth. He was afraid that people might suspect he was using chemicals to stimulate his unusually rapid growth, but he was happy knowing that it was not the case and that there was no way someone could prove otherwise. He stared at himself in the mirror and was pleased with the results.<br />
<br />
Right at that moment, Richard walked right by him as he was standing in front of the mirror. Richard was one of the dance instructors in the gym and he was completely stunned by Jon’s rapid growth. “Wow, Jon! You blew right out of that t-shirt! My goodness, I hope it wasn’t a new shirt! You may as well toss that in the garbage, big guy!” he said, as he bent down to pick up the remains of the shirt that had fallen off my body right after it had ripped. “Good grief, if you keep this up, then pretty soon you won’t even make it through the door!” he continued, completely amazed at seeing Jon’s huge muscles!<br />
<br />
He wanted to take a shower so he instructed Peter to hang around the gym while he went to the locker room in order to change and to take his shower. While Jon was busy taking off his clothes in the locker room, his friend Chris walked in. He looked over and noticed Jon’s growth. “You look pretty buff there, Jon! I guess you must have been working out a lot huh?” he said. “Yeah, my recent workouts have been grueling! But I can feel that my muscles have been growing, almost like… magic!” Jon responded. Both men chuckled, as the entered the shower room.<br />
<br />
When Jon got out of the shower, dried off and got dressed, he saw to his amazement that his t-shirt no longer fit him anymore. So he asked Chris for one of his shirts, and ended up borrowing a shirt from his buddy. As he put the shirt on, it fit tightly around his chest and arms. When he thanked Chris his arms bulged and pushed the sleeves up making them tighter. He also had to borrow a pair of shorts, which fit nice and snug around his muscular bubble butt. It was now high time to buy new clothes, for he couldn’t fit into any of his clothes anymore!<br />
<br />
While walking out of the locker room, Justin was walking right by him, when he stopped and noticed something about Jon. “Holy smoke, Jon! Have you grown so much?” he said to Jon. “Yes, you noticed it, too?” Jon responded. “Wow, Jon, you look so much bigger than you were last time I saw you in here, which really wasn’t that long ago! Well all I can say is, you look great! Keep up the awesome workouts!” “Thanks!” Jon replied, just loving the string of compliments he was receiving from his friends in the gym.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Peter was walking through the cardiovascular section of the gym. People were pedaling bikes and running or walking on the treadmills. There were several stair climbing machines as well. Peter got on the stationary bike and started pedaling. At first, the bike seemed really hard and stiff. He couldn’t pedal much, no matter how hard he tried. Then he read the instructions and realized he had to set some program for a course to bike on. Of course this was all done electronically by computer. The resistance would be increased or decreased, depending on the level of difficulty the biker would choose on the control panel in front of the bike. A keypad was attached to the bike, in between the handle bars. When Peter pressed a Start button on the keypad, he was able to pedal with ease. His bike was positioned right next to a treadmill machine, which was unused until a young lady walked up to it and hopped onto the treadmill. <br />
<br />
Peter looked over and saw the female college student. She was not very tall; in fact, Peter noticed that he was probably taller than her. She set the controls on the treadmill and slowly started walking. She gradually increased her speed and pace on the treadmill until it seemed like she was going at top speed. Peter thought she looked nice and he smiled back at her, secretly increasing her muscles. She was constantly looking at her odometer and noticed that she was not feeling as tired as she usually would, going at this pace for the same amount of time. In fact, she realized that she was able to run faster and longer! She started to wonder if she had in fact gotten stronger. Of course, Peter was fully enjoying the fact that this young student had become stronger because of him, and he was reading her mind. He picked up on her thoughts and wondered whether or not he should have revealed to her what he was doing to her body. But Peter was also very shy, and he felt afraid to say anything. Although she was probably 18 or 19 years old, she probably would have considered Peter to be too young. But as Peter was pondering what to do next, he decided to make her act first. He went inside of her mind, he found out who she was and everything else about her, and then he quietly made her notice him and like him. <br />
“Hey kid, you’re kinda cute!” she said, as she started to slow down a bit on the treadmill. Peter already knew that her name was Lisa, and he just grinned at her, whispering “Thanks, Lisa”. The young lady wondered how he knew her name, but lost the desire to ask him. He looked back at her several times, and she felt a warm feeling inside of her. <br />
<br />
Peter chuckled at the thought that he could have made her fall in love with him, but he didn’t want to cause a scene or make Lisa feel bad. He could have made her do whatever he wanted, but he didn’t want to scare her or make her aware of the fact that he was in control of her mind and her body. He wanted to see how fast she could go, and he went inside of her and made her run at top speed for a minute! She ran as hard as she could, forcing the treadmill to make a loud zooming noise! Then he realized that she was getting tired and started to sweat. She wanted to stop, as she was breathing with her mouth open.  Somehow her body didn’t obey her, and Peter let her run a few seconds longer. Then he allowed her to slow down, because he was afraid she was going to collapse.<br />
<br />
When Peter got tired of pedaling he slowed down until he eventually stopped. Lisa suddenly had enough as well, as she slowed down until the treadmill came to a complete stop. She grabbed her towel and walked up to Peter, who was still sitting on the bike. “I have never gone this far and this fast before!” she said to him. She grabbed her towel and wiped the sweat off Peter’s face with it. “I’m feeling really tired” she said to him. Peter looked at her. She wore black spandex and a black top, and she had tennis shoes. Peter liked her legs, but he didn’t dare to say anything. “Hey guy, thanks for keeping me company while I worked out, okay? I think you’re very cute, you know!” she said. And Peter started to blush, he couldn’t help turning red as a tomato! But he thought it was cool that the girl liked him, even though Peter had cheated and forced her to like him. She blew a kiss with her hand at Peter, turned around and walked towards the exit. That made Peter’s day!<br />
<br />
Jon finally made it out of the locker room. Just when he turned around the corner, he bumped into another friend of his, “big” Jake. It used to be that Jon would fall on the floor whenever he would bump in to him, because Jake was really big and buff. Jake had a 50” chest with 22” biceps and he was a 7’0” mountain with 390 pounds of solid muscle. But now that Jon had gotten a lot more muscular and stronger, this did not happen. Jon was now about 330 pounds and growing, especially since Peter was here. He was now about 6.0’ tall. Jake almost lost his balance and pressed his hand against the wall in order to stop himself from falling! Jon thought it was funny, and he grabbed hold of Jake’s arm. <br />
<br />
“Hey Jon, is that you?” Jake asked his, with an incredible look of surprise on his face. “You have gotten so huge! How is that possible? Is anyone or anything helping you grow like that?” he asked Jon. But Jon thought that Jake would never believe him, but he just answered jokingly “It’s though magic, Jake!” Both men chuckled at that remark, and Jon continued walking into the gym while Jake stared at him. Jon just loved the attention he was getting, for he was now getting noticed by more people, even the big guys!<br />
<br />
Thinking of magic, Jon decided to walk around the gym in order to find the teenage wizard who had caused his muscular growth in the first place. He eventually spotted Peter, sitting on a bike near the entrance to the gym. He had his eyes closed and looked like he was in deep thought, resting his chin on the palm of his hand, while pressing his elbows on the handlebars when Jon quietly walked up to the boy. “Peter!” he whispered, as the boy’s eyes suddenly opened with a shock. “Didn’t mean to scare you, buddy!” Jon responded, realizing that he had startled the boy. “Are you alright?” he asked the teen, who seemed a little dazed for a minute. “Oh yeah, I was just thinking about a girl I had met, that’s all!” Jon looked at him with a little bit of surprise. “Peter, you’re still a teenager, these are college students and they are all older than you! You’re just a few years too young for them.” Jon responded. “Don’t think about it now, your time will come! Come on; let’s go to the student union to grab something to eat. I still need to buy new clothes. You’re welcome to come with me, if you want. Or do you need to leave to go back home tonight?” Jon asked him, realizing that Peter was relatively far from home.<br />
<br />
Then Jon realized that it was getting late already and he didn’t feel good about letting a teenager travel hundreds of miles on his own at night and in bad weather, no matter how strong and powerful he was. Besides, Peter started to get sleepy, and he didn’t want to force Peter to travel when he was feeling tired. After all, Peter had come to help him, and he saw it very appropriate to allow him to spend the night in his dorm. “Peter, I want to offer you to spend the night in my dorm, okay? The couch unfolds as a hide-away bed, so you are more than welcome to spend the night. You’ll feel like you’re a college student for a day. I don’t feel good about you being out on the road out at night and all alone. Do you need to let your folks know where you are?” Jon asked the teenager while they were walking to the student union, where all the restaurants were located. I’m still on summer break and my parents know that I can be anywhere, I just need to let them know where I am right now and when I plan to come home.” Jon was happy to have Peter over. “You can call or email them from my dorm, if you want! Do your parents know about your magic powers? Are they able to do the same things as you?” Jon asked the boy out of curiosity. “No,” Peter replied, “I’m the only one in the family with these powers, although my parents and my friends all know that I have them” he replied calmly.<br />
<br />
When Jon and Peter walked into the student union, they were met by three of Jon’s friends: Randy, Richard, and Joshua. “Wow, Jon! You look like a real muscle jock! How did you get so big, so fast?” Joshua asked him. “Hard work, luck, determination, and… a little bit of magic!” Jon responded cheerfully, while all three of his friends thought it was a joke. “And who is the kid?” Richard asked, looking down at Peter. “Peter is… my little bro! He’s here from out of town, spending the day with me here on campus!” The five of them ordered some dinner in the cafeteria, where they talked about working out, buying clothes, and how much Jon had grown. Peter had a place to stay, and he was having a great time with Jon. And he wondered what they were going to do the following day, since Jon was in serious need to buy new clothes for his new, muscular body!</p>
