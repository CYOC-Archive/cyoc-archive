<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: I accidentally did ch.3&#39;s title twice so this should fix it. Also, this chapter going to be longer. There may or may not be an epilogue too.)   <br />
<br />
As the clouds parted to reveal more of the moonlight Bella watched the pink flesh surge suddenly. The girl fell off the log in shock and tried to scute away from the growing member. She then felt something shift inside herself and the organ leaked out some pre-cum. She let out a groan as it began to get painfully tight. She cried out in pain as something pushed against the fabric just below. Looking around she called out for help as it got worse.  <br />
<br />
Eventually, relief came to her as her zipper broke followed by the button. Her dick was now pushing her panties forward and her balls now hung out the leg holes. The latter was hurting due to how taunt it was. She let out a sigh as her panties snapped off and joined her pants. Seeing her foot-long cock still growing she let out a scream as she ran through the woods. With every step her balls swayed. The testosterone inside them made her increasingly horny. She saw it looked more canine with bulging veins down its length. A knot the size of one of her balls grew in front of a developing sheath.  <br />
<br />
She skidded to a stop when she realized she had made one big circle. Holding back tears she found herself at the log again. She sat down as the two-foot member begged her to touch it. Her willpower to ignore it was slipping as was her hope of finding a way out. &#39;well now we can&#39;t have that&#39; a male voice said. Bella&#39;s eyes darted left and right as the voice continued. &#39;a child of the moon always knows how to navigate the forest.&#39; it said again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Bella asked. &#39;look up Bella&#39; he said. Following his direction she did so. If having a cock wasn&#39;t the strangest thing she&#39;d ever seen then this would take the cake. Between her and the moon was a translucent anthro wolf. Only his cock looked more translucent than the rest of him. &quot;what&#39;s going on&quot; Bella asked convinced you&#39;re not dreaming. The wolf man chuckled as he spoke. His lips never moved but she heard every word. &#39;No dream would feel this real nor a nightmare. Also, don&#39;t bother pinching yourself&#39; he said. &quot;how did you...&quot; Bella was confused about who this creature was. &#39;well our souls began merging the second the magic hit you and your friends. Of course only when the moon was out could I make myself known.&#39; he said.  <br />
<br />
She realized it wasn&#39;t speaking to her but she heard his thoughts. &#39;that&#39;s right young one, or rather soon us. No this can&#39;t be reversed. Yes, I&#39;m sure. Oops sorry,&#39; he was replying to her before she could even form a word. &quot;okay do you know how this happened&quot; Bella looked down to see her cock was now over three feet but thankfully it finally stopped. White fur now covered the sheath. &#39;no, but whatever pulled me from limbo was strong and unstable. So long as it remains it can be hazardous to the person it gets infused with&#39;. He scratched his neck as he &#39;said&#39; &#39;while there may never be a way to reverse this there is a way to speed it up&#39;. He stroked the air in front of his now vacant crotch. Bella could feel her balls churning and soon came across the grass. Her once-trimmed bush became a thick forest of white fur as shorter white fur surrounded it.  <br />
<br />
&#39;I know you&#39;re scared but if you want to be safe again we need to change. Believe me, if I had any choice I would&#39;ve picked Brent to merge with.&#39; he thought. Bella looked at the werewolf&#39;s crotch and saw his fur was disappearing as the white fur spread across her. Deep within her this feeling that he was telling the truth became more apparent. With a nod, she touched her dick. Like a dam bursting she began to rub it due to her hands not being big enough.  <br />
<br />
The white fur soon spread across her balls with a thick line of it going between her nuts and up to her changing anus. Her thighs then began to thicken considerably with visible veins pumping testosterone through them. Once the white fur spread past her knees her calves also became extremely muscular. The wolf felt glee as he could feel the wind brush against their legs. His feet began to disappear as Bella&#39;s ankles rose. Her shoes and socks burst apart as pads appeared on her growing paws. Both let out a laugh as the grass tickled their feet. One by one the wolf&#39;s white claws vanished as Bella&#39;s paws gained them.  <br />
<br />
More cum came out of their cock as her tailbone extended. As it grew fluffy white fur covered its four feet of flesh. Bella opened her eyes to see the wolf now had no lower half. In addition, he seemed to be closer the more he disappeared. Soon the changes spread up her torso. Her modest hourglass body soon filled out into a muscular v shape. Abs popped into existence followed quickly by short white fur. Thicker white fur soon made a treasure trail up to her shrinking breasts. On her left side, five gray marks appeared.  <br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;re getting my body. That attack centuries ago is what made me like this&#39; he thought. From behind her shrinking breasts, massive pecs formed. Short fur soon covered part of it leaving only his nipples uncovered. They shifted in shape and lost their sensitivity and future function. From his chest, more thick fur grew and spread up across his shoulders and upper back.  <br />
<br />
His biceps and triceps bulged out to match the wolves. Thick fur hung off his elbows and forearms as half gained short fur. The wolf&#39;s hands moved to where his crotch once was as he now felt Bella&#39;s hand grow into his. Their shared hand was now large enough to jack off one-handed. He closed his eyes as his pads and claws grew on their large meaty hands.  <br />
<br />
Around Bella&#39;s thickening neck, the fur grew into a large main like a lion. They let out a growl as their head began to change. Their voice deepened as they began to see through their former self. The moon seemed to unlock the wolf&#39;s memories and merge his two minds. His spirit mind revealed he was once a farmer named Issac Miller. His ears rose his head and became pointed as more memories came flooding in. Issac had been ridding down a forested road when a howl startled him off his horse. The beast ran off leaving Issac with a broken leg. It was their Issac saw a black humanoid wolf walk towards him. &#39;not much for a hunt yet allow us to see how good thou are at mating&#39; she said. White fur then covered his ears with the tips getting black triangular markings. Issac tried to run but received a deep gash across his left side. &#39;do not try to &#39;scape or else thy life shall be over  &#39;i  a blink of an eye&#39; she said. The short fur covered his scalp as his hair merged with his main.  <br />
<br />
He remembered Issac changing into his werewolf form and being forced to mate with the wolf. Of course, once he was changed he asked why him. &#39;thou couldn&#39;t run so no hunting. And yet I&#39;ve made several good males from creatures like thou, and I shall doth so again&#39; After she said this he realized more innocent people would have this forced on them. Before she could react he lunged at her and ended her life. He had looked in horror at the blood on his hands. For the next hundred years, he used his curse to heal the gravely injured or terminally ill. However each time he gave them the talk about the cost. Soon he had gained a pack that revealed another in size. Issac and another alpha waged war against how werewolves should use their gifts. Sadly by the end, both sides were mortally wounded and perished.  <br />
<br />
A tear formed out of his red eyes as his muzzle finished growing. Fangs filled it as his nose became large, black, and wet. Black fur covered his muzzle as the 7&#39;8 werewolf gave one final howl into the night sky. Isla felt reborn in more ways than one. He looked at the log he sat on and gave a swift kick. It was launched far across the clearing. While his Bella side was once scared his Issac side helped balance them out.  <br />
<br />
Sniffing the air he turned to see a werewolf herm come from the forest. &quot;hello there big guy&quot; they said. Now that they were closer he could smell their friend Alice within them. Bella and Alice had always been great friends but Isla found her female form and cock extremely hot. Given how he had been both a male and female merged into a male werewolf he guessed it made sense. &quot;the name&#39;s Isla but you can call me alpha. Unless of course, you want to battle for that title?&quot; he got his answer when they knelled and grabbed his dick. &quot;no need alpha&quot; They then began sucking him off.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Isla opened his eyes to see sunlight. He slowly got up and recalled all the information from last night. Sniffing the air he found which direction Alice had gone in. He soon came across the pond and saw his reflection. Any signs of Bella were gone and yet he didn&#39;t look like Issac. He looked as if Bella had been born a man mixed with Issac.  <br />
<br />
His body was incredibly jacked at 6&#39;4. His hair was blond. His body hair was still there on everything below his neck but looked more human, he also had a 5 o&#39;clock shadow across his face. His nails and teeth were a little sharper but not too noticeable. The biggest change was of course his six-inch flaccid cock and large balls. Soon he shared some rustling and saw a human herm passing him unknowingly.  <br />
<br />
He walked up behind her and said &quot;So you&#39;ve come back for more?&quot; Isla said. Alice gasped at seeing him. &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked. Realizing she didn&#39;t recognize his scent he let out a chuckle. &quot;I guess you still haven&#39;t figured it out. So I&#39;ll tell you now. My name was once Bella,&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
He let the shock come to her face before speaking. He explained both about Issac and what happened in the clearing. Alice didn&#39;t remember last night which isn&#39;t uncommon for new werewolves, especially ones transformed by magic rather than infected by another werewolf. &quot;Come on&quot; he took her hand. &quot;But we need to get back,&quot; Alice said. &quot;Of course but first we need to be modest,&quot; Isla said as they came back to the clearing.  <br />
<br />
He picked up his broken pants and ripped shirt. He tore the legs of his jeans and tied them around Alice&#39;s waist. He then picked up his ruined shirt and turned it into a bra for her. After giving these to Alice he went to the remaining part of his broken pants and turned them into a loincloth. &quot;these may not be pretty but they&#39;ll do until we get to the hospital&quot; Isla said as he walked past Alice. Turning his head he motioned her to follow him.  <br />
<br />
He walked slowly to match Alice&#39;s pace. His Issac side had seen this a few times, mostly in victims of the other pack. he suddenly stopped and turned to her scaring the girl a bit. &quot;what is it&quot; she asked. &quot;You&#39;re denying what has happened to you right?&quot; he got a nod in response. He closed his eyes and sighed. &quot;denial only makes the connection between you and your inner beast unstable. It is why you have no memories of last night. I fear that if you keep this up you&#39;ll lose control and hurt those you care about&quot; he opened his eyes and took her hands.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know I can&#39;t do anything to make you but I can show you how to control this. However, if you wish to go on this path I can&#39;t stop you&quot; Isla let go and began walking. He then heard Alice call his name. &quot;ISLA wait!&quot; she ran up to him. &quot;the last thing I want is to hurt people. Please help me,&quot; she tearfully. &quot;well start tonight. After that we&#39;ll only have tomorrow before we have to wait another month.&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
Once they were by the bathrooms Isla got out Bella&#39;s phone. He then entered a number and put the phone to his ear. &quot;yes hello. Me and my... friend have been affected by the storm. We woke up a bit ago in the park. Please send someone&quot; he then hung up. As they waited Isla noticed Alice squirming. He could smell her arousal and realized that the female scents were arousing her cock while the male ones were making her pussy ache. &quot;Don&#39;t squirm. Instead, breathe in and out. Let your enhanced senses get used to the scents&quot; Alice followed his directions and he noticed her bulge die down. Just in time too as ambulances arrived.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After they were loaded up and heading to the hospital, Isla began to wonder. In his mind, he had no doubt a spell had caused the storms to appear. Was this intentional or an accident? Once they arrived they found themselves in a room together. A nurse told them that people affected by the storm had been arriving here a lot more since yesterday.  <br />
<br />
A few tests later the doctor returned with the results. &quot;while you both not exhibiting any airborne pathogens your blood, saliva, and claws show an unknown virus&quot; the woman said. &quot;you should also put down reproductive juices&quot; Isla said. The doctor looked confused. &quot;I&#39;m serious. We&#39;re werewolves now.&quot; he then summarized what happened to him both now and Isaac&#39;s life in England. Some time after the doctor left the nurse informed them they had visitors.  <br />
<br />
As they entered Isla could smell who they were beneath their new forms. The four-foot vixen was Brent. There was no mistaking the dragon anthro, that was his friend Gwyn. Tyler had become a herm centaur, if it wasn&#39;t for her cock he would&#39;ve thought of a centuaress. Of course, she was too long to enter and only her front was in the room. Joy had become a male griffin as tall as Gwyn. The pink anthro unicorn herm was Bella&#39;s brother. Wendy&#39;s face was unchanged so he didn&#39;t even need his nose to know the Minotaur herm. By default, the green punk rat had to be Cody.  <br />
<br />
&quot;so who&#39;s Bella and who&#39;s Alice?&quot; Jay said. He was getting a little uncomfortable on two legs so he sat down on all fours. &quot;well Alice is over there and I was Bella but you can call me Isla now. Did any of you have name changes as well?&quot; Isla asked. &quot;Wynn,&quot; his unicorn sibling said as he hugged Isla. &quot;Jay&quot; the griffin gave a hand wave. &quot;honestly I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever change my name. It&#39;s all I have&quot; Cody whispered that last part. Isla could smell magic on him and figured out what it meant. &#39;Briar&#39; the vixen typed on the laptop Gwyn brought in. &quot;like I&#39;m Tory now&quot; even Tyler&#39;s attitude had changed. &quot;apparently I used to be Wendy but you can call me Wyatt&quot; the Minotaur said.  <br />
<br />
After that, they talked for a while. Cody told his story about punk fever. Briar explained the reason behind her increased intellect. Alice explained what she found last night. Wyatt explained how her memories were altered so she will need help. Jay told him he loved his new body and wished people would stop bugging him about it. Isla agreed as one must be accepting of what has happened. Wynn showed off his magic by making stuff float. Gwyn had hugged Alice saying he was worried when he saw her room. Tory gave her... let&#39;s call it a story about how she beat down a dangerous creature. Once they left the doctor came in and told them they needed to stay overnight so they could analyze the virus. Isla was more than happy. This present was more accepting of him than Issac&#39;s ever was.  he just hoped someone could deal with the storms. Else this world would never be the same.</p>
