<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And so I began my new life as Ty's plaything. Almost every day, he'd change me into something different to humiliate me and pleasure himself.<br />
<br />
The day after he turned me into a human pet, I awoke to find myself about 8 or 10 years old, I guessed. I was really short, skinny, and all-<br />
around young-looking. My head barely reached over the bathroom sink and my penis was positively pre-pubescent. However, after being a <br />
dog-like boy and a baby, I was happy to be just a normal boy. I was even wearing pajamas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready to go to school today?&quot; Ty asked me when I went down for breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; I said in my little boy voice. &quot;What am I? In second grade now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, you're still 16!&quot; Ty said with a laugh. &quot;I changed reality so that you stopped growing when you turned 8. Now you get to find out what <br />
it's like to be a super late-bloomer high schooler!&quot;<br />
<br />
Crap. I knew there was a catch.<br />
<br />
I quickly ate a bowl of cereal (Ty had to get the bowl from the cupboard for me and I tried to ignore how my feet didn't reach the floor when I <br />
sat down), then I ran upstairs and got dressed. It appeared in this new reality Ty has created, that I tried hard to dress like a normal 16-year-<br />
old, but still had to shop in the kids section. Despite my best efforts, I really couldn't change the fact that I looked like an 8-year-old. I sighed <br />
and heaved my backpack on, which seemed to be as big as I was now, and headed out toward the bus stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at cute little Dustin trying to act so grown up!&quot; Ty called as he followed me. &quot;Tell you what, I'm going to follow you all day and no one will <br />
be able to see or hear me. How's that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; I said, trying to make my voice sound deeper.<br />
<br />
While we waited for the bus, Ty explained to me how I lost most of my friends when they hit puberty and I didn't. As they shot up to 5 and 6 <br />
feet tall, it became really awkward for them to hang out with a little 4-foot-tall twerp like me. I refused to make eye contact with Ty while he <br />
told me this — it was just still too weird to have to look up at him. It was also really weird and horrifying to know that he could change <br />
anything with a simple thought. I still couldn't believe that he had turned my parents into infants and just wished them away. I kept wishing <br />
that this was all some sort of bad dream, but I knew it wasn't.<br />
<br />
Finally the bus came. I had to practically jump up the steps and hoist myself up onto a seat. A few kids on the bus snickered quietly when they <br />
saw me struggling with my enormous backpack, but most everybody else tried to avoid eye contact with me. A few days ago, these people were <br />
my friends. They looked up to me and wanted to hang out with me. Now I was small and awkward and no one could relate to me. Of course, Ty <br />
was enjoying the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Walking through the halls was insane. I now only came up to the waists of my fellow classmates, so I had to squeeze my way through a forest <br />
of butts and crotches to get to my first class of the day, math.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you lost little guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked up to see a substitute teacher bending over me, obviously unaware that a high school student could look so young.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm in high school, and this is my class,&quot; I said, trying to appear as mature as my little body would allow.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, what an active imagination you have,&quot; the stupid sub said. &quot;But I think you need to go back to your elementary school across the street. I <br />
need to start this Pre-Calculus class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I really am 16!&quot; I said. I glanced at my classmates for support, but they couldn't stop giggling at my predicament. I was positive that Ty <br />
was causing all this to happen, but there was nothing I could do about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I've had enough of this game,&quot; the sub said, beginning to lose patience. &quot;If you don't leave right now, I'm going to escort you to the <br />
principal's office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't understand!&quot; I objected. &quot;I'm where I'm supposed to be! I am 16! I am in high school!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it! Come with me, young man!&quot; the sub shouted. She then grabbed my wrist and pulled me down to the principal's office. I couldn't <br />
believe how weak I was — no matter how hard I struggled, I could not break from her grasp.<br />
<br />
Luckily the principal was able to sort everything out, and the sub was incredibly embarrassed, but not as much as I was. For the rest of the day, <br />
I had to endure countless taunts and teases from my old friends, asking me if I was lost, bending down and talking in baby voice to offer to <br />
take me to elementary school. Because my classmates grew up with me and knew I was really 16, they generally tried to keep this kind of <br />
teasing down to a minimum. But when someone opens the gate, like the sub did, there's no holding back. I just tried to go about my day like <br />
normal and not giving Ty the satisfaction of seeing me have an emotional outburst. Finally the last class of the day came — the one I was most <br />
dreading — gym.<br />
<br />
Last week, I was tall, strong, and athletic. I loved gym and I had nothing to be ashamed of with my body. But now ...<br />
<br />
I had to stand on a bench to reach my locker and tried to do my best to hide my skinny and hairless body from the giants who used to be <br />
smaller than me. My gym uniform was in the smallest size, but it draped over me like a circus tent. I had manipulated the clothes with a <br />
complicated series of twists and rolls to get them to stay on my body, but I still looked like a drowned rat. And because word had gotten out <br />
about my incident with the substitute, I had endure more jokes like, &quot;Don't worry, I'm sure you'll grow into it once you finish elementary <br />
school,&quot; all while Ty watched and laughed silently from behind me.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I found out today was the beginning of our weight lifting unit, something I had been looking forward to for weeks. Now instead of me <br />
being able to show off my incredible physique, I had to endure one more activity that pointed out how small and puny I am. We were divided <br />
into groups based on our size, and I was put in a group of the smallest girls in the class. While most people laughed, these girls were nice to <br />
me, but more like in a big sister way. I couldn't really blame them, though, each of them was more than a full head taller than me.<br />
<br />
Our first task was to see how much we could bench press. My team was using the special girls bar that only weighed 25 pounds, and for me, <br />
we decided to start it with no weight on it. My spotters had to hand the bar down to me, and before they even let go, my twig arms began to <br />
shake more than I've ever seen them shake. The spotters slowly let go of the bar, and I began to sweat and strain as if I were holding 500 <br />
pounds, but I was determined to lift this bar. I couldn't let Ty win. But as soon as the spotters fully let go of the bar, it came crashing down on <br />
the safety bars. I screamed and everybody burst up laughing and someone yelled out, &quot;Coach, why are you making a second grader do a high <br />
schooler's workout?&quot; The coach apologized and told me he'd make some special exercises for me the next day, and I went to hide in the locker <br />
room. Today had been too much for me and I couldn't stop the tears from flowing. <br />
<br />
But waiting for me in the locker room was Ty with a huge grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you're starting to understand how I felt,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; I yelled, losing all control. &quot;You weren't ever this small in high school! I may have been a jerk to you, but this is completely unfair and you <br />
know it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought for a moment. &quot;You might be right,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;But I really don't care, anymore. I'm just having so much fun with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you!&quot; I screamed, and I ran up to him and began beating his chest with my tiny fists. I was so weak, it felt like I was moving in water, and <br />
I knew I couldn't possibly hurt him, but my emotions wouldn't let me sit still.<br />
<br />
Ty laughed and laughed, then brushed me aside like a mosquito. &quot;You know, this gives me an idea,&quot; he said. &quot;Your head is at just the right level <br />
...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; I asked, not wanting to know the answer.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, three of the biggest guys in the school came into the locker room, wondering aloud if the little prick could fit one of their cocks in <br />
his mouth. I knew they were talking about me, and I tried to run, but gigantic hands quickly grabbed me, undressed me, and forced me into the <br />
showers, where I found out that my head was at just the right level to suck on my old friend's dick.</p>
