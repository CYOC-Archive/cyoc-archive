<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;SO THIS IS MY ROOM&quot; Jess tells you, bringing you in. It&#39;s not very large, and pretty straightforward. The only features are a wardrobe on one side, a bed in the corner, and a nightstand beside it. The nightstand&#39;s second-highest drawer is slightly open, which both of you notice at the same time, just enough to show a glimpse of some ladies&#39; underwear and, in the corner, part of a large, purple, vaguely cylindrical object in a clear plastic box. Both of you flush with embarrassment, and you immediately look away as she darts over to close it.<br />
<br />
One awkward moment later, you start talking for a bit about the various options you might have for getting at the gun without risking any more mishaps like this one, and then you both go to sleep. For safety and convenience, you&#39;re put in the top drawer of the nightstand, where she keeps some t-shirts. She leaves it open just a crack so you get plenty of airflow and you can leave if you feel like you have to, and you settle down and try to get some rest.<br />
<br />
You wake up some time later that night in the dark, with a loud rumbling noise reverberating from below you. Through the crack in the drawer above you, you can make out part of a silhouette against the darkness. Looks like part of a girl in a bathrobe, leaning down a bit and closing the drawer below you. &quot;Hey, Jess?&quot; You call out blearily, your mid sluggish from the sudden awakening. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shape pauses, then the drawer you&#39;re in is swiftly (but carefully) pulled open to reveal that there is, in fact, a shadowy female figure standing over you. It reaches a hand down, and you suddenly realize what&#39;s going on as you catch a little light fall over a pair of playful, smiling, mischievous bright green eyes. You open your mouth to call out as Pam grabs hold of you, but she picks you up and clutches your body against her breast with incredible speed, so your already-pitiful little screams are dissipated into nothingness against the silk of her robe.<br />
<br />
Her mission accomplished, Pam grins with satisfaction, and takes a small vial of liquid out from one of her pockets. She turns just enough so you can barely get a look at what&#39;s going on, from time to time, as she spends a couple of minutes carefully applying drops and splashes of it around the drawer, fussing with the arrangement of the clothes inside at times. Then she slides the drawer back in to its original position, spreads a little bit at carefully-selected points on the lid, and then places a few drops and some smears at increasingly-sparse intervals to a point across the room, by the side of the dresser. Lastly, she scratches very lightly at a couple of points on the nightstand, taking care to keep very still and quiet, and then puts everything up and tiptoes out of the room.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t see a whole lot around her silk-covered breast, (though it is a little on the smallish size, by normal-people standards) as she&#39;s traveling, but what you can see around the edges of your vision it looks like she&#39;s taking you down a hallway, and into a bedroom. Unlike Jess&#39;s, this one still has the lights on, and you can see that the walls have been painted a deep pink sort of color. She finally pulls you away from her chest and holds you out in front of her, letting you get a good look at everything, as she puts some things away in what turns out to be a desk drawer.<br />
<br />
Also unlike Jess&#39;s room, this one, while technically still the same size and shape as hers, had an incredibly crowded look to it. The first thing you notice is that the walls are covered with paintings of various sizes; portraits, still lifes, trippy color patterns, you name it. All kinds of scenes are depicted, from gruesome battlefields to calm smiles and sunsets, and you have to admit that they&#39;re really well done. Much of the room is taken up by a queen-sized bed in the middle, covered in flowery bedsheets, and Pam&#39;s holding you in her fist standing just between that and a large, sprawling, antique-looking oaken writing desk. A single chair in the corner stands in front of a palette and portrait stand. What space is left is taken up by a couple of wardrobes, with random drawers hanging open to a greater or lesser degree, and various discarded articles of clothing strewn about randomly.<br />
<br />
&quot;WELCOME HOME, SHORT STUFF&quot; Pam grins down at you, seeing you looking around. &quot;THIS IS WHERE YOU&#39;RE GONNA BE STAYING FROM NOW ON, SO I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.&quot; You notice for the first time that she&#39;s not wearing anything underneath that robe, which is practically transparent and holds her tall, slender frame tightly, which is basically irrelevant since she just lets it fall open in the front anyway, revealing a neatly-trimmed brown bush and a pair of small, but perky-looking breasts. Although skinny, she has a really nice frame, and you have to admit you find the overall effect to be quite pretty. Then you realize you&#39;re staring, look up, and flush with embarrassment to see her smirking at you knowingly. Yup. She&#39;s totally noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOT MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN, HUH?&quot; She mocks you. &quot;WELL, GOOD. THAT&#39;S JUST HOW I LIKE IT.&quot; This girl really knows what she&#39;s doing. She holds a tight fist around you; not enough to cause you any actual pain or damage, but enough to cause some discomfort, constantly reminding you of your current position literally held in the palm of her hand. Meanwhile, her playful smile, self-confident air, and that knowing, penetrating look in her eyes - you&#39;d find it at least a little intimidating even at your normal size, you&#39;re sure, - make you feel totally powerless and completely under her control, and she knows it. &quot;W- what are you going to do with me?&quot; You manage to ask, timidly. She just smiles and drops you down, letting the arm holding you swing naturally past her hips as she turns around and walks just a couple of steps across the room.<br />
<br />
She takes you over to the bed, climbs over to the middle of the sprawling expanse, and sits down cross-legged. She drops you casually into the gap, encircled by her legs, and leans back to look down at you there, propping herself up on both arms. You&#39;re filled with an overwhelming mixture of fear, uncertainty, anticipation, and excitement as you take in the flesh of her massive calves and ankles penning you in from behind. Past the knee they circle around to meet together, almost within arms reach of you in the cramped enclosure, at the neat spread of brown hairs around a massive, spreading vagina. Above, the full, towering length of Pam&#39;s upper body stretches up to awesome and terrifying heights, over which looms her pretty face and confident, self-certain expression. &quot;ENJOYING THE VIEW?&quot; She mocks you. Without waiting for an answer, she continues.<br />
<br />
&quot;SO HERE&#39;S THE DEAL, SHORTY&quot; she says, taking a more serious tone. &quot;BASICALLY, IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE JESS WAS TOTALLY WASTING YOU THERE. I MEAN, HOW OFTEN DOES AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS COME AROUND? PRACTICALLY NEVER.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;WAY I SEE IT, YOU&#39;RE AN ACTUAL MAN, THAT I CAN TOTALLY CONTROL. I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT WITH YOU, AND I CAN MAKE YOU DO WHATEVER I WANT, WHENEVER I WANT. SCALED DOWN, MAYBE, BUT...&quot; She shifts and holds up one hand for a moment, with her thumb and forefinger held a few inches apart as if measuring something, &quot;BIG ENOUGH FOR WHAT I HAVE IN MIND. I&#39;VE NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CUDDLER.&quot; She chuckles, enjoying herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- what do you mean?&quot; You call out nervously. You step back instinctively, but immediately back up against one of her legs, which stops you cold. &quot;ALL SORTS OF THINGS!&quot; She replies, grinning wickedly. &quot;YOU BELONG TO ME NOW, UNDERSTAND? AND NOT LIKE A WE&#39;RE-IN-A-RELATIONSHIP SORT OF WAY. AS IN, I OWN YOU. YOU ARE MY PERSONAL POSSESSION, TO USE OR PLAY WITH AS I SEE FIT. LIKE A PET, OR A TOY. &quot; You go numb with disbelief as you think about what she&#39;s suggesting. The gentle future with a giantess that you&#39;d imagined earlier this evening, had suddenly given way into something horrible. &quot;Jess is gonna figure out what you did!&quot; You shout back, desperately wanting to believe it yourself. &quot;She&#39;s gonna tell someone!&quot; Pam is unimpressed. She leans forward and bends over you, casting you in shadow and causing her hair to spill down all around you. Her face has gone cold and dominating, and it&#39;s close enough above you that you can feel a blast of air knocking into you with every stressed syllable.<br />
<br />
&quot;FORGET JESS AND ALL THAT PEOPLE-AREN&#39;T-TOYS SHIT&quot; she says seriously. &quot;YOU&#39;RE NOT HERS ANYMORE. THE OTHER DAY WE FOUND A MOUSE HOLE BEHIND HER DRESSER, YOU KNOW? WE&#39;VE GOT AN EXTERMINATOR COMING IN A COUPLE OF DAYS TO DEAL WITH THE FUCKERS.&quot; No... no! You think to yourself, as you start to realize what she&#39;s getting at. &quot;MEANWHILE,&quot; she keeps that stare fixed on you, triumphant, &quot;JESS IS GOING TO WAKE UP TOMORROW, AND FIND NOTHING BUT BLOODSTAINS AND PAW PRINTS WHERE HER LITTLE FRIEND USED TO BE. AND AS IT TURNS OUT, I&#39;M QUITE THE PAINTER. JESS ISN&#39;T CALLING ANYONE.&quot; She allows herself another little smile, before sitting up again. &quot;THIS IS YOUR LIFE NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re overwhelmed with despair, and can only watch as she casually brushes her hair back over her shoulders, contentedly, and goes on talking down at you. &quot;YOUR NAME IS... OH, LET&#39;S SAY, &#39;TINY&#39;. YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS &#39;MISTRESS&#39; AND DO WHATEVER I SAY, IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT QUESTION. YOU WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE MY POSSESSION. GOOD BEHAVIOR MAY BE REWARDED. DISOBEDIENCE WILL BE PUNISHED. NOTHING DANGEROUS OR ANYTHING, BUT...&quot; She gestures around the room, &quot;I CAN BE QUITE CREATIVE.&quot; You get chills down your spine as she smiles down at you in satisfaction, like a cat who&#39;s just caught hold of a particularly frightened mouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW, TIME TO GET STARTED!&quot; She exclaims, suddenly cheerful. She claps her hands together sharply, twice, as if compelling you to hurry up. &quot;TAKE THOSE WET CLOTHES OFF ALREADY, YOU WON&#39;T BE NEEDING THEM ANYMORE.&quot; You comply as quickly as your shaking arms will let you, throwing them aside. &quot;I WANT YOU..&quot;</p>
