<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After stripping down fully, Tyson grabbed a towel and headed into the showers. Travis was already at one of the showers, lathering himself up; Tyson went to the shower a few away from the other man.<br />
<br />
Travis looked over at Tyson as he entered the shower and grinned. “Like what you see, faggot?” <br />
<br />
Tyson blushed bright red as he looked down; he’d been so excited in using the Clone Machine he hadn’t noticed he’d grown a boner. Tyson looked back over at Travis and grinned.<br />
<br />
“You’re one to talk,” Tyson mocked, gesturing down at Travis’ member. Travis had been soft when Tyson had entered the showers, but his dick was starting to fill with blood and harden. Travis quickly covered his erection with his hands and turned away from Tyson, clearly flustered.<br />
<br />
As Tyson watched on, Travis was slowly starting to grow a bit shorter. Travis has been a few inches taller than Tyson, but he was rapidly losing his height advantage as his limbs shortened until the two men were eye level. Next, Travis’ frame started to broaden, his shoulders widening as he took on a stockier build. Tyson looked down at the device on his wrist. ‘Cloning in progress…30%’. <br />
<br />
“Could you pass the soap?” Tyson called out to Travis, trying to get the other man to turn around so he could better watch the changes as they happened. He expected to get a snarky reply, but Travis wordlessly turned back towards Tyson and handed him the bar of soap.<br />
<br />
Travis’ pecs seemed to be swelling larger with each breath he took. As they bulked up, the pecs lost a little definition, growing round and beefy. Travis’ six pack abs started to flatten, vanishing as his stomach bulged outwards into a hard muscle gut. Hairs started to grow in a line up Travis’ stomach towards his navel; the patch of hair around his crotch was also growing thicker, starting off as dark brown before lightening to a blonde. The hairs along Travis’ shins and forearms also lightened, growing longer. Curly blonde hairs sprouted from Travis’ chest surrounding his newly hardened nipples.<br />
<br />
“I never noticed how hot your body was,” Travis commented, breaking the silence between the two men. Tyson noticed that Travis’ voice was a little less rough and gutteral than usual, sounding softer and more friendly. Travis had taken his own cock in hand, slowly stroking it as he gawked at Tyson’s wet body.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t think you were into guys,” Tyson replied, still finding the changes he was seeing right before his eyes unbelievable. As Travis continued to jerk himself, his dick grew slightly shorter but thickened considerably, his balls expanding and hanging lower.<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t…I’m not…I’m not sure,” Travis frowned, pausing midstroke to stare off into space and frown. His personality was obviously starting to change, and Travis seemed to be caught in between the new memories from Tyson of being gay and his original memories of being straight. <br />
<br />
“You certainly seem to be into guys,” Tyson smirked confidently, taking a step toward Travis and running his hands down his now hairy chest. Travis moaned out as Tyson slid his hand around Travis’ dick, beginning to jerk him.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, dude,” Travis panted, wrapping his arms around Tyson and pulling him in closer. Their mouths met for an extended kiss, massaging each other’s tongues. Tyson could feel the muscles in Travis’ arms expand around him as his upper body continued to bulk up.<br />
<br />
The two men eventually broke their kiss, and Travis slowly lowered himself down to his knees, taking Tyson’s cock in his hand. Travis’ lean legs had bulked up into two thick, sculpted thighs, the blonde hairs from his shins spreading upwards to cover his entire lower body. Travis’ tight, flat ass was also bulking up, inflating into a round bubble butt as a thin dusting of hairs grew along it.<br />
<br />
Tyson glanced down at the device on his wrist. ‘Cloning in progress…80%’. It now appeared that Tyson and Travis were pretty much identical from the neck down, except for a few small minor changes that were still taking place on Travis’ body. Travis licked his tongue along Tyson’s shaft, causing Tyson to moan out and lean against the shower wall. Travis slid the tip of Tyson’s cock into his mouth, flicking his tongue along the head of the cock. Travis slowly took a few more inches of Tyson’s cock into his mouth, sliding back and forth along the shaft. Tyson was running his hands through Travis’ wet black hair, which was growing lighter and slightly longer.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Tyson could feel his balls starting to tighten and knew he was close. Travis’ facial features were quickly readjusting into a facsimile of his own; his dark brown eyes lightened to a soft blue, his eyebrows and nose thickened. Travis had delicate, ‘pretty-boy’ like features, but those were quickly shifting into Tyson’s more masculine face. Travis’ jaw grew more square, as his thick, well groomed beared receded back into his face to leave a light stubble.<br />
<br />
 “Fuck dude, I’m going to cum.” Travis pulled Tyson’s dick out of his mouth to get a thick rope of cum right in his face. <br />
<br />
He heard the device on his wrist beep, and he looked down at it ‘Cloning process complete.’ He looked down at where Travis had been to find an exact replica of himself kneeling down, face covered in cum. He noticed that his new clone had also blown his load, having been jerking off during the blowjob.<br />
<br />
“Travis?” Tyson asked apprehensively, reaching his arm down to help his clone back up to his feet.<br />
<br />
“I still have some of Travis’ memories, but they’re quickly fading,” the new Tyson replied, dunking his head under the shower to rinse off his face. “It worked; I’m now you. Well, I’m me, who is also you.”<br />
<br />
“Shit. So Travis is gone for good?” Tyson asked, feeling a small pang of guilt. Travis had been a jerk, but did he really deserve what Tyson had done to him?<br />
<br />
<br />
“We did what we had to do,” The other Tyson replied reassuringly, “Travis was going to ruin everything for us.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re probably right. I can’t believe that actually worked.” Tyson and his clone stood face to face; it was like looking in a mirror.<br />
<br />
“One of us needs to get dressed and head to class soon. It’d be really bad if there’s two of us and we still miss our lecture,” The other Tyson suggested, grabbing a towel and starting to dry himself off.<br />
<br />
“We still have some time. First…” Tyson said, grabbing his clone and pushing him up against the wall.<br />
<br />
“First?” His clone grinned back at him, raising his eyebrows suggestively.<br />
<br />
“I’ve always wondered what I taste like,” Tyson smirked, sliding down to his knees.</p>
