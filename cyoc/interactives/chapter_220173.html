<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    Max was riding in the car with his mom, they were going over to a friend of hers and to make things even worse she had a girl about Sam&#39;s age he didn&#39;t want to play with a gir,l girls have cooties. &quot; Mom do I have to play with her&#39;&#39; she rolled her eyes `` Yes Max you do, just be nice and keep your clothes on you don&#39;t need to go showing everyone your privates&#39;&#39; Sam pouted in the back seat&quot;  <br />
       They pulled into the driveway and parked Max slowly unbuckled and followed his mom inside. Jeff was fully aware of what was happening and he wasn&#39;t looking forward to it playing with a girl all day didn&#39;t sound like fun at all.<br />
   They walked up to the house Max dragging his feet stubbornly panting lightly in the sun.  As Jeff watched his brothers feet dragging across the pavement he shared his brothers dread. Mom knocked on the door and waited, it didn&#39;t take long for her friend to answer&quot; it&#39;s so good to see you, how are you? &quot; The two hugged before she turned her attention to Max&quot; Max it&#39;s good to see you your just growing like a weed aren&#39;t you?&quot;. She moved out of the way &quot; Abbie is inside I&#39;m sure you two will have fun together and don&#39;t you worry about playing with dolls we have some trucks for you to play with&quot;.<br />
     Max followed his mom inside taking off his shoes and standing close by her with his tail pulled close. His mom noticed and hugged him &quot; it&#39;s ok sweetie it&#39;s no different than your friends at school&quot; &quot; but mom she&#39;s a girl, girls have cooties&quot; &quot; enough of that talk mister now go play with Abbie and behave that means keeping your clothes on and keeping everything to yourself&quot; &quot; yes mom&quot; . Max slowly made his way down the hall towards Abbie&#39;s room.<br />
        Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath he knocked on the door. It opened quickly and a girl a few years older than him stood there smiling &quot; hi! I&#39;m Abbie &quot; &quot; hi I&#39;m Max&quot; he stood there nervously before she moved back into her room &quot; let&#39;s play&quot; Max took a deep breath and followed her inside.<br />
      Her room was a typical girls room with lots of pink and toys everywhere dolls, plastic jewelry and a few toys that piqued Max&#39;s interest&quot; yeah I like boys toys too. Wanna play?&quot; Max looked at her and smiled&quot; yeah let&#39;s play&quot;. The two sat down on the floor and played around Max forgetting that he was playing with a girl. A little while later Max had to go pee &quot; where&#39;s the bathroom I need to pee&quot; Abbie looked up from the dolls &quot; it&#39;s down the hall I&#39;ll show you&quot;. The two left the bedroom and walked down the hall, Abbie stopped at a closed door &quot; right here&quot; she opened the door and Max went inside and was about to close the door when Abbie stopped him &quot; is it true boys can pee standing up&quot; ? Max nodded smiling&quot; yep!! Abbie giggled &quot; I thought Hannah was lying about watching her brothers pee standing up. What&#39;s it like? Is it messy?&quot; Max hopped from one foot to the other holding his paw against his crotch&quot; I can show you but I really need to pee &quot; Abbie&#39;s eyes went wide and she pushed Max into the bathroom closing the door behind her&quot; I&#39;ll show you mine if you show me yours &quot; Max didn&#39;t answer he hurried over to the toilet and lifted the seat while pulling down his shorts. His penis slid from his sheath and he grabbed it and aimed for the water.<br />
      Abbie watched closely as Max went pee, he decided to show off and wiggled his hips around while aiming his penis around the bowl. Abbie giggled and watched the boy&quot; your silly* Max finished up and let go of his penis allowing it to flop limply from his sheath. Abbie looked closely at it as Max looked back at her &quot; Can I touch it?&quot; &quot; Sure&quot; Max took off his shorts and underwear revealing everything &quot; what are those things?&quot; &quot; Those are my testicles &quot; Abbie gently examined Max&#39;s penis and testicles&quot; it&#39;s so weird &quot; she squeezed his testicles causing him to jump back&quot; ouch don&#39;t do that &quot; &quot;sorry &quot; she looked at Max and started undressing&quot; now you get to see my parts &quot; it was warmer in the bathroom and Max started panting slightly Jeff dangling from his mouth. Jeff looked around the room as Abbie finished taking off her purple panties. Jeff knew Max had never seen a girl naked before and he was excited to see his brother&#39;s response&quot; There&#39;s nothing there!&quot; Max looked at Abbies groin area with intense curiosity. Abbie used her finger to point everything out &quot; this is my vagina it&#39;s where babies come from&quot; she spread her legs wider &quot; and this is where I pee from wanna watch?&quot; Max looked at her &quot; how do you pee without a penis?&quot; Abbie put the toilet seat down &quot; girls sit down like this&quot;. Abbie sat down keeping her legs apart allowing Max to get a clear view. She started peeing as Max sat down on the floor and watched his eyes wide,mouth slightly open giving Jeff a wonderful view of the girls vagina. Abbie finished up and hopped off the toilet before wiping herself &quot; Go ahead and touch it if you want I touched yours.<br />
      Max slowly reached out and explored Abbies vagina&quot; your drooling&quot; Max looked up at her his tongue flopping around &quot; sorry I can&#39;t help it when I get hot&quot; The two continued to explore each other marveling at the differences. After a while they got dressed and went back to Abbies room and kept playing. Max was still hot and kept panting trying his best not to drool on Abbie&#39;s toys. A few hours later Max&#39;s mom knocked on the door&quot; Max honey are you ready to go home?&quot; &quot; Awww mom do I have too?&quot; &quot; It&#39;s getting late honey we need to get going &quot; Max slowly got himself ready to leave. They walked to the front door and said there goodbyes. <br />
       As Max rode home in the back seat he kept thinking about his playtime in the bathroom with Abbie. &quot;Did you two have fun?&quot; Max nodded &quot; yeah we played with her toys she kept wanting to play dress up but I didn&#39;t want to&quot; His mom smiled at him &quot; so do you think you want to play with Abbie again sometime? Even though she&#39;s a girl?&quot; &quot; She&#39;s not that bad mom even though she did try to kiss me&quot; &quot; I&#39;m glad you two had fun today&quot;. Max looked out the window and thought back to the bathroom and how exciting it was to see her weird things, maybe girls went so icky after all.</p>
