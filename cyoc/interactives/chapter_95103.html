<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deciding that whoever or whatever Vinnie would become upon transforming him again, it would  be preferable to a guy shoving his gun into your face you quickly press the “unlock” button on your keys again, hoping, praying that the transformation would be faster than Vinnie can shoot. <br />
Your wish is granted as a spray of purple sparks starts to emerge from the tip of the keys, instantly engulfing Vinnie and, in turn, incapacitating him, the purple energy crackling up and down his body. The mobster hardly had the time to process what was happening to him, enough to rise his eyebrows in shock and open his mouth, but not enough time to actually mutter the curse h was going to throw at you, let alone fire his gun.<br />
<br />
Vinnie’s body curls backwards under the power of the energy, his arms stiff at his side. He loses grip of his gun and as it falls to the ground it fades from existence, having disappeared before hitting the tarmac of the parking lot, never making a noise. <br />
You quickly back away from Vinnie as the crackling of the sparks surrounding his body grows more violent, with whole arcs of bright purple lighting extending as far as a foot from the mobster, splitting the air with a noise like thunder.  He is now caught in the middle of this vortex, like a lightning rod.<br />
You gulp and cautiously shield your face as this continues to happening, you glance over to your car and consider seeking shelter behind it. But before you can do that there is a flash and the loudest “rolling of thunder” yet as Vinny’s clothes...explode. <br />
<br />
Similarly to how your car transformed for the first time the mobster’s suit, hat, shoes and gloves violently disassemble unravelling themselves into strings that surround him like a tornado. The strings fly through the air so quickly that they only partially obscure him behind a sort of blackish haze. This gives you a full frontal of his now naked body; it was still similar to how Keith’s bulked up physique had been, but sporting a decent amount of coarse, black body hair dusting his chest and curling along his limbs and stomach in a nice treasure trail.  You particularly notice his dick which had grown even from Keith’s already enlarged member and was fully erect under the electricity surrounding him, a massive column of flesh standing amidst a forest of black bush.<br />
You are almost sad as you see that monster cock shrink again....retracting into Vinny’s body by several inches. The rest of Vinny’s body likewise shrinks; losing about 5 inches of his impressive, intimidating height, putting him back at about Keith’s original height. The body hair fades away from the rapidly paling skin, giving you a last, good view of his impressive muscles before they as well lose their definition, fat returning to the body and accumulating over his stomach in a slight gut.  <br />
<br />
You gasp as you notice of whom this new body reminds you off and your hopes are confirmed as Vinny’s short, pomaded hair grows out into a shaggy, untended mane, fading back to Keith’s sandy blonde. The face becomes softer again, fading from a hardened Italian mobster back to an All-American couch potato. Your heart makes a jump; Keith is back! <br />
Now the thread-tornado starts to close in on Keith, reconstructing his old outfit line by line; grubby Pink Floyd T-Shirt, old pair f shorts and those ridiculous crocks. The purple lightning, the sparks of energy, all disappears abruptly and all that’s left is good old Keith standing in the parking lot. <br />
Taking a step back Keith’s eyes are wide, his lips half open as he looks at his hands dumbfounded, then the strands of hair hanging in his face, then his shirt, gripping the fabric like it was a sort of holy grail. <br />
<br />
“Keith?” you ask cautiously, “you alright, dude?”<br />
<br />
It takes Keith a few seconds to answer, “Yeah....” he mutters, “I’m Keith again...” he shakes his head, “I mean I’m me again....” he puts a head on his forehead, as if suffering from a headache. <br />
<br />
You take a step closer, worried that Keith might collapse, whatever those keys did to him, it looked like enough to knock a guy out. <br />
“Are you alright?” you ask and with a gulp you inquire further “Do you remember what happened?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m good,” Keith assures you, still seeming somewhat unaccustomed to the sound of his own voice, “I remember you using those keys to play dress up with me and...” he grimaces, “...I remember being Vinnie...” <br />
<br />
“That was definitely weird...” <br />
<br />
Keith laughs “You don’t know half of it!” he looks at you, grinning, “You only saw the whole thing from outside...I actually felt it happening. Dude; I was a whole other person...not just my body, my mind as well, my soul....” he shakes his head, “...it was like my identity, my whole self was just so many Lego blocks and those things,” he nods at the keys in your hand, “took them apart and rearranged them,” he laughs again, “that guy I was, Vinnie, he wasn’t just a role or something, he...I was a whole person. He knew Italian, he knew how to handle weapons, he could have recited the whole military history of the Napoleonic Wars to you. The whole time he was here he ached for a glass of beer and Keith hates...I mean, I hate, that stuff....” <br />
<br />
You awkwardly clear your throat, “Listen...I’m sorry....I had no idea that these keys could do that to you...” <br />
<br />
Keith snorts and grins at you, “Are you kidding? This was freaking awesome!” <br />
<br />
As your mouth falls open in surprise at Keith’s reaction, he continues to gush about the whole experience.<br />
<br />
“You cannot even imagine how cool it is to actually remember being someone else. I mean you can get insight into someone else’s head when reading a book or watching a movie, you can pretend to be someone else while playing a computer game, but...actually being some complete other dude who is absolutely different from you in just about every way and then coming back and remember it... fuck....” <br />
<br />
You blink,”So you’re not mad?”<br />
<br />
“Vinnie was so...strong and confident....I never felt that way in my entire life...and he had fucking style...” he grips his shirt again, “...that suit and the Italian leather gloves were quite a change from this...” he scratches his chin, “I kinda liked it actually...” <br />
<br />
You can’t help but grin at Keith’s enthusiasm about his transformation, “Well I’m glad it was such a great experience for you...”<br />
<br />
“One of the best things ever to happen to me,” Keith assures, “being that guy opened my mind to completely new ways of thinking...of being....” his smile turns somewhat weird as he looks at you, “Think we can do that again?” <br />
<br />
You knit your brow “Transforming you back into Vinnie?” Keith could not be serious about that....<br />
<br />
“Back into Vinne, into somebody entirely different, I don’t care which...just morph me again and this time around let me stay in that state for a few days at least...Vinnie came and went in a whirlwind.. I really wanna explore this...savour it” <br />
<br />
You are skeptical, “But we can’t control who you become, Vinnie threatened to kill me...what if the next dude does the same? What if they run off? What if I simply can’t change you back?”<br />
<br />
Keith shakes his head, “Well I can’t make any promises about the trying to kill you thing, and yes, I can confirm Vinnie was ready to shoot you and would have ‘whacked’ you the moment you gave him the keys, but I don’t think returning me to normal will be a problem...” <br />
<br />
“How you know?” <br />
<br />
He grins, “I just know,” Keith says and presents himself to you, “come on, morph me again!” he takes hold of your hand and points it, and the keys, square at his chest, “Come on!  Morph me!&quot;</p>
