<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dillon and Jacob just set on the couch for a few minutes for Dillon to get some inspiration. Dillon looked at Jacob with his super muscular build, and his monkey tail swishing behind him. He combined the two features and thought of one thing that has those in common... &#39;Gorilla...&#39; Dillon thought to himself and smirked. &quot;Jacob will become my pet gorilla.&quot; Dillon said into the ring as Jacob looked over at him. &quot;His intelligence will be the same as now, but he will act like a natural primate for the most part.&quot; Dillon watched as the ring took effect. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Jacob. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy the process.&quot; Dillon said already noticing dirty blonde hair sprouting from the back of Jacob&#39;s neck. &quot;Whatever man. At least I&#39;ll have opposable thumbs so I can hold a controller still.&quot; Jacob stared at his hands. &quot;Dude, you&#39;ll be able to do that with your feet soon.&quot; Dillon commented.<br />
<br />
Dillon watched as fur spread around Jacob&#39;s head except his ears, mouth, and nose which seemed to be changing. Jacob&#39;s ears became much larger and his lips started spreading wider while his nostrils started flaring outward as his face formed into that of a chimp&#39;s. &quot;Ooh ooh ahh! This feels weird man. EEK!&quot; Jacob stared to make all sorts of monkey noises as fur spread further down his body. &quot;Mind if I have a feel?&quot; Dillon asked seeing the fur spread down Jacob&#39;s shoulder. Jacob only moaned in ecstasy as it spread down to his wrists. &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a &#39;sure, why not&#39;.&quot; Dillon rubbed Jacob&#39;s furry shoulder. &quot;Ook! Yeah... That feels ahh...&quot; Jacob started to loose his speech with the further changes in his hands. His fingers started growing and his skin started to become more wrinkly.<br />
<br />
Dillon rubbed Jacob&#39;s shoulder feeling the soft hair sprouting all around him. &quot;Man, your a lot softer than I would imagine.&quot; Dillon said feeling Jacob&#39;s smooth hair. The hair spread all around his torso apart from his chest where his pecs and abs were unchanged except for more wrinkly skin. &quot;Ehh ahh ahh...&quot; Jacob was now in full ape mode when his hair spread to his legs. His eyes closed and tongue out as the fur spread to his ankles. Jacob&#39;s feet were starting to shrink slightly as his toes started to grow and they begin to look like fingers. Jacob wiggled his toes to show just how dexterous they had become. &quot;Hmm...&quot; Dillon wondered as he grasped Jacob&#39;s foot in his hand. &quot;Ook!&quot; Jacob grasped his foot in the same way folding his toes in between Dillon&#39;s fingers. &quot;It really is a hand foot!&quot; Dillon said.<br />
<br />
The final changes came as Dillon released his grip on Jacob&#39;s foot. Jacob attempted to stand back up but something didn&#39;t feel right with it. &quot;Urk!&quot; Jacob started to hunch down as his arms stretched out reaching to the floor as his new posture started to align. Jacob&#39;s tail twitched as he started to clench his fists as his knuckles were now his support for standing. Though still recognizable by his hair and eyes, Jacob was now a full gorilla man and Dillon couldn&#39;t be happier how he turned out. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you feel?&quot; Dillon asked. &quot;Ooh ooh ehh ahh-&quot; Jacob slapped his giant hand over his simian mouth. Even though he retained his intelligence, he lost his speech completely. &quot;Huh. I like it better when you talked.&quot; Dillon said and brought the ring up again. &quot;Jacob will be able to speak like a human again occasionally making monkey noises.&quot; The ring glowed again. &quot;Now let&#39;s try this again. How do you feel?&quot; Dillon repeated. &quot;Well... Hairy for sure. But more relaxed somehow. Ahh!&quot; Jacob said picking at his scalp looking for any bugs that potentially hid in there. &quot;Makes sense. Gorilla&#39;s are pretty laid back animals. Perfect for your personality.&quot; Dillon said scratching Jacob&#39;s chin. &quot;Ooh ohh... That feels nice...&quot; Jacob started falling back into the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right... Whose my favorite ape? Who is that?&quot; Dillon started talking to Jacob in a baby voice while scratching his chin. &quot;I... I am... I&#39;m your favorite-&quot; Jacob shot his eyes open. &quot;OOK! What did I just say!?&quot; Jacob pushed Dillon away. &quot;Don&#39;t you remember? Your my pet now. You like the way I talked to you there.&quot; Dillon smiled putting his hands on Jacob&#39;s bare chest. &quot;Just think about it. I&#39;ll be taking care of you. You and I living together, hanging out, video games and movies,all the banana you can eat, plus it&#39;ll just be nice to have company around.&quot; Jacob didn&#39;t know what to say. He never knew Dillon enjoyed his company as much as he did. Maybe it was an effect of the ring that altered his mind, Jacob seemed more affectionate about being a pet rather than just a friend. &quot;Your willing to take care of me as a domestic animal? You have weird fantasies.&quot; Jacob commented with a smirk. Dillon curled his tails around his waist and started stroking them. &quot;And your lucky enough to be apart of them.&quot; He let his tails go and stood up to stretch his muscles.<br />
<br />
With night approaching, and Jacob sound asleep curled up on the couch, Dillon grabbed a soda from the fridge and reflected on what kind of day he just had. In between turning himself into a behemoth with two reptilian tails, turning his landlord into an animal, his coworker his pet, and even giving the human population assorted animal tails, it was pretty crazy. He was almost scared to sleep in resentment of waking up from a dream. But something told him this was all real. Was it the rings presence that made him feel that way. And why was he the one to revive such a gift? Surly there were more qualified people than him. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t dwell on it. Like Jacob said, I wouldn&#39;t turn this down if I knew what this ring did...&quot; Dillon yawned and started slumping his way to his bedroom. He slowly shut the door to avoid waking Jacob and planted himself in bed to which he modified for his size. &quot;I wonder what events await me tomorrow then...&quot; Dillon asks himself before drifting off to sleep.</p>
