<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well, the gym was as good a place to start as any, Jayden thought to himself. The light on his phone sweeping across the sign before he headed off down the hallway. The double doors at the end of the hall were open, well, one was open, the other lay haphazardly on the ground. The light on his phone disappeared into the cavernous room beyond.<br />
<br />
It was like any high school gym he had seen before, only completely falling apart. The wood of the floor was cracked and warped, and glass from the broken basketball backboards crunched underfoot. Windows up near the ceiling let in a surprising amount of moonlight, enough to Jayden could see around the room without his flashlight. The set of bleachers under those windows had collapsed, but the ones on the other side of the gym were still standing, but probably not all that sound. A few doors led off from the gym to locker rooms or offices.<br />
<br />
The world seemed to blink around Jayden. He had to squint as light suddenly flooded the room, the sound of people talking echoed around him, the squeak of sneakers on polished wood floors and the rhythmic thump of dribbling basket balls. One his eyes adjusted he saw the gym as it once was. A basketball team practicing under the eyes of a coach, all dressed in their uniform tank tops and shorts that were a bit too on the short side for Jayden&#39;s comfort. A scattering of other teens sat in the bleachers. It looked like a scene out of one of the 1980s teen movies. The girls with big hair in massive curls or ponytails, the boys with longer hair as well, swept back, both genders dressed in bright colors.<br />
<br />
No one seemed to notice him. He took another step into the gym and everything vanished returning to the old dilapidated room, except for a blue glow below one of the nets. No, it wasn&#39;t just a glow. It took Jayden a moment to make out the shape as he got used to being in darkness again. It was human in shape but translucent. Tall, muscular, and wearing that basketball uniform, one of those wild, out of control hairstyles. He was the type of guy that would probably have been pretty popular in his time. He just stood there, however, staring up at the basketball net. A ghost?<br />
<br />
Jayden brought up his phone and snapped a picture. The flash went off though and the apparition turned his head and stared right at Jayden. He backed up but the ghost just smirked and turned to a ribbon of mist. Jayden turned to run, as that seemed the sensible thing but the ribbon took him right in the middle of the chest, filling him with a cold that seemed to course through his veins.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he was back in the brightly lit gym. He tried to move but his body just wouldn&#39;t respond. &quot;Jack!&quot; It was a furtive whisper that came off from his right. His head turned of its own accord and he saw one of the basketball players over there, right below the edge of the bleachers. It wasn&#39;t the ghost. This guy was a bit shorter if more broad shouldered, with a mess of curly brown hair and a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
Jayden&#39;s eyes swiveled back to where the team was now taking a break and back to the other young man. His feet started moving towards the bleachers, and he followed him under. He felt his mouth start to move, but it wasn&#39;t his voice that came out. &quot;What are you doing, Matt? If coach catches us under here..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop worrying.&quot; Matt paused by the back wall, the dim light filtering through the benches above would make it hard to see them even if someone did look under the bleachers.<br />
<br />
Jayden still couldn&#39;t move his body, it was acting on its own. He caught sight of one of his arms though as he gripped a pole to duck under it. More muscular than his own, with bigger hands. Faint blond hair was on the arm instead of brown. He stepped up next to Matt and bent his head down a bit as the two kissed. Jayden had never kissed another guy before, he had no interest in men, not in that way. But the body he was in felt a thrill at it. A thrill, and fear. &quot;What if someone catches us?&quot; His body whispered, looking back to the way they came.<br />
<br />
&quot;The danger is half the fun.&quot; Matt moved so Jack&#39;s back was up against the wall, giving him another kiss. He felt Matt lifting the tank top he wore, pushing the bottom of it back over his head. He felt a hand rubbing against his chest. Matt broke the kiss and Jayden could see the torso of the body he was in. Lean and muscular, with an impressive chest. He was mostly smooth except for a short blond treasure trail below his belly button. Matt got onto his knees in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt..&quot; He felt himself say, just a bit of warning but also eager. Matt pulled down Jayden&#39;s shorts and jock strap. Jayden wanted to gulp, or blink in surprise. He was hung, or rather the body he was in was. His cock was long and thick, and already mostly hard, and uncut which was weird for Jayden to see, thought he foreskin was pulled back away from the head of his cock. That quickly became fully hard as Matt took the glistening reddish head of that cock into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Jayden&#39;s mental gasp echoed the one his body gave. He may not be in control but he could feel everything. Jayden had once gotten a blowjob from his last girlfriend, but she had been reluctant and it wasn&#39;t very good. This was something else. Matt eagerly worked his tongue over that huge tool. He twined his fingers in curly brown hair as Matt took as much of the cock into his mouth as he could, a surprising amount.<br />
<br />
With a gasp that his body echoed, he came. Eyes, squeezed shut, he could feel every spurt and twitch of that foreign cock as Matt eagerly drank up every last drop. Suddenly, his cock was cold.<br />
<br />
Jayden opened his eyes, he was back in control and back in the ruined gym. He stood where he had in the vision, under the bleachers, back in his body and clothes. Though his tee-shirt was pulled up and over his head exposing his chest, and his jeans open and his underwear pulled down to let his cock flop free. He stared at it. That wasn&#39;t his cock. It was the one in the vision. Jack&#39;s. Long, thick, uncut, with a halo of blond hair around the base that darkened to Jayden&#39;s more familiar brown body hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?&quot; The whisper came from inside Jayden&#39;s head. The voice was Jack&#39;s. &quot;If not, too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jayden said, worry in his voice. He shoved that cock back into his pants, it felt strange in his jeans, and unfamiliar weight and bulge. He did his pants back up and pulled down his shirt. The silence dragged on. &quot;Are you there? Jack?&quot; He dared to say what he thought the ghost&#39;s name was.<br />
<br />
Jayden felt a shiver run through him and his mouth began to move. &quot;Your body is slowly becoming mine now. You can either join with me and we&#39;ll become one, or you can fight it and I&#39;ll just get rid of you and take it anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t..&quot; Jayden&#39;s right forearm suddenly swelled with muscle his hand cramping as it grew bigger, big enough to palm a basketball. Then his hand was around his throat, and squeezing. Just enough to let Jayden know he wasn&#39;t in complete control. He could feel Jack stretching to maintain that bit of control, but it was becoming easier for the ghost by the minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Jayden finally rasped and the hand dropped from his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;A body for me and a body for Matt. And a way out of here for us both. You... brought friends. Lure one away from the others and to the locker rooms. Matt will do the rest.&quot; It felt strange to have someone else using his throat, and the more Jack used it, the more it sounded like the ghost&#39;s voice to his ears and less like his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if you work with me we both get out of here. If not..&quot; Jayden felt a straining, something pushing against him. Blue light began to drift from his body but it wasn&#39;t the ghost leaving, it was himself being pushed out. &quot;Okay! Okay.&quot; Jayden did not want to be a ghost trapped in this school until he could do what Jack did and steal a body. He was sure that would be his fate if he fought. He felt Jack&#39;s pleasure and felt himself sink back into his body. As if agreeing to work together triggered something he felt his tee begin to tighten a little as his chest grew in some muscle, and the bottom of his shirt creeped upwards as he gained an inch or so of height. It felt good.<br />
<br />
Jayden sighed and picked his way carefully out from under the bleachers. He could try to get away, maybe the ghost was still trapped in the school enough that leaving would pull him free. Or he could condemn one of his friends to the same fate.</p>
