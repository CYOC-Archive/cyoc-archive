<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ugh, get off me, you stupid cow!&quot; yelled the Zoo worker beneath the alligator.  Mary Lou was soaking wet, and she could feel her body beginning to change again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on!  I&#39;ll get her off, &quot; yelled Kim.  She grabbed the alligator&#39;s tail and started to pull.  She knew that the massive alligator was too big to move, but she hoped that she could divert the alligator&#39;s attention enough to help the other Zoo worker wriggle free.  Thankfully, the muzzle was still on and would protect her from serious harm.  <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Mary Lou, &quot; said Kim.  &quot;Be a good girl and let the nice woman go.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the alligator refused to budge.  Evelyn could feel her body tingling, and she knew she was beginning to change.  Evelyn had planned to just swap with Kim, and help her change back later after they caught up with Mary Lou.  But this was even better.  Now Mary Lou would get her just dessert.  The alligator wiggled her large body on top of the real Mary Lou, spreading the soapy solution between them.<br />
<br />
Kim closed her eyes and grunted as she pulled.  She could hear the other Zoo worker moaning, shouting &quot;No, no, stop! It&#39;s too much!&quot; She could hear the sound of clothes ripping and tearing.<br />
<br />
My god, thought Kim.  Has she gotten free of the muzzle?  Is she eating her?<br />
<br />
Kim redoubled her efforts and pulled harder.  Her rescue attempts were putting a strain on her muscles, and she felt them bulging tightly against her clothes.  She was surprised when she actually was able to pull the alligator backwards a little.  But her hands slipped off the tail, and the alligator leapt forward back onto the poor girl.  Kim opened her eyes, and tried to grab her tail again.  <br />
<br />
The alligator&#39;s tail flapped wildly.  It looked smaller, and smoother.  It was almost like her tail had shrunk in Kim&#39;s hands.  Kim reached forward then looked at her hands.  They were green!  At first she thought that perhaps something had rubbed off Mary Lou&#39;s skin onto them.  But then Kim looked closer.  Her hands were much bigger, with thick stubby webbed digits that ended in sharp claws.  They were the claws of an alligator!<br />
<br />
Kim was dazed by this revelation.  Backing away she tripped on the alligator&#39;s tail and landed on the its back.  The warm soapy suds drenched her chest.  She could feel her clothes constricting as her body began to expand.  She had to get away from the alligator!  It was doing something to her, changing her somehow.  She struggled to push off its back.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a hand reached up from beneath the alligator.  A clawed hand! She looked down and saw the face of the other Zoo worker, peaking out from beneath the alligator&#39;s muzzled snout.  Her face was green with reptilian eyes, and was rapidly developing its own snout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no.  I&#39;m not going through this alone, &quot; said Mary Lou.  &quot;I want to stay as much human as possible. &quot;<br />
<br />
Kim struggled frantically, but Mary Lou&#39;s grip was like iron.  She held tight to Kim, and pulled her close to Evelyn&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the kid alone, Mary Lou, &quot; said the rapidly shrinking alligator.  &quot;This is between you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim was shocked!  Mary Lou was speaking!  The muzzle had slipped off her shrinking snout.<br />
<br />
&quot;You brought her into this, not me, &quot; said the Zoo worker.  Well, the former zoo worker.  She looked like some kind of hybrid between a human and an alligator.<br />
<br />
The alligator had changed now, too. She was much smaller, and resembled a hybrid herself. The spines on her back were less sharp, and her back was smooth and slick.  Amy slid off her back, as the two monsters fought beneath her.<br />
<br />
As she stood she felt wobbly.  She had to stand on the balls of her feet to stay erect. She stood back and watched as the two creatures fought.  Grabbing each others hands, pulling at one another&#39;s hair, rolling around on the ground, snapping their jaws at one another.  It was a brutal fight, without mercy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, you monster, leave her alone!&quot; yelled Kim.<br />
<br />
One of the creatures stopped fighting, and looked at Kim.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not the monster, she is!  You don&#39;t know what she has done!&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
The other creature used  the diversion to get in one good punch.  She shoved the dazed first hybrid off her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, watch who you are calling a monster!&quot; said the second creature, as she stood up and brushed herself off.  &quot;C&#39;mon kid, let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim backed up.  &quot;Wait, who are you?  Do you work for the Zoo or are you Mary Lou?&quot; asked Kim apprehensively.<br />
<br />
Evelyn stood up, and shoved Mary Lou very hard, knocking her to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Evelyn.  I worked for the Zoo. She is Mary Lou!&quot; said Evelyn.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou popped up, and growled at her.  &quot;Don&#39;t listen to her!  She was an alligator just a few minutes ago.  You can&#39;t trust anything she says!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot; said Kim examining the girls as they stood side by side.  They looked identical. They were tall, about six feet with a reddish black mixture of short hair.  They had hard green scaly skin, with very feminine hourglass figures and pert generous breasts covered by scales.  A long thick tail trailed behind both of their backs. &quot;How can I tell? You look exactly the same!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou began to laugh loudly, and even Evelyn couldn&#39;t suppress a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look in the mirror, dear, &quot; said Mary Lou.  &quot;So do you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim turned and looked at the one way glass at the edge of the closure.  It acted as a mirror, and she looked at her reflection with awe.  She looked down and saw that her feet had grown into claws, tearing her shoes and socks apart in the process.  Her clothes had torn around her expanding body, leaving just tattered rags covering her green scaly skin.  Her tail whipped behind her, moving slowly back and forth with a mind of its own.  But the most shocking was the face.  She had the same short snout filled with sharp teeth, the same short reddish black hair, and the same reptilian eyes. She reached up and touched her face, still unable to believe it was true.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou walked up behind her, and placed her arm around Kim&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Welcome to the club, sister.&quot;</p>
