<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke was playing some video games when he made his wish. So, after startling a little, he ignored the glow on his ring and hept playing. It didn&#39;t take so long when he felt hungry and went for a snack. <br />
<br />
When he came out of his bedroom, he heard some baby cries and he thought that it could be from his neighbors&#39; house. He took an apple and bite it, but when he was returning to his bedroom, he heard the baby crying again. This time, so close that he wasn&#39;t sure about it coming from his neighbors&#39; house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel?!&quot; He called for her sister because ahe was the only one there except for him. But she didn&#39;t reply. In fact, it was too quiet. His sister used to like playing loud music or chatting with her friends. It was truly suspicious.<br />
<br />
Luke decided to go to his sister&#39;s room and soon he realized that the baby cries came from there. Is Rachel babysitting another kid? He wondered at the moment he opened the door. There was a little girl, no older than 5 years old crying over a pile of clothes. Luke was completely confused. His sister wasn&#39;t there and that little girl was using her clothes. He made a few step and immediately noticed that the clothes around her were soaked with pee. The little girl noticed his presence and quickly ran to hug his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke! Luke! Help me!! I shrunk!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sis?&quot; Luke asked her. It was insane, but it was the better explanation for what he&#39;s seeing. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; She was sobbing. &quot;I was taking some selfies when I started to pee and get smaller! Help me! I&#39;m scared!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke was processing the information and then he remembered the wish he made a moment ago. He wished she wasn&#39;t older than him and now he was the older brother. He was glad that his wish came true. However, he ignored that his ring wasn&#39;t for making wishes. So, the age that was taken from Rachel was going to be transferred to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I&#39;m the big brother! You won&#39;t make fun of me anymore!!&quot; He laughed at his sister. He hadn&#39;t intentions to turn her back to normal for now. &quot;As the older sibling, I&#39;m the one on charge now! I&#39;m going to call Mike and Jimmy! We&#39;re going to watch some horror movies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!! Mom and dad said you can&#39;t watch those movies!&quot; Rachel tried to protest, but she was ignored by Luke who was already calling to his friends. They lived very close to his house, so they arrived in less than five minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it real what you&#39;ve told us?&quot; Mike asked as he came in, Luke just nodded. &quot;Cool!! I want to watch a bloodbath!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And about your sister... Is that true too?&quot; Jimmy asked. He had a secret crush on Luke&#39;s sister and was desiring to see her new look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Rachel! Come here!!&quot; Luke shouted but she ignored him. &quot;Mmm... Give a minute...&quot; He left for a moment and then he returned with little Rachel on his arms. She was trying to get free but she can&#39;t fight against her brother. &quot;Say hi to little Rachel! My parents said she&#39;s going to babysitting me this weekend but I think it&#39;s going to be the opposit... *Buuurp!!&quot; Luke suddenly let out a huge belch. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... *Buuurp!!&quot; He burped again, this time longer and louder than before. Then, his stomach started to gurgle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Jimmy asked him. He, Mike and Rachel were staring at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me... I need to go to the bathroom.&quot; Luke apologized. He left Rachel on the floor and she immediately ran back to her room. &quot;Look for a good movie meanwhile!&quot; He told his friends before he ran to the bathroom. However, he only made a few steps when he started to fart like crazy. His friends looked at him disgusted and he apologized really ashamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke!!&quot; Jimmy shouted at him when he noticed a wet spot in Luke&#39;s front shorts. Luke was horrified, he was peeing his shorts in front of his friends!! He tried to stop but he couldn&#39;t. In fact, the wet spot was so big that it started to drip through the fabric. He needed to take those shorts off, but he didn&#39;t expect that when he did that a huge turd started to come out from his anus. His undies started to stretch and make a big bulge on his behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross!!&quot; Mike said. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you&#39;re the kind of guys that need diapers!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m I&#39;m...&quot; Luke was stuttering in shame. &quot;He wanted to run away but he can&#39;t. If he moves the shit in his undies will come out and that will be way more embarrassing!</p>
