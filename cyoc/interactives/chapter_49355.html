<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the bell for lunch rang, Jennifer hid as best she could with a stiff spine and wide legs.  Left alone, Jennifer stood up awkwardly and made to leave.  She had to find some way of reversing this change, she thought.  There was just something wrong about this body that she did not like.  Being a walking sex-dream of teen-aged young men in a high-school could only end badly.<br />
<br />
Once she was standing the peculiar arch in her back threatened to topple her over backward.  She bent at the waist and found that by sticking her butt out she was able to maintain some balance on her long legs.  Her legs splayed a little, Jennifer felt like she trying to expose as much of her body to be examined as she was able.  The way that her skirt seemed to hang off her hips did not help either.<br />
<br />
She tried walking.  Her stride was confident and the force that seemed to separate her knees when she was still disappeared when she moved.  As she made her way slowly to the front of the room her wide hips swayed as she put one foot in front of the other.  It was a model's cat-walk stride and Jennifer loved it.  Her running shoes flopped around a little on her now smaller feet and soon found herself stumbling.  Jennifer fell forward catching herself on the teacher's desk before she did a complete face-plant.  Her body was awkward to deal with, she noted and it was not designed to do much but look pretty.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door opened.  In walked Mr. Steward, the absent computer teacher.  Jennifer found herself frozen leaning against the desk having been caught by her teacher in a very sexy pose.  Mr. Steward was likewise frozen in the doorway staring at a pin-up model that had some how invaded his classroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing in here?&quot;  Mr. Steward said levelly.  He was not the sort of person that enjoyed having pranks played on him.  He was absolutely certain that this woman could not be anything but a prank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; Jennifer started.  She had to think.  What could she say that wouldn't get her arrested?  She wondered if he would even be able to recognize her through all the changes that she had gone through.  &quot;Mr. Steward, do you know who I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound familiar,&quot;  Mr. Steward said, &quot;like one of my students.  But I would remember some one like you taking my class.  I mean, I remember all of my students.  Not just the pretty girls.  Not that I'm looking ... in that way!  Look, is this a prank?  Who put you up to this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was not really listening to his ranting.  He had remembered her voice so that had been changed.  Her new sex-pot appearance, however, seemed to have fried his brain.  She wondered if she should try to get him to help her.  Slowly she shifted around and perched herself on the corner of his desk.  She tried to strike a pose that suggested he could trust this mysterious woman that was in a classroom she should really not be.  Unfortunately it just came off as a slutty girl making a kissy face while sticking her tits out at an older man.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't a prank, Mr. Steward,&quot; Jennifer said in a hurt voice.  &quot;I need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Steward remained as far from his desk as he could.  The door had closed behind him and he felt trapped but unwilling to leave.  Keeping his hands well clear of anywhere suggestive, he tried to lean casually against the wall obscuring the small window in the door.  He tried a laugh, but it was nervous and labored.  &quot;I don't know if I can really help you.  Ah ... in any way.  Maybe there is someone else ... that is not me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer noted that Mr. Steward was starting to sweat.  He seemed incredibly uncomfortable.  She wanted to smile but her strangely immobile face would not let her.  This sexy body of her's was getting him all bothered.  She could see a bulging in his pants.  She felt something herself and she wanted to show off her body to this man.  Without really noticing what she was doing, Jennifer started to rub her hands over her stomach and thighs.  Slow and methodically she caressed her toned muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, I'm stuck here.  I can't leave this room until you help me.&quot;  Jennifer lied.  She tried to put as much cuteness in her voice as she could.<br />
<br />
Mr. Steward almost whimpered.  &quot;Can I leave?&quot; he asked meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until you help me with a little problem I'm having with my body.&quot;  Jennifer liked the way that he asked her permission.  Her hands had started a race up and down her sides, from her knees to her neck and back again.  Her thighs were rubbing together.  She licked her lips a little and winked at her teacher.  He seemed to be going mad just looking at her and that made her act up even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, I'm stuck with this little curse thingy,&quot; Jennifer said quietly.  &quot;If you help me out with something I might be able to treat you a little.&quot;  Jennifer felt a hot flash run around her body.  She could not tell if it was because she was aroused or from the curse.  She had to press on.  &quot;I need you to close your eyes, Mr. Steward.&quot;<br />
<br />
He did so.  He was standing in the door way with his eyes shut, shaking from repressed excitement and embarrassment.  He knew that at any moment someone was going to pop out and take a picture of him being improper with this woman.  He would get in considerable trouble and then be locked up for good.  He just wished this sexy woman with her huge breasts and luscious lips would just hurry up and finish this joke so he could get away.<br />
<br />
Jennifer felt the warmth filling her body only in certain spots.  This was not a full-body change like earlier.  Had she thought this through at all?  What was she trying to do to this man?  She had got him this far, how was she going to get him to turn her back into herself?  In a panic she spoke without thinking.  &quot;Now I want you to think of something normal.  Like a normal, girl.  Something normally sexy to you.  Not too weird.&quot;  Gah, she did not want to have to say her name but there was no way to get him to think that without telling him straight out.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at Mr. Steward now.  Her hands on her breasts.  She was scared that he had a goofy smile on his face.  That he had a huge erection.  That he still had his eyes shut tight.  Then the changes hit her distorted body.  At that same moment, Mr. Steward fainted dead away leaving the door free of obstruction.<br />
<br />
Jennifer bolted.  She ran headless of her direction.  She just wanted to find somewhere private to think.  Past lockers and classrooms, she ran.  The halls empty of students gone for lunch.  Through some doors, she stopped out of breath in a little used stairwell at the back end of the school.  Alone.  But what changes had Mr. Steward made to her?</p>
