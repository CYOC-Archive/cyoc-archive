<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen got up the next morning and ate, she went to her closet and rummaged through her new wardrobe, finding that she no longer had a cheer outfit. Memories of her new life slid into her thoughts, she had tried out for the team but they rejected her, saying they weren&#39;t looking for wrestlers but cheerleaders, Jen was somewhat disappointed, but she found that she was now a bit of a tomboy, and good with cars, so that was a good trade she thought.<br />
<br />
She dressed in workout gear, a tight pair of yoga pants and a tank top, she decided to go without the bottoms that matched her sports bra, just to tease a bit, and went to the gym she was now a member of. Jen entered and was greeted by the owner, and proceeded to the weight area. After a hearty half hour workout she sat on the bench catching her breath when someone greeted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn girl! Your in here early as ever!&quot; Jen looked up at the woman, a tall, gorgeous black woman, the name hit her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey Jenna, yeah I&#39;m early as ever.&quot; Jen was getting the hang of learning her reality as it changed. &quot;How&#39;s your week been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh it&#39;s been a nightmare. You remember that guy I was tellin&#39; you about, Tyrone?&quot; Jen was about to answer but stopped when she realized this wasn&#39;t an actual question &quot;Well, I dolled up for this sucker, and he had the nerve to tell me he was seein&#39; my best gal. I see that bitch again I&#39;m gonna give her a piece of my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen smiled, talked for a bit and they worked out together. Some time later they were sitting in the gym&#39;s refreshment area, cooling off and talking when a group of six guys walked by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl, look at that man meat, I&#39;d love me some of that.&quot; Jenna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you can&#39;t have them all, I want some of that too.&quot; Jen said. It was then that the curse kicked into action, what did she want from them, their muscles, no that wasn&#39;t it, their hair that was it. No, oh I know, she wanted their cocks, but which one? Eh, I&#39;ll give them all to her, let her enjoy that. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Jen felt a mass shove it&#39;s way into existence between her legs, it swelled faster and ripped through the front of her yoga pants, she looked down to see the biggest cock she had ever seen, and it was growing even larger. Jen blushed and Jenna laughed at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girl, I don&#39;t know why you bother with those pants, they ain&#39;t big enough for that package of yours.&quot; Jenna said, as Jen&#39;s cock and balls finished growing, to her shock she blurted out, &quot;Yeah, I gotta start wearing sweats, this thing gives me so much trouble.&quot; Jen looked at Jenna, &quot;I&#39;m gonna go &quot;freshen up&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm Hmm, you go on and take care of yourself girl, I know what you double sexes are like, my sis is one too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen walked to the bathroom, the biggest dick she had ever seen, larger than any pornstar&#39;s now resided on her crotch, and the world was now perfectly okay with it. It seemed that one in every three women were born with a cock, and the sizes were usually average, but Jen was one of the exceptions, her mind raced with memories. The time she measured it at twelve inches when she was eleven, all the times she was rejected by boys because her cock was enormous and the most recent visit to the doctor, who informed her that unlike her breasts, which seemed to have settled on a final cup size, her cock would probably just keep growing. <br />
<br />
Alien sensations filled her as her cock waved in front of her when she entered the last stall of the woman&#39;s bathroom. Jen sat down and looked at her monster, she put her elbow at her crotch and measured her arm against it, her new cock was at least thirty inches long. Jen stared at it, her new limb hungry for attention, she cupped her balls, and felt like she was holding two grapefruits, the feeling was incredible, she got up and looked around the stall and found something odd, a funnel against the side wall. It was labeled &quot;sperm receptacle&quot; and she remembered that this is where she would need to do her business. Jen pushed her cock into the funnel, it expanded and wrapped her massive member, she groaned in pleasure as she humped it, shoving deeper with each push until she finally cam, she moaned softly, her body forcing her to act as she normally would, but inside she was screaming with ecstasy. <br />
<br />
She sat panting for a bit, her behemoth softened and pulled back to her, her flaccid state seemed to be at fifteen inches long, it hanged over her massive balls. Jen reached down without thinking to check and see if she was still somewhat female and found she still had her womanhood. Just then someone entered the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girl, I brought you some sweats so you don&#39;t have to walk with that beast flopping out, I know how that embarrasses you even though it&#39;s completely legal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know why, I just don&#39;t like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with that monster dong you get a lot of attention around here. Did the doc say anything about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he said that I probably wouldn&#39;t stop growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn. You might need a wheelbarrow soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both laughed and finished up their day at the gym, Jen went home and looked at herself in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can handle being this.&quot; She said to herself, and went to bed with one thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder when I see Kyle again.&quot;</p>
