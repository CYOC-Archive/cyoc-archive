<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    A distorted mix of a hiss and growl resounds from the beast&#39;s maw as it awakens, nose twitching at the faint smell of blood while its tongue slips through its jaws, half of the tongue long and serpent-like, while the other half was similar to a dog&#39;s. It could almost <i>taste</i> the foul scent. <br />
<br />
    Its drowsy asymmetrical eyes ignore the blue scales and golden fur illuminated by the full moon above, whilst paying no mind to the scent of blood, instead opting to examine its unreasonably large member. Its left hand, scaled and smooth, lustfully fondles its large, warm furred orbs, while its right hand, furred and rough, gropes its feminine, plump, and smooth  scaled ass.<br />
<br />
    Its attempt to pleasure itself is interrupted as the faint rustling of grass and the crunching of underbrush reach its ears, along with the scent of live meat. It grins savagely, right eye glinting in primal lust as it&#39;s tongue lips its chops.<br />
<br />
    <i>Prey.</i><br />
<br />
    Rising up, the beast uses its claws to cut away the remains of a tattered old tunic and chainmail, throwing the tatters aside. Such articles of clothing weren&#39;t necessary for a being such as him. Crouching low, the beast stalks the source of the noise, panting in hunger. Peering from behind a tree, a smile carves into its mixed features, drool dripping down it&#39;s lower jaw.<br />
<br />
    A lone deer stood, grazing at the grass of the forest, blissfully unaware of the abomination watching its every movement. The ungulate&#39;s ears twitch, lifting it&#39;s head and freezing up at the sound of breaking underbrush. <br />
<br />
    Without time to react, the deer&#39;s muzzle opens in a silent cry. Blood trickles down its neck, a furry clawed hand plunged into it&#39;s throat. Withdrawing it, the beast pays no heed to the crimson staining its claws, more intrigued by the smell of fresh meat as the deer slumps over, dead.<br />
<br />
    Stumbling to its knees by the limp form of its prey, the jaws of the beast tear into the poor animal, eagerly consuming the raw flesh. Despite their asymmetrical shape, its fangs do little to hinder the meal, while the split tongue only seems to accentuate the meat&#39;s taste. Red liquid stains its lustrous golden fur and the green grass below. <br />
<br />
    The sound of tearing tendons and bones are music to it&#39;s ears, the scent of blood was <i>refreshing</i>. The raw meat… <i>Invigorating</i>... <br />
<br />
    Swallowing a final chunk of flesh, a satisfied rumble reverberates from his throat and stomach. Licking the remaining blood from his chops, the beastial hybrid stumbles away from the torn remains of the deer, the ungulate rendered unrecognizable from his ferociousness. Picking the bones from between his fangs, the beast drops to his knees. The primal and feral state ebbing away.<br />
<br />
    His gaze falls to the red stained fur of his right arm, before it switches back to the deer&#39;s carcass. The beast&#39;s jaw slowly drops open. Despite his eyes being completely different, both held the same emotion.<br />
<br />
    <i>Fear.</i><br />
<br />
    The beast&#39;s low and menacing breaths began to quicken, its stomach churning at the sight before it. A single tear drips from its blue serpentine eye, while the rage drains from its red beastial eye.<br />
<br />
    Bringing its hands up to its face, the beast&#39;s heart begins to race. It&#39;s left hand was blue and scaled, whilst it&#39;s right was gold and furred. It didn&#39;t make sense to it.<br />
<br />
    It didn&#39;t make sense to <i>him</i>.<br />
<br />
    Hyperventilating, his two hands rapidly clench and unclench, as if to test if what he was seeing was <i>real</i>. His gaze falls to his feet, one foot scaled and reptilian, the other furred and canine-like.<br />
<br />
    Blood squelches between his toes, and with that he catches glimpses at his twisted reflection. His left eye, reptilian and heartless. His right eye, feral and seething with rage.<br />
<br />
    Recoiling, the beast trips and tumbles to his back, the sight of the moon unable to calm him. His reflection…<br />
<br />
    It wasn&#39;t… <i>Him</i>...<br />
<br />
    Darkness begins to cloud his vision once again, the snake-wolf hybrid unable to think. The full moon becomes nothing but a faint orb of light as darkness consumes him.<br />
<br />
    ...<br />
<br />
    “<i>Wake up, son.</i>”<br />
<br />
    Kairos’ eyes fly open at the unusually commanding voice. It sounded deep and masculine, a fitting voice for someone such as <i>his</i> father. A beastly yawn from his throat causes his eyes to scrunch, before they open to reveal a large grey furred wolf standing above him. The full moon continues to bathe the forest in it&#39;s luster, although a hint of dawn tinges the sky. He hadn&#39;t been out for long.<br />
<br />
    Extending his right hand, Kairos’ werewolf father helps his dazed son to his feet. Chuckling, Kairos’ father pats his son&#39;s back, the golden wolf groaning.<br />
<br />
    “You know son, there are far better places to nap than on the ground.” The beast&#39;s right eye gazes at his father, before Kairos himself breaks into a faint laughter. His father&#39;s gaze falls to the deer before them, blood stained the grass and it&#39;s thick scent filled the air.<br />
<br />
    “My, my. Your first catch as a werewolf son. You&#39;re making me proud. But you&#39;ve made quite the mess of yourself.” Kairos glances down at the dry blood coating his fur, nervously chuckling.<br />
<br />
    “Is Daddy going to have to clean you up with his tongue?” Kairos freezes before sighing at the laughter his father derives from the joke. Although the hybrid felt rather <i>put off</i> by the entire situation. <br />
<br />
    “And look how much of a naughty boy you are! Not a shred of clothing is covering your manliness! Can&#39;t say I&#39;m disappointed though.” His father grins pervertedly as his son attempts to cover his junk with his hands.<br />
<br />
    “You know, son, my first transformation into a werewolf was quite arousing too. There&#39;s no need to be embarrassed over some father-son bonding.” Another pat to his back causes Kairos to look up to his werewolf father, a grin coming across his own face.<br />
<br />
    “I understand how difficult it can be to keep your instincts in check. But the key to not becoming feral is to keep your emotions balanced.” His father points a clawed finger to his head for emphasis. “To be in control of the beast, the beast must be in control of you.”<br />
<br />
    Kairos’ head tilts quizzically, uncomprehending. “That… Doesn&#39;t make much sense father. I&#39;m right here acting just like myself <i>and</i> I&#39;m a werewolf. What&#39;s your point?” His father&#39;s joyful face turns stern, his hand dropping to his shoulder. The older lupine shakes his head.<br />
<br />
    “You&#39;re already letting arrogance consume you. If you have too much humanity, you&#39;ll completely take over and reverse the transformation. But if you&#39;re weak willed, the mind of the beast will overtake you, rendering you feral and primal.” His father&#39;s golden eyes bore into his own. “The latter tends to occur much more often. You&#39;ll succumb to your pleasure and die a beast.”<br />
<br />
    Kairos’ gaze falls back to his clawed feet, shuffling them in slight anxiousness at the old wolf&#39;s words. Clearly they were not to be ignored. Was that why he felt off?<br />
<br />
    “I&#39;m surprised you have such little knowledge in the legends of our kind. After all the readings we&#39;ve done?” Kairos’ head tilts in <br />
curiosity of his father&#39;s words. Then his eyes light up in realization. Glancing around the open clearing, his sharpened eyesight falls upon a large brown book laying a few feet away.<br />
<br />
    Scrambling over to grab it, his father gazes on in interest. A smile crosses Kairos’ beastial face as he holds up the book. His father&#39;s gaze follows him as he trots back over to him, the book in his clawed hands. A thoughtful grin crosses both lupine&#39;s maws, his father bringing a clawed finger to his cheek.<br />
<br />
    “You were carrying that thing around with you the entire time? Guess it fell out of your bag didn&#39;t it?” Kairos sheepishly nods, his eyes looking away in a flustered manner. Both lupines sink to the ground, sitting on the moist forest grass. Kairos scoots closer to his father, placing the book in between their laps. <br />
<br />
    “You&#39;re awfully eager to go through these old legends,” his father remarks in interest, although he cracks a warm smile, “but on the bright side, at least I know you&#39;re still human in there somewhere.” Both werewolves gaze into each other&#39;s eyes, the golden wolf reassured by his father&#39;s golden eyes.<br />
<br />
    “Before we get into reading this old thing,” his father pats the book, “do you remember the legend of this world?” <br />
<br />
    <i>...This is going to sound incredibly bizarre, but do you remember the legend of this world?</i><br />
<br />
    Kairos glances quizzically at his father, before falling into silence and diverting his gaze to his feet out of shame. A hand on his shoulder causes him to look up once again to the warm face of his father. <br />
<br />
     “I suppose the strain of your transformation and the flood of new instincts dealt quite the blow to your head.” His father solemnly admits. “But it&#39;s natural. When you change back you&#39;ll remember, but it doesn&#39;t hurt for a quick refresher.” Kairos smiled eagerly as his father opens the leather book, careful not to tear the pages with his claws.<br />
<br />
    Bewilderment fills both werewolves faces as countless pages were stained with long dried blood, the red color having become a dull red, almost brownish color. Flipping through more pages, his father growls darkly. <br />
<br />
    The book falls from his beastial hands, tumbling away, landing perfectly on it&#39;s binding before falling to it&#39;s cover.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Father</i>?” Kairos yells, recoiling in shock as his father suddenly rises from the ground, before pacing around his son.<br />
<br />
    “Do you truly think that low of me, <i>son</i>?” The golden wolf flinches at the sudden harsh tone of his father&#39;s voice, dripping with scorn. He stifles a gasp as his father suddenly lay eye level with him. His once warm golden eyes, dull and cold.<br />
<br />
    <b><i>SMACK</i></b><br />
<br />
    Kairos’ head flinches back as his father&#39;s large hand strikes the left half of his face.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Do you</i>?” Fear fills Kairos’ eyes, on instinct he glances away, only angering his father more. The lupine rises up, the silence causing Kairos to gulp. The elder werewolf turns around and paces away, keeping his back to his son as he stops.<br />
<br />
    A sickening squelch echoes throughout the clearing. Kairos’ right eye widens in shock as he sees his father&#39;s fur begin to peel off. His serpentine left eye fills with unexplainable dread as deathly pale, white scales reveal from beneath the warm furred exterior of a father he&#39;d never had.<br />
<br />
    Turning around, both eyes fill with fear as the werewolf&#39;s golden eyes were no longer gold, or distinctly round.<br />
<br />
    His father&#39;s eyes were slit and red, bloodshot and wild with madness. Bringing his scaled reptilian arm to his face, the werewolf begins to tear himself apart, strands of fur being ripped away with not a drop of blood shed.<br />
<br />
    In the once fatherly wolfman&#39;s place stood a lean white scaled lizardman, the white colored scales pale as death beneath the moonlight. The serpent begins to rapidly breathe in fear as the imposing figure of his father gains distance with every step.<br />
<br />
    “F-Father I-”<br />
<br />
    Another smack knocks the snakeman to the ground, the blue serpent cupping his cheek as it stings from the blow. Kairos flinches as his lizard father rears his hand back for another strike.<br />
<br />
    Yet it falls to his side, a dark, condescending smirk plastered on his father&#39;s reptilian maw. Kairos slit eye glances around wildly as three robed figures step out from behind the trees, reptilian maws poking from their hoods while their clawed hands held tomes, an eye-like symbol faintly visible on each book&#39;s cover.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Worthless</i>!” Spittle flies from Kairos’ mouth as his lizardman elder strikes him again, sending him to the ground. Wiping his mouth, the blue scaled serpent gets to his knees, but keeps his head to the ground. He stifles a yell as his father smashes his clawed foot onto his left hand, the claws clenching and driving into his smooth vulnerable scales.<br />
<br />
    “Nothing but a hindrance to our plans, calling <i>you</i> my son is an insult.” The lizardman tears his foot from the serpentman&#39;s hand. Kairos’ eye fail to catch that no blood spills from the wound. <br />
<br />
    A twisted grin crosses his father&#39;s face however, making his scales stand up on end. <br />
<br />
    “Don&#39;t worry though, as with everything, you can still be <i>saved</i>.” With those words, the hooded lizardmen begin chanting in an unusual tongue as the white scaled reptile leans down to his son, his red eyes staring into the singular blue eye filled with fear.<br />
<br />
    A shocked hiss slips from the depths of Kairos’ throat as his father suddenly brings him to his feet, his father&#39;s clawed hands digging into his shoulders. <br />
<br />
    Unable to tear his gaze away, the blue scaled snakeman was forced to stare into the demented eyes of his father.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Light and darkness. Without them, this world has fallen to ruin</i>.” His father grins wildly as he recites the words. <br />
<br />
    “<i>Light</i>,” One of the hooded figures remarks calmly, the tome in it&#39;s hands radiating a calming light.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Darkness</i>,” Another whispers, the shadows around them beginning to tremble as a spine chilling energy fills the grove.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Chaos</i>,” The final hooded reptile points to Kairos, it&#39;s eyes glinting in scorn as it clutches the book in it&#39;s palms. <br />
<br />
    “and <i>Order</i>.” His father spits, digging his claws into the snakeman&#39;s back. “A concept long forgotten by our world.” Frozen by fear, the serpent can do nothing as the lizardman brings his jaws next to his ear. “Together, we can bring order back.”<br />
<br />
    “<i>Order…?</i>” Kairos stares into the expanse of the forest, his father&#39;s words sounded unbearably convincing.<br />
<br />
    <i>But what did they mean?</i><br />
<br />
    His father withdraws his maw from his ear, the lizardman continuing to firmly clasp his shoulders. The hooded figures glance at him, as if awaiting a confirmation. Not averting his gaze from Kairos’ eyes, the reptile merely nods.<br />
<br />
    The three hooded lizardmen walk towards each other and stand behind their white scaled leader, each holding out their tomes. The rightmost lizardman began to shine with a white luster, his slit eyes shining with light. The space around the leftmost one began to grow darker than even the shadows around him, before deep crimson patterns began to tear their way through his scales. The center lizardman did not glow or radiate darkness, instead giving a nod to his cohorts.<br />
<br />
    The hooded figures at both his sides angle their tomes towards him. The light from the right figure collects at his hand and forms into a perfect sphere of energy. The darkness from the left figure slithers down to his arm, crawling onto the pages of the tome before forming into an unstable ball of magic.<br />
<br />
    The center lizardman&#39;s tome floats from his hands, levitating above him as it&#39;s pages flip rhythmically. Shutting his eyes, the cloaked being&#39;s scaled hands rise to his forehead, pulsing with energy. His middle and index fingers connect to form into a diamond like shape, the energy in his hands forming into a small orb between them; an eye.<br />
<br />
    “<i>I open my third eye</i>.”<br />
<br />
    The two figures that held the pulsing masses of light and darkness fire them at their cohort’s hands, the mixing of both energies forming an even larger orb just in front of him.<br />
<br />
    Releasing his grip, the red eyed lizardman turns to his followers before walking over with his hands outstretched. Taking the mass of mixed energy from the center hooded figure, he turns back to the blue serpentman, a mad grin spread across his face.<br />
<br />
    “<i>With chaos eradicated and light and darkness merged back to one, this war will be put to rest, and in its place will lie a peaceful world filled with order.</i>” <br />
<br />
    Kairos’ gaze falls to the orb of swirling colors. The light intertwined with darkness was as calming as it was disturbing. It was unusually reflective despite being a mass of energy, as if it was a liquid like substance.<br />
<br />
    A glimpse of his reflection causes Kairos to stumble back, his balance suddenly uneven. The white scaled lizardman shakes his head in disappointment.<br />
<br />
    “A disappointment to the very end. By embracing this gift you&#39;ll…” <br />
<br />
    His father&#39;s words fade, both his and Kairos’ eyes widening as the mass of energy begins to fade away, the light and dark power consuming itself before nothing remains. Cursing, his father spins around towards the hooded figures, eyes filled with anger.<br />
<br />
    Yet there were no figures to turn to. The three lizardmen had completely vanished.<br />
<br />
    But in their place stands a woman, her long flowing platinum blonde hair held back by a bandana. Her grey eyes stare in pity at the white scaled lizardfolk before her, before they fall to the half-reptilian, half-canine beast behind him, it&#39;s eyes wide in shock.<br />
<br />
    Kairos’ jaw quivers, both of his eyes reflecting the same emotion.<br />
<br />
    “<i>Verve</i>.”<br />
<br />
    “And how will this reunification of light and darkness <i>truly</i> turn out? Will it end in a world without any strife or struggles? A world where all can carve and decide their own paths? Or a world ruled by tyrants such as <i>you</i>?” Verve&#39;s grey eyes bore through the lizardman&#39;s own, the reptile unable to retort out of shock.<br />
<br />
    The faint light of the sun trickles through the thick canopy of branches above, morning dew dripping from the leaves above. As the light of dawn reaches the lizardman, he begins to fade away, before nothing remains.<br />
<br />
    As Verve walks towards him, the white armor covering her form reflects the soft glow of the sun. Kneeling to her old student, a warm smile crosses her lips as she caresses the left side of his face, the warmness from her hand relieving the pain his scales had felt moments earlier.<br />
<br />
     Her other hand glides up to the right side of his face, her grey eyes seeing her old student not as a beast, but a mere boy.<br />
<br />
    “<i>You can take off the disguise, Kairos</i>.” <br />
<br />
    Kairos flinches as her hands wrap around his own, before guiding the asymmetrical hands to his face.<br />
<br />
    Tears well up in the beast&#39;s eyes as the woman in white rises up, her form beginning to shimmer. Gazing solemnly at Kairos, a slight smile crosses her lips before she fades away.<br />
<br />
    An overwhelming feeling of determination crosses Kairos, both of his eyes burning with resolve. Clenching his hands at his face, he begins to pull at the blue scales and golden fur.<br />
<br />
    But what greets him isn&#39;t the sound of tearing flesh or immense pain, but the feeling of fresh air against his face.<br />
<br />
    His human face.</p>
