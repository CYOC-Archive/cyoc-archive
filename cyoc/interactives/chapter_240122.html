<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen walked down the stairs to the kitchen, wondering who Kyle would change into when she heard what should be her mother&#39;s singing in the kitchen. But the voice was the one that she had just spoken with on the phone. She stopped and looked at the pictures on the wall, Kyle having replaced her mother in all of them. How? Kyle didn&#39;t know her mother unless....<br />
<br />
“Are you okay honey?” Kyle&#39;s mom pleaded with him, “You fainted.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah...” Kyle said slowly, the voice coming from his mouth was familiar, “I&#39;m okay, I just got out of bed too fast.” <br />
<br />
“You should be more careful, are you okay to go to school?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I can do it.” He said sitting up, he felt the weight on his chest shift, he acted natural, he&#39;d get a look at himself in a minute. He knew this voice, but he wasn&#39;t sure it was her just yet.<br />
<br />
“Okay, just be careful today.” He mother got up and walked to the kitchen. “I&#39;ve got breakfast ready, get dressed and come out here.”<br />
<br />
Kyle sat for a minute and looked down, the full breasts now sitting on his chest were a pair he&#39;d dreamed of seeing naked. He got up, he noticed he was taller, and walked over to his mirror and gasped. “No... not her... why her?” In the mirror was a slim, busty blonde woman, mostly naked except for the now tight pair of boxer briefs that strained against her larger body. He was now in the body of Mrs. Sandra Smith, his psychiatrist, he watched as her movements mirror his. “This is so fucked up....” He&#39;d fantasized about the busty blonde doctor, wondering if she had unintentionally become a doctor on her way through a modeling career. He&#39;d even beat off to the thought of her, had wet dreams of her too, and now he was her. “I can&#39;t do this....”<br />
<br />
Kyle shivered for a moment, then sighed and started to get dressed. He found that his new body stood taller than his, his face was at level with her bust, and he&#39;d always tried not to look at her breasts. She stood at five feet and eight inches tall, he had stood at just five feet. He sat on the bed and started to pull on his jeans, he&#39;d worn baggy jeans most of the time, but the thick thighs of the doctor forced him to nearly stuff himself into them. Pulling them up he heard them make a popping noise as they struggled to contain his new wider hips, he looked down and saw the jeans struggling to contain his new luscious thighs, he wondered if he could button his pants at all. He managed to zip and button his jeans, finding them to barely contain his new hips, he stood up and felt the cuffs pull up his calves, looking down he saw his jeans now looked like a pair of fitted capris, showing much more leg than he would want. He walked over and went to get a pair of socks, finding they had been replaced with calf length socks, he wondered why and went over to his closet.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a band shirt, pulled it on and spent a few minutes trying to fit himself into it, his XL sized shirt hugged his new body tightly, leaving little to the imagination, struggling to contain his new bust. He went to get his shoes and stopped, the curse had replaced his socks and shoes for a reason, it seemed that his doctor liked a certain style of heels. All of his shoes had been replaced with thigh high boots with a three inch heel, he grabbed a pair, trying not to get upset, and slipped his new feet into his new heels, adjusting them to slip under the cuffs of his pants and zipping them. “At least their not stilettos.” He sighed in her voice, “I&#39;m gonna have to get used to hearing you now.” He got up and grabbed his backpack, walking out to the hall with uncertain steps in his new heels, he felt his unrestrained breasts bounce with each step.<br />
<br />
“Ready for school?” His mom asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I&#39;m good.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Now,” She turned and looked at his breasts. “Eat up, the bus will be here soon.” <br />
<br />
Kyle felt awkward, his mother staring at his new bust and talking to it was expected because of the curse, but he wasn&#39;t ready for it to actually happen. Kyle sat down and heard his jeans make a light popping noise again, he looked to see if she would notice but she continued with what she had been doing. Kyle ate and then got up to go to school, his mother stopped him, giving him a kiss on his chest where his forehead should have been and let him go to school.<br />
<br />
On the bus he talked with Jarred as usual, trying not to show that anything was different as Jarred kept staring at his breasts. He wondered if Mrs. Smith was doing well in his body, then remembered that she&#39;d not notice it at all. He got off the bus and saw Jen, she looked mad, he walked toward the school and she stopped him.<br />
<br />
“You....” She tried to stop staring into his bust. “You and you stupid fetish! That&#39;s my mom&#39;s body! Give it back!”<br />
<br />
Kyle stared at her, the last name finally connected, Jen&#39;s mom was his psychiatrist, the middle aged busty blonde did bear a resemblance to her daughter, how could he not connect the two before now. Kyle smiled, he thought about how he could use this to his advantage. He wobbled his new breasts at her, making her uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
“Now...” He used his new voice to sound like a porn actress. “What makes you think that I&#39;ll give up mommies&#39; body.” He cooed, enjoying making her uncomfortable while deciding what to do.<br />
<br />
“You fucking pervert.” She blushed, unable to move her eyes off his breasts, the she had never said she wouldn&#39;t be affected by it. Kyle stood there for a minute, feeling awkward but triumphant, then he started to talk.</p>
