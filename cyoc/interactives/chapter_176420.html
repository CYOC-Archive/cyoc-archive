<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan and Shane walked to the nearby restaurant they had planned on going to earlier. It was a small, quiet place as not many people stopped their durring the day since it was mostly used as a bar at night. But Shane apparently knew the owner&#39;s family as her and their daughter had been friends since highschool. Even more so, she would often get free meals there since she would help out from time to time whenever it was extra busy for free. <br />
<br />
When they entered the building, the tall man behind the bar greeted them with a frendly expression on his face. &quot;Good afternoon Shane, just sit down anywhere that&#39;s open. I&#39;ll send Millie over in a bit to take your orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mr. Watson, we&#39;ll just be right over there next to the window&quot; replied Shane as she guided Ryan over to the booth. By the time they sat down, the man, Mr. Watson, had already disappeared from behind the bar. No less than a minute later did a girl around 2-3 years younger than Shane begin walking over to the table. &quot;OMG Shane! I like, haven&#39;t seen you in over a week! It was starting to get like, sooooo boring in here without seeing you around. Like, I get that this is mainly a bar and stuff, but like, seriously, it is just so~ sucky when I am by myself. At least I make like, a ton of money from tips when by myself. Anyways, so like, who&#39;s your hot lady friend over there? You two out on a date or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Millie, this is my girlfriend Ryan. Ryan, this is my best friend, Millie&quot; introduced Shane. <br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way! She is your girlfriend! Since when! Why am I only hearing about her now? Cone on, move over.&quot; Millie, who was supposedly the waitress, was now pushing Shane over so she could sit down with them. Ryan felt a little bit awkward, but since it was only the 2 of them and a few customers sitting at the bar, it likely was fine for a minute or so. At least, Mr. Watson seemed to not really care too much as he simply rolled his eyes whike shaking his head when he watched his daughter take a seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Tell me everything. Have you fucked yet?&quot; Asked Millie who now was very excited and speaking rather loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Millie!&quot; Shouted her father from the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, Sorry Daddy&quot; apologized Millie. Then in a much quieter voice she repeated her question. &quot;So like seriously. How far have you two gone? I like, haven&#39;t seen you in over a week and now you drop like, the biggest news bomb from outta nowhere on me. You better not leave out any details either, or like, I will be like, super pissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuckling quietly, Shane tries her best to explain the recent timeline of events that happened today. Ryan mostly just let the girls catch up a bit and simply answered where he felt that he could. His opinion of Millie was quickly forming at the same time. She clearly was one of those types of girls. The kind who love gossiping, and come off initially as either an airhead or just dumb. But this wasn&#39;t the entire case for Millie. <br />
<br />
As they talked, Ryan was surprised to find that Millie was actually insainly smart, and that she just had adopted this outward image because she could have a lot more fun that way when socializing. Apparently, durring her freshman year, and just a few months before she met Shane, who was a Junior at the time, Millie had just moved to the area. And upon entering school, the first group of girls who she just happened to meet were the surprisingly stereotypical, airheaded bimbo cheerleaders. And after hanging around them for a while once they had become friends, she at some point had unknowingly adopted their way of speaking, dressing, acting and socializing. The only difference was that Millie was her grade&#39;s valedictorian, while they were more or less ranked the lowest of all of her class mates. A big falling out happened between them because of it, and now they rarely speak to each other. That was around when Millie had met Shane and the two have been best friends ever since. Honestly, it was not what Ryan was expecting to hear, and certainly not how he expected his date with Shane to play out. <br />
<br />
Millie stuck around for about another 15 minutes until her father signaled her to finally get back to work. &quot;Well, I have been like sooo third wheeling your date. So I&#39;m goinna get back to work before Daddy gets mad.&quot; After sliding out of the booth, Millie stood up and it was as if a switch had been flipped. She suddenly started acting like a perfectly normal waitress. &quot;Well, may I take your orders ladies? Or do you need another minute?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan was a little taken aback by her sudden formality, and impersonalization.  However Shane acted as if it was normal amd simply ordered her food. &quot;And what can I get for you Miss?&quot; asked Millie towards Ryan. He then ordered his food, all while feeling a bit awkward. Once Millie left, Shane quickly explained it to him. &quot;Millie does that in order to hide her bimbo accent and sound more professional. It took her a lot of practice in order to be able to flip it on and off at a moments notice. The trade off is that she can only do it with a few certain sentances she learned to use in order to be a waitress, so don&#39;t let it bother you too much.&quot; <br />
<br />
They continued to chat in peace until their food was brought out by Millie. After Millie had handed it out and had left them again, Ryan went to grab his knife when suddenly the salt shaker tipped over seemingly by itself. &quot;Huh, that was odd&quot; he commented as he went to pick it up, only to watch as the plate with his food on it, start to push forward. &quot;Ok what is happening?&quot; He whispered to Shane, who was doing her best to not burst out laughing. &quot;Its your boobs Ryan. You keep hitting things with your tits.&quot; To Ryan, he still looked normal, but now it seemed that not only could he feel his boob&#39;s weight, but they could now also interact with the world. He essentially now had invisible breasts. Crossing over his legs to the inverse, Ryan straightened up and carefully tried his best to not hit anything with his breasts. After a few times, he finally managed to get a feel for their real size, and was able to eat normally without hitting anything for the rest of their meal.</p>
