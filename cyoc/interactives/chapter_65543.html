<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monday morning is usually a drag for me… But not THIS Monday morning! Ever since I discovered my cool new powers and I found out how easily I could make Dustin become younger and how it was a piece of cake to add over forty pounds of muscle to my own body, I figured I could just have myself a ball at school this morning! <br />
<br />
Not only could I go to school and show off my titanic muscles, but I figured if I could grow my own muscles, then surely I could grow those muscles of all my friends and classmates as well! That would be such a trip. I decided to have some fun with my new abilities during every period that I had class that day, and to pick my victims from the guys in each class I had for every period of the day.<br />
<br />
My first period on Monday morning was study hall, which meant that we could just work on our homework assignments and catch up on our reading. That was great, since I could scope out the dudes in the classroom and decide who to hulk out. Since we only had about fifteen people in that class, finding a good target was very easy to do.<br />
<br />
I took a seat in the far back of the classroom, giving me a bird’s-eye view of everyone in the room. I could see who was short, skinny, fat, or tall. From all the people in the room, I could easily pick the best victim to grow. From there, I could sit back and watch as I made my wish and observe, as the hopeless victim would slowly grow bigger and more muscular, without realizing what was going on or why.<br />
<br />
I unzipped by backpack and pulled out a book to read, and I began to read a page or two until it became really quiet in the room. That was when I stopped to look up so I could evaluate my classmates in the room. Chuck was in front of me, but he was rather muscular already. Steve was to my left, and he was short and chubby, so that was a possibility. Then there was Stan, who wore glasses and shorts, sitting to my right. He was short and skinny and he looked a little bit like a geek. I could pick between Steve and Stan. I knew that I had Steve in other classes as well, so I could always change him later, so I decided to go with Stan.<br />
<br />
I studied Stanley’s body, which was easy since I was sitting right next to him. Stan had dirty blond hair and small glasses, with blue eyes. He wore a black t-shirt and brown shorts and white sneakers. He was skinny to the bone and he just looked very, very average.<br />
<br />
“Hey, umm… Stan! Can I borrow your pencil?” I asked him.<br />
<br />
“Oh… sure, Ty!” he replied, as he took the pencil on his desk and handed it to me. Stan had several pencils on his desk and he had no problem sharing them with me.<br />
<br />
I then glanced over and scanned his thoughts. I found out that Stan got bullied quite often in school, and I wanted to help him out, especially since he was a bit of a geek.<br />
<br />
“Hey Stan… Did you ever wish… you were stronger… than you are now?” I asked him carefully.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Sometimes… But that takes hours and hours of lifting weights and working out in the gym… That’s not gonna happen anytime soon….” Stan sighed, as he tried to concentrate on his book.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t hold back anymore. I looked around the rest of the room, and I silently wished that nobody else would notice any changes that would happen to Stan. Then, I turned back and concentrated on Stan once more. Finally, I silently wished for Stan to gain about fifty pounds of muscle, which would be evenly distributed over his entire body. I wanted the growth to be sudden and fast, but without Stan noticing anything.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Stan’s pectorals pushed outward and sideways from his chest, practically ripping out of his t-shirt. At the same time, Stan’s biceps inflated to the point where they became as big and as hard as bowling balls, tearing the sleeves of his shirt as well. His flat stomach now morphed into a landscape of ridges as washboard abs surfaced over his torso, consisting of rows and columns of muscle. His entire torso became wider while the muscles on his back and shoulders and neck grew as well. <br />
<br />
Next, his calves inflated like balloons as the muscles grew ever so much bigger, until they were as round as soccer balls. His quads then bulged as well, becoming bigger and wider due to new layers of muscle piling up on top of each other, forming on the legs above the knees. Within moments, the boy’s legs were wider than tree trunks, and they were harder than steel!<br />
<br />
I looked on and smiled as I watched Stan’s body pile on the muscles. When the growth stopped, I silently wished only for Stan to notice the changes, but everyone else in the classroom would find his remarkable muscle growth spurt to be completely normal.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the geeky dude stopped reading from his book. He flexed his mighty arms and gasped in silence, as he saw his bulging biceps while he felt the surge in strength coursing through his body.<br />
<br />
I quickly wished for all his clothes to fit his new, enlarged body. Stan’s shirt and shorts quickly grew and repaired themselves, so that everything fit again.<br />
<br />
Stan looked down and examined his chest, followed by his mighty legs. At first, the boy was completely lost for words explaining where the muscles came from, but I just glanced at him with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you’re looking great, Stan!” I said to him.<br />
<br />
“Huh? I do? I mean…”<br />
<br />
“You’ve been working out, huh?” I grinned.<br />
<br />
“Well… Uhh… “<br />
<br />
I was very happy with Stan. Nobody would ever pick on him again. Mission accomplished.<br />
<br />
Just then the bell rang for the period to end and for me to pack my stuff into my backpack so that I could go to my next class in room 112: English! Who would I grow in there?</p>
