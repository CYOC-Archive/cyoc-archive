<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael had bad feelings all day in school. He couldn’t get through his classes without thinking about all of the problems he had been having. His teachers had noticed and began to call him out for not paying attention in class. This was unlike him, they would say. It was. Out of the two of them, Michael was the better student. Based on his performance today, it’d be hard for an outside observer to see that.<br />
<br />
As fate would have it, the school had a fire alarm drill and all of the students had to evacuate from their respective classes. Michael joined a barrage of teenagers as they exited to the front lawn of their school. Set amongst a quiet, sleepy neighborhood, the outside, normally deserted save for the occasionally birds in the trees, was chock full of students waiting to head back inside. <br />
<br />
As Michael stood outside with the entire student body, his friend, Diya, approached him from the crowd. <br />
<br />
“Hi Michael” she called to him as she came to give him a hug. <br />
<br />
“Hi Diya” Michael replied as he tried to show a smile, but lying under it was a bit of sadness. <br />
<br />
“I can tell something’s up. Talk to me. What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“It’s about Freddy. I’m worried about him. I have a bad feeling something’s happening to him.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I happen to be a person who believes in spiritual guidance, as you already know. If you feel something this strongly, you really ought to follow it. It might be a warning.”<br />
<br />
“But I’m nervous about skipping school and I can’t just say that I’m sick. How do I get out classes to sneak over to see him?”<br />
<br />
“I have an idea.”<br />
<br />
Diya pulled out her phone and opened up an app that had a picture of a skull and a red backdrop. If Michael was good with computers, Diya was an A+ genius. She had high ambitions in life, likely to end up at one of the most elite universities in the country. Playing around with some settings, Diya found what she was looking for. <br />
<br />
At the tap of a button, the fire alarm system blared louder than ever before, and soon, all of the students could see the sprinkler system acting up. The faculty and teachers were in a state of panic while the students cheered and applauded. <br />
<br />
“Go” Diya said to Michael as she placed a hand on his shoulder and turned him towards the neighborhood. “This will likely get classes cancelled for the rest of the day, so you don’t have to worry about coming back. If they dismiss us, I’ll sign you out electronically.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, Diya” Michael responded. “How did you manage to pull that off.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. Just go.”<br />
<br />
Diya pushed him off as Michael briefly turned around to nod with the first genuine smile she had seen in a number of days. With a renewed sense of gratitude, but overcrowded by a deep sense of dread, Michael began to run off and head towards the scene of where he suspected trouble would be. <br />
<br />
As he ran through the neighborhood, he passed by Freddy’s house. Outside, he saw Freddy’s mother on her phone looking panicked and worried. <br />
<br />
“This is a bad sign” Michael thought to himself.<br />
<br />
He would have kept going, had it not been for Freddy’s mother spotting him and calling him to come over. Nervously walking towards her, Michael saw that Freddy’s mother got off the phone and looked up at him. <br />
<br />
“Have you seen Freddy?” Freddy’s mother asked.<br />
<br />
“No” Michael responded. “He should have been home here with you. When’s the last time you saw him?”<br />
<br />
“Earlier this morning. I made him breakfast and then I asked him if I could go for a brief ten minute walk and he said yes. So, I got my things together and…”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what!?”<br />
<br />
“I was only out for ten minutes, Michael.”<br />
<br />
Michael slapped himself on the head and groaned out in exasperation. <br />
<br />
“I knew I shouldn’t have left him alone” Freddy’s mother continued. “And in hindsight, I wish I hadn’t, but you have to realize how tough it is to be stuck inside all day when all you want to do is go out and get some fresh air.”<br />
<br />
“Well, why didn’t you just step out in the yard?”<br />
<br />
“Because Ellie has been acting up lately and there isn’t really enough room to stretch out your legs.”<br />
<br />
“Well, why didn’t you ask him to go with you?”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother took a moment to think about this before realizing that Michael was right. She’d never admit it to him, but she didn’t have to. The look on her face said it all, causing Michael to slap himself on the forehead. <br />
<br />
“Oh man….” Michael groaned aloud.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he hasn’t gotten off too far” Freddy’s mother added, trying to make a positive spin on a bad situation. <br />
<br />
As they stood in silence, Michael had a hunch. He had a feeling he was right, but he couldn’t let Freddy’s mother know. Not considering how dangerous it could be. <br />
<br />
“I have an idea” Michael said. “I’m going to go home and look something up. I’ll be by later if I either find Freddy or Fido…or if I don’t have any leads.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, dear” Freddy’s mother replied. “Stay safe.”<br />
<br />
Although Freddy’s mother was going to ask why Michael was home so early from school, she decided against it; knowing that she had made a major mistake and that he might be key to getting her son back. She’d have to hold her tongue. <br />
<br />
Michael raced down several blocks, passing by his own house, which was empty, before making his way to the block where he suspected Freddy was now. Upon turning a corner, he spotted the house that he suspected the wizard purchased. In a complete contrast from yesterday, there was no signs that this had been a moving in site just yesterday. It looked like an ordinary house, albeit older and fading. <br />
<br />
Composing himself, Michael moved to the front door as he sensed something was wrong. Upon getting to the door, he heard noises inside. <br />
<br />
“That’s it” the voice said. “Who’s a good boy?”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!’ Michael thought to himself. “Freddy must have been lured here and that’s why he was missing. I have to get in there and rescue him.”<br />
<br />
Foregoing formalities, Michael took the door knob and proceeded to open it with all his might. He was surprisingly able to do it, only to discover Sofya on top of Freddy, having her way with him.<br />
<br />
“No!” Michael said with a mix of shock and sadness in his voice. <br />
<br />
Hearing Michael’s voice, Freddy found the strength to push Sofya off him and ran to Miichael as fur began to sprout over his hands. <br />
<br />
“Michael help me!” Freddy yelled as he ran out of the house. <br />
<br />
“Freddy?” Michael called as he watched Freddy running out of the house, his shock and sadness replaced with confusion. <br />
<br />
“Freddy wait!” Sofya yelled after him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no you don’t.”<br />
<br />
Michael ran out the door and shut it tight. Sofya tried to budge it open from the other end, but couldn’t get it to move as long as Michael held it back. Running out of strength, Michael scoured the neighborhood before he heard a rustling in the bushes. <br />
<br />
“That must be Freddy” Michael thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Michael let go of the door and jumped into the nearby bush as he landed on top of a furry object below him.<br />
<br />
“Freddy!” Michael yelled to him as he saw him on the ground.<br />
<br />
Michael pushed Freddy into a less branch filled area of the bush.<br />
<br />
“What the hell was going on in there?”<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy responded. “Please help me take off my clothes.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me what was happening in there.”<br />
<br />
“Later.”<br />
<br />
Freddy could feel fur sprouting everywhere. Michael could see it growing on Freddy’s body as well.<br />
<br />
“Huurreeth” Freddy slurred out as he began to lose his speech. “Weesshh taallkkk laateerrr.”<br />
<br />
Resigning himself to this fate, Michael helped maneuver a shapeshifting Freddy out of his shirt, pulled down his pants and chucked off his underwear. Michael immediately noticed Freddy….or rather Fido’s…sheath with its large, red dick exposed. Freddy, in a sense of lust, began to contract his penis in Michael’s direction, turned on by a mix of sex and fear. <br />
<br />
Soon, Freddy’s human features were blurred away as his hands and feet became paws and his tail stuck out, starting to tickle Michael’s crotch area. Freddy’s face disappeared as Fido’s furry dog head appeared again. Michael grabbed Fido from behind his furry back and rolled him over onto his front. Fido stood up on four legs once more. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Freddy. We’re going to get you out of here now and then, when you’ve masturbated yourself back into being human, we’re going to talk about this. Understand?”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded in acknowledgement, not wanting to make any noise.<br />
<br />
Before the two of them could get up to leave, they spotted someone trying to pull apart the bush. When Fido and Michael looked up, they could see…</p>
