<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam and Taylor just looked dumbfounded first at their now scale covered feet and at their friends who had become a mermaid and a merman. <br />
<br />
“Sorry about just making you into merfolk but my race soon to be your race too is dying thanks to human pollution and turning humans to replace the ones we lost is what the council of Atlantis has decided.” Said the green haired mermaid as Taylor looked at her foot again. <br />
She tried to turn around and run for help to escape this scene but her legs decided at that moment to fuse at that ankle causing her to fall backwards into the sand. Reacting on instincts she reached out and grabbed Sam by the shoulders, he was off balance as well and both fell into the sand.  <br />
<br />
She and Sam landed flat on their backs looking upwards into the bright sun, wincing their eyes they sat back up. Taylor looking down at her fused ankle only to see that the rest of her legs where still human but from the ankles her flesh was stretching out another foot or so as she heard bones snap and twist within her. It wasn’t painful at all which was weird, she watched as her toes grew out, spreading apart as they did and to needle like points of scale covered flesh before a thinner membrane until it was clearly the end of a tail. Her flesh down there quickly changed from the tan she had working on to a mixture of different shades of purple. <br />
<br />
“What a lovely color.” She said out load even as she shook her head grabbing the side with one of her hands as she watched her feet from the ankle down finish transforming into a purple mermaid tail. She should be freaking out, should be screaming her head off but she wasn’t. She turned her gaze toward Sam and her heart sank<br />
<br />
Sam was freaking out, but the short hair Sam had since his days on the high school football team was gone, instead long black smooth curls framed a face which looked a lot like Sam but a Sam which she had never meet before. His jaw line where he had been trying to grow a beard was now smooth and hairless, his eyes where full and his Adam’s apple was gone, his lips where full and his eyes while still dark now had perfectly manicured eyelashes on them. He reminded her of one of those movie stars from the 1920s or the like. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Sam in a smooth sexy clearly female voice as a pair of breasts began to bud from under his black T-shirt. Taylor reached over and grabbed onto him even as his shoulders narrowed as his frame began to turn from the strong former wide receiver he had been in high school to something much more different but just as sexy.<br />
<br />
Out in the water both Rose and Nate where confused as they looked at Shelly, they hadn’t expected to see Sam become a mermaid even if he was quickly becoming a drop dead beautiful women from the waste up. <br />
<br />
“The transformation can cause gender change.” Answered Shelly “My own mother used to be a man on a fishing boat which was transformed.”<br />
<br />
They nodded and turned back to watch as the purple scales began their march up Taylor’s legs as they fused. While Sam was transforming ever more into both a woman and a mermaid. <br />
<br />
Sam was breathing heavily as he felt his girlfriend wrap her arms around him and pull him close as resting her head on his shoulder and saying she loved him in a reassuring way. Still, he looked down transfixed through silky smooth curly black hair which now reached to his arm pits. All the hair minus the hair on his head where gone and he had clear smooth skin. Rising out from his chest nipples first where a pair of ever-growing breasts. A cups at first, then small Bs, and finally stopping in the C range even as his hips widened a bit as his waste narrowed, making his breasts stand out even more. His strong arms narrowed and became feminine even as his nails became perfectly manicured as thin membrane grew between the lower knuckles turning them into webbed hands. <br />
<br />
If he was looking at his new self from the waste up he would have been turned on in an instant and he was turned on, both by his girlfriend pressing herself against him and his new body. One of Taylor’s hands brushed against his new hardened nipples for a moment almost causing him to moan, where breasts always that sensitive, he had heard Taylor moan his name when he had played with hers but damn it was pleasurable. He knew the instant he…stopped being a he, the massive hard on he had began to shrink even while remaining at full attention, growing smaller and smaller until it went within him and became a slit, a wet slit which was begging to be played with but a slit none the less, he had become a she.<br />
<br />
While focused on her boyfriend, now girlfriend the changes kept going on on Taylor, her legs totally used into a single limb her yellow bikini bottom breaking apart replaced by a long and beautiful tail which was a mixture of purple, deep purple and some lighter purples. Her skin lost all faults as her neck grew a bit as her long blonde hair became a bright sunlight gold color as her blue eyes came even bluer. Her already narrow frame narrowed some more as gills appeared on her rib cage in line with her now expanded bust. Her bust forced her top to near it’s breaking point but she didn’t care. She was too busy comforting Sam as he became a she, she saw his hard on through hiss swim trunks disappear and knew he had just gotten a pussy. For some reason this didn’t upset her as much as she thought, she loved Sam and be he a man or now a women she still loved her and truth be told she was just as turned on seeing her new “girlfriend” as she had been with her boyfriend, was she bi and didn’t know it or was it the result of the transformation she didn’t care at the moment. <br />
She knew she was a full mermaid now, but Sam still had a little more to keep changes. <br />
<br />
Her legs quickly fused from the waste down, her legs becoming shapely and womanly a second before they were consumed by the new tail. The scales which grew over the flesh was pitch black, somehow even darker than her new silk smooth hair, unlike the others there was no shades, just a solid deep beautiful black mermaid tail to go with the dark hair, dark eyes and gorgeous body. <br />
<br />
It was done, two new mermaids sat on the beach.</p>
