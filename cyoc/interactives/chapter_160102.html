<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor woke up the next morning feeling surprisingly sensitive. He looked around and saw that it looked like Kendall was gone, headed off to school. He was not about to join her. Not with these changes ravaging his body. He  immediately leaped up out of bed and rushed, nude, into the bathroom and examined himself. Remembering as he did that it seemed these changes happened day to day. Connor found himself looking at an even further changed version of himself;<br />
<br />
His face was prettier, and if he&#39;d been in the mood, he would&#39;ve described that face as belonging to a fuckable girl. But seeing that kind of face on him, with a few of his strong features still mixed in there, his hair slightly longer...it really made him realize what was going on. Someone was fucking feminizing him. He looked and saw that his body was still toned, but his waist seemed to have a feminine taper inward, and his hips were wider. His ass was somewhat more pronounced.<br />
<br />
Connor felt his chest for a moment...and almost stumbled over from how good that felt.<br />
<br />
It was like a rush of pleasure down from his chest to his dick and then---Connor checked his dick at that. It was just slightly smaller than yesterday, about six inches long as opposed to his usual pornographic proportioned manhood. He felt tiny and misshapen, even though many other guys would still regard Connor as well proportioned in terms of his manhood. And it was damned erect as it was now.<br />
<br />
It took Connor a minute to cool his, heh, his tits. <br />
<br />
Looking at his chest, Connor saw that his chest was more developed now, almost moving from toned pecs to A-Cup breasts. And he knew from experience these things were damned sensitive. Almost made him want to just cut the investigation and just jerk off. He was after all still blessed with the same thundering libido as usual. Connor tried to get some further investigation of his body done, but he just couldn&#39;t keep his thoughts off of what he was packing.<br />
<br />
Just a pit stop, he thought.<br />
<br />
And so before long even as he sat at his computer trying to research, he pulled his short shorts down and jerked off, throwing his head back and groaning as he quickly hit orgasm and sprayed the floor with his jizz. Connor breathed and decided to get back to his research. He needed to work on this, and not just get distracted. Still, that was a remarkably good orgasm, and it left him just feeling incredible all over. Maybe...maybe there WERE some good sides to this whole mess.<br />
<br />
Two &quot;pit stops&quot; later and Connor was no closer to discovering what was wrong with him than he was at the start.<br />
<br />
He got up and decided to get some food, all this carnal indulgence and investigation was starving him. Getting some protein heavy cereal, almonds, a slice of fish, and some carrots, Connor went about his usual good nutrition. Still only clad in short shorts. He got up once he was done and dutifully cleaned up his dishes...wondering why he did that instead of calling in a hired maid to do it for him...<br />
<br />
Ah well, nothing to worry about. Just practicing clean living.<br />
<br />
Connor wondered about possibly leaving the house as he looked outside, seeing the noon sun. He was distinctly aware of his body and how it looked. He could very easily pass as either male or female depending on how he dressed. And that gave him some very odd ideas about what he could do today. He had never once even thought about doing something like that. He knew his mom still had some clothes here even though she was never around.<br />
<br />
The former jock thumbed his chin and pondered. He could explore this and see what would happen, or just go with the safe bet...</p>
