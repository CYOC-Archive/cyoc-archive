<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still shocked at the appearance of her future self Gloria gawked at the woman as she now taught class. Surprising she was an able enough sub. When class finished they hung back for a moment to talk. The adult Gloria smiled saying they would have plenty of time to talk back at home before shooing everyone off to their next class.<br />
<br />
As school ended Gloria and her friends got on the bus while Lynne drove with Tommy and Tricia. Everyone had agreed to meet at Gloria’s to talk with her adult self. The only question now was how Lisa would cope with yet another time traveler. “Mom,” Lynne and Gloria called as they raced into the house. “Where are you?”<br />
<br />
Lisa groaned as she now tried to sit up from the couch. Being pregnant was a pain in the ass, her usual energy seemed to be waning the more pregnant she became. After three months she found couch naps to be a regular part of her days off. “Girls,” she groaned. “What’s going on, I was napping.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry mom,” they apologized in unison. “But...there’s someone here to see you.”<br />
<br />
Lisa gazed curiously at the door as all of Gloria’s friends filed into the house. As the last one filed in she noticed an adult woman enter behind her. The woman was gorgeous, with long blond hair and a beautiful hourglass figure entered the house. “Who is that?”<br />
<br />
“Cmon mom,” the adult Gloria chuckled. “Don’t tell me you don’t recognize your own step daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Gloria,” Lisa exclaimed as she shot to her feet. “But..how? And what are you doing here? How is this possible?”<br />
<br />
“Long story,” the adult Gloria sighed. “Let’s just say that...due to things that have recently happened, it was a necessary for me to come here.” Lisa could only nod in shock as she gazed at her future daughter. “Is everything. Okay with you. Things have been a little nuts around here.”<br />
<br />
“I’m managing,” Adult Gloria sighed. “Unfortunately the epilepsy is new so I’ve had to adjust. That wasn’t Lynne’s fault by the way in case you were wondering. Still, it altered the future, actually the future has been altering a lot lately, which has us concerned.”<br />
<br />
“Things are that bad,” Lynne asked, a look of concern on her face. Adult Gloria shook her head as she looked at her little sister. “No things aren’t bad but they are different,” she said. “Actually younaccomplished What you set our to do. You did make things better, unfortunately you also put the future in flux. That’s why I have epilepsy now.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” Lynne said quietly hanging her head. Gloria smiled, placing her hand on her sisters shoulder. “Hey this isn’t your fault okay,” she said warmly. “It’s manageable right now. Thankfully I gained experience on how to handle my illness when time altered. I am here though to help though.”<br />
<br />
“How,” Gloria asked. “I mean, you have to go back to your time don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily,” she smirked. “You see mom doesn’t have magic so she could only stay for a limited amount of time. Me on the other hand, well I can stay as long as need be. To be honest, I’d like too. I’ve missed my sister.”<br />
<br />
“Missed bossing me around is more like it,” Lynne grumbled.<br />
<br />
Adult Gloria sighed as she looked at her little sister. “That’s not true Lynne,” she said sadly. “Look I know the whole thing with mom was an awful mistake and hurt you but Instill love you more than anything. I know I may have come across as bossy and overbearing but...it’s just how I am, you know how cautious I am.”<br />
<br />
“Okay true,” Lynne conceded. “And as crazy as you and past you have made me I missed seeing you too. Seeing...well...young you....it kinda freaks me out.”<br />
<br />
“Oh thanks,” Gloria grumbled crossing her arms. <br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Lynne replied sheepishly. “I mean your sort of cool...in a dorky kind of way. And I am sort of coming around to seeing that your friends are okay too.”<br />
<br />
“Lynne,” Adult Gloria laughed. “Your kind of digging a hole there, quit while your ahead okay? I think we both get it.” Lynne apologized again as she sheepishly looked at the two Gloria’s and her friends. She always hated feeling awkward in front of people. Thankfully the adult Gloria seemed to be taking things in stride as she looked at Lynne.<br />
<br />
“Okay hold up just a second here,” Lisa exclaimed as she looked at everyone. “What makes you think I want another future daughter staying here. In fact why in the world does everyone in the future seem to end up at my house? Do you have ANY idea how annoyed Jason is going to be to find out another future daughter wants to crash here!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry mom,” Adult Gloria replied meekly. “I just want to make things easier for you and dad. I remember how hard things were when you got pregnant and I just want to make things easier for you.”<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she gazed at the adult Gloria. It seemed that no matter her age the girl always wanted to make her family happy and make things easier for her and her father. It had been one of the things she had noticed almost immediately about the girl when she first saw her and it was one of the endearing qualities that Lisa could see the girl would carry to adulthood. “Ugh why you such a sweetheart Gloria,” she sighed.<br />
<br />
“She’s not a sweetheart mom she’s just a kiss ass,” Lynne teased. Lisa and both Gloria’s glared at the girl causing her to quickly apologize before giggling softly. “Well I’m sure your father will love having you around Gloria,” Lisa sighed. <br />
<br />
“Wait your staying,” Lynne exclaimed, gawking at her sister.<br />
<br />
“Well only if you want me too,” Gloria smiled. “I mean I am hear to help you out. Plus...hoping I can improve theour relationship as well as your relationship with younger me here.”<br />
<br />
Lynne rubbed her chin as she looked at the woman. “I don’t know,” she mumbled. “I mean where would you stay? What would you do?”<br />
<br />
“I have a couple of ideas,” Adult Gloria smirked. “It all depends on what you say though. As far as where I would stay, if it’s a problem staying here I can always stay at Katie’s house.”<br />
<br />
Lynne sighed as she looked at her sister, did she really want her staying here? Things were slowly beginning to improve with the teen Gloria, would having the older version of her sister ruin that? Looking at Gloria Lynne decided.</p>
