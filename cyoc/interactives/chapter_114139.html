<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The first thing we are doing,” Frieda looking at her father; “is going shopping. You need a new wardrobe.”<br />
“Like hell I do,” Benton looking at his daughter; “the suits I have are perfect for everyday stuff.”<br />
“That’s because,” Frieda seeing her father adjust the cuffs on his suit jacket; “it’s all you have. Time to get something more relaxing and clearly more casual.”<br />
“You are not getting me in sweats and track suits,” Benton looking suspicious; “nor will I contemplate shorts.”<br />
“Would you rather have a mani-pedi,” Frieda giving her father a devilish look.<br />
“God help me,” Benton rolling his eyes; “get in the car.”<br />
<br />
Spencer and Eric chuckled as they watched the exchange between Frieda and Benton; both knowing what Frieda had planned. They shared a shower as all three gotten cleaned up. Enjoying scrubbing each other’s bodies; using it as an excuse to explore each other while out of their fursona. Eric had a devil of a time resisting the urge to bend either girl over and take her then and there. Having to make due as they teased him and then orally pleased him while all lathered up; it was a wonder the three even left the shower all together.<br />
<br />
Now both Eric and Spencer were in Spencer’s pickup truck; a gift from her grandfather for getting her driver’s license. Watching Benton drive out of the garage in his Lamborghini Veneno; Spencer starts up her truck and drives on off to home.<br />
“Frieda is going to drive her father mental,” Eric chuckling; “you think he is going to want another day with her after what she has planned?”<br />
“Clothes shopping is Frieda’s favorite past time,” Spencer smiling; “besides us. I’m sure her father will suffer through it for a chance to bond with her better.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Benton pulled into the nearby gas station closest to his estate. Seeing the area surrounded by police cruisers and an ambulance; Benton was naturally curious as to what happened. Expecting and FBI agent along with a deputy at his estate while enjoying breakfast with his daughter and her friends, the were-panther naturally put it out of his head as he was having a genuine good time cooking pancakes and watching his daughter eat them with glee.<br />
“Just give me a moment while I gas up the car,” Benton looking at his daughter; “you want anything from the station?”<br />
“Not hungry,” Frieda on her phone; “but I’ll take a pop.”<br />
“Sugary drinks this early,” Benton looking at his daughter; “I think we’ll take a pass on that.”<br />
<br />
Frieda looks up as her father gets out to gas up his car and approach on of the deputies. While she was a were-panther and had excellent hearing; Frieda was unable to hear the exchange between her father and the deputy. Yet she see her father return with a happy grin on his face.<br />
“Obviously you heard something you liked,” Frieda going back to her phone.<br />
It wasn’t long afterwards that her father came back after paying for the gas to his car.<br />
“So what was all that about,” Frieda speaking up.<br />
“One of Freddie Parker’s men was killed,” Benton answering; “it was the man that the police lost track of as he was coming up to our estate. We won’t be worrying about him,” Benton looking at his daughter;  “so which store are you getting me to go to first?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Spencer pulls up into her parents driveway just as her father pulls up. Excited and thrilled, she jumps out of her truck just as her parents come out of the car. Maggie, Spencer’s mother is cradling her newborn son Evan junior.<br />
“Just in time to welcome your brother home,” Maggie beaming at her daughter; “help your father bring in the bags will you?”<br />
<br />
Spencer wanted to look and ogle at her baby brother, but a cough from her father directed her attention back to him. Reluctantly she approached her dad who then quickly gave her a big hug.<br />
“After what happened last night,” Evan looking at Spencer; “I’m a little reluctant to let you go out again tonight.”<br />
“I can take care of myself,” Spencer unable to free herself from her father’s grasp; “you saw to that.”<br />
“I know,” Evan letting go; “now help me with the overnight bags.”<br />
“Eric is here,” Spencer grabbing a bag; “I told him you might have some advice on dealing with killing a person. After last night…”<br />
“Understandable,” Evan looking at Eric as he was just getting out of the truck; “but he will have to wait, your baby brother takes priority at the moment.”<br />
<br />
Both Spencer and Eric follow Evan Sr into the house. With Spencer placing down the bag and then following her father upstairs, she gets her first look at the finally completed nursery. Painted the Tardis blue she picked out and seeing the crib in the center of the room; the only other pieces of furniture is the change table and a nursery chair for Maggie when she breast feeds the baby. Currently the chair is occupied by a sleeping black furred werewolf with streaks of grey.<br />
“Dad,” Evan looking at his father passed out in the chair; “wake up! Come and great your grandson.”<br />
<br />
Mike Lawson wakes up to see Maggie placing her infant son in his new crib and observes as his son and granddaughter look at the sleeping child.<br />
“Let me take a look at the tyke,” Mike quickly standing up; his tail happily swaying back and forth as he sees the sleeping infant for the first time since he was born. A sudden swelling of pride overtakes the elder werewolf and he feels the urge to howl; yet Evan seeing his father raising his lupine muzzle into the air, Evan stops his father cold.<br />
“Don’t even think about waking my son up,” Evan looking at Mike; “save your howl for another time.”<br />
“Spoilsport,” Mike grumbles as he leans forward and gently strokes the baby’s head with his large paw; “so who wants steaks for lunch?”<br />
“Eric and I will take ours rare,” Spencer licking her lips all the while dragging Eric towards the crib to get a glimpse at Evan Jr.</p>
