<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nikki shivered as she and Jessica stepped out of the lingerie shop into the cooler air of the mall. Her new bra felt fine, good even, but her shirt was way too tight. Plus, even with the padding, her perked nipples straining against the cloth were really obvious.<br />
<br />
She tried folding her arms to cover them, but the added pressure on her breasts made the tingling she was feeling increase. She considered ducking back into the restroom, since massaging them earlier had helped her discomfort. She tried subtly stroking herself with her fingers instead and caught Jessica grinning at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Nikki asked. &quot;You seem awfully pleased about my distress. I had to drop $60 on a bra I&#39;ll hopefully only need for a few days! Do you think they&#39;ll let me return it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, as long as you don&#39;t stain it, probably.&quot; Jessica said. &quot;Hey, how about we stop in that trendy place? There&#39;s usually some cute boys hanging out there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me we didn&#39;t come to the mall so you could flirt with boys.&quot; Nikki frowned. <br />
<br />
Normally she&#39;d have been up for some window shopping, boy-wise, but her swollen chest had her feeling self conscious, and she&#39;d seen how guys clustered around girls with big breasts. Like it or not, for however long it would take her chest to return to normal, she definitely qualified as big-breasted.<br />
<br />
The thought sent a shiver down Nikki&#39;s spine. She&#39;d nearly gotten off playing with her breasts earlier, and had started fondling herself again in the restroom as soon as she&#39;d gotten her old bra off. She&#39;d never cared much for breast-play before, though her boyfriends certainly had.  Whatever made her breasts grow had sent their sensitivity through the roof as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no!&quot; Jessica answered quickly.  &quot;I&#39;m just happy to get out to the mall and spend time with you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki reluctantly dropped her arms to her sides, telling herself that stroking could easily lead to squeezing then maybe some pinching and-- she shook her head, what was wrong with her? It was as if she hadn&#39;t been laid in months and couldn&#39;t keep sex, or at least stimulating herself, off her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Jessica, we&#39;re roommates? When don&#39;t we spend time together?&quot; Nikki snapped.<br />
<br />
She felt bad about being bitchy to Jessica, who she realized had been trying to help her all morning. She must have noticed Nikki&#39;s swelling chest, and for once being practical, had dragged her to the mall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just want you to know you&#39;re more than a roommate to me, you&#39;re my friend!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica surprised Nikki with a hug, which she returned, trying desperately not to think about their boobs squished tight together, all warm and soft--except that Nikki thought her tight nipples must be digging into Jessica something fierce. <br />
<br />
Nikki felt a sudden wave of heat sweeping through her body, pooling in her loins. She fought the impulse to grab two big handfuls of Jessica&#39;s booty and pull their bodies tight together. She let go and stumbled back a step panting to catch her breath. She wasn&#39;t due for her period, but damned if she wasn&#39;t a hormonal mess all of a sudden!<br />
<br />
Nikki glanced at Jessica and thought she looked almost, smug? Her grin certainly looked predatory, and the way she was eyeing Nikki&#39;s chest had her swallowing a sudden mouthful of saliva. Had Jessica been bi, been into her all this time and she hadn&#39;t noticed? <br />
<br />
And what did it mean that she was responding to that possibility? If her hormones were out of whack that might explain the breast growth, but didn&#39;t changes like that take a long time? Weeks or even months?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang girl! Lookin&#39; fine!&quot;<br />
<br />
The catcall provided the distraction Nikki desperately needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it in your pants, dirtbag!&quot; She called out, as she turned to stare down the pack boys ogling her. She planted her fists on her hips and willed her body language to project defiance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming you can find it without tweezers and microscope!&quot; Jessica chimed in as she stepped over to stand shoulder to shoulder with Nikki. <br />
<br />
The boys seemed embarrassed to be harassed back, but none of them had a ready response.<br />
<br />
Nikki gave Jessica a sideways high five, only realizing her mistake as she felt her boobs slam from side to side. The hem of her shirt had ridden up, and tight as it was, it did nothing to hide the wave motion as her breasts rocked back and forth.<br />
<br />
The boy and his friends watched her chest move with open mouths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about milk shake,&quot; Jessica said, &quot;if we don&#39;t get you into something more discrete you&#39;re going to bust nuts without even trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys, hands covering their growing boners, hurried away, occasionally glancing back and whispering to each other.<br />
<br />
Nikki felt her stomach churn, and her body felt covered with cold sweat.  She wrapped her arms around herself, fighting her sudden nausea. The pressure on her gut seemed to help some. She had a nice flat tummy from her jogging, not that she could see it past her swollen breasts, or that she&#39;d be doing much exercising in public until she was back to normal if the boys&#39; reaction was any indication. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you okay?&quot; Jessica asked as she put her arms around Nikki and pulled her close.<br />
<br />
Nikki rested her forehead on Jessica&#39;s shoulder. Why did the thought of guys getting off make her feel sick? She trembled, desperately trying to think of anything but the sticky white spunk which was making her gag. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Nikki, are you going to be sick?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica guided her to a trashcan and bent her over it. The stale fast food wrappers and a leaky diaper had sour vomit coursing up her throat. Jessica was dimly grateful she hadn&#39;t had any breakfast after all.<br />
<br />
When she was through she spat a couple times and wiped her mouth. Her chest was pressed against the lip of the can, and for once today the sensation wasn&#39;t turning her on. She heard Jessica talking to someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;--she was fine this morning, but I guess maybe those guys made her nervous? It&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t think we need an ambulance--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All through? Here&#39;s some water, swish and spit just like at the dentist okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The mall cop handing her the cup of water had on latex gloves, and there was a first responder bag on the floor by his feet. Nikki followed his directions and winced as he shined a pen light in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you take anything? Have you been drinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki shook her head negative. If Jessica had slipped her something--when, last night?--she didn&#39;t want to get her in trouble. She felt numb and cold, though that could easily be that her shirt had ridden up while she puked and looked like a crop top, barely covering her bra. Nikki didn&#39;t want to bring more attention to her breasts by tugging it down, and resigned herself to looking like a tramp for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, where are you parked? We&#39;ll walk you out, but I really think your friend ought to get checked out by a doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki trailed behind Jessica as the cops escorted them through the crowds. People stopped to stare, and she caught a couple comments about the way she was dressed.  Jessica dropped back and put an arm around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignore those bitches, whatever&#39;s wrong with you, we&#39;ll figure it out when we get home.&quot; Jessica whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know what&#39;s wrong, we just don&#39;t know why. Did you give me something last night?&quot; Nikki hissed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jessica said emphatically, drawing looks from the mall cops. <br />
<br />
Under other circumstances Nikki wouldn&#39;t have minded chatting up the cute one, but now thinking about that had her guts knotting up again. She clutched her belly and focused on taking deep breaths, which got her noticing her too-sensitive breasts, and her still perked despite everything that had happened nipples. <br />
<br />
Had they been like that when the cute cop had been examining her? She hadn&#39;t noticed him getting a stiffy, Nikki concluded he must be gay. Oddly that thought helped her relax. She was able to straighten up and noticed they&#39;d drawn another small crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay folks, keep walkin&#39; nothing to see here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki started giggling, she couldn&#39;t help herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you didn&#39;t take anything? Anyone give you something to drink or eat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jessica!&quot; Nikki clutched her roommate&#39;s shoulder. &quot;We were supposed to go grocery shopping! We&#39;re all out of milk!&quot; That set Jessica off laughing too.<br />
<br />
&quot;You loon, we&#39;ll get some later, right now I need to get you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki accepted a business card from the gay cop as he helped her into Jessica&#39;s car. &#39;Thad Jorgensen&#39; even his name sounded gay. She waved as they pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that was a disaster.&quot; Jessica said as they pulled up to a stop light.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I may have spent way too much money on a bra, sent boys running from the sight of my boobs, and tossed my cookies in a mall trashcan, but at least I got the name and number of the nicest gay rent-a-cop you could ever hope to meet.&quot; Nikki replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay? Really?&quot; Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, &#39;cuz if he&#39;s not I&#39;m gonna puke all over your dashboard.&quot; Nikki warned her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I think you&#39;ve got bigger things to worry about.&quot; Jessica turned off the street and stopped sharply in her parking spot outside their assortment building.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re jealous I got his number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I mean,&quot; she gestured at Nikki&#39;s chest. &quot;I guess you won&#39;t be returning that bra after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki looked down to see two damp spots staining her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man! Was there something spilled on that trashcan, and I rubbed my tits in it?!&quot; Nikki wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No honey, that&#39;s all you.&quot; Jessica said, reaching over to cup one of Nikki&#39;s breasts and roll her stiffened nipple between her index finger and thumb.<br />
<br />
Nikki was speechless. It was the most intimate thing Jessica had ever done to her, and she felt moisture trickling both from her nipple, and from her pussy.<br />
<br />
She grabbed Jessica and pulled her into the most intense kiss she could give her, with plenty of tongue action.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t have waited to do that until we were alone?&quot; Nikki asked, running the top of her tongue across Jessica&#39;s lips. &quot;You&#39;re lucky I want you out of those clothes,&quot; she slid her hand down to grind her fingers between Jessica&#39;s legs. &quot;or I&#39;d jill the living daylights out of you right here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki sat back to admire the astonished look on Jessica&#39;s face. Her nipples had perked as well, though not as obviously as Nikki&#39;s, and her pants had a damp spot we&#39;re Nikki had been fingering her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, you just, we--&quot; Jessica broke off, blushing furiously.<br />
<br />
Nikki stretched her arms over her head, smiling widely as Jessica&#39;s eyes bugged slightly as she stared at Nikki&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re more than just a roommate to me too you know.&quot; Nikki said huskily.</p>
