<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mmm... Ughhh...&quot; Brett Simpson stirred from unconsciousness. He had no idea what was happening. The last thing he remembered, he was walking back to his dorm with his roommate Greg Johnson. It was late at night and though the neighborhood they were walking in wasn&#39;t the safest, they thought two semi muscular teens would deter any unsavory people away. Clearly, that was not to be the case. Out of no where, something hit him in the head and he feel unconsciousness. He had no idea what happened to Greg. Did he escape? Do he get whacked too? That was what was racing through his mind as his thoughts returned to him. It felt oddly chilly, even though it was the middle of summer. &quot;Ugh... My head...&quot; Suddenly, he heard another voice similar in age to him. That must have been Greg. &quot;So he&#39;s here with me?&quot; Brett thought as his vision started to return to him. He was immediately hit with a light from above. It took several dozen more seconds for it to come back to him completely. &quot;What... in the world?!&quot; His first thoughts went to movies. It was like a sci-fi movie. The whole room was covered in silver and white. As he looked around, his sights were set straight forward. &quot;Shit!&quot; was all he could say. His dick was staring right back at him as the chilly sensation he felt was paired with what he was seeing. He was completely naked and was laying down on a cold hard operating table. He was chained to it as well. While he could move his arms and legs, he was unable to push them up or off the table. &quot;Ughh...&quot; Greg continued to stir. &quot;Greg! Hey Greg! Wake up!&quot; &quot;Ugh... Huh... Brett.&quot; Greg&#39;s eyes started to open up. Still a bit stupefied, he looked around the room as a realization soon took place. &quot;Whoa!&quot; Greg tried to move himself, but he was in the same situation as Brett, tied down and naked. They had seen each other naked before, but even in this situation, Brett couldn&#39;t help but think how Greg had a bigger dick. &quot;Brett?! Dude, what the fuck is going on, man?!&quot; &quot;Like I&#39;d know! This isn&#39;t some prank right?!&quot; &quot;Are you brain damaged?! Who the fuck would make a prank like this?!&quot; &quot;I see you two are nice and awake now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Brett and Greg heard a third voice. They stared straight ahead and noticed another man was in the room. They couldn&#39;t tell what his exact age was, but he was at least in his thirties. He wore normal work clothes which were covered by a white jacket. The two teens could only think of a scientist. &quot;Who the fuck are you?!&quot; Greg was the first one to talk. &quot;My oh my, what a mouth you have young man!&quot; the man replied as he walked towards a smaller table. Brett could see there were syringes and the like on the table. Just the sight of them disturbed him. &quot;Hey man! We don&#39;t want to cause any problems here?!&quot; He immediately went into defensive mode. Who knew what was in those things. &quot;Don&#39;t be a pansy man! This pedo ain&quot;t shit!&quot; Greg continued to make it worse. &quot;Dammit Greg!&quot; Though the two of them were roommates and jocks, Greg took it to the next level. He was the King of the World in his mind. &quot;You&#39;d be wise to listen to your friend... Greg!&quot; the man said as he took hold of Greg&#39;s face, squishing his cheeks inward. &quot;Fuck you! Pttt!&quot; Greg spat out as he spit in his captor&#39;s face. &quot;Oh for fuck&#39;s sake!&quot; Brett thought as Greg made the bad situation worse. &quot;Heh! You are quite the &#39;catch&#39; aren&#39;t you Greg?&quot; the man said as he gripped onto Greg&#39;s dick. &quot;Whoa! Holy Crap! Aghhhh!&quot; &quot;You seem to forget who is in control here. He held onto it quite tight as Greg thrashed on the table. &quot;Let me go! Agh! God! Let me go, please!&quot; &quot;Well since you asked nicely,&quot; the man said as he let go. &quot;Ahh... Oh god! My dick!&quot; Greg started to tear up as he pissed himself. Evidently, the stimulus on his dick messed up with his bowels. &quot;No way...&quot; was all Greg could say as he let nature take his course. The man went to a control panel that moved the table up and drained the urine down to a hole in the floor. A shower head appeared and washed the rest of the urine off of Greg&#39;s body. The man then went back to the smaller table, reminding Brett of the syringes once more. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to us?&quot; Brett asked tentatively. &quot;Why I&#39;m glad you asked!&quot; the man said, a gleam in his eyes. &quot;Have the two of you ever wondered about how your bodies grow up? Have you ever wondered if there was some way to alter the flow of time in regards to out body? Well I am one of those people. To be able to control the age of men and women alike has been a goal of mine for as long as I can remember. And with the liquid in these syringes, I am one step closer to realizing my dream!&quot; This man was clearly crazy, though Brett dared not speak it to his captor. &quot;You... You&#39;re crazy, man!&quot; Greg had no such filter for his thoughts. &quot;And yet, the vials do not lie. Now I need to figure out how to fully control this power and to do that I need live specimens,&quot; he said as he walked back towards Greg. &quot;No... No, no, no, no, no! Get the fuck away from me!&quot; The man said nothing as he continued to walk towards Greg. &quot;No! Please! Brett! Brett, stop him!&quot; But Brett could do nothing as the man came up to Greg, syringe drawn. &quot;No! Noooooooo!&quot; Greg pleas remained unanswered as the man took the syringe and injected it into Greg&#39;s arm. &quot;Ahh... Ahh...&quot; Greg just let out a few moans as the liquid was injected into his body.<br />
<br />
An eerie silence enveloped the room as all three awaited what was to come, albeit for different reasons. &quot;Ahh!&quot; Suddenly, Greg&#39;s body jumped up. After a few more seconds, it jumped again and again. Soon Greg&#39;s entire body was squirming. &quot;Ahhh! Ahhhhh! Gaaaahhh!&quot; It was clear to Brett that Greg was in a great deal of pain. His dick shot up and got erect almost immediately. &quot;It hurts! Oh god, it hurts!&quot; As Greg continued to writhe in pain, Brett could see his muscles pulse and then extract. The muscles that Greg fought hard for were melting from his body. His body started to cave inward while his body hair started to recede back into his pores. Greg was getting younger. He looked like he was 16 years old. &quot;Gah! Gah!&quot; Greg let out weird grunts as he ejaculated. That it could happen without Greg touching it showed just how much his body was warping. As he stopped cumming, his dick returned to its flaccid state, albeit much smaller than Brett&#39;s own. Greg looked like he was thirteen. His body hair was gone besides those on his testicles and even that bush was vanishing. His body was nothing but skin and bones. The restraints clamped down harder as a result. They seemed to be designed to contain a body changing sides. Greg now looked 10. His body hair was now gone completely and his penis was no no bigger than four inches. &quot;Gah! Guh! My body!&quot; Brett could hear Gage trying to talk through the pain. His voice sounded much younger as his Adam&#39;s Apple shrunk back into his neck. His hands and feet continued to shrink as his finger and toes clamped together in pain. Gage now looked to be about six. &quot;No! Stop! Stahp!&quot; Gage&#39;s voice was even younger and his speech was trying starting to slur. He was now about half his height and weight. His dick flapped around, now a good two inches. Greg looked towards Brett and he could see the tears streamed down his face. &quot;Help me, Brett! I don wanna be a baby. Ah! No! Pwease! No mwore!&quot; Greg&#39;s speech slurred even more. He couldn&#39;t look less then three years old. &quot;No! No! Gah, gah! Gah?! Gah, gah, goo!&quot; Now Greg could no longer talk. As the rest of the hair on his head receded back into his scalp and his chubby baby hands and feet stuck up and out, Greg&#39;s body finally slowed down its regression until he was no more then a baby of one year age. &quot;Goo, goo, gah, gah!&quot; was all he could say. He didn&#39;t look sad anymore at least. &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; was all Brett could say as his roommate became a toddler. <br />
<br />
&quot;Success!&quot; the man said. He went to the panel and loosened the restraints. He picked up Greg and admired his work. &quot;To think this baby was once a man!&quot; The man took Greg and went towards several containers on the floor. He tickled Greg&#39;s balls. &quot;Ah, hee, hee, hee!&quot; Greg let out a happy laugh as he peed into one of the containers. As soon as he finished, the man grabbed Greg by the arms and stimulated his bowels so he could poop into another container. &quot;What are you doing to him?!&quot; Brett asked, horrified that this man would assault his babified friend. &quot;I must have DNA, of course and the piss and shit of a baby is the best thing for that!&quot; He took a swab and rubbed it on Greg&#39;s mouth for a saliva sample. He put it in another container and covered each one. He took Greg again and placed him in a bigger container. &quot;This is no crib, but it should do for now.&quot; He then left Greg on his own. Brett could see Greg play with his tiny feet. His mind was that of a toddler as well, alright. &quot;And now for Subject # 2!&quot; Brett knew what that meant immediately. &quot;No! Wait! You don&#39;t really need me now that you have Greg right?&quot; &quot;Oh?&quot; the man said intrigued. &quot;I&#39;m right! Greg should give you anything he wants. You can even use that stuff on him still, right?&quot; Brett knew he was cosigning his roommate to hell, but he wasn&#39;t a good enough person to worry about the ethics of things. &quot;And how do you intend to explain his disappearance, eh?&quot; &quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy! I&#39;ll just say I woke up from being knocked out and Greg was gone. A lot of people hated him, as you could tell, and I&#39;ll make sure to never to say a word. I promise! You can use me for all the experiments you want if I betray you. Implant a tracker or whatever Sci-Fi shit you want on me, so... yeah?&quot; Even Brett was surprised at what he was saying. He never realized he could be this smart. &quot;You make a very good point, my boy.&quot; Brett smiled, thinking he had convinced him. &quot;I do, yeah. So, please... Let me go!&quot; A few seconds passed as the man just stood there. Thinking, he had got through, Brett let his guard down, only to be met with a prick of his skin. &quot;What... Why?&quot; Brett looked to his arm and saw that he had been injected with the syringe. &quot;Well, there were two reasons. One, I just don&#39;t like people who betray other people. Though I could let that pass, if it wasn&#39;t for reason number two... And that was when you said you were right. No one is superior to me, young... or old.&quot; &quot;Ah... Ahh...&quot; Brett could say nothing as the rest of the liquid was injected into his body.<br />
<br />
Brett no had a front row seat to what had just happened to Greg. Although nothing was happening yet, Brett could feel the serum disperse throughout his body from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. A few more seconds passed. &quot;Ahh!&quot; Brett let out a loud yelp as his body jumped up. He could start to feel his body heat up. &quot;Ahh! Ahhh! Gah!&quot; Brett&#39;s body jumped up several more times as he started to squirm. By now his whole body was on fire. He could feel the serum sink deep into his very DNA and start to change him from within. He could feel each and every one of his bones crack and reshape itself. &quot;Oh god! It burns!&quot; Brett cried out in pain as he started to grow. Like Greg, his dick became immediately erect. It shook uncomfortably on his body as he ejaculated all over himself. &quot;Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!&quot; Brett let out intermittent yelps as his body continued to change. He was in his twenties by now. His muscular body started to misshapen. His biceps sunk back in and his abs fell inwards one by one as his belly bloated. His body hair grew more and more until it was covering most of his body quite decently. By now he was in his thirties. &quot;Guh!&quot; Unlike with Greg, Brett&#39;s dick was still erect and was shooting out thick strings of cum once again. It pooled under his body which was getting fatter and fatter. His hands and feet were all chubby and smelly with an older man&#39;s stank. By now he was in his forties. As he continued to cum, his body started to get skinnier again. His body hair continued to cover more of his skin. His heart started to feel the burn of old age as his erect dick started to shrink and shrivel. The flab from his initial fat slid down his body becoming baggy skin. By now he was in his fifties. As he cummed once more, he could feel his gums start to weaken and his teeth become loose. &quot;Ahhh.... Ahhhh!&quot; Bret continued to moan. He could hear his voice was getting older and older. Finally, his dick started to get flaccid as it continued to shrivel away. His fat body was no more and his body hair was receding too as it started to grey. By now he was in his sixties. By now, he was skinnier then he had ever been before and his body had completely lost its youthful figure. He continued to squirm, but was loosing his breath more and more as he did so. His teeth were incredibly loose in his gums and soon they were falling out of his mouth. &quot;Ahh... Mah teeth!&quot; His speech started to slur as he progressed into his seventies. His head hair was starting to fall off as clumps. In seconds only several dozen strands of hair was left on his head in an up and down pattern. His skin was now all baggy and old. He could feel himself lose control of his facilities as he started to piss himself. The man moved to table upwards and the urine slid down into a container on the floor. Brett shed tears as he became an 80 year old man, his transformation complete.</p>
