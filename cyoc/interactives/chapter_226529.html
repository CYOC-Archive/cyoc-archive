<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oliver wasn’t aware of how he looked but he had felt himself transforming and now there was only one thing he wanted to do. He looked around his bedroom, noticing it felt much more cramped, before spotting his open bedroom door. Oliver rushed back to the bathroom, his body created large thuds from his heavier weight as he moved quickly. It would probably annoy his neighbors downstairs and he’d probably have to hear them complain to him about it tomorrow but he didn’t care. He entered the bathroom and shut the door.<br />
<br />
Oliver glanced at the bathroom mirror and stared at his new appearance. The black jock from before starring back. The mirror was barely able to capture him due to his new height, his head at the very top of the mirror. <br />
<br />
He looked much older but not too old, he would guess around the age of 30. That meant he was a whole 7 years older than he usually was. Oliver flexed his new muscles as he felt a newfound sense of power coursing through him. The athletic shorts have given him energy and the jockstrap have given him strength. He wondered what other attributes he could possess after trying on the other clothing he bought.<br />
<br />
Oliver was incredibly handsome now, he flashed a smile worthy of a movie star as he admired his good looks. Where had a hunk like this been hiding all this time? Oliver couldn’t even recall spotting the man he now was a single time in public. Lucky for him, he just so happened to acquire his old jockstrap. He’d probably donated it due to its tightness around the waist. A stud like this was bound to continually work out and build his muscles, leaving him with the need for new clothing that could properly fit.<br />
<br />
At a neutral expression Oliver appeared threatening with a piercing glare but upon smiling he looked charming and sexy. This body was going to be hard to top. Oliver delighted in exploring his new muscles as he flexed his big biceps and bounced his large pecs. He became so lost in fascination that Oliver was surprised by a sudden knock at the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Oliver! Get out! I need to shower.”<br />
<br />
It was Edgar! And he sounded annoyed. Things probably hadn’t gone well in class and Oliver assumed he was going to blame him for accidentally withholding his textbook. <br />
<br />
Oliver began to panic as he tried to decide his next move. He was completely unprepared for Edgar’s return and hadn’t even heard him enter the apartment. Fortunately he had closed the door but Edgar wasn’t a patient individual. He was bound to burst the door open eventually especially with the lack of a lock in the door.<br />
<br />
The bathroom lock had broken last week and they hadn’t replaced it, not bothered by it in the slightest. Although Oliver felt incredibly bothered by it in the present. It seemed likely that Edgar would open the door at any moment, especially since he was feeling irritated, and see him.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t just waltz out, Edgar would flip! Not only was he just wearing a jockstrap but the random appearance of an intimidating stranger in their bathroom was sure to cause chaos. Edgar would instantly dial the police and Oliver would probably be arrested. <br />
<br />
He HAD to find a way back to his room without Edgar noticing.<br />
<br />
“Oliver! Hurry Up!” Edgar shouted, his voice was rising and it was apparent that he wasn’t going to wait much longer.<br />
<br />
To Oliver’s relief he heard Edgar’s phone going off. Listening closely, he heard the sound of footsteps moving away and after hearing the sound of a door open he booked it!<br />
<br />
Oliver raced back to his bedroom, his body continuing to make loud thuds as he ran into his room and locked the door. He laid against his door and let out a sigh of relief, he hadn’t been caught. Oliver noticed that Edgar’s bedroom door had been closed, probably because Edgar wanted privacy for his call. Oliver felt lucky. It was a good thing someone had called Edgar or he wasn’t sure what would’ve happened.<br />
<br />
Oliver began to imagine what he would do if he had been caught by Edgar, losing himself in a daydream. He imagined Edgar’s shocked reaction at Oliver’s new body and his incredible physique. His new body bulging with muscles and power as he stood in front of Edgar, a stark contrast to the roommate he expected to see.<br />
<br />
Before long Oliver felt a peculiar sensation as he felt the jockstrap become even tighter. He had already been feeling a little horny, the transformations always giving him new sensations and stimulations than aroused him,<br />
but he had a full-on erection now!<br />
<br />
His dick struggled to breath as it grew to its full length of 12 inches, his member becoming more cramped as it try to fit alongside his larger balls. The jockstrap was beginning to feel extremely uncomfortable as his cock began to stain the fabric further with pre. Unable to withstand it, Oliver pulled down the jockstrap to his knees and began to stroke his cock, reflectively playing with his nipples.<br />
<br />
His new body was making him feel incredible and the arousal that had been building up had only gotten stronger. Oliver masturbated as he embraced his body, feeling the way his new muscles moved to his movements. He looked down at his large pecs as they jiggled slightly from his actions, his entire body tensing as it struggled to contain his excitement.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! I’m so horny!” Oliver said in his deeper voice. It was nearly an octave lower than his old one, a rich baritone.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t too long before Oliver knees buckled and he felt himself cumming. Waves of semen erupting and falling on to the ground. However, Oliver continued to play with his nipples, still seeking more pleasure as he began to stroke his large girthy cock once more.<br />
<br />
After jerking off a few more times, Oliver felt satisfied as he stopped. There was a large amount of cum on the floor now, spattered everywhere messily. A different result from his dry orgasm from before. Yanking some tissues from his desk Oliver quickly cleaned up his mess and threw them in his waste bin.<br />
<br />
Pulling the jockstrap back up, Oliver felt happy at his new body. Ready to play with it some more. However, his mind was more clear after his jerk off session and Oliver knew it would be more logical to turn back to his original self. Edgar was going to want to talk to him eventually and he couldn’t risk being seen like this.<br />
<br />
Oliver took the jockstrap off and threw it on his bed with a disappointed sigh. He grabbed his boxers and put them back on.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
“Edgar do you want to talk?” Oliver asked and knocked on the bathroom door. <br />
<br />
Edgar was taking a shower and had just turned the water off. Oliver was back to his normal self, wearing some sweatpants over his boxers and a green shirt. He adjusted his glasses somewhat annoyed, missing the perfect vision he had had in his other two bodies. The ring wasn’t on his finger anymore. It was hidden in the bottom of his first drawer, underneath a pile of socks.<br />
<br />
“No! Go away!” he responded angrily. <br />
<br />
Yep. He was mad alright.<br />
<br />
Oliver grumbled to himself and went back to his bedroom. His perspective of the room was back to its usual viewpoint. A bit small but big enough for a single person. His bed stood to the side, the bags of clothing hidden underneath, with his dresser next to it. He had a closet, a laundry hamper, a trash can, and a desk in his room but no windows. Something he was now grateful for after using the ring.<br />
<br />
He opened his top drawer and took out the ring before rubbing it between his index finger and thumb, contemplating what to do. It had been fun using it and he even felt tempted to use it again but he wasn’t sure if could risk it with Edgar now back.</p>
