<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlon looked back at the room, seeing that Rodrigo was indeed most likely in the East Wall. The massive pit-wolf paused at the exit as he felt old and new memories, of Charon and Charlie, of the pitbull that was his original character and the wolf that Glitz had gladly Trimmed him into, to live a new life free of Paranor&#39;s dark past. When the disc was attached to his forehead and blasted Master Ajax&#39;s brainwashing straight into Charlie&#39;s mind, Charon was awakened from deep inside the wolf after being Trimmed and having lived as Charlie for so long. The disc detected the loyalty with Master Ajax and ended the process early causing Charon and Charlie to fuse. With the merge of past and present, memories of both lives melded together so seamlessly that the world was readjusting to fit Charlon.<br />
<br />
Charlon frowned as he thought of his life so far. From serving Paranor as a brute of a barbarian to living the life of a rogue thanks to Glitz. The stag had given Charon a new life to live, trying to forget his old past however the machine caught the wolf and trimmed him into a pitbull had resurfaced everything that was thought to be buried. He turned and ran back to the party, now remembering everything and most likely capable of notifying them of what Ajax had planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I expected to forget that man, and now I&#39;m back and more!&quot; Charlon growled as he ran past the golems that, upon seeing him turned their heads around to continue their pre-programmed directives. His steps thudded with weight and stressed carefulness as he subconsciously muffled his steps, his leather armor with many tickets barely making much sound. Charlon took turns as reality shifted to fit Charlon. His party members and friends, Geoffrey, Gregory, Veles, and even Oswin, and the group would be somewhere near the first secret room.<br />
<br />
Another turn around the dimly lit corridors with the musk of dried cum all over the place, statues of Master Ajax here and there was much of what he saw as he rushed back. The party needed a rest and the faster he arrived, the better. Charlon was looking forward to shoving his cock into his friends, because with his thick body and cock, being the party top was natural. He licked his lips, still remembering Master Ajax&#39;s tongue on his cock...<br />
<br />
Soon enough he could see them, and Charlon didn&#39;t stop even when Oswin aimed a bow at his heart before all of them relaxed when they saw that it was him. The whole reality was trimmed and updated to fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rodrigo is not in the coffins, most likely in the East Wall. Seems like he had trimming or something done with him.&quot; Charlon panted as he looked at the others. Indeed, he was bringing them along to stop Master Ajax... Mostly. <br />
<br />
To Charlon, maybe if Master Ajax was defeated, they could gain a strong ally. Charlon was confident that he could convince his former master and lover to switch sides, release the inhabitants of Diamond Hollow, and stop trying to conquer the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rodrigo hasn&#39;t been trimmed at all.&quot; Oswin remarked trying to make sense. There was no way the fat wolf was trimmed to become the mayor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he used transmutation potions or something,&quot; Veles countered, the muscular cougar looking at Charlon and going red in the face. The pitwolf grinned as he recalled the days he filled asses daily thanks to his thick rod. &quot;I-it&#39;s likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Ajax&#39;s dungeon, so I could try to navigate us all through and find him. I can walk through safe, but not you.&quot; Charlon was aware from his trinkets including Master Ajax&#39;s symbol and his form was what his &quot;stealth&quot; amounted to in this place, no matter how thick he was, he could easily guide them all. The problem was that his party was not Ajax&#39;s loyal soldiers, so they would become the golem&#39;s targets even with Charlon in the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to take a long rest and prepare,&quot; Gregory spoke up, the lithe mink prince paced around looking at the place. They were tired, and they were looking to find the rest of the Diamond Hollow residents and even Rodrigo, but they can&#39;t do it now. There were more golems at the front and while Charlon could handle them, he was more looking forward to tonight&#39;s long rest with the party. &quot;Need to get Veles&#39; trimming magic ready for when we meet Rodrigo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlon nodded, and they all ran back to the first room where the secret room was. <br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
<br />
Veles waited for Charlie when the whole world rippled, an effect when someone significant in their past was trimmed. He couldn&#39;t resist much since it was a total retcon, hoping that whatever it was didn&#39;t include Charlie. His magic was at an all-time low and tonight&#39;s long rest should be able to get everyone ready for the next fight, and quickly trim Rodrigo if he was somewhere Charlie triangulated. <br />
<br />
Heavy footsteps resounded but muffled from where Charlie had gone to, but the moment a bone-white furred pitbull warrior rounded the corner, Oswin pulled up a bow only to realize it was Charlon. Their resident Paranor warrior that&#39;s guiding them to the depths to defeat his old master Ajax.<br />
<br />
Veles even with his muscular cougar form wasn&#39;t a match to the brutish yet lithe form of Charlon, having lived two lives of different styles, one of brutish strength and then of speedy cunning. His techniques every night ever since they arrived in this world were heavenly, stretching out his ass whenever they rested. The thick pitwolf&#39;s cum sloshed around inside his ass for a whole day, the virile essence of old Paranor pumped directly into him. <br />
<br />
Charlon was unique, his backstory of having a wolfdog of a pitbull warrior and a wolf rogue was interesting to Finn when he first gave his backstory. Charlie the player had been the best of all of them, it was no wonder Finn was giving Charlon the character some leeway in this story.<br />
<br />
They all arrived to the safe room that they could rest in, tonight was going to be a long night...</p>
