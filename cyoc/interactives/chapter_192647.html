<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Even rose with energy to spare. Going into the bathroom, he took a quick shower and examined himself in the mirror. His beard had grown in further but could not be call a full one yet. However, the amount of hair on his body had definitely grown.<br />
	<br />
Where before Evan only had a few wisps under his arms, Even now sported hair pits. A treasure tail of hair lead up from his groin along his flat stomach and ended with a light smattering on his chest. Evan could also see that the hair on his arms and legs had thickened considerably. <br />
	<br />
However, it was how sore his body felt that was the focus of his thoughts. Everything hurt, from his toes all the up to the crown of his body. Each and every muscle felt like it had been put through the wringer. And for all the aches, Evan needed to do something with his body.<br />
	<br />
Having never been very athletic throughout his life, Evan looked around his room. Posters of movies decorated his with bookshelves filled with books and other odds and ends. But Evan knew where he could get at least some free weights.<br />
	<br />
Evan’s brother had left for college the year before. Being a member of the soccer team, Evan knew that his brother had some weights sitting in his room in a corner. Slipping out of his room, Evan entered his brothers domain. If his brother, John, knew that Evan was in his room, he would have knocked Evan into next week. <br />
	<br />
Looking around, Evan spied the free weights in the far corner. Taking them into his room, Evan started using lifting and moving the dumbbells the same way his brother had. Evan was soon starting to relax, feeling his muscles stretch, reducing the soreness in his muscles. By the time he felt the last of the pain recede, Evan had built up a strong oder and was forced to take another shower.<br />
	<br />
At breakfast, Evan surprised his mother when he asked for more food. He was ravenous, heaping eggs sausage on his plate, scarfing down three pieces of toast and downing an eight ounce glass of milk. He sat back in his chair with a satisfied smile when his mother quipped, “Growing boys need to eat.”<br />
	<br />
School was much the same as it was the previous day. Dylan did not seem interested in the fact that Evan was starting to form a beard. However, Evan did give one of his classes his undivided attention. PE. Where before, Evan always dreaded the period just before lunch, today, the class was working in the weight room.<br />
	<br />
The teacher started the class out by showing the students how to properly lift and move the various weights so as not to hurt themselves, and he asked the students to volunteer to use them. To everyones surprised, Evan quickly raised his hand.<br />
	<br />
“Can I try coach?” Evan asked.<br />
	<br />
“Come on up, and let’s see if you have absorbed the information.”<br />
	<br />
Evan began a little hesitant as he moved the dumbbells, but with the coach standing beside him, Evan was quickly getting into the groove. This was when the coach dispersed the class for them to try things out.<br />
	<br />
For the entire class, Evan methodically moved from one muscle group to another, trying to get the most out of his time during the class. Evan had no idea where this sudden need to exercise was coming from, but as he showered after class, Evan was enjoying the burn feel in his muscles.<br />
	<br />
Going to lunch, Evan uncharacteristically piled his tray with as much food as possible. He took so much food, he almost did not have time to finish it all. Afterwards as he walked down the halls towards his next class, Evan could not help but notice the numerous hot girls he walked by. Within a few moments, he had a raging boner.<br />
	<br />
Going to the restrooms, Evan quickly locked himself into a stall and started rub his incessant member. Up, down, Evan walked his cock grown to full mast, and maybe even farther. Finally, when Evan thought he could not hold it back anymore, he exploded. Not once, not twice, not even three times. Evan climax four times before he was completely spent. The walls and toilet were covered with his seed.<br />
<br />
It was at that moment that the bell for class rang out. Grabbing some toilet paper, Evan quickly realized that his cleaning attempts were hopeless and he was going to be late. Evan pulled his pants up, but for some reason, they did not seem to fit the same way they had that morning.<br />
	<br />
Ignoring the oddity of his jeans, Evan rushing to class, late by a few moments. Unfortunately, for the rest of the day, Evan had the same brother. In between each of his classes, Evan’s tool demanded some action. Evan almost didn’t make it though some of his classes, his member being so energetic.<br />
	<br />
Getting home from school, Evan immediately went and started using his brother’s dumbbells. He could not get the memory of exercising during PE out of his mind. It was two hours later when his mother called Evan for dinner that he finally forced himself to stop.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
This change in his schedule continued for the rest of the week. Evan would wake up and work out for an hour before he took a shower and looked at how much his beard had developed. On Friday as he was studying his full thick beard, Evan noticed something else that was different. His body hair, while not spreading farther, was far more dense, and it was leading down to a much larger scrotum than he remembered. On top of that, as Evan was getting dress for school, he found that most of his clothes were too small for his body. Hi jeans left a few inches exposed and his shirts looked like they were ready to tare at the seams. <br />
	<br />
Not minding the changes overcoming his body, Evan put on his larges clothes and headed down for a mammoth breakfast. Even while in the gym, Evan was extra dedicated to lifting the weights, also making sure that he was getting the maximum benefit. This would then be followed by a massive lunch, and throughout the day, Evan was constantly distracted by the many hot girls and guys he was passing in the halls.<br />
	<br />
It was the next Monday, when the class was heading to the showers that coach pulled Evan to the side. Most of the male teachers had also agreed to do no-shave-November, but the coach being the military man he was had refused. This meant that Evans and more hair on his face than his coach.<br />
	<br />
“Son. I’m really liking your new enthusiasm in my class, but I was wondering where this was all coming from?”<br />
	<br />
“I don’t know coach,” Evan said, anxious to take a shower so he could go and grab some food. “I just have felt really full of energy lately, and exercise seems to be the only way I can get rid of some of it.”<br />
	<br />
“I understand,” The coach said with a knowing smile. “I was just wondering if there was anything else you would want to put this energy towards. Like maybe join one of the sports teams here at school. It would help with this problem and also have some interaction with your classmates. I’ve noticed that you don’t seem to talk to a lot of people.”<br />
	<br />
A little embarrassed, “I’m not very good at speaking with other people, but I’ll think about what you said.” Then asking while trying to seem uninterested, “By the way, what team would you suggest?”<br />
	<br />
“How about soccer.” The coach said with a knowing grin.<br />
	<br />
Scrunching his face, “My brother was on the soccer team.”<br />
	<br />
“We also have baseball, basketball, track and field, and of course football.”<br />
	<br />
Getting a distant look, “Football. Huh. Maybe.”<br />
	<br />
“Well, why don’t you think about it for a couple of days.” Scrunching his nose at the unpleasant smell Evan was giving off, “In the mean time, hit the showers. You’re going to need a lot of fuel.”<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Walking down the hall to his next class, Evan accidentally bumped into Dylan. Evan had not been really paying attention because he could not get the idea the coach had planted out of his head.<br />
	<br />
Evan had not spoken to Dylan in the week since Dylan had dismissed Evan’s sudden facial hair appearing. Evan had been disappointed and a little angry that his friend could so easily ignore something Evan had thought considered monumental.<br />
	<br />
“Oh. Uh. Sorry about that.” Dylan said not recognizing Evan.<br />
	<br />
“It’s okay, Dylan. How you been, dude?”<br />
	<br />
“Do I know you?”<br />
	<br />
“Well, I hope so, we’ve been friends for a while.”<br />
	<br />
Suddenly, the confusion that had covered Dylan’s face was transformed into shock. “Evan?”<br />
	<br />
“Hey.”<br />
	<br />
Dylan couldn’t believe what he was seeing. His friend, that he had know for years, was sporting a very thick beard, and after a moment, Dylan even realized that Evan was now the taller of the two. “W-what happened to you?”<br />
	<br />
“I grew a beard. What does it look like?” <br />
	<br />
“B-but your taller too.”<br />
	<br />
“Well yeah. I’m sixteen. It’s kind of what we do. What’s the matter with you?”Evan asked, the quizzical expression on his face particularly hidden my his beard.<br />
	<br />
“But … but …” Dylan could not find the words. Dylan could see that Evan had grown at almost half a foot, putting Evan well over six feet tall, yet for some reason, Evan simply was brushing it aside.<br />
	<br />
“Bro, I know I’ve grown some. Mom had to go and get me a bunch of new clothes over the weekend. But it’s nothing to get all worked up about.” Then with a grin, “But check out my beard. It looks like it will be at least three inches long by the end of the month.”<br />
	<br />
What Evan had no idea about was because of the potion, his body had been forced to find a way to grow his beard. This meant that his testosterone levels were greatly increased. It was the reason his libido was some much more active, he was suddenly interested in working out. His body was being forced to mature very quickly. It wasn’t that Evan was aging, just that Evan’s body was forced to catch up with his beard growth.<br />
	<br />
“Well … see you later, Dylan.” Evan said somewhat weirded out by the way that his friend was acting.</p>
