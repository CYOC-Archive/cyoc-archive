<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Father Winston sat in his office in the church. He couldn't keep his eyes off the jar he had put the necklace in. He was puzzled by the lack of reaction from the necklace when it came in contact with the Holy Water. There should have been some reaction. He knew that his faith was absolute and unshakable and he had blessed the water himself. So why was there no reaction?<br />
<br />
There was a knock on his door and a man asked &quot;Are you busy Father Winston?&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Winston got up and went to the door. When he opened it he found one of his parishioners there. His name was Alex and it seemed like he had been chosen to deliver messages from the angels to him. As usual Alex seemed uncomfortable talking to him. &quot;Do you have another message for me Alex?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Alex said. &quot;I came to see you because a friend of mine wants to convert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wonderful&quot; Father Winston said smiling. &quot;All who want to follow God are welcome here. I look forward to seeing him tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wants to meet you tonight&quot; Alex said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he here?&quot; Father Winston asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn't want to leave his home at night&quot; Alex said. &quot;Could you go see him tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid that I'm unable to tonight&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;I have to plan out tomorrow's sermon and prepare for two exorcisms tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two exorcisms?&quot; Alex asked taking an involuntary step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid so&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;It seems that demonic forces have tainted another of our young parishioners.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you can free her and Marry&quot; Alex said. &quot;I need to go home and check on my family. I'll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May God be with you&quot; Father Winston said in his traditional parting. As soon as Alex left he closed the door and muttered &quot;That was strange. How did he know about Harry?&quot; He also couldn't help but notice the involuntary step back he took with the mention of two exorcisms. His gave one again rested on the jar. Was it possible that he could be wrong? Could it be that Harry wasn't possessed? It didn't seem possible. Harry was born a boy. He had baptized him himself. Why did Harry become a girl if he wasn't possessed?<br />
<br />
Father Winston closed his eyes and prayed for guidance. When he opened them they immediately fell upon the jar and the soft glow around it. That was where his answer lay. Now he just needed to figure out the answer. He went to the jar, opened it, and took out the necklace. The Holy Water was clear and there was no damage done to the necklace. That shouldn't be if the necklace was imbued with evil. So if the necklace wasn't imbued with evil then it stood to reason that Harry wasn't possessed. Harry's reaction had seemed to corroborate his position that the necklace was the source of power. Now it seemed that he was wrong.<br />
<br />
Father Winston thought back to when Alex first came to him with a message from the angels. He was nervous and seemed uncomfortable. At the time Father Winston thought he was that way because he was overwhelmed by the visitation. It was that first message that convinced Father Winston that all the mysticals were of Satan. Now Father Winston looked back on Alex's behavior with a question on his mind.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Father Winston knew that Alex was the one that was possessed. It made so much sense now. Alex had started to refuse taking the host claiming that he had developed an allergy to the wine. It explains why he was always uncomfortable in church. Father Winston went down to his knees and prayed &quot;Forgive me Lord for I have been led astray.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Winston felt a presence around him. He didn't know if it was good or evil but he had to have faith that it was good. After a few seconds a voice that was both masculine and feminine said &quot;You are forgiven.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Winston looked at the necklace still in his hands and he could feel it's power. It wasn't the power he associated with God but it wasn't evil either. It was neutral and could be used for either good or evil. He would have to have faith that Harriette would use it for good. He would have to give it back to her tomorrow. It didn't escape his notice that he was referring to Harriette by her new name and gender.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Alex approached his pack leader and bowed. The leader asked &quot;Where is the priest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wouldn't come&quot; Alex said. &quot;He said he was busy preparing for tomorrow's sermon and two exorcisms.&quot;<br />
<br />
The leader wasn't too happy with this news but he had known that this might happen. He would have to get the priest out of his church another way and he knew just how to do it. &quot;Your wife and daughter will stay home tomorrow&quot; he said to Alex. &quot;You will approach Father Winston tomorrow and tell him that you suspect that your daughter is possessed. That will be enough to bring that fool to your house where I will be waiting to convert him.&quot; He let out a long evil laugh.<br />
<br />
Another of the wolves approached him and said &quot;I have some news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Nancy?&quot; the leader asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have found out that the older girl is not a true part of the group&quot; Nancy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; the leader asked growing excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Her necklace is different from the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not enough&quot; the leader said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have also learned that she came from America&quot; Nancy said. &quot;The only reason she's here is that her parents died and the only family she had left was here in England.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile spread across the leader's face. &quot;Good work Nancy&quot; he said. &quot;I knew it would be worth the time to spy on them. So it seems that there are only two that are together. We need to make sure that they don't find the fourth girl and keep Marry away.&quot;</p>
