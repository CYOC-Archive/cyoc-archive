<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan blinked in surprise as the pop-up disappeared and the main menu reappeared, looking almost identical to before. He leaned back in his chair, his mind racing with possibilities. A program that could supposedly change his physical appearance and attributes, and it seemed to have access to his personal data and surroundings. It was both terrifying and thrilling.<br />
<br />
He glanced at the &#39;Animal&#39; and &#39;Inanimate&#39; options, shuddering slightly at the thought of being transformed into something so fundamentally different from human. No, he told himself, he would start small, with the &#39;Human&#39; option.<br />
<br />
Scrolling through the sub-categories, Aidan paused at the &#39;Genitals&#39; heading. A wry smile crossed his face as he thought about some of the more...unconventional fantasies he had entertained. He had always been curious about what it would be like to experience the world from a different perspective, to feel things in a whole new way. He wanted a vagina.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, Aidan clicked on the &#39;Genitals&#39; sub-category and scrolled down to the option that had caught his eye. Before he could second-guess himself, he muttered &quot;Select&quot; and hit enter. He had left the “realistic change” option selected. The Chronivac would come up with a reality change that would fit the world around him and generate a believable story to accommodate his wishes. Of course, Aidan has no idea what this meant.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a blinding flash of light filled the room, and Aidan felt a strange, tingling sensation spreading through his lower half. He gasped, gripping the edges of his chair tightly as the feeling intensified.<br />
<br />
When the light faded, Aidan found himself in a sterile white room, wearing nothing but a loose hospital gown.<br />
<br />
Aidan blinked rapidly, his eyes adjusting to the bright fluorescent lights of the hospital room. He looked down at himself, still in a state of shock as he took in the sight of his nude body draped in a thin, papery gown. The last thing he remembered was sitting at his desk, messing around with some weird software on his computer. Now he was here, in what appeared to be a pre-operative holding area.<br />
<br />
A nurse entered the room, smiling warmly at Aidan. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, sweetheart. The doctor will be in to see you shortly to go over the procedure one more time before we take you into surgery.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s heart raced as the reality of the situation sank in. He was about to undergo a life-changing operation, one that would alter his most intimate anatomy. A part of him wanted to scream and run, to take back his wish. But another part, a deeper part, felt a strange sense of excitement and anticipation.<br />
<br />
Just then, the door opened and a doctor entered, chart in hand. He was an older man with a kind smile and a gentle demeanor. &quot;Good morning, Mr. Starns. I&#39;m Dr. Hoffman, the surgeon who will be performing your procedure today. I understand you have some questions, so let me address them now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor sat down on the edge of the bed, his eyes meeting Aidan&#39;s. &quot;Firstly, let me assure you that you are in excellent hands. I have performed countless vaginoplasties with great success. The team here is highly skilled and experienced in these procedures.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan nodded, trying to absorb the information. The doctor continued, &quot;The procedure itself will take around 3-4 hours. We&#39;ll be using a penile inversion technique, which involves inverting your penis and scrotum to create the new vaginal and urethral structures. Afterwards, you&#39;ll need to stay in the hospital for 3-5 days for monitoring and to start the healing process. I&#39;ll prescribe you pain medication and antibiotics to manage any discomfort and prevent infection.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused, letting Aidan take in the details. &quot;I know this is a big step, but I want you to know that you&#39;re making a very personal and courageous decision. You&#39;ll be able to live as your true self, free from the discomfort and distress caused by gender dysphoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor patted Aidan&#39;s shoulder reassuringly. &quot;We&#39;ll give you a few minutes to compose yourself before we take you to the operating room. The sedative we gave you to calm your nerves should be kicking in any moment now. We&#39;re here to support you every step of the way.&quot; With that, he stood up and exited the room, leaving Aidan alone with his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Aidan took a deep breath, trying to calm the racing of his heart. He knew this was what he asked the Chronivac for, but didn’t realize this was how he’d be getting his wish.<br />
<br />
He glanced down at his bulge. The thought of it being gone, replaced by something soft and welcoming, sent a shiver down his spine. He imagined the smooth, delicate folds, the warm, moist heat that would soon reside there. A soft moan escaped his lips as he pictured a thick, hard length sliding into that new, secret space, filling and stretching him in ways he had only ever fantasized about.<br />
<br />
Aidan felt a wave of drowsiness wash over him as the sedative began to take effect. The bright lights of the hospital room started to blur and fade, his eyelids growing heavy. He blinked slowly, trying to stay awake, but the exhaustion and nervousness of the moment proved too much.<br />
<br />
As he drifted off, Aidan&#39;s mind raced with a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. This wasn&#39;t at all how he had imagined his wish coming true. He had expected to wake up with a vagina in the comfort of his own bed, not in a sterile hospital room on the verge of a major surgery. But despite the unexpected circumstances, Aidan couldn&#39;t deny the thrill of excitement that coursed through him.<br />
<br />
He pictured himself walking down the street, feeling the soft breeze on his bare, smooth thighs and the delicate folds of his new vagina. He imagined the way his clothes would feel different, the way he would move and carry himself with newfound grace and confidence.<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s breathing slowed as he succumbed to the sedative, his eyelids fluttering closed. He knew that when he woke up, his life would be forever changed, and he was ready to embrace it with open arms.<br />
<br />
As the anesthesia took hold and Aidan slipped into a deep, dreamless sleep, the hospital staff began to prepare him for surgery. The room fell silent, save for the soft beeping of the heart monitor and the gentle hum of the air conditioning.</p>
