<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Life for Tami became a bit weird for a while. Samantha had taken the liberty to continue treating her like a dog when in public. This meant that Tami had to not only be leashed, but also collared too. Plus, Samantha had actually taken her to the vet and got her chipped. And no matter how much Tami told the vet she wasn&#39;t a dog, all they heard was barking.<br />
<br />
Samantha sorta felt a little bit bad for her husband, though she hid it pretty well from him. She knew it technically wasn&#39;t actually 100% his fault. And now he had to become a mother, though that is something that they both have to do. But her return prank was was made him like this. <br />
<br />
Tami just laid down on her &quot;bed&quot;, a pink fluffy dog bed which Samantha had purchased for her, and moped. Partially because of what was happening to her right now, but also due to just being bored. Her hands didn&#39;t work quite right, and her dog-like skeletal structure made using the computer nearly impossible. She could watch TV, but that was about it. Leaving the house could land her in the pound if she was mistaken for a stray. Something she really didn&#39;t want to have to go through.<br />
<br />
She felt the need to pee and got up. She had almost made it to the bathroom before remembering where she now had to go, and sighed, turning around and passing through the doggy door into the back yard. It was degrading and humiliating having to squat to pee. But that was how she had to do it now. When she was finished, she walked back inside and back to her bed. <br />
<br />
She disliked how her teats swung beneath her. They already were becoming much more pronounced, turning into breasts as they slowly filled with more and more milk by the day. Though the same thing was happening to Samantha too, so there was a small silver lining. <br />
<br />
While she lied there, Max trotted over and upon seeing her, ran over and curled up right behind her, then rested his head on her neck. She hated how much she felt at peace whenever he did this to her. She knew that for the current Max, she was his bitch, and while she never would admit it outright, it felt good knowing that she was his. That her wombs were full of his puppies. That he had claimed her virginity as a woman. She wondered if Samantha felt the same way? <br />
<br />
Part of Tami wondered if she herself would be ok with fully going back to being a human man. She would be crushing Max&#39;s heart if she did. But she wasn&#39;t a dog to begin with. But then why did it make her feel so guilty? <br />
<br />
A little after 6pm, the door opened and Samantha returned home from work. Tami got up and made her way over to greet her wife, but not as she would have liked to. Stuck on all fours, she tried to jump up and use Samantha for support in order to kiss her, but only managed to lick her face before she couldn&#39;t maintain her balance and dropped back down to the floor. Samantha petted her head sympathetically, and decided to return her mobility, having felt that a week as little more than a bitch was a long enough punishment. She would still be a dog&#39;s bitch, but at least could be a dog&#39;s bitch with the bodily mobility of a human.<br />
<br />
After making the change, she noticed that even though she no longer had to, Tami still moved about on all fours, having gotten quite used to moving around like that. Tami could do things on two legs though and was at least happy to be able to use the toilet. Though her tail made it a tad bit more difficult. <br />
<br />
She still went around naked too. And even while standing on 2 legs, she was still treated as a dog, which was alright now for her after a week of getting used to it. <br />
<br />
It was when Samantha would take her and Max out on walls where things became complicated. Any dog they passed had to sniff her and Max, and she had to always return the action in kind. And whenever she passed by a scent that grabbed her attention, she had to pee on it.<br />
<br />
A pair of months like this passed by, and both women are notably pregnant. Tami&#39;s boobs are also fully formed, with a few rows of DD-cups hanging heavily beneath her body. Samantha&#39;s boobs also are bigger, but having only the one pair, made her much more normal looking. <br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t leave the house that much as of late either, as they were unsure of when exactly they would be giving birth. Both bitches only hoped that it would soon be over with. They were sick of being pregnant with puppies of all things.</p>
