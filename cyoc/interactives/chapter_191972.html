<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel was waiting in a nice reception area while the papers he handed to the receptionist was being processed. He honestly couldn&#39;t believe he was in bimbo academy and that he was going to become one. Gabriel thought back to how it had happened.<br />
<br />
When he had gotten a job at the new bar that had opened in town, he never imagined why they were very lax when it came to hiring, but he needed the job so he took it. He went in to the interview thinking he would be turned away only to be surprised when the boss herself Cassia proposed to him. He remembers how fast she dated him when he said no, she made it clear that she wanted to marry him and only him and wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer. they got married a month later, during the honeymoon she explained to him the reason why she opened a bar. she said that she wanted to hire all of her bullies from high school and turn them into mindless bimbo servers, and that she had decided she would marry the first person she doesn&#39;t know that came in looking for a job. she went on to say that she had kept taps on her bullies so she could know when their lives where in the gutter and thus offer them a job. <br />
She had clearly planned this for a while even securing ties with bimbo academy to get a bulk discount on transforming her bullies into the perfect bimbo waitresses. She made it also clear she was desperate for love so during the honeymoon we quickly found our shared kinks.<br />
But the more recent development that got him here was that she wanted to be domed by a lamia and had even went out to become a herm without telling him, this had upsetted him for a few days but Cassia convinced him that female bodies where way better then male bodies, so he agreed as long as he doesn&#39;t become a dumb bimbo. Cassia happily agreed saying she had no plans on making him dumb, but made it clear that all his courses will be either clothing related or sex related. She had made the made the application for bimbo academy in front of him, but she did warn him that even though she is making clear to the academy that he wasn&#39;t to become dumb bimbo he might temporarily lose some IQ points during his stay there but he will recover after at least a week from graduating and staying at home. Gabriel recalled a summary of the application made: <br />
Name: Gabriel  <br />
Species: Human  <br />
Gender: Male  <br />
Bimbo output: a Lamia Bimbo sex addicted wife with no changes to IQ and will act like a Dom in bed.<br />
Name: Rose<br />
Species: Lamia<br />
Sponsor: Cassia&#39;s Bimbo Bar.<br />
<br />
The finer details were lost somewhere in his memory. <br />
<br />
Gabriel spent 5 minutes recalling all of that before the normal looking receptionist called to him breaking him out of trying to remember every detail of the application. &quot;ok I have processed your application. now please take this necklace that will have all your information regarding what you are here for and for security measures, then head to the right, up the stairs, down to door that has Headmistress on it, she will give you more info.&quot; Gabriel nodded to the receptionist grabbing the necklace and followed her directions to the Headmistress office. Gabriel gave a knock on the door and waited for a few seconds before the door opened and he stepped inside. <br />
Gabriel saw a nice lavender colored room with a large set of windows facing inward to a courtyard in the middle of the building, a large office desk colored the same as the room and three chairs around it. standing next to the desk was a bimbo with gravity defying breasts wearing a classic office worker clothes but with a miniskirt instead of a knee length pencil skirt, and next to her was another bimbo with smaller breasts wearing a slutty police officer uniform.<br />
<br />
The bimbo with the office clothes said &quot;welcome to bimbo academy, you must be the new applicant.&quot; Gabriel said yes in response and she continued &quot;well then I&#39;m Venus, I&#39;m the headmistress of this academy, I have looked through your application and I find it so endearing seeing a loving husband willing to go through such a change for his wife, so you will be treated well by the staff during your stay here, but I must warn you not every student in this academy is here out of their own volition.&quot; Venus then went on to explain that people who come to the academy willingly get the same jeweled necklace that I had in my hands, while those that don&#39;t get a collar, the outside is guarded by male staff while inside the academy is guarded by bimbos, and that everyone lives in dorm rooms of 4. Venus then explained that thanks to my wife&#39;s ties with her, she will be assigning a guard to be one of my roommates and guide. Said guard then clearly couldn&#39;t keep her excitement down any longer quickly introduced herself &quot; Like Hi I&#39;m Like Vivi, I&#39;ll be like the Bestest big sister in here you ever had!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Venus apparently didn&#39;t mind the interruption, giggly a little at Vivi&#39;s intro. Venus then said &quot; all that&#39;s left to do Mr. Gabriel is to but on the necklace and then Vivi will help you to your dorm where you will meet your other 2 roommates. Oh and Vivi remember the schedule, give enough time for everyone to settle into the dorms and get acquainted with each other, then help them to dinner, then shower time, and lastly bed time.&quot; &quot;Oke doke Mistress Venus.&quot; said Vivi as she gave a short salute o7. <br />
<br />
With nothing left Gabriel looked at the necklace, it looked plain, the only thing of note was the ruby in the middle of it. Gabriel but on the necklace and Vivi quickly grabbed his hand, dragging Gabriel through the academy with such excitement she nearly collided with several other bimbo staff, and nearly tripped a few times too. Vivi showed Gabriel around all the academy before finally stopping at a door in the dorms. &quot;ohhhh I can&#39;t wait to see who our roomies will be!&quot; Vivi said before turning to Gabriel and motioning for him to have his necklace scanned by the door. <br />
<br />
Gabriel went forward to the scanning device and waited a few seconds before a beam of light hit the ruby on the necklace and he heard a beep as it unlocked the door for him. Gabriel saw the room was empty of people at the moment so he step inside with Vivi right behind him. Gabriel and Vivi waited a minute before their new roommates entered, Gabriel and Vivi introduced themselves and the two new arrivals introduced themselves as......</p>
