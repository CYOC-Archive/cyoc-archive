<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">          Jeff rocked back and forth to Liz’s steady rhythm, the metronomic sway of her hips nearly putting him to sleep. But something didn’t feel right. Liz cringed as she felt a slightly painful rumble in her stomach. It didn&#39;t last long, but something had moved inside her. It snaked its way through her intestines, growing ever closer to her asshole, Jeff being none the wiser. Suddenly, Jeff felt something rising out of his throat. Almost instinctually, his lips tightened, ready for whatever she threw at him. The air mass left his throat and filled his mouth, a sickeningly hot and bitter taste sinking into his tastebuds. As the pressure mounted and the taste grew more and more horrible, Jeff held it in, the war becoming less about not embarrassing Liz and more about not letting some ass gas get the better of him. The battle was hard fought, lasting all of a minute as Liz and her mom crossed the large parking lot. But then, Liz lifted her leg to step onto the sidewalk, and it was all over.<br />
          Behind Liz, her usual jiggle was thrown off by a sudden rumble between her cheeks, the sound creating its own chaotic rhythm as it passed through the shifting valley. For four, gruelling seconds, the anal winds shook Jeff this way and that, his lips burning from a combination of seasoning and the strength it took to hold it back. Liz paused and looked behind her, startled by how big it&#39;d been.<br />
          “That was a loud one, Jeff,” she blushed, rubbing his cheek. She&#39;d felt something building up inside her, but hadn&#39;t expected it to be that big! Smelling the awful fart and feeling her asshole burn a bit, she felt kinda bad for him. Jeff, on the other hand, didn&#39;t regret his choice in body part at all. He was more than happy with combating against the worst of farts if it meant he got to be with the girl of his dreams. On top of that, if she was going to pet him every time, he&#39;d fight forever.<br />
          “We shouldn’t have had Mexican last night,” said her mom, stifling a laugh. A bell chimed as she opened the front door, “You should take a bathroom break before we start.”<br />
          Cautiously, Liz handed her mom the mats, “You&#39;re probably right.” She walked off towards the showers, another fart shaking Jeff to his core. From his perspective, each fart felt like their own individual earthquake. Where her walking had been rhythmic and predictable, soothing even, her farts would send uneven waves radiating out of his mouth, moving him this way and that.<br />
          Liz blushed and quickened her pace, helping Jeff tighten his mouth as much as she could. While this stopped the gas, it only made it worse for Jeff, giving him all the more time to experience their sour, musty taste. But she couldn&#39;t hold it forever, and when she did let go, they were even more powerful.<br />
          Jeff&#39;s mouth finally opened, and out came the rankest and most disgusting fart Jeff or Liz had ever smelled. &quot;Oh God,&quot; Liz said under her breath, her panties struggling to contain the power of the gas. Luckily, no one was close by, or Liz thought she&#39;d&#39;ve died of embarrassment. Pushing open the door, she jogged towards the bathroom. As the door squeaked open, Liz was hit with a scent combination of lilac and fish. Her frown deepened as she tried to block out both of the terrible smells, pinching her nose shut with her fingers. Jeff, however, was almost completely unaware of the change of scenery, the foul smelling cloud dulling his other senses and stopping the bathroom&#39;s scent in its tracks.<br />
          When Liz had entered the bathroom, she also stopped helping Jeff stop her gas, concentrating on getting to the bathroom instead. He felt the change immediately, Liz&#39;s asshole loosening from his grip as he let loose the most powerful fart of his entire life. As he shook about, he began to feel even more nauseous than he already had been, a new pressure building up further back in his throat. With a loud cough, he felt the blockage fill his mouth, a burning sensation beginning to take hold.<br />
          Liz limped into the bathroom and pushed her way into a stall. Pulling down her pants and panties, she sat down and sighed with relief.<br />
          Jeff blinked as he was enveloped by light, his protective layers sliding away, exposing him the cool air of the outside world. He barely had time to process this before it got darker again, a cold ring pressed to Liz&#39;s squishy ass as he stared into a white pool. A final burst of air left his mouth before the log slowly started sliding out. Unfortunately, as soon as it began, it stopped, the log lodging in his lips. The burning feeling spread to the entirety of his mouth, a quiet whimper escaping around it.<br />
          Liz hunched over and groaned as she felt the burning from her asshole grow stronger and stronger by the second. She looked back at her now silent passenger, her hips extending past the rim of the bowl. She couldn&#39;t imagine the Hell that he was going through. She reasoned that she couldn&#39;t just let him suffer more or less alone, so she gently placed her hands on her hips. Slowly, she began to rub her ass in small circles. “Shhhh, it’s okay, Jeff, it’s okay. Stay calm,” she cooed, trying to make her voice as calming as possible, hoping she was at least comforting him. She got her answer a second later, as a soft, warm wave washed up through her. She wasn&#39;t exactly sure what it meant, but it felt like a good sign. She continued, placing her hands flat against his sides, “I need you to be the nice, large ass that you are now, and do what you need to do.”<br />
          Jeff blushed as he heard her talk about him. Hearing her refer to him as nothing more than her nice, large ass made him as hard as something so soft could be. Back to the matter at hand, his first idea was to try and cut it down to size. He took a deep breath and stared intensely at the empty bowl. With as much strength as he could muster, he tightened his lips. But, despite his best efforts, nothing seemed to happen. He tried and tried, but still nothing happened. Jeff groaned in pain as he stopped, his mouth now both sore and burning.<br />
          Liz grunted quietly and rubbed him a bit more, relaxing her asshole, “Okay, new idea: just push.”<br />
          Liz and Jeff both pushed, but it seemed to Liz like Jeff wasn’t trying as hard as he could be. The last attempt must have left him a bit drained. She pat either side of her ass and tried to sound as motivating as possible, “Come on, Jeff, I need you to be the big, strong ass that I know you can be!” When she said that, she felt a wave of energy radiate through her, as if complimenting her own ass had made her stronger. A smile curled up her cheek as she looked back at her huge, radiant ass. She rubbed her ass cheeks together for a second before asking them, “Are you ready now, my big, beautiful butt?”<br />
          Liz&#39;s eyes widened as she felt her ass begin to push all by itself, a happy wave of energy radiating from her behind. In fact, she was so surprised that she forgot to help push, instead lightly rubbing her ass in admiration. Finally, the log began to move. It slowly slid out of her, her ass copying her rhythmic motions to push. Then, with a loud splash, Liz&#39;s asshole was hit with a splash of water, which did little to cool the burn. Nevertheless, Liz and her asshole both sighed in relief, Liz sitting back up and opening the flood gates. A bit out of breath, Liz chuckled to herself. Placing a hand on her behind, she said, “You&#39;re the best butt a girl could ask for, you know that Jeff?”<br />
          Jeff&#39;s heart would&#39;ve skipped a beat as she said that, a feeling of completeness that he couldn&#39;t explain filling his entire being. He felt her quiet laugh reverberate through his entire body, his skin rippling as she pat him.<br />
          Liz could feel his waves of love and affection move through her. She&#39;d never thought someone could love being an ass as much as he was, specifically hers. Her ass was so chubby, and bubbly, and stretched out all her clothes. How could he love something like that? ‘Maybe,’ she though, ‘he just loves being a part of me.’ She quietly wiped herself clean, her ass sending waves the entire time. Flushing the toilet, she felt like she had to address the issue.<br />
          Placing a hand on either one of her ass cheeks, she rubbed them once again, psyching herself up for the confrontation. “So, you must really like being my ass, huh Jeff?”<br />
          She felt the change immediately, his waves cutting off abruptly. She smiled nervously, knowing she probably ruined his experience. Well, as much as you can ruin an experience where literal shit comes out of your mouth. She continued, “It&#39;s okay, Jeff. I&#39;m not mad at you. I just didn&#39;t expect this to happen to me. Especially someone becoming my massive eye sore of an ass.”<br />
          Jeff was shocked. Liz&#39;s entire body looked like it was personally sculpted by Aphrodite in her own image. But her ass looked and felt as if she&#39;d been designed to look like what Aphrodite had wanted to look like. Her ass was softer than feathers and each cheek was larger than a watermelon! How could she say such a thing?<br />
          Liz felt new waves from him, but they felt different from before. They didn&#39;t convey emotions, but they meant something. She focused on them, feeling as much as she could. Then, as if with a flip of a switch, she understood what they said.<br />
          “Big.”<br />
          “Beautiful.”<br />
          “Butt.”<br />
          Liz&#39;s blush deepened as her smile turned to a shocked gasp. She was so taken aback, she also stopped rubbing her Big Beautiful Butt. She&#39;d said those words to him without even thinking about it. She&#39;d said those words to him as a form of encouragement, and now he was repeating them back. She was about to say something when the message changed.<br />
          “I. Love. Being. Your. Big. Beautiful. Butt.”<br />
          Both pairs of cheeks flushed with embarrassment, but Liz&#39;s even more so. She&#39;d known Jeff had had his crush, but she wasn&#39;t sure what to say about their unique situation.<br />
          Jeff hadn&#39;t heard or felt anything from her in a while. He hoped he hadn&#39;t crossed a line. If he had, then his next message was going to be far passed it, but it would be worth a shot.<br />
          “Your. Dazzling. Derriere. Is. To. Die. For.”<br />
          Jeff sat in silence, nothing but the buzz of the fluorescent lights to fill it. Then, he felt her pat his sides, her laugh reverberating through him. Gradually, it got louder and louder, until his entire body shook with her laughter.<br />
          Liz couldn&#39;t help but laugh. Catching her breath, she said, “I didn&#39;t know my tush was such an eloquent poet.” Waves of relief poured out of her tushie as she looked back at her rear. A behind that can talk to her. A backside that has her back. A derriere that is her next door neighbour, Jeff Rogers. She rubbed her hemispheres together, still laughing to herself, “I never thought I&#39;d laugh at anything that came out of my ass besides farts, but here I am laughing at alliteration about my Amazingly Ample Adipose made by my Tantalizing Titanic Tushie.” She could feel the comforting waves of a happy hindquarters move through her as she squeezed handfuls of her squishy self.<br />
          But all good things must come to an end. Standing up and feeling 10 pounds lighter, she realized that she&#39;d forgotten to pull up her pants or panties. She smiled to herself, “You&#39;re gonna like this, Jeff.”<br />
          Liz bent at her knees, Jeff&#39;s view slowly lowering closer and closer to the blue tiled floor. Behind his face, Jeff felt Liz&#39;s toned muscles push out against him, the pressure growing larger and larger as she knelt further down. When Liz had bent all the way down, she briefly felt the cold ground touch her tush, but it tensed up on its own, attempting to get away from the hostile environment. She quietly laughed as her legs slowly stretched back out while remaining bent at the hip. Jeff watched as the graffiti on the walls moved down and away from him until he was pointed at the ceiling, the florescent lights causing him to close his eyes, tensing Liz&#39;s cheeks a bit. Liz then grabbed onto her panties, slowly pulling them up past her toned calves, along her thick thighs, and finally onto her massive ass. Jeff felt the tense fabric stroke along her ass, digging between her cheeks so that it could fit around her waist. Then, with a flick of her wrist, the waistband snapped shut around her hips, her ass jiggling slightly from the reverb. Jeff felt the panties hug her ass like the friend it was, Jeff reciprocating by wiggling in its containment.<br />
          Liz smiled as she looked back at her Perky Plush Posterior and its perfectly content passenger. She bent down again to pick up her yoga pants. Again, she ascended slowly, letting Jeff simmer with anticipation. Liz&#39;s ass jiggled with excitement as its vision was blotted out by the dark polyester. As Liz came to a stop, the pants had already touched down across the smooth surface, almost completely wrapping it in the soft material. Then, letting go of the hem, it snapped shut. The derriere danced in place, happily absorbing all the energy from the elastic. It was very happy to be back in it&#39;s warm home.<br />
          Unlocking the stall door, Liz walked out and washed her hands. She then heard a new message coming from Jeff.<br />
          “How. Long. Have. You. Known?”<br />
          “In all honesty, I&#39;ve known about your crush on me for a while. At least a few years.” At this, she felt a twinge of embarrassment shoot up her spine from her butt. She realized that might not have been the question he was asking. She looked back at him, “Did you mean the crush or the transformation?”<br />
          “Transformation.”<br />
          “Oh. Well, I knew about that from the beginning,” she said, drying her hands, “I&#39;m not sure what my mom really thinks, though. She might just think I named my tushie Jeff or something. By the way, how did you turn into my butt?”<br />
          “Chrono. Vac.”<br />
          Liz tossed the paper towel in the garbage can, “What&#39;s a Chronovac? Some kind of vacuum cleaner?”<br />
          “Computer. Program.”<br />
          “Maybe you could show this to me later,” Liz replied, patting her ass. She wasn’t sure why, but the way she interacted with Jeff seemed really natural. Like it was meant to be.<br />
          Liz stepped out of the bathroom and back into the locker room. The locker room was still empty, but the bad smell now had added cleaning products, an unattended janitor&#39;s cart sitting in one of the rows. Liz held her nose, “Let&#39;s get to the lesson first. Hopefully we&#39;re not late.”<br />
          As Liz walked, Jeff started thinking about something: when Liz had called him all those things, talked to him like he was nothing. Well, not really nothing. She sounded sincere every time she cheered him on. She cared about what she thought as the ugliest part of her body. She cared about him. Jeff wanted to say something.<br />
          “Liz?”<br />
          Liz stopped as she reached the locker room door and looked back at Jeff, “Yeah?”<br />
          “Can. I. Call. You. Mistress?”<br />
          Liz was surprised by the question, but also felt flattered that he&#39;d call her his ‘Mistress.’ While it is true that she&#39;d technically be his mistress, since she controlled his entire body, it still seemed strange to hear. She knew that mistresses were usually dominatrixes, so maybe that&#39;s what he wanted?  “Sure thing,” she replied, a smile creeping up her face. She flexed each of her butt cheeks before pinching one and shaking it lightly, “My little cutie-patootie, but only if I can call you Tushie,” She firmly pat both of her butt cheeks, “Tushie.”<br />
           Jeff hadn&#39;t expected Liz to be so commanding, but he had to admit that he kind of liked it.<br />
           “Tushie. Agrees. Mistress.”<br />
           Their mistress smiled, “Good Tushie,” patting her tushie again, “But also, Jeff, if anything goes wrong, or I need to tell you something important, I&#39;m dropping this roleplaying thing.”<br />
           “Okay. Liz.”<br />
           “Good Tushie,” their Mistress smiled, rubbing one of her tush&#39;s cheeks with her hand. Suddenly, she slapped her tush&#39;s other cheek, slamming the two together. Her tushie flushed red as their Mistress smiled and strode confidently out of the locker room, off towards the yoga room with her bouncy, rosy-cheeked companion in tow.<br />
           Her tushie hadn&#39;t quite expected what their Mistress did, but couldn&#39;t deny that they liked it a lot. They hadn&#39;t expected their Mistress to be so forceful all of a sudden, but it wasn&#39;t their choice to decide what their Mistress wanted. As their Mistress walked, her tushie noticed they were slowly adjusting to the natural swaying of their body, their sight becoming more and more clear. Her tush looked up, down, and all around at all the equipment and people strewn here and there across the floor. They didn&#39;t know why, but the sight of everything moving away from them looked really nice. As their Mistress walked through the gym, even through the haze of her yoga pants, her tushie could see guys and girls alike staring at her Mistress and her tushie. Some of them stared with lust and longing, while others with jealousy or envy. Her tushie wasn&#39;t sure whether their Mistress noticed any of them, but right now, they didn’t really care. They were far more excited to try out yoga with her mistress for the first time, especially from her new cushiony view.</p>
