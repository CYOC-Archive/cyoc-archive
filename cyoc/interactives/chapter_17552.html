<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom stood there looking at Sue her mouth chucked full of his semen. <br />
<br />
She on the otherhand was not so thrilled by what he had endowed her with, ans began to spit it out like globs of tapioka pudding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn you, you, pervert!&quot; spit and sputtered Sue as she bend over forward and tried to spit out the salty slime which filled her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was something of mine which is all have now to give, my love!&quot; stated Tom his face beaming with satyrical pride.<br />
<br />
Choke, spit, try as she might the satyr's semen was thinning and sliding down her throat. She looked up at Tom his jaw becoming narrow and making his goatee look ever so right for his face. His two growing horns made for the most aluring feeling in her and as much as she tried to resist the longing to mate was there.<br />
<br />
The thought of a drink to wash out her mouth had Sue thinking about the babbling creek which snaked from the nearby pasture and farm. A short run and she fell to her knees, cupping her hands she scooped up the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read somewhere that those who suck, eat, or and swallow satyr's semen become they themselves as satyrs too!&quot; said Tom his satyr pride still showing on a face gathering brown shaggy fur.<br />
<br />
Sue leaned forward and cupping up another hand full of creek water she saw what Tom had said was coming true.<br />
<br />
Even before Sue could muster out a word Tom started to point at her and laughed and laughed. &quot;I told you, I did, I did, did I&quot; chidded Tom.<br />
<br />
Sue leaned forward and looked into her reflection on the creek's clear water. Like Tom she too had two bumps now on her head but more toward the sides than top and front. She eyed her face expecting to see the sprouting of goatish wool but it wasn't happening.<br />
<br />
Instead her nose and upper lip began to merge and thicken. Soon the nostrils were large and turning a deep black in colour. She smiled at her reflection seeing as she was feeling her teeth becoming larger and thicker.<br />
<br />
By now even Tom had stopped his laughter and was peering over her shoulders looking at the creek's personal reflection of his sweetheart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susie!&quot; said Tom in a slow and drawn out manner as what he had of fond hope for her to join him as, was in fact not happening as he expected.<br />
<br />
Sue's eyes rounded and got much larger as they turned a deep brown in colour. Her head was expanding greatly as jaw and teeth moved within her mouth. She moaned of some likely pains and discomfort as Tom watched her cheeks get rounded and bigger.<br />
<br />
Slowly Sue turned her heavy head to look at and up into Tom's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trrrrrrroooooooooooommmmmmmmmm!&quot; Sue bellowed out in a long drawn out call of Tom's name.<br />
<br />
As she raised her hand to shake an angered fist at him the appendage which came into view was fingers melding and merging into a black cloven hoove. Her pretty pink arm was quickly becoming covered with shaggy reddish brown long hairs as if she was some funny ape.<br />
<br />
Tom stood up and looked about wondering if anyone else had wandered close and was a witness to this wonder of wonders. As he glanced upward the eye of his gaoting form caught sight of the nearby herd of cattle. He looked down at his sweetheart in the midst of her personal transforming self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sue, your looking like Mr. Mc Henry's Scottish cattle, they are shaggy brown haired beasts and you are........&quot; said and stopped Tom as he saw Sue whence from a pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muuuuurrraaaawwwwwww!&quot; she bellowed as struggling to stand up her legs had changed as did her arms making bovine legs. She stood almost nine feet tall now and her midsection was nose high to squating satyr Tom.<br />
<br />
Pretty sexy blouse and jeans parted as then falling away Sue's beastly glory was for all to see.<br />
<br />
Tom starred at her midsection and was so stunned he reached out and took her bovine sheath in his two hands. <br />
<br />
She jerked at his touching and looked down as best she could twist her great head and oggle at the puny creature only gut high to her new size.<br />
<br />
Tom was both terrified at losing his dearest sweetheart and at the same time saw before him a sheath and cock of some Highland shaggy bull, that was Sue. It was with his very soft touch that Sue now as such a sensual bull felt herself become erect.<br />
<br />
Satyr that Tom was and had totally accepted his mutation from human to mythical monster could not resist his gay urge. He opened his mouth and stepping forward engulfed Sue's rank bovine shaft.<br />
<br />
Sue standing upright had all she could do not to fall forward and crush her lover flat. Soon weaving about in the air she bellowed as a warning of the pending fall to all fours and stand as a bull should.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yum, Hmmm!&quot; moaned Tom as he sucked on the wrinkled pink shaft of Sue's bullish cock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just like being at McDonald's&quot; mumbled Tom as the onrush of Sue's vanilla coloured semen floods out her cock and puffs out Tom's cheeks with every blast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you pervert what are you doing to my bull!&quot; yelled Mister McHenry as he came running with a shotgun in hand.<br />
<br />
Tom saw the man coming but was having real trouble deciding whether to break free and run or stay and suck, but maybe get shot!</p>
