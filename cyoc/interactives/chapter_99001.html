<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At lunch Ryan could hear girls talking about him. While they whispered at first the conversation could barely be called quiet as their voices rose over time. After finishing a sandwich he leaned back relaxing a bit and smiling over how his day was going so far. He was about to pick up his second sandwich when a girl came walking over to him. She had been seated at the table where girls were talking about him. She wasn&#39;t bad looking probably the prettiest girl body wise in the group. Her face was rather average and her hair was quite curly and wild but otherwise she looked appealing enough with decent looking thighs, somewhat proportionately long legs, quite nice curvy hips with an okay waist and more than just ample breasts. She looked him in the eyes and stutteringly began speaking to him. Her eyes were nice shade of green Ryan realized but then tried to make out what she was trying to say. <br />
<br />
Suddenly she asked &quot;You&#39;re Ryan, right?&quot; before he could figure out what she said before that question. &quot;Yeah.&quot; Ryan answered nonchalantly. The girl leaned forward causing her to show some of her cleavage seemingly unintentionally. &quot;is it really true...&quot; Ryan looked at her and grinned. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He said again almost as nonchalantly as before. She looked at his pants and stepped back rather quickly with a blush on her face, her chest unavertably bouncing from the quick movement. Ryan glanced at the concealed female flesh. &quot;Oh.&quot; She answered. Ryan felt his warm manhood starting to throb in his pants. The girl looked away and brushed her out of her face which caused her to squish her own breast a little. Ryan began to feel somewhat uncomfortable with how he was responding physically to this girl. &quot;You wanted to ask me more?&quot; Ryan said to the girl somewhat hurried. &quot;Uh...&quot; The girl looked spooked. &quot;No...&quot; She finally answered and then walked off. Ryan looked at the girl while she walked off, specifically his eyes dropped to her behind. It wasn&#39;t the fullest but those hips were attention grabbers for sure. He felt his crotch throb again the outline in his pants slightly more visible and further down his leg. <br />
<br />
He got up and grabbed his sandwich from which he took a bite. One of the guys asked where he was going. &quot;Toilet&quot; He answered and walked off continuing to his sandwich. To his surprise he met Bryan again in the hallway Bryan stopped him in his way. Bryan looked nervous.  &quot;Ryan, I have a question for you... a request, really.&quot; Ryan gulped down the last bit of his sandwich. &quot;What is it?&quot; Bryan looked around and leaned forward. &quot;Can I see how big it is when hard?&quot; Ryan smirked or grinned or a combination thereof before laughing. &quot;Well that&#39;s quite the question.&quot; Bryan shook his hands in front on Ryan. &quot;I&#39;m not gay or anything, I just... I really want to see...&quot; Ryan shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s fine I guess, I was heading off to jerk anyway, some girl started talking about my dick and I started to get hard, follow me.&quot;  He walked to a teacher and asked. &quot;Could I have the keys for the changing room, I think I forgot something in there.&quot; The teacher shrugged and gave Ryan the keys. He beckoned Ryan to come with him and both went to the changing room of the gym. He told Bryan to wait a bit and went into the changing room and looked into he gym and girls changing room to make sure nobody was there to interrupt them. He noted that his cock had stopped throbbing and wasn&#39;t quite as big any more. As he walked back to the door of the changing room where Bryan was waiting he got an idea. Ryan took Chronivac out of his bag and decided to temporarily increase his dick to 14 inches soft. He would lie to Bryan and say it was partially erect already. &quot;Battery at 67%...&quot; Quickly Ryan made the changes and put the device back into his bag.<br />
<br />
He beckoned Bryan in and and locked the door behind them. He then lowered his pants and unveiled his now 14 inch long cock. Bryan gasped. &quot;It&#39;s bigger, isn&#39;t it? Longer, certainly.&quot; Ryan grinned. &quot;This is what happens when people make me horny.&quot; Ryan leaned back and started stroking his immense length. It was quiet a task getting his beast hard especially at the start. He thought about lot&#39;s of exciting things that had happened lately. He closed his eyes as he continued rubbing. When he opened them again Bryan was uncomfortably close. &quot;Should I help?&quot; Bryan said in a way that was needlessly lustful. Ryan looked at the kids crotch and noted a small hump. &quot;No, though you said you weren&#39;t gay.&quot; Bryan stumbled back. &quot;I&#39;m not... it&#39;s just... it&#39;s so huge...&quot; Ryan grinned. &quot;Just wait...&quot; When Ryan announced it was finally fully hard he told Bryan he could come closer. He lowered his cock but kept supporting the base with his hand. &quot;That&#39;s like over 18 inches long.&quot; Bryan uttered in amazement. Ryan smirked. &quot;It&#39;s so big that it&#39;s hard to get off, amazing, huh?&quot; Bryan nodded and reached out to grab Ryan&#39;s dick. Ryan pushed him away. &quot;Nope, this thing is mine, you wanted to see it and now you&#39;ve seen it hard.&quot; Bryan sighed and then took at his own small hard-on. &quot;Can I at least get off myself while looking at you?&quot; Ryan frowned. &quot;Whatever floats your boat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps unsurprisingly Bryan managed to get off before Ryan blew his load. Ryan rubbed it&#39;s entire length with two hands sometimes pulling it against his body. He eventually felt his balls throb causing  his massive cock to start spewing cum. Even when going more flaccid it kept leaking for a while. They barely had enough time clean up before the next class came in. Some guys complained about a weird smell but in the changing room the smell of sweat covered most of it. Ryan managed to get to class on time but changing his cock back would have to wait till he was home, if he didn&#39;t forget or even wanted to change back to his slightly more manageable size. At home he pondered and decided that changing it  back wasn&#39;t worth the battery power.</p>
