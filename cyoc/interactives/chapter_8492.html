<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power - Ty and Peter's Magical First Day at School – by scriptboy and werechu<br />
<br />
Monday morning finally rolled around… It was the first day of the new school year for Ty and Dustin! And now that Peter was staying with them until Christmas, they had Peter enrolled in the same class at the same school as Ty. Most kids at the high school knew Ty, but nobody had ever heard of Peter before.<br />
<br />
Ty and Peter started out their first day in the ninth grade with a math class, which was nothing but an orientation and the reading of the attendance list. Ty knew most of the kids in his class from the eighth grade, but since Peter was from out of town, he didn’t know anyone there. So Peter decided to stick with Ty for as long as he could. This worked for the most part until the lunch hour. After that, Peter would have P.E. class while Ty had history.<br />
<br />
During lunch, Peter and Ty decided to sit at separate tables, so that they could meet some of the other kids. Ty sat with two friends of his, Aaron and Robert. Peter looked around and saw one boy sitting way in the back of the cafeteria, all alone. He was sitting at the very end of a long table, right next to the exit. Peter walked over to him and sat across from him, on the opposite side of the table. “Hey” Peter said to him, and he said “Hey” back. “How’s going? My name is Peter! I’m a new student here.” The tall, brown haired kid looked up at him. “I’m Ashley! I’m pleased to meet you!”<br />
<br />
Peter and Ashley talked a little and they got to know each other. They found out that they had all the same classes, which was great news for Peter, since he did not know anyone else. Suddenly three big boys walked through the cafeteria doors. “Fire!!!” one of them screamed, as everyone looked up. Then the three of them sat down, on the other side of the table were Peter and Ashley were sitting. <br />
<br />
“Oh no, not them…” Ashley said, as he rolled his eyes upwards. “What? Who? Who are those guys?” Peter whispered. “They are the Red Rangers. They are this evil club of bullies” he said. Then Adam, the biggest of the group, got up and walked towards Ashley, standing behind. Peter noticed that all three thugs wore red t-shirts and they all looked big, strong, and mean. Ashley suddenly became very nervous, to the point where he began to tremble when Adam stood next to him.<br />
<br />
“Hello ladies, how’s going?” Adam sneered at Ashley. Right away, Peter had a bad feeling about these three thugs. “Leave us alone, Adam! It’s a new year, I didn’t do anything, I just want to be left alone, okay?” “Listen dweeb,” Adam began, as his henchmen Keith and Dave stood next to him, “You still owe me protection money from your last month at school before the summer vacation started!”<br />
<br />
Peter looked up at him and then looked at Ashley, who had turned pale with fear. “So Ashley, who’s your friend?” Adam growled. “Look, just leave me and Peter alone!” Ashley returned, not wanting to look like a wimp in front of Peter. Adam grabbed Ashley by the collar and started to lift him from his seat, holding him a foot off the ground.<br />
<br />
“Hold it! Leave him alone!” Peter shouted at Adam, as he slowly got up. He slowly became filled with anger when he realized that these guys were completely taking advantage of Ashley.<br />
<br />
“Listen here, you fag! I’m going to collect my protection money from Ashley, and then I am going to offer my services to you, too!” Adam threatened Peter. Peter was losing patience with Adam and groaned. “Here we go again!”<br />
<br />
“You know what? I’m going to work on you first, Peter! You’re such a little fag, I’m going to officially welcome you to our school today… with my FIST!” Adam shouted, as he threw Ashley on the floor and walked towards Peter, clenching his fists together.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so” Peter said calmly.<br />
<br />
Adam decided to really scare Peter, and step on the seat at the table. Then he stepped on the table, slowly walking towards Peter. “I wouldn’t come any closer if I were you!” Peter said in a very calm voice. Ashley was astonished! Peter was completely fearless; he had no fear of the bullies at all! That seemed really strange to him! At first Ashley though that Peter might have a black belt in karate or something, but Peter had something much more powerful than that!<br />
<br />
Adam made one step closer to Peter, when he began to shrink rapidly, as he stood on the table. As his large head, chest, and arms dwindled, all that was left on the table was a red shirt and shorts and his shoes. A small ant crawled out from under the t-shirt! Ashley and all the other kids gasped in horror, as the big bully was reduce to a tiny, insignificant, and helpless little ant!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everyone froze in the cafeteria. You could hear a pin drop! All the other kids who sat at the table, and at all the other tables, had their mouths open out of astonishment.<br />
<br />
“Where did Adam go?” David and Keith snarled out loud, as they looked at Peter, standing on the other side of the long table. “We will both take care of you now, you fag!” Keith sneered, as both Keith and David stepped on the table, marching towards Peter. “We are coming to finish you off, little twerp!” David shouted at Peter.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah?” Peter answered calmly, as he kept his cool gaze at them.<br />
<br />
When David stood in front of Peter, he looked like he was about to jump on top of him! He leapt in the air, but only his clothes came back down, for David had instantly transformed into a fly! Peter commanded him to land on the table, standing next to Adam, who had now become an ant. When Keith saw what Peter had done to them, he became scared and was about to turn around and jump off the table.<br />
<br />
“Come back here, you rat! You’re such a coward!” Peter shouted. Immediately Keith had disappeared, leaving a small rat climbing out of a pile of clothes, on the cafeteria table.<br />
<br />
“Alright, anybody else?” Peter said calmly, looking over the cafeteria. “Anyone else wants to bother Ashley or me?”<br />
<br />
Ashley got up and stood next to Peter, with his jaw wide open.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright, Ashley?” Peter asked his new buddy.<br />
<br />
“Y… yeah… I… I’m alright… oh my God… H… How did you do that?” he stuttered, suddenly feeling a bit scared of Peter. He was very intimidated by the incredible display of power that he had just witnessed with his very own eyes!<br />
<br />
Peter gently rested his arm over Ashley’s shoulder. “Don’t be afraid, Ashley. You’re my friend, these Red Rangers won’t bother you anymore.” He said, while trying to comfort his friend. They looked at the table and laughed, when they saw the and, the fly, and the rat standing next to each other.<br />
<br />
“Now, Ashley, it is up to you to change them back. Just call their names out loud, okay?” Peter said, while casting a small spell on his new buddy.<br />
<br />
“Adam, come out!” Ashley said, and the and suddenly transformed into Adam, who was sitting naked on the table. Everybody laughed, for he had to get dressed! He grabbed his clothes, jumped off the table, and ran into the restroom.<br />
<br />
“Show me David!” Ashley shouted, and the fly turned into David, who was stark naked on the table. Again, all the kids in the cafeteria screamed and laughed at the site of the big bully, standing before them, completely helpless and naked.<br />
<br />
“Change back, Keith!” Ashley said out loud, and the rat instantly transformed back into Keith. He grabbed his clothes, jumped off the table, and ran, screaming at the top of his lungs while he was being followed by the laughter of everyone in the cafeteria.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, that was GREAT!” Ashley said, as he turned to Peter. “I want to be your best friend, okay?” he asked Peter politely.<br />
<br />
“Sure, that is no problem. Let’s finish our lunch so that we can go to our next class!” Peter said, with a grin on his face. He was happy to be with Ty, now he was going to the same school as him, and he had already made one new friend. <br />
<br />
Just at that moment Ty walked in. “I just saw the three Red Ranger guys… running down the hall, without their clothes on! My first thought was of you, Peter! Did you do that?” he asked. “Oh yes, they were picking on Ashley, and I helped him out. I can’t stand to see when my best friend in school gets picked on by a couple of bullies like that!’<br />
<br />
Ty and Peter realized that it was going to be fun and interesting school year, now that both of them were at the same school and in the same class!</p>
