<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark realized he could use Aidan for one of his fantasies, either the slow or the fast way. He quickly decided on the slow, more torturous way, thanks to having a sadistic streak in him.<br />
Aidan stood there frozen and silenced, fearing whatever Mark could do to him. That grin didn´t seem good for him, after all. And he was right.<br />
“Okay Aidan, I have decided what I will do with you. You can put your shirt back on first, and your hair will turn back to its original color. After that, all the clothes you own beside what you are wearing will merge into something resembling a really long bandage, which will wrap up your body from your toe up to your neck tightly.” Mark explained, still grinning wide.<br />
Aidan looked confused, not seeing what Mark would get out of this. He quickly put his discarded shirt back on while his hair turned back to its black color. Then, like a long chain of cloth, his clothes came flying from his bedroom, as well as his laundry basket in the bathroom. Everything circled around him, each part turning thinner and longer, merging at the ends, forming a long bandage, which then wrapped him tightly. If he could, he would have yelped as it bound his legs together tightly, but he remained standing. His still short cock was pressed tightly and painfully to his groin, making him moan inwardly. His arms were bound to his sides as tightly as the rest, leaving no room to even wiggle a finger, just like his toes. It also pressed the air out of his lungs, making his eyes go wide as he couldn´t breathe freely anymore. When his neck was wrapped, it got even worse, and he already saw black dots in his vision.<br />
Mark noticed Aidan´s panic and realized what was wrong quickly. “You won´t need to breath anymore, Aidan. You also won´t need to eat or drink for as long as you are wrapped up. And if you need to relieve yourself, your underwear will absorb everything, as if it was a diaper, even if it is just plain boxers.”<br />
Aidan could relax a bit as his need for air diminished, but he felt still rather uncomfortable with his tight bounds. He didn´t even register what else Mark had changed for him.<br />
Mark smiled when Aidan relaxed. He turned to the laptop, and typed something in. Aidan´s bag, which had been next to the table, shrunk into something resembling headphones. One of the books lying next to the laptop turned into a recorder including a tape inside. Next Mark stood again, and quickly stripped out of his own shoes, socks, jeans and underwear, just to put the jeans and shoes back on.<br />
Aidan´s eyes widened when Mark came to him with the underwear and socks in one, the headphones in his other hand. Mark placed the headphones on Aidan´s ears, blocking any sound out. Next, he pushed his own underwear over Aidan´s head, covering Aidan´s nose with the stench of his cock and balls. Aidan was even more horrified when Mark forced his mouth open, pushed his balled-up socks inside and closed it again, all the while grinning. Finally, he plugged the headphones into the recorder before pressing it onto Aidan´s wrapped groin. It quickly sunk in and vanished under the wraps, adding even more pressure on his cock and balls. The wire vanished along the bandages of his front, only visible the short part between his wrapped neck and the phones.<br />
Aidan couldn´t hear what Mark said next, sealing his fate. “Now that you are prepared, the wraps will also cover your head completely. Then you can enjoy my gifts to you even more.”<br />
Aidan, still with his eyes wide open, could do nothing as the tight wraps started to cover his head. Pressing the stinky underwear even firmer to his nose, sealing the rancid socks in his mouth, covering his hearing even more. A tear left Aidan´s wide eyes as they were wrapped as well, completely shutting Aidan from the world around him. <br />
Mark grinned at the mummy that was Aidan, standing straight were he had been wrapped up. He would enjoy the result later when Aidan´s conditioning was finished. Mark only used the laptop to make sure it would work on Aidan. Then he made sure nobody would go looking for Aidan, packed up the laptop and left the flat, leaving Aidan standing there.<br />
Aidan had no idea that Mark had left as he was unable to notice anything outside the wraps. He plead mentally for Mark to release him, with no effect.<br />
Over the next two weeks, Mark let Aidan stew in the wraps. Aidan had no need for any attention, and no needs that he would have to look after. <br />
To Aidan, it was hell. He had no way of knowing how long he was wrapped up, and was forced to stay awake by Mark, not that he needed sleep at the moment. The smell of Mark´s cock and balls from the underwear, together with the taste of his feet from the rancid socks, which both never got weaker, worked on his head. Together with the headphones, with most of the time buzzed in various frequencies, slowly reworked him. Mark had set it up to be completely random, just to make sure it would work with destroying Aidan´s mind. <br />
Over the time Aidan´s mind started to love the scent of Mark´s manhood, and the taste of his sweaty feet, or his sweaty body in general, so he started longing for being able to just suck on the real Mark, not just that lingering taste and smell in his face. He couldn´t think clearly anymore, as the buzzing broke his concentration more and more, leaving him more simple-minded.<br />
<br />
When after the two weeks Mark freed Aidan from the cocoon of bandages that had been his own clothes before, Aidan was conditioned to be loyal to Mark, in love even. Mark had shortly before let his old socks melt, which resulted in Aidan drinking the socks, further imprinting Mark´s sweaty scent into Aidan´s mind. He also let his underwear merge into Aidan´s skin, without any visible sign, but also intensifying the imprint on Aidan. The headphones were removed by Mark, along with the recorder, both turning back to what they had been before. There, in front of Mark, stood Aidan, looking just like he had two weeks ago.<br />
But now Aidan was his love-sick, loyal slave, and would be so forever, or at least as long as Mark didn´t change Aidan´s situation. And for now, he didn´t plan to.</p>
