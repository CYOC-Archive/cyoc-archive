<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up the next morning hoping it was all a dream, but my cum tasting breath confirmed me that I was forced 
to suck on my previous friends the day before. My room was dark when I woke up so I didn't knew what fate had 
Ty in store for me. 
<BR><BR>
Suddenly the lights came on and I soon discovered I wasn't in my room actually, but in a white room, and I had 
been sleeping in what appeared to be a hospital bed. If he was looking to frighten me this time, he got it. I 
check on myself dress only in a hospital gown, I looked like my old self, my original self, albeit less 
muscular, but at least I did looked like a sixteen years old. Never the less I knew this was probably the 
highlight of the day so I stepped out of the door.
<BR><BR>
"Subject D-02 is awoken." said a computer voice.
<BR><BR>
Dustin entered a white room that appeared to be empty. But as soon as he was in the middle a tube came from 
the ceiling and suck the gown away from him, leaving completely in the nude. Also revealing my member being 
considerably smaller than I remembered. At the same time a section of the walls opened revealing an 
observation deck fully staff with female observants. I immediately began to feel self-conscious as the voice 
began again.<BR><BR>
"Note how the subject is prone to massage his genitals at the slight possibility of a female interloper." the 
audience chuckle at the remark making me feel worse.<BR><BR>
With that a person, a doctor I believe entered the room. "Please welcome Dr. Zeller" said the voice, as the 
crowd began to applause.<BR><BR>The doctor began:"As you can see we recently acquire a new Stupid as a 
specimen donated by a local household. The family debated long on what to do, considering all the factors, 
they decided to donate it to our faculty so we could be able to understand this phenomena. At petition of the 
specimens donors a special video has to played to the whole class who will be working with him." The doctor 
made a gesture and the lights went down as a projection began:
<BR><BR>
It was Ty in his living room: "Good day to the investigators of the Stupid Hominid Syndrome. Let's call me 
Clark as my family wants to remain anonymous as you may now. My sibling Dustin today 16 years 104 days old was 
diagnosed with SHS early in life at four." The image change to that of a old home video of a naked Dustin as a 
five year old chasing some kids in what appeared to be his birthday party. "My family however decide that we 
could take on him, but by the age of 10 our patience was beginning to wane." Now was a picture of Dustin as a 
10 year old in a shit stain diaper and a T-shirt appeared on screen. "Today I said to you that my family could 
continue with such a burden, so we decided to donate Dustin so no family has to suffer what we did."
<BR><BR>
The film ended and now I had a better grasp of his situation, but at least I could try refute Ty's 
accusations... right?
<BR><BR>
The doctor began, "Well after seeing this video someone can tell me why SHS is described as a illness 
different to other congenital anomalies."
<BR><BR>One of the students grabbed a microphone and said: "Because the subject is not mentally disable as 
once was believed, since his neurological function are as that of any normal person."
<BR><BR>"Correct. Lets examine the physiology of a SHS subject." said the doctor. with that a set of metallic 
claws came and grabbed my wrists and ankles as to holding me in a spread position. The doctor grabbed a latex 
glove and started to caress my genitals. "One of the most defining elements of a SHS are they positively 
infantile size genitalia, notice that the penis is never over 2 inches long soft, an the testicles never drop, 
however the pubic hair does grow like that of a normal person. Now to better examine the genitalia we're going 
to dispose of it." <BR><BR>Another mechanical arm this time with a cup-like end attached to my crotch, as I 
felt a cold liquid pour inside, as time went by a washing motion began and the liquid began to burn. When I 
couldn't sustain it anymore another cool sensation spread through my groin and finally a sucking vacuum. When 
the arm de-attached itself, my crotch was bare of any hair, making my penis and ball look positively childish, 
and worse sporting my full 2 1/2 inches erection.<BR><BR>
"As you can see the erected form is not any better than the soft one. The instruments also indicate that 
during the depilatory process the subject indeed urinate himself. Another of the physical traits of the SHS." 
the crowd began to laugh at it. I was red of embarrassment at not only being displayed like that but also   by 
peeing without even noticing.<BR><BR>
"Good. Now can someone tell me another symptom of the SHS?"asked the doctor.
<BR><BR>
"Muteness." responded someone in the crowd.<BR><BR>"Correct. The subject vocal chords are otherwise healthy, 
but it will remain unable to talk." said the doctor. And suddenly it hit me. I wasn't gagged or anything, why 
was I unable to even try to defend myself.
<BR><BR>
"However this anomaly bring us to another topic. His psychology. The SHS although not considered retarded, 
have mostly bottom level IQ. Also they are used to indulge in the Id and are rarely potty trained or even 
clothed, thought there are cases they are the exception. Now to finish the lecture, what if we introduce the 
newest subject with our resident J-01-Alpha." said the doctor exit the room as the robotic arms let go of me, 
I wanted to crawl into a corner, never the less the room itself was circular, so there wasn't a way out.<BR>
<BR> Suddenly another door opened, and to my surprise it was my buddy Justin, as naked as I with longer hair 
that I remembered, but a decidedly smaller equipment than that I had to suck the day before,although it was 
still bigger than mine. However his muscular frame was the same, and soon I understand the Alpha remark on his 
subject number.<BR><BR> "The new subject finds our Alpha for the first time." said the voice of the doctor 
"The SHS have a very primitive way of social interaction, it resemble that of primates. There's an Alpha which 
is the leader and gets first dib on everything from food to mates, Betas who comes after and Gammas who can 
only get the leftovers of the group and rarely mate at all. Our new subject has to come to confront the 
current leader to determinate which group it is."<BR><BR>The next events proceeded as if I was compelled to 
say whatever the doctor was saying: "The new member of the group shall come closer to the actual leader, and 
stand as tall as he can, he would try to wrestle his way of dominance by submitting the other one and in an 
interesting choice try to penetrate the other with his phallus. If he succeeds the Alpha would be demoted, 
however as secondary characteristics often prove correct the less developed of the two shall end up losing and 
submitting to the other. As the Alpha finish sodomize his competitor, the loser has to show his respect for 
the Alpha by kissing and licking the tip of his penis. And from now on the loser has to present himself to the 
Alpha any time he wants relief from him."<BR><BR>
I was still with the still erect member of Justin in my tongue when the lights of the observation deck light 
up and the voice began once more. "Let's thanks Dr. Zeller one more time. Dr. Thank you for coming and 
bringing this two subjects to the SHS Awareness Day here at our High School..." I didn't need to hear more. 
The people who watch me all this time was no strangers, they were the people I knew from so long, my own 
friends and classmates, and at the tip of my eye I catch a glimpse of Ty with a big grin leaving the room.</p>
