<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she arrived at the campus grounds she felt Aeris calling for her to touch a student in their shoulder. Aeris had gained so much power already that once July picked out a random target and touched them the student behaviour suddenly changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there.&quot; The student greeted with Aeris&#39;s voice as she streched her arms. &quot;It&#39;s good that I can atleast make physical avatar to me. Sad that this lady had to sacrifice themselves for me, but who am I to judge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, sacrifice?&quot; July nervously asked.<br />
<br />
Aeris just nodded and explained to July that she was still inside her, but used this new woman who seemed to be on same year as July was necessary pawn for her to make July&#39;s job easier to steal more power for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was curious to know why all of the places you decided to come here. But now I see. There&#39;s a lot of potential futures here that was can just take to our liking.&quot; Aeris smiled and licked her lips as she glared at other students. &quot;Untapped potential might lead us to different paths with different inherited assests... hehehe...&quot;<br />
<br />
July wasn&#39;t sure what Aeris was talking about so instead decided to follow her body and attend the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Here&#39;s the rundown of the situation. Your body has now borrowing your mother&#39;s life and since they have something that you don&#39;t you can use it as your basis for the body you currently have. For laments terms your body is a fusion of all the living beings you&#39;ve stolen thus far making you a chimera of some sort. Now imagine if your mother&#39;s life was a string you added to your collection. You can set yourself to be at any point of her life and make your body follow that same path on auto pilot. And because you are somewhat powerless you have that urge to follow it, got it?&quot; Aeris explained as July was feeling more and more tranced to follow the silent instructions in her brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I advice you to steal an academic&#39;s life so you can act more like yourself, okay?&quot; Aeris tapped on July&#39;s back which let her off the weird hypnosis.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are saying that my body automaticly follow my mother&#39;s path?&quot; July asked as she found it hard to keep her head straight. &quot;How many people- I mean how many years I have to steal in order to become stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it!&quot; Aeris smiled. &quot;About 200 years should be enough for starters.&quot;<br />
<br />
July gritted her teeth and run past a growd of 50 student while gently tapping all of them to give their lives for her. All of the dissapeared and July started to feel more powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this what you wanted?&quot; July shouted to Aeris as she rose up from the ground.<br />
<br />
Aeris couldn&#39;t say anything as she was shocked how boldly she went and did that. Some men and women from her time would have hesitated to just take them for fear of degeneration and corruption, but this girl, she just went and did it. Aeris begun to smile as she knew that July was the best host she ever would imagine for.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what kind of power do I get next?&quot; July asked from Aeris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since I already talked about it. I will give you the small power to use other people untapped future as your own future. Meaning even if you steal someone&#39;s age and they never reached their adulthood. You could still use their genes to make a what if kind future where they still matured. Sadly it can only affect bodily changes like potential breast size or your voice, but you wouldn&#39;t gain any knowledge or status like what you had with your mother&#39;s completed future.&quot; Aeris explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I could just stick their best assets on my body and then make myself look different.&quot; July confirmed and tried to make her hair grow lengthier as she remembered one of the students having a hair reaching to their butt.<br />
<br />
She watched in awe as the hair magically got longer and longer until it resembled the hair what the student had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see. I wish one of them had just a little bit bustier future than my mother.&quot; July laughed and immediatly begun to push her mother&#39;s mature G-cups and felt something connecting. The G-cups begun to swell like balloons and because of the volume begun to droop down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess one&#39;s future was richer than my mother&#39;s&quot; July said as she hold on her swelling breasts and focused on the one student&#39;s future where they had become a K-cup. With the power July had she had made herself massive natural sagging tits that made themselves present even if you saw only July&#39;s back side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus. I look like an anime character with these.&quot; July noted while she bounced her meat sacks with her arms. &quot;They aren&#39;t that heavy, but feel a bit off. I should get myself bigger ass so I don&#39;t look so top heavy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She found out a student who was a little bit pudgy in the group and felt like if her body kept gaining eating the way she was she would gain atleast 290lbs of weight where most of it would had been in her ass and thighs. July begun to concentrate and took only the fatty ass part from her future.<br />
<br />
July ass popped like a popcorn in a microwave as the fat started to accumulate rapidly. The sudden weight gain ripped the jeans she had. July had to stop middle of the concentration as the ass had already beginning to get so big that her loose legging were tearing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I&#39;m not even half way throught and her ass is this large.&quot; July murmured as Aeris chuckled quietly at July&#39;s misfortune.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then again, that dumptruck you got there is pretty appealing and sexy.&quot; Aeris said with very sultry tone. &quot;Even a goddess such as myself couldn&#39;t resist the thing you are about to do, but maybe we should get you different clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With what money?&quot; July asked almost crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;With this.&quot; Aeris said and showed three 100 dollar bills on her hand. &quot;This girl has to be loaded with money. Her parents has to be merchants or even better, kings.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Aeris lead July out of the school campus. Two other students were witnessing all this quietly and glancing at the duo. They didn&#39;t feel scared more intriqued what she had done moments ago.</p>
