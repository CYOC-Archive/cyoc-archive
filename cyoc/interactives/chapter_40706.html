<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick stared at the Ricky doll as it became more real. There was something strange going on here. He decided to introduce himself hoping that would calm down whoever had been transformed into the Ricky doll. &quot;Hi&quot; he said and was surprised by how feminine his voice sounded. &quot;I know this may seem strange to you but my name is Rick. I don't know what exactly happened with me but I was going to see my girlfriend when I started to simply vanish. After being in whiteness for a few moments I found myself here in this doll's body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what happened to me though I was in the shower when it happened&quot; the Ricky doll said. &quot;You know, you have the same name as my boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you Alice!?&quot; Rick asked surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, either you have a girlfriend whose name is also Alice or you're my Rick&quot; Alice said. &quot;Is this a dream Rick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick thought about it and decided to test if it was. He concentrated on hovering but nothing happened. With a shake of his head he said &quot;This isn't a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened!?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
She seemed so distraught that Rick went over and hugged her. After a few moments he said &quot;I think we slipped into an alternate reality somehow. Perhaps if we look around we'll find the reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a good idea&quot; Alice said. &quot;There may be a problem though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have to pee&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this doll house seems to be real so I'm guessing there's a bathroom in it&quot; Rick said. &quot;Let's go find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They set off down the hall looking for the bathroom. They were surprised by how big the doll house was. It looked like there were several large bedrooms in it. It troubled them that there didn't appear to be a single bathroom in the place. Finally they found a bathroom behind the thirteenth door they tried. Alice looked at Rick and said &quot;Wait out here please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Alice shut the bathroom door and locked it. She may have been in a male body but she was still a girl inside and it wasn't appropriate for someone to see her pee. She went over to the toilet and pulled her pants down. She was surprised to see that she was wearing white briefs when she knew that the dolls didn't wear underwear. She shrugged her shoulders and sat on the toilet after pulling her underwear down. She supposed that she could of peed standing up since she had a dick now. Of course it was out of habit that she had sat down on the toilet to pee. It was definitely different peeing now.<br />
<br />
Out of habit Alice took some toilet paper and was about to wipe between her legs when she remembered that she peed from a different spot now. She carefully wiped the tip of her cock and that little action caused it to start getting stiff. She was afraid of what she would do if it continued so she pulled up her underwear and pants in a hurry. She was in such a hurry to get out of here that she almost forgot to flush the toilet. She was surprised that the toilet did work despite this being a doll house.<br />
<br />
Alice left the bathroom and asked &quot;Do you think we'll find something here to help us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's possible&quot; Rick said shrugging his shoulders. &quot;It's a place to start at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both set of exploring the house again. In a few moments they came across what appeared to be a library with an Angelina Ballerina plush pacing back and forth. They caught some of what she was saying. &quot;Why am I so driven to fix things!?&quot; she asked apparently not seeing them. &quot;What spell do I have to read!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there&quot; Rick said making Angelina jump. &quot;What were you saying about a spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Angelina couldn't understand why she wasn't able to fix things. She didn't even know what she was supposed to fix. All she knew was she had this deep desire to fix something and that book was the key.<br />
<br />
She began pacing asking &quot;Why am I so driven to fix things!? What spell do I have to read!?&quot; She kept asking this over and over hoping that the answer will come to her.<br />
<br />
Quite suddenly a feminine voice said &quot;Hi there&quot; making her jump. &quot;What were you saying about a spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angelina spun in the direction of the voice and saw that there was a teenage girl and boy standing there. &quot;Oh I need to find a spell in that book that will fix something&quot; Angelina said. &quot;I don't know what I'm supposed to fix though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I take a look at the book?&quot; the girl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead but I don't think you'll be able to make any sense out of it&quot; Angelina said. &quot;The spells are gibberish and what is in English is hard to understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl went over to the book and after a few seconds asked &quot;This is the spell you used?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angelina looked at the book and said &quot;That's the spell I read.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say it phonetically?&quot; the girl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes I did&quot; Angelina said a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have some good news and some bad news&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the good news Skipper?&quot; the boy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the good news is that I can read this&quot; Skipper said. &quot;Somehow I know that this is the ancient language of the gods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's the bad news?&quot; the boy asked. Angelina had a feeling that she didn't want to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bad news is this spell has to very different effects depending on how you say it&quot; Skipper said. &quot;If you pronounce it right it will reverse previous changes. If it's said phonetically it makes the previous changes semi-permanent plus pulls two people into dolls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Angelina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means that we're basically stuck like this&quot; Skipper said. &quot;We can change our bodies on a temporary basis but only for a short while. This will cause our memories of our original lives to slowly fade to dream like quality. I may be able to jump start those memories with this spell. Should i try it though?&quot;</p>
