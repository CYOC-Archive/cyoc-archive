<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the Turner family and their friends the events of the last hour were truely life changing. Lisa’s mother had sacrificed her own life to become the daughter Lisa always wanted. As Merlin explained this event was predetermined to occur, without it Lynne would never exist. Although thankful to have not lost her child, Lisa was having a great deal of difficulty wrapping her mind around her youngest daughter. Merlin thought it best that Tricia and Tommy come over to help Lynne in dealing with the situation<br />
<br />
“What,” Lynne groaned. Lisa just continued to stare at the young teen, still shocked that this girl had originally been her mother. “Mom,” she whined. “Can you please say something your really freaking me out.”<br />
<br />
“Freaking you out,” Lisa whispered. “In case you didn’t notice I just found out you were my mother befor you became my daughter. Do you have any idea how insane that is.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Lynne grumbled. “But still, it’s kinda rude to stare at someone like that.”<br />
<br />
“Now you really do sound like my mother.”<br />
<br />
Lynne folded her arms as she grumpily looked around the living room. Ever since witnessing Marilyn regressing into Lisa’s unborn child everyone was looking at her in the most peculiar way. Turning towards her friends she could see Tommy giving her a confused look while Tricia tried to stifle a laugh. “What are yu laughing about Tricia,” she frowned.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Lynne,” she giggled. “But this has to be said, How can you suck at history when you already lived through it.”<br />
<br />
Lynne frowned as her best friend burst into a fit of giggles. “So getting you back for that Trish.” Lynne now turned towards Tommy, she watched as the boy shrank back slightly causing the girl to wince. “Tommy,” she whimpered. “Don’t..don’t tell me you don’t like me anymore?”<br />
<br />
“What no,” Tomm said quickly. “It’s just...um...do I have to like fight your grandpa now. You were um his girlfriend first or something.”<br />
<br />
Lynne groaned in frustration as she rubbed her eyes. “No Tommy,” she sighed. “We’re fine and I’m pretty sure grandpa is too. Right grandpa?”<br />
<br />
Martin narrowed his eyes as he glared at Tommy. “You better treat her right young man.”<br />
<br />
“Okay this is nuts,” Katie exclaimed. “I’ve dealt with people getting younger, older, reality changing, other dimensions and all sorts of insanity but now your telling me my kid sister was actually my grandma?!? How the hell does this happen and why in the blue hell does she not remember.”<br />
<br />
“I can explain that,” Merlin said calmly. “You see, when Marilyn became Lisa’s daughter she erased her memories with the Ring of Age. The ring usually is able to preserve ones memories when they grow younger but it has its limits. If someone were to go back to pre-birth then their memories would be erased. That is until they came into possession of the ring once more.”<br />
<br />
Lynne’s eyes went wide as she listened to Merlin. “Oh my god,” she whispered. “Now it all makes sense.”<br />
<br />
“What makes sense,” Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
“Okay just here me out,” Lynne said. “When me and Tricia entered middle school Merlin decided that we were old enough to get magical items of our own. I thought for sure Gloria would give me the Ring and keep it in the family. Instead she gave it to Tricia. I was so mad I didn’t talk to Gloria for a week.”<br />
<br />
“It makes sense,” Merlin smiled. “You see even if Tricia let you borrow the ring you would not gain Marilyn’s memories. By Gloria giving you the ring, Lynne was able to retain her memories and preserve the secret.”<br />
<br />
“So we’re keeping this secret then,” Ann asked. Lisa stared dagger at her sister causing her to sister to shrink back. “Are you crazy I’m not telling Jason about this,” she screamed. “And that means everyone in this room is keeping this secret. You break that promise and I swear to god your going to end up this ones baby sister, do you understand!!!!”<br />
<br />
The others nodded quietly as Lisa angrily pointed at Lynne, she was obviously serious meaning that Ann,Stephanie, Jackie, Katie, Gloria, and Martin would keep the secret of Lynne’s origin. Satisfied Lisa sighed, sinking back into the couch. “Thank you,” she sighed before frowning. “Ugh Great She’s kicking.”<br />
<br />
“S..sorry mom,” Lynne stammered as she lowered her eyes.<br />
<br />
Lisa exhaled as she now approached Lynne. She hadn’t had a chance to talk with the girl since everything had happened. For her it felt odd, the girl had cost her her preganancy but had sacrificed herself in order for Lisa to have a child of her own. Thoughts of anger, love and sadness cross crossed her thoughts. Even if this child happened to have been her own mother at one point she needed to talk to her like a daughter. “Lynne,” she said softly. “Look...I..” she sighed in frustration as she looked at the sad teen. “Ugh you definitely remind me of my mother. Your just as hard headed but...you also have a big heart. I do love you, I really do. I’m going to take her advise. I forgive you for your actions and I want to thank you for everything .”<br />
<br />
“Thanks mom,” Lynne whispered. <br />
<br />
“Your welcome kid,” Lisa smiled. “You just gave me the best, most selfless Christmas gift anyone could ever give me. But when you finally do get home, you are so grounded.” Lynne frowned as Lisa chuckled softly. “Now go talk with your grandfather, I’m sure you two have a lot to talk about.”<br />
<br />
Lynne sighed as she now approached Martin, sheepishly she rubbed the back of her neck as she gazed at the elderly man. “Well now ai Know Why you moved closer to Lisa before I was born,” she mumbled. “And why we talk almost everyday. You really miss her...I mean me a lot.”<br />
<br />
Martin nodded sadly as he now gazed at Lynne. Gazing at the girl he could see a vestige of his wife in the teens face. “Lynne,” he croaked, “I’m always going to miss her. But, I promise from here on out I will always be there for you. Watching to make sure you grow up to be happy, healthy and loved by all who see you.”<br />
<br />
Lynne smiled as she now hugged her grandfather tightly. “I know for a fact you did grandpa, thank you.”<br />
<br />
“So what now,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
“Well Jason will be home in a few hours,” Lisa sighed, “I say we come up with a story about mom being sick and then go about our business like we were supposed to.”<br />
<br />
“I can help by providing an illusion of Marilyn,”Merlin stated. “If that would help?”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded in agreement as she now turned to her family. The holidays had barely begun and already things were weird, hopefully things would go much more smoothly for the rest of the holiday season.</p>
