<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a cooler head, I sent a message on Millie&#39;s cell phone apologizing for having lost my composure with her, only then did I realize that many people were looking at me as they passed. They mostly looked at my tail and it embarrassed me, I had to do something about it fast.<br />
<br />
The first thing I thought about doing was going back to the cafeteria behind Millie, but I didn&#39;t find her there. I had no idea where she could have gone or if she had actually gone somewhere else, remembering that she could hide her presence with her powers. I searched the mall for her with no success, so I left and as I walked through the parking lot I was stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop there demon, you&#39;re not going to take any victims here if I can help it.&quot; I heard a woman&#39;s voice telling me.<br />
<br />
I looked in the direction of the voice and came across a girl about my age, she was a blonde with blue eyes, she wore a simple white dress, even so you could see that not only her face but her entire body were extremely beautiful. She was approaching me walking, meanwhile she was holding a golden bow and arrow pointed at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, I&#39;m no demon.&quot; I said to the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m stupid. Did you think no one would notice if you showed your tail like this? And it&#39;s no use trying to convince me it&#39;s a toy, I recognize a real demon tail when I see one.&quot; the girl said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already said that I&#39;m not a demon, at least I&#39;m not yet.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;You say you&#39;re not a demen yet? You mean you&#39;re becoming a demon?&quot; the girl asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the transformation started a few hours ago and so far I only have the tail. But I don&#39;t want to become a demon, I want to find a way to stop my transformation.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you want to transform even after all you&#39;ve done to become a demon?&quot; the girl asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything, I didn&#39;t even know it was possible for someone to become a demon and I still don&#39;t know why that happened.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not lie to me. A person becomes a demon if a demon itself injects a demon seed into them. The tail is just a first sign, but if you already know what is happening to you it is because you already know the demon responsible and you are very close. If you didn&#39;t know of this demon&#39;s existence, he would have erased your memory so you couldn&#39;t remember the moment you first came into contact and he injected his demon seed into you.&quot; the girl said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, the only demon I know of is my friend Millie, but she was also a normal girl and started transforming just over two days ago, finishing her change just now.  I actually started transforming within minutes of her transformation finished. We split up after arguing as she wants me to become a demon and I don&#39;t want to become one.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;Is what you say seriously? And this friend of yours, did she know what was happening to her in the beginning?&quot; the girls asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She did not know. She came to me showing that she had a tail and saying that she liked it and that&#39;s why she would keep it, but I had no idea she would change even more.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand the situation.&quot; The girl said, and paused, she lowered her arms and arch and arrow disappeared, at the same time huge wings covered in white feathers grew up on her back and a bright halo appeared above her head &quot;My name is Clara and as you can see I am an angel, so it is my obligation to help you in this situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After my best friend turns into a demon and I start to become one do I meet an angel? Though it might be exactly what I need. So what do I need to do to stop my transformation?&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;You are changing because of the demonic seed within you, so you need a heavenly seed to counter that. But I&#39;m already warning you that this is no guarantee that it will work, because the two forces will face each other inside you and as long as you don&#39;t win you will continue to be a normal human, but that will depend on your willpower so that you don&#39;t feed either of the two seeds.&quot; Clara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it not for any of the seeds to win? I understand that if the demon seed wins I will become a demon, but what will happen if the celestial seed wins?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you will become an angel just like me.&quot; Clara said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s risky but it&#39;s better than nothing. How do I get this heavenly seed?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I have them in my body, they are produced right here.&quot; Clara said, lifting her dress and showing a relatively large cock and balls between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I thought you were a girl.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, many say that angels don&#39;t have a defined sex but it&#39;s the opposite, to make it easier for us to understand we are all male and female at the same time, only the body in general that has a feminine or masculine appearance. The heavenly seeds are produced and stored in my balls and can come out along with my cum when I come if I want to.&quot; Clara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying I need to have sex with you to have the seed?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not necessary, but it&#39;s more effective that way.&quot; Clara said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it. Where and when do you think we can do this?&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;The sooner it&#39;s done the better, so if you&#39;re willing we can do it now.&quot; Clara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I can&#39;t wait.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;So let&#39;s go.&quot; Clara said and flew towards me, grabbing me and taking with her.<br />
<br />
We had quickly pulled out of the mall parking lot and were soaring through the sky, going higher and higher until we reached the clouds. When we were high enough she let go of me and I fell a few feet, coming to rest on a cloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, no one will disturb us.&quot; Clara said and her dress disappeared. She then stroked her cock a little, making it hard.<br />
<br />
My shirt was suddenly stretched out from behind and ripped, it was my wings that had grown. &quot;Quick, we&#39;re running out of time.&quot; I said, quickly taking off my clothes which, unlike me, plummeted through the cloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready, let&#39;s go.&quot; Clara said, reaching down and penetrating her hard tool in my pussy.<br />
<br />
Even letting Clara fuck me for better results in keeping me from turning into a demon, I was loving the way I felt. I was literally on the clouds and getting fucked by an angel, so I couldn&#39;t hold back and came. Instinctively I hugged her, and forgetting the initial reason I was having sex with her I just wanted her to make me come more. When I reached my second orgasm Clara still didn&#39;t seem to be close to coming, but she said it was good that I was enjoying it as that would be a big help.<br />
<br />
It took a while but Clara finally came, it was something really divine to feel the sacred cum entering my womb, it led me to reach another orgasm, the most intense I had ever had. I looked down at my belly and saw it inflate a little from the amount of cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavenly seed successfully implanted.&quot; Clara said when her orgasm ended. She then brought her face closer to mine, still with her cock inside me, and said &quot;In a few minutes you should be back to normal, but remember that the fight will still go on inside you for a few weeks so any relapse can tip you either way. And preferably have no doubts, as this can bring unexpected results for you. And I also recommend that you cut ties with her friend, if she has already completed her transformation into a demon then there is no turning back for her and she can have a negative influence.&quot;<br />
<br />
I then questioned Clara about the real need to cut ties with Millie as she took her dick out of me and stood up, and she insisted that the next time I saw my best friend I should say goodbye to her. I still had more questions, but she said that she had already done what she could for me and that she would need to leave for a new mission, saying goodbye to me.<br />
<br />
When saying goodbye, Clara&#39;s dress reappeared on her body and she flew away, soon after the cloud stopped supporting my weight and I started to fall. I got scared and taking advantage of the wings I tried to fly, but I realized that I didn&#39;t know how to fly and the most it did was reduce the speed of the fall a little, but not for long, for soon my wings shrank and disappeared in my body. I didn&#39;t see any alternative, I was falling naked from the sky and I was going to smack myself to the ground, and I still had time to feel my tail disappear too.<br />
<br />
I had already returned to normal and I tried to see if I could deviate from the direction I was going and fall on something that could cushion the impact, but when I saw the direction I was going I realized that I could see the apparatus that I shared with the Mille and the bedroom window was open. At this point I could do nothing but accept fate, but then I saw that I was heading towards my bedroom window and, as I approached, my fall slowed and I went inside, falling on my bed with enough impact to just shake it a little.<br />
<br />
Safely, I sat on my bed and reflected on what Clara had said to me, with that I thought about how I would say goodbye to Millie, but this proved to be something much more difficult for me than I expected. I realized that this would be difficult for me and I feared the end of my friendship more than losing my humanity. I started to wonder then if it wouldn&#39;t have been better for me to have simply accepted my transformation into a demon, just as I thought if I became an angel maybe I could help her and Millie in some way.<br />
<br />
It got dark and there was no signal for Millie to get home and I started to get worried but I was exhausted after a tiring day and I ended up falling asleep.</p>
