<br />
(Daracha&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Great&#39;&#39; thought Daracha. Another day at that stupid festival, with her stupid costume, and her stupid minimum wage, and her stupid boss.<br />
<br />
She entered the changing room and grabbed her costume. It was a huge pink dress that she thought was too glamorous for her to wear. Daracha got changed and went in front of the stage mirror to braid her hair. Her hazelnut brown hair felt soft in her hands.  <br />
<br />
She finished, then made her way to the stage. Daracha forced a fake smile and entered the scene just in time, as she always did.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Welcome, people of all ages! To the 25th London Medieval Festival! Meethinks you&#39;re all here to have some fun?&#39;&#39; she yelled out.<br />
<br />
The crowd watching had huge smiles on their faces, and they all laughed and clapped as she acted. When her part was over, Daracha returned to the changing room, having gotten a few &#39;&#39;congratualtions&#39;&#39; for her quote on quote, great acting. <br />
<br />
It was the same thing every year. Every year for two months (you heard me, two months), London would hold this stupid medieval themed festival that mostly focused on pleasing children and cheap attractions. Since Daracha was rather poor, acting as the festival&#39;s &#39;&#39;princess&#39;&#39; was the only way to make her some decent cash.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
(Jacob&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
Apparently, Catrina really wanted to see the Medieval Festival a few blocks away. I didn&#39;t know why, and I didn&#39;t ask. I&#39;d accepted that whatever she wanted to do, we&#39;d do it. Besides, I had heard that my good friend Daracha would be acting there, so who was I to complain?<br />
<br />
We took my car out to the festival. Let me tell you, it didn&#39;t get any more bright and colorful than that. Catrina, who was dressed to conceal her cat features, gave a squeal of excitement.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Oh, I used to love going to this festival as kid! It hasn&#39;t changed a bit!&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
And with that comment, we tried our luck at some of the attractions. There was the apple dunk, the rubber duck race, and a lot more than I cared to count. We explored the festival until it got dark. Thankfully, the lights brightened up the place, and there was still no shortage of people showing up.<br />
<br />
Eventually we wandered into a large tent with rows of seats that were almost all occupied. Catrina and I sat down, only to see my friend Daracha on the stage, giving some sort of act. She was wearing a princess&#39; costume, with a pink dress and that funny hat that&#39;s shaped like a cone.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
(Daracha&#39;s point of view)<br />
<br />
And so I finished my last act of the day (thank God for that). I was walking back when I heard a familiar voice call me.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Hey, Daracha! Long time no see!&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
I turned around to see my old friend Jacob and some girl heading in my direction. A smile instantly spread across my face, and I gave him a hug. Since I was a very tall woman, his head reached my breasts.<br />
<br />
We started catching up, but I couldn&#39;t help but stay focused on the girl with blue hair. Was she Jacob&#39;s girlfriend? She certainly seemed fond of him... <br />
<br />
My thoughts were interrupted by a strange sensation coming from my head... it was like some strange headache. Talking to Jacob became more difficult by the second. I finally told him that I wasn&#39;t feeling too well, and that I had to leave. Jacob understood, and he handed me his phone number on a slip of paper. <br />
<br />
I headed for the changing room, since I was pretty sure they had medicine there. When I entered, nobody was there. It was sort of creepy at night. I checked the medicine cabinet behind the mirror, but of course they didn&#39;t have any for headaches.<br />
<br />
Suddenly when I was in front of the mirror, I noticed something strange. Was it just me, or was my ass a tad bigger than it was before? I chose to ignore it, so I decided it would be a good time to lay down on the changing room&#39;s couch, since I felt like utter shit.<br />
<br />
I sneezed, and a puff of smoke came out of my mouth. That&#39;s when I knew something was very wrong. <br />
<br />
I felt a tugging sensation coming from my rear, so I took off my ridiculous princess costume to check, leaving me in my bra and panties. I screamed when I&#39;d seen it. I had grown a long, green, reptilian tail. I started to panic, but the changes kept coming. My nails replaced themselves with claws. Patches of slick green scales appeared all over my body.<br />
<br />
My initial feeling of panic was replaced with incredible horniness. I went down to my knees and moaned as my ass grew to twice its&#39; normal size. My panties were stretched to their absolute limit, and they finally snapped. <br />
<br />
I felt two small horns emerging from my head. While I should&#39;ve felt massive pain, there was none. My face stretched out until it was the shape of a reptile&#39;s muzzle -- I knew I was transforming into a dragon. This was confirmed as two great wings sprouted from my back.<br />
<br />
My change was complete. Unable to stand from my quivering body, all I could do was pant on the floor. After a while, I mustered enough energy to get up and check the mirror. <br />
<br />
I had gotten taller -- much taller, I stood at around 7&#39;1, and my shiny red wings towered the room. My skin had mostly been replaced with green scales, but it was regular human skin from the waist down. It was almost as if I was covered in armor. My face was slightly similar to that of a dragon, but I had retained all of my long, brown hair. My average sized breasts were plated with scales, and my nipples had changed to a dark green color. I turned around to find my ass had expanded quite a lot, far past bubble butt. <br />
<br />
I had to find a way to hide myself, no matter the cost. People with the A-Virus were not treated well, I had once heard. Since my old clothes hadn&#39;t fit me, I had no choice but to walk around in the nude. What was difficult was trying to sneak past a whole festival of people. It took some doing, but I had managed to escape into the nearby woods. <br />
<br />
I decided, with tears in my eyes, that it would be best if I stayed there for now. But fate had other plans. In the shadows emerged a woman in some sort of military uniform -- weird stuff. <br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Hello, Daracha. My name&#39;s Sarah Rogers.&#39;&#39;<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t seem fazed by the fact that I was basically half dragon, but I kept myself silent.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;I take care of the various people inflicted by the A-Virus, such as yourself&#39;&#39; she said calmly. &#39;&#39;I&#39;m going to need you to come with me&#39;&#39;.</p>
