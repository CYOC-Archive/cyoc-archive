<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hey y&#39;all! So, I just wanted to let all the readers know that after this point, loads of more options will coming. I just wanted to lay the groundwork for the story. And feel free to add some yourself! Enjoy!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“That’s not all you can do.” Robin started. Then he waved over to the waitress. She was in her mid-forties with short, brown hair and hazel eyes. She wore a ton of makeup to cover her wrinkly face and had bags under her eyes from lack of sleep. <br />
<br />
“Yes?” She said, then her eyes opened wide looking at Robin, then closed and returned to normal. <br />
<br />
“Sit down dear, join the party.” Robin said. Without objection, the waitress sat down next to Julia. Robin looked at her, and tilted his head, moving his fingers through the air. Almost instantaneously, the woman started to get younger; her hair grew longer, and the makeup disappeared from her face, which was losing it wrinkles rapidly. Her body weight decreased and her breasts started to get perky. Her clothes changed from the light blue waitress dress into a blue tank top a denim shorts. Before long, the woman who was once a middle-aged waitress, was a young teenage beauty. <br />
<br />
“I know how much trouble you’ve had getting a girlfriend Julia, so here you are.” Robin said. Then the girl looked over at Julia and smiled. She leaned over and grabbed Julia, planting a long, passionate kiss on her lips. Julia gorged in the lusciousness of her lips and her soft breasts pressing up against her. They kissed long and hard before she backed off to take a breath. She glanced at the girl, admiring her beauty. <br />
<br />
“Plus, if you don’t like the way she looks, you can always change her, like such.” The girl started to change again; her hair became lighter in color, changing to blonde. “Or perhaps you’d want to try something a bit more exotic?” The girl then started morphing again, as her skin darkened to a rich caramel color as her hair and eye color changed to a dark brown, leaving her a gorgeous Latina girl. <br />
<br />
“Maybe you’d like to experience one of the true features of being a woman?” Robin said. Then, the girl morphed once more, as her skin and hair lightened, acquiring features much like Julia’s. Then she started to regress in age, as Julia progressed simultaneously; in a matter of seconds, Julia became a curvaceous woman in her thirties, with huge breasts which seemed to be lactating. Then she glanced at the girl, who was now a toddler, staring at Julia’s breasts. Instinctively and without control, she unbuttoned her blouse and pulled off her bra, revealing her massive mammaries. She pickup up the toddler and placed her mouth on her left breast, and she started to suckle, sending pleasure through Julia at the same time. She gained control of her body again, but continued holding the toddler on her breast, basking in how good it actually felt. <br />
<br />
“There’s more as well.” Robin said, waiting for Julia to finish feeding her child. When the girl was finished, she burped slightly as Julia placed her down next to her, covering her breasts. “Maybe you don’t like it in Moonlight Bay anymore, or just want to try living in a new place? That can be arranged…” And as he said this, Julia blinked, and found herself in the Southern United States, sitting in a bar as a busty blonde girl with tattoos across her body. <br />
<br />
“Dang, hold you horses!” Julia said, surprised with her new Southern accent. “Why am I some trailer trash bitch now?” <br />
<br />
“Well, figured it’d be a good fitting for the location. We can try something else though…” She blinked again and now was in Paris at a café near the Eiffel Tower. <br />
<br />
“Mon Dieu!” Julia said, looking at her reflection in the café window, seeing she was now a hot, skinny, dark-haired French girl. Another blink, and another location, now somewhere in Africa, as she jumped back at her ebony skin and hefty breasts. She blinked again, now in Hong Kong as a young, fit Asian girl with long black hair. Finally, she blinked once more, and found herself as the mother she was before, now back in the diner. <br />
<br />
“Whoa…” She said, amazed at that trip around the world as a few different people. <br />
<br />
“Told ya’.” Robin said, sipping his coffee.<br />
<br />
“But… I still don’t understand.” Julia asked. “You created this power to murder a military general. That doesn’t sound like something you would have just to change one’s own life.”<br />
<br />
“The truth is Julia, it’s not really designed specifically for anything. It’s an all-powerful grip on life. Whether you want to use it to change around your own life, the lives of others, or to experience new things, you can do it all. However, as I mentioned before, having the power to do nearly anything you want, comes tremendous responsibility.” He leaned forward to get closer to Julia. “You have to give me your word,” He whispered sternly, trying to get the point across. “I don’t mean to sound all high and mighty, but I chose YOU, and bestowed this power to YOU. Don’t make the mistake of those before you. Only use this power for your own good, don’t meddle with the major events of the world, for it will only cause chaos and destruction.” Julia didn’t know what had happened in the past for him to adopt this rule, so to say. But she knew that there was a major risk if she didn’t follow what he was telling her.<br />
<br />
“I don’t plan on using this for anything other than my own life. It was already messed up so much that I couldn’t care less what else was going on.” She said. “I give you my word. I won’t meddle with world events. And God forbid I do, I’ll gladly hand the power right back to you.” Robin smiled and leaned back. <br />
<br />
“I knew my faith was well-placed in you.” He said, finishing his coffee and standing up. By the way, it’s smart to keep the mobile device on you, but it’ll find its way to you if you don’t. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean-” Julia asked, reaching in her pocket, surprised to find the small smart phone-looking device. <br />
<br />
“You’ll have all the features on it that you do on the computer version. And don’t worry about someone else finding it and using it against you, it’s set only so you can use it.” He placed a few bills on the table as Julia felt herself changing. She turned back to her original female self, and the waitress had turned into the young girl Robin had first turned her into. “Anyway, I must be going now, I’ll leave you and your new girlfriend here to your own business. If you need any help or advice with the device… hmm, that rhymes,” He chuckled. “There’s an option to call me on there. Enjoy yourself!” He said, walking out of the diner whistling.</p>
