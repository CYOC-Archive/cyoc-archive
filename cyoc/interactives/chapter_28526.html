<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julio and Janice saw each other as they entered the 'tunnel' hallway that lead <br />
to the common room of the recruits. Julio was back in his traveling clothes and <br />
Janice/Tabra was still in her simplistic dress. &quot;You look more alive when I last <br />
saw you.&quot; Julio said simply, back in his human form looking and feeling more <br />
recharged than he had since setting foot in that desert above them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Same to you.&quot; The angel fox nodded. <br />
<br />
Julio noted the grace in their steps. He wondered what had happened. His <br />
brain was suddenly filled with mental images of masturbation and quickly set <br />
them on fire and threw away the ashes. 'Well, there was no way that was it.' <br />
Julio told himself. No matter what it was though, Julio could tell that the angel <br />
fox besides him was indeed more at peace with herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose I'm speaking to one entity now.&quot; Julio shot in the dark. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry no, there's still two of us in here.&quot; She said in a formal well paced tone <br />
of voice that Julio had come to recognize as Tabra's. <br />
<br />
&quot;I take it the war is over?&quot; Julio asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are just some things I realized.&quot; The angel fox said in another tone, this <br />
one less refined than the first and easier flowing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Private.&quot; She said in a firm tone. <br />
<br />
Julio accepted that, he was going to have enough on his mind as it was. <br />
<br />
None of the three were prepared for what they saw when they entered the <br />
common room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not again.&quot; Julio pleaded covering his eyes. <br />
<br />
The angel fox looked at him with a look that almost implied pity. &quot;Will you stop <br />
being a whiner and enjoy the view.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy for you to say.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There is no such thing as 'boy you' and 'girl you' you can stop making a fuss <br />
over it.&quot; Though Julio -knew- it had to be Tabra who said that, there was none <br />
of his normal 'hammer it into place' motif behind the words. <br />
<br />
Of course, the fact the four recruits were in nothing but their fur again was <br />
hardly what was fantastic about the scene. <br />
<br />
The four recruits were in a semi-circle, some on their stomachs, another sitting <br />
up with her knees on her chest, and another just laying in a pose of a <br />
sculpture one hand on a knee another on the sandy floor. Their wings were <br />
arched rather than just laying against their bodies. Their tails slowly swayed <br />
back and forth, making patterns in the sand around them. <br />
<br />
None of them was odd, it was what they were -doing- that was the heart <br />
stopper! They were -chatting-. Like a couple of ladies, or teenage girls, talking <br />
much about nothing. <br />
Everyone had a slight smile on their faces with emotionally lit up eyes. They <br />
would have looked right at home at a slumber party. <br />
<br />
And they hadn't looked more alive since Karther had kidnapped and <br />
brainwashed each of them. <br />
<br />
The senior angel fox put one hand to her face and actually made a small <br />
chuckle. 'They've adapted to the gender change at least.' Tabra thought. <br />
<br />
'Tabra, it's funny, I feel like sitting down and joining them.' <br />
<br />
'Nothing to be ashamed of Janice, nothing at all.' <br />
<br />
Julio clapped his hands, &quot;Okay boys! Break time's over! Clothes back on! <br />
Stand up straight! Front and center!&quot; <br />
<br />
The four newbie angels all started and broke up their discussions and in a <br />
hurry summoned the loose fitting sparring clothes they had been wearing <br />
before, then having to make some very quick adjustment a couple having <br />
forgotten about their tail and wings, creating a slightly comical sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to berate you this one time.&quot; Said the senior fox's calm voice. <br />
&quot;Because I know very much that this was something every last one of you -<br />
needed-.&quot; The fox's voice changed tones for a moment. &quot;Like I needed.&quot; Then <br />
continued. &quot;But add this to your list of things to remember, for what we're <br />
going to be doing, and where we're going back to, keeping your wits about is <br />
a must.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this even get started?&quot; Julio asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; Viki scratched the side of head. &quot;I figured it was best that since we're all <br />
sisters, it was only right we knew more about each other from -before- Karther <br />
turned us into his slaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa picked up, &quot;So she asked me what I did for a living before Karther <br />
kidnapped me. She said it was only fair since we all knew what Viki did for a <br />
living. I realized she was right so I began talking, only I realized how easy it <br />
was for me to just keep going, and how Viki was willing to listen to <br />
everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After that.&quot; Viki said, &quot;With me and Lisa having shared, we thought that Erica <br />
and Luna should too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want to at first.&quot; Erica carried on. &quot;I really wanted those things to <br />
remain private, I mean, we all used to be -guys-, -human- guys! I was worried <br />
that it might just screw with our heads to know that sort of stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wanted to for us to practice more while waiting for you and Janice.&quot; <br />
Luna said. <br />
<br />
Viki smiled, &quot;But we got them to crack eventually, Erica broke first. We only <br />
had to ask her five times, and violate her breathing space from two different <br />
locations!&quot; Viki laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;After that.&quot; Erica continued. &quot;I didn't see what the big deal was before. I mean, <br />
we're -all- in the same boat here. We all want the same thing. We all made the <br />
same choice to stay. We -should- get to know each other better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I felt like I was in invasion of the body snatchers.&quot; Luna explained, &quot;I mean, <br />
Erica -wanted- to spare with me! Then Viki and Lisa had to go and steal my <br />
sparring partner.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Finding herself surrounded on all sides.&quot; Viki added, &quot;Luna finally began to <br />
crack, it wasn't until we started to make good on our threat of tickle torture that <br />
she finally caved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still say that was cheating.&quot; Luna returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;All's fair in love and war.&quot; Viki quoted. <br />
<br />
&quot;After that,&quot; Erica jumped in, &quot;We moved onto topics that we were all <br />
interested in, it was kinda nice actually, to actually -do- something that wasn't <br />
about sex, life or death.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean supposed?&quot; Erica looked at Luna. &quot;Admit it, you were <br />
having as much fun as us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You shall never get me to say that.&quot; Luna said in a matter of fact tone. <br />
<br />
The three other newly born angels looked at each other and began to make <br />
ready to begin another tickle torture session on poor Luna. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Tabra broke in. &quot;That's enough! I think we all get the idea now. Now <br />
let's get back to teaching you the trick of trade to keep yourselves from getting <br />
killed or blowing yourselves up. But before we begin. I'm going to go over <br />
some final reminders and disclaimers. I don't want any of you saying I didn't <br />
warn you. Then, Julio and I are going to show you what 'boot camp' actually <br />
means! You're going to learn these things in time to fight Tamthis and <br />
Karther's force even if it kills you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Luna said in a polite voice raising her hand. &quot;Before we do that. <br />
Can I make one -quick- run at getting a hit on Julio?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bet's already over.&quot; Julio pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I just want to try.&quot; Luna said in a strangely polite voice that screamed <br />
she was up to something. <br />
<br />
The three other lesser angels took a step back from her. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right fine. But you get -one- shot. Then we move on, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Works for me.&quot; Luna said in a voice that said she didn't plan on losing. <br />
<br />
Julio got in a fighting stance, ready for whatever attack Luna thought of. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You want unorthodox right?&quot; In a flash she willed her cloth garment back into <br />
the proto-matter it was made from, showing herself off to the world. This <br />
completely startled Julio for two whole seconds and received a solid kick in <br />
the gut and ended up leaning over.<br />
<br />
Every single other female jaw in the place dropped and hit the floor. If all of <br />
them, Luna had been the last the other thought would resort to that tactic. <br />
<br />
 &quot;And I could have aimed lower, believe me I've had the fantasy of doing it to <br />
the prince bastard ever since we got here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You DO realize,&quot; Julio said in the most fantastically calm voice ever, &quot;There's <br />
no way that trick would work on the monsters or the real pervert and insane <br />
fox queen? And that's there no way that trick would catch me off guard twice?&quot; <br />
'I am so going to get her for that.' Julio thought. <br />
<br />
Tabra said nothing, not wanting to say he had put that move in reserve in <br />
case Julio turned on them. <br />
<br />
'Oh no you didn't!'<br />
<br />
'Oh yes I did. If it works, it work! Besides, I heard you thinking of whacking our <br />
head against a wall until I fell unconscious next time you wanted to be alone <br />
when we first got here.' <br />
<br />
'Granted.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe, &quot; Luna amazingly conceded to the point. &quot;But I did something <br />
that worked for the situation didn't I?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe.&quot; Julio said, at least she was trying to be creative. Luna <br />
recreated her attire before Julio could order her to put it back on. <br />
<br />
'They should be glade Mike isn't their instructor.' Tabra thought, 'he always <br />
means well, but he INVENTED the hard knocks method, and clowns have the <br />
jokes squeezed out of them fast.' <br />
<br />
'Does it work?'<br />
<br />
'I'm still alive aren't I?'  &quot;All right, now that we have the carnival side show out <br />
of the way. Let's begin.&quot; 'Janice, you take notes too.' <br />
<br />
'Right.'<br />
<br />
   Tabra cleared her voice and spoke, &quot;Remember the key about this power is <br />
this... restraint.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Restraint?&quot; Luna asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are now something surrounded by a mortal shell that isn't technically <br />
supposed to be on this plane of reality. It is -very- easy to do collateral <br />
damage with this power, so remember, you must exercise restraint.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if we don't?&quot; Viki asked, wondering about the worst case scenario. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hiroshima.&quot; The senior fox angel said calmly. &quot;And you'd be in very deep <br />
sewage when you met the rest of OUR race.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You have GOT to be kidding!&quot; Erica said, &quot;There's no way we're -that- <br />
powerful! Or you're -that- powerful! You could have taken down Karther when <br />
you first showed up easy peesy!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa eyed her sisters with her pools of blood before speaking, &quot;It does kind of <br />
seem a lot like those cheesy Kung-Fu cartoons where all the heroes can blow <br />
up a planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's where the 'restraint' part comes in. And when I say Hiroshima. I mean <br />
you, at the blast center, in the role of Fat Man and Little Boy. Only there's likely <br />
to be less of you after the blast.&quot; <br />
<br />
Erica's eyes were wide. &quot;Now I -know- you're kidding!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish. You are right, you aren't that powerful, -yet-! You don't have that kind <br />
of power. -Yet-! But you will! And you need to start practicing control while you <br />
still have a huge margin for error on stupid newbie mistakes. I opened up my <br />
real wings for only a split second, and well, you weren't there to witness it, but <br />
I'm sure you felt the castle shake. Oh, and about those heroes who can blow <br />
up a planet? You could possibly do that, if your wings were fully matured. <br />
Fully charged. Had about a century worth of experience. And you were full of <br />
reckless abandon. You could do that -easily-, but you'd also totally destroy <br />
your mortal body in the process, there wouldn't even be -atoms- of it left. And <br />
you could possibly damage reality too. And plus, when you end up at the <br />
gates, you'll go there automatically, those who charge will not be very happy <br />
with you at all, and you don't want them to be unhappy with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Viki summed it up. &quot;Remember we're constantly in a urban environment with <br />
bazookas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra let it sink in the rest of the recruits before continuing, <br />
<br />
&quot;Moving on. They'll be infinite and diversity and power, brains and skill. But <br />
there are three base types of opponents you'll run into on the mortal plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grass, Fire, and water?&quot; Erica suggested, thinking of her nephew's pokemon <br />
game. <br />
<br />
Tabra shook her head. &quot;Living, Construct, and Spirit. Living, as in a human <br />
being, dragon, whale, house plant, they can be taken down with spiritual and <br />
material attacks, but often the smartest and most rounded. Constructs: <br />
machines, golems, zombies, they don't have a soul, are not self aware, aren't <br />
alive, and most never were alive. They're normally mindless, but sentient <br />
ones do exist. Whose lack of a existence after this one makes them reckless <br />
or extremely careful. Spiritual attacks don't work on them -at all- unless they're <br />
animated by magic. So stick to physical attacks. Finally, Spirit, you can guess <br />
this one. Spirits without bodies, or magic given an animated form without a <br />
material container. Material attacks can NOT hurt them, but some can cheat <br />
and use material attacks anyway, use spiritual attacks, and remember they <br />
are NOT restrained by such pesky things like gravity, and solid objects like <br />
you are inside a living body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa pepped up. &quot;Still a little funny to think of my body as separate from me, <br />
just a shell. But at the same time... it just feels normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You get used to it.&quot; Tabra promised honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me asking the obvious question,&quot; Luna did, &quot;But what ARE spiritual <br />
and psychical attacks?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't that obvious then?&quot; Erica said with a smile on her face. &quot;It's like in an <br />
RPG! Magic attacks and sword and club attacks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Tabra said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Erica blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I said 'no' as in your are incorrect. A sword or club you summon could be a <br />
spiritual attack, and magic could be a material one. It isn't the source of the <br />
attack itself that matters. It's WHAT it effects! If it effects the material universe, <br />
it's a material technique, if it effects the spiritual world that exists over the <br />
material one, then it's spiritual. If I, just for example, had my sword cut through <br />
your arm, then you could possibly heal it over and eventually regenerate it. If <br />
my sword cut through the part of your SOUL in your arm... your arm would die, <br />
instantly, and so would any arm you attempted to regenerate onto your <br />
shoulder, even a replacement limb wouldn't function, since there's nothing to <br />
grab onto it and animate it. Of course, souls are ultimately formless, and have <br />
no true size, shape, or density, so that kind of damage, -with the right <br />
knowledge- would be temporary at best, it it is knowledge you do not posses, <br />
nor do most living entities.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time -all- the recruits just stared at him mouths open, eye blank. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're losing-'em 'T'.&quot; Julio said calmly from his leaning spot on the wall <br />
where he was waiting Tabra's 'class' out. <br />
<br />
'if I help, I actually got all that.' Janice said honestly. <br />
<br />
Tabra sighed, &quot;Never mind, just remember that this isn't a video game, and <br />
the rules I just gave you do not mean you'll cause bonus damage with big red <br />
numbers appearing above the enemy's head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand that much.&quot; Viki said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you.&quot; Tabra spoke. &quot;Now that I failed miserably to get you to <br />
understand the base underlying nature of the relationship between the living <br />
and the spiritual plane of reality, I'll move onto some things you had -better- <br />
remember or you're a lot more likely to end up dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had their full attention. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;When you fight Karther, Tamthis, or any of their creations, remember this. <br />
Their magic is based totally on sand. If you can lure them into an air born fight, <br />
do it, the sand won't be able to react as fast to the mana they send through it <br />
with the extra mana they'll have to force through it to reach them up in the air. <br />
If this isn't an option, try to fight on any body of water. Now now, they're mostly <br />
still living things and need water to live as much as you. As I was saying, if <br />
drawing them into an air fight isn't an option, draw them to water and freeze it <br />
solid if you can. The sand is completely helpless if trapped within ice. Finally, <br />
if none of these are options, use heat based techniques if you can manage <br />
them, the mana that Karther's magic and thus Tamthis and his creations use is <br />
tailored made to go through sand, NOT glass. <br />
<br />
Remember this warning too, just cause you smash something made of sand <br />
doesn't mean it'll stay smashed, since it's just sand, unless it's base structure <br />
is changed, such as say, melted into glass, it can be reanimated and reformed <br />
with a fresh does of mana from the enemy. <br />
<br />
With that said, also remember your divine energies and Karther's sand magic <br />
do not function on the same principles. But you both still have your limits and <br />
reserves, even Tamthis' mana levels are NOT unlimited. Since as you'll <br />
remember when you were Karther's slaves that you were still able to function <br />
as independent entities, Karther wasn't able to constantly feed you new magic <br />
through the castle, in other words, just cause your enemy pulls itself back <br />
together after you scatter them across the landscape, -doesn't- mean they <br />
didn't feel it, nor does it mean they can do it an unlimited number of times.&quot; <br />
Tabra stopped speaking for a moment before looking at his 'students' with a <br />
smile and fake expectation before speaking again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then...  how many of you can actually -repeat- what I just said?&quot; <br />
<br />
Three of the recruits looked taken off guard, Viki spoke in a calm voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said sir, lead the enemy in air to air combat first, water combat second, <br />
or lastly transmute any sand we encounter into glass. Remember the enemy <br />
can regenerate, but can -not- do it an unlimited number of times. Is that correct <br />
sir?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabra was impressed. &quot;Good Viki. That was on the money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing. You don't have time to ask your buddies to repeat themselves <br />
usually in my line of work.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful.&quot; Lisa said out of the blue, not looking at Viki directly, her voice just <br />
loud enough to be heard. &quot;Remember what Natalie said, she was a solider, <br />
you're a cop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Viki looked at her understandingly. &quot;And soldiers are trained to kill while cops <br />
are trained to keep the peace I know Lisa, thanks for the reminder thou.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all have that now don't we?&quot; Luna pointed out. &quot;Thanks to the bastard <br />
prince.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Tabra took over. &quot;Implanted knowledge and skill never have been, and <br />
never will be, a substitute for actual experience, something nearly all of you <br />
lack. While Julio overstated his case, that is ultimately what he was trying to <br />
show you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Lisa got out. <br />
<br />
Viki nodded, &quot;Don't worry, I won't forget.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna moaned. &quot;Got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot; Erica copied. <br />
<br />
&quot;And don't forget.&quot; Tabra said, &quot;You all had that fighting skill when you were all <br />
together and Karther sic you on me. And I was holding back because you <br />
were innocent victims. Do -not- think of your hands on combat and your new <br />
talents as separate. That was your mistake when fighting Julio. Erica, you <br />
totally forgot the rest of your abilities when Julio dodged your kick like martial <br />
arts were all you could do. Luna, there were at least seven different ways you <br />
could have knocked Julio him off balance when he grabbed you. Lisa... you <br />
did the smart thing by standing by and OBSERVING the situation before <br />
making your decision. Viki, the female form we're all stuck with is more limber, <br />
quicker, and more angle than it's counterpart, but it -also- has a few extra <br />
vulnerable spots you must always be aware of. As Julio pointed out, he beat <br />
you basically because he knows how inexperienced you are and how to <br />
exploit it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we'll be wearing body armor when we fight for real.&quot; Erica pointed out. <br />
&quot;It's not like he can gromp us through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't expect that to be a safe all, protect all solution, you will find yourself in <br />
situations when you're vulnerable. And -finally- Julio's trick shouldn't have <br />
held you for more than a few seconds, tops! When trapped in a pain field like <br />
that, your best solution is blow your own fuses, blow out your own circuit <br />
breakers and your motor functions should automatically reset. In particular <br />
since Julio was distracted by his transformation and couldn't have <br />
compensated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Luna protested. &quot;We're just learning here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EXACTLY! I've bent the rules enough by changing you into my race. That <br />
power that's now a part of you isn't a child's toy, you need to -learn- how to <br />
use it. Remember my fight with Karther, I was able to catch him off guard with <br />
a revolver, a non-magical mundane weapon. Remember that if nothing else.  <br />
But above all I want you all to remember, once you take part of this war <br />
against Karther's intent. That won't be the end. No, it'll be only the beginning <br />
for you, for you won't be just part of this war.  But you'll ultimately be recruited <br />
The War, between Loyalist and Rebel angels: demons. You won't be able to <br />
escape it no matter how hard you try now. But I can still give you all a chance <br />
to walk away from this right now. Not all of our kind are sentenced to fight, <br />
some of us got off easy. While you've already closed the door behind you on -<br />
what- you are, there is no changing your spirits back into what they were <br />
anymore than a man can walk backwards into the ocean to become a fish, <br />
you still don't need to be soldiers. There are purposes beyond an Angel's <br />
existence well beyond fighting. Me, or one of the senior members of our kind <br />
can help you find your purpose.  But once you have taken up a weapon, and <br />
do battle now, not a practice fight, not a skirmish, but engage a -true- life or <br />
death fight with something to lose and something to gain. You won't be able to <br />
use the excuse 'it's not my nature' or 'I can't do it' or 'I couldn't bring myself to' <br />
with them, believe me, I tried myself once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we're angels, how can we die?&quot; Erica asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are alive in every sense of the word, just like Julio, Tamthis, myself, your <br />
grandma's house plants, and your uncle's goldfish. But you are also a super <br />
natural entity, inside a flesh and blood shell. But like I told you, that won't <br />
make death, any more pleasant, or any easier.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;We might die if we win anyway.. right?&quot; Lisa asked with sad, scared eyes.  <br />
Tabra felt pity. She let Lisa continue. &quot;I mean, you keep saying that Angels, -<br />
us-, we aren't normally supposed to -have- bodies, that.... that's... that's a <br />
human trait.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Tabra SO wished that she didn't need to explain this. <br />
<br />
&quot;THIS is why converting living entities into angel is -not- supposed to be done <br />
unless you've got everything at stake. You all had lives to live before Karther <br />
kidnapped you. You still had lives to live when you were rescued and brought <br />
here. But Lisa is right, bodies are a human trait, and you, are no longer <br />
human in any sense of the word,&quot; <br />
<br />
Lisa let out a few tears, Viki comforted her feeling a few tears of her own. Luna <br />
just kicked the sand. Erica, just shuddered. <br />
<br />
Tabra was stunned, Janice had taken a page from Tabra's memory and said it <br />
herself. <br />
<br />
'My act of kindness to you.' Janice said calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;But like I keep telling you, only because I want you to remember.&quot; Tabra said. <br />
&quot;Getting killed, won't be pleasant. And it's not a video game, you will NOT <br />
magically get a new replacement body that'll pop into existence when your <br />
current one dies. It doesn't work like that. AND!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra's voice was so booming with that one word it echoed through the cave. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just because the body you have is just a shell, doesn't mean it more than <br />
shell when you were human! The body you have was -never- you. Your are <br />
yourself, your memories, your decisions, your emotions, your -soul-!  And <br />
there is one other important thing to remember. You have no idea when you'd <br />
be 'reassigned' a new body, or 'taken off the streets' you could have your <br />
venue changed as soon as your sisters are freed, or you could be given male <br />
bodies a century after living in your current ones, or you could have muzzles <br />
and boobs on Judgment Day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh...&quot; Luna said, then burst out laughing. &quot;Just like when we were... -<br />
human-.&quot; Luna looked at Erica. &quot;We have no clue when we'll die! We have no <br />
clue what'll become of us when we die! We just have to do our best with <br />
whatever time we have!&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna was laughing so hard that her gut hurt. Finally she calmed down and <br />
breathed out, &quot;Sorry, it's just too funny.&quot; She said in totally good humor. <br />
<br />
Lisa injected lightly, &quot;I think the words you're looking for are 'Divine Comedy.'&quot;<br />
<br />
'Who would have thought Luna would take it the best?' Janice thought. <br />
<br />
'Her apparently.' <br />
<br />
Thankfully Luna's laugh managed to reduce some of the tension in the room. <br />
So Tabra was able to pop the question. <br />
<br />
&quot;My offer is still open. The door isn't closed yet.&quot; Tabra said, &quot;You can still <br />
chose not to fight and find another place in this new existence you've asked <br />
for yourselves. -But- this'll be your last chance. Once you've made your <br />
decision now, your fate will be sealed to ultimately fight Karther and Tamthis' <br />
forces. I won't lie to you. What I want to happen, what you want to happen, is <br />
to free everyone still a mind controlled slave to Karther's cause, but even with <br />
all the training I can give you, all the preparations you can make, you might <br />
still find yourself backed into a corner were you will have to kill or be killed <br />
and thus cut our chances of saving everyone else. . . . I'd normally give you a <br />
lot longer to think about this, but the sooner we teach you the ropes the better. <br />
Tamthis is -not- just sitting on her tails waiting for you to come, she is making <br />
preparations. So please, I ask you, if you want to walk away, you're free to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think after everything so far I'm gonna quit now? Get real!&quot; Luna stepped <br />
foreword. <br />
<br />
&quot;In for a penny, in for a pound.&quot; Erica stepped foreword. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't be much of a older sister to all of you or our sisters still Karther's <br />
slaves if I turned tail NOW!&quot; Viki stepped foreword. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm with all of you to the end!&quot; Lisa built up and stepped foreword <br />
determination in her pools of blood. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right then!&quot; Janice cheered for her sisters. &quot;Then let's begin.&quot; Tabra finish, <br />
a few particles of sand blew upwards in a momentary upward spiral of wind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Creation.&quot; Julio ordered. Matter and energy from nowhere shaped and <br />
formed into a fencing sword in Julio's hand. The light glinted off his actor's <br />
glasses and brown hair. <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice formed a hand scythe out of glowing white proto-matter and <br />
grabbed their hair in their other hand. In one swift motion she chopped the <br />
greater mass of hair from her skull, leaving her with dark red hair that ended <br />
on her neck. The long mass of hair hit the sandy ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Lisa gasped slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going into -battle-.&quot; Tabra reminded them. &quot;That means minor vanities <br />
have to go. And that means long hair, since you all used to be males, I <br />
assume that's no problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
The four recruits looked at each other, then all took little steps back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to hold them down?&quot; Julio asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You stay out of this.&quot; Janice said. <br />
<br />
What stunned Janice was how much she was missing her own long hair <br />
already, she guessed she had gotten used to it. <br />
<br />
Her sense of duty kicking in, Viki decided to set an example for her younger <br />
sisters and stepped closer to her senior with stern look on her face. &quot;Let me <br />
do it myself.&quot; She said firmly. trustingly, Tabra handed over the hand scythe. <br />
<br />
With only a moment's hesitation Viki took her brown hair and cut off the <br />
excess leaving her with a hair cut much like Tabra's/Janice's now. She then <br />
looked at the other three recruits. &quot;Want me to do it for you, or can you do it <br />
yourselves?&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna, never one to be pegged as a 'little girl' stomped up to Viki, without a <br />
'please' snatched the scythe from her hands and did the job, though what <br />
remained of her white hair stood up more than Viki's. <br />
<br />
Lisa and Erica looked at each other. Erica pushed Lisa ever so gently <br />
foreword. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for volunteering to be next Erica.&quot; Tabra said sternly. <br />
<br />
Erica started, realized her mistake, almost tried to make a break for it, but Viki <br />
blocked her escape while Luna came up behind her with the scythe. &quot;Don't <br />
worry little sister, won't hurt a bit.&quot; Luna said and not even asking Erica to <br />
stand still loped the back length hair off the silver fox with the speed of an <br />
executioner's axe, nicking one millimeter of fur off the back of her neck in the <br />
process. <br />
<br />
Erica felt the back of her neck, found it lacking, and glared at Luna. &quot;Hey be <br />
careful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was. Otherwise you wouldn't be complaining.&quot; It took a few seconds for the <br />
meaning of Luna's words to settle in. <br />
<br />
Viki politely took the scythe from Luna and looked at her smaller sibling. <br />
&quot;Lisa? It's your turn.&quot; She said politely and not forcefully. <br />
<br />
Lisa stood there for a moment, then walked foreword, held her hand out. Viki <br />
gave her the scythe. Hand shaking ever so slightly, Lisa pulled her sandy <br />
beige hair taunt, and cut it short so it was like the others. <br />
<br />
Tabra/Janice said. &quot;Julio.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clean the mess up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio glared at Janice/Tabra but did as he was asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Line up, faces foreword.&quot; Tabra said, the recruits complied. She willed the <br />
scythe back into her hands and reformed it spiked double ended staff. &quot;Let's <br />
get down to business.&quot; Tabra did a fighting demonstration shift weapons once <br />
every minute or so. &quot;Just as humans are not broken down into biological <br />
classes like ants are, every angel contains within themselves the potential for <br />
all abilities and elements. We are NOT the Greek pantheon, we are <br />
messengers. What kind of message you carry depends on how your talents <br />
and skill develop. Normally you'd go through a long process of finding what <br />
you're best suited for, but instead I'm going to put you through the meat <br />
grinder and teach you all universal elements to defending yourself, keeping <br />
yourself and team mates alive, as of course the fine art of inflicting non-fatal <br />
and fatal injury. And sorry Luna, we won't be getting to the destructo-blasts <br />
until near the end when I'm sure you won't blow yourselves up. First lesson of <br />
today.&quot; Tabra stopped her expo on a chained-mace and spoke darkly, &quot;Armor <br />
creation.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Oh no.' Janice said nearly out loud.</p>
