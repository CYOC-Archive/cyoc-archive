<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nothing really eventful happened durring the night that Alec couldn&#39;t handle by herself. Now that she was a Succubus, her self confidence and ability to hold her own in combat had skyrocketed. Especially in a 1v1 and often 1v2 scenarios as she could simply fuck whatever was attacking them to death. That was what happened durring that night as well. <br />
<br />
For a total of 3 seperate instances over the course of the night, Alec had been fucked in order to protect her sleeping friends. Although she kept telling herself it was to protect Vivian, Andrea, and Neke, she had no qualms about doing it either, and secretly hoped she would be able to do more of these &quot;night watches&quot; as they continued to travel together in the future. Of course she wasn&#39;t displeased with sleeping with the other girls, but sleeping would be the real issue because as of last night, she no longer needed it. After her second round of &quot;interruptions&quot; she had leveled up her (Succubus&#39;s love) skill to lvl.2, which should have been a good thing if not for some of the additional &quot;benefits&quot; included with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Succubus&#39;s Love: passive lvl.2)&quot;<br />
&quot;You have by now accepted your new life as a Succubus in full, and are now ready for the next step. Already being at the pinnacle of feminine beauty, why would you still need your beauty sleep? The truth is, you don&#39;t! As long as you have had sex in the last 72 hours, you will never need to sleep and will be completely immune to all sleep inducing magic, Lucky you! And, now that sleeping is no longer a concern, you now have more time for sex. However finding a partner can be challenging, especially when a distance away from others. So now you can just fly to them yourself using your new wings!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell wrote this flavor text?&quot; Alec wondered as she kept reading over her new additions.<br />
<br />
&quot;New skills aquired: (Sleep immunity*: Passive lvl. MAX), (Exhaustion immunity*: lvl. MAX), (Flight: lvl.1)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; * indicates attached conditional requirement(s) in order for use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Conditional requirements(s): have had penetrative sex within the last 72 hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New Succubus Trait Aquired: Succubus Hip Wings (permanent, can&#39;t be removed or turned off)&quot;<br />
<br />
It was that last part that was now a concern for Alec. Protruding out from just above the hem of her makeshift skirt was a pair of large black wings, which when folded to her sides, would be taller than her by a head, and had their tips ending just a few inches above the ground. She could angle them down though, so that they angled forward in front of her, and shrink them down to about a quarter of their full size, but couldn&#39;t hide them completely. And, when shrunk, she could only glide at best.<br />
<br />
The sun was just comming up now, and soon Vivian and Andrea would wake up too. Thankfully, it seemed that Vivian had regained some of her old height back too, but her 6 breasts went completely unchanged, still creating 6 distinct lumps under the sleeping bag. It was interesting how she couldn&#39;t even imagine her without having 6 boobs. After all, that is all she has ever seen her have. <br />
<br />
For the next half hour, Alec just sat by their campsite keeping guard while stroking Neke. The two of them had gotten much closer after Alec had fed her some of her breast milk. Hmm, now that she thought about it, how did her milk taste? Alec realized that hasn&#39;t even tried it herself yet. And quickly grabbed her left nipple, bringing it up to her mouth. She was just bairly able to get her mouth around it, as she had to stretch to even reach it. But now that she had it, all that was left was to suck. And suck she did... for the next 20 minutes. Her milk was incredibly tasty. No wonder Neke was so happy to drink it. She felt she could suck on her tits all day and never feel full, or empty for that matter. There was an odd peacefulness to it. Everything around her seemed to be quiet, and calm. Although that could be just because it was morning, not even the birds were cherping, which hinted towards somethine else simply because it was too quiet.<br />
<br />
Indeed it wasn&#39;t just the morning, as Alec smelled a new scent approaching their campsite. Releasing her nipple, she enlarged her wings and silently jumped into the sky to get a better view. What she saw was that a single person was walking nearby. Not directly towards their group, but still within the general vacinity. Then the person turned and looked directly at her, and in the next second was standing next to her, in mid air. &quot;Are those 3 down there your pray, Miss. Demon?&quot; Said the person, who Alec felt sounded like a woman but couldn&#39;t tell for sure since they covered their body and face. However she could figure out what she meant because she pointed towards the Vivian, Andrea, and Neke. Alec could tell that this woman wasn&#39;t showing any hostility towards her, so she felt it was fine to answer. &quot;And if they are?&quot; Alec asked, not entirely sure of the woman&#39;s reason for asking, so she tried probing for the woman&#39;s intention.<br />
&quot;Now now, I didn&#39;t mean it like that. I am mearly asking you to please reconsider attacking them while you are this close to the town. I won&#39;t go out of my way to hunt you down elsewhere, but this area is under my jurisdiction, and those 3 are currently under the guild&#39;s protection while they are inside the guild&#39;s territory, or any designated rest points like this one.&quot; Politely warned the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that is the case then that isnt a problem. I am with them, they are my party members, and I too actually belong to the guild. So don&#39;t worry. I am currently just acting as their night watch since I can&#39;t sleep. I have no intentions of harming any of them if I can help it.&quot; Alec explained, suddenly releaved that this wasn&#39;t going to become an issue where she would need to fight someone. Monsters, witches and wolves are one thing, but killing a person was something she wasn&#39;t sure she was ready for yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, that is a rather unusual claim from a demon. Especially about being their party member. But if you are a member of our guild, then by all means, please show me your id card, that&#39;s if you even have one. As far as I know, there is not a single Demon registered here.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can, but who are you first? I would rather not give out my info to some unknown stranger.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pardon me, I am Cecelia Hornsmontier, head of public order and chief enforcer of the Adventurer&#39;s Guild in this town.&quot; Said the woman, who then proceeded to remove her facial coverings while showing Alec her own id card. Sure enough she was exactly who the card said she was. And now that she know she was someone trustworthy, Alec felt that it was ok to show hers.<br />
&quot;I see. Then if you could please verify this for me&quot; Alec said showing her own. <br />
&quot;I see, so you are not an average demon, but a Succubus? That changes thing a bit I&#39;m afraid. However I can confirm that this ID card is real enough, so I apologize for the earlier assumption. However, I am sorry for the inconvenience, but I will need you, and if they wish to, your party as well, to still accompany me to HQ for a bit.&quot; <br />
&quot;Um, sure. But please let me go wake them up first.&quot; <br />
Cecelia noded and they both descended. It was then that Alec just realized it, but Cecelia was standing on nothing just now for the entire time. Her thought seemed to get through to Cecelia though. &quot;I have a special ability which allows me to interact with the air as if it is a solid surface where ever I choose to do so.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. So that was it. By the way, I know you saw my ID card already, but I am Alec Hansen, although I think I am going to have to change my first name soon to better match my body. But you can just call me Alec for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec land next to the sleeping bag and gently shake awake Vivian and explain the situation. Then she went to do the same for Andrea, who was completely inside of the sleeping bag. Alec shook awake the human sized lump in the sleeping bag, and sat back as Andrea groggily crawled out, still tired from yesterday&#39;s fun. &quot;Mmmm, what is it Alec? Are we under attack? We should be fine since we are inside a guild resting area though. Let me sleep some more ok? I am sure you can just fuck whoever is planning on bothering us if you want anyways, so can you handle it? I know first hand that you are very competent and have a lot of skill at pleasing people, even if they are women. So I&#39;m sure you can handle them.&quot; Complained Andrea, who was just about to crawl back inside the sleeping bag when...<br />
&quot;AHEM! Did I just hear my little sister self admit that she has had first hand experience with how this Succubus pleases people?&quot; Sternly said a now very annoyed Cecelia. Andrea eyes shot open wide as she slowly looked up behind her. &quot;Ah, hey sis... What beings you around here? You look well. I think you may have misunderstood me though. What I said was...&quot; said Andrea slowly, and before she could finish the sentance, she had already hid back inside the sleeping bag.</p>
