<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stripes appeared in her bedroom holding a sheath of computer printouts. She looked around at all her possessions that reminded her of the human life, the pictures, awards, and posters. She chuckled. That phase of her life was over with no regrets. The cover story about Jennifer attending a private school was already discussed and would be implemented on Monday. Besides, it’s not like Jennifer would never be seen again. Stripes would have to play her on occasion to keep up appearances.<br />
<br />
There were two  things Stripes needed, her keys and her cell phone. She grabbed the phone off the charger and programed in a special number. It was the direct line to the main barn at the ranch. Master Equus himself would be answering that line tonight. Working her cell with her hooved fingers was a minor challenge, but ultimately she got the number programmed in speed dial.<br />
<br />
Stripes concentrated for a moment and the illusion of Jennifer Vollum surrounded her. She smiled as she strolled through the empty house to the garage where her tainted car awaited.  She unlocked it and climbed in as normal. <br />
<br />
The fresh scents of Fries, Mul, and her own taint made her smile. She couldn’t help but think of those stallion’s cocks as she backed her car out and hit the road. She would be seeing them again shortly, unfortunately with no time to play. She would have other beastly breeding partners tonight. That was fine. At least her continual sexual itch would get a good scratching.<br />
<br />
It was 8PM in Glendale. The streets still had a lot of traffic, but all the riding stables had closed by now. If there were people around they should be stable hands working late, or the odd security guard. They would be corrupted as they were discovered. Master Equus had indicated that he was not concerned as to how, or what form they received. The thought of tainting some humans made Stripes smile as she drove.<br />
<br />
The directions off the internet quickly got her to the first target, the Glendale Park Stables. This place was actually run by the city and provided everything from riding horses to ponies for kiddie rides, She pulled into the empty parking lot and found the place deserted except for the assortment of animals. <br />
<br />
Stripes called the special number. The line was answered with a simple, “Yes?”<br />
<br />
“At location one, opening a gate.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good Stripes, the boys are ready.” Master Equus sounded  relaxed. “As soon as they come though, head to the next stop.”<br />
<br />
“You got it boss.” Stripes ended the call and opened the gate. Fries, Mul, and two tainted beasts stepped though. Stripes stroked both of their cocks making them whinny and stomp their hooves.<br />
<br />
“You missed us”, Mul laughed. Stripes just grinned back. Fries nuzzled Stripe’s ample breasts.<br />
<br />
“Us, tomorrow night, party”, Stripes swished her tail. “Your scents permeate my car.<br />
Both the stallions grinned back at her.<br />
<br />
“You better get moving before we have that party now”, Fries gave Stripes a playful swat on her striped ass.<br />
<br />
Stripes neighed, then trotted back to her car. She grabbed her pad of printouts off the passenger seat and ripped off  the first page. Directions from this stable to the next now presented themselves. Stripes had to admit that Amy had done a hell of a job planning this little adventure.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later she was in an exclusive area where the homeowners kept a common stable. There did not appear to be anyone around. She pulled off the road and gave Master Equus another safe arrival call. This time Carl and Corey stepped though the portal with two more tainted beasts.<br />
<br />
Stripes had seen these two from afar, but hadn’t really met them. To her they appeared the original odd couple. Carl, the large mustang fiend with curling horns, gigantic cock, and a curiously human face smiled at her. Corey, the clydesdale that was not much larger than she was trotted on after leading the beasts. Corey waved at Stripes, but his attention seemed firmly focused on Carl’s tail.<br />
<br />
“You boys have fun. See you at the next stop.” Stripes smiled at them. She planned to try them both out when time permitted. Maybe together as they seemed to be a team? Stripes grinned as she trotted back to the car swishing her tail, perverted thoughts filling her head.<br />
<br />
In another ten minutes Stripes arrived at the third site.<br />
<br />
“You better get started there on your own”, Master Equus said. “I’ll call as soon as one of the teams returns so keep the phone close.”<br />
<br />
Stripes smiled, some sex at last. “Understood Master Equus. I’ll be expecting your call.”<br />
<br />
Stripes climbed out of the car and was greeted by a quiet chorus of moos. She grabbed her directions and quickly determined that this was the correct address, then she spotted the stables and small paddock. Apparently this place was a commercial dairy with a small private stable attached. <br />
<br />
The sound of some kind of pump from the dairy caught her attention. The last thing Stripes needed was some human waltzing in while she was impaled on a stallion, so she cloaked herself and ventured into the dairy. <br />
<br />
Stripes discovered a light on in the back part of the dairy from the milking room. It appeared to be the source of the noise. She approached quietly on her hooves and peered into the room, She had to stifle a laugh.<br />
<br />
None other than Bart Thaxton was there with his friend Billy Green. They were laying in one of the milking stalls. Both were naked laying on their backs with stupid grins on their faces, Each had a sucker clamp from the milking machine fastened on their cocks.<br />
<br />
Memories flooded Stripes. Jennifer had been unfortunate enough to date Bart for about a week. She quickly discovered that he was an abusive, ill-mannered bully. It was amazing how his sidekick Billy was always around to help shove people around. Wisely Jennifer had ended the relationship. Her parents had seen to it that Bart stayed out of her life.<br />
 <br />
Come to think of it, Bart’s parents owned this place. Some how they needed to be corrupted, but the thought of having either of them in her pussy was revolting. Frankly they didn’t deserve the fun that went with being a lust demon. They needed something else, some other form of corruption. Something that would give them some just deserts.</p>
