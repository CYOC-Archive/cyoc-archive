<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You take the hoop with you and hide it in a backpack. It&#39;s bendy and small enough to fit in it so you don&#39;t have much problems. <br />
<br />
You arrive at the beach and retrieve the hoop, you slowly walk to the sea and dip your feet in it. It&#39;s very cold. You walk as far as you can, until your chest is covered by the water. Now you try grabbing a hold of the ring, and place it in front of you.<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and get ready to go through it, but suddenly you&#39;re hit by something and get pushed around violently, only to start getting sucked into the sea itself. It was a huge wave.<br />
<br />
You desperately try to get a hold of the sand, of the rocks, of anything you could get a grasp of, but to no avail, you get dragged into the watery depths of the sea.<br />
<br />
Spinning around in the deep, you start feeling unconscious, when suddenly you slightly open your eyes, the adrenaline letting you see despite the hurting salt of the water. The hoop! You quickly try to swim towards it, but the strong currents of the sea grab you and the hoop once again, and you start spinning uncontrollably once again. You cough, running out of air, and your vision slowly fades to black. <br />
<br />
Until.<br />
<br />
You suddenly gasp for air. Wait. That isn&#39;t right. You&#39;re still underwater and spinning... <br />
<br />
You look around and manage to see that everything is smaller...<br />
You look to your sides and see tiny orange fins.<br />
You&#39;re a goldfish! You desperately try to stabilize your smaller body until you feel a shadow cross over you; you&#39;re crossing through the hoop once again.<br />
<br />
You open your eyes and see everything blurry with a pinkish tone. You&#39;re a jellyfish!<br />
<br />
And you keep spinning and spinning around the hoop, transforming into every animal possible.<br />
<br />
You become a tuna, a mackerel, a starfish, a crab, a swordfish, until you feel yourself hit the hoop with your back. You look down and see dolphin fins.<br />
<br />
You try to swim out of the hoop but the currents squeeze you into it. <br />
Your significantly bigger body can&#39;t fit through, your tail pressing the hoop painfully. The currents drag you once again and send you and the hoop even deeper into the sea. You get thrashed around and thrown to the deep soil. Your body painfully breaks by the horrible pressure exerted into it, and it limply squeezes into the hoop, destroying it in the process. You close your eyes and fade to black.<br />
<br />
When you open your eyes, you see you&#39;re swimming instinctively, and you feel strangely energized, a glowing light suddenly fades as you snap out of the daze. You look around but notice your vision field is limited, you can&#39;t move your neck, and looking behind you makes your whole body move with you. You look down and see the pieces of the hoop float around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; You think. Thankfully your instincts let you swim around with ease, but your clumsy body doesn&#39;t let you get at least a hold of the hoop pieces.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you feel your whole body throbbing, as you feel your surroundings get smaller. Confused, you try to swim back to surface, with the hope of finding a mirror or something to see what you&#39;ve become. Every now and then, you feel a slight bloating sensation, you feel yourself becoming wider and wider... <br />
<br />
You reach the surface, but when you try to approach it, everyone starts running back to the shore. You don&#39;t take long to realize what happened. &quot;SHARK!&quot; ...you hear dozens of screams...<br />
<br />
Scared by the uproar you might cause, you quickly swim back to the depths, not minding how much growth spurts you&#39;re feeling. Looking at the animals of the soil, you realize you must be around the size of a tiger shark. &quot;Why so much fuzz for such a small shark?&quot; You think. Then you shudder, you don&#39;t know why, but after seeing a small fish you enter a sudden <br />
frenzy, you don&#39;t even realize when you eat the creature whole. &quot;What... Just happened...&quot; You try to get a hold of the situation, but your hunger and bloodthirst does not stop there. Soon you quickly move around the depths eating everything you can find. &quot;More...&quot; You unexpectedly growl in your mind... &quot;I need MORE!!&quot; <br />
<br />
You eat fish after fish, your speed unnatural for any aquatic creature. And you keep growing larger and larger. Your slim tiger shark body gets wider, sturdier, and way stronger. Your skin thickens and you can fit whole groups of fish in your mouth. In your mind you know you&#39;re a great white now. Your teeth get sharper, features more vicious, even your shark slit widens and gaps open, as two slimey rods protrude out of it, growing so thick and long, leaking out all your tiger shark cum, just to be replaced by your rightful great shark sperm. <br />
<br />
&quot;MORE!!&quot; your mental voice sounds deeper and louder, more monstrous.<br />
You eat every unfortunate thing that gets anywhere near you. It doesn&#39;t last long until you start tipping boats and eating everything inside. You don&#39;t know how long your frenzy will be, but it feels so short to you... Barely a few minutes.<br />
<br />
In reality, days pass, and sightings of a monstrous shark are spreading all over the country. The magic of the hoop let&#39;s you know all this, brief mental images of the terror you&#39;re causing. You grin maliciously as your huge shark penises leave a trail of sperm that stretches for miles. Eating, destroying and growing gives you immense pleasure.<br />
<br />
The humans try to trap you by hanging large fishes on military boats, hoping you fall for the bait and finally die at the hands of gunfire, but you&#39;re smarter than that. You approach them from below and tip their useless ship like paper boats. They&#39;re underestimating you. You quickly eat the fish and the crew, only to disappear in the ocean once again.<br />
<br />
The sightings only get worse. You&#39;re nicknamed the &quot;The Devil&quot;, the largest white shark ever recorded in history, feared by all, cunning and vicious, faster than any vessel and strong enough to tip boats with a single push.<br />
<br />
After feasting on a sperm whale, another growth spurt strikes you, growing into a whale sized monster shark, skin growing thick as steel, bone structure becoming impossibly dense, teeth and jaws becoming huge and monstrous, your gums growing even more teeth. You roar as your double penises grow leathery and thick as a boat, reaching your belly and spitting out gallons of great white cum, followed by the chunky, yellow and primitive sperm of something monstrous and prehistoric.<br />
<br />
You can tip destroyer boats with your dorsal fin, and your teeth and jaws are strong enough to bite half an armored ship off, as the poor bastards that tried to lure you with a great white carcass found out.<br />
<br />
The world economy suffered considerably as even the largest of the cargo ships refused to sail because of you, hundreds have been lost already. The ocean population of any area you visited always ends up being cut by half, and small coastal towns are slowly becoming inhabited not only by the monster lurking in every ocean of the world, but the usual tsunami that arrives whenever it gets too close.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re feared and respected everywhere in the world, and that just makes your pride and hunger grow more and more, and your crotch to grow and feel even better.<br />
<br />
A whole whale observation center disappeared when observing a few sperm whales. They couldn&#39;t notice that what they thought was the dark depths of the ocean they&#39;ve been observing unnoticed by hours was actually your maw wide open, dragging the whole station to your mouth.<br />
<br />
All the hostile missions against you have failed. Not only their ships are conveniently nutritious and bite sized, but you&#39;re so fast and huge that jets and bombers get caught mid air with a simple jump whenever they try to harm you.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s dread in every sea when you grow large enough to eat blue whales whole.<br />
The whole world is shook when they finally realize you&#39;re the largest animal in history. A 200 feet long monster shark.<br />
<br />
You roar viciously in victory and your penises let out seas worth of cum after claiming your rightful title. You grow even more monstrous, skin becoming thick, almost rocky texture, and near pitch black color. Red highlights all over, including your beastly red/yellow eyes. Your teeth become as big as large cars, as they gain the texture of saws. You grow bone armor and spikes all over, as you stretch even larger, even wider, even more muscular. You grin with your perfect rows of teeth. Dozens of them containing hundreds of car sized blades. As per usual. You let out all your old cum just to have your glands refill with the alpha predator sperm. Your penises becoming barbed, huge, and meaty, cumslits so wide that you could fit fishing boats in them.<br />
<br />
You just have one more task to do four your frenzy.<br />
<br />
You swim swiftly as thousands and thousands of missiles and bombs try to at least make you bleed, but you&#39;re just way too powerful to be bothered. If anything they feel like gushes of air.<br />
<br />
The military is growing desperate. They&#39;re seriously planning on nuking the Devil as conventional missiles can&#39;t even scratch the impossibly thick and impenetrable hide of the shark. <br />
<br />
The decision is made and two thermonuclear bombs strike right next to you. You let out a slight roar in pain as your body burns, thankfully, it barely feels like a sunburn. A few pieces of flesh that got burned or tore off are instantly regenerated. You&#39;re furious.<br />
<br />
A horrible and dreadful feeling is felt all across the fleet as they see the impossibly large dark shadow move across the ocean depths. <br />
You grin as you&#39;re ready to let out all the frustration these pests have made you go through...<br />
<br />
You suddenly jump with all your forces, impossibly huge tsunamis wreck all the ships around you, the rest get thrown hundreds of meters inland. You set your eyes on the target. The largest carrier ever made, just to try and destroy you.<br />
<br />
You fall violently on it causing a huge dent, but you&#39;re not done yet. Holding to it with your weight, you bite off every weapon in it, leaving it completely useless as you&#39;re ready to deliver the final blow.<br />
You roar as your shark slit gaps wide once again, huge tentacles come out of them, each one bigger than most of the ships, you wrap them all over the carrier as you roar in pleasure. Your massive shark penises constricting the ship like a tin can, only to get penetrated through both of it&#39;s flanks by your organs. You thrash on board of the ship, slowly outgrowing it&#39;s already massive 3,000 feet of length. You let out a roar that can be heard across hundreds of miles as you squeeze the steel with a force that was thought only the earth itself was able to produce as you let millions of gallons of thick yellowish sperm fill the interior of the ship. It&#39;s massive structure can&#39;t even resist the load as it starts falling apart like a wet cardboard. You almost double it&#39;s size by the time you&#39;re done, and you throw yourself back into the ocean causing even bigger tsunamis that wash away every nearby settlement. With glee, you devour all the puny remainings of the fleet.<br />
<br />
You roar in victory as your penises retract to their slit, and you shake your head in confusion. &quot;What just happened?&quot; You think to yourself as one of your penises destroy a submarine as it&#39;s retreating back to it&#39;s sheat. &quot;What was that?&quot;. <br />
You&#39;re ignorant of everything that has happened, but it&#39;s better to leave it that way. You swim to the depths of the ocean, feeling satisfied, and strangely powerful.<br />
<br />
All around the world you&#39;re being monitored. A dark blue blob easily visible from space. Every single ship, government and creature in the sea avoids you. Everything is afraid of you. Everything respects you.<br />
You don&#39;t remember anything that happened since you became a tiger shark, but you have a feeling... no, an instinct of superiority deep within your mind that you&#39;re not fully aware of. You&#39;re actually unaware of almost everything, even time as you feel ages pass like minutes, your massive body has just kept growing over the decades, reaching the impossible size of 200 miles long. Algae, coral and whole rocky formations have grown all over your back, housing billions of creatures that call you home. In fact, most of your body is covered in algae and moss, making you one of most important lungs of the Earth. Science has classified you as a whole new ecosystem, new species developing on your surface, new kinds of algae that provide you with energy, mollusks and crabs that clean every surface, even a new species of fish has evolved in your groins that feeds exclusively on the remaining cum of your sheath and penises, the same cum that you release in billions of gallons every now and then, nurturing the oceans everywhere.<br />
Thanks to you, human presence has diminished significantly in the seas, and with the cum you expell you provide rich nutrients that allow ecosystems to heal and develop in a way that hasn&#39;t happened since millions of years ago.<br />
<br />
In every country, thousand of tonnes of food are dumped to appease the monster that rampaged across the world ages ago. The tale passed from generation to generation. Strangely, after some hours, no one calls you a monster anymore. You&#39;ve become a crucial part of the planet. You&#39;ve become the King. No, the GOD of the seas. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you don&#39;t even know what you are, nor can&#39;t remember what happened after being dragged by the waves, you just think of a way to find out what you&#39;ve become while eating the mysterious food pellets that are dropped from the surface. Are you still a goldfish?</p>
