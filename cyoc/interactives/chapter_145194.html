<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note: After reading the latest thread it appears the narrative I choose was not very popular. I had tried to establish a history for the character. My intent was not to chase off any potential authors willing to contribute so I have decided to take things in another direction. One of the great joys I’ve had is watching others add to the continueing narrative I’ve put forth. I hope you all have enjoyed my contributions to the site so without further ado I add this branch. I look forward to future authors adding their unique take on this story or in the other branch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kellie paused as she gazed at Zack and Mia. The two elementary school students both appeared to be getting along quite well. Mia was so thankful for the assistance of everyone in rescueing them. Zack was quite bashful though, the boy from her perspective appeared quite taken with the sandy haired girl.<br />
<br />
“Mary, Katie,” She called. “Can I talk to you two real quick?” Kellies friends nodded as they joined her. Pulling the girls closer she now whispered her observations to her friends. “Is it me or is Zack crushing on Mia over there.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Mary Elise now glanced at the two children, their eyes growing wide as they could see what Kellie is talking about. “Whoa your right,” Katie whispered. “He is crushing on her, and she looks a little taken by him.”<br />
<br />
“Can you blame them,” Mary Elise stated. “The boy did run to her rescue and he is a cute kid. Too bad they weren’t closer in age.”<br />
<br />
“What if they were though,” Kellie smirked. Mary Elise and Katie’s eyes went wide as they took in Kellies words. “That could be a bad idea,” Katie said flatly. “I mean not for nothing those two are protected by a freaking imp and a succubus. You start messing with them and your probably going to piss off Ayami and Rexie. You really want them angry with you?”<br />
<br />
“Well no,” Kellie mumbled. “But it seems like a wasted opportunity, they make a cute couple. Too bad they’re not closer in age. Maybe we could talk with the others before we do anything.”<br />
<br />
“If your going to do that you better run it by Ayami, Rexie, And Jack,” Katie said. “If they’re not cool with it than I would leave it alone.” Kellie nodded, considering the group had nearly come to blows transforming two children that meant so much to the group would destroy any good will built up between them in the last couple of hours. Kellie now called for Ayami, Rexie, and Jack to come and talk with them. As the warlock and demons approached, Kellie took a deep breath. “Ayami, Rexie,” Kellie said. “Wanted to thank you two for saving me and Jack.”<br />
<br />
“We did this for Jack,” Ayami said coldly. “And for Mia,” Rexie added. Kellie nodded, things weren’t off to the best start. “Hold up you two,” Jack said. “Look, Kellie and I talked. We kind of came to an agreement, we would let the other side do what they need to do without interference. Let’s not give Kellie the cold shoulder right of the rip.” Ayami and Rexie gave Jack a look of confusion before turning towards Kellie and apologizing. “Listen don’t sweat it you two,” Kellie stated. “I get it, we’re not exactly on the same side here. We were kind of brought into this to fight a common enemy. What I wanted to talk to you two about though was Zack and Mia.”<br />
<br />
“What about them,” Rexie asked raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Kellie started. “Have you two noticed how chummy those two are? If I were to bet I’d say they like eachother. Like REALLY like eachother.” Rexie and Ayami paused looking back at their wards. As the reality of the situation dawned on them their eyes grew wide in surprise. “Holy crap,” Ayami whispered. “Zack is crushing on your niece!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah looks like Mia likes Zack too,” Rexie said quietly. “That kid of yours better treat her right.”<br />
<br />
“My kid,” Ayami exclaimed. “I was going to say the same thing about your niece. Zacks younger than her remember. She better not hurt him or I’ll finish the job the Kitsune started Rexie.”<br />
<br />
Kellie stepped in between the imp and succubus before blows could be enxchanged. As they glared at one another Kellie now tried to play peacemaker. “Okay easy you two,” Kellie said quickly. “Don’t want you two tearing eachother to pieces. Obviously your very protective of both of them, I was just hoping I could get some information on the two before telling you my plan.”<br />
<br />
“Zack has been sick most of his life,” Ayami sighed. “He’s always been by himself. I...I was kind of his only friend.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah Mia was always a bit of a loner too,” Rexie sighed. “Unfortunately the girl is into things that most kids her age aren’t into. Mia’s a techie and a sweet natured girl. While other 11 year olds are starting to get into boy bands and teen stuff, she was more interested in school work and her family. She wasn’t exactly the most popular kid in her class.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smirked as she rubbed her chin thoughtfully, she had at first considered aging Zack up so the two could be friends. After hearing about how lonely the two kids were another idea came to mind, she knew exactly what needed to be done. “What if I told you I knew a group of kids who were very similar to them,” she said. “A group of girls who have very similar interests to Mia and have always treated everyone kindly. Would you two be interested in introducing Mia and Zack to them?”<br />
<br />
“We’re listening,” Rexie and Ayami responded. Kellie grinned. “Okay,” she said. “I know a girl named Gloria Turner. The girl is very similar to Mia and she’s alwasy treated everyone with kindness. I’m suggesting we introduce Mia and Zack to her and her friends.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds fair,” Jack shrugged. “But I’m sensing a But coming.”<br />
<br />
“Here’s the thing,” Kellie said. “Gloria is only 10. What I can do is use my ring to make Zack and Mia friends and classmates Gloria and her friends. The only problem, I would have to age up Zack and age down Mia. Before I did that I wanted your permission.”<br />
<br />
Jack rubbed his chin as he turned to Ayami and Rexie. “Your call you two,” he said. “Not sure how I feel about making Mia younger,” Rexie mumbled. “Even if it is only a year.” Ayami nodded as she thought about Zack. “Feel the same,” she said. “I don’t know if making Zack a year older would help him.”<br />
<br />
“Tell you what,” Kellie said. “We try it out on a temporary basis. Let Mia and Zack both be 10 for a month. I’ll make it so that they’re friends in the same grade, I mean they already go to the same school. If the kids are unhappy, I’ll return them to their original ages. Do we have a deal?”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Rexie shrugged. “I suppose but why are you willing to do this for us. Not for nothing we’re trying to take you down.”<br />
<br />
“Here’s the thing,” Kellie stated. “You don’t have to. I kind of get what Jack was talking about. Sure I don’t see us hanging out at each others houses but we both have to exist in this timeline. You helped save me, even it was because of something else. I want to return the favor and help you.”<br />
<br />
Ayami and Rexie turned towards one another, nodding first to eachother before glancing at Kellie. “Okay,” Ayami said. “I think we’re willing to give it a try.” Kellie smiled as she turned towards Katie. “Okay Katie gonna need some help with this.” Katie noddd as she now focused on the two elementary school kids.<br />
<br />
Zacks changes were remarkable as the boy went from 9 to 10. The skinny, sickly boy shot up in height, growing at least 3 inches as he experienced an incredible growth spurt. The boys body even appeared to strengthen slightly as he filled out, losing the weak and frail frame he had at 9. Now the boy appeared to be a slightly athletic fourth grader with shaggy dark hair and a cute face.<br />
<br />
Mia’s changes were much different though. The girl appeared to be just entering puberty. As she began to grow younger the group noticed as she shrank a few inches, her body losing the small curves puberty was only beginhg to bestow upon her. Mia’s face, which had only begun to show the slightest signs of maturity became childish once more. The sandy haired girl had gone from a girl just beginning to start her journey to womanhood to a girl at the peak of childhood. As the couple completed their transformations they shook their heads, smiling at one another before embracing the other in a tight hug of friendship.<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Rexie smirked. “Looks like those two are close friends.”<br />
<br />
“So it seems,” Ayami said quietly. “I’m glad they have eachother. Still if your niece breaks Zacks heart Rexie you and I are going to have serious problems.”<br />
<br />
“Goes double for me Ayami,” Rexie grinned. “That boy better not try any funny stuff.”<br />
<br />
Kellie grinned as she listened to the imp and succubus talk of their wards. She had offered an olive branch to the couple in hopes of maintaining the peace between the sides. Hopefully now Mia and Zack would be happy being friends with not only eachother but with Gloria and her friends. Regardless it would give her an opportunity to keep a close eye on the other side.</p>
