<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After an Hour or so drive, James finally arrives at the Zoo, he drives around to the back of the complex where all the offices and medical facility are located. The gates are already open, so he drives right through and stops the Van right outside the Zoo&#39;s Vet. When James opens the back of the Van, he finds that the “Tiger Cub” is still out cold and snoring. James opens the cage and carefully takes the “Animal” out and walks into the building where he is met by a young woman in her mid 20s.<br />
<br />
“Hey James,” she says, smiling, “I see you were successful.”<br />
<br />
James nods, “yep,” he says, “it wasn&#39;t so hard at all to get the powerful sleeping dart into it. I thought the dart would simply bounce off the thick fur coat.”<br />
<br />
The woman nods as she steps up and looks closely at the “Tiger”, “I guess you had luck to actually hit it where it&#39;s fur is thinner,” she says. She reaches out a hand and strokes the “Tiger&#39;s” head, “what a beautiful animal,” she whispers, then she shakes her head, “how can anyone be so cruel and make it think it were human and mess with it&#39;s body?”<br />
<br />
James shrugs, “I don&#39;t know,” he says, “at least it is safe now. Could you please bring me to the Doc? I believe he wants to examine it and my arms are getting tired.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, follow me to the examinations room,” the woman, Tina, says, “Mr. Fox has everything set up.” James nods and follows Tina to the room, they soon arrive and Tina opens the door, “just lie the Cub on the table,” she says, “the Doctor will be in shortly. Once you have laid the Animal on the Table, you may leave, we&#39;ll do the rest.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good,” James says, laying the “Cub” on the table, “I have other stuff to do,” with that he leaves, without looking back.<br />
<br />
After James has left, Tina walks up to the “Cub” looking down at it, she shakes her head once again, “poor little fella,” she says, stroking the “Tiger&#39;s” head, “don&#39;t worry, you are safe now and we&#39;ll help you.”<br />
<br />
A door opens on the other side of the room and a tall man in a lab coat enters, “I see the Tiger Cub has arrived,” Mr. Fox says, walking up to the table. He does a quick check on the “Tiger” and shakes his head, “there really are evil people out there,” he mutters. Mr. Fox turns to Tina, “even though the Cub is still out, we don&#39;t know for how long, and I don&#39;t want any hassle,” he says, “so please hook it up to the sleeping-gas machine.”<br />
<br />
Tina does as told, she rolls the machine next to the Table and takes the face mask and puts it over the “Tiger&#39;s” mouth and nose. She then starts the machine, the gas starts to flow and Jared is unaware what is happening as he continues to sleep. Tina then turns to the Vet, “so, what will you be doing,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“I will be doing the standard procedures, like taking blood, give it the standard vaccinations, listen to it&#39;s heart and lungs,” Mr. Fox says as he prepares the syringes.<br />
<br />
Tina walks up to the Vet, “anything I can do to help, sir,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox nods, “you can get me one of the tracking implants,” he says.<br />
<br />
“You mean, the devices you created, but had not the opportunity to actually implant one since every Animal in the Zoo already has a tracker?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox nods, “correct, I doubt this Cub has a tracker,” he says, “I already talked with the boss, and he is all for it.”<br />
<br />
Tina nods and gets the tiny device, not bigger than a penny, and puts it next to the syringes, “how can such a tiny object be of any help,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox turns to face her, a grin on his face, “this device allows the animal to not have to need a bulky and uncomfortable collar around it&#39;s neck,” he explains, “it has a extreme high tracking range. The Cub can be in India and we could still track it&#39;s every movement from the US, the device can be synced with any computer, laptop, tablet and mobile phone... that is the theory.”<br />
<br />
Tina&#39;s eyes widen, “wow, then let&#39;s hope it really works,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Only one way to find out,” Mr. Fox says, looking over at the “Cub”, who continues to sleep peacefully. “First, I need to get it vaccinated and do the other tests before I can surgically implant the tracker. So, let&#39;s get started, we don&#39;t have all day.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox first cuts away the clothing, freeing the poor “animal” from the uncomfortable cloth and throws the pieces into a bin. Next he listens to the “animal&#39;s” heart and lungs, happy of not hearing anything serious, he decides to take some blood next. After extracting some of the “Tiger&#39;s” blood, and while the analysis of the blood are processing, Mr. Fox starts to inject the vaccines into the cub. The vaccines are against rabies, fleas and other parasites and other animal diseases, unaware that he is actually injecting and examining a human boy.<br />
<br />
After injecting the Vaccines, Mr. Fox checks on the analysis of the blood, “still an hour to complete,” he says. He looks at his watch, “I guess we deserve a break,” he says, “the Cub can stay where it is, the machine will keep it asleep.” So, Tina and Mr. Fox leave the room to take a lunch break and discuss the situation.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox and Tina are sitting in the canteen, the Vet is deep in thought, which Tina notices, “what are you thinking about, sir?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox looks up at his Assistant, “oh, just thinking how powerful that Chronivac thing is,” he says, “how can a scientist group create such a device which is able to mess up lives?”<br />
<br />
Tina nods, “it is really scary,” she says, “that poor Cub, those evil people, whoever they are, really caused harm to it.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox nods, “a device like that should not be in the hands of evil people,” he says, “one can see what damage it causes. But in the right hands, it might be a huge help, but who can tell who is evil or good?”<br />
<br />
Tina nods and sighs, then she smiles, “well, at least the Cub is safe now,” she says, “but the only issue is, they altered the Cub&#39;s body to look human, how can we revert that?”<br />
<br />
The Vet is silent for a while, “well, I actually have the App-Version of the Chronivac on my phone,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tina widens her eyes, “why, sir?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox blushes, “I... um... was thinking about turning myself into a anthropomorphic Fox,” he says awkwardly, “I... I just think it&#39;ll suit me since my last name is “Fox”.”<br />
<br />
Tina tilts her head, she then smiles, “I think you should,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox looks at her, “why?”<br />
<br />
Now it is Tina who blushes, “well... um... I think y-you&#39;d look really handsome,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox raises an eyebrow then chuckles, “hmm... okay, for you I&#39;ll do it.”<br />
<br />
Tina blushes more, she always thought Mr. Fox was a handsome man, but she also knows that he would not want a woman in her mid 20s since he is already in his 30s. “Y-you don&#39;t have to,” she says, “it... it is just that... I kinda like Foxes.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox smiles, “Tina,” he says, “I know for a while now that you seem to be attracted to me.”<br />
<br />
Tina&#39;s eyes widen, “h-how?”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox laughs, “easy, the way you act around me, so nervous and the way you look at me, tells me you have a crush on me.”<br />
<br />
Tina&#39;s face, if possible, turns even redder, “I... I&#39;m sorry,” she says, turning her head away, “you must think I am some kind of slut who finds older men attractive. Besides, such a handsome man like you must be married and have family.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox lies a hand on the woman&#39;s should, causing her to turn and look at him, Mr. Fox is smiling when he says, “to be honest, Tina: you are a sexy woman and I am divorced since two years.”<br />
<br />
Tina looks at her boss in disbelieve, “I&#39;m sorry to hear that, sir,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox chuckles, “please call me Tom,” he says, “and you don&#39;t have to be sorry. My Ex-wife was... is a real evil witch. She does not even allow me to see my two sons, she even told them that I raped her and now they hate me.”<br />
<br />
Tina can&#39;t believe her ears, she even starts to cry, “how... how can she,” she sobs.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox wipes away a tear from her cheek, “I was waiting for the right woman to appear,” he whispers. He gently takes Tina&#39;s chin between his thumb and index and lifts her head up to look him in the eyes, “and you are perfect,” he says, “let us forget the past and create a wonderful life for us... together. What do you say?”<br />
<br />
Tina is unable to say anything, she can&#39;t believe that her boss is asking her to be his future, “ye-yes...,” she says.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox grins, “what do you mean with “yes”,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I want to create a family with you,” the woman bluntly states, then her eyes widen, “oops... that came out far to directly.”<br />
<br />
Tom chuckles, “I think I made the right choice,” he says and before Tina can react, he kisses her on the lips and sticks his tongue into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Tina is taken by surprise, but soon has her arms wrapped around Tom, her boss, kissing him back. They soon break the kiss and Tina giggles, “who would have known that I&#39;d end up with a Fox,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Tom grins, “well... I never would have thought to end up with such a sexy Vixen,” he says with a wink.<br />
<br />
Tina looks at Tom, “w-would you...,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Tom smiles, “if you want me to,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tina smiles, “let&#39;s both become anthropomorphic Foxes.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Fox grins, “I love that thought,” he says, “but we need to keep our relationship secret from the big guy,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tina nods, “I understand, babe,” she says.<br />
<br />
Tom smiles, “come, let&#39;s get back to the Cub,” he says, “the analysis should be finished, then we can start the surgery and revert what those people have done to it,” so they grab their stuff and head back inside.<br />
<br />
When they return, the analysis of the “Cub&#39;s” blood is completed, so Tom sits down at the Computer and checks the results. He scratches his head, “weird,” he says, “the DNA results are human, but the blood looks normal. The Cub has an AB blood type, which is totally normal.”<br />
<br />
Tina shakes her head in disbelief, “so, not only did the person alter the Cub&#39;s body, he or she also changed it&#39;s DNA,” she asks, “unbelievable.”<br />
<br />
Tom nods, “at least its blood is normal,” he says, he then gets up from his chair, “let&#39;s get the device implanted, then we&#39;ll revert the errors.”<br />
<br />
Jared is unaware of what is happening around him, the boy continues to sleep blissfully while Tina prepares him for surgery.<br />
<br />
Tina covers the “Cub” with a surgical blanket, which covers the whole body of the “animal” except for a small area between the shoulder blades. Once prepped, Tom goes to work, he carefully cuts the skin of the boy down to the bone. He then peels the skin back and with a fine tool, inserts the tracker and secures it with tiny screws to the bone, then he sews the tiny wound back up.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s taken care of,” he says, “now, I&#39;d really like to sync the tracker with my phone, so that I can keep an eye on him.” Tom takes out his phone and opens a App, which is the tracking App, and holds it to the wound, his phone gives off a “ping” and Tom smiles when he sees the data. There is a map with a blinking blue spot and the exact location of the “Cub”, “works like a charm,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tina smiles, “I am so happy that your device works,” she says, wrapping an arm around him, “what now?”<br />
<br />
“Now, we&#39;ll restore him,” Tom says, opening his Chronivac App. He scan the “Cub” and after opening the file raises an eye brow and shakes his head, “these people really messed him up,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tina looks over Tom&#39;s shoulder at the phone, she sees that there seems to be a name, surname, address, information about family members... . The woman shakes her head in disbelieve, “poor Cub,” she says.<br />
<br />
Tom nods, “well, let&#39;s fix it shall we,” he says and starts to edit Jared&#39;s file, deleting everything which he finds unnecessary, this includes Jared&#39;s name, Address, Information about his family, his hobbies, his desires... everything gets deleted and replaces it with the basic Tiger instincts. Tom also deletes Jared&#39;s ability to talk as a human and instead changes it to basic Tiger noises. Next Tom moves to the body of the “Tiger” and starts to edit: Hands and Feet become paws, legs become digitigrade and “able to stand upright” is changed to “all fours”. Because Jeff made everyone see Jared as a Tiger, everyone sees a tail, muzzle, cat ears, sharp teeth and a muzzle with whiskers, even though this is not true. But since Tom has scanned the “Cub” he is surprised to see that instead of fur the App says “skin” and there is no mentioning of a tail, muzzle or any other cat-like appearance, “weird,” he says, then he shrugs, “well, better change that to,” so that is what he does. Before confirming the changes, Tom decides to set the transformation to be painless, not wanting the &quot;Cub&quot; to wake from the natcosis. Satisfied, Tom confirms the changes, which to his mind are the true informations. The App tells him it would take over eight hours until the changes are completed, “suits me well,” Tom says and he closes the App and turns to Tina, “I&#39;d need to stay here or leave my phone so that the program is able to make the changes.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you could leave your phone in your desk drawer,” the woman says, “your office is close enough.”<br />
<br />
Tom thinks for a while, “I&#39;d rather prefer staying here and keeping an eye on the Cub,” he says, “if anything should go wrong, I want to be able to stop the change before the Cub gets hurt.”<br />
<br />
Tina nods, “I understand,” she says, “well, I&#39;ll be heading home. I guess I&#39;ll see you in the morning?”<br />
<br />
Tom nods and smiles, “of course you will, my Vixen,” he says.<br />
<br />
Tina giggles, she wraps her arms around Tom, “don&#39;t stay up to late my Fox,” she says, they then kiss and bid each other a good night.</p>
