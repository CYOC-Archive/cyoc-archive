<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This story has become WAY longer than I expected :P</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Umm, it&#39;s kind of a long story...&quot; You avoid eye contact with Brooke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she looks at the clock. &quot;We&#39;ve got about 23 hours, guess you had better get started.&quot; You let out a sigh, twirling her phone in your hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Some of this might be confusing at first but just bear with me,&quot; you say. You grab one of the shirts you gave Brooke to wear as pajamas off the floor and put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, just keep in mind that I used time travel to get here. I showed up right as you were undoing my belt,&quot; you say. You start rubbing your wrists where the handcuffs dug into them. &quot;I only traveled back one day to get here. Probably about a day and an hour, give or take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you in my body then? Shouldn&#39;t you be in yours?&quot; She asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because once the 24 hours was up, we didn&#39;t switch back,&quot; you say with a slight tremble in your voice. She reaches into the dresser and puts on a pair of your boxers. <br />
<br />
&quot;I... You got pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod slowly. &quot;We were so horny that we both forgot to use a condom. Neither of us noticed until it... Your cum, started to leak out of me. That&#39;s why I made kind of a big deal out of you wearing one.&quot; Brooke nods understandingly. &quot;Had I gone back to before we swapped bodies, I could have landed in your body anyway, and then there would be two of me, one in my body and one in yours. And God knows what would have happened to the real you...&quot; Brooke just stands there, listening intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;So after we had sex that first time, I stayed up all night. I couldn&#39;t sleep, thinking I might be stuck in your body forever, since at that point we didn&#39;t know yet. The next morning we went back to the magic shop right when they opened. Mei, the shopkeeper - the one on the phone just now - had forgotten to mention the whole &#39;getting stuck forever if you get pregnant&#39; bit when I bought the necklaces. She explained how souls are kind of like jell-o. If they&#39;re removed from their original containers, they start to solidify after 36 hours. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a 24 hour limit on the necklaces, for safety. After 72 hours, they&#39;re not gelatinous any more, so they&#39;re stuck in the shape of their new container and can&#39;t be moved to another container... Another body, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve been out of your body for over a day already?&quot; She asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm... Probably about 26 hours now. As I&#39;ve perceived it, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So your soul starts to solidify in 10 hours? What happens then?&quot; She asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly what happens when it starts, Mei never told me actually. But she said on the phone as long as I&#39;m me again before the 72 hours are up I&#39;ll be fine, as long as I don&#39;t use the necklace or bracelets for a week after I&#39;m back in my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke sits on the bed with you and puts a hand on your knee. &quot;So what else happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That night, after we figured out we weren&#39;t swapping back, Mei came over with a whole bunch of stuff from the shop. But you were really adamant about wanting to keep the baby. I agreed to keep it because I didn&#39;t want to argue in front of Mei, and I thought we&#39;d still have a shot at getting our lives back. I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on, you didn&#39;t want to keep the baby?&quot; Brooke asked, sounding a bit shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we could have gotten our lives back I wouldn&#39;t have minded. But I didn&#39;t want to be the one to give birth, you know? I was scared enough thinking I&#39;d be in your body forever, but being a mommy too, I just... I&#39;m not ready for that. I could be a dad, I think, maybe, but not a mom.&quot; You shake your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think I understand,&quot; she says, rubbing your knee gently. &quot;But what about the stuff that she had, didn&#39;t you try any of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There were only like 4 things that could have helped us and let us keep the baby. 3 of them were way too dangerous though. One of them caused depression in its users, one was a remote that made you addicted to controlling peoples bodies and minds, and the other had a risk of putting your soul into the baby&#39;s body on accident instead of your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the last thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a body suit that would let the wearer transform themselves, and transform others by touching them. If you wore it, then transformed me, we might not have had a baby any more. But if I wore it, then transformed you, we both might have been pregnant. That would have been fine, ya know, I think I could have lived with being you forever and even being a mom, if it meant you got your body back. But the wearer also ages at half the normal speed. Meaning I would have to live twice as long as you...&quot; You could feel the tears welling up in your eyes as you lean your head on Brooke&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t want to live a day without you... And half my life without you, I couldn&#39;t, I...&quot; A tear rolls down your cheek. &quot;We got in a really big fight about it. So after you fell asleep I went back to the shop, and Mei gave me this watch straight out of Clockstoppers... And here I am...&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke takes the ponytail out of your hair and begins to stroke it gently. &quot;It&#39;s okay now,&quot; she says.  &quot;None of it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it did happen...&quot; You sniffle and wrap your arms around her. &quot;Mei told me on the phone that I didn&#39;t really time travel but I moved to a parallel reality that was only a day behind. We don&#39;t know what happened to the me from this time, if he&#39;s in my timeline now or if he was just erased from this one, or if the two souls just kind of merged... Now I can&#39;t help but think I might have killed a different version of me... All because I was too fucking horny and forgot a fucking condom...&quot; Another tear rolls down your cheek and your breath begins to tremble. Brooke puts her arms around you and holds you tight against her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... If you&#39;re not even in the same reality, how does Mei know about all this? She even has my phone number?&quot; Brooke asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave it to her the morning that we went back to the shop. I&#39;m not sure how she knows in this time... She&#39;s like 300 and some-odd years old and she&#39;s been practicing magic the whole time... I&#39;m learning not to ask any more,&quot; you say with a short laugh. Brooke gives a little grin and kisses your head softly.<br />
<br />
The two of you lie down on the bed, covering up in the blanket that smells like you. Brooke falls asleep relatively quickly, cuddling you from behind. You do your best to stay awake for a while, hoping not to have a repeat of the last time the two of you had sex. After almost an hour nothing happens, and you feel comfortable enough to fall asleep.<br />
<br />
You wake up at 9:21 A.M. You stretch out your arms to find that Brooke isn&#39;t in the bed with you. Sitting up and rubbing your eyes, you find that the bedroom door is open. You roll out of your bed, stretching your arms and legs. You walk over to the dresser and put on a pair of Brooke&#39;s panties after realizing you fell asleep without them.<br />
<br />
When you walk out into the hallway, you can smell fresh brewed coffee. Walking into the kitchen, you find Brooke leaning against the counter, waiting for the toaster to pop up. She&#39;s wearing a pair of your old gym shorts and a faded Metallica shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning beautiful,&quot; Brooke says with a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning handsome,&quot; you smirk. You walk up to her and put your arms around her, resting your head against her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; She asks, lightly rubbing your back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still don&#39;t feel great about that whole other me thing,&quot; you say. &quot;Otherwise I feel a lot better than I did this time yesterday. You know, today.&quot; You don&#39;t even have to look up at her to know that she smirked and rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be hitting your 36 hours any minute now, the way I figure it. I saved Mei&#39;s number so if anything bad happens when that starts we can call her,&quot; Brooke says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, aren&#39;t you just the sweetest little thing,&quot; you say playfully as you look up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Says the little one,&quot; she says, poking you in the stomach. You let out a little yelp and scrunch up your face, pretending to be mad at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for that you get to make my cup of coffee, butthead,&quot; you say as you stand on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but it&#39;ll cost you,&quot; she sticks out her tongue. You stand on your tip toes as she leans down and you kiss each other passionately, causing a swirl of butterflies in your stomach. Looking into each other&#39;s eyes as you pull away, you don&#39;t think you could be any happier than you are right now. The toaster pops up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta move if you want that coffee,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
You raise an eyebrow at her. &quot;I don&#39;t think so babe. I&#39;m obligated to fulfill any and all girlfriendly duties today, and number one on the list is bugging the ever-loving shit out of you,&quot; you say with a big toothy grin. Brooke exaggerates a sigh and an eye roll. Then you realize something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, when did you learn to raise your eyebrow?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, I don&#39;t know? Like ten years ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. Weird. You couldn&#39;t do that before,&quot; you say, looking slightly perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be one of those alternate timeline things, then,&quot; she shrugs. She walks awkwardly to the cupboard, with you still standing on her feet, and grabs your coffee mug. She looks down at you. &quot;You&#39;re really not gonna move?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh,&quot; you say, holding on to her even tighter.<br />
<br />
Brooke pours the coffee into the mug, maneuvering awkwardly with you to get the cream and sugar, your face pressed into her chest. She fixes the coffee for you and exaggerates another sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ready, but you have to let go to get it,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five more minutes,&quot; your voice is muffled by the shirt you&#39;ve buried your face into. Brooke blows a raspberry at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s the plan for today? Neither of us have work so it&#39;s pretty much whatever,&quot; she says. You respond with a shrug, refusing to remove your face from her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t get that far last time,&quot; you say. &quot;I had stayed up all night so I fell asleep after we got back from talking to Mei at the shop, and I didn&#39;t wake up until it was almost time to swap back.&quot; Brooke puts her hand on your forehead and pushes it back, making you look up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I always this annoying?&quot; She asks. You respond by nodding really fast and smiling big at her. Brooke laughs, &quot;Well then I must be doing something right.&quot;<br />
<br />
You step off her feet and take your coffee mug with both hands, blowing into the cup. Brooke turns around and butters her toast. You go and sit at the computer, and Brooke follows soon after, sitting on the couch closest to you. You raise the computer chair all the way up, swinging your feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I never thought I&#39;d enjoy being so short,&quot; you give her a sly smile and sip your coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, being tall is awesome!&quot; Brooke exclaims. You&#39;re surprised to hear her call you &quot;dude.&quot; &quot;I like not having to climb on the counters to reach stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I keep telling you babe, if you just wore those heels I like you wouldn&#39;t have that height issue,&quot; you say, taking another sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I keep telling you, you wouldn&#39;t be saying that if they were strapped to your feet all day,&quot; she says. &quot;As a matter of fact, why don&#39;t you wear them today? Since they&#39;ll actually fit you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a challenge,&quot; you raise an eyebrow at her. Brooke gets up and walks over to you, leaning down and putting her hands on the chair&#39;s armrests.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if it is?&quot; You look up at her, giving her an &#39;I dare you to dare me&#39; look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I accept your challenge,&quot; you say matter-of-factly. Brooke lets out a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so going to regret that,&quot; she says. She turns and walks down the hallway, into the bedroom. A few seconds later she emerges, holding the shoes in her hand. The shoes have are glossy black with a 3.5&quot; heel, a strap back and a peep toe, the heel being roughly half an inch wide. She sets them on your lap with a sinister grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t named your terms,&quot; you say, taking the shoes in your hands. Brooke looks at the clock and thinks for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. You have to wear them until 5:30 tonight, just about 8 hours,&quot; she says, sitting on the couch. &quot;You can only take them off to change your clothes, since you&#39;re still not dressed yet. Other than that, they have to stay on. If you take them off before 5:30, you have to give me another blowjob with the tongue ring,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if I win?&quot; You ask. Brooke laughs at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t,&quot; she says. &quot;If, IF you win, we can do anything you want,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done!&quot; You say as you stand up, holding the shoes. &quot;I&#39;ll go get changed right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun storming the castle!&quot; She waves. You stick out your tongue and head back into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
You close the door and toss the shoes on the bed. This will be too easy, you think to yourself. You strip down completely naked and start rummaging through Brooke&#39;s dresser. You find a black thong and matching bra, and toss them on the bed. You dig through her shirts and find a cute black low-cut top. It shows just a little midriff and will give a nice view of your cleavage. You might as well be a cock tease today, you think. You throw the shirt on the bed and lookb through the next drawer, deciding on a pair of denim booty shorts that you know are cut a little high and ride a little low.<br />
<br />
You step over to the bed and put the thong on first. Next the bra, and you realize you&#39;ve never had to put one on before. You&#39;ve seen Brooke put it on a few different ways, so you decide to take the easy way. You wrap it around you so that the hooks are in the front, and hook the rings on the loosest set. Then you force the bra around, putting the cups in the front. You put your arms through the straps and pull it up over your boobs, adjusting the straps so they lay flat. The hardest part is over now, you think.<br />
<br />
You throw the shirt on, amazed at how much of your chest you can see from this angle. Next you put the booty shorts on. You turn to inspect your ass in the mirror, smiling a little and feeling sufficiently slutty. Now, for the shoes. You sit on the bed and lift your right leg up, resting your ankle on your knee. You take the right shoe and open the back strap, then slip your foot in and tighten the strap over your heel as much as you can. You sit and admire it for a moment before setting your foot down. As your foot settles on the floor, that&#39;s when you realize this is going to be an interesting 8 hours. It feels like you&#39;re on your tip toes, unable to put your foot down. You lift your other foot and put that shoe on, and stand up.<br />
<br />
Standing isn&#39;t so bad, you think. This can&#39;t be as hard as Brooke thinks it is - and then you try to walk towards the door. You nearly fall forward, barely able to keep your balance. Leaning up against the wall, you think, oh shit.<br />
<br />
You open the door and slowly step into the hallway. Leaning against the right wall, you begin to make your way out into the living room. Brooke looks up from the couch, watching you attempt to walk down the hall. She covers her mouth, doing everything she can to keep from laughing. You glare at her, scrunching up your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got this,&quot; you say. You slowly tiptoe your way over to her and sit next to her on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe,&quot; she says, stifling a laugh. &quot;You look like a total slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was the whole point,&quot; you say, crossing your legs. &quot;I might as well tease you while I can.&quot; You turn your body and bring your legs up, laying your legs across her lap as you lean back on the arm rest. You roll your ankles around, showing off your feet. Brooke stares at them for a moment, and you can feel her cock growing hard against your calf. Brooke tries to discretely push it down with her hand, but the fabric of the gym shorts only causes it to grow harder even faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey no fair,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;I like feet now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; you say, nodding your head quickly with a smile. You lift your feet up, letting the tent in her shorts grow to full capacity. Then, you turn your foot and gently rub the tip of her cock through the shorts with the top of your shoe. Brooke lays her head back on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I hate you,&quot; she says facetiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; you say with a smirk. You sit up and bring your legs down, then scoot closer to Brooke. You bring one if your legs back up and straddle her, one knee on either side of her, her hard cock pressed directly into your crotch. You push out your breasts, grabbing her head and pushing it into your chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you so much,&quot; she says, her voice muffled by your boobs. You can feel her cock straining against you, begging for release already.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sucks, huh?&quot; You say. You take Brooke&#39;s face in your hands, making her look up at you. As you bring her in for a kiss, you begin to move your hips back and forth, rubbing your pussy against her fully erect cock through your clothes. <br />
<br />
Brooke moans softly, reaching down and firmly grabbing your ass with both hands. A shiver runs through your body as you feel your pussy beginning wetter. Wait, you think. If I really want to be a cock tease, now is the perfect time to stop. You muster all of your willpower and climb off her, sitting back down next to her. She looks at you, giving you a &quot;what the hell&quot; look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girlfriendly duty number 2, being a big old cock tease,&quot; you wink at her. &quot;Which really helps fulfill duty number 1, come to think of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You totally suck, you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I was there last night,&quot; you joke. Brooke puts her hand on your shoulder and pushes you onto the couch, and you can&#39;t help but laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s been over a day and a half for you now,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you feel anything different? I mean, everything&#39;s okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything&#39;s just fine,&quot; you say, sitting back up and leaning your head on her arm. &quot;I don&#39;t feel anything different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; she says. You look down to see she no longer has a hard on. &quot;Just let me know if anything changes, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be the first to know,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we have about 12 and a half hours to go,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;You don&#39;t get to just lie around the house to get out of the challenge that easily, we have to go do something... So what do you want to do today?&quot;</p>
