<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill paused in the middle of the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&quot; He whispered, pulling up his, or rather Willow&#39;s Facebook page, where he stared in horrified awe, at a outdated picture of Willow pressing her lips against an image of Ben 10...Who was drawn in such a way it looked as if the cartoon character was actually kissing her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck me&quot; Bill hissed as he felt the heat of embarassment fill his cheeks. That was it, this girl he was now was just immature as hell. If, by some terrible twist of fate that he was stuck as this girl for the rest of time, he was definitely going to give her life a crash course in emotional maturity. He shook his curly head in shame before looking back at the message that Eve had sent. What was that about her being &#39;old enough to watch the first episode of SNL&#39;?<br />
<br />
&quot;That must have been her wish, to be young again!&quot; Bill reasoned. Before now Bill was banking on it being one of two things; Either Eve was a dude that had somehow accidentally changed himself into a Iron Man 2 Scarlett Johansson clone, or an unpopular girl like Paige or...like he himself now was that somehow boosted herself into high school stardom. But did that mean that Eve had been a teacher? Or maybe a grandparent of a student? Why else would someone that old be in the school?<br />
<br />
*Anyway, sorry about earlier. I&#39;m not gonna lie that Joanna girl scares the hell out of me! I checked my schedule tomorrow and I&#39;ve got almost every class with her save for study hall in fourth period. Do you want to meet then? Because otherwise I won&#39;t be around at all. There&#39;s the big game at Highland Meadows tomorrow so I would very much like to get out of doing that before I get dumped on the bus with the other girls. Or do you wanna meet up like right now?*<br />
<br />
Bill looked at his phone&#39;s clock and winced, it was after 1am and despite Shermer being a pretty safe town...Willow didn&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license (despite being old enough to have one, another aspect of either her emotional immaturity or her parents/mom being far too overprotective) and he&#39;d have to walk wherever they decided to meet.<br />
<br />
As a currently sixteen year old girl, one that had been creeped out just by the short two block walk from the high school a few hours ago, the thought didn&#39;t appeal to Bill. The idea wouldn&#39;t even appeal to him if he was still in his original, eighteen year old male body and all he had to worry about then was getting beaten up by Big Jon, Rob Bolstrum or one of the other thugs that roamed around until who knew when. As a girl...A small, rather weak girl...<br />
<br />
Bill shuddered at the horrible possibilities that might occur.<br />
<br />
*Hello??* The messenger app pinged again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. Uhh...&quot; Bill tapped the text entry box and typed a quick One sec as he tabbed back to the main screen of Willow&#39;s cell phone. &quot;There&#39;s got to be a schedule here somewhere...&quot; The bottom heavy boy turned girl muttered, tapping the calendar app and, thankfully, hit paydirt on the first try. There, in the &#39;schedule&#39; tab of the app, was Willow&#39;s class schedule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, P.E. in first hour?&quot; He groaned. He wasn&#39;t looking forward to having to do jumping jacks or...Whatever girl&#39;s P.E. was right after getting to school. And despite how normal this body felt he wasn&#39;t really looking forward to all the strange movements it might make when doing all the strenous activity. Willow wasn&#39;t fat, but if his new butt felt THIS tight in those jeans he was wearing earlier AND in these loose fitting pajamas, he wasn&#39;t looking forward to how it looked in the short gym shorts. Or seeing Paige in them. The thought sent a shiver down Bill&#39;s spine as he looked over the rest of Willow&#39;s daily schedule.<br />
<br />
Second period was math class. Ugh. Third was English, but fourth period was actually study hall! But before he responded to Eve he decided to just get a leg up in case Murphy showed up swinging his laws around. Fifth period was art class (Willow&#39;s favorite, if the number of heart emojis surrounding it was any indication), with lunch right after, followed by a boring afternoon of Biology, World History and Earth Science. Well, at least he knew what to expect now.<br />
<br />
But it was great that Willow and Eve shared a study hall together! It worked out perfectly! They could just...Wait.<br />
<br />
Bill&#39;s silent elation turned into a frown of suspicion. It seemed almost TOO perfect. Was this the Stone&#39;s doing? He had no idea if the magic little rock was intelligent or alive, but being changed into a girl and retaining his memories? Having reality twisted to where this girl he now was, who had no business trying out for cheerleading being in the gym lobby only a short distance from Eve? If it wasn&#39;t just random chance and a simple, logic based re-arrangement of reality then the Stone might have been...<br />
<br />
It might have been trying to bait them. Bait them into what, Bill had no idea and no real evidence to base it on, but the idea chilled him to his core and he subconscious burrowed deeper into the heavy blankets on Willow&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
*You there??? Getting late...* The messenger app bleeped again, and Bill knew he had to make a choice. Either he could sneak out and meet with Eve now and try to change back, or he could risk either constant interruption, witnesses or whatever the Stone may have planned for them during study hall.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of thought and another impatient message from Eve, Bill decided to...<br />
<br />
Option 1: Meet with Eve now. Bill does his best to sneak out of the Strasserman home without his mother finding out and traveling across town in the middle of a chilly October night to meet with Eve and try to change back into himself.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Meet with Eve in the morning and take a chance at changing back at school. Despite all the potential risks of being discovered or potentially tricked by the Stone, it was safer to live Willow&#39;s life for a short while than go out at night.</p>
