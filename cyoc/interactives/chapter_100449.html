<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Author&#39;s note: &quot;Blackjack88&quot; and company have created an interesting, alternate universe take on Moon Lake with this story line, and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how things develop; especially between Eric, Julie, and Spencer. Hope they don&#39;t mind me playing along, because they&#39;re more than welcome to join in the &quot;main&quot; Moon Lake saga whenever they feel like it.—The Masked Writer}}<br />
<br />
As everyone finished desert at the weekly Anderson/Twist family dinner, Eric Anderson quickly asked if he could be excused to go finish his homework, an idea his older brother Nate quickly jumped on, despite the fact that he had already completed his BEFORE dinner.<br />
Not knowing otherwise, their parents agreed, leaving just them and the Twists around the dining room table.<br />
&quot;Ben, is your homework done?&quot; Samantha Twist asked her (adopted) son.<br />
&quot;Yes, because otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t be able to go out after we finished here,&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;Another hot date tonight?&quot; wondered Frances, knowing who it was their son would go see.<br />
&quot;So, when is Alex gonna pop the question and make an honest werewolf out of you?&quot; asked Samantha, eyeing her son carefully.<br />
&quot;I could just as easily propose to him,&quot; pointed out Ben, &quot;but neither of us are going to tie any knots until after at least high school graduation. Now if you will excuse me everyone, I do have a date with my boy tonight,&quot; he said with a smile, grabbing the backpack he would put his human clothes in before assuming his werewolf fursona to have a howling good time with Alex Ramsey.<br />
&quot;Good night son. Remember, curfew at 11 since tomorrow&#39;s a school day,&quot; said Frances, as he moved to leave out the Andersons&#39; back door, which would put him slightly closer to Alex&#39;s house the way the town was laid out.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least your son has a good head on his shoulders when it comes to romance and sex,&quot; commented Martha Anderson when it was just the adults still at the table, before she rose and started clearing the desert dishes. &quot;Nate seems to have two left paws when it comes to figuring out how to meet and keep a girlfriend, while Eric seems totally oblivious to the fact there&#39;s a lady warm for his form.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean Julie Stovall?&quot; asked Frances, to which Martha simply nodded, before going into the kitchen.<br />
 &quot;She must be seriously smitten with him to still be hopeful after all this time,&quot; observed Samantha.<br />
&quot;Well, even though I&#39;ve had <i>the talk</i> with both boys, I know Eric is still a virgin,&quot; added William Anderson. &quot;Nate&#39;s come home from a few of those wolf pack meetings smelling like an orgy, but there isn&#39;t anyone steady in his life, which is what I think he&#39;s actually looking for.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s really sweet,&quot; commented Frances, looking lovingly at her wife.<br />
&quot;Frances and I have been a committed couple since practically the moment we&#39;ve first met, which is why we got married as soon as it was actually legal in Washington state to do so. But that doesn&#39;t mean we ain&#39;t up for a little fun when the occasion arises,&quot; said Samantha, eyeing Martha as she came back into the dining room.<br />
&quot;You guys weren&#39;t thinking of starting without me, were you?&quot; asked Martha in a fake pout.<br />
&quot;Hell no,&quot; replied William, as he quickly grabbed his wife and pulled her into his lap while giving her a passionate kiss.<br />
When they finally broke the kiss, the Andersons saw the Twists coming out of their kitchen. &quot;We put the dishwasher on for you honey,&quot; said Frances, coming over to give Martha a kiss of her own.<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s go downstairs and really get this party going,&quot; suggested Samantha, reaching around Frances to give Martha&#39;s breasts a squeeze.<br />
Martha simply let out a small sigh of contentment as William got up and led the way to the basement.<br />
<br />
Passing the sectioned off area dedicated to laundry, William never bothered turning on any of the lights in the rec room within the basement, for all of them were weres who could see well in the dark.<br />
As he started taking off his shirt, William turned and saw that Samantha and Frances already had his wife undressed from the waist up, and were eagerly playing with her as Martha started unleashing her inner werevixen.<br />
With one of the Twists on either side of her, Martha&#39;s breasts started expanding and growing fur as Samantha and Frances played with the one on their &#39;side&#39;, while each lady was nuzzling Martha&#39;s neck, even as her ears started to drift up her head and assume their fox shape.<br />
Martha pulled down her skirt to free her rapidly growing bushy tail as she kicked off her shoes before they started hurting her paws.<br />
As if pre-planned, Martha turned and started kissing Samantha and began undressing the now furry werecat, as her fellow werecat paused only long enough to free herself from her confining human garments.<br />
Then Frances began working her way down to uncover Martha&#39;s now quite furry and wet vagina. With Martha now completely undressed and in anxious werevixen mode, Frances began eagerly lapping away at the cream leaking from her friend&#39;s hot pussy.<br />
<br />
William Anderson, now completely without human clothes and in his full werefox glory, began playing with his hard red rocket while the ladies continued to pleasure themselves.<br />
He had discovered, accepted, and even encouraged Martha&#39;s bi-side while they were still in college; which led to many pleasurable encounters between them and extra partners not only in the bedroom, but other, more adventurous places as well. <br />
Yet, while Martha would play with any woman (or women) that struck her fancy, she remained true to William as far as male companionship and sex was concerned; long before they moved to Moon Lake and became werefoxes together, forming an eternal life/mate bond.<br />
Now the three were-ladies were on the carpeted floor of the rec room in a classic daisy chain. Frances was enjoying the pleasures between Martha&#39;s legs, while Martha was eagerly lapping Samantha&#39;s cream as she drank deeply from her wife.<br />
William&#39;s tail wagged in eager anticipation of what was to come, despite the fact that he had never been able to talk the Twists into taking a walk on the bi-side and enjoy his nice hard penis. They didn&#39;t seem to mind lapping his leftovers from Martha&#39;s messy cunt afterwards, and he knew all three were on their respective were birth control pills, but the Twists were never willing to stray from their lesbianism; despite the fact Martha had regaled him with stories involving some of the &quot;toys&quot; Samantha and Frances used on themselves and his wife when in the privacy of the Twists&#39; house.<br />
<i>Oh well. One can hope,</i> he thought to himself, as William saw Frances motioning him to come forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s ready,&quot; said Frances, moving to start sucking on Martha&#39;s left breast while Samantha was tonguing his wife&#39;s right tit.<br />
&quot;You better hurry honey,&quot; moaned Martha, eyeing her husband&#39;s pulsating penis. &quot;I&#39;m so hot, wet, and horny that I might cum without you,&quot; she warned, even as Martha&#39;s hands were caressing each of the werecats servicing her.<br />
Wasting no time, William Anderson knelt down and drove his werefox cock deep into his wife, sinking the topknot well inside her even as the two werecats moved away to let their friends embrace.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; screamed Martha, pulling her husband as close to her as the laws of physics would allow, even as she wrapped her furry legs around her mate&#39;s body and urged him hopefully even further into her.<br />
William only managed a couple of more thrusts before he felt his red rocket twitching within his wife&#39;s eager vagina, its inner walls clutching his penis like a prized possession that they refused to release, which was a bit redundant in hindsight, considering that his topknot would ensure the Andersons stayed joined together for a while anyway.<br />
He felt his cock filling the insides of his wife&#39;s cunt with thick werefox semen, even as she bathed it within fresh pussy juice.<br />
<br />
As the bonded life/mates cuddled and kissed, William relished the feeling of Martha&#39;s fur rubbing against his, the hard nipples of her breasts poking against his chest, and looked forward to the fact that they would be going at it again soon.<br />
Wondering what happened to them while Martha nuzzled his neck, William turned his head and saw the Twists entwined in a sixty-nine position elsewhere on the rec room&#39;s carpeting.<br />
In between licking and moaning, William&#39;s keen werefox ears heard Samantha whisper to Frances, &quot;Next time, I get to eat Martha while you lick me.&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Whether or not Eric knew what the adults were doing in the basement, Nate was well aware of the weekly orgy in progress between his parents and the Twists.<br />
He didn&#39;t mind them having their fun, but he wanted some enjoyment of his own. The last pack meeting (and werewolf orgy) was weeks ago, and he was tired of taking matters into his own paws.<br />
With his younger brother secured within his own bedroom, Nate quickly locked his bedroom door and stripped off his clothes, before releasing the werewolf within him.<br />
Now taller and furrier, it was all Nate could do to climb out his bedroom window and scamper down what he called &quot;the escape tree&quot; outside his room.<br />
It wasn&#39;t even 8 pm yet, but Nate planned to be home well before his 11 pm curfew, thanks to the alarm set on the cellphone attached to the lanyard around his neck.<br />
Although he didn&#39;t have a steady girlfriend, Nate knew he had to have some sexual release soon, even if it was just another stray, chance encounter with a female member of his pack.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________<br />
AFTERWORD: DIMENSIONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
The &quot;Earth-1&quot; Anderson family&#39;s home doesn&#39;t have a basement, with the laundry room in a little space underneath the master bedroom on the first level of their two story house. The Andersons&#39; bedroom has a dirty clothes chute directly over the laundry room, although their kids have to carry their dirty clothes downstairs.<br />
The &quot;escape tree&quot; on that world is actually in front of <i>Eric&#39;s</i> window, for the boys are in the opposite bedrooms compared to their &quot;Earth-2&quot; counterparts, but Eric has never used or thought of it as such.<br />
Yet?<br />
The only recent new arrivals in Moon Lake 1.0 are Jen Decker (werecat) and her son Tad (werewolf). There is no Spencer Lawson (yet?) regardless of gender or were-species.<br />
Samantha and Frances Twist have and will continue to share plenty of intimate moments together with their sister <i>werecat</i> Martha Anderson on &quot;Earth-1&quot;, but William Anderson nor any other man has ever been a part of their fun.<br />
So while a &quot;foursome&quot; will never be a part of their lives in that dimension; it was fun exploring the possibilities between a werefox, a bi-werevixen, and two lesbian werecats here.—tmw.</p>
