<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">What Matt didn&#39;t realize was that him tickling Ben not only freed him but also woke him up. As he saw Matt hurrying towards the bathroom he -or to be more specific his instincts- immediately knew what was happening to him. And caveman Ben liked the idea of another caveman being there to give him proper company a whole better than just having a normal person staying with him. Or maybe, just maybe he was the normal one? He was a lot more muscular, stronger, and certainly able to survive under any circumstances, unlike that feeble Matt.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t a further concern for Ben now, especially since he had already lost a substantial portion of his former brainpower. Instead, he jumped up from the sofa with new found energy and walked towards the bathroom with a slight hunch.<br />
<br />
Ben spied on Matt through the door of the bathroom.  Inside Matt stood in front of the mirror, his back facing towards the Ben as he was examining the damage done.<br />
<br />
“Fuck; Fuck, no. Why did I do that?”  Matt said, angrier at himself than Ben right now. Even from the back, Ben could smell the nascent musk, the slowly growing wild hair…And that growing ass of a caveman.<br />
<br />
Even with his own primal and dimmed brainpower, Ben realised that Matt was too focused on himself to notice his presence for now and he got an idea. Perfect. He let a crooked smile appear on his face as he slowly prowled behind Matt.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Matt was still observing the disaster on his face, His hirsute face already covered is some scruffiness. His broadening nose, a small ridge over his eyebrows and the growing need to grunt and ook. “Fuck no, we need to sort this shit quick! God I can still smell him!”  <br />
<br />
Poor Matt, unaware that the caveman musk was starting to also come from his hairier by the minutes pits. Ben grunted, his friend needed to relax a little and well…His caveman instinct knew how to find a juicy meaty prey.<br />
<br />
He locked eyes with Ben’s rear. The caveman prowled, closer and closer… His large manhood dripping pre on the tilled floor and using his hunting instinct to be stealthy.<br />
<br />
“Why did I that…Ah!”  Matt grunted in surprise as Ben tore down his pants and underwear  like they were nothing….Naked from the waist now, Ben took a good whiff of Matt musk coming from his crack and balls. Hmm, he could smell the budding primal caveman in there.<br />
<br />
“Ben. The fuck you are doing! You ruined my pants, you dumb caveman! Oh God…”  Matt noticed how enthralled his friend was on his backside and potential smell from it. And God, Ben’s cock was spilling prehistoric precum on the floor like they were no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
“Gonna make you pretty…Matt. Like a pretty mate.”  Ben guffawed and licked his lips.<br />
<br />
“The fuck do you mean. Ah!” <br />
<br />
Before he could react, Ben pinned Matt against the sink and Ben looked in front of the mirror and his hands gripped the sink border. He would just have to….<br />
<br />
Ben spread Matt’s soon to be hairy ass and exposed his pucker and licked his lips again.<br />
<br />
Even if Matt couldn’t see it, he knew what was coming and tried to struggle. But well, the caveman Ben was way stronger than him.<br />
<br />
“BEN! Don’t you FUCKING Dare!”  Matt screamed, split between fury and desperation.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Me dare. And Matt gonna love it!”  Ben large primal tongue slide out of his mouth and the slimy appendage started licking the pucker of Matt:<br />
<br />
“No…Ben. Fuuuuuuckkk….”  Matt protest died down as the tongue slathered his rim with saliva and hit everything just right.<br />
<br />
“Ben knew you would say that”.  The caveman guffawed between two slurps of his rimjob.<br />
<br />
Matt knuckles whitened as he held the sink for dear life, not caring about what was happening as the pleasure coursed through his veins.<br />
<br />
He stared at his reflection, seeing his hairs sprouting like a wild, scruffiness covering will his chin wildly. He saw his broadening nose getting larger and larger, large and primal enough to smell his growing and muskier smell.  He could felt his armpit getting hairier and sweatier even as he stared back as his own soon to be primal face.<br />
<br />
“Oh…Damn…GoD….*Grunt* God…Go…oUH…ouh…”  Matt let himself being swept by the pleasure as his voice grew deeper, huskier as he felt his vocal chords tightening, getting stronger. He would have noticed how his moan and words seemed to follow a simian hooting pattern.<br />
<br />
Ben growled and hooted back, taking pleasure in turning his friend into a primal reeking human from the distant past. He could smell the musk inside the crack of Ben getting stronger, earthier, and more primal.<br />
<br />
With one lazy hand and between slurping tongues lashes, Ben explored Matt’s balls. He could feel them growing larger and larger like his. Almost Pomelos in size, churning with virility and yellowish caveman spunk, ready to seed so many wombs and ass if needed. They reeked of maleness and stink, and were covered in hairy fuzz that joined a very bushy and large treasure trail.<br />
<br />
“Oh…God…Fuck…Full…So Full…” Matt said his voice now deep and almost guttural. He looked back in the mirror. He was fully caveman by this point.  <br />
<br />
Matt could felt everything, from his strong trunk sized legs. <br />
To his hairy prehensile feet.<br />
To Ben still rimming him with his slimy tongue, his slathered pucker, his ass hairy full of<br />
musk and saliva as Ben’s grunts started sounding like sweet nothing of another age.<br />
<br />
His hairy nuts dangling from his large and drippy proudly hard cock, both of them<br />
Overworking, churning, as they send waves of primal pleasures of his brain and larges drop of<br />
pre on the tilled floor.<br />
<br />
His strong manly arms almost like they belonged to gorillas, which could shatter stone. His grip on the sink was strong and almost crackling it.<br />
<br />
His hairy and sticky torso, muscular and having a bit of gut. Looking primal, rough, and wild. With a treasure trail and defined muscle he never dreamed of.<br />
<br />
Finally there is his face, His face now simian. His large broadened nose and large forehead with a brow bone ridge worthy of a Neanderthal. His almost simian jaw….His scruffy unruly hair.<br />
<br />
He hooted and grunted…”Keep…Continue. Continue…MATE; Make…Goood….Me…Caveman”  <br />
<br />
Matt grunt and Ben grunt again in response. It sounds like a pure declaration of lust and bound coming from his best friend.<br />
<br />
Matt look at his primal, rugged face in the mirror. All doubts and fears, evaporated.  His gaze maybe a bit duller, but his body is burning with new vigour and fire. He managed to smirk between hoots, seeing his crooked, yellowish if tough teeth. He passed his large tongue over his scruffy lips. He smelled perfect. He was …a caveman.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t stop himself from letting a grunty moan before diving his nose inside his now musky forest of an armpit. It reeked sweat, savageness, masculinity and disgust.<br />
<br />
Perfection.<br />
<br />
And as if on cue, his mate’s large tongue hit his prost..prost…his weak spot. And Matt let a grunty moan and let his python of a cock spill his yellowish slimy cum everywhere. If Matt still cared, he would have realised he spilled far more than any man could.<br />
<br />
But he didn’t care; the now large caveman fell on his butt letting Ben catching him. The contact and mix of body odour were making him feel secure and happy. Why did he fight against this again?<br />
<br />
“Me happy….Ben.”<br />
<br />
“Told you. Matt. Cavemen better.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed…Me Dumb.”<br />
<br />
“Nah….Scared…Not Dumb…”<br />
<br />
<br />
As Ben soothed him, Matt the caveman was content sinking against Ben’s strong hairy chest as the other caveman lazily and passively traced fingers on his chest and teasing his nipples.<br />
<br />
“Me pretty mate…”</p>
