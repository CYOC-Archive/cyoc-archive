<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“The Sun Mage Part III, Return of the King,” Mason explained. “Are you familiar with it?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” she lied. She liked Mason so he was bound to show her the other two films eventually, snuggled together on his couch, so close and intimate. She’d love them when she saw them, but for now she had to pretend she was into dorky fantasy films like the one she was about to see.<br />
<br />
They got tickets and he bought her concession snacks. It may have only been movie popcorn and soda but it made her heart flutter at his gentlemanly gestures. They then sat down in theatre six and waited for the movie to start, chatting to each other while commercials and pre-show played. She loved every second of it, oh why had she waited so long, they were perfect for one another, if she’d just swallowed her nerves sooner...<br />
<br />
Eventually the film started and she had to quiet down and pay attention to the screen. Confusion hit her like a brick wall the second the film started and she tried her best to piece together what was going on while a deep gurgling started in her stomach. She couldn’t step out now. If she missed the opening then she’d become even more lost.<br />
<br />
A bunch of characters were at some other character’s funeral. It was kind of hard to feel any emotion when she didn’t know who any of them were. She scratched her hair in confusion and the colour began to change, shifting from red into a sort of blonde and red mixture. She also got just a little bit taller, shifting her body and blocking the view of the guy behind her a little who grumbled in annoyance and shifted a little so he could see over her head.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t surprised she didn’t know who the characters were, she’d only seen the earlier films once in the background of her apartment, she’d been piecing a project together while Donna watched it with one of her endless boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Things thankfully got a bit more exciting once the plot got moving, an epic fantasy fight was easier to follow. She watched characters studding monsters with arrows, slashing demons apart with swords, and being pushed back further into their fortress. She could remember that the griffon riders showed up, her dad was an avid fan of the films so he’d made her watch them as a father daughter bonding activity. She’d only seen the first two films once so it was a little hard to keep track of who was who.<br />
<br />
Her hair went from reddish blonde to just blonde as she watched and it got a lot straighter and manageable. She brushed some out of her eye as freckles began to dot her face and shoulders, her eyes changing from brown to a muddy blue.<br />
<br />
During a romantic scene between Princess Aurora and Drago she smiled, knowing how the story ended on their wedding. She’d read the books back in high school, they’d been a fun read and she’d reread the trilogy just before the first film came out, going to see it with her dad. He’d be upset she’d gone to see the movie without him but once he learned it was with her potential boyfriend he’d be over it.<br />
<br />
Her hair went from a darker blonde to a pale one, so faint it sometimes looked silvery under the right lighting. It wound itself into a braid that fell down her back and kept the locks out of her eyes. Her beautiful blue eyes. She had such a cute face suddenly with her height growing a little more and her breasts straining out against her bra, going up a cup size.<br />
<br />
She was grinning from ear to ear as Drago gave his rousing speech to the armies of the light. She’d had a crush on his character as a kid, The Sun Mage had been her favourite book series, it was still her favourite book series. How did she break it to Mason that she’d seen it last weekend? She just had to pretend it was her first time for his sake. They’d have to marathon the films for their next date and then come back. She needed to see the film like five times in theatres to be satisfied.<br />
<br />
Her braid got more intricate, the braids getting smaller and creeping up her scalp until they circled her head like a crown. Her blue eyes were now an icy colour that just screamed beautiful. Her waist was slim and toned with muscle, she got just a little taller, just shy of six foot, and skin gained a near glow to it like moonlight had kissed her skin and blessed her with beauty.<br />
<br />
Finally it was time for the wedding, the dark lord had been killed, the dead buried, the kingdom reclaimed, and Princess Aurora and Drago were getting married. She bounced in her seat, this was one of her favourite scenes in Fantasy period. Sure the book did it ten times better but that was expected. Oh she hoped to write a scene that good one day, when she published her own bestselling fantasy book to add to the piles upon piles of fantasy novels that lined her shelves. Dragons, magic, and good dark villain were all it took to get her invested, and best of all Mason liked fantasy too. EEEEE! As if he couldn’t get any more perfect. She’d tried not to tell him too much about the film before they saw it but she couldn’t help herself in every area. She’d only seen it every day since it released, even standing in line for the midnight premiere. She’d done it with every other film so why was this any different.<br />
<br />
Her clothes shifted, her entire outfit changing to match the clothing worn by Princess Aurora. She’d made it herself, who didn’t want to attend a premiere cosplaying as their favourite character in all of fiction ever. If only they allowed prop weapons inside the theatre.<br />
<br />
Credits rolled the lights came up and Mason turned towards her happily. “So what did you... uh...” he trailed.<br />
<br />
Where Janette had been at the start of the film was a woman so attractive it made his dick turn rock hard just looking at her. She was the spitting image of Princess Aurora, but not like the actress that played her. No, like how the books described her, every detail perfect, more than perfect even. Mason was at a loss for words, staring at the girl straight from his fantasies sitting next to him.<br />
<br />
“We have to marathon the other two and then come back,” Janette grinned while leaning towards him. “I never thought I’d ever find a guy who liked this stuff like I do. Oh I have so many series I need to recommend you, if you like this you’ll love The Widow’s Curse. I hear they’re selling the rights off right now, we could get a movie of it soon.”<br />
<br />
Every word she said made Mason blush harder, he stared at the beauty before him making plans for next time. He’d thought Janette was hot before but this was something else. This was a dream come true. She was smart, passionate, funny, into him, and now she looked just like fan art he used to pump his junk to except real. What had happened? He didn’t want to ask questions because this was too good to be true.<br />
<br />
Mid sentence he leaned over and planted his lips on hers while the final bits of the credits score swelled alongside Janette’s heart. She couldn’t have been happier if she tried.</p>
