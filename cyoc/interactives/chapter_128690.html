<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You feel like the best way to teach him to be more caring and considerate toward his son would be to put him in his son's shoes...literally.<br />
<br />
Selecting Matt's age on the remote you change the 26 to a 2, intending to make him a toddler.<br />
<br />
You had thought about making him the same age as Kevin but then decided to give him a bit of a break and let him be a year older than his son.<br />
<br />
Hitting the execute button you look up just in time to watch as Matt begins to shrink in age, all while still arguing with his wife in a voice that was quickly becoming high pitched and childlike. His clothes also changed with his regression eventually becoming a Pokémon t-shirt and a pair of shorts. As the last item came into existence you noticed the crotch area filling out and assumed he was now wearing a diaper underneath.<br />
<br />
When it finally finished Matt was a young innocent toddler looking up at his wife with crossed arms and a pouty face.<br />
<br />
It also quickly became apparent that the regression had changed the nature of their previous argument.<br />
<br />
"I don't understand why I can't have some of your milk too. I'm still your husband even if I am two years old, I deserve to have a go at the delicious liquid inside those breasts of yours just as much as Kevin" he stated firmly.<br />
<br />
"We've been over this Matt you're too old to be doing that for your age" Anne retorted with a huff, not enjoying her baby husband making a big scene in public like this.<br />
<br />
"Oh come on! Since I can't have sex with you at least let me have this" Matt pleaded angrily.<br />
<br />
"I let you have plenty of things Matt. I agreed not to try and potty train you and let you stay in diapers for the foreseeable future. I still can't believe you actually like using them" Anne replied with a shake of her head.<br />
<br />
"That's different" he replied with a blush hoping nobody heard that.<br />
<br />
He then quickly changed the subject back to the topic at hand, "Anyway I want a bottle of your breast milk and that's final!"<br />
<br />
"I said no Matt"<br />
<br />
Matt balled his fists and angrily stomped his foot, appearing very frustrated with her outright refusal.<br />
<br />
"Give it to me now. I want it, I want it, I want it!" he yelled his face turning red as he threw a tantrum.<br />
<br />
You found it ironic that in the span of a couple of minutes that Matt had gone from complaining about pumping breastmilk taking too much time to complaining about not being able to drink breast milk.<br />
<br />
Though that wasn't nearly as surprising as what happened next.<br />
<br />
Matt's loud shouting abruptly stopped and was swiftly replaced with grunting as the young toddler squatted down. Since you were watching the whole thing closely you noticed as the seat of his shorts began to push out, a massive bulge forming against the fabric.<br />
<br />
You were a bit stunned that he actually pooped himself in such a manner befitting his new age.<br />
<br />
Standing up straight after he finished Matt stuck his thumb in his mouth and began sucking on it. His angry expression from before had vanished and was replaced with a calm and content one. Looking up at his wife he saw her staring down at him with an unsurprised look.<br />
<br />
"You just made poo poo didn't you?"<br />
<br />
The two year old awkwardly nodded his head.<br />
<br />
"Well I guess I have to change your diaper now" Anne said with a sigh as she placed Kevin, who had by now calmed down, back in the stroller.<br />
<br />
She then grabbed the diaper bag out from underneath and led the young toddler by the hand over to the nearby women’s restroom, Matt having to waddle because of the huge load his shorts.<br />
<br />
You really wanted to see what happens next and decided to follow the family inside, thankful that having a feminine form granted you access to this most restricted of places. The moment you enter the bathroom you see Anne pulling down the fold out koala care changing table on the wall. Wasting no time you enter one of the empty stalls and carefully open the door a crack to peek through. You were just in time to watch as she lifted Matt up and laid him down on the table and began to undo his shorts.<br />
<br />
After unzipping his fly she yanked down his shorts to reveal a Pampers disposable diaper which with its white color really popped against his tan colored skin. Ripping open the tabs she pulled down the front to reveal a mountain sized brown turd resting in the seat. "My you really had to go this time didn't you Matt" she smirked as she eyed the size of his mess, "No wonder you were so cranky. But now that you made a big stinky I bet you feel all better now don't you" she teased her husband who actually smiled a little at the baby talk.<br />
<br />
Lifting up his legs Anne removed the soiled padding, wrapping it up in a neat bundle and setting it off to the side. Raising the toddler's legs once again she cleaned his bottom with baby wipes. Judging from the look on Matt's face he apparently loved having his wife wipe his dirty behind, relishing the baby treatment. Next, she sprinkled some baby powder on his crotch to get rid of any lingering smell of his poopie. Once that was done Anne opened the bag wider to reveal an open package of Pampers baby dry from which she pulled out a clean set of padding for her baby boy. Unfolding the diaper she slid it under his butt and taped up the sides before pulling his shorts back up and buttoning them.<br />
<br />
"You know while it’s still a bit of a hassle to have to take care of two babies I'm still glad you got hit with that regression virus Matt, you are so much easier to deal with at this age" she commented as she lifted Matt up off the changing table by his armpits and placed him in the empty seat of the stroller which you just now noticed had changed to accommodate two passengers. After strapping him in she gave her husband a pacifier to keep him happy while she put away the bag and threw away his smelly old used Pamper in a nearby trash can.<br />
<br />
"I still want milk from your breasts you know" Matt said from his seat as he sucked on the rubber nipple.<br />
<br />
"Fine, if you behave yourself then I'll make you a fresh bottle when we get home" Anne relented as she started pushing the stroller toward the door. Matt's face instantly brightened at her words and he licked his lips in anticipation of the sweet treat.<br />
<br />
While you thought Matt was still a bit of a jerk as a toddler it seemed that the situation was much better than when he was an adult.<br />
<br />
You then decide to...</p>
