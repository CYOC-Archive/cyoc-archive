<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick can&#39;t help but be a little hesitant on just snapping another picture of Emily, considering the unpredictability of the camera so far. <br />
&quot;Emily, look I obviously want to fix you, to return you to your proper form, but you saw yourself how random this thing is. What are the odds that it will do what we want it to do this time? Hell you might end up as an inanimate object again, as much as I want you back to normal at least right now you&#39;re sentient and human... even if you&#39;re, well, a little boy.&quot; <br />
Emily shakes her/his head, considering Rick&#39;s words. &quot;True, there are much worse things I could be right now but I don&#39;t want to be male and I don&#39;t want to be a child, Rick! I&#39;m actually a 25 year old woman, I&#39;m your girlfriend Rick! We have to fix this! Here, give me the camera.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily takes the camera and examines it carefully, eyebrows furrowed in concentration as she/he turns it around to examine every angle of the device. &quot;A-ha!&quot;, she/he suddenly exclaims in a boyish voice when she/he finds a detachable plastic lid on the side of the camera. <br />
&quot;What did you find there?&quot; Rick asks, getting excited as Emily unlatches the thin plastic covering, revealing an additional series of buttons. <br />
&quot;Not sure yet, let me have a look at this...&quot; Emily answers. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes Emily managed to ascertain these were undoubtedly some sort of additional settings of some sort. She/he obviously didn&#39;t know exactly what these settings did or exactly how to work them properly but she/he could reasonably assume that the button labeled &quot;RESTORE+&quot; would do what she/he wanted to do. <br />
Emily shows Rick the labeled button and smiles hopeful and confident this must be the solution she/he wanted and needed. Rick smiles back and watches as Emily presses the button. The camera makes an audible click and the little light turns from red to green, confirming it switched mode. <br />
<br />
Emily takes a deep breath, then turns the camera towards her/himself and takes a picture. A strong light flashes as usual and when Rick opens his eyes his hope of seeing his girlfriend back to normal are instantly snuffed. Standing in front of him was no longer a little boy, but a young MAN instead. This man that Emily now became looked to be about 20 years old, he was exactly Emily&#39;s height and he looked to be a grown up version of the kid she previously was. He had Emily&#39;s exact same green eyes and her same height but that is where the similarities stopped. The new man was a bit on the short side for a man (since he is Emily&#39;s height) but still he didn&#39;t look weak or effeminate at all, on the contrary he appeared to have an athletic build and a visible bulge under his dark blue slacks. Even through the loose fitting pants his manhood is apparent and it&#39;s certainly at least 12 inches long. His face is handsome and chiseled and his hair is blond and cut into a faded buzzcut. He is dressed in dark blue slacks, a white shirt and a red bowtie, similar to the outfit Emily had as a doll and a little boy previously. <br />
<br />
The man(Emily) realizes what happened and letting out a frustrated groan, she/he puts the camera down and goes to the mirror. &quot;Fuck!&quot; She/he grunts when she/he sees her/his reflection. &quot;This is so disappointing... Why? Why can&#39;t this damn camera just change me back to normal, why is it so hell bent on making me a fucking male every time??&quot; <br />
In frustration Emily feels and rubs her/his new face and notices a couple of strange things. First, she didn&#39;t really feel the skin as if it were her own, like it was synthetic almost... Secondly, when she tried to pinch a cheek she notices that the &quot;skin&quot; would stretch out a bit like rubber, then snap back in place when she let go of it. <br />
&quot;Rick, shit I think this might not be as it seems...&quot; She says in a deep manly voice as she begins to pull off the bowtie and unbutton the shirt. &quot;I think this might have actually worked and changed me back but for some reason I&#39;m in a sort of... skin suit or something. This is fake skin, Rick, come here help me look for a zipper or something to get me out of this thing!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick rushes over and helps Emily remove all her clothes, which was a bit awkward since now she appeared to be, for all intents and purposes, a naked buff man with a big veiny uncut cock. Keeping his calm he explored the apparent man&#39;s body all over in search of a zipper tab or any kind of opening but he could not find any. <br />
<br />
Emily did not want to give up though and she got an idea. She carefully grabbed the edges of the false skin(ending on the inner part of the lips) and pulled as hard as she could. It wasn&#39;t easy since the skin was covered in strong adhesive substance on the inside, but after a bit of grunting and pulling she managed to stretch the mouth opening enough to get her real head out through it. It now looked like a man with a crumpled up head had &quot;swallowed&quot; Emily up to her neck, which both her and Rick found to be kind of amusing. <br />
Rick helped Emily to stretch and peel the fake skin off of her torso leaving her normal female self emerge more and more. She was covered in a sticky substance that looked almost like thick sperm and Rick noticed it also smelled just like male spunk... When Emily pulled on the skin suit further she felt a long rubbery insert slowly come out of her vagina and as she pulled the skin further down her legs she could see that the insert was like a long ribbed dildo built into the inside of the suit, just where the outer penis was placed. She blushed a bit in thinking how perverse this whole thing was but she pushed the thought aside and concentrated on freeing her feet. When she finally stepped out of the crumpled bunch of smelly fake skin on the floor, she exhaled deeply in relief and smiled at her reflection in the mirror. <br />
Sure, she was sweaty and covered in what appeared to be semen all over her body and hair but she was relieved to be herself again! <br />
<br />
Emily wanted to hug Rick but when he backed away she understood that a shower might be in order!</p>
