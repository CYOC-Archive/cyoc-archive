<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait here,&quot; Skye instructed Scarlette. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Skye then began to walk down the hall and out of sight. Scarlette, still considerably shaken, leaned against the wall and waited for Skye to return from what ever she was planning. <br />
<br />
Someone walked passed her. A young woman with short blonde hair. Scarlette eyed the stranger, she looked to be normal but you never could tell. <br />
<br />
Another woman walked by and she clearly had been transformed. Her chest sported nine, enormous boobs. She had three legs, six arms and three head. She was quite the sight to behold. Walked with her was a man and what Scarlette would assume to be her partner. He had it all out on display. Hanging off of the man&#39;s crotch were about a dozen, 5-foot-long, prehensile penises. Scarlette stared on as the thoroughly transformed couple walked passed. <br />
<br />
Yet another, strange entity walked in front of Scarlette. Or, in this case, scuttled.  A giant hand was crawling down the hallway. Tne digets paid no attention to Scarlette as they passed by.<br />
<br />
The normal women form early passed by again. This time, she had been transformed. Her head had been removed. The girl was holding it in her hands as she continued to walk, headlessly to wherever she was headed.<br />
<br />
Skye finally returned. She still had her four arms and breasts. Her nipples were still eyes and her face was still occupied by a single, large mouth. Skye motioned for Scarlette to follow and she obeyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what was that at about?&quot; Scarlette questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I asked the bartender to do adjust my boobs. It&#39;s hard to walk with your vision constantly swaying back and forth. So, I drank a potion to make them a lot more firm.&quot; Skye quickly twirled around. &quot;See? Virtually no jiggling. Oh, and I also have my eyes an upgrade to be prepared for our next stop which is right over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sign above this door was a neon, capital &quot;E&quot; with all of the lines ending with arrows pointing to the right. Inside was a large machine with a human-sized hole on top.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Extension Machine. Step inside that hole and I&#39;ll show you what it does.&quot; <br />
<br />
Curiosity drive Scarlette on and she stepped into the machine. The hole was almost as deep as she was tall. She barely had enough room for her head to peak out above it. Skye did some fiddling with a control panel. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the rim of the hole contracted around Scarlette as if it was made out of elastic. The band tighted around her. Her head and shoulders were the only parts still showing. The machine began to hum and a strange sensation began to fill Scarlette.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... now I need you to wiggle yourself free,&quot; Skye instructed. <br />
<br />
Scarlette began to shake her upper body. It worked and she began to slide out. Her arms popped out of the machine and began to help in Scarlette&#39;s endeavor. Eventually, Scarlette&#39;s waist was free. The machine still hummed. She continued pulling and wiggling to get her legs out, but they weren&#39;t there. Below her waist was still more torso. Scarlette, a little stunned, kept pulling. She crawled with her hands, dragging her elongated body out of the peculiar machine. Scarlette had made her down onto the ground  before the finally felt the last bit of her new body slide out on its own and fall to the floor next to her. The humming machine fell silent.<br />
<br />
Scarlette gave her new tail an experimental flick. Scarlette&#39;s new, serpentine-esque  body was six meters long from the top of her head to the tip of her tail. She rolled her tail around, enjoying the new sensations and senceing her new muscles. &quot;You know,&quot; Scarlette said as she rotated herself into a standing position. &quot;One of my early childhood friends had a pet snake. This has been somewhat of a fantasy of mine. Thank you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome,&quot; Skye smiled. &quot;This is the least I could do after I caused such a panick attack earlier. Now,&quot; Skye continued as she did somemore fiddling with the machine. &quot;I think it&#39;s my turn.&quot; Skye walked over to the apparatuses business end and crawled in as she said: &quot;When I took that potion for my boobs, I also took one for my eyes. My eyes now have a super thick lens over then, essentially a shield. This is important because,  well, you&#39;ll see. <br />
<br />
The machine quietly started to hum again. Skye smiled as she began to wiggled herself out of the machine. Her breasts popped out and she could see again. They were followed by her second pair and then a third. Row after row of eye-nippled breasts came forth from the machine.  After twenty pairs of breasts, Skye was completely out of the machine and it fell silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooo!&quot; Skye squealed. &quot;This is better than I imagined.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you don&#39;t have any legs,&quot; Scarlette pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? Neither do you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I can slither. What do you do, shuffle?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. I&#39;ve had a body like this before. It was one of my favorites. I like sliding around on my boobs. But, I&#39;ve never done this with eye-nipples.&quot; Skye&#39;s attention suddenly shifted. &quot;Is that a Dani?&quot; Skye said as she inched over to the entrance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Skye. That&#39;s quite the body you&#39;ve gotten for yourself,&quot; said a feminine voice of the hallway. Scarlette slithered over to see who it was Skye was talking with. A women with black hair and cat ears stood, talking with Skye like a long, lost friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see you&#39;re wear your usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; The stranger Dani said. Dani&#39;s focus moved to Scarlette. &quot;And who is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my friend Scarlette. This is her first time here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, some fresh meat?&quot; Dani punctuated with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! Wanna help me show her the ropes of this machine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meh. Why not,&quot; Dani said, entering the room. &quot;Is this going to be a rotation or an extension?&quot; She questioned Skye as she clambered into the hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;A rotation.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the machine whirred to life for a third time and stopped a few seconds later. The elastic band retracted and a doorway slid open to let Dani exit the machine. Dani&#39; s upper body remained the same as it was before. But the area below her waist had changed immensely. A dozen legs were attached beneath Dani. Her 12 legs moved with a hypnotic coordination. Dani held a door close to Scarlette&#39;s face for her to inspect. Each of Dani&#39; s feet had five toes with the big toe in the center.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Skye&quot; Dani called out to her unusually shaped friend. &quot;I&#39;m going to change back, now. But after that, do you and Scarlette want to hang out in The Game Room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani stepped on the restoration pad for the Extension Room. The work, that the machine had done a few moments prior, was undone. Dani&#39;s many legs began to shift and group together, fusion together until there were only two. Her cat ears slid down the side of her head and sunk back into normal, human ears. Dani&#39;s hair started to lose its length. Her breast sank back into her chest. Her body lost its curves. Sure enough, Dani&#39;s junk swapped teams again as she became a he.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Scarlette&quot; Dani said with his normal, masculine voice. &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve properly met. I&#39;m Daniel, one of the many weirdos that use this place as a way to become what they truly want to be.&quot; Scarlette was slack-jawed. In hindsight, she should have known that there would be people like this at Asylum 137. She would never have pegged Dani for a Transvestite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Daniel said, loudly. &quot;I&#39;m going to tell Freeze what&#39;s what. I&#39;ll catch up with you in the game room.&quot; He left the Extension Room, leaving the snake-like bodies of Scarlette and Skye to decide what to do next.</p>
