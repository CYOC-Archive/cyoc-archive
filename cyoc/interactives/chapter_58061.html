<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny looked at her sister and then at the fox that was sitting next to her.  Her sister started to pull on jenny’s arm to get her to move, this woke the fox up and with sleepy eyes he looked at the two. Finally jenny got up pulling away from her sister she wiped the sand off her legs then started to walk away. The fox sat there starting to look really sad that jenny was leaving, jenny looked back at the fox and said “well are you coming or not?” with this the fox happily ran up next to jenny’s side. Jenny decided that if she was going to keep this fox it will need a name, her and her sister started to think of what to call it. They looked at it and tossed around some ideas. Finally jenny thought of the name shinx and thought that it fit the fox pretty well.<br />
<br />
She talked with her sister as they started to walk the way her sister came from. Jenny wondering where they were going asked her sister where she was leading them to. The little girl smiled and said that in her search for jenny she found a hidden cloud cave. With this jenny looked at her little sister with a questioning look and said “ a hidden cloud cave what is that?” her sister told her it was a cave that was in a cloud wall.  Even though there are a lot of clouds around here a cave in one of them is really rare to find. Even though her sister wanted to go in the cave she was too scared to go in alone.<br />
Jenny laughed about this and then they continued on their way. Every once and a while glancing at the sea of clouds and thinking this is the weirdest sight she has ever seen. And wished she knew more about this “one piece” world this is. And who this luffy guy is that needs to get the one piece.<br />
<br />
Finally they made it to the mouth of the cave. It looked really big from the outside. Wondering how they were supposed to see once they entered the cave. Her sister asked if she remembered her light dial? Jenny looked at her with a puzzled look her sister sighed and reached in to jenny’s bag and pulled out a shell. Jenny though “great a shell what good will that do us in the dark?”<br />
<br />
Her sister started to drag her in to the cave. As they got in the cave and it got dark her sister turned on the dial and gave it back to jenny and said “I am scared you lead”. Jenny looked at the shell in her hand and was wondering how it lit up like this. But started to walk straight through the cave. Lucky for jenny it did not have any forks in the road it just had some turns going downwards. Wondering what will happen if they run out of cloud to walk on picturing herself falling out of the cloud trying to get her wings to flap. Then she saw the end of the cave this surprised her as she was not expecting it to end. But piled around it were some crates. Walking up to one she notices that the top is off of it and sees a lot of different shells she remembered what her sister had said earlier about them being called dials. She grabbed one and pushed the center to activate it.<br />
<br />
Luckily she was not holding on that tight to it because a big shockwave came out of it and the shell flew out of her hands and slammed right against the ground creating a small indent in the ground. Looking at it she said that would have easily dislocated my arm had I been holding on to it. Scared but intrigued she grabbed another wondering what it could do.<br />
<br />
Being as careful as she can be with it she set it down picked up a small cloud rock and threw it at the button on the dial, it pushed the button. Jenny, her sister and shinx looking at it from a safer distance away found out that it was a recording telling that these dials where hidden hear long ago. He named off a couple. Jenny found out that the one she used earlier was called a reject dial and was really powerful.<br />
<br />
Then she heard that two where storage dials that had some spikes pointing out of it. That type of dial was able to hold things in it and keep them fresh. Inside them were two fruits called devil fruits. One fruit was called the Hito Hito fruit which has the ability to give someone human traits.  And then one other fruit. But the sound dropped to an in-audible level and she could not hear what the dial was saying, upon further inspection she found a crack on the dial which she guessed was the culprit.<br />
<br />
Looking through the crates to find the storage dials her hand was searching through the crate when a sharp pain struck her hand she jerked her hand out of the box and looked at it there was a small gash on her hand. After the pain subsided she carefully reached back in and pulled out the spike she cut her hand on knowing that it was one of the storage dials. Pulling it out she looked at it in the light and was amazed at its beauty. After she found it she looked for the second one.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes of carefully looking she pulls out the second dial. Opening them she sees two fruits pop out. Looking at them jenny and her sister decide to do rock paper scissors to decide who will eat a fruit first to see what they do.<br />
<br />
Not even looking at shinx, she walked over to one of the fruits and felt her tummy growl. Looking at jenny and her sister playing rock paper scissors then back at one of the fruits she licked her lips and bit in to it. By the time the others finished picking who would eat the fruit first they noticed that one was gone and shinx was close to where it had been. Wondering what will happen to shinx and which one her sister gets to eat she just watched.</p>
