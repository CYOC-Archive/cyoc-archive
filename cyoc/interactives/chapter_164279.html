<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I mean... I guess I want to be bigger?” Jace started,<br />
“Yes?” The Sundial whispered,<br />
“Well, not bigger in the sense of fatter or something, I mean... older, taller, musclier, you know. So I look... and feel manlier. Like, bigger in the places where it counts,”<br />
“I understand. I can give you this,”<br />
“You can!?” Jace said excitedly,<br />
“For the price of your sister. For she is your big sister, she must always be the bigger sibling.”<br />
“So you’re telling me, that if I want to have what I want, Blue has to be a little bigger too?”<br />
“Yes,”<br />
“We could both use a bit more muscle, I mean, she is one of the skinniest people I know so it could do her good,”<br />
“So you take my offer?” The Sundial whispered,<br />
“Yes, Sundial thing, I take your offer.”<br />
The sundial gave a faint blue glow for a second or two before returning to the normal grey colouring.<br />
“I’m glad to be of your service, Jace,” the sundial said, in a regular tone voice all around Jace’s head.<br />
<br />
The sundial stood dormant. Jace stood awkwardly in the stone room. He decided to step back into his room. He slid his bookcase back in front of the door. It scarped his wooden flooring but that didn’t bother him. He hopped himself into bed and managed to fall asleep.<br />
<br />
“Jace!” A familiar voice yelled to him, he woke up suddenly, rubbing his eyes, “Jace!!” It yelled again. He recognised that voice as his sister, Blue. She had called him to tell him that breakfast was ready. He hopped himself out of bed and walked over to his ladder. He climbed up, looking around he saw his sister, Blue making bacon and eggs. He climbed all the way out and over to her.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know you could wake up this early,” Blue joked,<br />
“I didn’t know you could cook?” Jace fired back, she punched him in the arm, “I’m gonna go brush my teeth, I’ll be out in a sec,”<br />
“Don’t be too long, food’s nearly done,”<br />
<br />
Jace walked into his bathroom, rubbing his eyes again, he looked into the mirror. He saw the usual amount of stubble on his dark skinned face. He took out his razor and shaved until it was all smooth. He brushed his teeth. As he was brushing. He remembered what happened the night before. He continued to brush as he looked into the mirror at himself. He checked his arms, his legs, his stomach, his back. Nothing had changed. ‘What a weird dream’ he wondered to himself. He noticed a purple shape just out of his pyjama shorts, ‘probably just a bruise’ he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
He left the bathroom and sat down at the couch with Blue as they watched TV. As Blue was making lunch, Jace looked her up and down, seeing if maybe she had changed at all,<br />
“Any reason you’re looking at my ass?” She said smugly,<br />
“H-Huh!?” He panicked,<br />
“Dude, it’s fine. You’re a teenager, I get it. I used to look at my best friend’s ass all the time. It’s a shame we fell out, you would’ve been a big fan of Casey.”<br />
“Oh... really?”<br />
“Yeah. We never dated or anything but we would always hang out together. I mean... we kissed like twice but it wasn’t like that.”<br />
“So... what you’re saying is that your ass is off limits for anyone but Casey?” Jace said, smugly,<br />
Blue blushed, she looked away from Jace and was quiet for a few seconds, “you know, Jace. You are too smart for your own good,”<br />
<br />
The day played out as normal, Jace had pretty much forgotten his dream by this point, shaking it off as just that. He played games, watched a movie with Blue. By the time it was 00:00, he felt rather sleepy so he headed down the ladder to his room in the basement and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day rolled around Jace woke up at 11am. He rolled out of bed and stood up tall, he stretched. He walked over to the ladder and made his way up. He wasn’t very awake yet so he walked to the bathroom to freshen up. He walked past Blue on his way. She didn’t look up from making her breakfast. He opened the door and slammed it shut by accident. He was too tired to say sorry. He looked into the mirror, “Huh?” He groaned, he looked at himself.<br />
<br />
He had what looked like an attempt at a moustache on his face, his chin was covered with thin black hairs. His hair was also bigger. He was confused, he brushed his hand over it, it was more than stubble, that was sure. He looked closer in the mirror. His arms, they were thicker. Not by a lot, but slightly thicker. Enough to nearly be too tight for his pyjama top. He pulled up his pyjama top and looked at his stomach. He saw the beginnings of abs forming. His legs were also the tiniest bit thicker. He turned sideways, his ass was ever more toned. He looked at his bulge. It was definitely more pronounced. He looked at his back, that purple bruise, it seemed to still be there. He pulled down his shorts to look at it. It wasn’t a bruise. It was some kind of symbol. It was purple and spread over the top of his ass. It wasn’t glowing or anything but it was there for sure. Jace looked at himself again, he was amazed at what he was seeing. He was muscular, and he looked older, though he probably just felt older.<br />
<br />
He walked out of the bathroom, he tried to act cool.<br />
<br />
“Did you even brush your teeth in there?” Blue asked him, “because it didn’t sound like it,”she turned around to Jace from where she was making her usual bacon and eggs. She looked at him, “I think you might need a haircut... and a shave...” she said, she went back to get the toast she made.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I do-” Jace heard his voice for the first time properly, he topped talking, his eyes were wide,<br />
“Sounds like someone hit puberty,” Blue joked, she laughed to herself,<br />
“Haha,” Jace forced out a laugh,<br />
“I remember when that happened to me. One day I was nothing, and the next I had tits, it’s weird how the human body works,” Blue said, she grabbed her boobs as she said that. They fell down. Blue had B cup boobs, he knew that because he remembered her talking about it. She wore a grey tank top most days, she wore jeans too. Sometimes she would wear a flannel top but it would always end up tied around his waist.<br />
“Trust me, dude,” Blue said, “even if you hate it, you’ll get used to it, and trust me. Girls like guys with a deeper voice. You also look a little taller than yesterday. Maybe you should start working out, then you’ll have all the ladies on you.”<br />
“Yeah I guess,” Jace said, semi-excitedly,<br />
“And you’re in one of the best ages,” she said, “you get to go from skinny little kid to a man. You get to a point where you stop growing, I mean, if I could I’d grow a little more. You can never have enough boobage,” she said and laughed. Jace laughed too, genuinely this time.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was relatively casual, nothing really happened other than them talking. Jace went down to his room. He snuck over to to the boxes of stuff they didn’t know where to put and grabbed a mirror. He placed it on his wall so he could look at himself. He spent a lot of the day flexing at himself, looking at his muscles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day rolled around, Jace had fallen asleep at his desk, in front of his computer. He realised he’d spent the rest of the night... you can probably guess...<br />
He stood up from his chair. He scratched his beard, and- wait his beard!<br />
He ran over to his mirror and looked in. The abnormal amount of hair on his face was replaced with way more. His beard was a little longer, there was more of it, and it was thicker. He looked at his arms. They were thicker all right. They must’ve been two thirds bigger than before. His legs were the same. They all pushed on his pyjama’s. He lifted his top up. He had no doubt about it, abs. His pecks were big and strong. He let go of his top. Realising that it was no a little too small for his body. But that wasn’t too big of a problem.<br />
<br />
He headed up his ladder, he heard them beginning to creak as he did, he was starting to get heavier from this muscle too. <br />
He walked into the kitchen and living area. He brushed past his sister and straight into the bathroom. He looked at himself in the bigger mirror. He was clearly bigger. His shoulders were wider too. His hair continued to get bigger. He was going to have to get a hair cut soon. He got his razor out and began to shave. As he shaved he got one of his signature no reason boners. As he did, he noticed how much longer and bigger it was. It was impressive. It died out as he finished shaving. He looked at himself again. He noticed how much bigger his feet were, too. Even his jawline was more mature. He made his way out of the bathroom and sat down, not making a big fuss of his changes. As he looked over at his sister, he noticed something.<br />
<br />
He looked at her ass. It was bigger. Her hips were a bit wider. Her thighs were bigger too. She wasn’t fat or anything, but it didn’t look like muscle. Maybe she’d be bigger as in thicker, with a bigger butt. But if her butt was bigger, wouldn’t that mean her...<br />
<br />
She turned around and placed the food on the table, she picked up on his stare,<br />
“So it’s not just me,” she said,<br />
“What?” He said, his voice was a little deeper again, less than before,<br />
“I thought my ass was bigger,” she said, “and look at these,” she said, she grabbed her boobs, they were definitely larger, “I must be a C now,”<br />
“Y-yeah,” Jace said, looking at his sister,<br />
“Isn’t it weird to you?” She said, looking at herself, “I mean you hit puberty, and I start gaining weight,”<br />
“Yeah... it is weird,” Jace lied,<br />
“You think this place is cursed. That’s my guess, probably why they gave it to us for free,” she chuckled to herself,<br />
<br />
They ate in silence, until Jace spoke, “do you actually think that this is weird?”<br />
“What?”<br />
“Do you think this is really weird, how we’re changing,”<br />
“Changing?” She said, “okay, hold on. I’m kidding. You’re just growing up, I mean you’re just growing at a faster rate than I expected.”<br />
“But what about you?”<br />
“I’m just eating too much. That’s it.”<br />
“Huh. Well I’m just making sure,” he forced out a little chuckle,<br />
“You feeling alright?”<br />
“Yeah, I’m fine, don’t worry,” he said,<br />
<br />
The day continued, Jace avoided Blue for the rest of the day, he didn’t know why but he didn’t like the idea of his sister finding out what he did. He couldn’t help himself from ignoring her for the rest of the day. As he layer in bed, he kept looking at that door behind his bookcase. He couldn’t sleep.<br />
He managed to fall asleep somehow.</p>
