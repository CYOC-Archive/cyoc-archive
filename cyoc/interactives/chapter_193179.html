<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No pants!... I can could do this.  Jasper thought as he tried holding it together.    Lying there on the changing table, he just closed his eyes and started sucking those plastic keys.  It wasn’t enough to settle him down, but it was helping.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s get going baby” Molly said.<br />
<br />
Jasper, on his feet, eyes closed, keys to his mouth, tried to walk.  It felt strange, as though he was unsure on his feet, he was not just waddling but almost falling.  Fortunately Molly had his hand.<br />
<br />
They stopped and he heard Molly washing her hands.<br />
<br />
“He’s just upset, his pants didn’t make it through the change.”<br />
<br />
“Might one of these help?”  Maria Schmidt replied.<br />
<br />
“Hum.  He hasn’t used one, looks like it’s worth a try.  Thanks.”<br />
<br />
Jasper was still just standing there trying to hold it together.  Eyes closed tears starting to drip from his eyes.<br />
<br />
Molly leaned down and unwrapped the Pacifier that she was given and carefully replaced the keys.  Jasper took to it happily and it seemed to enhance his comfort.<br />
<br />
Still lost in his own world as they were leaving the restaurant hand in hand, Jasper finally opened his eyes as they got to the front doors.  He caught the image of a woman and her baby toddling out the front door.  He never understood why a parent would dress her child in only a shirt and a diaper. <br />
<br />
“Mubby bbuuk” he mumbled through his pacifier as he pointed and pulled at Molly.<br />
<br />
Molly thought it adorable as she watched her husband acting so juvenile.  Then quickly the note of recognition in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jasper stopped and a look of shock and concerned hit his face at the same time.  He was that baby.  All this was too much for him, opening his mouth the pacifier, fell and swung from its tether and he began the cry. <br />
<br />
“Mommy has you baby” Molly said as she lifted him and carried him the rest of the way to the car and strapped him in settling him again with his pacifier.<br />
<br />
He whimpered all the way home.<br />
<br />
Molly’s breast ached all evening and by the time they got home her blouse need to be changed.  She finally figured it out.  <br />
<br />
Dragging Jasper into the house, she figured maybe it would be her turn for a strange kind of fun.<br />
<br />
She planted Jasper in front of the tv with a few infant toys.  And quickly change into a comfortable robe.<br />
<br />
She grabbed a book to read to him and returned.<br />
<br />
Sitting him on her lap, look at this book Jasper, “Do you want mommy to read to you?”<br />
<br />
Jasper nodded his head and after 10 minutes of reading.<br />
<br />
“Did you like that?”<br />
<br />
Jasper nodded again.<br />
<br />
Molly cradled Jasper in her arms and started to hum to him.  “Did you have fun playing today?”    <br />
<br />
Jasper closed his eyes, he thought for a moment and in spite of all its ups and downs, he nodded again.<br />
<br />
There he was feeling all safe and comfortable cradled in a warm comfortable spot.  It doesn’t feel much better than right now.<br />
<br />
Molly noticed that he hadn’t stopped suckling that pacifier since it went into his mouth.  It was time.  She opened he robe revealing her engorged breasts, pinching one of her nipples a small drip of milk trickled forth.  <br />
<br />
“Open your mouth baby.”<br />
<br />
Lying peacefully Jasper complied, suddenly he had his mouth on her nipple, “it’s just like that bottle baby.”  <br />
<br />
Jasper was confused, it was a bit weird. <br />
<br />
Do it for mommy, please.”<br />
<br />
At first he just licked the tip.  It had a pleasant taste.  Soon he had his mouth wrapped around the nipple properly and gave a little suck and got rewarded with a little jet of milk.  It was fun, so he tried again.  He thought about foreplay but, this was different, better, he wasn’t aroused, but this still felt good.  He sucked again but seemed to miss the spot he needed to get the milk to hit his mouth.  Soon he got it right and settled into a rhythm.  Mommy was rubbing his head…. mommy? and he was in heaven. He was cooing then felt himself drifting into a blissful state.<br />
<br />
Molly was enjoying this.  There was a closeness she felt.  It was approaching 7:30, given the dosing she would be coming down soon.  She would wait to explain things she had learned to Jasper, maybe in the morning. <br />
<br />
“That’s my baby.”  Molly cradled her boy his head held in the crook of one arm as he nursed. Eventually she stopped rubbing his head and shifted his body so he could nurse from the other side.  <br />
<br />
Not long after the switch, Jasper squirmed in his mommy&#39;s arms. Noticing this, Molly could only chuckle at how he had embraced his infantile roll.  She then moved her free hand to the back of his diaper. The padding was already wet after an evening of tv and dinner. Her baby soon lifted his bottom and began pushing a mess out into the padding as well. The warm mush spread quickly throughout the back of Jasper&#39;s diaper, filling the seat entirely and causing it to bulge outwards. The poopy mess stained the padding and caused the bulky garment to droop noticeably, leaving him in a very full diaper. As this was happening, Molly just smiled and returned to rubbed the back of Jasper&#39;s head gently. <br />
<br />
Jasper was either indifferent or completely oblivious to the accident he was having, even smiling as he continued to nurse while pooping his diaper. <br />
<br />
Molly found it fulfilling how content Jasper seemed with the steady of flow of milk relaxing him as he snuggled up close and suckled at her breast. <br />
<br />
For his part, Jasper was in absolute bliss as he suckled, cradled like an infant. He didn&#39;t notice his mommy&#39;s hand drift towards his diaper, far too comforted by the embrace to care. He felt so warm and safe, He hoped it never had to end. <br />
<br />
Once the mess had stopped spreading into the back of her baby&#39;s diaper, Molly once again pressed her hand against the diaper&#39;s seat to get an idea of how bad the accident had been. She chuckled as she realized just how big of a mess her big boy had made, his diaper having ballooned out slightly to fit it all inside. The soft, poopy mass squished as Molly pressed on it.  Molly hugged her stinky little guy.<br />
<br />
Jasper was so peaceful, that Molly wasn’t even sure he noticed when he finished nursing and repositioned him vertically for being burped.  He stir a bit as he spit up a small amount of milk then settled into a heavy slumber.<br />
<br />
Exhausted, Molly leaned back and despite the fetid mass clinging to Jasper’s bottom which lay upon her chest, crashed hard.</p>
