<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patterson and her aides withdrew behind a thick glass screen that overlooked the rocky cave. She watched eagerly as the ingenious formula started to work its magic.<br />
<br />
Already, the doctor’s clothes were starting to rip as sharp black spines developed along his back. There was also a growing bulge in his pants as the nub of a tail started to press outwards.<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins was horrified by the changes. He was sweating and shaking violently as he felt more alien growths sprouting from his body. He looked down at his hands as they shifted into bestial feet, each adorned with black razor-sharp claws. He also noticed that his skin had started to transform. In places it had become hard and cracked, while his body hairs had begun to fall out at an alarming rate.<br />
<br />
“PLEASE!” Jenkins yelled as he banged against the enclosure’s protective glass “don’t do this to nnghhhh… to me. What happened back in the Stables was an accident, I swear!”<br />
<br />
“That’s not what I heard” Patterson replied. “I heard that you stabbed your boss in the back and had the audacity to take her place. And now you are going to make up for your treachery by becoming the Zoo’s star exhibit which, in my opinion, is better than you deserve.”<br />
<br />
“You nnghh, you bitch!” Dr Jenkins was finding it hard to string sentences together as his internal organs started to expand and shift. His body had grown considerably since the start of the transformation, such that only a few shreds of his former clothes remained clinging to his sharp spines. His body had packed on more mass as his belly had become more barrel-shaped, while his neck and tail had also lengthened as more vertebrae were added to his skeleton.<br />
<br />
Soon the doctor was struggling to stay on two feet as his legs started to cramp from the strain of supporting his huge weight. His skin also continued to change as green reptilian scales quickly covered his body in a layer of impenetrable armour. <br />
<br />
Based on the changes so far, Jenkins now had a fairly good idea of what he was destined to become. “How is this possible? I can’t… nnnghhh… can’t become a fucking dragon!”<br />
<br />
“Oh doctor” Mrs Patterson replied “it’s already far too late to reverse any of this. And besides, saying that you’re turning into a dragon isn’t entirely accurate.” <br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins was confused about what she meant at first; that is until he felt a slight tingling in his manhood. He winced as he felt his cock and balls starting to withdraw between his legs. His eyes then widened when he felt a wide reptilian slit open up just under his tail. He shuddered as he felt his junk being sucked inside the new slit, never to be seen again. His skin readjusted to form a pronounced scaly mound around the new opening; leaving Jenkins with a fully-functioning draconic cloaca!<br />
<br />
This new part of his anatomy made Jenkins feel sick as feminine hormones surged through his changing body.  “Nnnghhh NO! You can’t do thisssss. Pleassssssse… not a fucking dragonessssssssssss!” Jenkins’ voice devolved into a series of angry hisses as the changes reached his voicebox.<br />
<br />
In fact, the process had started to accelerate now that Jenkins’ new female instincts had begun to take charge of the change. Pretty much everything beneath the man’s head was now fully draconic. Sharp black spines ran from head to tail, while his body had been fully-covered by tough green scales. He was now on all-fours following the adjustment of his hips and the change of his centre of balance. Overall he was shaping up to be a very large and imposing dragon.<br />
<br />
One of the last changes to occur was the growth of Jenkins’ new wings. The process was excruciating as two limbs stretched from his back, pulling skin with them as they grew. This skin soon formed a thick fleshy membrane as the developing wings started to unfurl. Soon Jenkins’ wings were complete, leaving his face as the last target for the transformation.<br />
<br />
Jenkins continued to let out moans and hisses of discomfort as his face started to push forward into a long draconic snout. The changing man’s ears and nostrils quickly devolved into simple holes, while his tongue lengthened and became forked inside his growing maw. His teeth also grew bigger and sharper, while his eyes also shifted, becoming yellow and black as they settled into their growing sockets. The changes finally concluded when a pair of straight black horns grew from the top of Jenkins’ skull, while smaller black frills decorated the sides and top of his head. <br />
<br />
After this the process was complete: Dr Jenkins was now a large green dragoness!<br />
<br />
“Bravo!” Mrs Patterson was pleased to see that the formula had worked exactly as planned. The woman smiled as the new dragoness looked around angrily. However, she quickly jumped when Jenkins unleashed a hot wave of fire straight towards her. She was relieved to find that the glass screen in front of her was indeed fireproof as promised; otherwise she would have been burnt to a crisp.<br />
<br />
This only angered Jenkins further. He, or rather she, was still reeling from the changes. She didn’t want to be stuck in this disgusting body forever! <br />
<br />
The dragoness looked up at Mrs Patterson threatening. Her attempt to unnerve the ghastly woman didn’t seem to have worked. She frantically looked for a way to escape but only saw the cold stone walls of the rocky arena. She desperately slammed her weight against the walls of the enclosure, but nothing seemed to budge. <br />
<br />
Patterson smiled as she watched this display, sensing the torment inside the doctor’s mind. “Aww don’t worry dear” she replied mockingly “I know you’re frustrated at the moment. Luckily I know how to make you feel better.” <br />
<br />
With that Mrs Patterson prepared for the next stage of Jenkins’ punishment…</p>
