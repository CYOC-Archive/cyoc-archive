<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four of you stop in mid stride, even ceasing the swinging of your tails. <br />
<br />
Oh right. You were being silly. You didn&#39;t have a Master or Mistress to serve yet. That was what the lottery or free for all was for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, will you be Master this year?&quot; You asked politely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was Master last year. And Trix was Mistress the year before that. The club by-laws say that unless no other options are available, you can&#39;t be Master and/or Mistress twice in a row.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Thank you.&quot; You said. <br />
<br />
There was a sparkle of light, and what appeared before you seemed to be a girl. But her skin was like polished marble, but moved like flesh. Also in spite of having the same of a girl, she lacked a belly button, or anything else, like a child&#39;s doll. She also had &#39;wings&#39; that were made of shimmering &#39;pieces&#39; of light rather than feathers. A orange immaterial ring float behind her head. Her eyes were solid blue, and her hair was solid gold. <br />
<br />
She also had a clipboard and pen in one hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;And where do you think you&#39;re going? The club sign-ups aren&#39;t over yet. So the transformation rooms aren&#39;t closed yet.&quot; She said in a musical voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me hall monitor, I was going to take the new butlers to the club household, and then return to the gym and my club sign up booth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While leaving the transformation room unattended for any NEW club members sent in the mean time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... That was an error on my part, as senior butler, the fault is mine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sorry about this, but the rules say I have to check for this kinda thing.&quot; She stood tall, even if she was actually floating several feet off the ground you had to look UP at her in spite of her being much shorter than you. &quot;Ahem. You all knew what your respective club was when you signed right? You did so of your own free will and not under duress? And the details of your transformation was explained in laymen terms, and no information you would&#39;ve considered vital BEFORE your change was kept from you?&quot; Her ethereal wings spread behind her, radiating a light beyond light, and you knew you couldn&#39;t lie to her even if you wanted to, anymore than a rock could &#39;fall&#39; up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Everyone present replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU TAKE THAT BACK GOBBO!&quot; You heard some lady shout. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Excuse me!&quot; The hall monitor floated to the end of the hallway where two club members had bumped into each other. <br />
<br />
One was a short stack female shape, naked, and with a deep green skin and black hair, and yellow eyes. Her nose and ears were long and pointed. Her fingers and toes ended in tiny black claws. Her teeth were hall fangs. And she gave off the smell of a mulch pile. <br />
<br />
She had that intellectual aloof look about her that you&#39;d seen from chess and programming clubs. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying yer stupid goblin club is ... grate-two-itous while we imps are around!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It pronounced &#39;gratuitous&#39;, gobbo. And gobbo research mad-science, imp club just cause chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the way you speak is stupid too!&quot; <br />
<br />
The other was a girl with bright red rubber skin with white hair and gold eyes. She also had tiny black horns, and a spaded tail. She had similar blacks claws to the goblins. Unlike the goblin, but like the hall monitor, you saw she had the shape of a girl, but like a doll would she lacked the physical traits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mie-Mie, the school board has recognized the goblin cultural rejection of bathrooms, but you are to wear diapers when in the halls or working with other sapient creatures.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mie-Mie cross her arms underneath her oversized breasts. &quot;Gobbo didn&#39;t mean to. Matter transporter blew circuit breaker, gobbo need go to supply closet.&quot; Mie-Mie pointed. &quot;Stupid imp get in gobbo&#39;s way!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not stupid! You&#39;re stupid!&quot; The imp stuck out her forked tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh imp real mature.&quot;<br />
<br />
The imp huffed and threw up her little hands. &quot;The whole reason I signed up to the imp club was so I wouldn&#39;t have to BE mature!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sasha, the right thing to do in these situations is not to escalate. And tell a teacher if you think Mie-Mie was rude to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Imps rude to every gobbo.&quot; Said Imi imp. <br />
<br />
The hall monitor noticed you were staring at her and turned to you and bowed mid-air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m Annie. I&#39;m part of the cherub club. The school board approved our application after the imp club tried to -burn down the school- as a prank.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha shrugged. &quot;Hey, we keep telling you! You&#39;re not mortals with spirits, you&#39;re immortal spirits in flesh suits. Who cares if you ditch those ridiculous sausage costumes a little early as long as it&#39;s fun?&quot; <br />
<br />
Anne frowned. &quot;And THAT is why the school board approved the cherub club. You don&#39;t rip butterflies out of their cocoons before their time, the least it helps is the butterflies.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why have an imp club at all?&quot; You asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;The imps are to keep the trouble makers the school can&#39;t expel for one reason or another in one place. Goblins are kept around because they keep raising school&#39;s the SAT scores.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SAT?!&quot; You blurt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, DUH! We&#39;re still a high school! Not some creepy transformation black market investing in human cattle or something! We just offer people more options for their future than most.&quot; Anne said humbly. <br />
<br />
You look at Tom. He shrugs. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re still a school club. We need to submit approval for events, keep the staff up to date on our activities, prove that we&#39;re not wasting the school&#39;s time. And that the club ISN&#39;T going to undermine our grades and home-life. <br />
<br />
&quot;We had one girl whose parents forced her to resign from the club because her parents are both very career driven and thought she wouldn&#39;t get anywhere in life.&quot; Tom said sadly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought the club made us being brainwashed cat servants normal,&quot; you asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Normal yes. Being a comic book artist isn&#39;t otherworldly, but it&#39;s not acceptable to a family of say race car drivers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have anything I need to know about being a servant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A domestic servant yes. But what if you need to do your Master&#39;s taxes? Do you know how to do that?&quot; <br />
<br />
You slowly shook your head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Having knowledge is one thing, actually applying it is another. That&#39;s the difference between memorization, and education.&quot;<br />
<br />
The A grey calico said, &quot;Our Master -OR- Mistress, we&#39;re not sexist. We accept brainwashed feline servants of both genders thank you very much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a turn of phrase Johnny,&quot; Tom said. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; You turned to see a short lass wearing way too much goth make up with a black hoodie and stripped skirt glared at you all. She had a black star tattoo on one hand. &quot;Is this where the imp club transformation and brain-rewriting room is?! The imp at the booth said she was too busying playing Legend of Leagues 3 on her handheld to bother showing me herself!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Megan,&quot; Anna sighed. &quot;Yes it is, you just-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take it from here Miss &#39;I&#39;m Too Good to Trap a Dog and Cat in a Bag And See If They&#39;ll Breed Puppy-Kittens&#39;.&quot; Sasha said swaggering up to the new girl. &quot;Yep! I&#39;m Sasha! You the baby bat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m not some noob goth shorty!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure sure, right this way,&quot; Sasha opened a door in your direction so you couldn&#39;t see what was inside. <br />
<br />
The goth didn&#39;t look that impressed. She leaned in. &quot;What&#39;s with this place?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha came up behind her. &quot;Look closer,&quot; she said. As the goth leaned a bit more, Sasha kicked her in the butt hard, sending her flying inside. Sasha slammed the door shut and closed a hook lock that hadn&#39;t been there before. <br />
<br />
Sasha pressed her back against the door grinning. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! WHAT THE DEAL? LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!&quot; The goth said, banging on the door. &quot;Huh? What do you girls want? Huh? EHEH! St-stop! STOP! I can&#39;t stand it! HEHEHEH! They&#39;re ticking! Too much tickling! HA HA HA!&quot; The goth&#39;s voice got younger and younger. Then snapped. &quot;Oh you&#39;re gonna get it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha covered her mouth as she sniggered. Punching and kicking was heard on the other side, by more giggling of other voices. <br />
<br />
A dull plastic knife stuck out between the door frame and undid the hook. And Sasha stepped away from the door. A new imp stepped out, her clothes burned away, now the same age and height as Sasha. You recognized the hairstyle and facial features of the goth girl. And the tattoo in the same place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the club new, LITTLE SISTER!&quot; Sasha grinned. &quot;What&#39;s yer name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Black Star.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha whacked her on the head. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean Milly!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Milly!&quot; Sasha took Milly&#39;s hand. &quot;Now let&#39;s get to the club house! We&#39;re gonna challenge our pet snakes to a live hamster eating contest!&quot; The two imps walked through the nearest wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Anna sighed and teleported away in pursuit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gobbo make herself scarce too! Nice to meet you!&quot; Mie-Mie bowed and hurried over, giving you a view of her big green rear. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY RUDY! You been assimilated yet?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You knew that voice. You felt a chill go down your spine. You slowly turned your head around like creaking wood. <br />
<br />
&quot;SIS&#39;?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey big brother!&quot; You were her senior by about twenty minutes after all. Twenty beautiful minutes away from her. <br />
<br />
By some curse of genetics she had the same orange hair and freckles as you. She grinned looking you up and down, zeroing in on you immediately in spite of your change in species. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH I MISSED IT!&quot; She snapped her fingers. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said you were going to join the gardening club!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I decided before actually signing that being a dryad wasn&#39;t for me. I mean, having to deal with rowdy satyrs every night? No thank you. So I thought, you might be lonely without me! So why not try the same club as you? Trix was confused what was keeping Tom from coming back and figure he was &#39;drawing things out again&#39;. So Trix gave me directions. Nice girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you signed up to the Hypno-Kitty Club?&quot; You said fearfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEP!&quot; She nodded proudly. &quot;I&#39;m gonna make a great brainwashed catgirl maid, or a brainwashed catgirl maid QUEEN, if I end up being the Mistress! Then I can spend the whole year giving you orders!&quot; <br />
 <br />
Oh sweet Bastet no! Even in your brainwashed bliss you couldn&#39;t escape the feeling of dread. She was a curse shadowing your every step! Even transformed and brainwashed you couldn&#39;t escape her!<br />
<br />
&quot;She can&#39;t do this can she?&quot; You begged Tom. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re a co-ed club. What? Did you think were divided into all butlers and all maids or something? We have butlers, maids, and nudist servitors all in the same club. We accept brainwashed feline anthro servants of all types.&quot; Tom admitted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoo-Hoo! Lead me on!&quot; She pointed dramatically. <br />
<br />
Well, it was FUN five minutes of total brainwashed bliss. <br />
<br />
The group returned to the transformation room. Your sister showed none of the fear or hesitation that the other guy had. <br />
<br />
And... she stripped down in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;SIS! ARE YOU INSANE?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My clothes are all gonna be destroyed anyway. Might as well donate these to charity or save them for next year if I did being a mindless brainwashed domestic servant isn&#39;t for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You hated it when she made sense. <br />
<br />
Like a servant should, she neatly folded her clothes. The others politely covered their eyes. Your sister skipped into the booth and it closed behind her. She gave &#39;ooohs&#39; and &#39;aaahs&#39; like she was at a fireworks show, the colors and sound radiating from inside. <br />
<br />
The transformation finished and the booth opened up. Your sister stepped out, with fur the same color as her red mop had been. Her chest, waist, and hips, now all exaggerated to anime character parody levels like Trix had been, rather than the stick figure your sister had been before. <br />
<br />
She was also still naked. <br />
<br />
Oh right. There was an option on the forum to be a NUDIST anthro cat brainwashed servant, though given how revealing Trix and Tom&#39;s outfits were to begin with, you weren&#39;t sure what the difference was other than taste. At least your sister now had fur on. <br />
<br />
You noted that her species of cat was an Egyptian Abyssinian. <br />
<br />
She smiled at you with the same ever-expanding colored-ring eyes as the rest of the maids and butlers had, and suddenly saluted, making her breasts wobble.  <br />
&quot;Brainwashed catgirl maid Mary ready to hear and obey!&quot;</p>
