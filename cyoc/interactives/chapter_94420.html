<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The thicket of hair on your father’s chest and gut starts becoming sparser as is his perennial stubble. His beer gut is slowly shrinking and the layer of bulky padding around his body is disappearing, leaving your dad looking leaner than you ever remember him. His muscle mass had not changed so far and so as the bulk disappeared he is left with a ripped muscular physique. As his second chin disappeared leaving him with a well-defined square jaw and angular features, he looks to be in his early thirties and he could probably pass for a male model.<br />
<br />
Your dad had been unaware of his changes so far but as he saw staring at him intently he looks at his own body and is incredulous at the changes that are occurring to him as he saw firm, lean muscle he hadn’t seen in years.<br />
<br />
“Will what’s happening here son?” he says looking up back at you.<br />
<br />
But by the time he is looking back at you, you are undergoing some remarkable changes of your own. Your frame continues stretching up as your limbs elongated and your trunk broadened out. Thick muscle starts piling on your lanky frame. Your pecs fill out and your back bursts into muscular growth, stretching your loose T-shirt to its limits. Your arms thicken as your biceps and triceps bloom into large chunks of muscle widening your T-shirt sleeves. Your forearms fill with lean, sinewy muscle.  Your thighs thicken as they pile on more muscle and your calves flare out. Your cotton shorts are now plastered onto your much larger thighs. Your feet and hands enlarge in front of your very eyes.<br />
<br />
Flabbergasted at the changes he is witnessing in himself and his eldest son your father tries to take stock of the situation.<br />
<br />
“You’d better get those clothes off. I’ll help you.”  He offers.<br />
<br />
He helps you yank the tightening T-shirt off the top of your head. But the head that emerged isn’t your usual one – your features are looking more defined and manly, as if they belong to a late teenager in college. Your usually goofy ears are now more in proportion with your larger head and your nose lengthens by a just a smidgen. Your jaw is broadening. Sandy brown stubble surfaces on your visage. You are actually looking handsome.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is going on? Son is that you?” you hear your father call at you.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I don’t knoW wHat’s haPPEning EXactly either!” You realise your voice is breaking and that it’s sounding deeper than usual.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get to a mirror” you state with some authority as your voice sounds deeper and manlier still. <br />
<br />
Your father moves to face the large full length mirror in the room. You waddle to the same mirror, your mobility constricted by the tight shorts you’re still wearing.<br />
<br />
Both of you looked disbelieving at your own altered reflections. In the mirror two men appeared to be standing side by side. One of them is in his early twenties with sandy blond hair and growing bigger in all dimensions by the second whilst the other seems to be in his late twenties with black hair and is continuously loosing mass.<br />
<br />
For a second you appear as if you could be fraternal twins, as you both look to be in your mid-twenties. You notice that at this age you actually look slightly taller than your father and a little broader as well.<br />
<br />
You successfully manage to wiggle out of your constricting shorts only to be left wearing your blue spotted boxers that thankfully had been rather roomy before the transformation. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden as you examined both your reflections you are now the older looking of the two. Bushy sandy coloured hair erupts all over your body, covering your chest and midsection like a forest, and thickening over your arms and legs. Your previously neat, thin eyebrows sprout out in a wiry, bushy mess. You also notice that your body is steadily piling on more weight – this time pure bulk. Your sizable arms and pecs are fast losing their definition under the onslaught as they become covered by a growing layer of flab. Your meaty pecs are actually starting to look like hairy moobs. And your flat midsection is growing more indistinct and pudgy as it starts protruding over your boxer’s waistline. Soon you are sporting your own hairy small beer gut this is steadily expanding much to your horror. Your hands continue to swell with bulk expanding into meaty paws and your fingers thicken into blunt, chunky sausages. Your feet broaden out further as they are padded with more bulk and flab. You now look to be beefy, bulky and in your early thirties.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile your dad is now fast losing muscle mass as the last vestiges of his body hair retreated into his skin. He is looking all the more gangly as his previously broad frame starts contracting in on itself. His tight meaty pecs are shrinking into a flat, skinny chest as his muscular thighs, arms and back wither down into a skinny frame. His once meaty hands shrink to smaller and skinnier proportions and his normally huge feet contract to a more average size, leaving the previously stretched socks look almost too large now. He starts losing height, feeling the room growing around him. Soon his build isn’t much different from your own scrawny teenaged body before the transformation had started. His features soften, as his jaw narrows ever so slightly, his nose becoming more graceful-looking and smaller.<br />
<br />
“JeEZ I look like I’m YOur age!” dad exclaimed. His voice is breaking and could’ve passed for that of a teen. He is right in that he is now looking like a teenager but you no longer really fit into that category yourself.<br />
<br />
You continue aging steadily as fine lines etched themselves on your face and callouses form on your meaty palms. You look on with helpless horror as you your hairline retreats from the temples, leaving you just an island of hair on your forehead. Your sandy brown hair also generally thins out. But what hair you lost from your scalp you are gaining elsewhere as your stubble thickens into a thick sandy beard and your body hair thickens even further making you almost more hirsute than your father had been.<br />
<br />
The transformations seem to be coming to a halt for both of you as your reflections stop changing. Staring back at you are the reflections of a sandy-haired father and a black-haired son that vaguely resemble each other. The father appears to be in his forties, tall at 6’2”, thickset and beefy with a husky built. His sandy brown hair appears receded at the forehead and he is very hirsute. His son seems to be in his mid-teens, 5’6” gangly with a slight build and with a full head of lustrous black hair. He appears rather baby-faced, with delicate features.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is this?!” you hear a teenaged version of your dad’s voice cry as he touches his now smooth face just to make sure his features are real and this wasn’t some sort of bad dream. “It’s like I’m 15 again!”<br />
<br />
Your dad then looks up at the thickset sandy-haired middle-aged giant standing next to him. He examines your tall, bulky and hirsute frame and your pudgy, aging, bearded face. He can still make out your features through all the changes but he cannot reconcile how that Sasquatch is actually his son.<br />
<br />
“Will is that really you?” your father asks incredulously in his new teenaged voice.<br />
<br />
“I guess so. But I certainly don’t look like it. I look really old, like I’m your age! I’m an adult and I’m huge!” you reply in your new rich baritone whilst making a double biceps pose. Your already bulky arms swell up further as your beefy biceps contract. The exertion also causes your slight moobs to jiggle and your beer belly to stick further out much to your consternation. You consciously try to suck your significant gut in, but it can go in only so much leaving a still noticeable bulge hanging over your waistline. “At least I’m no longer a scrawny teen though!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah you can say that again!” your dad said sadistically giving your belly a playful pat that causes it to jiggle and ripple further.<br />
<br />
“Hey what did you do that for?” you reply in an angry tone that sounded more menacing than you had intended. You steady your gut with your hands to stop it undulating.<br />
<br />
“I’m only joking around!” Your dad laughs, “I may be back to being a short and scrawny teen now but at least I’m finally not the one with the beer belly. I feel so light! And I can see my toes standing up for the first time in years!  Remember how long you had been calling me fat and teasing me that I need to go on a diet? It seems the shoe is on the other foot now!”<br />
<br />
You try to prove him wrong by peering forward at your feet. But he has a point – you have to lean considerably forward to see your feet because of your belly that is now impeding your view of them. When you finally see your new feet you just cannot believe how big they look as you wiggle your meaty toes in the socks.<br />
<br />
“And plus I’m enjoying having hair in the right places again! I’m no longer the balding Sasquatch, as you used to call me!” your dad sniggers grinning whilst clutching his thick head of black hair.<br />
<br />
You aren’t as lucky now as your hairline is greatly receded at the temples. You feel your crown in desperation and realise that you even have a sizable bald patch developing there as well. What hair has remained of your once healthy mane of sandy-brown hair is also sparser and duller. All the while your body is now covered with a coating of sandy body hair. Not even your father had been this hairy before.<br />
<br />
“We need to change back somehow! I’m back to being just a kid now and I’m not even legal! And you’re… you’re just wrong. You could pass for my brother. You’re old enough to be my dad now! It’s like we’ve swapped ages… I’m back to a teen and you’ve aged right through to middle-age! How am I going to do my job as an accountant? How will you go back to school?! No one will believe us! How the heck did this happen? Do you have any idea Will?”</p>
