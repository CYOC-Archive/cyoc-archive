<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I....I accept, just please...help.&quot; Isaac said then moaned once more as his curse continued to turn his body into an abomination of plant and man. Flora watched this, witnessing Isaac’s ball-fruit double in size, and his cock swell up proportional to them, and ejaculate even more syrup and even more knats swarmed the head of his cock. Isaac then fell down, but not to his knees, as his balls and cock were now large enough to support his body weight and he looked to Flora desperately trying to hold onto what little humanity he had left that was slowly being sucked away by fruit and cock.<br />
<br />
Flora nodded, and her expression was that of concern and a bit of surprise as she placed walked through the swarm of knats and placed a claw on the head of Isaac’s cock and he moaned and commented,&quot;Hmm....interesting indeed...&quot; Isaac then moaned again, but only syrup was produced from the his enormous dick. &quot;Yes, it seems stimulation does not accelerate the process, but it does excite you to the point of orgasm with just a mere touch.&quot; Flora said then she prodded at the tip of Isaac’s cock with one of her claws, and Isaac moaned loader and an even larger load of syrup was produced from his flaccid cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;P...Please...&quot; Isaac begged then Flora looked up at him and shouted,&quot;Hey, can you please let me feel this out?! In promised that I would cure you soon, but observing such an interesting anomaly is....well....astonishing for me as the guardian of plantlife.&quot; Isaac couldn’t do much to respond except watch as Flora lowered her head to Isaac’s tip and sniff at it. &quot;Hmm....sweet aroma....&quot; Flora says then she licks some of the syrup that had fallen on the ground and she perked up a bit then said,&quot;Oh my, no wonder the knats love you so much. Between the pheromones of the scent and the sweetness of the taste you’re practically a magnet for these things. Hm....yes, I must preserve this and see how it effects the environment, but for now a promise is a promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flora then walked right up to Isaac and he watched as she opened her mouth and exhaled a thick green mist. Soon Isaac felt tired, and no matter how much he wanted to stay awake, or how much his lust compelled him to keep his eyes opened he blacked out on the spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Isaac awoke later from his slumber and his body felt incredible foreign to him for some reason, and his body was coated in some sort of slimy substance that made everything feel sticky. It was difficult for Isaac to move at all, even opening his eyes was an impossible task it seemed, until he felt something long and wet stroke itself across his face. It wasn’t like Isaac could resist the object, so he accepted it and eventually he was able to open his eyes and when he did he saw Flora licking him, but for some reason she was huge compared to him now.<br />
<br />
Isaac stumbled over onto Flora’s hind legs and tail, startled by Flora’s sudden increase in stature and ignoring almost everything else, until he heard his voice as he screamed,&quot;AAAH!&quot; Isaac then paused as his voice wasn’t his own, it was that of a kid, or to be more accurate a toddler. Isaac began freaking out, looking in all directions frantically until Flora licked him again then said,&quot;Shhh....it’s alright, just calm down now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac paused as Flora had spoken to him in a language that he couldn’t recognize, but at the same time he understood it fluently. &quot;Huh...? What am I? How did you...?&quot; Isaac began then he paused when he heard the syllables and noticed the way his mouth moved naturally, and he spoke in the same language as Flora did. Flora then placed a claw over Isaac’s mouth and shushed him and she said,&quot;It’s alright....Isaac, or now it’s Zizir as translated into our native tongue, Draconic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zizir?....wait OUW native tongue?&quot; Isaac asked then blushed as his lack of teeth interfered with his ability to form words clearly then he stared at Flora with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zizir, you’re a dragon welp now, my welp, my lovely son.&quot; Flora said then she nuzzled Isaac’s muzzle before continuing to lick his body. Isaac, or Zizir looked at his body now and saw his lush green scales, his quadrupedal stance with four tiny little claws on each leg. Looking back Zizir saw tiny spike along his back, a tail with a leaf shaped spike on the end, and two tiny wings that were barely half of a foot. Then he looked up at Flora again, and recalling that she was just as tall as he was when they first met, but seeing her size to his now Zizir could only conclude that he was roughly around one and a half feet tall.<br />
<br />
Flora then licked Zizir&#39;s face again and he growled up at her angrily,&quot;Stop it! Stop it now please...erm....&quot; Zizir wasn’t quite sure what to refer to Flora now and she giggled at this and spoke as if she was talking to an infant,&quot;It’s Mama now Zizir, MA-MA.&quot; Zizir paused then he growled again and yapped back,&quot;Stop talking wike that! I’m not a damn baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
Flora then flicked Zizir on the nose and growled,&quot;Zizir! Don’t use language like that! You aren’t old enough yet by at least three hundred years! But, to just correct and justify this for you, you are an infant and you have the intellect of one your age too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow! Huh? What do you mean?! How do you even know that?!&quot; Zizir yapped then Flora smiled again and she nodded to him and asked,&quot;Well, should I explain what happened to you after you passed out? It will be quite interesting for you to hear I&#39;m sure, that is IF...you know repeat after me, MA-MA.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zizir paused at this then he let out a defeated sigh and said,&quot;P...Pwease teww me.....Mama.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flora smiled to Zizir and said,&quot;Good boy, but first...you’re hungry aren&#39;t you?&quot; Zizir paused shocked then Flora rolled over onto her side and revealed 8 watermelon sized scaled breasts all along her underside. &quot;What....h...how?&quot; Zizir asked then Flora giggled again and took Zizir in her claw and placed him up to the set of breasts closest to her head and smiled. &quot;All draconians breastfeed Zizir including both dragons and dragon-kin. However for us nature dragons it isn’t milk, but chlorophyll and it’s much sweeter than milk too.&quot; Flora explained and Zizir looked up at her and gulped and he asked,&quot;D...Do I...have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Flora gave Zizir a stern look and said,&quot;You won’t survive without nourishment, and without teeth you cannot consume solid foods, so this is your only option Zizir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zizir looked at her then he hesitantly opened then closed his muzzle around one of Flora’s teats, and he slowly began suckling. Zizir was really surprised at the taste of the chlorophyll flowing from Flora into him, and it wasn’t creamy, but it was certainly sweet. Feeling an increasing need to suckle his mother’s breasts, Zizir continued more willingly and he found himself almost clinging to her teat as he found himself wanting more and more by each time he suckled.<br />
<br />
Flora smiled as she nursed Zizir and said,&quot;Good boy, now listen while you feed.&quot; Zizir nodded still suckling Flora’s teat and she explained,&quot;When you passed out the spell I used removed your former human genetalia safely and it rooted itself into the ground. The syrup fertilizes the surrounding soil, and the fruit it produces is nice, large, and quite delicious if I do say so myself after I made sure it had been kept healthy. There’s also lots of nice mushrooms and fungi growing around your former penis because of the fertile soil, and it has become a tree, your special tree. As for you, well after you were detached I had to do something that would make sure that your penis wouldn’t reattach itself, and the only way I knew how was to turn you into an egg. While the experience was quite pleasurable for me, I will spare your young mind from the image of when you entered my womb. Either way you sat comfortably in me, and I was pregnant with you for a decade and after I layed you I warmed you for one month until you hatched today. So, happy hatchday my little one, we should celebrate with those who commonly visit, and aren’t corrupted such as you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zizir paused then looked up at her and asked,&quot;How did you know about my name? And overs? What overs?&quot; Flora paused to burp Zizir and she said,&quot; A few friends of mine, some former humans like you, and some who are creatures like me who made their sanctuaries or homes here. I also knew your name because of a small link between us, I don’t expect you to understand but it was made when you entered my womb. Are you finished feeding my son?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zizir paused then shook his head and Flora allowed him to continue suckling her breast. &quot;You&#39;re very hungry aren’t you? After this would you like to go outside of the cave into the sanctuary, and see your tree?&quot; Flora asked<br />
<br />
Zizir paused then he stopped suckling feeling quite full now and looked around to see that he was in a nest within a cave. The cave walls were all lined and supported by tree roots, and as Zizir saw the exit to the cave Flora patted him and he burped again. Zizir then looked at Flora and asked,&quot;Mama...what can I do with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....how about I start saying things, and you pick which one sounds best to you?&quot; Flora asked and Zizir nodded to her, and she began listing suggestions.</p>
