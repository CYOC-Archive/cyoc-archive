<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a barely used conference room at the Gazette, dozens of reporters stood around; a few fuming, others are looking at the door with a nervous look about them. Fearful of their competition beating them to the latest scoop revolving around the Frederick Parker saga. Yet all were upset that when Sheriff Cooper announced that he selected Lance Knight and his small local newspaper to act as a liaison; ensuring that Knight Media would be getting the exclusive reports well before everyone else.<br />
<br />
A few of the reporters with their camera crew decried censorship and suppressing the press. The sheriff in an ill mood made it clear that if they want to feel censored or suppressed, they were more than welcome to press the issue inside a jail cell. It wasn’t long afterwards that the roving mass of reporters started arriving at Moon Lake’s Gazette. Once there they were given strict instructions by security that they were not to go wandering about the place; the cards they were given would only give them access to the elevator and the floor in which the conference room was in. Another restriction was that all cameras and those operating them were not allowed in the building. A few balked at this condition and refused to participate; those were summarily denied entry. Those that didn’t kick up a fuss tried to be more circumspect with cameras and recording devices; a metal detector discovered those devices and the reporters that tried to use guile to get past them, as such they were also weeded out.<br />
<br />
With those that refused to play ball and the members of the press that were borderline tabloid reporters, the rest in the conference room waited as Lance Knight spoke. Listening as he named Ella the lead reporter that they would have to answer to. Those that came representing some of the more well-known news agencies recognized her name as the reporter that wrote that sizzling expose on Jack Crawford and his wife Kenya. That article all over the papers on the west coast of America, it was a forgone conclusion that it would soon be gracing the front pages of several east coast newspapers; thus complicating the problems that Jack Crawford would soon face.<br />
<br />
“Know we all know that Frederick,” Lance speaking to the congregation; “will pull through. Thank those that are not in this room,” Lance referring to the dregs of the reporters; “by now those working at the hospital are being reminded of their duty to keep patient information confidential. While I do not know who leaked Frederick’s condition,” Lance speaking; “rest assured that hole will be plugged by the head of the hospital.”<br />
“Who is the hospital head,” a reporter speaking.<br />
“Tora Tachibana,” Lance answering; “and before you ask, no the man is not available for interviews. And let me warn you hear and now,” Lance looking serious; “that his family, most importantly his grandmother are extremely protective of their privacy. Don’t go traipsing to the Tachibana Estate and expecting to not have a dozen security guards descend on you like a hawk on a tit mouse.”<br />
“Speaking from experience,” another reporting making notes for a potential side story.<br />
“Yes,” Lance lying; not revealing to the reporters that the Tachibana’s are were-foxes that tend to be in their fursona’s behind their walled compound.<br />
<br />
“If we are done with these tangents,” Ella chiming in; “can we get back to the issue regarding the dissemination of information regarding Frederick Parker?”<br />
Lance looks at his star reporter, noticing that she seems irritated on some matter; Lance makes it clear to talk to Ella about it afterwards.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Roughly thirty minutes later, as the last of the news reporters’ leaves the conference room, Ella sits down on a nearby chair; feeling exhausted as she kicked off her shoes. She was about to let her fursona out before a cough caught her attention.<br />
“Something wrong,” Lance staring at the woman.<br />
“Just stress,” Ella sighing; “I haven’t had a good run since last Thursday evening.”<br />
“Most of us are like that,” Lance grabbing a chair and sitting next to Ella; “the were-alert does tend to stymie such outdoor activities.”<br />
“A few of the reporters we just talked to,” Ella pausing to breathe in and exhale; “they approached me asking if I’ve made a decision to leave the gazette. You know the offers I got after the Crawford Expose,” Ella adding.<br />
“I remember you mentioning about those this morning,” Lance nodding; “have you made a decision?”<br />
“Yeah,” Ella sighing; “I’m not taking them. I want to stay here.”<br />
“Alright,” Lance sighing silently in joy; “How do you intend to let the competition know?”<br />
“I’m not,” Ella responding; “I’m going to ignore those emails.”<br />
“I wouldn’t do that,” Lance getting up; “you would be burning your bridges with those places. And here in the reporting world, that is a big no-no.”<br />
“Then what should I do,” Ella looking at Lance as he gathers some documents on the table.<br />
“Send a email,” Lance answering; “politely declining the offer for the time being. State at this time you are not interested in leaving town or family, but due ask that the offer still be kept open in case you want a change of pace.”<br />
“Will that work,” Ella getting up to help Lance collect documents and notes.<br />
“Yes,” Lance answering with a smile; “but don’t be surprised if a few of the big named papers like The Post, Times, Tribune and the Herald are a bit more persistent. Upping the offer with a signing bonus or a few other juicy perks,” Lance sighing; “perks that I can’t provide.”<br />
“Like a staff car,” Ella chuckling; “an organization call Sun Media offered one for me if I joined them.”<br />
“Sun media,” Lance looking surprised; “that is in Canada. Which city desk would they have you work at?”<br />
“They said my choice,” Ella answering indifferently; “It doesn’t matter, I’m not going anyway.”<br />
<br />
Lance nodded as he and Ella headed to the elevator back up to the bull pen; with their security cards granting them access. A short ride later they were in the now nearly empty office space; save for a few people finishing up their stories for tomorrows edition. Entering Lance’s office, Ella watches as Lance places the notes on his desk before sitting down.<br />
<br />
Going back to your earlier comment,” Lance looking thoughtful; “the one in not having a good run in a while. You’re not the only one suffering from that,” Lance looking crestfallen.<br />
“I know,” Ella sitting down; “the whole were-community is suffering. My husband is starting to go squirrely with having to keep his fur indoors. He has started getting more,” Ella hesitates; “more amorous of late.”<br />
“I can imagine,” Lance nodding; “sex is currently our only outlet to expel excess energy. I wouldn’t be surprised if several couples walk away from this with a baby on the way,” Lance chuckling; “Moon Lake is going to have a small population boost from this were-alert.”<br />
“So how are you expending your excess energy,” Ella smirking; “what with Lila pregnant.”<br />
Lance grins as he turns his attention to his computer; “why don’t you head home now Ella. We’ll pick up managing the press tomorrow.”</p>
