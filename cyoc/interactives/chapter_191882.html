<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Heheh, don&#39;t be too upset now. You may not like wearing diapers, but we&#39;ll be sure to change you often.&quot; The client laughed as he force-fed Selina one pill after another.<br />
<br />
Selina became a younger teenager, then her clothes fell off as she was reduced to elementary-school age. She was light enough now to be easily held up in the air by a single henchman. Another pill was fed to her and her unclothed body became even smaller and daintier in the arms of the man holding her.<br />
<br />
One pill after another, until Selina was at last a one-year-old. The client laid her down on the rug and put her in a diaper. Selina was beyond furious at this humiliation. She had spent years fantasizing about becoming an adult again and getting revenge on this man...and here she is, reduced back to a baby and completely at his mercy. Selina was put in a pink onesie, a frilly lilac dress and little booties with bunny-ears. Selina blushed--she had to admit her outfit was adorable.<br />
<br />
Later that night, spending time in her client&#39;s nursery, Selina found herself in a bind. She didn&#39;t want to use her diaper. She really, REALLY did not want to. She practically had PTSD from her last regression; being forced to use them for over two years. The thought of doing it all over again was unbearable. She didn&#39;t technically need the diapers. Last time, she was able to control her bladder and bowels at around 9 months old, thanks to her adult intelligence. But she didn&#39;t want to stand out compared to other babies, and so literally gritted her teeth and kept doing her business in her underwear almost two years longer than she had to.<br />
<br />
Now on her third infancy, she&#39;d really like to avoid this. Maybe her client could show her some lenience and give her a toddler potty. But what if not? What if merely asking that incurs a heavier punishment upon her, greater than the embarrassment she&#39;s already coping with.<br />
<br />
In that instant, a caretaker came into the nursery. Reflexively aware that her diaper would be checked soon, Selina decided to avoid drawing attention to herself, and so decided it was time to use the diaper right now. She stood up and spread her legs. Crying a little, her miniscule bladder relaxed and soaked up her little diaper. Being changed by the caretaker a minute later, she soon realized something...<br />
<br />
...these caretakers don&#39;t know about her true age! The one changing her is cooing and making baby talk like one would to an actual baby, with no awareness at all. Now this is something she could play to her advantage.<br />
<br />
After waiting exactly three months living in the nursery, three absolutely horrible months of being a dirty, pathetic infant, Selina managed to sneak the regression pills into her possession once again. But her plan wasn&#39;t to force someone else to take them--that would be nearly impossible. No her goal was to take one for herself. Well, not one, but two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Where did Selina go?&quot; Asked the nursery worker who was planning on giving her a bath. She looked all around but couldn&#39;t find her. This resulted in the worker getting fired. After a few weeks of depression and anxiety, she wondered if something medically might be going on with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pregnant? Oh, um... wow... I&#39;m...&quot; Said her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re as surprised as I am! I thought our protection was perfect!&quot;<br />
<br />
Six months later, the former nursery worker--named Zoe Oster--delivered a baby. But it wasn&#39;t her baby per-se; this child&#39;s DNA had no inheritance from her. Zoe would name her Shelly, but the baby considered herself to be named Selina. A newborn once again, this was the situation Selina found herself in after regressing herself to the age of negative-six months.<br />
<br />
This childhood ended up being more stressful than the previous one. She was under a lot of pressure to do chores from an early age, and she found herself wetting the bed in elementary school. Here she was, four years out of diapers, but suddenly actually NEEDING to wear pull-ups at night! She just couldn&#39;t believe she still had to go through this kind of crap.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Selina&#39;s health just wasn&#39;t as good this time. She was always frail and sickly. She turned 16 and was still wetting the bed every night. That means she&#39;d been using pull-ups in bed every night for nine years!!! Worse still was that her mom insisted on getting her changed. Selina couldn&#39;t complain too much, because at least this time she has a mother who attends to her and gives her love and attention... but she found herself so uncomfortable being wiped up in the morning, and then powdered at night, by her own adoptive mother well into puberty.<br />
<br />
Selina had no desire to raid the home of her client. Not anymore anyway. She just wanted to live her life this time. But then, at age 19, her new mom Zoe was in a devastating car crash. In critical condition and fighting for her life, Selina went to her client directly and got down on her knees and begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll give your mother the regression you seek. Our team found out how to replicate the pills on our own, so there&#39;s more than enough for you.&quot; The client said. So much time had passed, that he himself barely cared anymore. He actually had the body of a child right now; fruitfully enjoying the perks of tiny youth.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Zoe&#39;s body had been so devastated by the crash, that she had to be regressed all the way down to 10 months in order to fully recover. The roles had been reversed; it was now Selina&#39;s job to be Zoe&#39;s mother. Selina told Zoe that she would help her use the toilet if she wanted, but Zoe insisted that diapers just felt better to use. Selina shrugged; she couldn&#39;t stand wearing those things, but she wouldn&#39;t judge her own mother and best friend for having the opposite opinion.<br />
<br />
Months turned to years, and Zoe eventually grew up into a 1st grader, but stayed in diapers. She was homeschooled by Selina, and didn&#39;t even have to learn much anyway. By age 15, she was making money online as a popular novelist. She drew attention to her work for being &quot;a teenager who can write like an adult&quot;, while successfully covering up the fact that she still wore diapers and her adoptive mom still changed her.</p>
