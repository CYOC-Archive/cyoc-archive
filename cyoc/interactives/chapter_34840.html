<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was with some trepidation that Lina and Amy waited for management but after a couple minutes Amy was glad to see Grace returning with a shrunken old woman wearing a bright red vest with the words 'Can I help you?' on the back.  When the old woman saw them she began chuckling and looking at Lina she said, &quot;I think you would look better if your eyes were golden.&quot;  Lina looked at a mirror and saw her red orbs change back to white and her pupil was golden and her iris was slitted like a serpent.  The woman nodded to herself as if she had confirmed something and then took a closer look at Amy.  Amy was shocked when the crone grabbed her breast but the woman frowned.  &quot;No, not that then.&quot; the woman muttered to herself, disappointed that she had guessed wrong before stepping back and looking at Grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said she mixed some inks.&quot; Grace nodded at this and the old woman sighed.  &quot;Very well, you two have been taking advantage of this store's products without paying for them.  Therefore you will be paying for these items.  It is impossible for me to remove them because they were enchanted that way.  The collar specifically.  The inks have been so mixed that I would have to bleach you of all that you are and then re-dye you back.  Just looking at you I can already tell you that you can't afford it.  However I do have some good news.  In the case of the collar I can make a few modifications.&quot;  Lina was just coming to the realization that she was stuck like this.  Forced to change by anyones random comments.  She couldn't take that, she would have to run off and become a hermit.  With an edge of desperation in her voice she asked, &quot;What can you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can make it so you are the only one who can change you, a standard security measure, and I can allow you to change back, in a fashion.&quot;  Lina was a little wary, &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can make it so you can transfer any transformation you've undergone to anyone you are touching at the time.  You would then revert back to your previous state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina didn't know if this was safe but she didn't want to be stuck walking around like she was.  She agreed to it and she waited expectantly as the manager grabbed Lina's collar and began twisting the spikes on it.  When the manager backed away she said,&quot;Now if you only had a dog's face to go with that collar.&quot;  Lina tensed but the collar didn't get cold and looking in the mirror she could see that her face hadn't changed.  &quot;Now, if there are any changes you would like to remove then feel free to use any of us.&quot;  Lina looked to see that the manager and Amy seemed excited by the prospect while Grace looked nervous.  Lina grabbed hold of the manager's hand and said, &quot;I think you'd look a whole lot better with a body like mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The collar turned hot and Lina gasped with pain as she felt herself growing younger and her clothes turned into liquid that traveled across their hands.  As the liquid crossed over the old woman's body, the manager began panting with excitement.  Her wrinkled and liver spotted skin became smooth and toned.  Her shrunken body was being stretched upward as though she were a piece of taffy.  Her snow white hair turned to ebony and various tattoos began appearing on her body.  As the liquid clothes began to solidify and the chains appeared but now they weren't loose and draping.  Instead they were wrapped tightly around her limbs, coiling to small circles, one on her back, and the other over her chest.  Both had clips on them that would connect to the hooks on the manager's bracers, knee bands, heels, and a loose chain that was tightly wound around her head, like a crown.  The woman's panting turned to moans and then as the transformation completed itself, Lina let the manager go and the woman dropped to the ground with a look of exultation on her face.  Lina was back to being 18 years old but her breasts still remained the same large size.  She was completely nude again but this time she didn't try to cover up, instead she grabbed Grace and said,&quot;I hope you don't mind exposing yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace cried out in fear, &quot;I didn't sign up for this.  I just wanted to make some money to pay for college.&quot;  Grace felt the heat from Lina's touch that she thought she would burn up.  Grace's clothes disappeared and gasped for air as Lina let her fall to the ground as well.  The heat didn't leave Grace however as she began to sweat.  Moaning in misery she tried to curl up into a ball.  Lina looked down at the two woman she had changed and was amazed.  She hadn't just given them what she had but she had been able to modify it as well during the transfer.  It was an addictive feeling, the knowledge and the power that she could change people however she wanted.  Amy looked down and whispered, &quot;What did you do to Grace?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina grabbed Amy's hand and smiled. &quot;Nothing compared to what I have for you, my little nightmare.&quot;  Amy tried to pull away but Lina had already begun.  This time Lina wasn't trying to transfer any change of her own but instead creating something entirely new.  The collar turned cold but the feeling was traveling through Lina into Amy and she shivered as her bright purple and yellow colored stripes darkened to midnight black and dark red.  Her hair transformed into living flame and floated upward.  Piercings began appearing on her body and with that Lina let go of Amy.  Lina looked at herself and was sad to see her piercing were gone.  Apparently she had to transfer something over with each change.  Instead of falling, Amy simply backed away and looked at what had been done to her.  Lina just had to ask, &quot;Was that transformation cool enough for you?&quot; Amy nodded as she placed one hand in her flaming tresses but they didn't burn her hand.  &quot;That was amazing but what did you do to these two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina grabbed the manager by her hair and pulled her head up to look into her eyes and said, &quot;I made them our thralls.  Now they'll do anything we say.  With power like this we need proper servants.  Now the other girl's name is Grace so I think I'll call you Mercy.  You like that don't you Mercy.&quot;  Mercy nodded her head smiling vacantly, &quot;Yes mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm calling you that because when I'm done with you you'll be begging for mercy.  For me to stop.  For me to start.  Because you'll never be sure which is the punishment and which is the reward.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for Grace, she will never wear clothes again, she will think it is uncomfortable and painful.  She will also crave sex like food.  She will find it almost impossible to go a whole day without it and will prefer it several times a day.  She'll be all yours to do whatever you want to Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we've taken care of our problems, how about we go over to my house and put our servants to work.&quot;  Staring at those golden eyes, Amy nodded and grabbed Grace by the arm and pulled her to her feet and slapped her on her ass.  Grace jumped and looked questioningly at Amy.  &quot;You'll be coming with us now.&quot;  Grace smiled not seeming to have a thought in her head.  Which proved untrue as Grace draped an arm around Amy's shoulder and Grace shoved her hand down Amy's top and began stroking her nipple.  &quot;I'm hungry now.&quot;  Amy felt herself responding to the advance but didn't do anything to stop it.  &quot;In time.  You can't rush a good meal you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina led them out to her car and began driving them all to her house.</p>
