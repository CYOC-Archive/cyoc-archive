<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen scanned the classroom around her as the minutes ticked down. She considered trying to get the teacher or her daughter take another pill, but decided she wanted to transform one of her classmates instead.<br />
<br />
The girl sitting to her right shared her next class, so Jen decided to transform her, so she could watch how she handled her transformations. Her name was Camilla, and she was also a senior, though unlike Jen she wasn&#39;t very athletic or popular. Jen didn&#39;t know much about her, though she&#39;d heard rumors that Cam was a lesbian.<br />
<br />
As 10:00 o&#39;clock rolled around, Jen cleared her throat, feeling the pill pop into her mouth. She quickly spat it out, and waited for her chance. As luck would have it, Cam surreptitiously began eating some cereal from a bag in her backpack, and Jen found her opportunity. She quickly tossed the pill into the bag, thankful that she somehow didn&#39;t miss. Cam fished another handful of cereal out and ate it, pausing slightly as she crunched down on the pill. She shrugged a little, and then swallowed. That was all the sign Jen needed, and now the fun would begin.<br />
<br />
Cam groaned as her ass began to grow out behind her. It burst out of her jeans and quickly filled the chair, her thighs pushing against the desk. She looked uncomfortable as she pushed her seat back, giving her growing legs more room, but soon her new weight was too much. The chair creaked, and she fell on the floor with a loud crash. Jen looked around, but no one seemed to notice.<br />
<br />
In the few seconds Jen was looking away, Cam had already undergone an extreme change. Jen about fell out of her own chair when she saw Cam again. She was standing back up, and her ass had grown even more. Her legs were also different, her feet having become hooves. Her shoes lay in shredded tatters on the floor below her. Her torso pushed out horizontally from her huge ass as she braced herself against the table. Her spine cracked loudly as it arched upwards, the top of her torso upright and her breasts pushed out while the bottom of her torso joined her lower body parallel to the ground. Her legs shifted as a huge udder grew in between them, almost reaching the ground. It pulsed. Thick brown fur, like a Highland cow, grew in on her ass and legs as a tail swished behind her. Her ass had finally stopped growing, towering over her torso at almost 10 feet tall, almost brushing the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Cam bent her torso back down to the desk and began taking notes. Her udder continued to pulse, visibly expanding between her legs. She shifted her weight a bit to make room, her ass jiggling heavily underneath her fur. Jen watched as she put her pencil down and reached down. She had to stretch as far as she could to reach one of her teats, and she began massaging it. With an almost inaudible grunt, she pushed an egg out of her teat. It was surrounded by sticky, green goo, and she quickly deposited it into a large, wheeled cooler that appeared next to her desk. She then returned to taking notes as if nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
Jen thought her transformation might be complete until a few minutes later, when Cam dropped her pencil. She watched as her face went completely blank except for her eyes. Her ears, nose, and mouth were just <i>gone</i>. Only her eyes, eyebrows, and bones remained. Jen wondered how she could even live, until she saw Cam&#39;s hands. They were shifting and growing, becoming a pair of animals&#39; heads. After a few minutes of uncomfortable cracking sounds as new bones and muscles grew in, they finished forming, and Jen recognized them as a pair of wolf heads. They were completely normal wolf heads, except for the fact that they didnt have any eyes. Jen watched as she grabbed the bag of popcorn with one of her mouths and moved it up onto the counter, where her other hand dug into the bag and began eating the cereal. She then took her pencil in her right mouth and began to write, though it looked far more difficult for her now. Jen watched with amazement as another change to her hands occurred a few minutes later. Large antlers grew in, and Cam rubbed them against her desk to remove the velvet. Jen soon saw that her antlers kept getting in the way, poking against her torso and huge, soft, furry rear.<br />
<br />
Jen was almost slackjawed at what the pill had done to Cam. While watching her transform, class had gone by like a breeze, and she was surprised by the bell. She quickly threw all of her stuff in her backpack to make it to her next class, but not before watching Camilla get ready. She used her wolf head hands to put her notebook away, leaving it with a slight saliva stain. She shifted again, quickly bending down. She tried to press her &quot;hands&quot; against her teat to release another egg, but her antlers kept hitting the floor. She sighed as Jen watched her strain, the teat pulsing until an egg released with a loud *PLOP* and fell to the floor. Cam couldn&#39;t pick it up, and Jen felt pretty bad for her, so she moved over to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I get that for you?&quot; she asked, bending over. Cam looked surprised but nodded, and one of her &quot;hands&quot; made a bit of a whine. Jen realized she couldn&#39;t talk anymore, only able to vocalize like a wolf. She placed the egg in Cam&#39;s cooler and walked away, but not before Cam tapped her on the shoulder and showed her a scrawled &quot;thank you&quot; written on a small whiteboard she&#39;d pulled from her backpack. She reached a hand out and licked Jen&#39;s face. Jen was touched, and responded with a quick &quot;no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she left the class to get to the next one, she stopped and turned around to watch Cam leave. She came out dragging her cooler beside her, pushing it out the door first. She moved her antlered headhands out to grip the sides of the doorframe before pushing her massive rear through the frame. It squeezed an unbelievable amount, straining the doorframe before she pulled herself free. It was impressive to see. Jen didn&#39;t think she&#39;d be able to fit through the door, because each of her ass cheeks looked larger than the doorway itself. Jen figured they must be mostly fat, or maybe more fuel for her egg udder. Thoughts raced in her head as she wondered what sorts of internal anatomy changes the pills were doing to its victims, without her even realizing!<br />
<br />
Jen then watched Cam shuffle on down to their next class, advanced chemistry. A jock gave her ass a loud slap while she slowly made her way through the hallway, while his friends laughed. Cam couldn&#39;t see who did it, but Jen heard her hands growl in unison.</p>
