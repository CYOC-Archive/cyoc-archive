<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt, Paul, and Don were dumbstruck when Kyle came back into the living room stroking his huge, alien tool. It was a bizarre and hypnotizing display. He seemed like he was in a trace stroking himself and dancing from foot to foot. Then, he leveled his cock and sprayed them all like he was wielding a fire hose.<br />
<br />
Before they could react the three teenagers were coated from head to toe in sticky, tainted, equine cum. Instinctively they threw up their hands and arms to protect their faces, but it did no good. All of them got some of the sticky cum in their mouths and were compelled to swallow. <br />
<br />
Kyle bolted and ran from the house before the choking, coughing, and cursing started. All three of them leapt from the cum soaked couch and ripped off their soaked and reeking shirts.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck! Can you believe this?!” Matt surveyed the damage to the couch and wall behind it. His parents were going to kill him when they returned tomorrow. <br />
<br />
“Damn! We stink! I can’t go home like this”, Paul complained.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s horse. That’s the only place I’ve seen junk like that.” Don’s uncle owned a ranch outside of town. He earned extra money helping out there in summer. Don used the remains of his shirt to wipe cum from his face and looked down at his reeking surf shorts shaking his head. <br />
<br />
“Wait a minute, you’re telling me that the curse that bitch of a cheerleader gave Kyle actually worked!” Matt was incredulous. Yes he was a regular role player, but magic in the real world was a whole different issue.<br />
<br />
“Guys, I feel weird”, Paul looked flush and was sweating. The other boys watched a squirming bulge form in his pants.<br />
<br />
“Shit”, said Don as his shorts seemed to have taken on a life of their own. He moaned as his changing cock slithered down his right leg towards daylight and freedom. A sidelong glance at Matt revealed a similar snake moving in his pants.<br />
<br />
For about a minute they all squirmed and groaned, massaging their crotches through their pants as their snakes slithered and grew. Their pants became tighter and constricting as their balls also swelled to equine proportions. Don’s mushroom shaped head finally reached open air announcing it’s self from the right leg of his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Don blinked first as he reached down and shed his shorts and underwear in one fluid motion. His now two foot mottled member sprang back and slapped him in the chest. The other two teens quickly followed suit with similar results.<br />
<br />
“What the hell do we do now?” Matt’s was all but cross-eyed staring at the massive smelly plunger hovering less than a foot from his nose.<br />
<br />
Paul let forth an erotic moan and began running his hands up and down his huge cock. He whinnied as the other two teens looked on, their own urges ready to break them. They too began stroking their cocks.<br />
<br />
Much moaning, groaning and whinnying ensued. There was no conversation. Each was locked in their own heads seeing visions of equine sex, their inhibitions being eroded and stripped away. They were all grinning as they worked themselves. It felt so good. They all reached a neighing climax at about the same time. All of their cocks erupted with sprays of equine cum.<br />
<br />
“My god!” Matt screamed as he erupted followed by a high pitched whiney. <br />
<br />
Instinctively Don turned towards Matt hosing him down with cum. Matt returned fire hosing Don down. Paul neighed getting both their attention, and a double hose down. <br />
<br />
Three minutes later they were standing, laughing in the cum soaked living room. Their cocks were flaccid, spilled out of their sheaths dripping cum. Their pendulous heads hung below their knees.<br />
<br />
“This is so gay”, commented Paul.<br />
<br />
“Who cares”, said Matt, “this is awesome.”<br />
<br />
The three teens approached each other and formed a circle. Their cum coated bodes and equine cock heads touching. <br />
<br />
The taint was driving them. A quiet voice they could not hear that spoke to them and compelled them to do more so that further changes would be made. Jen’s curse specified that things would finalize in 24 hours. In the meantime the taint would drive them further to become more equine.  <br />
<br />
“Too bad Kyle left”, Matt smirked. Without even seeming to think about his actions he snaked his arms around his partners and penetrated each of their asses.<br />
<br />
“That’s for sure”, commented Don. “This is a blast.”<br />
The other two teens each penetrated their neighbors, all of them started playing in each other’s asses. Their virgin holes being massaged and stretched wide.<br />
<br />
This lasted for 15 minutes as their cocks started to harden and intertwine. All of them were horny, bucking and thrusting against each other.<br />
<br />
“Let’s suck each other” volunteered Paul.<br />
<br />
“Sounds good”, said Matt. Don merely nodded.<br />
<br />
They backed up and let their hardening cocks spring free. Each grabbed the cock of the person on the right and started sucking, chewing and stroking. Ten minutes later they were cuming in unison, each trying to drink the flood spewing from their neighbor’s cock. In the process all were coated once again. This time when they released each other they were exhausted. They collapsed on the cum soaked couch in a heap of tired laughter, their crotches and asses itching pleasantly. While they all scratched idly the taint kept them blinded to the fur growing in. They hugged and kissed each other.<br />
<br />
“Guys, we have to share this.” Matt thought for a moment. “I guess we will have that party I was afraid to have after all. We’ll just keep it to our friends.”<br />
<br />
“You know they will run screaming as soon as they see us.” Paul seemed a little nervous.<br />
<br />
“We’ll just grab them and hose them down as soon as they arrive”, said Don. He butted Paul’s chest with his head and kissed him passionately silencing any objection.”<br />
<br />
“It’s settled then.” Matt reached for the phone and started dialing.<br />
<br />
===============================================================================<br />
<br />
Two hours later there were ten corrupted teens and two kegs of beer at the house. The boys had been successful at ambushing each arriving guest. The curtains were drawn and the door shut to prevent the neighbors from knowing there was an equine orgy going on. <br />
<br />
Bob who brought the beer was instructed to park in the empty garage which was promptly closed to block sight and prevent escape. The others got grabbed and dragged inside as soon as they rang the bell.<br />
<br />
Matt, Don, and Paul were presiding over the orgy/party.  By this time they sported long equine tails and the fur was spreading down their legs towards their ankles. Their hair was also long and flowing. <br />
<br />
Clothing of any kind was prohibited, and frankly the tainted guests liked it that way, once their equine cocks sprouted. All were now in various stages of transformation, most either having sex, or basking in the afterglow.<br />
<br />
The windows rattled at one point, but no one gave it much thought. The sex, drugs, and booze were just too good. This was the most rocking party any of them had ever attended.<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later the front windows shattered as two gas canisters landed in the living room. Panic ensued, but quickly ended as everyone at the party lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
=================================================================================<br />
<br />
“Trojan Horse, this is Thunder. Trojan Horse, this is Thunder, come in.”<br />
<br />
“Roger Thunder this is Trojan, report status.”<br />
<br />
“Target Beta has been taken. Cleanup in progress. Preparing ten tainted for transport. Be advised this is like nothing we have seen. Exercise caution. Unknown magical signature.”<br />
<br />
“Roger that Thunder, reception has been advised and is on standby.”<br />
<br />
“Trojan, our lock on target Gamma is broken, can you confirm?”<br />
<br />
The radio was silent for 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
“Thunder, this is Trojan. We confirm. Target has moved. There is a good chance that target Gamma is already in your custody. The signal was never strong.”<br />
<br />
“Roger Trojan, I concur. I’ll check last known location for Gamma then return team to base.”<br />
<br />
“Understood Thunder. Switch to frequency three. Out.”<br />
<br />
==================================================================<br />
<br />
Matt’s parents would not be troubled about the couch. They would be much more concerned about their missing son and friends who were presumably killed in the horrible house fire.</p>
