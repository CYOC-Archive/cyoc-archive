<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...my very own little brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, your younger brother?&quot; Your girlfriend asks as she&#39;s confused. &quot;Wait the seconds, when did you have a younger brother, hun? I thought you had your big brother and your bratty little sister only.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah I have my big brother who is still in college and that little bitch who is my sister who I don&#39;t like, but let&#39;s just say that I always wanted to have a good little brother for me to hangout.&quot; You explain to your girlfriend as you see her body is about to change. There wasn&#39;t much time to ponder this, though, as your girlfriends changes had begun. Since you both are the same age of 17, your ideal younger brother would be about 12, and your girlfriend seems to be de-aging and shrinking as well. &quot;W...whatta...?&quot; your girlfriend surprises as her dirty blonde medium hair has turned brown and shortened to a boyish pixie hair. &quot;Honey, you seem to get taller...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because you&#39;re changing, babe. The room is changing you into my brother.&quot; You reply as your girlfriend looks into the mirror to see her transformation. When she did look, she saw just what you&#39;re saying is right. She is changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, not my big breasts.&quot; Your girlfriend sadly replies as her breasts, which were increased from E cups, now deflat on her expanding chest, you feel sorry about her. &quot;Y... you better turn me back when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I will.&quot; You reply as you&#39;re promised your girlfriend that you turn her back soon, but right now you&#39;re going to enjoy your &#39;little brother&#39; with the summer. Now, her skin gets a light tan and gets so smooth. Finally, her face seems to grow younger and a bit feminine to resemble your mom&#39;s and dad&#39;s features more than her own. Your girlfriend&#39;s dress has turned into a green t-shirt, black shorts and two pairs of white trainers. When her transformation finishes, your girlfriend isn&#39;t no longer her... or himself, s/he is now your younger brother that you always wanted. &quot;Ohh... my god, something is growing between my thighs,&quot; your transformed girlfriend responds with her... or rather his new young boyish voice as s/he&#39;s holding his crotch. This means the final touch is his vagina reforming into his new penis. <br />
<br />
When everything is done, your former girlfriend comes toward the mirror to examine her/his new look in the form of a 12-year-old who resembles you. Then, s/he turned back to you, looking a little angry. &quot;Hey, I thought you said you didn&#39;t have a little brother. Who the heck am I if you don&#39;t have another sibling in your house?&quot; she said in a deep and young boyish baritone.<br />
<br />
The strange truth was that you did NOT have a brother.<br />
<br />
However, the more you look her more, the more you admit that if you had a brother about this age, this is what you would imagine he would look like. &quot;Hmm,&quot; you began. &quot;Maybe the room changed you into my ideal little brother that I always dream about, and it would have looked like if I had one. You know, it might have tried to predict what he looked like, and that&#39;s who you are now. And now you are the brother that I always wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your girlfriend, who is now your brother, still a little angry, let her/his expression loosen into a thinking look. She had to admit that your explanation did make sense, but she still thought of this as your fault. &quot;Well, I may not like the situation, but I guess we&#39;ll just have to face the fact that you wasted your change for today.&quot; she/he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; you tried to protest, but your girlfriend just laughed. You knew she was playing back with you now and decided to go with it. &quot;So, I guess you&#39;re going to be a little brat like all of the younger brothers I hear about. Well, I guess I&#39;ll just have to punish and chase you.&quot; With that, you began to chase her/him around the room.<br />
<br />
While chasing HIM, you had to take note of how fun this was actually turning out to be. Sure, this may not have been what you had in mind, but why not enjoy it? But after you had finished this thought, you finally caught your girlfriend and pinned her on the bed. With her pinned, you start tickling her/him as she giggles. &quot;Hahaha, haha,.... stop.... please.... I give up... no more...&quot; s/he begs and pleas for you to stop like a little boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gotta listen to me?&quot; You ask as you keep tickling him until he gives up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,... okay... you win... I surrender... please... stop...&quot; You laugh as you keep tickling her, but your tickling moves up her body. It&#39;s at this point that you begin to feel a little awkward. Sure, it&#39;s your girlfriend, but for a second, it really felt like you were doing something dirty with a relative and who is a 12-year-old boy.<br />
<br />
With that, when the little boy/your former girlfriend sees you stop and tries her hand at an attack. She reaches an arm up and pulls you by your shirt into a kiss. As you two kiss, things begin to feel really weirder. On one hand, you know it&#39;s your girlfriend, but on the other, it really feels like you&#39;re kissing a boy, a boy who is a little KID and younger than you. Plus, it&#39;s like you&#39;re kissing your own brother, even if you&#39;re straight!<br />
<br />
After the kiss, you both slowly move away and remain silent for a minute. However, after a time, your girlfriend finally decides to break the silence. &quot;So, did you feel like you were kissing your little brother? To me, if I felt like I was kissing my OWN big brother. This all is really strange. At first, I know I am your girlfriend that you turn into a little brother you&#39;ve wanted to have, and now I every time I want to do something with you, it feels like... gay incest. But after all, I&#39;m still your girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
After she or he said this, it was true for you, too. Sure, you may have never had another little brother, but what you saw when you looked at this boy is your girlfriend who you love for your whole life was your 12-year-old brother. What you felt when kissing her really did feel like gay incest. This was a very weird situation indeed. With that...<br />
<br />
What will you do next with your girlfriend who turns into your ideal little brother?</p>
