<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Whatcha doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and Sharon jumped, scrambling to cloth themselves as they turned to face the tiny voice. &quot;Mikey,&quot; Jeff exclaimed. &quot;What are you doing down here?!&quot; Mikey fidgeted in place, the boys eyes damp. Jeff sounded angry, the 4 year old now believing himself to be in trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff you&#39;re scaring him,&quot; Sharon said softly, the girl quickly dressing as she now knelt before the preschooler. &quot;Hi Mikey, did you get lost or something?&quot; Mikey nodded, the boy somewhat confused as to why he had wandered downstairs. The bots mind was fuzzy, had he followed someone? He wasn&#39;t quite sure. All he knew was that he stepped in the living room and the next thing he knew he saw Jeff and Sharon playing. He just wasn&#39;t sure why they were playing with half their clothes off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to take you back to your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey nodded, he did want to see his friends. The idea of Sharon taking Jim was just a bonus. Sharon was nice, she was pretty, the preschooler always liked when Sharon babysat him. He just wished she was his friend, like she was with his brother Jeff. &quot;Hey Jeff I&#39;ll take Mikey back upstairs,&quot; she said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you get us something to eat?&quot; Jeff sighed, grumbling under his breath as Sharon now took the boy upstairs.<br />
<br />
As Mikey and Sharon now walked back to his friends, Mikey glanced into Jeffs room. The glow of Jeffs computer immediately fascinating the boy as he darted away from Sharon. &quot;Mikey,&quot; Sharon exclaimed. Mikey was undeterred, clamoring into Jeffs chair as he gazed at the computer screen. The boy frowning as he looked at the different letters and numbers. He had only just begun to learn numbers and the alphabet but he still couldn&#39;t quite read. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mikey you shouldn&#39;t be in here,&quot; Sharon stated, her voice firm yet remaining friendly. &quot;You know Jeff doesn&#39;t want you playing on his computer. That&#39;s for grownups.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanna play,&quot; Mikey whined. &quot;Can I play please?&quot; Sharon chuckled, shaking her head no as she reached to pick the boy up. Giggling, Mikey flailed his arms, the boy hitting a key that now caused the Chronovac to activate once more.<br />
<br />
*Scanning* Reconfiguring parameters for previous subject.* Calculating parameters for current reality.* Initiate....<br />
<br />
Carrying Mikey back towards his room, Sharon was unaware of the Chronovacs actions. After scanning both Mikey and Sharon, the program realized both subjects had been altered physically. The program was advanced enough to determine that prior to the program activating both Sharon and Mikey were the same age. Now, the Chronovac determined to correct this inaccuracy.<br />
<br />
Placing Mikey down, Sharon couldn&#39;t help but smile as the energetic 4 year old ran to his friends. The girl couldn&#39;t help but find the young boy adorable with his infectious smile and mop of dark hair. Watching the three boys play, she couldn&#39;t help but sigh longingly. &quot;Enjoy it while you can kids,&quot; she thought. &quot;Once you get older, life gets alot harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unnoticed by everyone, the Chronovac was already effecting Sharon. The teenage girl slowly retreating in age as she watched the preschoolers. Sharon&#39;s face was rounding, her curves melting away as she descended into her early teens. Exiting high school, Sharon&#39;s clothing changed with her, becoming an outfit more appropriate for a middle schooler than a girl of 16. <br />
<br />
As puberty reversed itself further, Sharon began to grow smaller. Inches melting from the girls height, her breasts receding into softball sized mounds as she settled into her preteen years. As the girl became 10, Sharon&#39;s clothing once more morphed around her, the preteens training bra vanishing, her stylish tshirt taking on a childish style. <br />
<br />
Sharon&#39;s face continued to round, the grade schoolers body becoming skinny as her height continued to decrease. Now the age difference between Sharon and Mikey could be measured in a few years. The second grader more of a big sister to the group of preschoolers than a babysitter. Sharon smiled as she watched the little boys. The games they were playing looked like fun but she felt too old to play with preschoolers. Afterall, she was 7 years old and first graders didn&#39;t play with preschoolers. Right?<br />
<br />
Sharon&#39;s idea of playing with Mikey and his friends began to alter as the changes continued. She was a kindergartener, they were preschoolers. Maybe she could play but they were boys and boys were icky. The icky boys ides though began to supercede the idea of being too old to play with them. She was 5 years old, they were 4 years old. That wasn&#39;t right, she wouldn&#39;t turn five for another few months, they were all in the same preschool class together.<br />
<br />
Sharon shook her head, wondering what was going on. Slowly her memories cemented, the tiny blonde 4 year old looking at the group of boys. Jeff watched the group of preschoolers regularly, usually until the children&#39;s parents left work. Although Sharon was friendly with the group of boys, she did wish their were other girls she could play with. Shrugging her shoulders, she now approached Mikey curiously. &quot;Whatcha playing Mikey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cars,&quot; Mikey chirped, Sharon rolling her eyes. Cars were such a boy game. &quot;You wanna play Sharon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sharon groaned, the tiny blondes eyes lighting up as she noticed a Barbie car that had mistakenly gotten mixed into Mikeys car collection. &quot;Barbie,&quot; she squealed happily, grabbing the car as she began to play. Mikey and his friends giving the tiny girl an odd look before resuming their game. As the children played, none of them were the wiser as to Sharon&#39;s transformation. All they remembered was Sharon as a classmate and friend who was cool. For s girl.</p>
