<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a dreadful night of sleeping standing up in the cold barn, I was woken up when one of my new &quot;sisters&quot; bumped into me. I could feel a strange tension in the room and was dying to find out what the other cow-girl-boys were so ecstatic about. &quot;Moo?&quot; I turned to the redhead who had bumped into me. &quot;Moo, moo!&quot; he responded in an exciting tone, even though his face remained neutral as mine had earlier before. I realized they must have done something to prevent us from expression emotions non-verbally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning boys, or girls, or whatever you want to call yourselves now,&quot; an older man shouted loudly as he stepped into our area of the barn. &quot;We have a few newcomers, so I hope you other&#39;s didn&#39;t spoil the surprise for them,&quot; he laughed sarcastically. I noticed that while some of the cow-girl-boys almost ran out of the barn into the open field, others only reluctantly followed after several prompts from the older man.<br />
<br />
I followed curiously, wanting to know what was about to happen. It was a wonderful sunny morning, and just outside the wooden fence that would keep us in the large grassy field they led us into, I noticed three cat-girl-boys lying in a sunny spot. Their bodies had been significantly scaled down with only their faces still in their original size. Just like us cow-girl-boys their bodies had also been modified to resemble that of their respective animal, with a new cat-like posture, tabby-colored fur, a long tail and four cute little paws. When one of them looked over at me, I could also see that he had been given cat-like eyes and pointy cat-ears. And while like us, all of them still had their male human faces, their otherwise feminine hourglass forms and the clearly-visible little breasts confirmed that they had also been moved to the other side of the gender fence.<br />
<br />
I felt a bit envious realizing that they could probably roam around the farm freely, but realized that being a human-cow was my fantasy, while being a human-cat was theirs.<br />
<br />
My drifting mind was quickly returned to reality when I saw the massive creature with huge horns on his head further ahead in the field. I recognized his face as the guy who sat opposite of us in the waiting room, but otherwise ever other part of his body had been changed beyond recognition.<br />
<br />
While our cow-girl-boy bodies were a perfect, sexy symphony between skinny and busty supermodels and the animalistic features of a cow, the bull-man looked like a monster from a hellish horror movie: where we had four skinny legs that ended in cute little hooves, his hooves were much larger than ours, and his legs easily had four times the diameter of hours, bursting with heavily-visible muscles.<br />
<br />
Obviously not having the large breasts we were &#39;blessed&#39; with, both his upper and lower torso was equally packed with muscles, making him a mix between the most muscular bodybuilder and an animalistic bull monster. And while all of us cow-girl-boys had a lighter white to white-black-patched fur, he was entirely covered with a uniform dark brown-black coat.<br />
<br />
I could have sworn that his eyes lit up red when he noticed us entering the field, boldly beginning to paw with his hooves, and deeply growling like a locomotive. Clearly, his voice box was also different from hours. I was clearly intimidated by his daemon-like appearance, including his long and sharp horns. But I also experienced a completely new form of lust when I noticed his massive bull-cock below his modified torso. Was his masculinity naturally turning me on with me newfound femininity? Or had they also modified something else to make me feel this lust?<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be shy boys, he doesn&#39;t bite,&quot; laughed the older man as he closed the gate behind us. And while the first group of my sisters eagerly approached the bull-man, I noticed the others covering behind me. &quot;I know a lot of you boys have been eagerly waiting for a new bull since we &#39;lost&#39; the previous one,&quot; he continued, making me a bit uneasy about what he meant with &#39;lost&#39;. &quot;So as I promised to you yesterday, we were finally able to fill the position after a long recruiting period,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
I realized that this was the reason the &#39;herd&#39; had been acting so strangely this morning -- with some of my new sisters eagerly awaiting another bull, and others probably fearing what he might do to them. Personally, I was still processing this new situation and didn&#39;t initially notice that the bull-man was actually moving toward me, ignoring all those cow-girl-boys that tried to get it attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like he&#39;s already found a favorite; go get him, boy!&quot; the man announced, leaving me paralyzed when I realized that *I* was the &#39;favorite&#39; he was talking about. When I noticed that everyone behind me had snuck away, I also attempted to run. Somehow the bull-man had mastered walking on his new legs and hooves much better than I did, so I only managed to run away for a few seconds, before he managed to jump onto my back and mount me.<br />
<br />
&quot;First day and already the favorite; you should be proud of yourself!&quot; the man laughed, while I felt something large and unfamiliar enter my new female anatomy for the first time. With his heavy fore-legs holding me down, and preventing me from moving away, I was both deeply humiliated and excited about what he was about to do to me. The initial intense pain rapidly transformed into waves of ecstasy that repeatedly burned through my entire body, originating from my new bovine vagina. While I had recognized the previous orgasms from the milking machine as the most-intense sexual feeling I&#39;ve ever had experienced before, getting fucked by this bull-man and his massive dick was exceeding that former experience by a manifold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooo!&quot; I yelled in continued ecstasy, and gave up any resistance against him having his way with me. Had I been able to emit any facial expressions, I would have thankfully smiled at him. The whole process took several minutes, and his first own animal-orgasm was mirrored to me when his massive body shook his own climax though his muscles onto my own tiny one.<br />
<br />
Much more gentle than before, he carefully dismounted me and slowly approached me frontally. &quot;Pffuhhh,&quot; he growled carefully with his evenly expression-less face. &quot;Moo...&quot;, I returned seductively, carefully giving him a gentle kiss without having his horns tear themselves into my face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a beautiful little love couple,&quot; the older man picked up his annotation. &quot;Fuck you,&quot; I wanted to say, but only a strong &quot;moo&quot; left my voice box. Still perplexed by the whole situation, I now actually felt something for the bull. And even without being able to properly communicate with each other, I wanted to spend more time with him. Was it because he could make me feel so much better than the milking machine? Or was I actually falling in love with this scary monster that had just violated me?<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve had your turn; take the bitch back to the barn!&quot; the older man commanded to the stable boy when I tried to follow the bull. &quot;You better do what he says, girl,&quot; the stable boy stated almost empathically, and without any further resistance, I obediently followed him back into the barn.</p>
