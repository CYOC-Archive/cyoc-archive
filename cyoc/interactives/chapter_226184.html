<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Because he had so heavily prompted him to play the game, Lucas decided to play as a satyr like Elijah. It didn&#39;t hurt he happen to like how he looked as a satyr. Lucas was a dirty blonde, pasty, and lanky guy sitting just shy of 6&#39;. He couldn&#39;t really grow any facial hair beyond patchy stubble. While still lanky, his satyr avatar possessed a bit more muscle definition. His skin was lightly tanned or covered with patches of fur similar to the light dusty brown fur that covered his legs. Two small curving horns framed his face which sported a nice goatee. The satyr avatar seemed to wear only a simple loincloth customized in such a way to accommodate the small caprine tail. Clothing customization probably came after entering the game, Lucas thought to himself.  Having committed to satyr, Lucas pressed the button to begin the game. <br />
<br />
He was initially met with a blinding white screen as the machine prepared. Lucas instinctively closed his eyes to block the harsh light. Suddenly Lucas felt a rush as the Play-Pyramid VR system fully engaged. Where before Lucas could feel himself sitting relaxed in his room, he could now feel himself standing. He opened his eyes to see an entirely different world. Lucas stood in a cobblestoned square in front of a fountain.  Looking around he saw all sorts of beautiful classical style buildings bathed in a mid day sun. The realism and level of detail was amazing to the point Lucas could feel a slight breeze tickle against his fur and skin. There were even different scents floating on the air. It seemed the VR system even engaged olfactory senses, seemed to turn them up to match chosen species even. Now that he was actually in control of his avatar, Lucas truly took the time to inspect himself. He found a nearby bench and sat down. He felt his horns and ran his fingers thought the fur on his legs and body. It was incredible just how much he could feel each sensation from the weight of his horns to the occasional swish of his tail. Lucas found it somewhat surprising what was hiding under his loincloth. He had assumed that his avatar would be kind of like a ken doll, but sure enough he had a complete and functioning package. A package it seemed equally prone to erection as his real one. This game really did seem to care about immersion and realism. <br />
<br />
Standing up from the bench, Lucas decided to try and find Elijah. The game didn&#39;t seem to have a specific tutorial system, and  as a satyr himself, Elijah could probably offer some insight on what to do in the world. Thankfully the Goat&#39;s Hoof Tavern wasn&#39;t hard to find either. Lucas quickly spotted a sign with a goat on it and &quot;Goat&#39;s Hoof&quot; written in large letters under it. He saw a number of satyr entering the establishment. Whether they were players or NPCs Lucas did not know. It seems myth simulator did not bother with status bars or any method of distinguishing the two. Lucas walked towards the tavern. He found walking on his new legs surprisingly easy. Cloven hooves and the altered shape definitely felt different than his human legs, but at the same time they still felt very natural. Maybe it was the system helping him out.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the tavern Lucas was hit with a number of strong smells. Mainly that of wine, but looking around he also figured many of the scents were coming from the various satyr patrons spread throughout. Interestingly there was some variety among the satyrs. They all had various different shapes and sizes of horns. Some possessed more goat like qualities than others. Lucas guessed it had to do with age as the larger horned and more caprine satyrs appeared more mature than he did.  On top of his observations about appearance, Lucas quickly noticed that the satyr customers inside were all completely nude. Not long after realizing that Lucas was approached by a satyr employee wearing an apron. <br />
&quot;Would you like me to take your clothes to the check in sir?&quot; he asked.<br />
I guess this is supposed to be an 18+ game Lucas thought to himself. Quashing any bashful feelings and embracing his new satyr avatar, Lucas quickly removed his loincloth and handed it to the aproned satyr with a nod.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take this to the clothes wrack sir, please go ahead and sit anywhere,&quot; said the employee. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually looking for someone,&quot; Lucas said, &quot;they are a regular here, can you help me find them?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Name?&quot; asked the aproned satyr <br />
&quot;Elijah,&quot; Lucas tells him.<br />
&quot;Oh, he&#39;s in the middle of a bout downstairs.&quot;<br />
&quot;A bout?&quot; Lucas inquired.<br />
&quot;Here I&#39;ll show you, follow me.&quot;<br />
Without another word the aproned satyr led Lucas down a set of stairs in the tavern. They opened up into a large room filled with mainly cheering satyrs though Lucas could spot a few other creatures spread throughout the crowd. Their eyes seemed to be fixated on a combat style ring in the center. At the center of the ring were two satyrs with horns locked attempting to push each other out of the ring. Occasionally they would break their lock and attempt to ram each other with their curved horns. Lucas could see one of the satyrs in the ring was Elijah. <br />
Lucas was impressed seeing his friends satyr form. Elijah had an athletic body and thick dark hair as a human. It seemed being a satyr augmented those features. Like Lucas, his muscles were a bit more defined. His thick black hair and the dark fur on his legs and spread around his body also seemed to possess a nice luster. Not sure if it was the atmosphere or any latent feelings towards his friend, but Lucas could feel his cock stir a bit watching the match. <br />
Elijah seemed to have the upper hand. With steady effort he kept pushing until the other satyrs hooves slid over the edge of the ring. The room erupted in cheers as a ref raised Elijah&#39;s arm in victory. He exited the ring receiving congratulations from all those he passed. Among those approaching Elijah was the aproned satyr. Instead of congratulations the aproned satyr pointed back to where Lucas was waiting. Upon seeing Lucas, Elijah&#39;s eyes lit up and he quickly rushed through the crowd to where Lucas was waiting. <br />
&quot;You picked a satyr,&quot; Elijah yelled excitedly as he approached.<br />
Before Lucas could even respond Elijah had wrapped him up in a strong hug. Elijah&#39;s scent was overwhelming as he pressed his sweaty body against him. Lucas, and more importantly Elijah, could feel his cock growing erect in the face of all the extreme stimuli.   After breaking the hug, Elijah looked at Lucas with a sly smile. <br />
&quot;If you like we can go relieve that in a private room,&quot; Lucas said. &quot;Or I can show you around a bit first.&quot;</p>
