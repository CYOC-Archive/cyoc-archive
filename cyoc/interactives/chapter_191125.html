<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erin takes his gaze off of his flattened form to look up at Dave, he pauses for a moment before trying to speak. Dave looks at his friend before reminding Erin again that he can&#39;t hear him. Erin stops trying to talk and rolls his eyes, sighing before taking his hand off his crotch and points to the canvas&#39;s side to try to get Dave&#39;s attention, making motions as if he wants to talk to him then pointing back to the edge of the canvas. Dave gets the hint and touches Erin&#39;s canvas with his palm as his 2D friend freezes in place. <br />
<br />
Dave gives the command for Erin to be able to speak before letting go of his painting. &quot;Alright dude, what do you think about this? You willing to be repainted into a french maid?&quot;<br />
Erin blushes deeply and giggles a bit to himself at the thought of being changed into a pretty french maid. Multiple ideas running though his head about posing in a revealing manner as he serves tea or reaching up to clean something making his super short mini skirt russle making him even more horny than he already was. He looks at Dave and nods several times then says, &quot;I... I... I think i&#39;d love that! But... umm... you know I like anime styles more than realism right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well yeah, I know that, that&#39;s what I thought you would want anyways. You talk about it all the time. I&#39;m guessing theres something specific you want to look like?&quot; Dave says plainly, almost expecting his friend to say that.<br />
&quot;Well, kinda... I mean, I don&#39;t want to be a photocopy of someone who exists already... but maybe... I don&#39;t know... I mean, I&#39;m litterally a painting now so I can be made into anything.... I guess... inspired by is a better word? Do I get to decide what I&#39;ll look like?&quot; Erin said questioning what it is he wanted to be.<br />
Your the art, not the artist. I&#39;m the one who gets to paint you, so you tell me what you want to be and I&#39;ll make it happen. If you don&#39;t like it I&#39;ll change it. Okay?&quot; Dave said with a bit of enthusiasm and pride in his skills as he flicked the brush around in his hand.<br />
&quot;Yeah Umm... sounds good to me! ... So what happens when your done painting me as a french maid? You going to pull me out of here and make me clean your house or something?&quot; Erin says with a bit of a quiver in his voice, showing his audible worry from being litterally at the mercy of dave&#39;s art skills but also his rising excitement to be changed.<br />
&quot;Well first off, I still don&#39;t know if you can even get out of that painting and with no one else remembering you right now, we got plenty of time to figure this stuff out, so until then I might as well make you into something you and I would both enjoy.&quot; Dave says thinking the possible results over in his head.<br />
Erin then speaks up again, thinking about the results of such an extreme change might have on him as well, &quot;So... if you pull me out of here and I&#39;ve been painted into a french maid... Will it do anything to me? Like, mentally? Will I still be myself or... Will anyone still remember me if I no longer look like me?&quot;<br />
Dave interrupts his friend to try to re-assure him, &quot;Well, if that happens I&#39;ll shove you back into the painting and change you back. If no one still remembers you as a real person beyond that point well...&quot; Dave pauses as he thinks of how to word his thought carefully. &quot;I, I guess you&#39;ll just be a painting... forever.... That&#39;s kinda what you wanted isn&#39;t it? I mean, I&#39;ll repaint you into whatever you or I want and if you can be turned into a 3D... thing... I guess we can just have fun with it... Honestly I have no idea what will happen IF you leave the painting after being repainted into something else or if you even CAN leave the painting period. There is that chance Erin that you may just be stuck in there forever. As far as everyone else thinks your just a painting and I&#39;m your artist. But if you can be turned back 3D after being repainted into whatever I want and still be yourself then... Well, we will figure that out later. You listening Erin?&quot;<br />
Erin just passively smiles back at Dave. Both somewhat worried about potential permanent damage to his being but also the realization that, he may genuinely trapped inside that painting... permanently... And with no one knowing of his existance beyond that he&#39;s just a painting, Dave absolutely could just de-animate him and prevent him from speaking and thats all really would be... just a painting. But all that worry was also exciting. Erin had never felt more alive being 2D, everything feels amazing, granted he can&#39;t get off but at the same time he begins to think does he need to really? Now that he doesn&#39;t need to sleep, to eat, to drink, to take a dump, he can just be a happy horny painting forever, and that might very well be the case. What if he CANT get out AT ALL... If that really was the case, then he might as well fully enjoy his painted existence. and so what if no one knows he exists, even if he can pop out of the painting, Dave is here and Dave is his friend! <br />
&quot;Dave...&quot; Erin finally says. &quot;I&#39;m ready to be painted into the french girl of your dreams. If I&#39;m going to be trapped inside this painting for eternity, then I might as well enjoy being your art project completely. Just... please keep me always in an anime style and If I really can&#39;t come out of here and you have to leave, please paint me something to do in here or de-animate me until you come back? I don&#39;t want to be bored.&quot;<br />
Dave stares at Erin for a minute. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;d want that? You know I&#39;m going to try to get you out of that painting when were done changing your body right...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, and I want to see if I can too. I want to see what happens to me if I return to 3D and if I cant then I&#39;m okay with staying a painting permanently, if I can&#39;t go back to normal, then as long as I get to belong to you then I&#39;m okay with anything you to do me. Not like I have a say in this anyway.&quot; Erin says, rather accepting of his fate and still very much excited for what is about to happen to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Dave says before taking in a deep breath. &quot;Arms to your side, T-pose for me and stop moving. It will make this a lot easier.&quot; Dave says touching Erin&#39;s canvas as Erin&#39;s body is forcefully compelled to do as Dave says, even though he was in the process of doing so prior to being forced to do so. &quot;I&#39;m going to want you to still be able to talk to me so you know what I&#39;m doing and want me to change this or that to be something else.&quot; Dave says to Erin as his friend finishes posing for his artist. Erin replies with a simple &quot;okay&quot; as Dave let&#39;s go of the painting, leaving Erin to pose motionlessly on the canvas as he readies his paints. &quot;Any way you can see yourself while I do this or are your eyes forced to just see out of the canvas like being glued to a window.&quot; Dave asks. &quot;I can turn my vision around so I can see myself, but I won&#39;t be able to see you working.&quot; Says Erin. &quot;Okay do that, rather you see the results as they happen.&quot; Replies Dave. Erin stays there for a minute expecting his vision to forcefully change to meet Dave&#39;s wishes, but instead nothing happens. &quot;Huh, hey Dave, my vision didn&#39;t change when you told me to.&quot; Erin says a bit confused. &quot;Must be something I can&#39;t change. Hope for the rest of your mind that remains true.&quot; Dave replies with a bit of a happy relief and a bit of assurance his friend won&#39;t be erased in the process of the repainting. &quot;Me too.&quot; replies Erin who is begining to re-orient his vision to see himself plastered on the canvas. Once Erin&#39;s vision wraps around the canvas so his painted image and the blank background are all he can see. He hears Dave call to him again. &quot;Okay Erin, I got all my paints and brushes ready. Are you ready?&quot; Says Dave as Erin hears his disembodied voice from somewhere outside of the scene. &quot;I am!&quot; He happily replies. &quot;Okay, here we go...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin feels a cold wet chill run up his side as a line of black paint is added to his scene on his right side. The sensation like a deep sensational lick from a ghostly tongue lovingly stroking his most sensitive areas radiating across his body from his right side as the brush makes contact with his image. He would gasp and jump from the excitement if his body wasn&#39;t suspended in a T pose animation. He then feels it again as another line of black paint is added to his form, then another, and another, and another. With several brush strokes, the vague shape of a black mini-dress has begun to take form over Erin&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;How ya feeling buddy?&quot; Asks dave, pausing from painting so Erin can give a coherent response.<br />
&quot;If I could describe how this feels... Why did you stop?! That was like the best sex I ever had! Please don&#39;t stop!&quot; <br />
Dave busts out laughing, &quot;Oh gawd, this is getting you off now?!? That&#39;s fucking stupid funny and so wrong at the same time! Ahahahaha!&quot; <br />
&quot;Dave... I was being serious&quot; Erin cries. Erin now able to think and feel properly for a minute realizes that he can feel the &#39;dress&#39; that&#39;s been painted onto him as if it was a part of his body, the sensation growing as the paint slowly begins to dry. &quot;Oh oh! Dave! Dave! I can feel this erm... dress you&#39;ve painted onto me, It feels like its... becoming a part of me! This is so exciting!!&quot; Erin screams.<br />
&quot;Oh so now you want me to keep going?&quot; Dave cries still trying not to laugh as he returns to painting a black and white maid dress onto his friend. &quot;Oh this is too funny and stupidly amusing...&quot; Dave says as he goes back to work despite all of Erin&#39;s excited yelps, moans and cooing.<br />
<br />
After 15 minutes, the maid dress has really begun to take form. Erin&#39;s chest feeling increasingly more feminine and dainty as his new image is drawn to form over his old one. &quot;Hmm, I was thinking a nice D for your tits Erin.&quot; Dave says, examining his work so far. &quot;Double Ds!&quot; Pipes up Erin. &quot;Oh I can do that...&quot; Replies dave as he begins to add the highlights and under tones to Erin&#39;s dress. Even though Erin&#39;s body is completely flat and devoid of depth, he could swear he feels like his 2D chest is changing to accommodate the tits being drawn onto his dress&#39;s upper half. <br />
<br />
With another 15 minutes of work, the changes to Erin&#39;s torso are complete. &quot;So how ya feelin in there buddy?&quot; Dave asks. &quot;Like im a cartoon of a tranny. Do you think you could change my curtains to match the drapes? I feel so incomplete...&quot; Erin cried. Dave tries to hold back a chuckle at Erin&#39;s comment. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll work on your waist next.&quot; Dave says. &quot;I want an extra short frilly skirt! I want you to be able to see my panties when I bend over!&quot; Erin demands. &quot;Oh you wanna be in panties... what color?&quot; Dave asks trying not to chuckle. ~he&#39;s really getting into this just as much as I am~ Dave thinks to himself. &quot;Umm... black... with white edges! And about my waist...&quot; Says Erin as Dave cut&#39;s him off. &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about your waist. I have my own ideas for your butt I think you might like&quot; Dave says as he begins to get back to work on Erin&#39;s image. &quot;Bend over and show me your ass.&quot; Commands Dave, as Erin&#39;s body is forced to take a rather revealing pose and within seconds, feels another cold chill radiate from all over as the Dave&#39;s brushes make contact with his behind and make all the nessisary changes. Erin feels his backside being changed and widened to match a more hour-glass shaped female form, as his new panties and &quot;skin&quot; are painted over top of his jeans and he feels his 2D body underneath morph to match the change as the paint is added and begins to dry. After about another 15 minutes, Erin is commanded to turn around and take another pose, revealing his front and spreading his legs. This time Erin loses his mind as the brush makes contact with his crotch, covering it in black paint that is soon to be his panties, the change makes him go wild as his dick inside of his 2D pants begins to change, for the first time, Erin feels like he was able to cream as his waist is changed to match his top half. Erin screams in orgasm as his inanimate 2D body overflows with euphoric feelings as his body is literally being turned into wet paint, with his manhood and center of pleasure now caught up in the think colored goop that is being infused into his form, his body feels like it is not only exploding with jizz more and more with every stroke of fresh paint added to him, but is meshing with it and becoming an inanimate pleasure-feeling paste of paint and colors. <br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s scream begins to fade into a deep moan before falling silent as his mind becomes fully absorbed into his scene and lost to pure orgasmic bliss. With Erin now out of it, Dave tries to call to him several times, but his friends pleasure has made him too euphoric to respond outside of moaning and cooing. Dave decides he&#39;s heard enough of Erin&#39;s sexual pleasing and decides to mute his voice so he can work in peace. With Erin now just a silent inanimate image, Dave decides to finish Erin&#39;s legs to match his new dress and panties, adding the frilly black and white trimmed skirt, a white apron and white ribbon collar to his shirt with a green gem in it&#39;s center, a name tag on the left side of his chest reading &#39;Erin&#39; and a cute black and white little belt to match his new shirt collar. Dave then move on to his legs, adding white with black trim upper thigh high leggings to coat his new feminine legs to match his now apple round ass, before finishing off his legs with small cute little black shoes with white ribbons and a nice green flower in the middle. Finishing Erin&#39;s legs, Dave tries to call out to him again but his friend  is still lost in orgasm, So Dave goes to paint his friends new arms. Giving him Frilly sleeves to match his black and white trimmed frilly super short skirt and panties, long black opera gloves that cover his fingers up to his mid-upper arm with a matching frilly white trim to his gloves. With Erin&#39;s new form mostly complete besides his head, face and hair, Dave decides to wait for his friend to calm down before continuing. &quot;I&#39;m going to want Erin&#39;s input when I work on his hair and face, but it looks like I&#39;m going to need him to calm down first.&quot; he says to himself, grabbing Erin&#39;s painting and telling his body to take a neutral pose so he can calm down. <br />
<br />
Dave then goes to make coffee since he&#39;s been at painting for about 3 hours now. Meanwhile Erin is completely delirious. Now finally having that complete orgasmic release he has been constantly nagging and teasing him from being trapped inside the painting for almost two days, but never arrived. Every last second, feels like an eternity. His whole body is singing in orgasm from the neck down now as his mind and being melds with his new shape. The orgasmic afterglow from being repainted only slowly fading as his paint dries. After about another hour, Dave comes back up to his upstairs studio to check up on Erin, who is a bit more responsive now that his paint isn&#39;t nearly as wet now.<br />
Dave sets his hand on the side of Erin&#39;s canvas and calls to him, &quot;Hey Erin, you awake in there? Come on buddy, talk to me.&quot; Dave calls to his friend, but Erin only mumbles in reply, while responsive he is still clearly lost in orgasm. &quot;Uhhhh, so..... good... fucking hell... Dave...? I feel.... I feel.... like...&quot;<br />
~Ah, he&#39;s still there, good I was starting to get worried~ Dave thinks to himself before addressing his delirious friend. &quot;Take some time to dry dude and settle down. I think you might want to be a bit more conscious before I start work on your hair and face.&quot; Dave says to his friend, now re-assured he hasn&#39;t been lost to the change.<br />
&quot;Ye-yeah... my face... and... hair? I- I want... I want green hair... and... red, red eyes.... yeah....&quot; Erin mumbles.<br />
&quot;Green hair and red eyes huh?&quot; Says Dave.<br />
&quot;Yeah.... Long, flowing, green hair and deep, ruby, red, eyes... Yes...&quot; Erin replies as if he&#39;s talking in his sleep.<br />
&quot;I think you need to rest dude, your clearly having one hell of a time in there.&quot; Dave replies.<br />
&quot;N-NO! I-I need to be complete! I feel soo incomplete! Please... Finish me! Turn my face into paint! I need to be complete!&quot; Erin screams and cries between his orgasmic moaning.<br />
&quot;Well if your THAT ready then I might as well finish then.&quot; Says Dave ~He want&#39;s green hair and red eyes? That&#39;s what I was thinking when I went down stairs to make coffee and get something to eat... Huh... Guess I just kinda knew what he wanted already.~ Dave thinks to himself as he gets his brushes and gets to work on what remains of Erin&#39;s original form. <br />
<br />
Erin feels the brush return to touch his face, the sensation making his body quiver in more cold, wet, orgasms as his entire face is covered in paint, stroke by stroke. Erin feels like hes about to be fully submerged into his own little painted world as the paint fully covers his face, as if he&#39;s being pushed out of his body and deeper into the canvas but still stuck too it. As the brush leaves his face to get ready to paint his hair, Erin&#39;s face feels like its made of slime and slowly rising back up to the 2D world he sank below from. But his head feels like its being pulled back in on the top as his hair, the last thing that remains of his original form is dipped in brilliant deep green paint and he is flipped over again by his painter. The paint being added feeling like it is physically adding hair to him then brushing it softly with its wet orgasmic touch. After another 30 minutes of painting Erin&#39;s new hair, he is flipped over again to do touch ups on his face, to give him a more feminine appearance. Long eyelashes are added and rosey cheeks to match Erin&#39;s new pale and flawless skin complexion. His deep red eyes given a deep and loving appearance, literally, as Dave paints heart shaped pupils into Erin&#39;s new eyes. Dave puts extra painstaking detail into Erin&#39;s face, spending roughly an hour to finish his work before finally putting the brush away. <br />
<br />
Erin is in total bliss as he feels his paint fully, and completely, slowly sucking his being into his new image like putting on a thick wet rubbery suit very very slowly. As Erin begins to slowly adjust to mentally fit his new image and body, they don&#39;t even realize that they feel asleep in the process of being painted into a french girl as Dave finished their face, only that he is now one and feels like they are accepting their new being as one. Erin begins to feel completely comfortable with her new form and body, unlike before when she was male and not literally made of paint, the canvas was a static but enjoyable, stimulating experience that constantly left her on edge, now that she is literally made of paint, the 2D experience inside the canvas is far more comforting and pleasure on every single bit of her body. She feels completely at peace and euphoric, enjoying every last second of her new existence, even though she is now literally just an inanimate 2D image made of actual paint. As her painted form continues to dry, her feeling of a continuous wet orgasm fades in favor of a sense of pleasure and comforting feeling. Every single molecule of her new painted form she can feel perfectly; her painted dress, her flowing green hair, her brilliant red eyes, the tied black and white bow on top of her head, her long flowing gloves covering her soft delicate little hands, her dainty little shoes and pure white stockings, her frilly skirt briskly touching her plump apple round ass, her double D sized breasts tightly pressed up against her shirt, her name tag to help remind her her name, and her perfect black with white lace panties partially hidden under her skirt revealing her faint camel toe pussy, she was in love with all of it. It was her now, this is who Erin was. A painting of a french maid, made by an artist to be the perfect depiction of his dream girl, and that man who she was painted to exist for was Dave. What Erin didn&#39;t realize was how much time has passed since Dave finished her painting or that Dave had went to bed to give Erin time to fully dry. <br />
<br />
As the morning soon approaches unbeknownst to Erin, she hears Dave&#39;s familiar voice as a hand touches her image to see if she is fully dry The voice begins to become more clear as Dave calls to her, shaking her senses fully aware as she wakes up and see the artist who drew her admiring her painted form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Erin, you awake? If your in there, you can go ahead and move on your own now. Sorry I left you alone all night, I thought you could use the time to fully dry. So, how are you feeling?  You look like you turned out great. You look just like a real painting of a french maid.&quot;</p>
