<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are...are you sure,&quot; Ty stammered. &quot;Are you really willing to grow up all over again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will we get clothes that fit,&quot; Jill asked sheepishly, once more tugging her loose sleep pants into place. Ty stifled a laugh, nodding as both teenage girls glanced at one another. &quot;What do you say Eileen? Wanna do over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen paused, glancing at her loose housecoat and adjusting her I&#39;ll fitting underwear. &quot;I can&#39;t even remember being old right now,&quot; she said softly. Ty held his breath, watching the pair. Part of him would love nothing more than to have Jill and Eileen as his peers. The reality alterations made showed him how close the trio were. They were his closest friends and for someone who had been lonely most of his life, it was a dream come true.<br />
<br />
Still, the idea of losing an adult he not only trusted but viewed as a confidant, was disheartening. Eileen was a unique package for Ty. Part lover, part protector, part best friend. He would gain an energetic, fun loving teen but lose the wisdom and experience he needed from the adult. It was truely a coin toss as to which he wanted more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets do it,&quot; Eileen exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it means not being old enough to drive anymore,&quot; Ty asked. Jill and Eileen paused, realizing their birthdays were almost a year away. &quot;Guess it just means we&#39;re all taking Driver&#39;s Ed together,&quot; she smiled. Ty nodded, a smile forming on his face as now adjusted reality.<br />
<br />
A wave now seemednto ripple out from the group, Jill and Eileen gasping as they gazed at their clothing. The formerly adult clothes now rippled, the teens watching as they shrank down to fit their teenage bodies. Eileen giggled, watching the hem of her housecoat lift slightly, fitting her teenage body perfectly. <br />
<br />
Jill too breathed a sigh of relief, the waist of her sleep pants clinching tighter around her narrow waist as the gems lifted, no longer dragging on thw floor. Quickly Eileen now took Jill&#39;s hand, pulling her towards the upstairs. &quot;Cmon Jill let&#39;s go check out my room!&quot; Jill could barely utter a response as the energetic Brazilian teen now bounded up the stairs. As they now left Ty alone, he began to study the house more carefully.<br />
<br />
Already he could see the items in Eileen&#39;s home changing to fit this new reality. Pictures of Eileen began to alter. Ty watched as a picture of Eileen and a young Becca began to shift. The young Becca image growing older as the Eileen image grew younger. Now mother and daughter had swapped roles, Becca being the mom with Eileen as the child.<br />
<br />
These changes continued, Ty watching anything the adult Eileen possess, changing completely. Her purse transforming from expensive adult to cite teen accessory. Eileen&#39;s college and high school diplomas shifting to display Beccas name. Everything the adult Eileen owned now passed in ownership to Becca.<br />
<br />
As Ty glanced outside, he could see the wave expanding. Eileen and Beccas cars remained unchanged, although Ty could now recall that Eileen&#39;s car belonged to Becca. Beccas old car now appeared to have not been moved in quite sometime. This made sense to Ty, if Eileen was too young to drive then the car wouldn&#39;t be used often. That car was there for when Eileen finally did get her license.<br />
<br />
As Ty watched the wave expand he now glanced at Jill&#39;s car. Thr former adults car was still their, the alterations having yet taken place. As the wave hit the car, Ty watched in wide eyed wonder as the car slowly began to vanish. In only moments, Jill&#39;s car faded from reality cementing her status in this new reality as a teenager. &quot;Well my room looks great,&quot; Eileen exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Ty now glanced towards the stairs, noting an excited Eileen beaming at him. &quot;Thid I&#39;d going to sound so weird but everything looks normal,&quot; Eileen said quickly. &quot;Which is super weird since according to you I was a grown up. All my clothes are the same, bed is the same, even my room is the same but I&#39;m guessing you chamged all of that to fit teen me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Ty shrugged, flashing her a sly smile. Eileen giggled, skipping over to Ty before placing a quick kiss on his cheek. &quot;Well if you did change my stuff you have good taste,&quot; she giggled. Ty chuckled, glancing at Eileen. This teenage version of her was incredibly fun, and incredibly flirty. What was even stranger for Ty is his memories surrounding the pair of newly minted teens. Both Jill and Eileen were virgins in this reality. Although Ty recalled his love making with Eileen, she didn&#39;t, making him now more experienced than the person he had lost his virginity too. This irony wasn&#39;t lost on him as he watched the pair. How would the three of them progress in their relationship?<br />
<br />
Ty now watched as Jill and Eileen exclaimed changed hushed words. He couldn&#39;t quite make out what they were saying, but Jill looked frightened. Ty watched the pair carefully, Jill&#39;s eyes bulging as she seemed to hiss her response back at Eileen. Watching closely he could see the blonde teens cheeks flush in embarrassment as Eileen now turned to Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m going to go take a shower,&quot; she said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you and Jill talk while I&#39;m upstairs.&quot; Jill appeared hesitant, making a last ditch effort to protest as Eileen pushed her forward. Eileen now giggled, her barefeet slapping the stairs as she raced to the bathroom, leaving her bewildered and obviously nervous friend with Ty.<br />
<br />
Jill now forced a smile, her cheeks burning in embarrassment as she pushed her hair behind her ear. &quot;So,&quot; she said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Ty answered back. Jill said nothing, her shyness rooting her to the spot as she now avoided eye contact. Ty now found himself in a new situation, being the more forward person in an introduction. &quot;You want to sit on the couch,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jill squeaked. Ty now watched as Jill awkwardly made her way to the couch, taking a seat before shyly gazing down at the floor. Not wanting to make things uncomfortable, Ty now decided to start the conversation. &quot;So Jill do you want to know anything about your adult life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill looked up, puzzled by the question before nodding. &quot;Um sure, &quot; she replied. The girl now paused, trying to figure out her next sentence before responding. &quot;So was I married? Did I have any kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a widow,&quot; Ty answered. &quot;And although you wanted kids you never had any. You said you did wish you had kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Jill said softly. &quot;So this is like, a second chance. And, I could even have kids if I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you thought about having kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Ty,&quot; Jill exclaimed, the girl looking flummoxed. &quot;I&#39;m still wishing to have a boyfriend! I haven&#39;t even really thought about all that!&quot; Jill  lashed redder, the girl blushing redder as she shyly gazed at Ty. &quot;Uh this sucks,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Like, I feel like I&#39;ve known you forever, even though I haven&#39;t and my stomach is all gurgly, which is supper weird since I&#39;ve like known you since we were all six. Which isn&#39;t true since apparently yesterday Ibwas like, super old and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill sighed, her shoulders slumping as she gazed at Ty. &quot;I&#39;m babbling aren&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I was um..a grown up did I sound this much like a dork?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you seemd really cool Jill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill smiled, appreciating the compliment. Now finding some confidence, she turned to face Ty. &quot;Okay I&#39;m just going to come out with it,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m crushing on you okay. Like, I&#39;ve been crushing on you since we were 12, even though we weren&#39;t both 12 together. But anyway, Eileen knows and she told me to just ask you out but I&#39;m worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you worried?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of you and Eileen,&quot; she said. &quot;Like, the old Eileen was like a girlfriend maybe I don&#39;t know. But the one I know...and also you. You guys kind of flirt all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are me and Eileen dating?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jill said quickly. &quot;But everyone at school thinks you are. Which makes it even weirder since we&#39;ve never actually been to school..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jill you&#39;re rambling,&quot; Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
Jill blushed, offering a meek apology. &quot;Okay so here&#39;s the thing,&quot; she said. &quot;Eileen knows I have a crush on you, which is why she hasn&#39;t started dating you. But, um..I want to know...if um...you would...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be your boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jill nodded, an anxious and embarrassed look crossing her face as she now held her breath. Ty hadn&#39;t expected this, but it was an intriguing option. Maybe he could date Jill? Maybe the two of them could become adults? Maybe they could become an adult couple with Becca or Eileen as their children? All Ty had to do was make a decision.</p>
