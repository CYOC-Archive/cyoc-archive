<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doorway through the painting must’ve been some sort of servants’ passage, as the narrow corridor it lead us looked unkempt. Dust and grime covered the wooden beams along the ceiling, and the light was dim, with only a few candles showing our way. The men held us close together in one tight bunch. So close I could feel the pecs of the burly man behind me against my head, and his manhood against my lower back. The air was thick and humid. <br />
<br />
Part of me was tempted to reach for his bulge and touch it, even just for a moment. Just to make sure I’m not dreaming. But, the sight of a defeated Jimbo brought me to my senses. I needed to stay professional.<br />
<br />
At the end of the corridor was a maze-like collection of rooms. It was too disorientating to keep track, as deeper and deeper into the manor we were led. I didn’t even realise it was night-time until we briskly walked passed a window, showing the moon hiding behind a large cloud. <br />
<br />
Eventually, we stopped at a thick metal door with a small metal bar at eye-level. One of the men opened the door and pushed us through, slamming it shut behind us. The sound of a padlock grinding against the hard surface rattled in our ears. The force of the shove would’ve sent my head smashing into the stone floor, but someone had caught me at the very last second. I felt two palms pressed firmly against my chest, pushing me back up to my feet. <br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” a soft voice spoke to me.<br />
<br />
I looked up and almost fell in surprise; it was Arthur Rosely, the missing agent!<br />
<br />
I couldn’t believe I actually found him. He was as handsome as in his photos, and tall too! His eyes sparkled in the candlelight, but his face was littered with patches of motor oil. He wore a tight white vest stained black, and his toned arms matched his face. His arms were bigger than what I was expecting, especially his biceps. The top half of his blue coveralls were tied around his waist. Still, I knew that was him. I had swooned over his photo in the report enough times. I simply looked back at him, stunned.<br />
<br />
That was when I realised the walls and ceiling were made entirely of glass, like a greenhouse. The room stuck out from the rest of the manor, surrounded by complete darkness. I hate the dark, and I think Arthur could tell.<br />
<br />
“Hey. Are you okay?” he repeated.<br />
<br />
I just nodded, my eyes fixed on the outside. I had never felt so vulnerable. My eyes shifted to Jimbo, who had moved to sit on a bed with his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
“It’s hopeless…hopeless…” he muttered to himself. Arthur was quick to console him, approaching and wrapping his arms around his shoulders, patting him gently.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright. We’re still alive. The next escape plan will work.”<br />
“Will it Reg? Will it?!” Jimbo spoke sharply, with a tone shaken by despair. <br />
<br />
Arthur must be using a fake name. Jimbo pushed him away and stood up in a huff.<br />
<br />
“It’s hopeless! We’ve tried everything and nothing’s worked. We’re never getting out of here, and now look what they did to me!”<br />
<br />
He thrusted just crotch close to Arthur’s face, his grown member bulging out. Jimbo pointed to it.<br />
<br />
“Now they’ve given me something…”<br />
<br />
“Something?” Arthur looked up at the boy, “what did they give you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know! But it’s made…it’s…I don’t want to talk about it! Just leave me alone!”<br />
<br />
Jimbo yelled as he dropped onto another bed and crawled under the covers, his scraggly brown hair poking out. He cried quietly to himself. Arthur sighed.<br />
<br />
“Poor kid,” he whispered to me. I immediately took him to the far corner furthest from Jimbo, just out of earshot.<br />
<br />
“Arthur!” I almost yelled it from sheer excitement. Thankfully Jimbo didn’t hear me.<br />
<br />
“Arthur? No, it’s Reggie. I work for Somerset News—“<br />
“It’s okay, I’m part of GTT too! I’m here to get you out of here, and work out wherever the hell is going on!”<br />
<br />
Arthur laughed, relieved. He pulled me in and hugged me tightly. His armpit hair tickled my shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Thank God, we’re gonna get out of here!” he said, “so, what’s the plan? Helicopter? Ooh! A squad on the roof are gonna abseil down?”<br />
“Uhhh, not quite…”<br />
“You must be one of our best agents then, to come and save me. I knew GTT wouldn’t abandon me!”<br />
<br />
His hug tightened. A waft of his musk filled my nose. I was in heaven.<br />
<br />
“Yep, one of the best!” I lied, hoping the hug would never end. The moon stretched out from behind the clouds and illuminated the outside around us. It looked like a well-kept garden with neatly-trimmed bushes and colourful displays of flowers. I felt more at ease, Arthur eventually broke the hug.<br />
<br />
“So when is the backup team getting here?”<br />
“They’re not.”<br />
<br />
His smile dissipated in a flash.<br />
<br />
“Gosh,” he said, “so we’re on our own?”<br />
“Well, what leads do you have?”<br />
<br />
He fell silent, staring at the floor. After a moment he took a deep breath in.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” he said bluntly.<br />
“Nothing?!”<br />
“Nothing. I was captured, same as you, and was taken here. They gave me the job of looking after the boiler in the basement, with a few oddjobs outside. All I know is that Lord Locksteed is at the heart of it all. But I’ve got nothing on how these guys got so big, or what Lord Locksteed’s plan is with them. What did they give Jim?”<br />
<br />
I quickly explained the events that took place in the dining room. After I finished he took a deep breath in and gently put his hands together. <br />
<br />
“Right, I think we should talk to the boy. He knows more than he’s letting on.”<br />
“Good idea!” I said keenly. Arthur gave me a strange look, as if he was taken aback by my eagerness. I knew I needed to tone it down, just a smidge.<br />
<br />
However just as we turned around, Jimbo’s bed began to shake, the frame clattering against the stone floor. Jimbo was completely shrouded by the bed covers, But it looked as if he was on his side, facing away from us. Then, the shape underneath the covers was getting bigger, filling up more of the bed. Jimbo began to glow a vibrant blue, which bled through the covers.<br />
<br />
I went to pull the covers off him but Arthur slapped my hand away.<br />
<br />
“You know the protocol; Distance, Check, Control. Keep your distance.”<br />
“Right yes…the protocol…I knew that,” I lied. We both took a step back.<br />
<br />
The shaking became more vigorous. His body was taking up more space on the bed, still growing, but we couldn’t see under the covers. All we could do was watch very cautiously as the shape got bigger and bigger.<br />
<br />
“Jimbo, are you okay?” Arthur called out.<br />
<br />
Jimbo groaned. His voice was soft, but deeper. The shaking of the bed became more vigorous. He uncurled his body and stretched his legs out. His feet peeked out from under the covers and dangled off the edge of the bed. I noticed some hair slowly sprout along his toes. After another growth spurt, more of his legs were exposed, as if he had gotten taller. His loose trousers looked more filled in, and could barely reach past his ankles. His messy hair that poked out was darkening into a jet black. The covers rose and fell with his breathing.<br />
<br />
“Tell us what’s causing this Jim.”<br />
“I can’t…stop.”<br />
<br />
His body grew again. The bed looked like it was straining under his weight, and I could see the outline of a bulging muscley arm through the covers. Arthur stood in front of me and clenched his fists.<br />
<br />
“Jim, tell us what is going on here, now.”<br />
“I…Ohhh…”<br />
<br />
He grew again. 7ft. Just like the men.<br />
<br />
“Jimbo!”<br />
“OH GOD! HELP ME!”<br />
<br />
Jimbo suddenly tossed the covers off him and turned to lay on his back. He was now a tall, thick wall of muscle. The shirt he was wearing had torn in half, allowing his pecs to push through. His face was the same, still with those boyish features and that permanent expression of fear. It didn’t match the godlike physique he now possessed. The blue glow around him grew more intense.<br />
<br />
However, what caught our eyes first was the 2ft-long dick that stuck up from his hips, rock hard. His hands had gripped the length and he was practically thrusting his entire body into them. His member was so thick, even with hands as big as his were he couldn’t fully grasp it. The bed shook with each thrust, until the legs finally gave in and bent under the weight. Jimbo didn’t even notice the bed collapsing to the ground; his mind was enraptured by the pleasure the growth was no doubt providing. Arthur held his arm out in front of me, pushing me back slightly.<br />
<br />
“Shit. He’s too far gone,” Arthur said bitterly.<br />
<br />
We could tell he was getting close, as his thrusts quickened along with his breathing. We jumped back as far away from him as we could in that glass box. Arthur tipped over one of the beds and hopped behind it, ducking. I followed suit. We kept our heads low. All I could hear was Jimbo’s voice, completely unrecognisable from a few moments ago.<br />
<br />
“Fuck I can’t stop it! AH! I’m so big! I don’t….OHHH FUCK!”<br />
<br />
I peeked around the toppled bed to witness the greatest cumshot I had ever seen. It was like a fire hose! An endless stream of white blasting to the glass ceiling above him. As it splattered the surface, it flew straight back down onto him, like a waterfall. Arthur pulled my head back behind cover just as a spurt of rogue seed flew past my face, hitting the wall with a tremendous force. <br />
<br />
When it was all over, we popped our heads over the bed to take the scene in. Cum was still dripping from the ceiling onto Jimbo, who lay limp with his thick limbs spread across the comparatively tiny bed. He bathed in a puddle of his seed. His cock was beginning to soften, but was still huge. Arthur bravely stood up and took a step closer. He held his hands out, not to touch Jimbo but rather to make sure he kept his distance.<br />
<br />
“Jim? Are you there?”<br />
<br />
Jimbo slowly turned his head to face us. He was out of breath, and wiped some of his semen away from his mouth to speak.<br />
<br />
“Yeah…I’m good…I’m-“<br />
<br />
Jimbo suddenly yelped as he sat up on the bed, a river of semen flowing off his abs. He clutched his face. <br />
<br />
“No! Not like this!  I don’t want to become like them!”<br />
<br />
I saw stubble sprout on the part of his jaw he wasn’t covering. Then it sort of shifted, like the bone structure of his face was physically moving and expanding. He kept his face covered.<br />
<br />
“I don’t…I’m a baker. My name is…My name…is…”<br />
<br />
He slowly put his hands down and I could see a wave of defeat completely erase any hope Arthur had left. Jimbo no longer had a boyish face. Rather, it now fit his newly acquired body; incredibly handsome with a thick neck and facial hair. He still looked like him, but like a much more manly version of him. His expression was blank, emotionless, as he simply stared off into the distance.<br />
<br />
Then, he calmly rose to his feet and approached the door. He knocked three times. The door swiftly opened and one of the men that escorted us was on the other side. They were the same height. The man held out his hand to Jimbo, who held his out too, and was gently led out of the door. I tried to see which direction they went, but another man blocked the doorway. He was holding a neatly folded piled of clothes. He slowly placed them by the foot of the door and slammed it shut. There was an envelope on the pile. As Arthur unfolded the clothes, it looked to be a pair of dungarees and a white cotton shirt. He opened the envelope, revealing a small piece of expensive-looking parchment. He read it, and then handed it to me.<br />
<br />
“It’s for you.”<br />
<br />
The parchment read:<br />
<br />
GET PLENTY OF REST, GARDENER. TOMORROW IS YOUR ORIENTATION X<br />
<br />
Arthur pushed the toppled bed back up and sat on it, wiping a patch of motor oil from his forearm. His gaze was fixed on me.<br />
<br />
“Shit, I didn’t tell you about orientation.”</p>
