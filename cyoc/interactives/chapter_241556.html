<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer tried her best to sleep peacefully but something inside her refused to let her do so. Her imagination was becoming too vivid and in Jennifer’s half-awaken state she lay on the bed when something happened to her. She was now in the school’s locker room. In front of her was the rabbit boy who she saw today. The anthropomorphic rabbit approached Jennifer an put his own paw around Jennifer’s paw and then out of nowhere they begun intensely kissing each other. Jennifer was mesmerized by rabbit’s actions and both of them exchanged saliva together.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer. I hope your plan works if we do this…” The white dream rabbit kept pushing her tongue deeper into her throat.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had no idea what was happening but in seconds she was down on her four getting six inch rabbit cock deep inside her raccoon vagina. The dream had turned into a nightmare as Jennifer moaned. The dream hopped all over the place where she was on top of the toilet and then Jennifer saw her belly expanding rapidly. The next moment she was back at the school locker room getting fucked by the white rabbit while her pudgy belly swayed up and down. Jennifer gasped how her belly was growing and expanding. Jennifer let out a loud moan out of her mouth and saw that she was sleeping on top of her bed.<br />
<br />
Thankfully all that was just a dream what she had.<br />
<br />
The morning sun greeted Jennifer and felt a small kick hitting her stomach. What felt even weirder was the fact that the kick came inside her. Jennifer lifted the blanket with force from top of her and screamed when she saw her pregnant raccoon belly.<br />
<br />
“Ohm mah gawd. I’m like totally all preggos!” Jennifer gasped and noticed her odd speech pattern. “Why dew I sound like-ah stupid bim-bow? Ohm mah gawd. Diz can&#39;t bee totally what I sound like for realsies. GAAH! Like ohm em gee. What’s wrong with meeh? Why can&#39;t I like speak normally anymore?”<br />
<br />
Jennifer quickly jumped from the bed to the floor. Jennifer rushed in front of the full body mirror to see what had happened to her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped and almost screamed when she saw her own reflection from the mirror. The curse had made Jennifer into a pregnant bimbo. For a seventeen year old teenager her breasts now looked way too big and the belly made the figure look like a hourglass while a pillow was taped on her furry raccoon belly. Jennifer went quickly to see what type of clothing she had to wear and noticed that all her shirt and skirts were now more revealing than she wanted them to be. The first t-shirt showed her belly and a bit of the underboob while the skirt was able to displayed her underwear as none of the skirts went past her thighs. <br />
<br />
Jennifer wondered if it was a punishment for messing with the curse or did her lustful action cause her more trouble. She had no clue what had caused all this to happen to her.<br />
<br />
“Like, I haf to have a talk with Kyle for realsies. Like. Do I look pretty enough for him? Like, I don’t know. I kinda look pretty sexy with mah new shirt and stuff.” Jennifer pushed her boobs together and licked her lips in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had hard time controlling her body as it either wanted to have sex, be sexy or think about sex. Jennifer felt like as if she was her body’s moral compass at this point. A puppeteer trying it’s best to steer her body to the right direction.<br />
<br />
After carefully picking and choosing the best outfit from the pile of trashy ones. Jennifer settled with a t-shirt that acted as a crop top which kept her furry underboobs hidden most of the time. Jennifer found pair of tight jeans and made her big butt look even bigger. This way she didn’t have to worry about showing her underwear which were all too sexy or revealing for the school. She looked at herself from the mirror and looked like character straight out of a white trash reality TV series. It was the best clothes she could have picked for herself as rest were more revealing or too trashy for school. Jennifer exited her room and walked downstairs. Jennifer was surprised that her mother looked more normal than Jennifer did. Was Jennifer the only one who had changed. How was that even possible?<br />
<br />
“Like, morning ma!” Jennifer greeted her mother.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer. Come sit to the table. I need to have a talk with you.” Chloe said to Jennifer.<br />
<br />
“Wassup?” Jennifer casually asked.<br />
<br />
“I heard a rumor from my friend’s friend that you’ve had your first beer when you were hanging with Kyle yesterday.” Chloe said and rubbed her temple.<br />
<br />
“Ha!? No way…” Jennifer’s replied back as she run her tongue through her mouth and tasted something weird in her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Yes way. That Kyle-boy has changed you and I want you to stop dating him even if you’ve already had sex and well, that belly might pop it’s mini-Jennifer anytime soon.” Chloe continued and looked down at Jennifer’s pregnant belly. “Try to be gentle and tell him that you can’t see each other anymore. I don’t want you to grow up as a burden to the society. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do with you if you continue hanging out with that boy.”<br />
<br />
“Right, ma. I try.” Jennifer said to her mom.<br />
<br />
Jennifer knew that she was lying to her mother but her body wasn’t sending any signals of shame to her brain. Had Jennifer become a pathological liar that didn’t feel any type of shame when she said those words to her own mother. What was Jennifer future going to look like if she grew up like this?</p>
