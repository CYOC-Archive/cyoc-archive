<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dapple was a first generation offspring of Tom-tom and Lisa; a hyper intelligent rat the size of a large Labrador dog. Like the rest of the first generation rats she too had inherited some unusual traits from her once human mother. Along with an almost human level intelligence, if more animalistic and direct, she also had ore dextrous paws, which made manipulation of objects simpler. Her frame too was slightly different, built to be able to stand back on her haunches more simply, giving her a slightly more upright stature.  She was, however, of their newest brood to mature, only recently grown into her body and new to the world.<br />
<br />
Only two weeks old, yet fully grown, she had spent her first days being suckled by her broodmother. The next week and a half, she spent cleaning and watching over the pregnant queen of the den, alongside her litter-mates. That was until the change.<br />
<br />
As expedited adulthood came over her and her litter mates, a flood of new hormones coursed through their bodies. Most of her brood, at home in the den, fell to their kin for relief; mounting each other or being mounted in turn. Some males even turned to the behemoth of their broodmother, while others were impregnated in turn by their sire Tom Tom. But Dapple was different. She wanted something else. Something she’d seen on her last foray to the lake.<br />
<br />
Out with her elder sibling Nipper, foraging, they had both come across the humans camping at the lake. While Nipper had scampered back to inform and impress her beloved sire at their finding, Dapple had stayed behind to watch them.<br />
<br />
And watch them she did. Something about them struck her, or, at least something about one of them did. The large hairless one appealed to her. He looked virile, and strong. Well built. For hours she’d watched them interacting. Watched chatter in their strange language. Watched them stare at little square objects, and watched them breed.<br />
<br />
That was what she enjoyed the most. The big hairless one was a monster, bigger even that her sire, Tom Tom. And as hormones flooded her for the first time, telling her to breed, it was this creature she beheld. <br />
<br />
While she watched Nipper get fucked and impregnated by her father, it was her and the hairless one she imagined. She knew she had to have him.<br />
<br />
Following them down the woods she’d seen them both climb into a strange moving box, and had hidden herself on it’s back, under a tarp. There she’d stayed until it stopped and she smelled the big one leave.<br />
<br />
His scent took her to a large stone cave with flat walls. And see through walls. She couldn’t work out where he’d gone, so instead cased the house from the bushes.<br />
<br />
There she stayed for many hours. Impatiently waiting for him to return. Which he didn’t. What she did observe, however, was other hairless rats walking into and out of the flat caves by pushing on flat, strangely coloured wood. Figuring this cave must work the same, Dapple bounded up the path and tried the same. Pushing and scrabbling at the door.<br />
<br />
She was at it for some time and was about to give up when her ears twitched. Movement! Movement inside, and there was the scent. The big hairless one.<br />
<br />
As she heard the flat wood being scrabbled at from the other side she stood back. Waiting for it to open.<br />
<br />
The moment came seconds later as it opened and the sight of Ramon appeared in front of Dapple, making her chitter in excitement.<br />
<br />
For Ramon though, the sight of a three foot tall, halfling rat creature haunches at his door made him start and leave out a strangled cry.<br />
<br />
Dapple, not wanting to scare her intended mate did what she’d been watching him and the other one do all day, she stood on her legs and chittered at him, head tilting.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!?” Ramon gasped talking a big step back, panicking away from the door. The rat thing was on it’s legs now, standing quite upright, talking to him. Chittering and squeaking non-stop… wait… talking to him???<br />
<br />
He paused… rats don’t talk. This thing was still tilting her head from side to side, talking like mad. It dropped and skipped forward half a step before standing again. A she, definitely a she. Eight pink nipples running down a furry chest. Still talking. What!?<br />
<br />
Furry thighs, furry chest. Eight nipples.<br />
<br />
Eight nipples… furry thighs ...Oh  fuck… no way<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck… <br />
…Gina?”<br />
<br />
The rat stopped chittering then for a moment tilting it’s head again. Dapple knew that the hairless ones took turns in squeaking at each other, and from observations picked out the tones that indicated when one was finished and the other was to begin. Happy to be getting it right she squeaked in excitement and spun in a circle, on all fours.<br />
<br />
Ramon, taking this as an affirmative took a step back aghast, and stumbled, falling hard onto his ass.<br />
<br />
Dapple squeaked and rushed to his side as he fell, then pausing and looking him in the eye.<br />
<br />
Their gaze held a long moment, Ramon’s panicked breathing slowing eventually.<br />
<br />
“Gina babe… the hair.. the nipples. This was it wasn’t it. Some weird werewolf… wererat thing. Why didn’t you tell me?”.<br />
<br />
Dapple was happy, she was picking this up quickly. How he squeaked. It was her turn again. Their mating dance was going well. So she stood again. Chittering, this time sticking out her fuzzy chest, showing all her teats; how many she had all to feed offspring with. Then she dropped and spun, showing her rear, tail whipping side to side, to spread her scent. She looked over her shoulder and squeaked softly.<br />
<br />
“Dios mio, Gina… why are you excited. You look happy for God’s sake. Like you like this?” his hand extended, shaking. Dapple, taking it as a sign raised her tail, showing of her burning slit.<br />
<br />
Ramon recoiled for a moment, the got to kneeling, put his arms on Dapples shoulders, and with no effort but infinite strength simply picked her up placed her standing in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Gina!” he growled. Dapple shook in sexual excitement, how strong the hairless one was, she longed for his seed.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what’s gotten into you, or what has happened. But snap out of it! I want you to come back!”. He pleaded.<br />
<br />
Dapple felt his arms on her, turning she licked them, licked his scent off them. Neither knew it, but bodily fluid were the mechanism by which Lisa had set up TomTom’s ability to morph and change. A trait he passed to his offspring.<br />
<br />
As soon as what he though was Gina licked his bare arms, Ramon felt a hot flush go through him. His cheeks blushed and his heart rate increased.<br />
<br />
“Gina…”, he let go and scooted back. Dapple stayed standing on powerful hind legs. She was tall, over three foot off fur and oozing heat. All eight of her pink teats were puffed with hard tips, and the fur around her pussy was slick with juices. This too, was the first time Ramon took notice of the smell. The smell of female rat in the depths of heat.<br />
<br />
Had he not already been to the lake several times and be exposed to rat mutagen he would no doubt have found it repulsive, but already slightly changed, his brain was now wired differently. Receptivity to sexual hormones was the first part of Lisa’s changes, which again travelled to her offspring.<br />
<br />
Ramon inhaled deeply as the cloying muskiness hit his nostrils. Eyes rolling and eyelids fluttering he sighed contentedly. “Dios Mio Gina… you smell…”. Ramon’s stomach got a shot of adrenalin, blood pressure spiking, and blood beginning to pulse to his crotch.<br />
<br />
Dapple, for her part, noticed his flushing cheeks and sniffed the air, recognising the beginnings of his receptivity. Her pussy convulsed in excitement making a wet *splap* sound as a clear dribble of ratty vaginal juices rolled down her slit and dripped to the floor.<br />
<br />
The waft of sex rolled down the corridor, striking Ramon, instantly taking him back to the smell of the hotboxed sex tent he’d shared with Gina only the night before. The smell hung for a moment, entrancing, until a breeze of cool clear air from outside blew along the corridor and pulled Ramon back enough to speak. Eyes glazed and mouth watering he croaked out, “ I don’t know what’s going on with ‘chu babe, but you better come in”. Ramon gestured into the bowels of the house. <br />
<br />
Dapple paused and smelled the air, and looked where he gestured. There was a strong smell of her mate coming from where he was pointing. With a twitching nose and whiskers she scampered to the source, bounding through rooms like the cave she was born in, until she found his nest, the source of the scent. Spinning on the soft nest a few times she turned and waited for her hairless mate to arrive.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily and staggering, Ramon appeared at the doorway, cock tenting his underwear, balls churning. His mind was addled, his changed receptors fully picking up Dapples heat. All reason and inhibition centres in his mind were bypassed, and all pleasure centres maxed out; he was wired to want to breed with anything that smelled like Dapple.</p>
