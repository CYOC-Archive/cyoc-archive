<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas saw a scared elephant running directly to him followed by a variety of other animals, like tigers, bisons, boars or even ostriches. They&#39;re completely in panic and getting close to Thomas and Cody so fast. He had the feeling he was able to run enough fast to avoid them, but he can&#39;t do that if he had Cody on his shoulders, but he can&#39;t let the little boy behind either. He needed to think in a way to solve that problem quickly.<br />
<br />
He was desperately thinking when he saw his brother next to him, ready to do any command his little brother gave him. In front of them was the high school, too close and now too long at the same time. A few days back it was the scariest place he knew but now it seems their only salvation. Those trees in front of the school looked like old grumpy men with those long branches around them. That&#39;s it! The branches! He had an idea now, but he needed his brother help to make it work.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, I have an idea. Run to those trees and wait for my indications!&quot; Thomas said. George nodded and he ran very fast toward the trees. &quot;Cody, I&#39;m sorry for what I&#39;m going to do but it&#39;s the best way to keep you safe right now. I hope you&#39;re ready because you&#39;re going to fly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see them, Momo?&quot; Loki said as he was watching through his window. &quot;There are some people over there! They&#39;re in the stampede&#39;s direction. Maybe they will be stomped! Ha ha ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki was excited of how fast the animals were getting closer to Thomas, Cody and George. They looked shocked and freezed on their place. Almost as if they were disposed to be crashed by the stampede.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Let&#39;s see what will happen!&quot; Loki said so excited. &quot;Just wait! In three... two... one... Uh? What is he doing?&quot; He watched carefully at the scene and he saw how the dog ran to the building leaving the humans, but a second later, the older human threw the small human to the tree like if he was a football. &quot;How he can do that? A regular human can&#39;t be so strong!... Maybe, he is from that school... It doesn&#39;t matter that&#39;s not normal!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki was completely surprised of what he saw. The small human flew in the air until he fell on the trees, the boy get hurt as he was falling through the branches but it wasn&#39;t as bad as being smash by those animals. George was completely surprised too of what his brother was able to do, but he reacted quickly and catched Cody over his back. Then, the little boy fell on the ground as he was shocked of his experience, apparently he fainted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was unbelievable! But...&quot; Loki saw how the stampede was too close to Thomas. &quot;He won&#39;t be as lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
George saw how close the stampede was to his brother and he knew that despite his new strength he won&#39;t be enough fast. Desperately, he ran back to his brother. It looked like they both will go to get crushed, but a mysterious flash covered them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! You&#39;ve impressed me, boys!&quot; Loki said to the brothers who had appeared on his throne room. &quot;You&#39;ve courage and I like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Where? Who?&quot; Thomas said as he recovered from the shock he had. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Loki! The trickster god! And welcome to my funhouse!&quot; He said proudly. George who had heard something about Loki before, knew he wasn&#39;t a good person and he began to bark him. That annoyed Loki very fast. &quot;Shut up! Stupid human dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute.&quot; Thomas said. &quot;How do you now he&#39;s human and not a regular dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m the one who turned the males in this town into animals. I know who is under my magic at any moment&quot; Loki said as he returned to his throne.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bastard!&quot; Thomas said angrily. He felt a rush of adrenaline which moved him to try to punch Loki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, calm down!&quot; Loki said and Thomas freezed in his position like if he was a statue. &quot;I don&#39;t bring you here to be treated rude! I want some fun and as I saw your little performance over there, I thought you could be the toys I&#39;m looking for. Don&#39;t you think so, Momo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Momo?&quot; Thomas said. He was able to speak even if he can&#39;t move himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my pet ape.&quot; Loki said. &quot;It&#39;s there on that cage, he used to be a DJ, but he was rude with me and now he is my loyal pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sick!&quot; Thomas yelled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... I think you haven&#39;t understood what I&#39;d said.&quot; Loki said with an serious tone. &quot;Don&#39;t you realize I can do anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki&#39;s eyes shined and Thomas saw how his fist turned big and hairy, he felt his body changing, getting bigger and bigger very quickly. George watched in amazement how his brother turned from human to gorilla in a second. He was still frozen, but now he was a massive animal. Thomas tried to yell at Loki but he made a loud roar instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see it?&quot; Loki said. &quot;I can do anything!&quot; He snapped his fingers and Thomas was able to move again, he was scared of his new form as he looked at his huge arms, his weird feet and his barrel chest. Meanwhile, George began to bark again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you shut up!&quot; Loki said and in that moment, George turned from a dog to a toad. &quot;Much better!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scared brothers ran to each other as fast as they can in their new forms. Loki was laughing uncontrolable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you&#39;ll be good toys! You just need a little bit of education like any pet! Ha ha ha ha ha&quot; Loki said. &quot;But I&#39;m not too interested into turning you into animals. I&#39;d enough with the zoo outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki snapped his fingers and the ape and the toad turned to humans. Now Thomas and George were nude hugging each other. They looked as they were before anything begins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh? Are you lovers? Friends?&quot; Loki said. &quot;You&#39;re too close each other&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re brothers!&quot; George yelled. &quot;And I love my family, demon!&quot; Thomas was happy that George has returned to normal, he won&#39;t need to be the strong man anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brothers?&quot; Loki said. &quot;I can see that. You have the same horns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Horns?&quot; Thomas said and he touched his head. He realized he had horns on there, but before he was able to do anything, he inmediately turned into a bull, his brother turned too and now there was two bulls in front of Loki.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d wondered how similar brother could be...&quot; Loki said as he get closer to the new bovines. &quot;Me and my brothers aren&#39;t too close and I have always wished to compare my dick with them, specially Thor, who thinks it&#39;s the alpha male in the family! So, my pets. Are you disposed to help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He used his hands to crush each guy testicles at the same time. The boys wanted to kick him, but Loki magic made them to just moan loudly instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both have big balls. I can&#39;t note if any of you is bigger.&quot; Loki said. &quot;Unfold sheaths!&quot; George and Thomas felt how his new appendages came out from their animal sheaths. Loki touched both genitals, measured them and even he licked them. &quot;It&#39;s the same here too. I think I was right all this time but I need to be sure before...&quot; Loki made a stop and then he yelled. &quot;Shoot!&quot;<br />
<br />
Without any control, both brothers cummed their bull seeds. The loads fell close to Momo who used his ape hands to touch and lick them a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Momo! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; Loki said. &quot;Uhm... I think I&#39;ll need another samples...&quot; He made a circle with his hands and George and Thomas felt how his new bull balls were making more semen inside them. &quot;Guys, I want to see your bests! Shot!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bulls ejaculated again but now their loads fell far from Momo, the amount was bigger than before and the color was a little bit more yellow, animalish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much better, boys!&quot; Loki said and he got close to the cum. &quot;I can&#39;t see a difference. So, I was right all this time! I&#39;m as alpha as Thor! He will know me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki vanished in the air, leaving the bulls and the gorilla alone in his throne room.</p>
