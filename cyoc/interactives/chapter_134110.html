<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wake up...&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig moved an ear towards the sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
All was still vague. He was woken up by a girl&#39;s voice, and someone nudging his shoulder. He opened his eyes. Tilting his head up, he saw a girl, a curly redhead, kneeling above him. He groaned slightly, trying to get a sense on what happened. Why did it smell like a farm around here?<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot; Craig asked between groans, to nobody in particular. The girl answered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re at my farm. I was wondering what you were doing here in the stables, centaur boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it is only meant for horses. Get up, I&#39;ll bring you to the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was silent for a moment. Her eyes lit up, as though she&#39;d realized something. &quot;You&#39;re not kidding...&quot;<br />
<br />
A mass moved behind her, two strong legs seemed to stand up, although there was nobody on top of it. The mass was followed suit by the girl herself, who stood up as well, but something was wrong, out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
Something really didn&#39;t add up to what Craig saw. The gorgeous redhead wasn&#39;t clothed properly. She had a cloth on for her top half, functioning as a shirt, but her lower half was bare. And it was not normal. Below her navel, brown hairs sprouted, only to cover her legs completely. The legs were muscled, and got increasingly thinner the more he looked down, until they ended in two black hooves, one on each legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Craig muttered under his breath.<br />
<br />
The abnormal sight in front of him didn&#39;t stop there. Where her behind should have ended, she was instead connected to the mass he thought was moving by itself. Two more legs, as muscled and furry as the front pair, and a tail the colour of the girl&#39;s hair sprouting from behind it. A centaur...<br />
<br />
She stuck out her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said with a wide smile, &quot;I am no monster. In fact, right now, you&#39;re the same as me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Craig asked, as he grabbed a hold of her hand, tried standing up himself.<br />
<br />
The act of standing up, his movements, they seemed out of place. While he was still down on the ground, he felt like his legs were already standing. They had rocketed upwards at the slightest signal. Only then, his own legs followed. Once he stood on both his legs, he saw what was wrong with him.<br />
<br />
He had already noticed his bare chest beforehand, but what was below that was new to him. He lifted his right leg and tried to look at the soles of his feet, only to find out his muscles and bones didn&#39;t move the way he expected them to, nor did it feel unnatural. He bent over, and felt his spine move as if it was only his neck. When he looked down, he found that his legs, too, had brown fur, and ended in hooves. Behind him, a large mass showed, the body of a horse, with at his... hips, two more limbs functioning as legs attached. At the end of his spine, he saw a tail of horse hairs lazily swaying to and fro.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; Craig exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy right?&quot;<br />
<br />
He ignored the girl&#39;s question, as he tested all of the muscles he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a horse, no, I&#39;m a fucking centaur!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just like you picked it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig fell silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;You selected the centaur character from the game, didn&#39;t you?&quot; The girl asked the question differently this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;How... how do you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I made the same mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
She walked around Craig, examining his new form. Here and there a muscle twitched on his equine lower body, as he was still testing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But look at you...&quot; The redhead said, after a while, &quot;haven&#39;t you made quite the upgrade?&quot; She stroked the fur on his back, no, on the horse back, and moved over to his upper body, inspecting, and feeling his abs. Her slender fingers rubbed over his skin. The sensation was arousing, and Craig was captivated by her eyes. The expression she wore betrayed her lust.<br />
<br />
Craig felt blood flow towards his equine crotch, and expected an enlarged appendage to grow out further and stiffen. That sensation didn&#39;t come though, despite his arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, stable boy?&quot; The girl whispered in his ear. &quot;You can&#39;t feel you shaft? Did you forget to specify your gender, just... like... me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her breathing was ragged, as she faced Craig, to kiss him on the lips. He couldn&#39;t speak, overwhelmed by new sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t you lift that cursed tail for me? It&#39;ll only get in my way otherwise...&quot;<br />
<br />
Was she sprouting nonsense? Was she even thinking in this situation? Craig wasn&#39;t thinking properly either. All this time, his crotch was on fire, impatiently awaiting a visit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woman, explain this to me.&quot; Craig said. His own breathing shook as well. Large muscles inside him spasmed randomly. He knew he was horny, but found the circumstances unfit to jump the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally, I am no woman, you see.&quot; She answered him mysteriously. &quot;And you&#39;re no man, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took a step back, and turned her body sideways. Her legs stood vastly on the ground, the hooves were slowly sinking in the mud. A couple of steps, and all four of them got out again. She walked around him once more, so he could have a full view of her. A new sight shocked him. A large, black appendage hung below her body. It was stiff and stood erect, going up and down in as she excitedly twitched her enlarged cock&#39;s muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a fucking cock.&quot; Craig confirmed.<br />
<br />
The woman took off the cloth she wore to cover her chest, only to show two large breasts to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;These two as well. Even among centaurs, you could see me as an abomination.&quot; The redhead said.<br />
<br />
She walked, no, trotted towards him. Hugging him, her breasts, and stiffened nipples, squished against his abs. &quot;Unfortunately for you, the same thing&#39;s the case. You should have specified your gender...&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig stood still, as the girl moved a hand over his back, along the equine back, to where his tail began. She grabbed the loose strands of hair, and thus lifted his tail. More muscles spasmed within him, his crotch started burning more, and just as pleasantly.<br />
<br />
A finger touched his crotch, and moved around and over it. He felt it circle his asshole, and then move down slightly. Another finger joined in, and they both tugged his skin. Looking behind him, Craig saw how she slowly moved a hand to it.<br />
<br />
His muscles tensed completely, as the hand moved into him, followed by half an arm, perhaps even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck...&quot; He said between gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is your little penis, huh?&quot; The redhead said. &quot;I don&#39;t see it.&quot; She followed it up with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
She thrust inside of him, his muscles contracted every time she brought her arm deep into him again, only to relax as she got it out, with the necessary effort.<br />
<br />
The contractions continued even as her arm was fully out of him, although it didn&#39;t feel as a full-blown orgasm. The girl now stood directly behind him, holding his equine behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall I get you one, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig saw her whole stature rise, as a large weight fell upon his hind legs. With an effort, his whole back was now overshadowed by the animalistic woman on top of him. Her appendage was right at his entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready for this. It is a first for the both of us, but it feels so right.&quot;<br />
<br />
She brought her equine cock inside him, with jerks and twists, it shocked in and out of him. His muscles jerked, but his legs wouldn&#39;t fall under the impressive weight of the woman&#39;s incredibly centaur body. For extra grip, she&#39;d grabbed him by his human middle, as he realized this was how it felt like to be ridden by someone. Craig kept silent with the utmost effort and clenched jaws, but the woman didn&#39;t feel ashamed about occasionally letting a moan or a bestial groan escape her lips.<br />
<br />
Craig&#39;s muscles, all over his unfamiliar body, tensed, when the contractions deep within him started to increase and strengthen in force and pleasure. It went on like this, until he reached a peak in what he realized happened to be an orgasm. The girl kept riding him, not indicating she&#39;d stop anytime, until an explosion erupted inside of him.<br />
<br />
A warm liquid was absorbed by his insides, as she felt the girl&#39;s muscles jerk and spasm. Her grip around his middle seemed to strengthen as well, until after about ten seconds, her breathing calmed down again.<br />
<br />
The girl came to stand next to him, cheeks flushed. Craig&#39;s cheeks felt like they were burning up as well. The girl turned to him to give him a passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Was all that she said.<br />
<br />
She picked up the rag she considered a shirt from the muddy ground, and trotted to the farm house in the background. The hips of her equine body swayed just like a woman&#39;s, and he wondered if it was a trait all creatures with large butts shared. The redhead motioned him to follow her, and so he walked, an all four legs, for the first time. He&#39;d become a centaur, for fuck&#39;s sake...</p>
