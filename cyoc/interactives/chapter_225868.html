<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Penny wakes up, still cuddling with Emma. She smirks to herself, taking in the nerdy girl&#39;s cute snoring. Penny savors the sight of the Emma sleeping so peacefully as she gently strokes the nerdy girl&#39;s hair. Emma is in a deep sleep, too far gone to notice her gentle movements. She plants a soft kiss on Emma&#39;s cheek as the nerdy girl continues to sleep. Penny slowly slides off the bed, trying to make as little noise as possible. <br />
Jeff, still trapped in Penny&#39;s pussy, slowly awakes as well. He hears the gentle rustling as Penny begins to get ready, pulling her clothes back on and adjusting her hair in the mirror. His senses begin to come alive, he can smell her perfume, he can see her in the mirror. She&#39;s so beautiful, so perfect, and yet he can&#39;t help but think of Emma, and what Penny did to her last night. <br />
Penny is getting ready to go, she grabs her bag and quietly leaves, being careful to not wake Emma, the nerdy girl sleeping so soundly. As she walks through the house, she notices a strange device sitting on the bookshelf, an unusual thing, something she hadn&#39;t noticed the night before. A strange device, one that she finds intriguing. She picks up the strange device, looking it over as she tries to make sense of it. She has a strong urge to flick all the switches and find out what it does, but something deep inside tells her she shouldn&#39;t, that this could be something important.<br />
As Penny looks at the strange device, the words &#39;chronivac&#39; stand out. Jeff feels a sudden wave of dread wash over him as he sees Penny examining it. The chronivac! The machine that had trapped him like this in the first place! It still existed, but in this reality it must have been sent to his sister instead.<br />
Penny notices a thin wire trailing from the machine to the nearby computer. Without hesitation, she sits down and turns it on. When it loads up, she&#39;s greeted with a program in the middle of the screen: Chronivac V4. A feeling of unease comes over Penny, but she ignores it, the temptation to try it out too much to resist.<br />
She reads the instructions. There is a warning at the bottom saying &quot;previous data found&quot;. A feeling of dread fills Jeff. The last settings the machine had were set by him before it turned him into a pussy. And if Penny found out...<br />
She chooses to load it up and see the previous data. And on the screen, her own pussy shows up in perfect detail. To the side is a long list of details, and one near the top stands put to her: &quot;SUBJECT: JEFF&quot;. She clicks it, and more details expand out. Jeff, brother of Emma? But Emma didn&#39;t have any siblings... Penny knew that. Then what did this mean? <br />
Penny tries to think this over. Jeff was her brother&#39;s name... but Emma didn&#39;t have a brother... then what did this mean? Penny feels her heart pounding in her chest. Could this machine actually... change reality? Could this mean Emma once did have a brother?<br />
The chronivac had turned Jeff into Penny&#39;s pussy, and she had now inadvertently found out how to change reality itself. She had found Jeff, Emma&#39;s former brother, now her pussy... and that idea made her deeply uncomfortable. Some nasty, perverted boy had merged himself with her most intimate parts, without her consent or knowledge. She didn&#39;t trust this Jeff bastard at all. She looked over the data and options presented to her across the screen. She could undo this, turn him back to normal. Or...<br />
Jeff could barely comprehend what was happening. Penny knew now. She knew who he was. She knew she had the power to change reality.<br />
Penny gulps as a wicked thought enters her head. A smirk comes across her face. Jeff was her pussy, but if she had the power to change reality... then she could change that too. She could change her pussy to not be Jeff. The righteous rage from having somebody violate her privacy in such a bizarre way fueled her thoughts, and she barely hesitated.<br />
She quickly begins typing on the computer, a sense of urgency overtaking her. She inputs new data for her pussy: &quot;SUBJECT: N/A.&quot; No previous data, nothing to mess things up. Her pussy would no longer have a name, it would no longer be a person. Jeff&#39;s existence would be completely erased.<br />
Her fingers hover over the ENTER key as a wave of guilt and shame comes over her. Jeff was Emma&#39;s brother, after all. He didn&#39;t deserve this. She was being too cruel...<br />
But a surge of dark pleasure overcomes her as she realizes she has complete power over Jeff. He can&#39;t stop her. He can&#39;t resist her. She can do anything she wants to him, and he can&#39;t even beg her for mercy. She has complete power over him, and that excites her beyond belief.<br />
Jeff is in utter horror as he sees Penny about to finalize this heartless change, but he knows he can do nothing about it. Penny goes to press ENTER when suddenly Emma wakes up. &quot;Mmm, Penny, what time is it? Wait... what are you doing?&quot;<br />
Penny looks at the screen, her guilt and shame overpowering her wicked lust for power over Jeff. She feels like she can&#39;t do it to Emma. But... she can&#39;t just leave things the way they are. She begins typing on the keyboard once more, adding more data for Jeff, a way to give him more power: &quot;ABILITY: SPEAK.&quot;<br />
The new data for Jeff takes, and he finds his voice has returned to him.<br />
&quot;Please! Penny, stop! You don&#39;t have to do this!&quot;<br />
&quot;Jeff, is that you?&quot; Penny says with surprise, shocked to hear her pussy speak. She looks over her shoulder to see Emma staring at her with confusion. Penny feels her guilt and shame wash over her, knowing she was so close to erasing Jeff completely, but she couldn&#39;t do it, not with Emma watching.<br />
&quot;Yes! It&#39;s me! Jeff! Penny, you can&#39;t erase me like that!&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice is filled with desperation. He&#39;s pleading for his life. Penny can&#39;t believe he can speak, but he sounds terrified. He&#39;s scared of her. She feels her dark pleasure rising in her, but she forces it back down.<br />
&quot;Why did you do this, Jeff? I don&#39;t like the idea of some fucking perv being my pussy without me even knowing.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m not a fucking perv. It was an accident... it was the chronovac.&quot; Jeff says, his voice filled with desperation. &quot;I accidentally hit it and got turned into your pussy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why should I believe you, Jeff?&quot; Penny&#39;s voice is filled with scorn. &quot;How do I know this isn&#39;t just a trick? That you aren&#39;t lying to me? How do I know you&#39;re not just a fucking perv, trying to trick me into something? Huh?&quot; Penny&#39;s voice is filled with anger, with betrayal, but beneath that there is fear. She doesn&#39;t trust Jeff. She doesn&#39;t even know if she should.<br />
Jeff stumbles over his words. He knows how hard this must be for Penny. &quot;I... I&#39;m not. It&#39;s just...&quot; He doesn&#39;t even know where to start. It was all so sudden. So strange. He doesn&#39;t even know how he should feel, but he does know what he feels now. &quot;Penny, you can trust me. I would never hurt you or Emma. I care about the two of you, you have to believe me.&quot; His voice is filled with sincerity and desperation. &quot;Penny, please. You have to believe me.&quot;<br />
Penny hesitates. She&#39;s still not sure if she can trust Jeff. She has no way of knowing if he&#39;s telling the truth, or if he&#39;s just trying to trick her. But... deep down, she wants to believe him. She wants to trust him. <br />
&quot;Jeff... if what you&#39;re saying is true... I have to let you out of here, right?&quot; She doesn&#39;t even know how that works, but she&#39;s trying to find a way to compromise, to figure things out. Jeff realizes his salvation may be coming, if he can convince her. <br />
&quot;Penny, you&#39;re the only one who can change reality with this. Please, just let me out of your pussy, let me have my life again.&quot; <br />
Penny lets out a deep sigh, thinking things over. She still doesn&#39;t know if she can trust Jeff, but she doesn&#39;t know what to do, what the right course of action is.</p>
