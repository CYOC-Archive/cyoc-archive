<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And he decided on Jeffery Parker, Josh&#39;s tech teacher.<br />
<br />
Jeffery was a 55 year old man. He was bald and his hair was white. He had a very rough stubble and an extremely thin layer of white hair on his head. His eyes were a bright blue and his nose was huge. Jeffrey&#39;s voice was also very deep and empowering. He wore grey dress pants and a white dress shirt that always had the sleeves rolled up and he wore long black shoes. He used to be an extremely fit man but nowadays he has a bit of a gut. His ass was so plump aswel which was intriguing to Josh. Jeffery also had very burly and hairy arms as shown when he has his sleeves rolled up and from what Josh could tell, Jeffrey&#39;s legs were thick and burly aswel from when it was non school uniform day and Mr Parker came in with shorts. Jeffrey also seemed to have a decent package as displayed by the small bulge in his dress pants. Mr Parker also almost always walks with such pride in himself. Josh (being bisexual) was kinda into older guys like Jeffrey but Josh couldn&#39;t stop masterbating for a week after going up the Mr Parker&#39;s desk to ask for a pen and seeing that he was fully erect in his grey dress pants and trying to hide it under the desk.<br />
<br />
Josh soon arrived at school and he had 15 minutes before he had to go to his first lesson. He had a plan on how he would do the body stealing spell already and after he bought the spell, the woman told him the activation code and that he had to hold the paper with the spell on it while he said the code.<br />
<br />
Josh stood just outside the main hall of the school and held the spell in his hand and said &quot;goddess of souls, please allow me to assume a spiritual form so that I may posses another body to my liking.&quot; And with that, everything stopped, frozen, just like the spell said it would. Josh walked through the main hall, trying not to touch anybody so he didn&#39;t accidentally slip into there body&#39;s. Josh headed straight for Jeffrey&#39;s office. The reason Jeffrey had his own office was because he was an assistant headteacher. Josh found it in no time and looked though the window on the door to see Jeffery sat at his desk, frozen in time.<br />
<br />
Josh was going to use the handle to open the door but when he reached for it, he faded through the door like a ghost. Josh quickly regained his composure as he walked towards Jeffrey. Once he was close enough, Josh tried to touch Jeffrey&#39;s large should but his hand sunk through and as it did, it felt as if Josh were being pulled inside Jeffrey&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was noise again and Josh was sitting down. He tried to move but he couldn&#39;t as Jeffrey soul fought to get full control back but Josh wouldn&#39;t allow it. They fought inside their head but Jeffrey soon began to loose and in no time he was suppressed by Josh. Suddenly, Josh could move. <br />
<br />
He stood up and he was so much taller than before. He looked down at his burly arms and flexed them a bit. Josh then realised how large and fat his hands were. He then moved those hands to his head to only feel a prickle of the tiniest bit of hair and the he moved down to his stubble with was a bit thicker but a lot rougher than the hair on his head aswel. Then he used his beefy hands to feel his chest and his large gut. Then his hands were drawn to his backside as he began to squeeze his plump ass which triggered an erection in his new pants. His right hand was drawn to rub his erection though his pants while his left hand stayed squeezing his ass.<br />
<br />
Then it hit him all the memories of Jeffrey Parker. Suddenly after this, Josh stopped pleasuring himself and got back to marking his work under the influence of his new memories. &quot;I&#39;ll check myself out properly once I&#39;m home.&quot; Thought Josh as he sat at his teacher desk marking tests and class work.</p>
