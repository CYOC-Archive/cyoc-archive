<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The birthing bed clattered as another contraction rippled through Austin’s body.  “Plee… Not… Not… arrghhh!  Please not again!” she screamed as the rest of the room could do nothing but watch.<br />
<br />
Leon the lion bent down and whispered in Steve’s ear, “Look I know you’re not in good shape right now, but have you recovered enough to look at her?”<br />
<br />
‘No!’ Steve wanted to scream, ‘I want nothing to do with any of you!’  But instead, his body came up with the most submissive, feminine sounding voice that it could and replied with a simple, “Yes master.”<br />
<br />
Just like before, Leon stuck his arm under Steve’s shoulder, gripped down on one of his tender breasts, then lifted Steve into a standing position.  The two walked over to Austin, until Steve was standing in between Austin’s widely spread legs.  From this position, Steve had full access Austin’s sentient cunt, just as the birthing bed was designed to do.  Well, Steve thought to himself, it hadn’t been built to give access to a *sentient* cunt but… here he was. <br />
<br />
Steve wasn’t really sure what he should do.  All of the pregnancy and birth porn that he’d seen over his lifetime gave him some insight into the process – assuming, of course, that it worked the same way in real life as the furry community drew it.  <br />
<br />
Steve could imagine that few, if any, of the people churning out pictures of birthing anthros had ever actually witnessed a real birth, much less given birth themselves.  He could only wonder how little confidence he would inspire in the rest of the room if someone asked him just where his supposed ‘knowledge’ came from.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what to do, Steve nonetheless tried to sound professional.  “Are there any gloves?”<br />
<br />
The ‘doctor’ and his ‘nurses’ began looking around the equipment, finding nothing until Steve suggested they check inside the birthing bed.  Sure enough, one of the rabbits found a box of sterile gloves inside.  Still being held by Leon and with one of his hands still supporting the bottom of his belly, Steve lifted his other hand and asked the ‘nurse’ to put the glove on.<br />
<br />
Still with no idea on how to get out of this, Steve first pressed his hand against Austin’s spasming belly.  Yep, it was a pregnant belly alright, not that Steve told the rest of the room about his brilliant discovery.  He then ran a finger along the thin ring of black flesh that made up the bitch’s vaginal lips, and he could feel just how tightly they were stretched.<br />
<br />
Leon’s masculine voice spoke up beside him, “do you know why the baby won’t move?”<br />
<br />
“Yes master,” Steve’s body began, “the baby’s shoulders are stuck in her pelvis.”<br />
<br />
Steve’s mind jumped forward to the obvious question that he was sure Leon would ask next – ‘how do you know that?’  Steve didn’t seem to have any control of his body when he was responding to his… owner... so, how would his body respond? <br />
<br />
 ‘Because I’m a furry with a pregnancy fetish and I’ve seen porn of this exact situation’?  As bizarre as it was, that was probably the best thing that he could say right now, because the alternative was:<br />
<br />
‘Because I found an app that lets me alter reality and I’m a furry with a pregnancy fetish.  I used it to change everyone here into what they currently are because I’ve always kind of wanted to and also the app is evil and it egged me on.’  Steve was sure that would go over really well with the soon to be mothers who knew that they were all about to find themselves on the wrong end of a birthing bed.<br />
<br />
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Steve was fucked and not just… obviously the baby in his belly was a testament to the fact that his body had been thoroughly fucked, but now he was fucked in a different way.  What should he do?  What could he do?  His ludicrously pregnant body wasn’t capable of escaping, nor was he capable of lying to anthro lion that apparently owned him.<br />
<br />
Steve’s chest began to hurt as panic started to set in.  He knew that the only thing that could save him right now was a miracle, and whether it was a sort of intervention from the app or Steve’s own body doing what it could to save him, fate decided to very briefly smile on him.<br />
<br />
The muscles in his womb briefly wound themselves together, then uncoiled in intense spasm.  Just like what he’d experienced as the rabbit, every muscle in his torso suddenly contracted, smashing his baby’s snout against the brick wall that was his cervix.  His cunt lips quivered as a wave of fire expanded out from them.  Steve’s back ached, his stomach burned, and every bit of his tender, feminine flesh cried out in agony.<br />
<br />
“AAAhhhh!” Steve screamed.  This was it.  This was the first contraction.  His water was going to break and then he was going to end up laying in the birthing bed one room over.  The panic from before only increased as Steve realized that this insanity was how he was going to be ‘saved’.  No one would be able to ask him anything because he’d be spending the next few days agonizing in labor.<br />
<br />
Would he even be able to get this thing out of him?  The skunk he’d seen back in the car had sounded like she having the same problem that Steve had inflicted on Austin – her baby’s shoulders were never going to fit through her pelvis, so she’d never be able to complete a vaginal birth.  Since Steve shared the same body as that skunk girl, did that mean that he too would get stuck crowning?<br />
<br />
The fear of laboring endlessly, or of dying in labor, filled Steve’s mind until he felt something snap.  Like an instinct that was built into his body, Steve felt another spasm come from underneath his tail, followed by sound of fluid splattering against the linoleum floor.<br />
<br />
Had his water broken?  Steve barely had time to contemplate how dry his vagina felt when the overpowering stench of fetid skunk spray exploded out into the room to such an intensity that even Steve began to feel a bit queasy.<br />
<br />
Looking behind himself, Steve saw that the doe girl had leapt to her feet and right in front of her was a small pool of thick, yellow liquid.  Steve’s water hadn’t broken, he’d gotten so frightened that he’d sprayed.<br />
<br />
The room was briefly silent as everyone stared at the wide eyed, hyperventilating doe girl.  Nobody moved until the doe girl let out a loud yelp, followed by her back straightening and a gush of thick fluid spilling out from between her legs.<br />
<br />
“Oh god!” she cried, “Did my… oh god… please... this can’t be happening to me.”  <br />
<br />
A hundred-yard stare came over her deerlike face as she pleaded, “Please god...  I don’t want to give birth.”</p>
