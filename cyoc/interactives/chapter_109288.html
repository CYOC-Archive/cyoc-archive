<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s clawed hands clattered against Sean&#39;s keyboard sharply. His brown fur pattern was glistening with sweat. Sean, the gray one, leaned against the door to keep it shut, which was easy considering the strength his body now possessed. Still, he couldn&#39;t stop the door from shaking in rage from the bodies on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean!If you don&#39;t open this door, I will ground you for a year!I don&#39;t care if you want a dog, it&#39;ll stink up the house!&quot; The threat sounded like it came from Sean&#39;s dad. The reasoning came from his mother.<br />
<br />
With a wolfish grimace, Sean looked over to Jeff. He was mashing at the keyboard and mouse now, just trying to change the target settings. Finally, he found the target settings page. He gasped and immediately changed the targeting to &quot;group&quot;. Before he could hit the &#39;apply&#39; button, several dialogue boxes popped up in front of it, launching a volley of queries. Max limit? Minimum Limit? How far? Gender? They were more and they all seemed to require numbers. Sean started to make an audible whine to Jeff, telling him to hurry.<br />
<br />
Fully panicking now, Jeff scrambled to fill in the text boxes, each with a simple string of &quot;333&quot; and clicking enter. Finally he came to the last box, which Jeff didn&#39;t even spare a glance as he clicked the pink button instead of the blue or gray one. Either way, it made the dialogue box go away, so Jeff didn&#39;t care.Finally, he hit apply, which made Sean&#39;s computer whir, followed by the emitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it!&quot; Jeff snarled as he unplugged the emitter and pointed it at Sean and the door. Instinctively, Sean ducked away from the emitter&#39;s sight, which left the door unopposed. Now free to do what it does best, the door swung open, striking heavily against the wall as the hands of the three bodies on the other side of it forced it away. At the same time, Jeff fired the emitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t hide it, we saw the tracks--&quot; It was all Sean&#39;s father managed to say before the barely visible beam collided with his chest and scattered around him and the two women behind him. As Jeff looked at the ladies, he recognized Sean&#39;s mother… and his own mother!The neighbors at the door must have been his parents!Both Jeff and Sean stood on their haunches, silent and focused on the three individuals who began to change in front of them. <br />
<br />
Immediately, all three of their ears shifted upwards. Along the way, they grew triangular and canine-like, while also growing fur. As the fur filled in, Sean&#39;s parent&#39;s fur was gray like his, and Jeff&#39;s mother&#39;s was brown like his. As the fur took hold of their ears, it also took hold of their hair. Quickly, their hair became the color of their furry ears. Both women lost their dyed, blonde hair, and Sean&#39;s dad gained some back. As a matter of fact, fur started growing out all over them.<br />
<br />
Finally, the changes moved on with the rest of their head. All three eyes went from a natural green and brown, to piercing gold and amber. At the same time, their mouth and nose pushed out. Noses quickly became snouts, and mouth quickly became unmistakably lupine maws. The fur enveloped their faces and snouts as they grew them, and quickly left them with entirely wolf-like heads, fur and all.<br />
<br />
The fur seemed to initiate their changes as it traveled down from their neck to their bodies. At this point, all three seemed to grow, with fur rearranging their muscles to appear more imposing. Yet, at the same time, they appeared leaner and longer, especially Jeff&#39;s father. As their bodies rearranged, all their hips grew wider, with the opposite occurring at their mid-riff. Never the less, the growth was still too much for their clothing, which began give way.<br />
<br />
Sean looked nervously at his father, and then at Jeff. His hips weren&#39;t that large, and neither was Jeff&#39;s. As his mother and father tore through the clothes and grew claws, it was very clear how feminine both parents looked.<br />
&quot;Uh, Jeff… they&#39;re all looking a little different from us.&quot; He stammered, unable to look away from his father. His forearms grew more toned, yet also became slimmer. Then, all at once, all three changing individual&#39;s overtook their clothing, which clattered, tattered to the floor. There, Sean could see, flustered, what was happening plain as day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, they&#39;re all growing breasts!&quot; Sean yipped.The fur had completely shaped and overtaken their torsos. As Sean had said, they were indeed all growing breasts. Jeff&#39;s mom&#39;s breasts grew from a B-cup to a C-cup, with another pair right below that looked to be about an A-cup. Sean&#39;s mother&#39;s already D-cup breasts expanded even further to F-cups. She was also given another pair as well, the fur pushing out to give her a pair of C-cups. Finally, and most shocking to both Jeff and Sean, was Sean&#39;s dad. First, his chest widened at the top to accommodate breasts, and then an impressive pair of Double-D breasts pushed out, along with a second set of C-cups to complement his wife. All of their mammaries were furry, yet all of them had bright pink nipples, erect, jutting from all their breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff! What&#39;s happening?&quot; Sean began to whine as their parent&#39;s lower-bodies altered, while they themselves just stood there half-transformed and fully naked. First, their feet grew fur. Then, feet elongated, becoming digitrade as nails morphed into black claws. Fur climbed upward to meet their torsos. Their leg muscles stretched and contracted to utilize the new hind legs. Before long, their legs were entirely lupine as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, and almost thematically, the only remotely human portion remaining on the three parental figures was their pelvic region. It started behind them. One by one, each a tail snaked behind each. The fur traveled up their asses, making their already wide-hips become every slightly more shapely. Jeff and Sean however, were not really paying attention to their parent&#39;s rear-ends. They knew what was about to come.<br />
<br />
All three suddenly let out a very feminine moan, including the father. Both Jeff and Sean grimace and look down at their parent&#39;s groins. Sean&#39;s mother gasps inward and squirms while the fur overtakes her crotch. Then, Jeff&#39;s mother does the same. Finally, both males focus on the other male. Sean&#39;s father&#39;s penis was still present, and the only human thing left in the room. Yet, even though it was erect from pleasure, it was dwindling. Seven, five, three, two… they watched his penis shrink down to a nub. Then, its base moved upward. As it did, his balls retracted upwards and the sack flattened against his crotch. With the inward gasp finally coming from Sean&#39;s father, his ball sack parted, becoming a vulva, with the former penis becoming a clit. Fur soon overtook the sight, and Sean&#39;s father&#39;s pussy was hidden from the boy&#39;s sights.<br />
<br />
The three she-wolves slumped over as their transformation finished. They stood motionless, for a time. Just as Jeff was about to say something to Sean, the three lupine ladies shook themselves awake. All three of them, stared at Jeff and Sean, nude and perky breasted. Both Jeff and Sean look at each other, unsure of what&#39;s going to happen next.</p>
