<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve came home after his 'lecture' in a grumpy mood. Figuring he would grab coke and just go sulk in his room, he was further upset <br />
to find no Coke; &quot;Damnit!&quot;, he yelled, and took one of his mom's diet drinks. Yuck!<br />
<br />
He turned around just in time to see his 11 year old sister, standing there in the doorway, drinking a Coke. Steve's eye's popped open <br />
and he started yelling at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You took the last one! You little shit!&quot; Lauren may be a lot younger than Steve, but she knew damn well she could out-run her dweeb <br />
big brother any day of the week. Steve was made even angrier by the fact that Lauren was wearing her swimming warm-ups; he always <br />
teased her for looking like a tomboy jock, with her baggy black warm-up top and a swim cap covering her hair, unless you saw her face <br />
you could hardly tell she was a girl.<br />
<br />
The front door slammed in mid-rant, two of Lauren's team-mates walked in, moaning about how they were short a player for the meet <br />
because their relay anchor was sick and neither alternate showed up, either.<br />
<br />
Steve felt a twinge, and as the three younger girls took off to the basement to phone around for a swimmer, he was just about to tell <br />
them they were short a swimmer because swimming SUCKS, when he felt a total change of heart. Scratching his head, he thought <br />
about how it maybe wasn't fair that they couldn't have fun in the pool this afternoon. <br />
<br />
He didn't really notice himself shrinking; he did have a fair amount to shrink to match the height of an eleven year old girl. However he <br />
wasn't looking quite so nerdy anymore; the slightly greasy, unkempt hair on his head went from brown, to a coppery red that was <br />
damaged from the chlorine, it grew down to his shoulders and tickled annoyingly. He laughed at himself when he noticed the totally <br />
nerdy pants he was wearing. He pulled them off, standing in his boxers (which didn't seem to fit right) and large t-shirt, and felt totally at <br />
ease; very strange for a guy who kept himself covered up with black clothes head to toe most days. The total loss of body hair went un-<br />
noticed, although by now he new something was wrong.<br />
<br />
The strange feeling in his boxers intensified, his equipment started to feel very wrong. It was a tingling sensation that felt like when your <br />
foot falls asleep, this feeling just kept getting stronger until he couldn't feel it at all. He pulled down his boxers to see what was up, and <br />
got quite a shock when he saw nothing but the faint hint of a slit. (S)he was then distracted by a similar feeling beginning in his chest, <br />
although as this subsided, Steve's chest felt very tender and sore. Steve looked on as two minuscule bumps pushed out from the baggy <br />
shirt he, or now she, was wearing. Steve was now clearly a young girl, about the same age as her sister.<br />
<br />
She suddenly had a great idea and ran downstairs to see what her sister thought. Standing beside her, looking only slightly down at <br />
Lauren, she squeaked in a clean soprano, &quot;Hey, Lauren, if you want, I can give it a try and swim. Most people think I'm 11, so maybe I <br />
can sneak on your team, just for today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lauren furrowed her eyebrows, knowing this was totally weird and out of character, but she'd been warned about this sort of possibility <br />
by her parents, and her discomfort turned to a devilish attitude, mixed with gratitude that she'd get to swim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, okay, Steve, that's great! Run upstairs and get my spare swim suit and try it on, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve took off upstairs as Lauren explained what was happening to her friends. They all thought it was pretty cool and were glad they <br />
had a replacement swimmer, despite the unusual circumstances<br />
<br />
Steve found the suit, a body hugging one-piece in green, the team color. She felt a real thrill at the idea of putting on her sisters cute <br />
little swim suit. She stripped and pulled it on, marveling at the strangeness of being a girl and wearing a girls swimsuit, pausing to <br />
admire herself in the mirror. She took off running downstairs, noting how different her body felt as she ran: her hips moved differently <br />
and the new weight on her chest became more noticeable. <br />
<br />
Lauren and Melissa both held back a snort of laughter when they saw Lauren's &uuml;ber-nerd big brother appear, glowing with excitement <br />
and looking every inch an 11 year old swimmer-girl. &quot;So what should we call you while you're a girl, Steve?&quot; Lauren asked. &quot;How about <br />
Sarah? Does that sound good?&quot; Melissa queried. &quot;Sounds fine to me, shall we head to the pool now?&quot; responded Sarah, eagerly <br />
anticipating her chance to swim.<br />
<br />
Sarah had no metal changes other than a new found love of swimming. She wasn't thinking or acting like a girl at all. In fact, her head <br />
was reeling, there was so much to take in about this new body. She wanted to explore it further but right now she had a swim meet to <br />
get to, and the idea of feeling the cool water all over her new body sounded amazing.<br />
<br />
Lauren shook her head in amazement. She'd have to find a warmup for her, but that shouldn't be too hard. Just then, she heard their <br />
mom come home.&nbsp;</p>
