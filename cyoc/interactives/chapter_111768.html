<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Larry Summers was thirteen years old and like many people of said age attempted to effect an air of toughness which he in truth did not possess. He had short cropped brown hair and a generally gangling adolescent build. He usually wore black and liked to pose with his gang of similarly minded friends. His room was hope to posters of his favorite sports heroes and blustering musicians. He generally rejected a lot of things he&#39;d previously loved as Childish, but one pastimes that remained popular was tormenting his kid sister. He&#39;d gotten out of school early and was chilling on his bed when he heard a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
He sat up and rolled his eyes &quot;Can&#39;t you read the signs! Go away mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh don&#39;t be silly. I&#39;m not Mom,&quot; His sister&#39;s voice said on the far side of the door. &quot;I&#39;m your lovely little sister Lulu!&quot; Somehow she&#39;d managed to materialize right behind him which caused him to bolt backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the? How the hell did you get in here?!&quot; He then took on her altered visage. &quot;Waitaminute? You actually made yourself up as a clown?!&quot; He broke out in laughter. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d actually do that you little moron!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly to his complete surprise he got a custard pie in the face. When he removed the offending pastry he saw Lulu standing their idly tossing a second one in her left hand and with her right behind her back. &quot;Let me clear that up for you.&quot; She said as she pulls out a seltzer bottle from behind her back and hoses down Larry&#39;s face, blasting away the merange. While he is not in a place to notice it, where the water touches his skin ends up bleached. Some of the soda water ends up on his bed where the black messy black sheets begin to turn a bright red.<br />
<br />
Larry didn&#39;t notice how his sheets were turning bright red, or how his hair was either. From its roots to its tips is turned a bright happy red and it styled itself into an exaggerated cowlick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lousy crazy clown girl sister! I otta...&quot; Lulu put a gloved finger up to Larry&#39;s lips which forced him into instant silence. As she did so they began to turn a bright red same as his hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now now their!&quot; The clowngirl said. &quot;That sort of talk is mean and most un clown like!&quot; After a few seconds she removed her finger, beeped his nose lightly and stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you talk about, i&#39;m sure as shit no clown!&quot; He said as he stood up and was shocked into silence by two things. The first of which was the fact that his voice had gone from a cracking male voice to a deep goofy Bullwinkle voice, and that his feet were throbbing inside of his shoes. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on and why do my feet hurt so-&quot; he was t able to finish because his feet finally broke through this shoes becoming an enormous size 20, double his original size and they quickly encased themselves into bright red clown shoes with yellow soles and laces. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; He said in a mix of confusion, fear and oddly enough, wonder as a red nose grew on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how much I had in it you big silly goose. It&#39;s going around like crazy. Everyone&#39;s becoming a clown! Even so I doubt I had nothing to do with how it&#39;s going for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
His changes progress, makeup appeared on his face. Blue eyeshadow bridged the gap between his eyelids and his eyebrows, which were before black and bushy but soon sucked themselves into his head and reappeared are thick black drawn on lines. His lips became black and stretched into a smile, and red circles appeared on his cheeks. <br />
<br />
After that his original dark rock band punk clothes changed. First his pants became hula-hoop large and his underpants could be seen which were now much larger with red hearts. His black pants changed form their original black color to a bright orange with white polkadots. <br />
<br />
His shirt changed into a blue shirts also with white polka dots that covered his arms and stomach. On his hands a pair of white gloves appeared that looked like Mickey Mouse gloves and they grew to proportions such that his fingers were are big as german sausages. A red bow tie appeared around his beck that complemented this hair nicely. A final change to him was his body becoming a bit more muscular from it original scrawny build. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you certainly look like a clown now Larry-o.&quot; Lulu said that as she honked his brand new large nose, and also gave him a wedgie. Larry-o just laughed at the feeling of his underpants digging in, and also on impulse. But he pulled a ribbon on Lulus dress and the skirt and petticoat fell away leaving her panties for all the word to see. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you did not&quot; Lulu said as she was smiling and had a look of sweet revenge in her eyes. She got ready to throw the second pie she had in her hands, but Larry-o just redirected it into Lulus own face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mph, bluh.&quot; Lulu said as she wiped away the cream from her eyes. When she finally did instead of being angry she was smiling even more and laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come catch me if you can! Also I tied your shoe laces!&quot; Larry-o said as he began to run towards the door comical sound affects being heard. Lulu looked down and then remembered her Mary Janes didn&#39;t have laces. Lulu knew she had to get back at her brother, and she ran out the door as fast as she could in pursuit of him. <br />
<br />
An hour later, and following many pranks, which their mother joined in at one point. A voice rang out and said. &quot;Hello everybody I&#39;m home, do any of you have a clue what all of the clown clothes are about I don&#39;t see it at all.&quot; It was Mr. Summers he had just gotten home and had not hanged yet into his inevitable natural silly figure. <br />
<br />
Sunny, Lulu, and Larry-o, all immediately stoped the pies they were about to throw at one another and then got even wider smiles than before for a better idea of what to do. They get out a camera, and begin to watch Mr. Summer change, first his skin turned a pale snowy white and then...</p>
