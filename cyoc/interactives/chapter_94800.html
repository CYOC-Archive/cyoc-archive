<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You can&#39;t just leave her.  Even if it means risking becoming someone or something even worse.  You stand up and walk over to the mirror once again.  You stand there for what feels like fifteen minutes, getting more and more apprehensive as the clock ticks away.  Suddenly the mirror shimmers once again.  You watch as your reflection&#39;s hair grows and your face takes on a familiar, feminine shape.  You watch your arms and legs become slender and your chest fills out again.  Still the reflection&#39;s breasts seem larger and she seems less slender.  You realize that she&#39;s a few months pregnant now.  The thought startles you.  You&#39;d thought you could simply return where you left off, but it seems that she&#39;s been alone for a few months.  You feel a bit of doubt now about returning.  Suppose you can&#39;t go back this time?<br />
<br />
Still you reach out and touch the reflection.  You feel your soul being tugged away from your body and into the body before you.  You blink once again and look at yourself in the mirror.  You run your hands along your belly.  You&#39;re her again, and pregnant.  Suddenly your mind blanks.  You&#39;re not sure what to do from here.  Confronting the gentleman of the house seems futile, and the lady frightening.  You search the memories of the maid and realize that you&#39;ve been concealing this ever since you started showing, and no one else seems to know about it other then...him.  You scowl at the thought of that man.<br />
<br />
You realize, too, that you&#39;re standing nude and pregnant in the guest house and it&#39;s nearly noon.  You return to the wardrobe and gather the clothes you&#39;ve been using to cover up the baby.  You&#39;re half-way through putting them on when you hear a familiar voice clearing her throat.  You draw your hands close to you reflexively and drop the shoes you were about to put on.  You turn your head to face the lady of the house.  She gazes at you, with narrow suspicious eyes and arms folded before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...how far along are you?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...uhmm...f-five months I think, ma&#39;am.&quot; you hear yourself say.  The maid is in control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...yes, so it would seem.&quot; she says  &quot;Is it a boy in town perhaps?  Someone you&#39;ve taken a liking too?&quot; she says getting closer, you fumble on the rest of your clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...well y-yes, yes ma&#39;am that&#39;s what happened, it&#39;s a boy from town.&quot; you hear her say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure it isn&#39;t someone else?&quot; she says, her eyes piercing into yours.  When you don&#39;t reply she takes in a deep breath &quot;Are you sure it isn&#39;t my husband?&quot; she asks.  Your blush is the only answer she seems to need.  Without so much as a word further she reaches over and grabs you by the wrist and pulls you along.  Your awkward pregnant body stumbling after her as you hear yourself crying to her for mercy.  You want to take control, but the maid is so afraid that it&#39;s difficult, like trying to catch a fly as it buzzes around your head.  She presents you before the man and points her finger at your belly.  His eyes widen in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long did you think you could hide this?&quot; the lady says.  The man closes his eyes and takes a deep breath before responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t cover for you any more.&quot; he says with a sad sympathetic frown, he&#39;s an expert liar.  &quot;The poor girl became enamored with me, my sweet, and came to me late at night while you were away.  I was already fast asleep by the time she was atop me, and I confess, I allowed her to mount me.  I would have told you, but she begged me not to tell.  You know how softhearted I am.&quot; he says.  He lies smoothly and expertly, though when the lady turns her gaze to you he glares at you with a threatening look.  You&#39;re not afraid, but you feel the strength of the maid drain away.  Now is your moment.  You take command of her body once again, and just in time.  It seems that the lady was taking your silence for an admission of guilt and her hands were beginning to form a pale purple glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lie.&quot; you say, your own anger showing on the maid&#39;s face &quot;He&#39;d been putting his paws on me for months.  He let his robe drop and demanded I lie down on his bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I will not stand here in my own house and have my honor questioned.&quot; the man says, his cool demeanor shaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;My house...dearest.&quot; the lady says, adding a derisive emphasis to the last word.  She turns her gaze to him.  She looks in his eyes, causing him to fidget.  &quot;Now tell me the truth.  Don&#39;t lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sh-she...&quot; he says and hesitates &quot;...she seduced me, I am not to blame here.&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
As soon as he says that he clutches his gut and doubles over.  He groans in apparent pain.  When he looks up he holds his hands in front of his face as his fingers curl up and shrink.  Black claws sprouting from his knuckles and fur begins pushing out from the backs of his hands.  He tries to speak, as if to beg for mercy, but his tongue fights him as it changes shape and his teeth grow longer and his nose goes black and pushes away from his face in a muzzle.  His ears grow, forming into thin, furry flaps that flop over as his head shrinks and they position themselves at the top of his head.  His legs begin shrinking, as does his body and he hunches over as a large, fluffy tail springs out from behind his loose-fitting pants.  He falls forward on all fours as his arms shift into legs and his spine re-arranges.  You can&#39;t see much of him but what you do see shows light tan fur growing on his skin.  Soon he shakes his body and emerges from his clothing, but where once stood a man is now a golden retriever.  He tries to speak, but only dog-like grunts sound from him.  He tries to stand, but can&#39;t keep his balance on two legs for more then a second or two.  Finally he raises his head looks over at his wife, his tail tucked between his legs as he guilty looks away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a dog.&quot; you say, hardly believing what you&#39;ve seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seemed appropriate considering he&#39;d been putting his &#39;paws&#39; on you.&quot; the lady says, turning to face you.  For the first time since you, or the maid who&#39;s body you share, have seen her she has a warm smile on her face.  She walks over to you and places her hands on your shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for having the courage to tell me the truth.  You&#39;ll always have a home here, as will the child you carry.&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about him?&quot; you ask, though it seems to come more from the maid than from you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...perhaps he&#39;ll walk on two legs again, after he&#39;s learned his lesson.&quot; she says and strolls over to the dog.  &quot;In the meantime though, he&#39;ll be safe.  I&#39;ll treat him like the good little pet he is.&quot; she says ruffling his ears a little.  The dog simply sits on his haunches and follows by laying down, a small growl emitting from his muzzle.  &quot;You can stay here, or leave if you wish.  Either way know that you&#39;ll be taken care of.&quot; she says as she turns back and walks back over to you.  Her phraseology  intimidates you slightly &quot;In a good way I mean.&quot; she says.  She places her hands on your shoulders again and looks deeply in your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and you.&quot; she says, and you get a strange feeling as her eyes glow slightly &quot;Go home.&quot; she says and touches your forehead.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blink.  You find yourself back in the guest house staring at your own reflection in the mirror.  You pat your hands over your body and your clothes.  You&#39;re in your own body, in your own century.  You put your hands to your face and run them down your neck and over your chest.  You begin laughing from the sheer joy of being back to your old self.  You blink and gaze over to the old picture by the bed.  The young man is there, as is the maid sitting next to him, though his face is changed, a smile is on his face and his mothers.  Behind them the lady who cast the spell is sitting with a sly smile on her face as she points her eyes to the man, who gazes forward with a stern serious face.  It seems he was changed back into a human eventually after all, though the look on his face shows that he&#39;s probably still holding a grudge about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coulda been worse, ol&#39; boy, count your blessings.&quot; you say.</p>
