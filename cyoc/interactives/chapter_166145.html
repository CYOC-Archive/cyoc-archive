<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I just want to go after that woman who entered the woods. At a time like this it is not good to be unprepared in an unknown place, we do not know what can be on this island.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
I prepared to go into the forest picking up some knives in the kitchen of the plane that could help to pass through the dense forest. I thought about taking the flashlight, but as all the electrical equipment didn&#39;t work either, so I put together some dirty cloths and a lighter and took it in case I needed to make a torch.<br />
<br />
With everything ready I was heading towards the forest when I was stopped by a woman who said &quot;Hey young lady, wait a minute.&quot; She reached me carrying a backpack and said &quot;I heard that you are going after that woman who entered the forest and I think it is better if I go with you. I am used to exploring and it will be safer if you are accompanied.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. Thank you for joining me. My name is Tori, nice to meet you.&quot; I said and introduced myself to the woman<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Angela and the pleasure is all mine. We all have the same problem and so at least I can be useful.&quot; the woman said and soon after we entered the forest<br />
<br />
While we were looking for signs of the lady, Angela and I decided to talk a little and she told me that she was engaged, that she had gone to Australia on a bachelor party and should get married in a week, she even showed me a picture of her fiancé. that was in her medallion.I also learned that she had a degree in biology, coincidentally the same that I was studying, and I liked to travel the world to know the nature of each place.<br />
<br />
We advanced through the dense forest with great help from Angel&#39;s machete, since the knives I took proved to be insufficient for the job. Over time, we realized that we had never seen most species of plants or the fruits that grew on them. We also saw a few different birds flying over us.<br />
<br />
After walking for what seemed like two hours, we saw a part where there was more light, we went to see what was there and found a bluff with a river running about 5 meters below. Looking around, we found something we didn&#39;t expect on a supposedly unknown island. There was a rope bridge that gave access to the other side of the bank just a few dozen meters from where we were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Angela, look, there&#39;s a rope bridge over there. This means that there are people living on this island, let&#39;s take a look and maybe we can find help to know how to get off this island.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, look at the bridge more closely.&quot; Angela said<br />
<br />
I did as she asked and realized that it really looked different from a rope bridge. We approached and it was clear that the bridge was made with vines.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what I said, this bridge is made of vines. It was clearly made by human hands which makes it clear that there is a native population on this island, but we don&#39;t know if they are friendly and how they will react if they meet outsiders.&quot; Angela said<br />
<br />
&quot;So we better be careful. Do you think it is safe to cross this bridge?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe it is safe, the vines are very firm and appear to be very strong.&quot; Angela said<br />
<br />
We crossed the bridge and found traces of a trail in the middle of the forest, we followed it very carefully and in a moment we found some marks on the trunk of a tree that continued upwards. The tree was very tall and we found one that looked like a tree house on top of it, but it seemed to be in ruins and that no one had been there for years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tori, wait for me here, I&#39;ll go up there and see if there&#39;s anything that might be useful there.&quot; Angela said, took a rope from her backpack and used it to climb the tree, leaving her backpack for me to take care of. She went into the treehouse, but she didn&#39;t stay much inside and quickly left with a small chest in hand, which she threw into a bush near me before getting off the tree. &quot;There was really nothing in a condition for us to use, everything was very deteriorated and even the house looks like it will collapse at any moment. It was just this little chest that caught my attention and I decided it was better to see what&#39;s inside.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
We opened the chest and found some jewelry and gold coins, we also found a very old diary, but it had been well protected by the chest and we could still read what was written on it. Almost everything that was written in the diary described marine voyages and a crew of pirates, this caught our attention. When we finally checked the dates I commented in surprise &quot;No way, this diary is 300 years old and belonged to a pirate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And from what he says in this part it is clear that we will not be able to leave the island by sea. See for yourself.&quot; Angela said and showed me a part that said:<br />
<br />
               &quot;We were taken by surprise by a very violent storm and somehow survived, but perhaps it would have been better if we had died. Our ship is very damaged and we are drifting in the middle of the ocean, we also have no idea if where the wind took us.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the next entry it said:<br />
<br />
                 &quot;I do not believe that I am writing this. It&#39;s been a month since the storm and somehow I survived despite being the only one. All the others died of starvation or died in despair. After so long drifting I arrived on an island where I was finally able to get something to eat. The fruits of this island are different, but they are tasty. After recovering my strength I will try to find out where I am and how to get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the sefuinte page it said:<br />
<br />
               &quot;I couldn&#39;t find out exactly where I am, I just know it&#39;s an island. I built a boat and tried to leave the island, but the sea current is very strong and I was brought back to the island.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon after there was a last entry that said:<br />
<br />
               &quot;I don&#39;t know why this is happening to me, but my body is changing more and more, I don&#39;t even know if I can still consider myself human. I am still afraid to meet the native people of this island, but only they will be able to help me. It is decided, I will look for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the following pages were all blank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, when he says his body is changing does it mean he has turned into some kind of monster?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;We cannot say that since the pirate did not put any details about the changes he is undergoing, but there is definitely something strange about this island.&quot; Angela said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s another reason to find that lady soon and go back to the beach where the plane is. We need to inform everyone of what we have discovered.&quot; I said. I then kept the diary in my backpack and we started looking for you again.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of walking, we heard the sound of something that seemed to be coming out of the water very close, we followed the direction of the sound and found ....</p>
