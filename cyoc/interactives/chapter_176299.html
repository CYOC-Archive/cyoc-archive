<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex meandered down the dusty road at a brisk pace, sometimes breaking his stride to readjust his now much tighter pants. His improved musculature, courtesy of the werewolf Roc and the sexy farm stud Bo, was already putting a strain on his clothing, scant as they were. Now the leather material was stretched tight over Alex’s almost foot-long cock and larger balls. If he had a chance, he’d have to try and dig up some baggier pants in town, like Bo wore. He had been walking for more than a few hours now; the sun had been low on the horizon when he left but was now high in the sky when he left, signaling midday. He decided to stop for a break, selecting a tall and gnarled tree weeping over road. Alex peeled off from the road and dropped his pack in the shade of the tree, dropping down to the grass and attempting to cross his legs before wincing at the uncomfortably tightening sensation coming from his crotch.<br />
“Fuck it,” he said aloud. “If it’s just men in this world, then no one will have a problem with me free-balling it for a minute.” And with that Alex shed his pants, getting up to lay them down between the grass and his hairy butt. He sat down again, reaching for his pack and pulling out a loaf of bread and a small skin full of leathery-tasting water. The little herbal ball that Kirk had given him caught his attention. He grabbed it, examining it in his hands. It was dark green, firm but flaky with an earthy aroma, again reminding him of algae and kale smoothies. Alex used his thumbnail to chisel of a tiny chunk; it seemed to break up like a hard clod of dirt. He examined the little flake cautiously before pinching his nose and popping the morsel into his mouth.<br />
Immediately his senses of taste and smell were assaulted with the most overwhelming and earth combinations of sensations and flavors all underlaying a powerful bitterness. It made his jaw clench and his tongue shoot to the roof of his mouth, and Alex shook his head and groaned as the sensation diminished slightly. It was too bitter to spit out; he had to swallow it. He uneasily swallowed the little green lump, feeling like he could still taste it as it made its way to his stomach. He coughed and sputtered, grasping for the water and guzzling a few desperate sips. He brought the water away from his mouth, leaning back on his arms and taking deep breaths.<br />
“God damn. That was disgusting.” He shook his head and blew his nose; his sinus felt crisp and clear, his throat feeling kind of raw. “Hope that stuff works.” His hand drifted to his hairy stomach, which was starting to feel warm in a weird, but not uncomfortable way.<br />
Alex tore of a hunk of bread and chewed idly as he took in his surroundings. It was a beautiful clear day; this stretch of land seemed mostly unsettled and so the fields of wild grain stretched undisturbed in every direction. Far in the distance Alex could see the hazy outline of mountains; looking in the opposite direction, he noticed another hazy ridge of mountains, these ones taller and visibly snow-capped. This must be some great valley, Alex mused, no wonder I’ve encountered so many farms. A light breeze came through the area, feeling refreshing against his bare skin. Alex noticed that despite the nippy mornings, it was never really cold here in this world. The ambient temperature always seemed to be warm enough for men to comfortably wear as little clothing as they wanted…<br />
Alex laid back on the grass, crossing his arms behind his head and staring up into the tree branches overhead, his mind feeling blissfully calm. His eyes fluttered, and Alex wondered what was the harm of enjoying a little cat-nap for a few minutes…<br />
<br />
Alex slowly came awake, too warm and comfortable to bother opening his eyes and standing up for at least another few minutes. But a throaty chuckle alerted him to the presence of a stranger. Alex abruptly sat up, but what he saw when he opened his eyes would have convinced him he was dreaming if this had been his own world.<br />
The man before him was tall and wiry, the dark skin of his slim arms and narrow upper-body corded with lean muscles. His chest and arms were dusted in a healthy coat of rowan colored hair that matched the coarse head of hair and shaggy beard that hid the man’s face. He wore actual pauldrons on his shoulders and actual vambraces strapped to his strong-looking forearms. A weapon of some kind was strapped across his strong chest, and a belt of utility pouches hung around his waist. From the waist up he was an ordinary man, albeit relatively smaller and leaner than most of the men Alex had encountered in this world. From the waist down however, the man sported the furry legs, cloven hooves, and short, curled tail of a goat. He looked to the top of the man’s head and, sure enough, a pair of curled horns a few inches long stuck out from the matted locks on the man’s head. <br />
“What’s be matter, Human?” the creature said, a haughty look in his eyes and a rogue smile peaking through his bushy beard. “Never seen a faun before?”<br />
Alex just shook his head no, his eyes resting at the narrow loincloth that covered the faun’s groin. It matched the color of the scarf woven around his neck.<br />
“Well, I’ve never come across a handsome, naked, young man sleeping on the side of the road before.” He shifted his weight onto one hoof and stretched out his hand. “Allow me.”<br />
Alex hesitated, but the faun shook his hand as if to encourage him, so he took this strangers hand and let him pull Alex to his feet. The faun’s hands were rough and calloused, he noticed.<br />
The faun sized him up and down, that rogue smile still on his face, before finally looking Alex in the eye and reinforcing his grip on Alex’s hand. “I am Marsyas. And you are?” he leaned forward expectantly.<br />
“Alex, “he said. Marsyas broke the handshake.<br />
“Pleasure to meet you, Alex.”<br />
“Likewise.” Alex blushed a little but hoped it would be harder to see with his new facial hair.<br />
“Taking a break from your long journey?” he inquired. <br />
“Yeah, I’ve been walking since morning. And I worked all day before that.” he replied.<br />
“Myself as well. These hooves are barking! Would you mind if I joined you?”<br />
“Uh…sure. Be my guest.” Alex gestured to…the grass he supposed, taking a seat on his pants again before remembering he was naked before a stranger.<br />
“Oh! Sorry, lemme just put these back on,” Alex hastily began to step into his pants.<br />
“Oh, don’t bother. I know how much you humans love your pants,” the faun rolled his eyes, “But really I’m not bothered in the slightest.” Alex shrugged and sat back down, thinking for a moment and then reaching for the loaf of bread.<br />
“Would you like some,” he held the loaf out to Marsyas.<br />
“Thank you,” he tore a hunk off and started eating, tearing off small bites to chew.<br />
“So, what brings you out here on the road to Dicktin?” Alex began, after letting the faun eat for a moment.<br />
The faun waited for a moment before answering. “I pursued some leads concerning a personal interest of mine. They took far into the mountains, but in the end, it didn’t pan out.” He reached behind his pack and unhitched a water canteen. “I’m heading back to Dicktin to start fresh.” He took a deep swig from the canteen. “And yourself, my new friend? You smell strange, foreign.”<br />
Alex sighed. Of course, this guy could smell his otherworldly-ness. Very likely he might be able to sniff out lies just as Raf could.<br />
“I’m not exactly from around here. I came to this land and got lost. I met some people along the road who told me there was a man in Dicktin that I should meet. I later learned from a family of farmers that this man is a wizard by the name of Pascal. So that’s who I’m going to meet, to see if I can get some answers.” Alex stopped, wondering if he’d said a little too much.<br />
“I see,” said Marsyas. “Pascal sounds familiar. I think I remember hearing of a wizard by that name in the city working for the Archmage.<br />
“The what?”<br />
“The Archmage.,” Marsyas continued. “Syoran. He’s the ruler of the city. Most of the wizards in the city work for him as his deputies.”<br />
“That sounds dark.” said Alex.<br />
Marsyas nodded. “Yes, it has become a lot different over the years. Not the same place I remember visiting when I was just a kid.”<br />
“Are the other fauns living in the city?”<br />
“There’s a few of us; the few of us who decide to live in a city usually live in the parks and undeveloped spaces. We’re a quiet folk, we don’t like to cause problems.”<br />
“And there’s humans there too?”<br />
The faun chuckled before saying, “Yes, there’s humans there too. Most humans live in the city nowadays.” Marsyas wrinkled his nose. “I just hope there aren’t too many of them.”<br />
“Well, we should probably get going if we want to make good time.” Alex suggested. He looked over to Marsyas; having a companion for this journey would be preferrable to walking alone. “Would you like to walk together?” he asked.<br />
The faun cocked his head for a moment before replying, “Sure. It has been a while since I’ve had someone to talk to on my travels.” He stood up, dusting the leaves from the fur on his legs and rump. <br />
Alex stood up as well, stepping into his pants and pulling them up to his waist. Marsyas stood and watched Alex stuff his balls and manhood into his tight shorts, that same roguish grin on his face before he chuckled and walked over to the younger man. He put his hands of Alex’s, motioning for him to stop.<br />
“What?” asked Alex, wondering what was about to happen.<br />
“I think I have a good solution for you.” Marsyas reached into the larger pouch and started rummaging around. Alex’s eyes bulged when Marsyas suddenly struggled to shove his entire arm into the little big, a look of concentration on his face as he seemingly tried to identify the contents by touch.<br />
“Ah! Here it is.” He pulled out a long tartan cloth and handed it to Alex. “Try this, it should accommodate you much nicer than those leathers.”<br />
Alex took the cloth in hand, noticing a belt sewn into one of the long sides of the cloth; it was a kilt. He grinned and wrapped the kilt around his waist, cinching the belt and spreading out the ruffles. The pattern was neutral, and the cloth hung down just to his knees. But most importantly, his cock and balls felt wonderfully free.<br />
“Thanks man, those pants have been killing me all day.” Alex considered his old pants before stuffing them into his little pack.<br />
“Certainly. I don’t know how you humans think with your manhood all constricted in those pants all day long.” The faun shook his head with a laugh and unceremoniously started walking. Alex grabbed his bag and caught up, kind of enjoying the clip-clop noise of his new companion’s hooves on the hard dirt road.<br />
The human and the faun continued along the dusty road, sharing small talk and enjoying the brilliant day. Marsays seemed amicable enough; he had a relaxed air about him and seemed to be enjoying the scenery around him. Alex remembered the myths of his world and how fauns were often associated with nature.<br />
“So, have you been enjoying playing with magic?” the faun asked after a period of comfortable quiet.<br />
Alex blushed. “How can you tell?”<br />
“I can smell the vestiges of the magic. The energy has dissipated, but it always leaves behind a characteristic scent.”<br />
“Just a little blessing I picked up, courtesy of some werewolves.” <br />
At that Marsyas paused. “You ran into werewolves and all you got was a blessing?” he whistled. “I guess that’s not the worst thing they could have sank into you.”<br />
“Ha-ha, yeah. But they warned be that…getting romantic with anyone else might cause me to take on some of their physical traits as well, and it kind of got carried away.” said Alex.<br />
“Uh-huh. Was he worth it?” asked Marsyas bawdily, elbowing Alex in the ribs. “We he?”<br />
Alex tried to hide an embarrassed grin before saying, “Oh yeah. Definitely worth it. Plus, I guess he gave me a sort of parting gift, even.” <br />
“Quite the gift indeed.” agreed Marsyas.<br />
“He was a sweet man. So was his family.” He went on.<br />
“Farmers are usually good people. That’s what you get from working and nurturing the earth. It’s the city people you have to watch out for.” The faun replied ominously.<br />
The sun was slowly falling towards the western sky why Alex figured they must be close my now. Sure, enough in the distance ahead of them he could see smoke rising. <br />
“That’s the city up ahead,” said Marsyas. “Not much further now.”<br />
“Finally. I was starting to think we were walking in circles.”<br />
“And we reach the city, we can find a meal and a good drink, my treat.” said Marsyas, clapping his hand on Alex’s shoulder.<br />
“You don’t have to do that, I have money,” Alex protested. <br />
“Nonsense. I’m no stranger to these lands; I would be a bad travel companion if I just left you at the gate without bothering to show you around. Plus, if there’s one thing we fauns enjoy, it getting drunk with good company!” with that Marsyas quickened his stride, and easy feet with his hooves and springy legs. Alex had to jog a little to keep up. <br />
As they approached the city, Alex noticed that it didn’t seem to have walls or ramparts or turrets as he imagined a city would in this world. Instead, he saw tall buildings and towers rising up from an immense mound of earth. It reminded Alex of a mesa, except the walls of the earthen mound were flat and cut with small corners. A few smaller settlements surrounded the site, but they looked like more farmsteads.<br />
“I’ve never seen a city built like that.” Alex commented.<br />
“It was the first human settlement in the land, long ago,” said Marsyas. “When men first settled this place, their villages were constantly being overrun by the ferocious tribes of feral beast-people. The mound was created and the city build on top of it. The high walls of the mound make it impossible to climb in, and archers make short work of enemies who swarm into the corners. But now its just a feature. The city hasn’t been attacked in a hundred years.”<br />
The earthen mound and the city upon it loomed higher as they approached. On either side of them were the farms they had seen from afar. Alex noticed they were larger and more meticulously kept than the humble wattle-and-daub farm of Bo’s family. Though at least Bo’s home had character; these farms looked like they were being curated by Chef Emeril.<br />
The pair finally came to a stop at the foot of the great mound. An elaborate series of scaffolding built from the ground and up to the top seemed to house an elevator system. A guard slouched at the base, leaning against what must be the control booth with a bored expression on his jar-shaped face. He was big and burly, wearing only a bronze helm, a belted-loincloth, and some rust pauldrons. He started as Alex and Marsyas approached, apparently somewhere else. Despite his hulking appearance, he spoke with all the courage and temerity of Radar.<br />
“Whoa, there. Uh, names and business please.” he said, nervous clutching a long spear in both hands.<br />
They looked to each other and shrugged before the faun stepped forward. “I am Marsyas.”<br />
“And I am Alex,” <br />
“And we have business with the Wizard Pascal.” he said confidently. He turned to Alex and winked before turning back.<br />
“Oh, uh right. Well, uh on your way then. Don’t cause trouble. Gates close an hour after sundown.” The young guard waved his hand to the empty elevator space. Alex and Marsyas stepped aboard, Alex feeling a little uneasy about being on a wooden elevator with not safety rails. An awkward silence settled on them long enough for Alex to wonder why the hell they weren’t going anywhere. Marsyas cleared his throat.<br />
“Shit! Right, sorry!” the guard scrambled into the little booth and started hammering around before finally, with a loud his and an uncomfortable lurch the platform started rising.<br />
“What on earth was that?” laughed Marsyas.<br />
“Seriously. Are these guards hourly?” Alex replied, shaking his head. <br />
“I remember my first job…”<br />
“Why is that guy even there?”<br />
“Bureaucracy.”<br />
The elevator came to a stop some forty or fifty feet above the ground. Looking behind him Alex could see a grand and sweeping valley floor, dotted with farms strands of forest, stretching on for miles until it met the ring of mountains that contained it. The sun was starting to set, casting the land in a soft growing twilight. Alex turned away from the vista to see a long and cobbled city street, swarming with busy people, or just men, he guessed. And boy was it raining men.<br />
They were everywhere, more men than Alex had ever seen in his life. He felt like he was at a sporting event or something. Men of varying ages and appearances were walking to and fro, carrying barrels of water on their backs or heft sacks of green over their shoulders. A pair of stocky, dark skinned men stood a nearby doorway deep in conversation, a little boy of no more than four clutching his hand. Up above men were leaning out of their windows, shouting to the people down below or hanging their laundry. As they walked into a crossroads, they had to stop, Marsyas reaching his arm out protectively over Alex’s chest as a hoard of teenage boys came scrambling down a less busy side-street, chasing a leather ball as they kicked and punted it between each other. The buildings were simple brick and mortar, but some of them had been painted different colors; corals, greens, cyan. Windows were lined with baskets of herbs and wildflowers, and deep voices and baritone laughter filled the air. <br />
As they continued on down the main street the buildings seemed to become less residential and more commercial. The sidewalks were line with wooden stalls and carts and their attending vendors. Most were in some state of breaking down; the day was almost over as it were. Alex saw a corpulent man with a bald head and smooth face, perched on a wooden crate and counting stacks of little coins while a trio of young men packed up merchandise around him. In another stall a slender, young-looking man sang softly to himself while he folded and organized sheets of colorful fabric. Alex noticed that none of the men here seemed to take issue with Marsyas, nor did he see another faun or any other magical creature, at least not yet. Marsyas looked at ease, but his furry ears were drooped and I noticed his tail held high and tensed, like he was on alert.<br />
Alex and Marsyas followed the road until it led to a little square. In the center grew a fruiting tree of some kind, surrounded by boulders and stone columns all just high low enough to sit on. The buildings surrounding the square seemed to be shops of some kind, but the only one that was open was what looked like a tavern. Bar smoke and raucous talk drifted out through the open door. <br />
“Still want to go to a bar?” asked Alex. Marsyas had approached the tree to pull off some of its fruit.<br />
“Yes, but not this one. Come on, I know a better one further in town. Its closer to where the Wizard will be.” Marsyas handed Alex one of the fruits he had grabbed. Its skin was pure blue; Alex had never seen a truly blue fruit before. He popped it into his mouth. It was delicious; it tasted like a strawberry but it had the crunchy texture of a bell pepper. What a weird world, Alex mused.<br />
“Those are fantastic!” he exclaimed.<br />
“Yeah. Dobas are some of my favorite.”<br />
The road led them to different part of town than the crowded apartments they had encountered when they first arrived. Here the buildings were somewhat spaced apart and had little gardens in front. Some of them were occupied, their owners tending their gardens or reading a book. One of the doors opened and a large man stepped out, wearing only white linen trousers and carrying a tray full of food. He walked the tray to where a younger looking man was seated, reading a book in the sunlight. Alex noticed the younger man’s distended belly on his smaller frame. The man placed the tray down on a table next to him and gave the younger man a kiss.<br />
“Thank you, baby.” Said the younger man in a sing-song voice.<br />
“Anything for you my love. Got to keep my two favorite boys happy.” The larger man replied, rubbing the young man’s pregnant belly protectively. <br />
“Its still so odd to me,” muttered Alex before he caught himself.<br />
Marsyas followed Alex’s gaze and then nodded his head knowingly. “Yeah, me too. I can’t imagine myself having kids.”<br />
“Yeah, that’s what I meant. Good thing I got medicine for that.” said Alex.<br />
“Yeah, you humans gotta be careful. Thank the gods I don’t have to worry about that.” said Marsyas, relief in his tone.<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
“Oh. Fauns only procreate when they experience deep love and affection for their mate. The act bonds the two together as parents.”<br />
“So, you can only get pregnant, or get another faun pregnant, by choice, with the love of your life?” Alex asked incredulously.<br />
Marsyas paused. “Yup. Pretty much.”<br />
“Wow that is lucky. I have friends back home who would kill for that.”<br />
Marsyas led the way, the city streets growing quieter as night fell. Around him Alex heard the sound of doors slamming, windows shuttering, and bolts locking as the townsman closed up their homes from the night. There didn’t seem to be any panic or worry on the tired-looking faces of the men than hurried past them, but they definitely seemed eager to all get inside. Eventually they came to a place where the street seemed to break off in two directions; one leading down and another leading up a cobbled stairway. In the middle the Y-street was robust looking pub, with bright lights flickering from behind the crude glass windows. The pub had a little courtyard in front with a table and some rickety-looking iron chairs. A little sign hung above the door, the words “The Sack of Nails” written in that same strange language that Alex’s brain somehow knew how to read. Below it was a simple painting of a leaky cask and sack of nails at its base. <br />
“Here we are! I love this place.” exclaimed Marsyas hurrying Alex along. “Stick with me, sometimes the guys here can get a little handsy.” he said with a leer. He took Alex’s hand and rushed him up to the door holding it open for him. He noticed thar the faun’s ears had perked up.<br />
Inside the pub Alex was met with the smell of liquor, stale cigar smoke, and chorus of baritone chatter and bass laughter. On one side of the room was the bar; the rest of the space was devoted to many tables, booths, and a few gargantuan armchairs. The room was full of cheery men, drinking beer and gorging on what looked like this world’s version of cheap, delicious bar food. The bar was a wall of broad shoulders and hairy backs. Some of the men sported intricate tattoos, or dangerous looking scars; many had long hair that was braided or dreaded with careful precision. Many of the men wore leather trousers or kilts, but save for a few harnesses here and there, they were all bare-chested. Alex took a deep breath and let out an elated sigh; at long last he’d found a place in this world that reminded him of home.<br />
Marsyas led the way to the bar, squeezing between a big hairy lug with coal-stained hands and a red-cheeked man who couldn’t seem to stop giggling. He flagged down the bartender, an older hirsute man a shaved head and a broad bushy beard with salt and pepper streaks, matching the hairs that lightly coated his engorged pectorals and rotund belly. The man said nothing as he leaned forward, hearing Marsyas’ request and returning promptly with two large glass mugs full of frothy beer. The faun paid the man and the two picked through the crowd to find an open table. As they walked many of the men would pause their conversation to size them up, some of them growling and wolf-whistling. The pair found a table in the back, where it seemed a little quieter.<br />
Alex took a sip of his beer and once again appraised his surroundings. The beer was dark and hoppy, and of course, room temperature. The men in the bar seemed to mostly be blue-collar working types, judging by their manner and the many ruddy faces. <br />
“You’re being quiet,” the faun commented, eagerly working his way through his beer.<br />
“Just taking it all in,” said Alex, having another sip.<br />
“Yes, I’m sure its very different from your world.” The faun said with a mischievous look in his eye. <br />
Alex froze, looking into Marsyas’ eye. He just noticed they were hazel. “What do you mean?” he tried to play dumb and hid his face behind his beer.<br />
“Oh, don’t give me that. I’ve been travelling with you all day: I can smell it.” He leaned forward and took a strong whiff from Alex before leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms. “Yup, underneath that handsome musk is the smell of someone definitely not of this world. I’m a fan, I know a creature of this earth when I see one.” He drained the last of his beer before continuing. “I’m gonna fetch us another round. When I come back you can tell me your story and I’ll tell you mine.” He stood up from the table and clomped back over to the bar. <br />
Alex finished his own beer, figuring there wasn’t any sense in keeping up the pretense anyway. There were stranger things in this world than some outlander, he supposed. Marsyas returned with two beers in hand and sat down, leaning forward and resting his head on his clenched hands expectantly. Alex took another deep sip and proceeded to tell him everything, from waking up in the forest, his encounters with Raf and Roc and the nice farmers. He explained the subtle differences between his world and this one along the way, all the while affirming that he had no idea how he arrived here.<br />
“Wait so these women, you procreate with them?” Marsyas inquired, his face screwed up in confusion. “Why not just procreate with the men.”<br />
“Ugh. I told you; in my world men can’t carry children or give birth. And no, I don’t fuck them but, like, the vast majority of the male population does. Most animals on my world are like that actually.”<br />
“And you say that creatures like fauns and werewolves are only the subject of your worlds mythologies?” he asked.<br />
“Yeah. Our world is quite boring, in that way.”<br />
“How strange. Seems like a wildly complicated world that you come from. Most other worlds there’s just men.” Marsyas took a deep swig of his beer and pondered. “And You have no memories at all of how you arrived here?”<br />
“No. I came home from work, exhausted. I made dinner, tried to watch some TV…” but Alex was cut off.<br />
“Some what?”<br />
“Oh, its like, um…its just a kind of play. Anyway, I passed out on the couch, and the next thing I knew I was naked in a forest in the middle of the night.” Alex paused to watch Marsyas reach into one of his pouches and pull out a series of objects; a tiny draw-string pouch, a bundle of little twigs, and a long wooden pipe. He proceeded to dip into the little pouch, taking out a little ball of some kind of dried herb and stuffing it with his finger into the bowl of the pipe. Alex’s heart leapt.<br />
“Is that pot?” he said, leaning forward in his chair.<br />
Marsyas looked up at him from his task. “What? No, its sensamya. It grows like a weed around these parts.” He put the pipe to his lips, pulling out one of the little twigs and striking it against the table. It sparked up, and he held the flame to the bowl, taking a deep long drag before offering it to Alex. He took it and gave it a cautionary sniff; it smelled of wood and pine trees.<br />
“Yeah, this is pot, my friend,” he said, taking a deep drag. It tasted as good as it smelled, filling his lungs and his mind with a fragrant sense of ease. He handed the pipe back over to Marsyas and leaned back in his chair with his beer. “I needed that. So, what’s your story?”<br />
The faun smiled through his shaggy beard. “Well, I’m a bounty hunter. I spent the last few months in the wilderness to the east, trying to track down this scumbag thief masquerading as a trapper. But that trail went cold. I’m here to turn up some new leads, maybe talk to the Guild about a new assignment.” <br />
“Sounds like dangerous work.” Said Alex, arching his eyebrow.<br />
“Eh it can be. But I’m good with my axe, I get to travel and see the world, meet interesting people.” He said, wagging his eyes at Alex. <br />
“There’s probably an awful lot of walking too,” <br />
“Well, these babies were built for it,” Marsyas laughed, slapping his furry leg.<br />
“A few months in the mountains is leaving you looking pretty shaggy, my friend.” Enjoying the mood of the room and feeling a little bit drunk, Alex decided to keep up the flirt a little bit.<br />
“Oh, yeah,” the faun self-consciously ran his hand through his shaggy beard and unkempt hair. “I know, I could use a good cut. Although I was thinking about keeping it.” He suddenly sat up straight, puffing out his chest and clenching his jaw, turning his face slightly to the left. “Do you like it?” he asked in a fake serious tone.<br />
“I have no complaints,” replied Alex, leaning over the table to touch glasses. Marsyas clinked his glass to Alex’s and they both took a deep swig. <br />
The two men ordered more beers and talked more over a baked rooster and mashed potatoes. Marsyas told Alex about his forested homeland to the south and his raucous youth. Alex told him the details of his life and his work as a server, embellishing slightly when he didn’t feel like explaining modern conventions like traffic or cable bills. They finished their dinner and continued to get thoroughly drunk, exchanging jokes and tales that grew increasingly dirty. Pretty soon, the bar had mostly emptied and the conversation drifted for a moment before Marsyas stood up and disappeared. Alex took a long sip from his beer before realizing the glass had been empty for a long time when Marsyas returned, a little wooden card in his hand.<br />
“I got us a room. Let’s finish this upstairs.” He said, helping Alex from his chair. He didn’t object to the way Marsyas’ hand lingered on his bottom as he helped Alex up the stairs. Two flights and a long hallway later, they were standing before the door. They opened it to find a simple room, with a writing desk, a tall wardrobe, and a bed wresting on a heavy iron frame. <br />
“Homey,” said Alex, noticing a flagon of wine and a few dusty cups on the desk. He set down his pack and poured himself a glass, while a deep and heavy creak told him that Marsyas had seated himself on the bed. Alex turned around to see the handsome faun unclasping his vambraces and pauldron, lifting his axe from his back, and carefully folding his scarf before laying it on the little table next to the bed. He sipped his wine while he watched the faun arrange his things in an orderly pile underneath the bed before starting to unbuckle his belt.<br />
“I suppose I owe you a good show, after the one you gave me today,” he said, dropping his belt on the ground. He was now only in his sash and loincloth, which was beginning to tent.<br />
Alex faked an offended gasp. “You were watching me sleep, weren’t you?”<br />
“Only for a moment. You looked so peaceful,’ He smiled his roguish smile, his eyes shining through his beard. He undid the knot of his sash and let the loincloth away. Alex was surprised to see the faun’s cock was more or less human in appearance, albeit much larger. The skin was almost dark enough to match the thick dark fur of the faun’s legs, except for the pink head steadily emerging from the tip. He was well past eight inches in length, and still growing. A large pair of balls the size of blood oranges hung beneath coated in a lighter layer of his rowan fur. Marsyas stood there on his cloven hooves, one hand rubbing the mat of hair on his chest and the other held over his hairy stomach. Alex’s mouth watered at the sight of this beautiful man creature before him; his only response was to set down his wine and start unbuckling his kilt. His enhanced manhood was quickly hardening, and he could feel his larger balls churning.<br />
Alex reached to take a final sip of the bitter wine. “Here baby, lemme take care of you.” Alex crossed the room and fell into Marsyas’ strong chest, pushing him onto the bed. He relished the sensation of his hard cock trailing over the faun’s soft, warm fur as he kissed him hard and deep. Marsyas returned the kiss before flipping them both over. Now on top, Marsyas lower his mouth to the gentle curve of Alex’s neck, kissing, suckling, and biting as Alex writhed in pleasure. The faun seemed to shudder and drew back for a moment before diving down and continuing his assault on Alex’s neck, behind his ears, and of course his neck. The faun’s beard was so coarse and scratchy it almost hurt but Alex didn’t want it to end. Marsyas reached down and caressed both of their cocks together as they continued to kiss passionately. <br />
Now Alex flipped the faun back on his back, giving him a strong kiss on the lips before turning attention to the faun’s nipples. The were hard under their protective layer of light rowan fur. Alex suckled and nibbled passionately for a few minutes before turning his attention lower to the faun’s hairy stomach, giving him a final kiss on the naval before resting his eyes on the goat-man’s throbbing cock. Hard, it was longer than his own, but not quite as girthy. The skin was dark and taught with veins; it bobbed slightly with the faun’s heartbeat. He lovingly took the tip into his mouth, licking and kissing it as if it were the faun’s own lips. Then Alex slowly began to work the shaft deep into his mouth. The skin of the faun’s dick tasted rougher to his senses than a dick normally would, but he relished at the sensation of hard length stretching his jaw. He steeled his nerves and worked it further down his throat, using both his hands to knead and massage Marsyas’ pendulous balls. Marsyas moaned and writhed around Alex as he did his work, his furry legs twisting around Alex and locking tight behind his back. Alex let one hand reach behind and fondle the faun’s ass, pleased to find his cheeks full and firm beneath the layer of thick fur. He quickened his pace as he ran his mouth and throat up and down the faun’s throbbing length, pausing for a second. Marsyas made a grunt and looked up from his ecstasy, wagging his shlong in Alex’s face expectantly. Alex just laughed and dived down; he loved it when a man missed his attentions. <br />
Marsyas was now breathing deeply his arms writhing around as squirmed and sighed from the sensations Alex was giving him. Alex carefully but thoroughly worked the head, while driving both hands up and down his great shaft to give the back of his throat a break before deepthroating him again. After a long assault, Marsyas finally put his hands around Alex’s head and lifted him of his painfully hard cock.<br />
“That’s enough, baby. I gotta have you now.” He said in a low growl. “On your hands and knees for me, baby.”<br />
Alex’s felt a rush of attraction at that and eagerly did as he was told, happy to oblige. The faun got off the bread, taking a deep breath before roughly grabbing Alex by the legs and lining him up at the edge of the bed. He felt the faun’s large fingers probing around at his ass and gasped when one of them slipped in, then two, and then three.<br />
“Damn, boy. You’re so slick,” he laughed running his fingers in and out rapidly for a moment causing Alex to arch his back and sigh with pleasure. <br />
The fingers removed themselves and suddenly Alex felt something warmer and softer probing around behind him. He took a deep breath and the let out as Marsyas slowly but forcefully worked his cock inside Alex. Alex just tried to relax and enjoy the steadily increasing and deepening sensation of pleasure that was wracking his body. He felt the faun pull back a few inches before driving it all the way in. Alex yelped and clenched the bed sheets with his hands while Marsyas stood there and let Alex get used to his presence. He could feel his as resting on the faun’s hairy thighs, soft and warm.<br />
Marsyas gave Alex’s ass a few experimental thrusts before he started pounding away. Alex just knelt there and enjoyed the feeling of Marsyas’ hairy stomach brushing his backside, of his giant ballsack slapping against his ass. Marsyas ran his hands along Alex’s back, massaging his shoulders, his arms, his ass as he blissfully fucked Alex hard. Alex reached for his cock to start jerking as Marsyas fucked him, but Marsyas knocked his hand away. He tried again but this time he grabbed Alex’s hand and gently but firmly held it behind his back, pausing mid-thrust.<br />
“No, tonight, your pleasure comes from here.” And to illustrate he back out almost all the way and then slammed his whole length back in, making Alex lose a laughing shout from the overwhelming sensation. He continued to thrust into the smaller man at a furious pace. Alex groaned as he was assaulted by waves of pleasure seemingly emanating from Marsyas’ prodigious dick. The inside of his ass felt electric and relaxed, surrendering to the firm cock gliding in and out of him. The pleasure radiated outward, to his throbbing cock stuffed between his stomach and the linen sheets, out to his chest and down his legs and up hise. His hands latched onto the headboard as his toes curled. It was a different feeling that the transformation induced by his previous lovers, but Alex could still detect the exergonic thrill of magic creeping through his flesh and bones. Alex realized that his was feeling another pleasure, a somewhat distant but powerful feeling of joy, dominance, and lustful madness. As Marsyas switched pace to longer, deeper strokes Alex realized he was feeling the faun’s feelings as well. It was as if their senses and emotions were connected through the faun’s cock inside him. Marsyas put a hand on Alex’s ass cheek and gave it a tight squeeze. Feeling both the pleasure of being touched and the faun’s delight at gripping the man’s ass has he fucked him. Alex could only lay there and enjoy a master at work; Eventually, after what felt like hours, Marsyas began to pick up the pace. His thrusts turned rapid and desperate and his grip on Alex’s body tightened as he tried to drive himself as hard and as deep into the man as he could. Alex could feel the crescendo building within Marsyas, he could feel the faun’s balls churning with need and the pleasure steadily rising. Finally, the faun let out a grunt and a moan, haunching over Alex’s prone form and clutching the man to his chest as he came hard and deep into the man. Alex came to, his orgasm brought to the edge by his lover inside him and both men tensed under the wave of each other’s pleasure. Alex could feel the faun’s balls churn and throb as they emptied into him, as strongly as if they were his own. He sighed at the pleasant warmth he could feel deep inside of him as tired sense of victory and contentment settled over him. Marsyas slowly let his weight push them both back onto the bed. They lay there in the afterglow of theirs and each other’s orgasm while Marsyas’s cock slowly softened inside of him. But Marsyas pushed himself further into Alex making him moan and shudder. He wrapped his strong arms around Alex’s chest and cuddle his face into the bend of Alex’s neck. They maneuvered around on the bed until both of them were comfortably laying on their sides, Marsyas still behind Alex with his cock still inserted in his warm hole. Alex luxuriated in the way Marsyas’ furry legs and hocks radiated warmth on his body.<br />
“Thank you, my friend,” Marsyas kissed him on the nape of the neck, “I needed that. It has been a long time.”<br />
“My pleasure. And yours too, I guess.” Alex nuzzled himself closer to the faun’s chest. “What was that?”<br />
“Faun’s empathically connect when we make love. We experience each other’s pleasure as well as our own.” He murmured softly. “Do you miss your home world?”<br />
Alex pondered for a minute. “I miss some people. My parents, my friends.” He cleared his throat. “I don’t miss my crappy apartment. Or my job. Or bills.” <br />
“You’re not the first outsider to come to this world,” said Marsyas. “There have been others before brought here from different worlds. Some similar and some very different.”<br />
“What happens to them?”<br />
“They wander, and eventually they assimilate. People who come to this world say it changes them such that they are able to adapt.”<br />
“So, does that mean that I’m…” Alex’s voiced trailed off.<br />
“Receptive?” the faun giggled. “Yes. Your body no doubt has changed to perform natural reproduction as it is on this world.” he said, gently thrusting his cock a little deeper into Alex.<br />
“Oh god, I gotta keep up with that herb-stuff.” Alex covered his face with his hands.<br />
The faun laughed. “Don’t worry, my little man-slut. Like I told you, fauns choose when they sire a son. We don’t normally like to breed with humans anyway.”<br />
“Maybe I can find someone else who isn’t from this world. Maybe even someone from my world.”<br />
“Maybe,” Marsyas replied. His hand drifted around to Alex’s semi-hard cock, hefting it and stroking its length with a delicate hand.<br />
“I take it you didn’t bring this with you from your world?” he said, his thumb rubbing the head of Alex’s cock idly.<br />
Alex snorted. “No. I, uh, got that from a friend.”<br />
“Have you tested it out yet?”<br />
“Not really. I’m kind of more of a bottom. It does feel nice though.” Alex pushed back into the faun’s hairy chest and Marsyas’ light touch turned into a firm grip running up and down Alex’s growing shaft. <br />
“Would you like to?” Marsyas asked genuinely. <br />
Alex thought about it. He normally enjoyed bottoming; he loved the feeling of a man wildly thrusting into him, the sensation of being filled and stretched. But something in churning within him, or his lemon-sized balls more likely, that was enticed by the idea of taking this handsome goat-man from behind and fucking him in kind. Maybe it was some of Bo’s wily, farm-stud spirt in him that made his dick harden in Marsyas’ hand at the thought.<br />
Alex turned around to kiss Marsyas on the lips before saying, “I would actually.” Marsyas grinned his roguish grin and promptly withdrew from Alex, pushing him onto his back. The faun straddled him, his furry legs tickling the bare skin of Alex’s thighs.<br />
“Well, then let me get you warmed up.”</p>
