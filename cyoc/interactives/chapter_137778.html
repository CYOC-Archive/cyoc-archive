<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An hour passed and Rieg was still inside the closet, waiting, almost losing hope. He wanted to check on Peter, but he already trusted in him as much as he trusted Jonas. He decided to stay and wait with the cuffs left on the bed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the living room, Mei Qi answered a knock on the door. The visitors had arrived. She greeted them in Chinese as they make their way in the house. Mei Qi ran into the kitchen to prepare food as both brothers decided to sit down.<br />
<br />
Carl Tan, 18. Pure Chinese but had decided to use an English name since they are already living in the US. He&#39;s tall, about 5&#39;10&quot;. He&#39;s a little bit lean in terms of his muscles, having 6 pack abs, defined pecs, thick biceps and broad shoulders. He has jet black hair, deep brown almold-shaped eyes, defined nose, cute ears, thick eyebrowns and a pale skin. He&#39;s very into photography, yet he&#39;s not that of a geek for it since he loves sports and working out as well. He&#39;s that type of a guy who loves showing off. Even if he has these traits, Peter was 100% sure that Carl was gay. His brain telling him he saw Carl kiss a guy in a bar one time, and they went farther than that.<br />
<br />
Chen, 12. He resembles his older brother a lot. The only difference is their age, height, weight, and eyes which are much lighter in color. He&#39;s 5&#39;0&quot;, skinny and seems to be that type of a kid who loves studying more than playing. From what Peter knew, Chen as well was gay. It was just a speculation though. Chen was very passive, but Peter &quot;saw&quot; Chen check out a few older guys before as if he&#39;s curious or attracted.<br />
<br />
Peter walked down the stairs and saw the two brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Uncle.&quot; Carl and Chen greeted, Carl in English while Chen in Chinese.<br />
<br />
Peter greeted back, walked near them and gave them a few gifts, which confused the two since there wasn&#39;t even anything for them to be rewarded for. Peter gave Carl a new lens for his camera and a cap for Chen that he got from a trip last month back in China (which is of course, reality alteration&#39;s job). He also gave them a few bucks for them to spend. They both thanked their uncle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway. Feel free to roam around in the house or in the backyard. I had also set up a console in the guest room just if you want to play some games.&quot; He then left the living room and into the kitchen, leaving the two subjects alone.<br />
<br />
It was their first time in their Uncle&#39;s house so they began to roam around together. A few minutes later, they decided to run up the stairs and into the guest room. Rieg was alarmed by the two and had almost jumped out the closet. Fortunately, he remained quiet.<br />
<br />
The two began to play some games on the console while Rieg watched them. Rieg got a good look at Carl&#39;s body. His cock tenting in his shorts. He wondered what would they look like when Carl and Chen fuse together.<br />
<br />
Chen, being curious and all, saw the cuffs on the bed and grabbed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carl, look.&quot; He said as he dangle it in front of his brother&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
It caught Carl&#39;s attention as well and he took it from his brother.<br />
<br />
He decided to wear one of the cuffs on his wrist, thinking it&#39;s some sort of a bracelet. He took a good examine of it. He found that it looks good on his wrist so he took a picture of it with his phone. On the other hand, Chen grabbed the other cuff and wore it on his wrist as well.<br />
<br />
Both of them felt a warm feeling surge all over their body. They both looked at each other as they both knew that they are feeling the same thing. Rieg watched them as they quickly melted into a shapeless liquid under their clothes. Both blobs began to slip out of the pile and combine with each other, together with the cuffs. The blob began to rise up, reaching a height of 6&#39;0&quot;. It finally started to take a form of a muscular male but without a face, hair, dick and balls or even any opening. It looked like a mannequin, a very hunky mannequin. 6 pack abs, hard defined pecs, nicely shaped biceps and calves. It&#39;s silvery color began to change to a combination of pale and tan. It&#39;s skin changed it texture to match a soft humane skin. Veins began to show up on his arms and neck, showing all the hard work that the man would have while working out. Finally a cock grew out of its empty crotch. Something Rieg would be delighted to take a hold of. A 9 inched flaccid cock. Matching balls dropped out as well. It&#39;s face began to take form. It&#39;s eyes opened and blinked. A nose grew out its face. His mouth opened and he started to breath heavily. He had a nice set of pearl white teeth which is something to be proud of. Ears surfaced out of the sides of his head as well. Hair began to grow out his scalp, under his nose and on his chin. His hair on his scalp grew and was splitted in half in style while his mustache and beard were nicely trimmed. His vision began to blur, then a thick framed glasses appeared to help him see.<br />
<br />
The physical transformation was done, next was the reality and his brain.<br />
<br />
The new man&#39;s cock began to harden as new memories filled hs brain. This time, the cuffs helped Rieg with his urge. The man began to grip his hard on and started to jack off. Carl and Chen&#39;s personalities began to merge turning the man into Charles Tan, Peter&#39;s cousin, A full time photographer in his 30&#39;s. Memories of him and Rieg began to enter his brain, how they met and what are their relation to each other. Charles began to remember having sex with Rieg for the first time, disregarding the fact that Rieg was younger than himself. Rieg as well felt the change as his brain alter to fit the new reality, yet he knew that it was the job of the cuffs. He closed his eyes as everything changed in his brain.<br />
<br />
Charles&#39;s new memories are all in his brain now. The transformation was complete. He began to moan in his deep voice as he fall back onto the bed. He stroked his cock much faster. He began to think of Rieg&#39;s body and his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Rieg... Fuck yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, he came out his huge load all over his torso and his crotch. Unfortunately, Rieg wasn&#39;t able to see this for his brain was still altering his memories.<br />
<br />
In confusion, he stood up and looked around. He felt like he had just been born. He began to question himself. Who is he. What happened. Where was Carl.... and Chen...<br />
<br />
He grabbed Carl&#39;s phone and ran into the guest room&#39;s bathroom with cum dripping on the floor. There he saw himself in the mirror in shock. He grabbed a towel and wiped his cum off his body and covered himself with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;God damn it. I&#39;m so hot.&quot; He smiled at himself as he unlock Carl&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
He took a picture of himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After that, he went out the bathroom. But this time, it wasn&#39;t the guestroom. The room changed to match the new reality. Charles lives in Peter&#39;s house due to some personal problems. Everything was changed. There was a desk on the corner with Charles&#39;s laptop. There were shelves and a few stuffs he owns. The console was gone, as well as Carl and Chen&#39;s clothes.<br />
<br />
Rieg was standing out the closet. His brain still mixing things up. Charles smiled and hugged Rieg from his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; He said and kissed his neck.<br />
<br />
Rieg snapped out of it and faced Charles. He took a nice look at his bare body. Charles&#39;s muscles carressing Rieg&#39;s. Charles can feel Rieg&#39;s rock hard cock on his thigh which made him hard as well. They both smiled at each other and leaned in for a kiss.</p>
