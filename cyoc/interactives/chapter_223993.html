<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter scooted back on the bed a bit. He had no idea how he had ended up a pig man in a bedroom with a big hot wolf, but this wasn’t an opportunity he was going to waste.<br />
<br />
“Well… it doesn’t seem fair for me to be the only one who’s dressed,” he grinned and began to undo his belt.<br />
<br />
Tiny’s ears perked. Just like that. It was adorable. “Arf! Really?” he beamed.<br />
<br />
“I want to watch my changes too,” Peter chuckled.<br />
<br />
Tiny started to play-growl again, “Mhmm, I might have stolen the show there. I think you’ve already changed piggy.”<br />
<br />
“R-really?” Peter blushed, looking for any obvious changes on himself.<br />
<br />
He didn’t exactly have a fur coat. Peter did finally pick up on the large glossy hoof caps that had grown in on his fingers in place of his finger nails. They clacked together curiously and-<br />
<br />
Before he could inspect any further, Tiny casually picked up one of his legs. The wolf started tugging at his shoe laces with his claw, easily pulling the shoe off Peter’s foot. “I’m willing to bet you don’t have feet anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Wha- what?” Peter blinked.<br />
<br />
True to his word, Peter’s sock didn’t look quite right. It was all lumpy, and drooped down towards the end. Tiny grabbed onto the end of the sock and gave it a firm tug.<br />
<br />
“Squeee!” Peter’s eyes went wide. He had a hoof! Resting at the end of his leg was a cloven hoof! It looked relatively well cared for and polished, but oink, he had a hoof!<br />
<br />
“Such a drama queen,” Tiny smirked. He started to pull off Peter’s other shoe, “You didn’t hear me howling.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I just uh-“ Peter waved his leg in the air, “I can’t feel my toes…!”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have toes,” Tiny pointed out. He brushed the shoes and socks to the floor and started to climb into the bed.<br />
<br />
Tiny suddenly stopped. He had one knee up on the bed, and was propping his weight up on its springs. Even with all the brown fur covering his face, Peter could see his cheeks go red.<br />
<br />
“May I…?” His tail started wagging faster.<br />
<br />
“Get up here already,” Peter oinked.<br />
<br />
Tiny’s ears shot up again. He let out an excited bark as he climbed up beside Peter.<br />
<br />
“So… You um-“ His ears twitched bashfully.<br />
<br />
Peter smiled, “I’m up for this.”<br />
<br />
“Arf!” Tiny’s sheath twitched, “No, I mean- I don’t know how to say this. You put on some weight.”<br />
<br />
“Oink?” Peter snorted and looked down at himself.<br />
<br />
Tiny slid his paws up along Peter’s sides. Oink! His… hips felt a little wider? Admittedly he hadn’t had someone else feel him up in a while, and never with paw pads. But his arms and legs still felt a bit thicker.<br />
<br />
The wolf man started to peel his shirt back. Peter was never <i>in shape</i> per se, but a roll of fat around his mid section was news to him. Oink! Oh jeez, he jiggled whoever he snorted!<br />
<br />
“Woof, I’d say you went up at least a shirt size,” Tiny grinned. That was probably being polite…! This felt more like two easily! Tiny kept sliding his paws up, tugging the shirt up to Peter’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Peter held his arms up, letting Tiny slide the shirt off completely. He was a little surprised when the shirt collar got caught on his chin.<br />
<br />
“Life of a foodie-“ Peter started. He looked up at Tiny. The wolf had slid fully onto the bed at this point. His muzzle was looming over him, staring down.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh,” Tiny licked hips chops, “Hey pig… I’m going to kiss you now.”<br />
<br />
Peter nodded bashfully. He felt Tiny lower on top of him, pressing his lips up against his mouth. The mechanics of making out with a muzzle felt different, but somehow they both managed to get it locked up in a way that felt nice. Tiny reached up to try and wrap his arms around the wolf, but he realized he was practically sinking into the bed. <br />
<br />
“Mhmm,” Tiny felt his squirming and finally pulled back. He grinned as he hovered over Peter, “You’ve got a bit of a snout on you.”<br />
<br />
“Oink? Are you saying I have a big mouth?” Peter teased.<br />
<br />
“What?” Tiny blinked, “No, hey, come on now. I mean your face is pushed out!”<br />
<br />
Peter felt a wolf paw curl up under his chin. It wrapped around his elongated face entirely. The end of Tiny’s claws perked up easily over his nose. Oink! Tiny’s paws were <I>huge</i>. Peter was only picking up on how much larger the wolf had grown now that the two were up close.<br />
<br />
Peter reached up, gently feeling his face after Tiny had let go. The new shape was a little odd. His cheeks felt really chubby, and it was kind of hard to count his chins when his snout came so far forward.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow…” Peter went a bit cross-eyed, “That’s new.”<br />
<br />
He noticed Tiny sliding down the bed. The wolf inspected one of his hooves for a moment, then started tugging on the hem of his khakis. His face lit up when he saw Peter looking down at him, “May I?”<br />
<br />
“Be my guest,” Peter pulled his hands back.<br />
<br />
Tiny slid down the bed a bit. Peter wondered how he was going to go about taking his pants off… but he didn’t expect a furry arm to reach under the small of his back.<br />
<br />
“Oink?” He tilted his head, “Squeee!”<br />
<br />
Peter let out a startled squeal as Tiny easily lifted his lower half into the air. Tiny must be stronger than he looked!<br />
<br />
“Allow me,” Tiny grinned. He grabbed onto the bottom of Peter’s pants and started to pull. His arms were long enough that he was able to get Peter’s khakis off in nearly one clean pull.<br />
<br />
“Oink…! Easy!” Peter squirmed.<br />
<br />
Tiny played with his tail for a bit before setting him back down. Now all Peter was wearing were a pair of obscenely tented boxers.<br />
<br />
“You still doing alright piggy?” Tiny wagged playfully as he lowered him into the bed, “I don’t want to toot my own horn…. But I’ve got a pretty great tongue.”<br />
<br />
Peter laughed at the panting wolf, “Yes yes, you can take my boxers off already…!”<br />
<br />
“Why thank you,” Tiny grinned and slid between Peter’s legs. He gently gave the undergarments a tug, pulling them down the pig’s thick thighs.<br />
<br />
Peter’s cock immediately sprung into the air. It slapped into the bottom of Tiny’s muzzle, smearing a bit of pre into his fur. The canine let out a surprised bark.<br />
<br />
“Oink! Sorry about that…!” Peter sat up a bit.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, just startled me,” Tiny chuckled, pulling the boxers down around Peter’s hooves. He stopped and started, “You’re huge…!”<br />
<br />
Peter blushed as he kicked off his boxers, “No I’m-“<br />
<br />
“Yes you are!” The wolf bent down, sliding his paw around the base of Peter’s shaft, “You’ve got a fat hog pig!”<br />
<br />
Peter wasn’t used to his cock getting so much attention. He didn’t have a sheath, and he couldn’t tell just how porcine his manhood had become. Honestly only the last few inches poked up over the top of his stomach from this point of view. It looked about the same size as it always was. Maybe he was a little thicker- Squee!<br />
<br />
Tiny finally licked his chops and ran his slick tongue along the underside of Peter’s shaft. “Woof, what I’d do for a cock like this,” he grinned.<br />
<br />
Peter immediately started to squirm, “Oink! That- That’s some tongue…!” He felt his leg kick, but quickly realized he needed to be careful with that. He was liable to knock some teeth out if he got ticklish and hit the wrong spot.<br />
<br />
“What I tell you!” Tiny grinned. He slid his paw around the base of Peter’s shaft and got to work. After a few laps he glanced up and made sure he got a nod from the pig to keep going.<br />
<br />
Not that he could get much more than a nod out. The mouth on this piggy! Peter let out an eager squeal every time Tiny lapped his shaft. Half the upstairs probably knew there was a pig having sex tonight. <br />
<br />
“Don’t get all your squeals out just yet,” Tiny looked up at Peter, “I have no idea what this feels like, but everybody tells me it’s delightful.”<br />
<br />
Before Peter could ask what Tiny was going to do, the wolf slid his entire muzzle over the pig’s cock.<br />
<br />
“Squeeee!” Peter grabbed onto the bed, “Oink… Snort! Tiny….!”<br />
<br />
It was like getting a full length blowjob…! The wolf’s tongue teased the entirety of his shaft as his lips pushed around the base of his cock. <br />
<br />
“O-oink! I’m gonna… Ease up Tiny…!” Peter rocked his hips. He was so close…!<br />
<br />
The wolf pulled his head back slowly, “I told you I was good.” Peter’s shaft was still leaking pre when the wolf let go. “Come on, let me finish you.”<br />
<br />
“Oink…? Shouldn’t I be returning the favor?” Peter sat up. He crawled forward on the bed playfully.<br />
<br />
“Arf? I’m fine- I- Awoo…!” Tiny let out a short clipped howl as Peter slid his hoof-capped fingers around the base of his sheath.<br />
<br />
“Woah, I uh- I’m not really sure how wolf dicks work, easy there…!” Tiny arched his back gently.<br />
<br />
“I think I know the basics,” Peter bent down and ran his tongue along the exposed part of Tiny’s shaft.<br />
<br />
The red wolf cock responded immediately. The tapered shaft started to push out of the sheath slowly as Peter gave it more attention. Oink! It smelled <i>amazing</i>…!<br />
<br />
“I just- I’m not very big…!” Tiny rocked his hips in time with Peter’s teasing.<br />
<br />
“Oink…? You’re plenty big Tiny,” Peter buried his snout into the wolf’s furry crotch. He gave the base a nice playful squeeze, “I think you’ve got a knot for Pete’s sake…!”<br />
<br />
“But- Awoooooo!” Tiny tried to protest, but Peter was clearly having fun coaxing some barks out of the canine.<br />
<br />
Peter looked down at Tiny’s shaft curiously. It was starting to get good and hard and… Really it looked fine? Standard six inches? Close to it at least. Then again… Tiny was a massive wolf man at the moment. He looked easily taller than seven feet. Maybe it was a proportion thing?<br />
<br />
Peter eased up finally, gently edging the wolf, “Did you seriously name yourself after your cock?”<br />
<br />
“Arf!” Tiny’s ears shot up. His face went a deep scarlet behind his fur, “I thought I was being clever at the time.”<br />
<br />
“You’re plenty big!” Peter gave his shaft a quick stroke.<br />
<br />
“Arf! I know, but-“ Tiny started again.<br />
<br />
Peter cut him off, “You want me on top?”<br />
<br />
Tiny’s yellow canines went wide, “Uh, I’m the big horny wolf. Aren’t I supposed to be on top?”<br />
<br />
Peter raised an eyebrow, “Nah, I’m the assertive little pig. Get on the bed pup.”<br />
<br />
Tiny’s tail shot straight in the air. He immediately crawled further up into the bed. “If- If you’re sure!”<br />
<br />
“Relax, I got this,” Peter grinned. He slid off the bed and landed on his hooves with a loud clop. He had no idea what the M.O. was at magical masquerade parties were, but he wasn’t surprised to find a box of condoms and a bottle of lube in the nightstand drawer.<br />
<br />
Tiny stretched himself out on the bed as Peter got ready. It was cute seeing him wag so much. He rolled onto his back and spread his legs, then rolled onto his stomach, then back to his back. It was like a dog trying to get comfortable on a pillow. Which Peter supposed wasn’t that far off.<br />
<br />
Peter tore open the condom package with his tusk and gently slid the rubber down over his cock. He looked up at the flopping wolf as he popped open the tube of lube.<br />
<br />
“On all fours big guy,” he snorted in amusement. “Doggy style.”<br />
<br />
“Arf! Right!” Tiny wagged eagerly as he rolled back over one last time.<br />
<br />
Peter smeared some of the lube onto his cock, then gathered a bit more onto his fingers.<br />
<br />
“Oink, I’ve never done a guy with a tail before,” he slid his fingers up under Tiny’s tail, spreading the lube out on his ass.<br />
<br />
“Awoo…! I’ll try not to wag too much,” Tiny barked timidly.<br />
<br />
Peter laughed as he crawled into bed, “You wag as much as you’d like. Just tell me if I’m going to fast.”<br />
<br />
“Arf!” Tiny nodded, his tail wagging straight above his back.<br />
<br />
“You’re such a little puppy in bed,” Peter laughed. Before Tiny could respond, Peter gently probed his rear with one of his lube covered fingers.<br />
<br />
“Awoo!” Tiny’s arms and legs buckled. Between his legs a bit more of his cock started to slide out of his sheath.<br />
<br />
“That was just the warm up,” Peter slid further up onto bed. He lined himself up with Tiny and playfully lifted the wolf’s tail up, “Get ready for the whole hog.”<br />
<br />
Peter slid his cock into Tiny’s waiting ass. The wolf man was tight, but it wasn’t anything Peter couldn’t manage. He pressed gently into Tiny, a small part of his mind noting how fun it was to fuck with an extra thing to hold onto in the back. Tiny let out an eager howl every time Peter teased his tail.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… That’s snort… Oink… Oink…!” Peter tried to tease the wolf, but the experience was making words hard to form.<br />
<br />
“Arf! Deeper! Woof! Grr…! Yes!” Tiny seemed to be having as much trouble forming a sentence as he was.<br />
<br />
Peter finished sliding his cock fully into the wolf. He began to thrust more forcefully into his canine companion, and it wasn’t long until their bodies were moving as one. Peter couldn’t help but notice the mass of his thrusting hips imparting a bit more momentum than usual. Oink…! Had he gotten bigger since they started fooling around?<br />
<br />
The pig pressed his stomach up against the wolf’s back. Tiny’s back drooped down in surprise, but he managed to handle Peter’s heft. The pig leaned down and tried to whisper something teasing into the wolf’s ear, but all that managed to come out was a couple of randy squeals.<br />
<br />
Squeee! They sounded like a couple of horny farm animals. Thankfully it wasn’t hard to tell the wolf was having a good time. Peter reached down and started teasing the wolf’s sheath. Tiny’s cock had fully slid out of the beast’s furry sheath by this point.<br />
<br />
Peter let out a few more grunts as he started to stroke the wolf’s manhood. Tiny panted excitedly in return. It was clear both of their bodies were reaching the limits of what they could handle.<br />
<br />
“Awwwwoooooooo!!!” Tiny threw his head back and made a mess of the bed underneath him. His howl was a startling, primal thing. Peter could feel the reverberations traveling all the way to his own shaft.<br />
<br />
The pig gave a few more hearty thrusts and finally arrived at his own climax. He tried to let out another loud squeal, but he was so out of breath that he just managed a trail of, “Oink, oink, oink…!” as he came inside the wolf.<br />
<br />
Tiny let out a soft moan as Peter finally pulled out of him. The wolf couldn’t stop wagging. He had a huge grin on his muzzle as Peter plopped down on the bed beside him.<br />
<br />
“Arf! Now that was fun,” Tiny rolled over and licked Peter’s cheek.<br />
<br />
Peter half-heartedly pushed the wolf’s face away, “You big puppy.”<br />
<br />
The pig squirmed a bit, sliding off his condom. Tiny let out an amused bark.<br />
<br />
“I was wondering how the piggy managed to avoid making a bigger mess,” Tiny wagged playfully.<br />
<br />
Peter grinned, “Let the record show we’re wallowing in your cum.” He shot the wolf a playful wink.<br />
<br />
The two hovered in that moment for a good long while. Peter realized he was panting more loudly than the canine at this point. Oink! He was… really out of shape.<br />
<br />
Finally it became apparent that Tiny’s fur was really starting to get soaked by their mess.<br />
<br />
“Come on,” the wolf sat up, pointing to the attached bathroom, “Taking a shower can be a fun away of exploring your new body.”<br />
<br />
“Oink, I’m pretty sure I got a thorough tour of yours,” Peter slid out of the bed with a loud clop. His own little corkscrew tail was wagging as he chased after the wolf, “We should do this again some time.”<br />
<br />
Tiny’s ears perked, “I’ll make sure you get an invite for the next party.”<br />
<br />
Peter looked up at Tiny as he started to get the shower running, “Next quarter? We could always just swap phone numbers?”<br />
<br />
Tiny blinked. He clearly hadn’t been thinking along those lines. “Arf! Right!”<br />
<br />
Peter squeezed Tiny’s sheath as he passed the wolf and entered the shower, “I want to see if you howl without a mask on.”<br />
<br />
“Awoo, now how can I pass on an offer like that?” Tiny grinned as he followed after Peter.<br />
<br />
Shower logistics were always “fun” with two people. It turns out things were even trickier when one of them was taller than the shower head and had a tail swishing behind them. Peter wasn’t exactly able to just press against the wall to take up less space either. But they managed to clean each other off and get dressed.<br />
<br />
Oink! Their clothes had shifted a bit in their absence. Peter’s shirt had indeed grown two sizes. Tiny’s outfit was updated as well, but there seemed to be a limit as to how long you could tailor blue jeans. A good deal of his ankles and shins were showing.<br />
<br />
Peter wiggled his smart phone as Tiny finished getting dressed, “Seriously, let me shoot you a text.”<br />
<br />
Tiny’s tail slid through a tail hole in his pants. It curled straight in the air, “Alright, alright.”<br />
<br />
The two traded numbers with a pair of texts. Naturally they had to save each other as “Peter Pigsty” and “Tiny Wolf” in each other’s phones. Their true names still escaped them.<br />
<br />
“So, shall we get back to the party?” Tiny walked toward the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
“Oink! Uh-“ Peter snorted, sniffing himself curiously, “Do we still smell like sex?”<br />
<br />
“Arf? It’s been an hour, half the party does,” Tiny unlocked the door and headed out into the hall.<br />
<br />
Peter quickly clopped after him. Waiting an appropriately discrete distance away at the staircase landing was a satyr, a bunny-man, and some kind of lanky weasel. They were clearly waiting for a room to open up.<br />
<br />
“Good thing we changed the sheets,” Tiny snickered as they ran past, “So… what now?”<br />
<br />
Peter grinned, “Have you ever met royalty before?”</p>
