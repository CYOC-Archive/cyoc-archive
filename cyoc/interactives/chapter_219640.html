<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours have passed, the sun has set and two were sat on Lila’s couch just talking. Chatting. It felt nice. Although they’d missed the better part of ten years, there was still a lot to talk about, even discovering things that these future versions of themselves had done in their absence.<br />
<br />
Of course, Lila hadn’t been drinking. She’d never really drank, yet she had many fuzzy memories of going to clubs and getting completely hammered, hungover the next day. But being pregnant, she made sure she didn’t.<br />
William on the other hand was already a fraction of the way through the bottle of wine. He wasn’t too drunk, but not sober enough to drive. Let alone make a wish without thinking about it first. He was lucky he’d already used his wish.<br />
<br />
“So you’re still single, huh?” Lila asked,<br />
“Yeah yeah, I know,” William said, his innate awkwardness less apparent due to the tipsy state he was in, “I’ve tried, but hookups are all I can manage,” he admitted, “I mean, girls think it’s cute that I have a ‘tiny’ penis…”<br />
“I’m sure it’s not that small, just in comparison,”<br />
“Oh you have NO idea,” William giggled, Lila couldn’t help but be curious. She knew it was wrong especially since William wasn’t sober, but she had to ask,<br />
“Can I see it?”<br />
“I told you before!” William said, his eyebrows furrowing, “I’m not showing you my cock!” He stumbled,<br />
“I don’t wanna do anything, I just… I’ve seen a lot of really huge penis’… I’ve never actually seen one before you made that wish,”<br />
“Well…” William hesitated, “whatever,” he said. Without really thinking about it, he pulled down his shorts and revealed his pretty undersized penis, “I’m not… it looks better when it’s hard, I promise,” he said. As Lila was just analysing it, he pulled his underwear back up, “that’s enough of that,” he said, chuckling to himself,<br />
“Th-thanks…” Lila said, awkwardly,<br />
“Whatever,” William said, only really just hitting him what he’d done, “d-did I seriously just do that?” He said, “shit,” he said, grabbing his glass of wine and drinking more.<br />
<br />
“Willaim,” Lila started, “I’m going to offer you my wish, okay?” She said,<br />
“WHAT!?” Willaim replied, almost spitting out his wine,<br />
“I’m the reason we’re here, and as far as I can tell, you’ve had to deal with ten years of… shit because of me,”<br />
“Pffft… like what,”<br />
“Well I mean… I made you fat. I didn’t fix your penis to the rest of the world. I know it wasn’t technically ‘you’, but I still kinda messed with your life,”<br />
“It’s whatever, seriously,” William said, going for more wine. Lila grabbed his arm, stopping him,<br />
“William.” She said sternly, he lowered his arm, placing the glass back on the table, “whatever you want. I’ll wish for it. Then tomorrow, we can work out a way to get you back home,”<br />
“Me?” He said, puzzled, “what about you?”<br />
“I… I don’t know if I want to get back home,” Lila said, “I… I’m pregnant. I have a fiancé. I mean in these ten years I’ve done a lot, and I think… I really wanna be a mom,”<br />
“Really?” William said, “I’m not gonna ask you to give that up… but we both lost ten years. I’d feel guilty if you gave me that time back, but not yourself,”<br />
<br />
The two were silent for a few minutes. It was an awkward, almost painful silence. Neither knew what to do. Then Lila had some kind of idea. It wasn’t the best, but the more she thought about it, the more it made sense,<br />
“What if…” Lila started, “what if we wished that we were back, but everything here is the same?” She suggested,<br />
“What?”<br />
“Like… this. Everything that’s happened over the last ten years, we don’t undo it. We make a wish that says this version of you…” she hesitated, “…and me. They live on, like they have been doing for the last ten years. And I guess we go back to where we left off… or a little earlier, before you made that wish,”<br />
“I guess…” William tried to comprehend it in his head, but he wasn’t really able to. However he understood what she was suggesting, “it’s a good idea, but we can’t get it wrong,”<br />
“I know, that’s why I’m suggesting we make that wish tomorrow,” she said, “and tonight, you can wish for whatever you want. Something that’ll stay with this version of you. Maybe make his life better,”<br />
“Yeah…” William said, “that’s a good idea. I have no idea. I mean I could ask for a muscular, sexy, big dick body…”<br />
“You sure?”<br />
“No no!” William said, “I don’t know. I don’t want that. A part of me has just gotten used to this body. Maybe something else. Something that’ll make his life not so miserable and repetitive. All of these memories, they’re just hookups, getting drunk, and hookups again,”<br />
“Then wish for something to make it better,”<br />
“But what could I wish for?” William asked, truly unsure,<br />
<br />
“A soulmate?” Lila suggested.<br />
William almost felt himself sober up,<br />
“Huh?”<br />
“S-someone… perfect. Someone who is your exact perfect person, who loves you just as much you love them,”<br />
“That’s… that’s a lot,” William said,<br />
“I just mean like bump into them,” Lila said, “maybe say you meet her this year, this month? Even this week could work. It’ll be natural, we don’t even have to create her,”<br />
“But who… who would she be?”<br />
“I have no idea. That’s the point!” Lila said, “I’ve never met my fiancé, but I know just how much I love him,”<br />
“Is he your soulmate?” William asked. Lila hesitated yet again,<br />
“I-I…” she stuttered, “I’m not sure…” she said, “probably,”<br />
“So why not wish we both meet our soulmates!?” William said, “why just me!”<br />
“B-because I’m pregnant,” Lila said. William stopped, he looked at her belly then looked away, “it’s complicated, and I don’t care if he’s my soulmate. I know I love him,” she said,<br />
“I know,” William said, “I’m sorry for pushing it,”<br />
“It’s fine,” the two were silent for a few moments, “do you want me to make the wish?”<br />
“Y-yeah…” William said, “wish that I’ll meet my soulmate, and that I’ll do everything correctly… that I won’t mess it up,”<br />
“Okay,” Lila said, she sat up straight, “I wish that in the next… month, after the wish we make tomorrow, this version of William will meet his soulmate, and that he’ll do everything right. He won’t mess it up. He’ll be as perfect for her as she is for him,” Lila said. She smiled.<br />
<br />
“I guess there’s no way to tell if it worked, huh,” William said, looking a little sad,<br />
“Well there’s one way,” Lila said, she looked at the clock, still only nine o’clock, “I wish William has an absolutely HUGE cock!!”<br />
“HUH!” He yelped. He looked down… but felt nothing, “god…” he said, his heart beating fast, “g-guess it did work,” he joked.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
The two spent the rest of the night talking, chatting, and really getting to know what had happened in these ten years. Discovering it for themselves as they told stories after stories. They laughed, almost cried, and as the night came to an end, William found himself drifting off to sleep as Lila stood in the kitchen, pouring herself a glass of water.<br />
<br />
She walked back in to find William completely passed out. She grabbed a blanket and put it on top of him. She would’ve stayed in the living room with him, but with her pregnancy, she really didn’t want to risk anything. She made her way to her bedroom, throwing on a pair of pyjamas, settling herself into bed, and just laying. Thinking.<br />
<br />
She didn’t want to give up everything. Her idea, to let this version of her live while she could experience everything she missed. She wanted to return to her life. But every moment that passed, she felt more and more comfortable in this body. In this world. Everything seemed more and more natural. Given three days, maybe even less… she’d probably be too comfortable to leave. Maybe she’d even had her babies. She’d be a mom.<br />
She wanted to. Desperately. But she couldn’t, especially since she’d committed to it through her wish.<br />
As she thought, more and more, she felt herself slowly but surely fall asleep.</p>
