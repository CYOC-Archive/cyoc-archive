<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackson, give me the ring back now. I need to turn back into the grown up so there is someone here to look after you both like you mom asked for the weekend,” Oliver said in his childish voice, trying as best as he could to sound somewhat authoritative. <br />
<br />
“Jackson, just give Uncle Ollie the ring back. He was just trying to show us a magic trick and make us laugh. Now let him turn himself back. After all, he’s right, there should really be a grown up here,” Conner told his brother.<br />
<br />
Jackson looked at the ring in his hand and then back up at his now 5 year old uncle. A mischievous smirk began appearing on his face.<br />
<br />
“You know Conner, you might be onto something.”<br />
<br />
“I am?” Conner said almost surprised that his brother might actually be listening to him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we should probably have a grown up here this weekend. But who says it has to be uncle Ollie?!” Jackson replied.<br />
<br />
Almost in unison, both Conner and Oliver looked at one another with panicked looks.<br />
<br />
“Jackson, give me the ring this minute!” Oliver shouted. <br />
<br />
As his uncle basically begged him for the ring, Jackson walked around behind the couch and saw his uncle’s clothes laying on the ground from when he went behind the couch for his “trick.” <br />
<br />
“Jackson, what are you doing.” Oliver said panicked as he raced around the corner to find his nephew picking through the pile of clothes he had abandoned in order to perform his trick. “Stop, what are you doing?!” <br />
<br />
Oliver ran up to try to stop Jackson from picking through the clothes just as he pulled his boxers from the pile.<br />
<br />
“Gimme those!” Oliver said trying to swipe them from Jackson’s hand. <br />
<br />
“What’s a matter, Uncle Ollie? Don’t want to be the only one doing magic tricks?”<br />
<br />
“Jackson, you can’t. Just give me my ring and boxers now.” Oliver said pleading with his 10 year old nephew.<br />
<br />
“Sit down Uncle Ollie, you’re not changing my mind and if you can’t tell you’re in no position to try to tell me what to do.” <br />
<br />
Oliver sulked knowing he was right. He was dumb enough to turn himself into a kid and now he was defenseless against his nephew. He cringed thinking about that could happen if Jackson put the ring and boxers on at the same time, but there was nothing he could do in his current state.<br />
<br />
“Jackson, I’m begging you please just give me the ring. Then if you want to play with it, I’ll let you.”<br />
<br />
“No way. I’m about you show you a trick uncle Ollie.”<br />
<br />
With that, Jackson slipped the ring on his finger. He then proceeded to take off his shirt and shorts. He walked behind the couch and then tossed his briefs out to the side. Once he had the oversized boxers on he walked out from the couch.<br />
<br />
It was a humorous sight as the boxers were far too large far too large for Jackson. But that was about to change. <br />
<br />
“Why isn’t it wor—“ Jackson stopped midsentence as he felt a weird sense of verigo, the sign the transformation was about to begin.<br />
<br />
Jackson felt a tingling sensation in his calves. He planted his feet firmly, and his calves began to grow. Slowly but surely, inch by inch. He moaned as his thick, defined muscle piled itself onto his lower legs. The muscle now protruded out the back of his legs massively.<br />
<br />
The growth next moved up his legs to his quadriceps. The already defined muscle began to expand, layers and layers of hard muscle piling on.<br />
<br />
He felt a tingle in his upper stomach as a line appeared down his stomach. At the top, just below his chest, two cinder blocks emerged from his stomach. Another row emerged below it, and another, and another. He stared in awe at his 8 pack abs l.<br />
<br />
His small pecs began to expand, bigger and bigger. He laughed as his back widened. His traps expanding, and his neck thickening greatly.<br />
<br />
His hands started to grow, becoming heavier. The growth moved up his forearms as they swelled. He gasped as his biceps and triceps expanded as well, nearing 20&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hair sprung up on his chest, and a treasure trail down his abdomen. His face transformed to that of a charming, steely man with his stubble growing in on his cut jawline.<br />
<br />
Finally the transformation stopped.<br />
<br />
Jackson  still couldn&#39;t believe what was going on, but the more he thought about it the more he liked it. 15 minutes ago he was small and weak, now everyone around him would have to look up to him and his comanding frame like that of a pro-bodybuilder. <br />
<br />
&quot;You need to give me that ring back now so we can fix things,” Oliver said, his childish voice quivering as the gravity of the situation sat in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who says I want to go back to being a little weakling? I mean look at me, I&#39;ve got to be like 6&#39;2&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;5 actually,&quot; Oliver mumbled his breath <br />
<br />
Jackson  loved in the movies when the action heroes bounced their pecs. But he had never had pecs before, he wondered how hard it was. His first few tries were rather comical but suddenly he finally got the hang of it. This was so awesome, Jackson had the biggest pecs he&#39;s ever seen and he was bouncing them like he’d always had them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that,&quot; Oliver yelled. &quot;We need to fix things now!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Pipe down little dude, why would I let you take back these amazing muscles from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson began examining his big hands and arms, his large pecs, and his stunning abs which he ran his fingers down taking in the more-than-impressive cuts of his abs. He then placed his hands behind his head and starts grinding his stonewall abs, before lifting his arms perpendicular to his body and doing a double bicep pose, the veins in his now massive arms pulsating as he flexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woooooooooooow, this is amazing! I look like a freaking superhero but even better,&quot; Jackson exclaimed, smiling as he continued to flex his new, huge muscles. &quot;Here, take a video of me flexing these bad boys,&quot; Jackson said handing his phone to Oliver. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; a distraught and envious Oliver said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take this video or your never going to get these amazing muscles back,&quot; jacks on threatened, a threat that sounded more intense thanks to his deep manly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Oliver said &quot;it&#39;s the least I can do before you go back to being a normal 12 year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing there in nothing but his underwear, Jackson began flexing his massive new muscles mimicking the poses he used to see bodybuilders in movies do. With each flex his muscles and veins bulged in ways Jackson never new muscles could. He smiled from ear to ear as he showcased his flawless new physique.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was incredible, no wonder you workout so much! I&#39;ve never felt so powerful and alive!&quot;</p>
