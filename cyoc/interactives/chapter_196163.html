<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul’s adoptive dad worked in a local junkyard where abandoned vehicles are often left behind. He often rode one before going to the crusher. And these years of driving, one would realize that every car is different. Some might be heavy at the back. Some take a bit of elbow grease to maneuver. It’s always a surprise when riding a car for the first time. It takes a bit of time to get used to. But for this police vehicle, Paul felt like he drove this car for a very long time. The smell of its leather upholstery is strange yet familiar. He knew when and when to jerk the gear stick whenever he was changing them. He knew where the car’s weight was and how to deal with it. <br />
<br />
Like the car, Paul too was familiar with this body. Even though most of Dale’s memories are still a blur, Paul found himself doing the man’s mannerisms without him noticing. As of now, he’s scratching his ass and sniffing the smell. It smelled bad, but somehow… not really. He realized he was smelling his buttocks by the second time he did it. <br />
<br />
Of all the things Paul could do in this body, he decided to visit a friend. Sebastian Melgren, a friend since high school. He lived in the same town but somewhere in the wealthier district. Both his parents are doctors and they work a few cities over. They are usually gone, leaving Seb to do anything as he pleases. This turned Seb into the couch potato that he is today. At age 16, he never held a job even Paul and his peers were already working full-time in the local fast food during the weekends. <br />
<br />
Paul pulled over the Melgren driveway and blared a second of his siren. He could hear the sound of a television shut down from inside the house. Paul knocked on the door and awaited a reply.<br />
<br />
The door shook and the locks were opened. A pasty boy with brown hair that is swept to the back greeted him with a nervous smile. Paul sniffed the air without him noticing. He recognized that stench from everywhere. It’s weed. Although, the smell had already faded so hours must have passed since he took his blunt.<br />
<br />
“How can I help you, officer?” Seb asked. Paul swore he heard him gulp a huge wad.<br />
<br />
“We’ve received a report about a certain Sebastian Melgren. Is that you?” Seb nodded. “They said that you’re dealing with illegal drugs, and I’m here to conduct a search.”<br />
<br />
By now, Seb didn’t just gulp. His eyeballs rolled backward and his pasty complexion grew whiter than snow. His temple is sweating bullets. Paul is trying his best not to laugh.<br />
<br />
“Ye- yes, officer.” Seb locked the door first, and Paul heard a scuffle of objects from inside the house. After a full minute, the door opened. If Seb had the right smarts, he’d know that a police officer can’t conduct a search without a warrant. Maybe he forgot in his frantic nervosity. <br />
<br />
Paul entered the home, and it was still as large as he remembered. The smell of weed lingered in the air, but there’s a smell of lemon too. Paul saw where the lemony smell was coming from. It’s from a newly opened car freshener loosely hidden behind the television. <br />
<br />
With Seb trailing behind him, Paul climbed upstairs and into Seb’s bedroom. By now, Seb’s anxiety is through the room. Paul is coming closer and closer to his stash of weed. And behind that thought, Seb is perplexed because the officer seemed to know this house as if he lived here. Paul entered the bedroom and opened a white cabinet where a hidden compartment at the top hides a box of weed. <br />
<br />
“I- I could explain, officer…” Seb said.<br />
<br />
Paul opened the box of weed and saw rolled-up joints with the letter B marked in the wrapping. He recognized that logo from anywhere. It’s from that dealer who cheated him last month. Half of the joints he bought are half-filled with oregano. <br />
<br />
“Didn’t I tell you not to buy from that shitty dealer again?” Paul said. It took him a moment to realize that he wasn’t supposed to say that.<br />
<br />
By the time Paul realized, Seb caught onto the act. “Is this one of Paul’s pranks?” <br />
<br />
Paul circled the room and looked out the window, looking for a sign of Paul. Little did he know that Paul was already in the room with him. <br />
<br />
There’s no sense in hiding the truth anymore. “Okay, you got me,” Paul said.<br />
<br />
“So, where is he?” Seb asked. <br />
<br />
“You’re looking at him.” <br />
<br />
Seb looked at Paul with confused eyes. “I don’t understand. You’re saying I’m looking at Paul but you’re not Paul. Is this another prank? A prank within a prank? Real original PAUL!” Seb shouted Paul’s name while directed at the door. He probably thinks Paul is out the door snickering at his supposed prank.<br />
<br />
“You have a mole on your left butt cheek?” Paul blurted.<br />
<br />
“What!?”<br />
<br />
“You hate parrots because one pecked your left hand during our 4th-grade field trip. You still have a scar on it that looks like a turd. We used to shower together and bump each other’s butt like sumo players. I pushed you too hard once and you slipped and hit your ass on the floor.”<br />
<br />
“Wh- what the hell are you saying?”<br />
<br />
“I’m saying the things only you and I would know. And by I, it’s me! Paul! You’re also a cheap-ass and that’s why you’re buying cheap joints from Big B again. Half the joint you bought from here is Oregano.”<br />
<br />
Seb snatched the box from Paul’s hands and sniffed the joints. They do indeed smell like Oregano. <br />
<br />
“Then that must mean? Paul, is that really you?” Seb circled Paul and pinched his cheeks. For a costume, it looked way too real. A large part of him doesn’t think it’s a costume at all. <br />
<br />
“Yes, it’s me. I found this zipper that lets me turn other people into suits. I could wear them and become like them.” Paul undressed his uniform and showed the golden zipper on his back. Seb pulled down the tab but the suit remained stuck on Paul. When Seb widened the seams, he saw a birthmark on the scapula underneath. The birthmark is shaped like a dog, like what Paul has. He closed the zipper and looked at Paul with wonder in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck! It really is you.” Seb touched Paul’s slightly muscular pecs and realized how hard they are. His fingers trailed in the abs and the circumference of his belly button. For a suit, it didn’t even look and feel like one. “How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell you, it’s fucking amazing. I have these muscles and this man’s identity. His life is somewhat boring but it’s all up in here,” Paul tapped his head. <br />
<br />
“What do you plan to do now?” Seb asked.</p>

What plan does Paul have in mind?</h3>
