<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>For the rest of this week, we'll be having daily posts of Animalian Memories to take care of the backlog of backtracking chapters. If anyone wants to do one, they're welcome. Other present day chapters can still be posted to keep the story moving forward.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the week of the Outbreak...<br />
<br />
Peter was hardly what one would call athletic. In fact, he was pretty much the stereotypical image of a geek: scrawny physique, a pasty complexion that had more than a few zits, slightly crooked teeth that weren&#39;t severe enough to need braces, curly hair of a shade of red that some people would find offensive, and large glasses with lens so thick that they could probably be used as fire glasses. Add to that a severe asthma condition and you had the near-perfect image of a high school geek.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Peter was hardly a popular guy. Girls avoided him like they were magnetically repelled by him and he was very popular target of bullies who loved to play keep-away with his glasses. Not to mention the various times he&#39;s been shoved into lockers and hung by his underwear. He went through sets of underwear the way some people went through batteries. The only companions he had were the other fellow geeks at school. Still, he wanted someone closer. He didn&#39;t have a snowball&#39;s chance of getting a girl, but he could at least settle for a pet. The problem being that some animals were too energetic for him and dealing with them could cause an asthma attack, not to mention a slight intolerance to animal fur.<br />
<br />
Naturally, a reptile was the choice for him. Perhaps a pet reptile would be enough to make him seem a little cooler. But lizards were too likely to run away and snakes scared his mom too much. As such, a turtle was the best option for him and there were four box turtles available for sale at the local pet store. The only problem was that Peter couldn&#39;t decide which of the turtles he wanted. To some people, turtles were just turtles. But Peter could see something special in these little turtles. Not to mention, the owner of the pet store mentioned that they were all from the same clutch. Most reptiles aren&#39;t social creatures and usually went their separate ways after hatching. But Peter couldn&#39;t bear the thought of separating these sisters after they&#39;ve been together so long. So he worked extra hard to earn enough money to buy all four of them.<br />
<br />
Peter walked to the pet store filled with excitement. Soon, he&#39;ll be bringing home four turtles that will care for him as long as they lived, which is pretty long considering they were turtles. However, when he saw the pet store, he got a little concern. It looked like some kind of pandemonium had occurred there. He could see plenty of displays knocked down and the glass terrariums in there were all shattered. Peter was immediately concerned. Who would break into the pet store and break everything? And what happened to the animals?<br />
<br />
Just then, he heard something from the closest alley. It sounded a lot like someone going &#39;psst&#39;. Curious, Peter walked down the alley. &quot;Hello?&quot; he called, &quot;Is someone there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you Peter?&quot; asked a female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, how do you know me?&quot; asked Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve known you for a while,&quot; said another female voice. Then four figures emerged from the shadows. To Peter&#39;s amazement, they all looked like anthropomorphic turtles. Even more surprising was that all four of them were clearly female, as their plastrons curved noticeably around particularly large breasts.<br />
<br />
Peter had read more than a few comic books to guess who these turtle women were. &quot;Oh my gosh, you&#39;re the turtles from the store, aren&#39;t you?&quot; asked Peter, &quot;Does this mean that all of the animals in there have changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, he is a smart one,&quot; said one of the turtles, &quot;I would have thought he&#39;d call us aliens or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did you all mutate? You are mutants, aren&#39;t you?&quot; asked Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not really sure what we are,&quot; said another turtle, &quot;One minute we were ordinary turtles. The next thing we knew, we were growing too large for our terrarium.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us and every other pet in the place,&quot; said another turtle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Except the fishes,&quot; said the second turtle, &quot;They didn&#39;t change. Probably just as well. There would have been way too many of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do you know me?&quot; asked Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve noticed you paying attention to us for quite a long time,&quot; said the fourth turtle, &quot;You seemed so interested in us and yet you never bought any of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I couldn&#39;t decide which one of you I wanted,&quot; said Peter, &quot;I was just coming today to buy all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The turtles all went &#39;aw...&#39; at that. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re so sweet,&quot; said the first turtle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the nicest human we know,&quot; said the fourth turtle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that we know a lot of humans,&quot; said the third.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since you were planning on bringing us home today, how about we go to your house?&quot; asked the second turtle.<br />
<br />
&quot;My house?&quot; asked Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can&#39;t just walk around the streets,&quot; said the first turtle, &quot;People are going to notice us quite a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter could definitely see why. It wasn&#39;t every day that you saw an anthro turtle, let alone one with a big rack. &quot;Ok, we&#39;re not too far actually,&quot; said Peter, turning and leading the turtles.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
On the way home, Peter got to know the turtle sisters better. It was a bit hard to determine how their personalities were different. In fact, it was a bit hard to tell one from another by appearance. But the turtles were very amiable to him. They willing took up the names that Peter was going to give them; Lina, Reva, Dela, and Mara. It was taking a while for Peter to memorize who was who, but he was pretty certain Mara was the one most affectionate towards him. Not that any of the turtles weren&#39;t, but Mara exhibited it the most.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they got to Peter&#39;s house. His parents weren&#39;t home yet, but he still had a key and let the turtles in. &quot;Ok, here we are,&quot; said Peter as he led the turtles to his room, &quot;I&#39;m not sure we have enough room for everybody, but I think it&#39;ll work until we figure out what&#39;s been going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been awfully generous to us,&quot; said Lina.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so thoughtful about keeping us together,&quot; said Reva.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even when we were just turtles,&quot; said Dela.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you accepted us even after we&#39;ve changed,&quot; said Mara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose anyone would have done it,&quot; said Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, not just anyone,&quot; said Dela.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a kind soul would have let us in,&quot; said Lina.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re very grateful to you,&quot; said Reva.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think we know how to repay you,&quot; said Mara.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter was pushed down onto his bed. Before he could say anything, the turtles were all over him, kissing him. Despite their rigid beaks, they weren&#39;t bad kissers. But then, Peter hadn&#39;t ever kissed a girl before. Most girls would run away screaming at the mere suggestion at it. But these four were accepting him for all he was. Little did he know that he was going to become much more than that.<br />
<br />
The turtle girls massaged Peter all over, their dexterous fingers rubbing his bare skin where they could. They soon noticed that his skin was becoming a lot dryer and the muscles beneath them were growing. This only encouraged them to keep going. They removed Peter&#39;s shoes and socks as his feet grew stubby claws. The face they were kissing so much lost its pimply, pasty complexion as scales grew over it. His glasses were removed and tossed aside, which wouldn&#39;t have fit well on the growing beak on his face. His clothes began to grow tighter, but not just because of his increasing muscles and height. A bony exterior was forming around his torso, gaining more mass by the second. This was quickly ripping his clothes apart as it became more solid and tougher. Before long, his clothes were ripped apart completely, showing the large turtle&#39;s shell that now covered his body.<br />
<br />
The turtle sisters backed off to admire Peter&#39;s new body. Peter&#39;s body resembled nothing like the scrawny nerd he was except for his curly red hair. His body was that of a large turtle man. He was rather bulky now and that wasn&#39;t just his shell. His arms and legs were now a lot more muscular and the plastron of his shell defined his muscles very precisely. Even his turtle face looked rather handsome. Peter stood up and looked at himself. He was a lot taller than before. Better than that, he could see quite clearly now and his lungs have never felt better. Peter took a deep breath and said, &quot;This is the most incredible thing to ever happen to me.&quot; His voice sounded deeper, more mature.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not all,&quot; said Mara.<br />
<br />
&quot;We found out something earlier,&quot; said Dela.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something you&#39;re sure to enjoy,&quot; said Reva.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lift your arms up,&quot; said Lina.<br />
<br />
Peter obeyed and lifted his arms above his head. The turtles sisters grasped his shell and started pulling on it. To Peter&#39;s surprise, it started to slide down. He had thought that the shell was part of his skeletal system now, formed of his ribs and spine. But apparently it was removable. Peter stepped out of the shell and looked at himself. The muscular definition his plastron hinted at was not an illusion. He was incredibly buff, probably stronger than most of the guys at school. He felt his chiseled torso, feeling the dry scaly skin. &quot;This is unbelievable,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Then he heard four clunks and girlish giggling. He turned to see that the turtle sisters had also removed their shells. It was a bit hard to see their figures with the bulky shells on, but underneath them were fit, curvaceous bodies. Their breasts were proudly on display, perfect in shape and form even if they had scales. The girls were all giving Peter a lustful look. Peter soon felt pretty lusty himself. He never expected to get laid by a hot woman, let alone four. His new dick soon emerged from his sheath, a lot more impressive than the one he had before. He laid back down on his bed and said, &quot;So, girls, don&#39;t just stand there. Show me how grateful you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter&#39;s first sex session was definitely one to remember. The turtle sisters took turns riding him, kissing him, being licked and suckled by him, and just about every sexual position that Peter could think of. His reptilian body had a lot more stamina that he had guessed and that kept the five of them busy for a long time. Eventually, they all laid down to rest, Peter in the middle with two girls on each side. This was definitely the best day of Peter&#39;s life. He was, of course, curious about how all this happened, but that can wait until later. He wondered how many others were changed. His change was certainly one he didn&#39;t regret. He&#39;d like those guys try to stuff him into a locker now.</p>
