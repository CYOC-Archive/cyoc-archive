<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Davis snored soundly in the wreckage of his bed, the mattress holding him even if the bedframe had been unable to. At eight feet tall and over 600 pounds of rock solid brawn, he had gone beyond simply built, and on to the realm of legendary. It was quite a change from the somewhat mousy archivist and data entry technician he had been just a few hours earlier. <br />
<br />
Davis had forgotten that his boyfriend, Tom, was supposed to come over that evening, to spend Saturday night together. He didn't wake as Tom put his copy of the key in the apartment door, and came in, calling out, &quot;Davis, I'm here!&quot; Only when Tom closed the door somewhat loudly (due to his arms being full, as he was carrying two bags of groceries) did Davis begin to stir. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tom? That you?&quot; came Davis' deep, thick voice from the bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's me,&quot; Tom replied, as he set the groceries down on Davis' kitchen counter. &quot;You feeling sick or something? Your voice is different...&quot; Tom walked back to the bedroom, and then stopped, nearly falling over in shock, his eyes wide at the scene before him: a massive musclegod of a man, lying nude on the wreckage of Davis' bed. <br />
<br />
Slowly, Davis sat up, and Tom took a step back, as he began to appreciate just how tall the huge man before him was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- who... who are you?&quot; Tom croaked at last, his head feeling light. <br />
<br />
Davis grinned sheepishly. &quot;It's, uh, me, Davis.&quot; He reached up to scratch the back of his head. His massive bicep bulged freakily, round and hard and bigger than his head. His lat flared outward, thick and sweeping. Tom gulped, and his knees gave out, sending him sinking to the floor. <br />
<br />
Davis was up in a flash, rushing over to his lover, picking him up in his strong arms, enveloping the man in hard, powerful flesh. He gently carried him to the ruined bed, and laid him on the mattress.  &quot;For real, Tom. It's me, Davis. It's... well, it's complicated...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding!&quot; Tom managed to squeak, looking up at the massive brute with a face that looked like Davis'. Tom reached out, tentatively, and put his hand against one of Davis' massive pecs. Tom traced its outrageous contours, somewhat nervously at first, but then with a bit more confidence. Davis grinned, and flexed his chest, the huge slabs of muscle exploding into striated masses of raw power, thick and dangerous. Tom gasped as he felt the massive pectoral muscle change, becoming hard and unyielding. Then he grinned, and resumed his journey, exploring the deep striations that ran across the muscle, heading down toward Davis' proud nipple. Tom gave the fleshy knob a good pull, twisting it around, and was rewarded with a deep-throated groan from his massive boyfriend. Davis leaned in, his lips meeting Tom's, his kiss passionate and hungry. Tom reciprocated, devouring Davis, his hands alternating between removing his clothes and exploring the outrageous contours of Davis' huge new form. <br />
<br />
Davis, for his part, was finding that his new body seemed built for sex. His arousal was greater than anything he had ever felt before. Tom gasped when he saw the big balls and proportionately large cock, which had grown to match Davis' new size, now easily a foot long and quite thick. &quot;Be gentle, Mister Giant...&quot; Tom purred, half-joking, half-serious, &quot;or at least at first. Once you've got me loose...&quot; he gave Davis a lust-filled wink and grin, as he applied lube to the big man's dick. <br />
<br />
Davis grinned back, as his engorged rod swelled, veins prominent along the thick shaft. He positioned himself at Tom's hole, and began to push in, the big head seemingly too large for entry. Tom grunted, relaxing, and gritted his teeth as he begged, &quot;Do it, Davis. Come on big man...&quot; Davis was only too happy to comply, using his immense strength to power his muscledick in. Tom gasped, and clutched Davis' huge arms for support, feeling his ass violated by such a big cock. Davis eased up, giving Tom a chance to adapt to having so much meat abusing his hole. &quot;Fuck that thing is big...&quot; Tom panted, &quot;...feels even bigger than it looks...&quot; Tom could feel the pain ease, and his excitement grow. He reached up and gripped Davis' huge pecs, which loomed above him, plump with power. &quot;Deeper, big man. Shove that big thing in!&quot; Tom whispered, chewing his lower lip seductively, as he grabbed Davis' big nips and gave them a cruel twist. <br />
<br />
Davis grunted like a mad animal as Tom's abuse of his big chest sent shocks of pleasure through him. He pushed in harder, deeper, sending his big cock far into Tom, making the smaller man squeal with excitement. Davis bucked hard, slamming his tool in forcefully, as Tom howled beneath him, babbling obscenities and encouraging words interchangeably. Davis could feel his cock swell a bit further, in expectation, as his balls churned eagerly. He pumped away hard and fast now, his powerful glutes and legs slamming his big dick home over and over, while his big arms fenced Tom in, preventing the smaller man from being shoved aside by such forceful thrusts. Tom groaned and yelped as he felt Davis' oversized dick roughly use his ass, the big cockhead mashing his prostate, sending hammerblows of ecstasy through him. He didn't know what part of Davis' massive body to to grab, so he just went for whatever came to hand, sometimes gripping a massive arm, othertimes a huge slab of pec, or a freakish lat, or some other thick bit of hard, powerful muscle. And then he felt the huge ram inside him shudder and shake, hard as a rock, and then explode, sending a huge torrent of cum racing through him, the big rod shaking and shuddering like mad, stimulating Tom's ass like nothing before. Above him, Davis was bellowing, the big man's thick neck flared as he threw his head back in ecstasy. Tom's own dick was going mad, shooting his cum onto Davis' powerful stomach, the smaller man driven over the edge by the sensation of Davis' spasm-wracked cock filling him with hot, thick cream.</p>
