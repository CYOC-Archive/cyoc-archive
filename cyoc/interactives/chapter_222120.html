<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pinky the anthro pink dragoness & Sapphire the anthro blue dragoness were sitting on the roof of the school after hours. This has been their normal hangout spot for 6 months now. Pinky could tell something was bothering Sapphire & asked &quot;What&#39;s bothering you?&quot; The blue dragoness sighed replying &quot;It feels weird only hanging out only as dragonesses all these months. Not being with you as my human self.&quot; Pinky puzzled asked &quot;How so?&quot; Sapphire answered &quot;Sense I&#39;m not allowed to be around you as a human it feels wrong. I befriended you as a human; not as a dragon.&quot; The pink dragoness thought about that for a bit & quickly came up with a solution. Pinky put a hand on Sapphire&#39;s leg & told her &quot;I&#39;m ending my friendship with Brad.&quot; Sapphire asked surprised looking at Pinky &quot;You don&#39;t want to be friends with me anymore?&quot; The pink dragoness put a hand on Sapphire&#39;s cheek (if you could call it that) & told her with a smile &quot;I&#39;m friends with you Sapphire.&quot; Sapphire was confused. Pinky explained to her &quot;Sense you can only be with like this not your human self then I only be friends with you like this.&quot; Sapphire nodded in agreement saying &quot;Ok that works.&quot; That settled the two dragoness went back to relaxing together. Sapphire after a few minutes spoke &quot;You heard of the new process of Animal Costume Sealing?&quot; Pinky asked puzzled &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; The blue dragoness explained &quot;They came up with 4 months ago. It&#39;s a process an Animal Costume User can have done to them. It permanently seals them in their Animal Costume. They can never take their Animal Costume off again to be human again.&quot; Pinky shocked asked &quot;Why would anyone want that?&quot; Sapphire told Pinky &quot;Because some people want to be animals period. Only.&quot; Pinky thought [Like me wanting to be an anthro dragon only.] Sapphire then told Pinky &quot;When I turn 18 I&#39;m getting the Sealing.&quot; Pinky surprised asked &quot;Are you serious? Why would you become an anthro dragoness permanently?&quot; Sapphire answered &quot;Over the last 4 months I have been my human self only when I&#39;m at school. I have actually been arriving at school as my anthro blue dragoness self. I been keeping my human clothes in a bag my locker at school. I been changing out of my costume & into my human clothes there & then stuffing my costume into my gym bag & into my locker. Then when I&#39;m about to leave the school for the day I reverse the process & leave as my dragoness self. Frankly I&#39;m not Brad but Sapphire outside of school now. I&#39;m been Sapphire more than Brad for the last 4 months.&quot; Pinky thought about what she told her & asked &quot;So have you been Brad only at school over the last 4 months?&quot; Sapphire answered &quot;No. And sense I can&#39;t be Sapphire on the property I had been staying in a cabin our family owns in the woods behind our house. It&#39;s not on the property so I&#39;m allowed there. I actually moved in there.&quot; Pinky asked &quot;Are you happy living like that?&quot; Sapphire smiled &quot;Actually yes. I get to be Sapphire for as long as I want.&quot; Pinky thought about that & asked curious &quot;Do you only want to be Sapphire the anthro blue dragoness?&quot; Sapphire answered annoyed &quot;I think by all I told you it should be clear.&quot; Pinky thought about that too & then she began to wonder something. The pink dragoness asked &quot;Can a legal guardian have the Sealing done to someone under 18?&quot; Sapphire lit up as she remembered &quot;Yes a legal guardian can do that. I got to go home & get that done right now.&quot; Sapphire spread her wings, jumped off the roof & began flying for home.<br />
Brad&#39;s dad Max was out in the front yard getting the mail when Sapphire landed in front of him. He looked at the anthro blue dragoness with anger telling her &quot;You know the rules. No being this on the property.&quot; Sapphire replied &quot;I want you to have me Sealed so I can be this permanently.&quot; At that point Brad&#39;s mom Beth came outside & had heard that. Beth answered firmly &quot;No.&quot; Sapphire began begging as she kept saying &quot;No.&quot; After a few minutes Sapphire was down on knees begging in tears for the process. Max finally told Sapphire &quot;I&#39;ll take you to get Sealed.&quot; Sapphire asked shocked &quot;You will?&quot; Beth replied in bewildered anger &quot;You can&#39;t be serious? You going to help Brad permanently be that thing?&quot; Max replied to that helping Sapphire up &quot;This is Brad now. He stopped being a human months ago. She choose to be an animal an anthro dragoness. I am just doing what makes sense.&quot; Beth realizing she was defeated but still trying to win informed Sapphire &quot;You do this & you won&#39;t ever be allowed back on the property. We will disown you.&quot; As Max lead Sapphire to the car said &quot;I have been living in that cabin as you know. So I don&#39;t care.&quot; Sapphire & Max got in the car & were off. They didn&#39;t speak at all on the way to the store. The employee at the store saw the anthro blue dragoness (naked of course) enter with a man who was Max. The dragoness informed the employee that she was there to be Sealed. That she knew what that meant. Max informed the employee sense the dragoness was underage he&#39;d be signing the consent for it. The paperwork was signed & the Sealing process was done to Sapphire. She actually felt she was permanently an anthro dragoness. After they left the store Sapphire told Max &quot;Sense I&#39;m permanently this now I won&#39;t be wearing anything ever again. I have no use for my clothes or any clothes anymore.&quot; Max kinda meanly said to her &quot;Get away from you beast. And leave me alone.&quot; Confused Sapphire asked &quot;What?&quot; Max replied &quot;I don&#39;t know you beast. I don&#39;t want to associate with an animal that doesn&#39;t even attend school.&quot; It took all of a few seconds for the blue dragoness to get that. She spread her wings with a silent &quot;Thanks.&quot; & then took flight. Max thought with a groan [You made your choice to be an anthro dragoness; an animal.] As he got back in the car he realized that maybe just maybe that pink anthro dragoness he befriended years ago had made him decide to be a dragoness like her.<br />
Pinky the anthro pink dragoness was sitting on the roof of the school when Sapphire landed next to her & sat down. &quot;I did it. I got Sealed. I am Sapphire period from now on.&quot; Pinky didn&#39;t know what to say to that. &quot;And what&#39;s more Max won&#39;t enroll me in school as a dragoness. Like you I don&#39;t go to school anymore.&quot; It was true. Pinky stopped attending school right after Brad wasn&#39;t allowed to so much as talk to her at school. No one really cares if an anthro even attends school anyway. &quot;So we can hang out whenever we want?&quot; Pinky asked curious. &quot;Yep. And sense I am permanently Sapphire I&#39;m not ever allowed on my Max or Beth&#39;s property. So I can stay over at your place for however long I want.&quot; Pinky asked surprised &quot;You mean it?&quot; Sapphire answered nodding &quot;Yep.&quot; The two dragoness decided right there that Sapphire would spend the night at her house. They flew to Pinky&#39;s house & landed. Before they went inside Pinky asked &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we call your parents & check that it is ok with them?&quot; Sapphire replied to that &quot;I am Sapphire the anthro blue dragoness. I don&#39;t have parents to call.&quot; A bit confused Pinky asked &quot;What?&quot; Sapphire told her in a whisper &quot;When I permanently became Sapphire my parents told me that sense I wasn&#39;t human or male I&#39;m not their son Brad.&quot; The pink dragoness quickly understood that & whispered back &quot;Cool. And by the way my mom & brother don&#39;t know you are Brad. I never told them. They think you&#39;re a natural born like me & my bro are.&quot; Sapphire whispered back &quot;I am Sapphire the anthro blue dragoness permanently now. Brad the human male no longer exists.&quot; The 2 dragoness entered the house together.<br />
The end of this Tale. <br />
