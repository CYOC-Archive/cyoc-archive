<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I couldn’t help but grin as I lowered Ethan down to the ground.<br />
<br />
There was no way I could resist getting hard watching my best friend’s handsome, well-muscled body as it move. It was like he was made perfectly to cater to my own desires. A flitting thought that he might actually be exactly that was quickly dismissed.<br />
<br />
Ethan got up off the floor, stretching himself on tippy-toepads, giving me a good view of his awesome body. His silver and black fur glistened with sweat, showing off his muscles. The wolf saw me watching and gave his ass a shaky, grinning at me over his shoulder. <br />
<br />
As I blushed, he grabbed his black shirt off the ground and slipped it on, the fabric clinging tightly to his form, emphasizing the curves of his body. The wolf took his time pulling on his shorts, adjusting them to fit properly over the dildo that was still lodged in his ass. Then, finally, he placed his tail through the hole in the back of his pants.<br />
<br />
Ethan grabbed his small glasses from a nearby shelf and adjusted them to fit neatly on his muzzle, giving him a cute, nerdy look. They highlighted his brilliant amber eyes. The wolf strode over to me and gave me a hug.<br />
<br />
“Sadly, our time is up. I have to hit the gym to get my reps up for the game.” Ethan said, leaning in for a kiss.<br />
<br />
“Wait, really?” I pulled back, feeling a little hurt and disappointed. “But I thought we had another hour? There’s so much more I want to learn about.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know you’re a very hands-on learner. Don’t worry, I have someone else coming in a few minutes.” Ethan grinned and pat my back. “He’s almost as good as I am. It’s hard to find someone who is eager to teach such a… well-endowed guy like you.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but blush at that remark. Mroo! I was hung like a bull!<br />
<br />
“Alright, fine,” I said, and smiled shyly. “How about that final goodbye kiss before you leave, then?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” The handsome wolf said, leaning in as he hugged me tight and coaxed my mouth open in a long, loving French kiss.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but moan, feeling Ethan’s tongue exploring my mouth, mingling with my thick tongue. Our bulges rubbed together sensuously. I couldn’t help but inhale his scent, my nostrils flaring as I got a good whiff of the wolf’s masculine musk. My dick grew rigid in my shorts and I felt his own erection rubbing against mine.<br />
<br />
But, after a minute, we broke apart. Ethan gave me a final wink before picking up his gym bag and leaving. He paused at the door.<br />
<br />
“Chuck is going to be here in half an hour.” Ethan said over his shoulder. “He’s a human, so you should probably take a shower before he gets here.”<br />
<br />
And then he was gone.<br />
<br />
I watched the wolf leave, still feeling incredibly aroused. With a sigh, I picked up my own gym bag-which I couldn’t recall having, but whatever-and walked out of our private room. Strangely, I couldn’t recall ever coming to the Lupinarium, but maybe I should have.<br />
<br />
There were many private rooms just like the one I had just left. I looked in through the windows that weren’t blocked by shutters as I made my way to the bathroom. There were many students jerking off, bare naked, or jerking each other off or trying out dildos and other sex toys that I saw could be rented at the front desk.<br />
<br />
I marveled as I walked past shelves lined with onaholes, dildos, and life-sized human dolls, all with different builds. Glass cases contained ‘advanced’ sex toys, including one called Big Hoss Hank the Horse, which looked very realistic, and one of the only anthro-specific sex toys I had seen so far in the Lupinarium.<br />
<br />
The entryway to the bathroom was plastered in posters of porn stars, all of them in various suggestive poses, some of them having cocks that could even rival mine!<br />
<br />
I smirked, cupping my bulge proudly, and clopped into the tiled bathroom. There were showers here, and a towel rack with unused towels on it. I took one, hanging it up on my stall, and stepped in. From my bag, I pulled my specially formulated shampoo for hide-hair and got lathered up.<br />
<br />
The hot, steamy water rinsed the cum and sweat from my fur.  I could feel the stink wash off me with the bubbles, leaving me smelling much better. Honestly, that much musk kinda grossed me out. Mroo! I was so stinky!<br />
<br />
I turned the shower off, toweled myself dry, then polished my horns and arranged the tufts of tousled hair between them into something stylish. That done, I sprayed myself down with an odor-neutralizer and hoped that it would stave off my barnyard scent for a few hours. On hot days, it would wear off much quicker. Pulling on a clean pair of clothes, I walked back outside.<br />
<br />
Since I still had… I glanced at my phone… twenty minutes left until this Chuck person showed up, I continued my exploration of the Lupinarium.<br />
<br />
I garnered fewer looks of disgust and horror now that I was freshly showered. My ears waggled happily as the cool air conditioning blew through my clean fur. Mrrooo! So fresh and so clean! Some passing students gave me looks and I realized I was lowing out-loud and not just in my mind. I blushed but my boney tail wagged .<br />
<br />
“Wow,” I said out-loud, “I really need to come here more often. But where’s the gear for the anthros?”<br />
<br />
I continued to browse, curious if they had any anthro posters or magazine covers. Everything from the oldest porn magazine to the most recent had literally zero anthro representation in them. Was I really so unique? The thought made me uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
Growing frustrated with my lack of success, I decided to give up and just peek into the private study rooms. <br />
<br />
I saw some of my classmates in rented rooms. They were all doing pretty well from the looks of it, running through different dildos and sex positions. Then I saw two guys having a bit of trouble and stopped to take a closer look.<br />
<br />
There were two guys in the room. One was a blonde-haired twink who was looking at an assortment of dildos on the shelf on the wall with more than a little trepidation. He seemed incapable of picking one, his hand reaching out, hesitating, then withdrawing. Behind the twink was a fat brown-haired guy struggling to get into the harness. He kept adjusting the straps while keeping his legs closed, like he was trying to hide his dick.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, seriously!” The fat guy threw the straps to the gorund in frustration. “I don’t know how the other guys are so used to this! It’s such a fucking hassle! Come on, Drake, why don’t we just go back to our room and play CoD.”<br />
<br />
“Nah, Matt, we need to do this to help our GPA.” Drake replied as he randomly grabbed a dildo and an onahole. <br />
<br />
He appeared to be guessing as to which was right for the two of them. I thought he looked confident in his choice… which was bad, since his choices for two absolute beginners sucked. The dildo was too big and the onahole… well, he wasn’t supposed to use one for the test. <br />
<br />
Drake held a ten-inch vibrator in his hands and looked over at the fat guy. “Plus we’re both 20 and still virgins. Let’s just get this over with, man.” <br />
<br />
Matt, the fat one, stared at the big dildo with his eyes wide in horror. “Uh, can we try something a bit… smaller?”<br />
<br />
I snorted, rolling my eyes as I watched the geeks. <br />
<br />
They just wanted to get laid, I understood that perfectly, but this? This was pathetic. Erotica studies were not an easy A, it required someone with the skills and confidence to fuck anyone. It was just embarrassing to watch the two young men struggle like this.<br />
<br />
Wait! Mroo! I could help them out! <br />
<br />
With growing excitement, I grabbed the notebook from my bag and flipped it open. I surreptitiously positioned myself so the two geeks wouldn’t see me and began to write.<br />
<br />
‘Drake and Matt are anthros who are pros when it comes to Erotica. They love to push themselves to their limits.’ I finished writing with a flourish. The words glowed for a moment before fading away. <br />
<br />
I stuck my head around the door in excitement, eager to see what happened next.<br />
<br />
Drake continued looking through the dildos, still pondering what to choose. He scratched his arm, oblivious to the gray fur creeping up from his wrists. Then he picked up a 14-inch dildo that was nearly as thick as a beercan. The young man was about to place it back on the shelf, then paused.<br />
<br />
“This… it’s a bit big, but… maybe I should try it out?” Drake mused, too soft for a human to pick up, but loud enough for a big bull like me to overhear.<br />
<br />
Drake scratched his chest as a nice pelt of fur puffed up between his fingers. He looked down at himself, his shirt vanishing as he did so, while the fur spread across his body. The young man stared in shock as his belly expanded, giving him a beergut, but a few moments later, his shook his head, as though dismissing the extra weight. He returned to examining the 14-inch dildo, checking the list of features on the tag hanging off of it.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see… vibrate, pleasure counter, cum meter…” Drake licked his darkening lips, running his tongue over sharper teeth as the fur reached his face.<br />
<br />
Drake’s mouth pushed out into a small, pointy raccoon muzzle. His ears migrated to the top of his head, twisting into smaller, rounder forms as the fur around his became a cute black mask. With a wriggle of his hips, a ringed tail poofed out a new hole in the back of his pants and his ass cheeks plumped roundly as he settled into his proper anthro form.<br />
<br />
“I wonder if I can fit this down my throat or up my ass…” The new, huskily-built raccoon-man tapped his chin, his voice deeper than before. He was muscular but a bit fat, like a weightlifter during an off-season. Drake looked over at Matt, a look of confusion crossing his face as he watched the fat human struggle with the harness. “Matt? Let’s try this one out. What do you think?”<br />
<br />
Matt paused in his struggle with the harness, ogling the giant dildo for a moment. <br />
<br />
As he stared, his hands moved subconsciously and easily clipped the straps onto his body, like he’d done it a million times. The fat guy looked away from the dildo to a mirror on the wall, where he could see the harness strapped on him perfectly. He grinned, enjoying how the harness emphasized his chest.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess you could try that one,” Matt said, not caring what dildo Drake decided on, all his attention on his reflection now, admiring how it really complimented his rotund form.<br />
<br />
He scratched his ass, not noticing the flabby flesh grow firmer under his fingers as a thick, long, brown-furred tail pushed out between his buttcheeks. Short, dense fur began to cover his butt and the harness grew loose again.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! I thought I’d fixed the damn thing. I hate these cheap-ass harnesses!” Matt grumbled to himself as creamy fur crept up his chest. <br />
<br />
Fat started to melt away from his body, leaving the former human with a swimmer’s build. He adjusted the harness as fur spread across his moobs. They firmed up into tight, meaty pecs as he tightened the harness, the straps highlighting his musculature.<br />
<br />
The new, lithe twunk of an otter took a deep breathe and let out a sigh. His nose wriggled, whiskers twitching as he smelled something musky. Riasing a muscular arm he tentatively sniffed himself, cock tenting the jock he was wearing as it shifted into a leather pouch.The pouch strained, barely able to contain the thick piece of meat within.<br />
<br />
Matt adjusted the straps expertly to ensure he had a full range of movement, his thick tail slapping the ground in excitement as his face pushed out into a blunt otter muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Come on, big boy,” Matt grinned, strapping himself into the sex swing hanging from the ceiling, his short legs spread, exposing his pink pucker. “Hurry up and stick something in me!”<br />
<br />
Drake’s spine popped as the short anthro grew a little taller, his body swelling and growing wider. The new coon strut confidently over to the twunk with the big dildo in hand. <br />
<br />
While Drake was busy applying lube, I sat in the doorway, staring at them. <br />
<br />
I was a little confused as to why they were an otter and a raccoon. Was it because they had wanted to be those animals, like some kind of innate spirit animals or was it based on my own tastes? I couldn’t recall wanting them to become any specific animal, and my preferred body type was ultra-muscular.<br />
<br />
While I was considering the implications of my uses of the book, the otter looked over his shoulder and spotted me standing at the doorway and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“Hey, hold on! That dumb country hick is watching us!” Matt, the otter, said.<br />
<br />
I blinked, taking a step back from the door, feeling a bit hurt. Mroo! I wasn’t a hick!<br />
<br />
Drake turned, glowering at me. The meaty raccoon cracked his knuckles and bared his fangs. “Fuck off, Kevin! We don’t want your gross barn smell stuck in our fur!”<br />
<br />
“But I showered!” I protested, my ears lowering. “Mroo! I just wanted to watch!”<br />
<br />
“Just close the door, Drake.” Matt said hotly. “Who cares what that old bull wants.”<br />
<br />
Drake slammed the door shut in my face and closed the blinds.<br />
<br />
I felt ashamed and embarrassed. Was this how everyone felt about me? I showered a whole bunch, every day, and wore my anti-musk spray all the time. <br />
<br />
Then I felt a surge of anger cut through the shame. <br />
<br />
How fucking dare they? I gave them sexy new bodies and this is how I get treated? They were my fellow anthros, part of the community now. It was clear they weren’t respectful at all, they couldn’t even be civil. A country hick? Me? Sure I had an accent, but so what? And old? I was barely 21. That little shit!<br />
<br />
Now I was really fuming.Taking out my notebook, I started writing. “Drake the anthro Raccoon and Matt the anthro Otter are two country hick college students.” <br />
<br />
I considered adding more, Matt calling me old had stung, but I didn’t want to destroy their lives completely either. That wasn’t the kind of person I wanted to be. Even the two mean jocks I had ruined had a chance to fix themselves.<br />
<br />
As the text glowed, someone approached me.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Kevin, what the heck are you doing out here?” A voice spoke angrily behind me. “You were supposed to be in the private room five minutes ago!” <br />
<br />
I turned around and stared down an empty hallway before look down. Below me (and very much in my personal space) was a fat black dude in glasses with a pissed off expression on his face.  <br />
<br />
“Who are you supposed to be?” I asked, confused.<br />
<br />
“I’m Chuck.” The black said. He noticed my confusion and put his hands on his hips. “Your tutor, dumbass. Get back in the room so I can get you ready for the exams.”<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but be disappointed. <br />
<br />
Chuck looked like he’d never gotten close to a dick in his life. It also didn’t help that he barely reached my pecs. I was hoping for another cutie like Ethan, not this blob. There was no way this dude could teach me anything.<br />
<br />
 “What are you looking at?” Chuck snapped, adjusting his glasses. “Like what you see?”<br />
<br />
“No.” I said truthfully. “When Ethan told me he knew someone who was a pro, I was thinking that person would be, you know… hot.” I gestured at him. “And you probably have a much smaller dick than I normally handle. It’ll be like a hot dog down a hallway.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously?” Chuck sighed, pinching his nose in annoyance. “It’s not just size and looks that can have someone begging for more. But if you really think you can handle me, let’s make a bet.”<br />
<br />
“A bet?” I raise a brow, my tail flicking in interest. “What kind of bet?”<br />
<br />
“If I can make you respect me as your teacher, then you can’t complain about people like me.”<br />
<br />
“And if I win?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell the teacher you’re already a pro and don’t need a tutor.” Chuck held out his hand.<br />
<br />
I considered the bet for a moment. This should be way to easy for even a bottom bull like me to get this guy on his knees, begging me to suck his dick. Plus, if I can beat Chuck, then I won’t have to waste time here and spend more time with my boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Deal,” I take his thick fat hand, shaking it and watching the cellulose in his arm jiggle. I hid a smirk. This was going to be a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
“Good,” Chuck smiled and started walking back to his room, “follow me.”</p>
