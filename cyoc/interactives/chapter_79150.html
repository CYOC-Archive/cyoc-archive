<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel and Robin, a couple more cake than human, watched forlornly as the bowl of pudding was carried away to parts unknown. Soft mechanical whirrs and clicks were heard in the distance. A flash of light, and then nothing.<br />
<br />
Daniel stared into the darkness of the cooler, a place where their small fluorescent light had no power, and he grew introspective. &quot;Where do they take these people after they've finished transforming? Where are we going to end up?&quot; Daniel asked softly. Robin didn't answer. &quot;What will we even end up as? We certainly aren't humans anymore!&quot; He shook his arms in the air in impotent rage, getting upset. &quot;I have to have some answers, damn it! Don't you want to know what's going on? Who the hell is behind all of this, and how many people are in here?&quot; Still, Robin was silent.<br />
<br />
Daniel forgot her silence. A pain in his chest nearly doubled him over.<br />
<br />
Daniel had been given two whipped cream breasts early on. A side effect of the transformation was that any ejaculation or waste manifested as white whipped cream, shot out of his chest via his nipples, where it collected into piles. His whipped cream had piled up and piled up. Once in a while Daniel had wiped it off, but lost his self consciousness after the sprinkles had shown up.<br />
<br />
After his lower body had gone, his genitals had manifested as the three strawberries sticking out of him, and over the past month he had gone to Robin several times for pleasure, unable to use his hands anymore. In exchange for her services, Daniel would lick and nibble on the blueberries on her head, arms and breasts. She said it was the closest thing she could have to sex anymore.<br />
<br />
The two had become quite close. Robin had mentioned once being a boy, but Daniel had only ever seen her as female, for that is how she looked when he had met her. But he looked almost the same way now as she did then. Did all people transformed into cakes end up as women?<br />
<br />
The pain in his chest gave him his answer. The whipped cream piles hardened suddenly and became a part of his cake body. They smoothed over and rounded out, puffing up and swelling over his arms, which he had crossed over himself. He moaned with pleasure as two tiny strawberry nipples popped out, poking his arms. <br />
<br />
After a few seconds, the pain stopped. Daniel bounced a bit, and his new C-cups bounced with him. He could feel them now; he hadn't been able to before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robin... is this what happened to you? Robin? Robin, answer me!&quot; Daniel hopped to turn around and look at her directly, but recoiled when he saw the reason for her silence.<br />
<br />
Robin's blue lips had disappeared into her white face. They'd been absorbed, and her eyes were wide with fear. After all this time waiting, Robin's transformation into a vanilla blueberry cake was going to complete itself. Whatever wicked change had been started in her eight months ago was about to strip away her humanity completely.<br />
<br />
Daniel, by contrast, was becoming a vanilla strawberry cake. The changes he had undergone had been relatively quick by comparison... She had been sitting on the shelf for seven months when Daniel met her. With his new breasts, he was almost as bad as she had been yesterday. They both knew what was happening to her, and he tried to hold her hand.<br />
<br />
The cupcake at the end of his wrist wouldn't let him. Robin grabbed his pretty candy-sprinkled wrist anyway, appreciative of the comfort he was trying to provide. Blueberries began to pop out from her arms and breasts as her hair turned to white frosting and became absorbed into her head and back.<br />
<br />
Robin's right hand, still free, plunged itself into the square base of the cake her torso had been attached to. She shook her head back and forth as her left arm was forced to let go of Daniel and follow suit. Her torso sunk into the cake, up to her breasts. Frosting melted and shifted, and her head came to rest on the very top.<br />
<br />
The second spatula drew closer. Daniel craned his neck; he could see it now. It was a massive thing, and must have been 10 feet wide. It slid itself under Robin as her eyes sealed themselves shut. Robin was still, as blueberries finished covering her white frosted surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye, Robin.&quot; Daniel whispered.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he had a crazy idea. He would follow her, and figure out what was going on. He figured if he waited for a second month on this shelf, there would be no going back. The only thing that made him human at this point was his head, his torso, and his ability to speak. He suspected the structures sticking out of his cupcakes were candles. They no longer bent as fingers. He didn't want to spend the rest of his days as a cake. By next week, he knew he'd be finished.<br />
<br />
The spatula was big enough to carry two...<br />
<br />
Daniel felt the top of his head tingle. Not another change! Not now... His brown frosting hair was turning white; he could see it reflected in the steel of the shelf. It quickly smoothed itself out, leaving his scalp visible. His ears melted into the sides of his head, and the frosting smoothed over, neat as ever. His strawberry nipples puffed out a bit in response.<br />
<br />
That settled it.<br />
<br />
Daniel leaped onto it just before it moved away from the shelf. It was cramped, but the blueberry cake next to him didn't protest.<br />
<br />
Settling in for the ride, the two cakes were sped through the cooling unit, opposite the direction Daniel had come in. Daniel looked all around, trying to figure out if any other poor souls had been trapped here. He only saw about ten... things. Three were almost fully cake, like himself; all looked like women, but then, so did he. He saw a pair of boys that must have been becoming chocolate rabbits. Their legs had been brown, and rabbit shaped. Ears were growing from the tops of their heads. One was further along than the other, but they still looked mostly human. There was a large pink bowl. Daniel couldn't see inside of it... There was a pink marshmallow girl, next to a bowl. She had wings where her arms should have been. Her pink mouth pointed into  beak. Peeps. He saw a red jello mold with arms, flailing about uselessly. The last person made his heart ache; he looked completely normal, save his legs, which had been turned into a cake, like Daniel's. He had been yelling &quot;someone let me out...&quot; as Daniel sped by.<br />
<br />
This took several minutes, for the facility must have been massive. For such a large place, it was mostly empty. The spatula reached a far wall, and deposited Daniel and the Robin cake onto a platform. It began to rise...</p>
