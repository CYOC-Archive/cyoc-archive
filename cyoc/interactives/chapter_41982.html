<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa began shrinking, thinking to herself that that was odd, Kate must be a lesbian, or bisexual, seeing as how Lisa knew of Kate’s conquests over the football team. After a minute Lisa was now 5’2” tall, then she began to thin out, as her hair shrank into a bowl cut, her barely A-cup breasts shrank into nothing. Looking at herself Lisa thought she looked more like a young…. Boy instead of a girl, how strange, then the pain began shooting through her body. She felt as if her lower body was being squished on the inside, then a small cylinder began to push through along with some small sacks, she was now a 12 year old boy, with a tiny 2” penis<br />
<br />
Kate was walking through the maths corridor, thinking about Lisa, it was odd how Lisa had that name, he was a 12 year old boy after all, she reminded herself not to think of that, she still loved him, and would always love him. Sure it was a bit hard with the lovemaking but still, she enjoyed having a 12... No 13 year old lover, silly her, forgetting Lisa’s age.<br />
<br />
As Kate had been thinking Lisa had felt an odd feeling down in her… his lower regions, an itching as her… his? Testicles dropped down a few centimetres and small hairs started sprouting around her/his penis, 1, 2,3 , 10, too many to count. Her/His body shot up a few inches, as her arms and leg lengthened considerably, small hairs had begun to appear on her/his legs, blonde at the moment. She/He was now a 13 year old boy/girl/thing.<br />
<br />
Kate sat in class thinking about Lisa…. No Jake, silly her, why would Jake have such a girly name? It was strange having a boyfriend 4 years younger than her, not that it was that strange, look at the age difference between Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher for gods sake! And Jake was mature in a way, already playing football with the school and everything, at 14 he was already favourite for being the captain next year!<br />
<br />
Lisa/Jake felt a strange pressure down there again as her/his penis was being pressed on by her/his jeans more, or was it that his/her penis was pressing on the jeans? Jake/Lisa now had a 5-incher, not that he/she could see it… he was too busy  thinking about that hot bab….. NO Kate was HER best friend, she shouldn’t be doing this… Should He? Their thought process was interrupted by an eruption of hair all over their body, his legs sprouted millions of brown hairs up and down his leg, his pubic region was now almost un-see able, her  happy trail beginning to grow, and a small amount of hair was growing on his/her/their upper lip. Then her torso began to stretch, propelling him/her upwards, leaving them at 5’11”. By this point Lisa’s clothes had ripped, her sneakers were nearly at breaking point and finally snapped as the feet reached size 11s.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kate sat bored to death in English, she knew nothing about what the teacher was talking about, she didn’t care about that pile of crap Lord In The Flies, her mind wandered thinking of Jake. He was so cute, yet manly. It was nice dating the Football captain, even if they kept it secret due to him only being 15.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jake/Lisa had by this point realised there was a short break in-between these “spurts” and was able to get out of their clothes in-between spurts. She/He looked down at their body, shocked at it, Lisa had never saw a male body before, bar a few pictures in health class, and as such was surprised looking at it in the flesh, yet Jake was looking down disappointed, how the fuck was he supposed to pleasure HIS girl with that tiny penis, Lisa regained control, realising that she was slowly but surely shrinking in HER (Well it was) mind, being taken over by this new person, whoever they were, Jake something.<br />
<br />
Then the spurt started back up,<br />
<br />
Jake felt his jaw squaring up and growing slightly bigger, making him look more manly, his throat started to itch as a small lump appeared, her bowl cut going up into a gelled crew cut. Lisa felt a strange pleasure as… well her penis grew, this growing symbol of masculinity shoved Jake back into control. He just loved pleasuring Kate with his 9 incher,  not that he didn’t mind pleasuring himself either. His fairly trim body began to bulk up, a 6 pack pushing itself through his stomach, his chest &amp; Shoulders broadening madly, his pecs pushing out, strength surging through his body as his biceps, triceps and calves grew. Jake could take on the world and win now, what with his mix of intelligence and Muscle. The now 6’2” Football star felt the growth slowing down, as the small amount of Lisa left fighted to get back in</p>
