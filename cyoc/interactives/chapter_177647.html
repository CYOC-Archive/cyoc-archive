<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the hair raced up his newly furry legs, he felt his balls start to tingle and heat up. He felt them slowly throbbing, like someone was massaging them. His penis shot out to an erection. It stuck out about 5 inches, and was so hard it felt like it was going to explode. Jeff grunted at the feeling.<br />
<br />
Glancing at his balls he saw dark brown, wiry hair slowly growing out all along the sac. Within seconds, his balls were almost fully enclosed in a curly cage of pubes. The wiry dark hairs began sprouting above the base of his cock, too. If his legs were any indication (and they looked positively animalistic at this point), he was going to have a VERY hairy crotch. Suddenly his balls felt like someone was squeezing them, Jeff grunted and he looked down in amazement as his testicles actually looked like they were slowly getting bigger and bigger! The sac was getting darker, and the skin looked a bit leathery. His balls were not the size of tangerines, and they hung down quite a bit further! The hair sprouting on his balls was getting so thick he was starting to have difficulty seeing his balls. Then he noticed the skin on his penis had gotten quite a bit darker, too! He reached down and gripped his shaft. A lightning bolt of pleasure shot through him and he moaned at the sensation; his cock was so sensitive and so hard! And, he noticed, the skin on his penis felt rough and leathery. He looked and saw it was getting darker and darker, the skin toughening up. It was also rapidly swelling and getting larger. It was already a couple inches longer. As he saw precum bubbling up on the tip, Jeff&#39;s mind was racing. Was he actually growing a caveman&#39;s cock? Jeez, what was it finally going to look like?!<br />
<br />
As his cock got longer, he also felt his balls descend like an elevator down his hairy thighs. His balls were rapidly swelling in size as well. They hung loose and low, and they were very weighty and heavy. He couldn&#39;t see them through the jungle of musky pubes that had sprouted. When Jeff cupped them, he let out a startled moan; they were as big as oranges, and they were covered in thick bristly hairs. He let go and let the sac hang; &quot;Oh fuck&quot;, he moaned. His new caveman balls were so heavy. The weight of them swinging and banging his hairy things was making him so horny. <br />
<br />
His attention went back to his cock, which was around 9 or 10 inches! Not only that, but it was now very brown and the skin didn&#39;t look like the soft pink skin it was supposed to. It was leathery, and rough, and animalistic. A thick heavy foreskin had grown over the tip and a steady stream of thick precum drooled out of the up. &quot;Oh my god....&quot; Jeff muttered. This was too crazy! He didn&#39;t want to become a caveman, let alone have caveman genitals! He looked at the Chronivac and to his despair he saw that he still couldn&#39;t stop it until this current change was complete. He closed his eyes, trying to stop panicking and to take his mind off of the throbbing in his groin. Fuck, he was so horny and so hard it was almost painful.<br />
<br />
Looking down, he saw the changes spreading up his torso. His massive hairy jungle bush was now growing upwards, covering his torso in the same dark, thick curly hairs. As he rubbed his furry stomach, he noticed that the thick hair was growing out of the backs of his hands, his knuckles, and his wrist. As the hair climbed up his torso, it also climbed up his forearms, spreading upwards and upwards. Jeff&#39;s forearms looked almost like a gorilla&#39;s within several seconds. On top of this, Jeff felt a pulling sensation; his arms were growing longer and longer! His arms were hanging down almost to his knees now! Oh man, he really was turning into a caveman! He looked at his hairy hands, now huge and calloused, and he saw muscular veins racing down his hairy arm.<br />
<br />
The hair kept going until his torso was pretty much totally obscurred by hair. A quick peek in the mirror showed that his backside was not spared either! Gross! His butt was covered in hair, and as it grew up his torso, the hair likewise sprouted up his lower back. As the curls reached his chest, he grunted at the intense itching sensation. His chest within seconds was covered in a thick rug of brown hair. The hair spread up his shoulders and around to cover his back in a pelt as well. The hair on his chest was so thick you couldn&#39;t see any skin benieth it! Jeff was seriously starting to regret his decision. He had wanted to feel manly and grow some chest hair, like some of the older boys who flaunt theirs in gym class. However, he thought as he twirled the thick hairs on his chest, this was ridiculous and really gross. He didn&#39;t want to be a neanderthal!<br />
<br />
As Jeff played with his chest hair, he felt his arms start to feel heavier and heavier, his biceps heating up. He saw that his upper arms were packing on muscles and veins; he was getting ripped! The hair that had started to sprout all over his forearms was racing up his arm and he was starting to get some thick curls on his biceps and upper arms. Jeff experimentally flexed his arm, thick muscles popping. &quot;Whoa, I&#39;m getting pumped!&quot;, Jeff muttered to himself. As he was flexing, he noticed a deep itching sensation starting from under his arms. He lifted up an arm and almost gasped at what he saw; his armpits were incredibly hairy! He had grown huge bushes in his pits! Plus, Jeff was hit with a very strong musky BO stink coming from his underarms. &quot;Ugh, well if I am going to be a caveman&quot;, Jeff thought to himself, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t expect them to smell like flowers or roses I guess...&quot;. Jeff scratched one of the sweaty bushes and sniffed his finger experimentally, YUCK! He smelled like a locker room or a sweaty jockstrap. Sniffed a pit again and was finding he was starting to enjoy the smell. His new cock, still pounding erect, responded to the smell by getting even more painfully swollen and a new bead of precum drooling out from the tip. It was at this time that Jeff noticed his arms were much longer! He let his arm hang at his side and his forearms dangled almost down to his knees! He looked like a monkey! He was going to be a real knuckle dragger by the time this was over!<br />
<br />
As the hair raced up over his upper arms and coated his shoulders and his back, he felt a pulling sensation in his spine, and Jeff heard and felt a popping sensation. He groaned as his spine popped and shifted; his back was hunching and his shoulders were stooping. When the pulling sensation stopped, his hairy back was hunched over, allowing his already long, hairy arms to dangle even further to the ground. At rest, his hands hung down almost to his knees. Jeff was seriously panicking; he was being reduced to a hairy brute! The changes finally reached his neck and head. As a huge adams apple forced it&#39;s way out of his neck, Jeff grunted and groaned. The grunts became deeper and lower until they sounded so bestial, it shocked Jeff.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the pressure reached his face. Jeff grunted in a deep voice, surprised of the depth and bass of it, and a bit scared at how animalistic it sounded. Jeff felt a strong itching sensation as millions of thick, bristly, stubly hairs pushed themselves out of the skin on his cheeks, upper lips, neck, and the sides of his face. Within a few moments, he had a very thick scruffy covering of a dark beard. Jeff took a long hairy hand and scratched his new beard in amazement. &quot;I have a beard now?&quot;, Jeff tried to articulate in amazement. However, the only thing that came out were deep OOKs and grunts! Jeff tried to speak up again and soon found he had lost the ability to speak English! The only sounds and language he could produce were caveman grunts now! As he processed this new realization with horror, Jeff was almost doubled over in pain from a huge pressure above his eyes; a thick bony plate was growing and sticking out. He was getting a proper bony neanderthal brow! Feeling the bony protrusion, he could feel a thick bristly unibrow had also formed.<br />
<br />
And just like that, the changes were over. Leaving Jeff exhausted, panting, and sweating. The chronivac beeped to indicate that the changes were done. Jeff walked over to the machine, very off balance by his new proportions and his large hairy feet. He looked at the machine and was shocked; he could no longer read what was on the screen. All of the symbols looked totally alien to him! &quot;Oh god, I cant read anymore!&quot;, he thought to himself in a panic. &quot;I can&#39;t read or speak anymore!&quot;, he tried to call out but he could only produce deep grunts. Fuck, he sounded like an animal!<br />
<br />
He had to figure this out! He couldn&#39;t speak or read english, which meant that trying to change himself back with the chronivac would be nearly impossible. But what else could he do?! He looked down at his degraded body and shuttered; being stuck in such a hairy, devolved body would be a nightmare! He was absolutely covered in hair, he stunk, and he had a huge throbbing animalistic cock sticking straight out erect. Fuck he was also so horny too. He cupped his simian face into his big hairy hands and began to weep and moan in despair. What was he going to do?!?!</p>
