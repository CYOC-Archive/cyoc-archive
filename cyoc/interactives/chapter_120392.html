<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a moment the old demon had a sly look on his face, blink and you would have missed it, before it was replaced with one of pity and sympathy.  &quot;I have no way of proving what you&#39;ve said is true,&quot; the old enchanter sighed, &quot;but what I do know is that this snake is making me quite a bit of coin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Viper started to protest, pulling out and opening his wallet. &quot;Stop boy, I&#39;ve already told you, Human-made money is worthless here!&quot; the demon spat, &quot;No, no, its not your paper I want. I want you to bring me a replacement act.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Viper didn&#39;t understand.  He gave the enchanter a look of befuddlement. The demon gave out an exasperated sigh, &quot;I&#39;ll give you your snake back, if you bring me other human males whose snakes I can harvest!&quot;  Viper&#39;s eye&#39;s widened, his mouth dropped open in shock.  He could never put another boy in this situation, robbed of his manhood so it could be a demons plaything. Viper was about to protest but the old enchanter had begun playing again. Viper&#39;s cock had popped back up and was now quickly making its way to Viper.  It had jumped up and slid back into his pants, wiggling down to its rightful place.  Viper&#39;s protests were silenced. While it was attached, it just felt better there, he knew he&#39;d do anything to get his little buddy back.  <br />
<br />
Viper nodded his head and let out an almost inaudible, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;  The enchanter clapped, &quot;Excellent boy! You wont regret this&quot; placing one hand on Viper&#39;s shoulder and using the other to take back Viper&#39;s still lose cock. &quot;Return here after sunset with some replacement snakes, and you may have yours back&quot; the demon stated leading Viper back to regular Hell&#39;s nest.  Matt went home and tried his best to come up with a plan.<br />
<br />
That Monday at school passed slower than ever.  Every second seemed to take a minute to go by.  It didn&#39;t help that Viper could still feel his penis. He could feel it dance, he could feel when it was stroked, when it was pricked, when it pissed.  Some cruel demon must have given it a good thwack right as Viper was walking down the hallway. He dropped to his knees with tears in his eyes, holding the spot where his proud manhood had once been.  Viper&#39;s plan was simple if not a little misguided.  He texted 3 of the guys he normally could count on to skate in his video&#39;s and asked them to join him for another session.  Viper would lure them into the flipside and let the demon&#39;s due the rest.  The afternoon and then the evening finally came.  The video was not Viper&#39;s best. He was completely distracted and struggling with what he&#39;d agreed to do. He didn&#39;t have a choice though, he wanted his meat back where it belonged.  <br />
<br />
Chris, Mike, and Dwane were basically friends of Matt&#39;s.  They couldn&#39;t skate as good as he could and they were more interested in girls than practicing but they were nice guys.  &quot;Hey lets see if there are cool spots down over here&quot; Viper said nervously gesturing to flipside Hell&#39;s Nest. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know dude&quot; Chris said &quot;That place gives me the creeps. Dwane agreed.  &quot;Come on&quot; Mike said reassuringly to the group &quot;it&#39;ll be great.&quot; Once Viper was out of earshot, Mike turned to the group of boys, &quot;Did you see how badly Matt sucked today?&quot; They all nodded in agreement. &quot;Lets go along with him on this, he must really need it&quot; Mike continued.  So the four boys headed into flipside.  Viper wrestled with what he was doing as he lead the boys towards the ruined skatepark and hopefully his reunion with his pecker.  <br />
<br />
When they finally got to the skatepark, it was deserted. Viper looked around nervously, where was he? They had a deal.  &quot;Whoa dude, this place looks wrecked&quot; Dwane sputtered, &quot;I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s much we can skate on here.&quot;  Viper saw a little movement over on the far side, &quot;What about over there&quot; he said too excitedly pointing at where the movement was.  The four boys headed over towards a section of quarter pipe that looked more less intact.  <br />
<br />
When the boys made it over to the quarter pipe the trap was sprung.  One of the two larger demons grabbed Dwane and the smaller lesser demons grabbed Mike and Chris.  The three boys struggled in vain as the enchanter slowly made his way out from around the pipe, Viper&#39;s massive dick walking next to him.  &quot;Good, good&quot; the enchanter said as he looked over the boys, &quot;very athletic, lots of muscle, very handsome, they&#39;re sure to have nice snakes for my show. You did well boy&quot; It was at this point the other three noticed Viper was not being held against his will.  &quot;What the fuck dude,&quot; Dwane screamed, &quot;and what the fuck is that?&quot; gesturing to Viper&#39;s detached penis. &quot;My penis&quot; viper said sheepishly, &quot;they took it and now they&#39;re going to take yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three boys were shocked and continued to struggle.  The bigger of the two original demons, the very same one who had taken Viper&#39;s dick from him. Moved over towards the three captives.  He used his large claws to make small cuts in the waste bands of each of the boys pants and underwear before unceremoniously ripping all of them off leaving the guys naked from the waste down.  Viper had never looked at other men&#39;s appendage before, most of the time they were avoiding his.  So he was suprised to see how small his friends were.  Dwane was the biggest and he was still only half as big as Viper soft.  Chris&#39;s was so small it almost looked like it was sucking itself in, it looked even sillier with such a huge set of balls beneath it.  Mike was somewhere in between the other two.  <br />
<br />
The three boys spat curses at Viper and the demons as the demons mercilessly mocked them back. Say goodbye to your snakes boys the free demon said viciously as he placed one finger in Dwane&#39;s ass, kissed him deeply and used his freehand to snatch Dwane&#39;s member away.  The display continued down the line finally getting to a crying and begging Mike.  The four penises now roamed freely together on the ground in front of their former masters as the enchanter played is demonic tune.</p>
