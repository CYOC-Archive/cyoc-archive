<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The others stared in awe as Billy’s face re-acquired more human semblance and he continued shrinking to a more normal human size.<br />
<br />
But then they realised that things were not completely right as his blond hair started darkening to a chestnut brown. As Billy’s vision improved he looked at the other guys’ faces and saw a look of dismay on all of them. Meanwhile a pelt of brown body hair started spreading across his body.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Billy asked whilst clearing his throat as his voice changed. His voice was definitely not his so far, but it still sounded somewhat familiar.<br />
<br />
“I think you’d better sit down for this” said Max, immediately recognising the voice and the familiar hair colour and body hair.<br />
<br />
“Why?” retorted Billy, now panicked, as he ran towards the full length mirror, floorboards creaking under his still considerable mass. The others joined him. He noticed he had stopped losing height but he was actually somewhat shorter than the Billy clone standing next to him in the mirror’s reflection. He also was barely losing any mass despite the fact he was still sizable.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re changing into me…” came Max’s reply<br />
<br />
“But how can this have happened?!”<br />
<br />
“Remember you’re still wearing the clothes I lent you to leave the house. And you were wearing them when you touched the medallion…”<br />
<br />
“Shit…” whispered Billy in a defeated tone. <br />
<br />
Panicked and speechless, his mouth dry, Billy struggled to tear off the T-shirt and shorts that were now starting to fit him much better, no longer leaving his midsection exposed. Left only in a loose pair of Max’s boxers he assessed the damage in the mirror.<br />
<br />
All he could think about was how the old Max used to look and what he used to think about him. He had always thought of Max as the fat, hairy dude with a receding hairline from apartment 6. And soon that would be his fate.<br />
<br />
Billy’s mass continued shifting despite the fact he had stopped condensing in on himself. Muscles started appearing on his previously unnaturally large, yet skinny body. His chest jutted out as his pecs grew and his arms and shoulders started showing decent definition and size. His calf and thighs also burst into muscle growth as his thighs started rubbing against each other. He winced in pain as his back started spreading wide giving him a manly V-shape.<br />
<br />
“This may not be too bad” thought Billy as he looked at his reflection. His facial features contorting into those reminiscent of the old Max. His jaw squared off as his brow retained somewhat its previous Cyclopean prominence. His eyebrows became heavier as brown stubble spread across his face. His eyes turned a dull shade of hazel. Billy didn’t look half bad, the others were thinking observing the new Billy.<br />
<br />
“What the hell Billy! You look like I did when I was in college!” <br />
<br />
“So you weren’t always fat?” Billy asked Max.<br />
<br />
“No. I was actually quite fit at the start of college but let’s just say that a knee injury the freshman fifteen hit me quite hard-”<br />
<br />
No sooner had he finished saying that, than Billy bent forward in pain grabbing his midsection. <br />
<br />
“Ahhhh” he cried as he could feel his gut expand through his fingers. His belly started protruding out just as his newly acquired muscles started being padded by husky mass. His chest expanded out further, this time losing its firmness and sagging somewhat, overflowing from the side. His nipples grew in size as his areolae swelled to the size of salami slices. His back grew out further still, this time with generous helpings of blubber and love-handles, making him lose somewhat his momentary V-shape. His butt jutted out as his ass-cheeks swelled with flab. His beefy limbs softened and lost their definition under a coating of flab. His cheeks puffed up as his face lost its angular features under his new mass. All the while his belly continued expanding until it jutted considerably in front of him. Max’s previously loose boxers were now fitting him like a glove.<br />
<br />
He then realised his hairline was receding at the temples just as a few stray grey hair also appeared. An inkling of crow’s-feet settled around his eyes, reflecting his new age of 36. Meanwhile his pelt of body hair thickened considerably, being particularly thick on his chest and along his gut down into his boxers. <br />
<br />
“I think it’s over…” said Billy in a tone of resignation. He stared at his reflection. Staring back at him was a hefty man, about 5’10” and 250 pounds, in the throes of early middle-age. Middle age spread had hit him hard. He was beefy and well-built but his physique was hidden under considerable bulk, especially in his gut and chest both of which sagged under their own weight but retained a hint of firmness.  He had thick stubble and was hairy all over, except where it actually counted, since his scalp hair was thinning at the temples and crown.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you’re fucking heavy man!” exclaimed Tony, not empathising with Billy’s new predicament. “You mean we can change back now that the freak-show is ready?” Tony added eyeing the medallion and John in his old physique.<br />
<br />
“OMG! I always wanted to gain some mass and fill my frame but this is not what I had in mind!” said Billy ignoring Tony’s comments. He patted his now considerable gut as he leaned forward trying to see the lower half of his body that was obscured by his gut. His whole body jiggled with the pat. He finally managed to see his wide stout size 14 feet, which were somewhat smaller but much hairier than the size 16 flippers he was accustomed. <br />
<br />
Billy finally let go of the medallion and placed it on the table, having resigned to the fact that he will be unable to change back to his own body before another 12 hours.</p>
