<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Big John had his moments when from being as a horse and stallion the wafting breeze might blow him the scent of some mare in need. This would instill upon him a short time of self pleasure and from this he spewed the floor of his stall with a deeper and heady scent.<br />
<br />
It was at these times he would paw a fore hoof in a corner of his stall. There and under his grain feed bin sat tucked under old straw, a Medallion, &quot;The Medallion,&quot; the thing that brought him to understand just how beastly a man can get!<br />
<br />
He knew it was there but without having his complete human abilities, unable to speak but in equine ways, the way to return him to what he was, to being a man, this was gone. Yet from those panic times of self centered lust and passion he remembered the power this thing could wheel. His desire was to protect his daughter from a bestial fate such as what he became; so he hid the Medallion from all who might be as or more foolish than he.<br />
<br />
It happened on an afternoon when Misses Morrison saddled Big John and rode him out along the park lands; Jennifer diligently went about her chores. Cleaning the stable stalls was no delight to her, but a necessary evil that she and her mother took turns doing.<br />
<br />
Dust and whatever that she stirred from out the stalls made her eyes water, tearing, she felt that same old dig, she missed her father, wanting to tell him of her great love for Jarred, wishing he too could join in and be a happy part of her coming wedding.<br />
<br />
Doing her utmost to do thing right and complete, Jennifer worked her rake about each stall, digging and loosening the muck and straw. She worked hard at the stall of Big John, removing most every bit of straw from off the floor, but found more manure caked and hardened to the floor. <br />
<br />
She took a pressure hose and sprayed hot water to loosen and clean the floor to its cleanest state, only to hear the tinkling sound of a coin rolling and bouncing about from the hard spraying of water.<br />
<br />
The silver medallion coin lay on the stall floor, a pretty bobble, one which no self respecting woman could resist picking up, and keeping.<br />
<br />
Again the hard working young woman returned to her duties, and with the work and sweat she finally took time to rest and relax.<br />
<br />
Relaxing she took out her newest find, rolling it over and over in her hands she began to wonder and work her vivid female imagination.<br />
<br />
Her great longing welled up again, and in as much she made a wish, wishing she could understand, wanting to know and see why her dear father left his wife and daughter to fend for themselves.<br />
<br />
A wish made instilled the medallion to bring forth the answer to many questions. <br />
<br />
Jennifer felt so tired, her eyes grew tired too, eyelids getting heavy, she dozed off as she sat in a corral and under a broad branched Maple tree.<br />
<br />
In her mind the Medallion brought about a dream, and she saw and heard her father on his last day as a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pony is Jarred, and this magic medallion changed him to an animal!&quot; said Mr. Morrison slowly.<br />
<br />
The Misses looked at the pony and then at her husband. &quot;I don't believe it your both crazy!&quot; Even as she said it the words seemed outside any possible reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prove it to me, I think this is crazy, if this is what happened then what happened to Jenn?&quot; she asked stumbling over her words.<br />
<br />
The Medallion held in Mr. Morrison's fingers was suddenly grabbed away by his dear wife. &quot;Your crazy, you need to be locked up! Things like this don't happen and I'll prove it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding the Medallion in her finger tips and with a wild spited look on her face she hollered, &quot; If this thing has such power than.....&quot; As she looked about the barn, &quot;then this should make me believe by making me a prize American Shetland pony too since you prize that beast so very much!&quot;<br />
<br />
A toss of the Medallion to her husband and she started to stomp out of the stable in a rage. Just as the Medallion touched Mr. Morrison's hand he looked at it's bright glow. The medallion began it's spinning of a curse which the Misses would never forget. A scream from the backyard made Mister run out the stable.<br />
<br />
Moans and screams of his terrorized wife came from inside the fenced patio and yard. As Mr. Morrison opened the gate he almost knew what he'd find. In fact he stood looking at his quickly changing wife.<br />
<br />
She had exploded in size. Her jeans had torn as the hindquarters of a pony mare bloomed in size. Shoe strings split as feet lengthened and a hoof replace human toes. Pony hair rapidly was covering her legs and lower body. The Misses eyes were wide in fright and with a half changed hand she beckoned her husband to stop this all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how to stop you wish until the Medallion is done!&quot; said Mr. Morrison.<br />
<br />
As she lay to her side and moaned with odd soundings her husband stood feeling his maleness rise to this occasion. The middle-aged wife he'd loved for twenty years was rapidly gaining youth and a fine form for a pony mare. The Medallion was doing it's best to make a champion American Shetland pony mare out of his wife.<br />
<br />
As the Medallion cooled down the mare struggled to stand on all fours. A horrified wife approached her human husband and with both human and equine thoughts getting mixed she snuffed at the lump in his jeans.<br />
<br />
The gesture was almost too much for the man. As he grabbed the tops to his jeans he was ready to pounce aboard the mare, his wife. Lucky for him his tight leather belt stopped the move and made him thing of his actions. &quot;No dear if you really want to feel the passion of a mare then Jarred is your man, ah horse, ah stud, oh come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mare followed her husband to the stable. As the scent of mare touched the breeze Jarred 's head lifted high and with curled upper lips drank in the scent of mare.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison being a long time breeder of stock saw the then erect stallion doing his best to sniff of mare. Then turning to see his wife being out of rational human controlled thought as she stood with tail high and legs spread.<br />
<br />
Anger flared in Morrison at the sight of animal passion's being shown by his wife. As he scowled at her no thought of the woman he'd married ran in his mind only thoughts of despised feelings. The feelings of being betrayed in love by his wife made him mad. If he'd stood long enough to think about all that had transpired he might not have done what he did.<br />
<br />
A unlatching of the box stall door he shooed the mare to a waiting stallion. Then as she trotted inside he closed the door, latched the latch, and walked to the stable door. &quot;Enjoy it dear!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the wild animal noises came from one accustomed to his stallion's passion the whinnies of a mare's fears mixed.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison popped a beer can open and sitting on the rear deck of the home heard the whinnies from the stable.  <br />
<br />
Jarred was fast forgetting his heritage and quickly finding the passion for his new life. The stallion laid over the humped mare, his shaft so deep into her sex that his sheath had parted the vulva.<br />
<br />
Misses Morrison stood with the stallion over her hairy back, a mare's head hung low in submission. The wild and odd feelings of being humped as the animal she was, in her mind she felt disturbed. Her love for a husband was now being washed away in favor of this wonderful new style of making love.<br />
<br />
Moaning and often letting a high pitched whinny from her rubbery lips, the Misses enjoyed Jarred's shaft.<br />
<br />
Jarred huffed and snorted in delight of this new and tight fitted conquest. Unlike most stallions who mount, thrust several times, spurt out their semen and then dismount. Jarred was different, he wanted to mount mares! Mount and stay on top to get all the feel he possibly could, and rational memory from being a person no doubt.<br />
<br />
An hour had passed and after three more beers Mister Morrison was getting upset. The beer increased his male gusto and with rubber legs he tripped down the steps from the deck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Insulted, I'm insulted, she never enjoyed me like she's been fun'in with Jarred! he mumbled as he walked closer to the stable. A sound of a cork popping from a bottle came from the stable as a mare whinnied in delight.<br />
<br />
Rounding a corner of the barn's open door he saw Jarred licking the trails of juices from his wife's horsey butt. The animal face of his wife turned to see him and with a whinny of her gratitude she gave a ponies' smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never gave me sex like that woman!&quot; babbled Mister Morrison.<br />
<br />
Walking into the big box stall the incensed man dropped his jeans and flopped out a pretty pink penis. &quot;What's he got that I don't! he yelled.<br />
<br />
The response from Jarred was a true horsey laugh as he snorted at the weak and short manly tool. Prancing about the stall Jarred waved his long black cock for all to see. The pride in his mounting and the delight in his length made the pony prance with joy.<br />
<br />
Standing in the stall and looking down at his less than stallion's sized penis mister Morrison began to mumble. &quot; Damn it dear I only wanted.... You made the wish to be as.... You and Jarred had such... OH dear that crazy Medallion changed our daughter to a Palomino mare for a day! But, but I changed her back to the girl and she's in her little bed upstairs. I, I, I, ah wanted to give you only the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
A scrabbling hand digs out the Medallion from his watch pocket. &quot;This damn thing is the cause of all our troubles. It changed Jennifer's friend Jarred into that stud of a pony. It changed Jennifer somehow to a Palomino mare, and you to this perfect brood mare. I could win some good ribbons at show with you and Jarred! Hey think of the price I'd get for a pure bred American Shetland stallion at stud! Hey let alone the price for one of your foals with him as the sire, wow!&quot; said Morrison.<br />
<br />
A flick across his face of a coarse haired tail of his mare wife brought him somewhat back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey damn it you stupid mare! If I could have a black cock like Jarred's I'd be able to give you one hell of a good screwing.&quot; mister Morrison spouted.<br />
<br />
The Medallion in his hand glowed red hot and with the sudden heat he dropped it into the straw covered floor. A moan from his mouth and he bent over till his forehead touched the mare's withers.<br />
<br />
Eyes closed tight as the pain surged in his groin. Another moan and as the pain subsided he stood up. Still holding one hand on his wife's withers to steady shaky legs he stood up slowly.<br />
<br />
The whinnied from Jarred was followed by one from his mare' wife. A look about soon brought into sight his very erect, super black, extra lengthened stallion shaped cock. The monster organ waved about in the air as it stood erect and positioned to mount a mare.<br />
<br />
At first a moral Christian fear came over the man but as he touched the member his passion welled up. Breathing heavy and almost snorting he approached his mare' wife's rump. The look back to her changed husband did not give her the instinctive desire to let him mount. A tail tightened down over her holes as legs were also held tight together. Mister Morrison looked at the mare and from his experience with horses understood.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me and look I've been given enough for your new body! Hey I can mount you and still touch you as the husband could, or do you just want to be humped?&quot; Morrison said with anger in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn It!&quot; he yelled and then gave a hard kick to the mares flanks.<br />
<br />
Jarred was not so far gone into animal mental state that he did not feel anger toward this action. In a sudden move he charged mister Morrison knocking his face down in the shit strewn, straw covered floor.<br />
<br />
Morrison laid there the wind knocked out of him till his hand touched the Medallion. A fit of anger and embarrassed he sat up. A patooie as he spit out a small road apple that had enter his open mount from the fall. Holding the Medallion up into Jarred's face he hollered, &quot; I wish that you were that foolish boy again! I wish my wife to be her womanly self to be the mother of my daughter! I wish, I wish!&quot; he stopped and sitting in the straw looked down at the stallion's cock he owned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish this all never happened, that Jarred, Jennifer, and Mother would not remember this whole stupid affair. I wish that I didn't ever know of the power this Medallion owns! I wish... I'd wished... I'd wanted...always to be like one of my horses. I wished for years to be just as that pure bred pony stallion there that Jarred was lucky to become! I wish that as he is a boy I would be become the great stallion and no one out there would remember me as a man. My embarrassed past would be a secret and .... oh Hell !&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Jennifer awoke from her dream as a friendly pony wandered close and gave her owner a wet lip nibble.<br />
<br />
Jumping up and standing, Jennifer leaned against the old maple tree, she remembered her dream, it was as real as if it actually happened. Yet from it she had more questions, some she needed to place before Big John.</p>
