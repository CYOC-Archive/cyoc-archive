<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Mark was on the bathroom, Kevin was practically alone in the room. Raul and Jimmy were deeply sleeping so he was free to do anything. First, he can&#39;t  bear any more time that bad foot smell so he opened a window to let some fresh air to come in. He made a deep breath in relief, he thought it was weird but exciting at the same time to feel the wind going through his new beard.<br />
After that, he returned to the table where it was the bottle with pills that had made him curious. He hadn&#39;t before, but he was a little jealous of Raul&#39;s endowment. Having a beard and being tall was great, but what he desired more was to be hung like that. He had said something about it before, but he made sure that everybody thinks he was joking so he was able to hear any advice from anyone who knows more about it. Also, he had believed in magic and science fiction that could make possible his fantasies. These pills could be his way to complete them and this could be his only opportunity to take them.<br />
He took the bottle with a hand and slowly opened the top. The pills looked like the regular ones he had taken before when he has been sick, so he thought that they couldn&#39;t so bad as Mark had implied. He wanted to take the perfect dose, neither too much to become a freak nor just one to do nothing. He decide that the best choice was to take two, maybe that was the dose Raul and Jimmy had taken.<br />
He swallowed one and he stopped in order to see if he has changed something, but he didn&#39;t see any difference, his already thick bear, his big feet and his height were the only things he can notice, so he decided to continue. In that moment, Mark was getting in the room.<br />
&quot;Ugh. You don&#39;t have any idea of how frustrating is to pee with no control.&quot; Mark said while he was cleaning his hands with a napkin. &quot;It&#39;s like having a leak hose between my legs.&quot; In that moment, he saw Kevin with a pill near to his open mouth. &quot;Stop it! Don&#39;t swallow it!&quot;<br />
Despite his screams Kevin ended swallowing the second pill, he was anxious of seeing a change on him, specially on his dick but it doesn&#39;t look like any had changed.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. These pills didn&#39;t work. I had swallowed two and nothing has changed on me.&quot; Kevin said.<br />
&quot;Have you swallowed two?&quot; Mark said. &quot;What were you thinking?&quot;<br />
Kevin didn&#39;t say nothing, he was to dissapointed of the pills that he didn&#39;t care about it any more. Instead, he get close to the bed where Raul and Jimmy were sleeping, it was completely covered in viscous fluids but he didn&#39;t care. Mark thought that it was useless to argue with him, so he walked to his friends. When he was next to Kevin he attempted to say him that everything will be fine, but Kevin yelled before.<br />
&quot;I feel something!&quot; Kevin said excited. &quot;I... I...&quot; Mark was astounded listening to his friend. &quot;I feel sleepy...&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!!&quot; Mark shouted to Kevin, but the boy fell asleep over the bed, above Jimmy and Raul. &quot;Hey, Kevin! What happens with you?!!&quot; Mark tried to wake up his friend but Kevin didn&#39;t react, so Mark let him to sleep on the bed.<br />
He was thinking about what to do, when he saw something unusual on Kevin&#39;s butt. It was like a small thing attached to him. He get close to look it and he realized that it was some kind of dart, like the ones hunters use to catch wild animals. He wondered what does that means but then he felt a jab on his right shoulder. He started to feel dizzy quickly and before he fell asleep he saw the same dart on him.<br />
A few seconds after Mark fell asleep, a team of five men dressed in black entered the room. Each one took a boy and the last one used a vacuum-like device to quickly clean the mess in the room. He took the bottle with pills and left a card in its place. When the other men have the boys over their backs they jumped over the window one by one. First, who was carrying Kevin, then Mark, Jimmy and finally, Raul. But before the man could jump, Lucile opened the door with a diaper on her hands. When she saw that someone was kidnapping her son he left the diaper and ran to the kidnapper, but the other man who was there stopped her and then used an odd gas to sleep her. Lucile struggled for some seconds, but she was losing her conscience so fast the last thing she saw before falling asleep was her son dissapearing from the window.<br />
As Lucile fell asleep on the cleaned bed, the last man on the room jumped through the window and dissapeared.</p>
