<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still sitting in the Talbot kitchen and absently thinking while sipping his now cold Coffee; Nate could not help but smile as he saw Jean come home from her classes at Moon Lake College. She was surprised to see him there as the two were planning to meet up later; giving her werewolf lover a kiss as he smiles and returns it, Nate had a moment of clarity.<br />
‘I Need to put a ring on that were-lioness now,” Nate looking as his girlfriend walk to her room.<br />
<br />
“Regina,” Nate speaking up; “do you have any onion rings?”<br />
“Onion rings,” Regina looking at Nate questioningly; “why do you ask that? Besides we are having Chicken Ala King for supper.”<br />
“I can’t wait to get a proper engagement ring,” Nate answering; “I want to propose to Jean right now. I figured an onion ring would be,” Nate looking at the elder were-lioness; “just as romantic.”<br />
<br />
Regina looks at the young man growing his funky beard with a measure of suspicion before smiling.<br />
“I have something better then what you are planning,” Regina putting down the knife and washing her hands; “give me a few moments.” Nate watches as Regina leaves the kitchen and comes back a minute later holding a small red box containing a simple gold ring with a single amber stone.<br />
“This ring has been in the Talbot family for generations,” Regina handing the box to Nate; “Leon and I were planning on giving this to Peter when he found his mate. But,” looking at Nate; “it’s clear you and Jean will benefit from this better.”<br />
“I don’t know what to say,” Nate looking at the ring and then Regina; “I’m not sure I can accept this.”<br />
“Don’t worry about it,” Regina smiling; “Leon will understand and be thrilled that the ring will be used to bring his daughter together with her lover. Go,” Regina placing a loving hand on Nate’s shoulder; “pop the question with Jean.”<br />
<br />
Nate looking at Regina as she nods to him; the werewolf gets up and heads to Jean’s room just as Leon comes back to the kitchen covered in the usual grease from tinkering with cars.<br />
“What’s up with Nate,” Leon looking at the werewolf clearly on cloud nine.<br />
“Brace yourself your highness,” Regina using Leon’s formal title as the were-lion king; “the next time Nate leaves Jean’s room, you’ll be greeting your son inlaw. I gave him the ring,” Regina looking at her husband; “the same one you gave to me,” Regina looking at her mate lovingly; “when we had our were-wedding.”<br />
<br />
Leon’s eyes go wide as Regina smiles; placing hands on her husband’s shoulder. Smiling, as both hear a mighty roar of a yes coming from Jean from her room; shortly after the sounds of rutting could be heard.<br />
“Call your brothers,” Regina kissing a surprised Leon before going back to making dinner; “you got a wedding to officiate at the next Pride gathering.”<br />
“From the sounds of things,” Leon still looking surprised; “our daughter and Nate don’t need one.”<br />
“Well,” Regina looking at her husband; “we do need to make it official in the eyes of state law. You are still an ordained justice of the peace. Plus I want to meet Nate’s parents.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
As Regina and Leon were having their chat; Nate walks into Jean’s room to see her looking at some books. Knowing she is studying to become a lawyer; Nate didn’t want to interrupt her school work but felt he had to.<br />
“Jean,” Nate taking his clothes off and assuming his werewolf fursona; his lupine member in full display from both arousal and eagerness. “I need to ask you something.”<br />
Jean seeing her boyfriend and his ruby red rocket staring at her; giggles, “I need to finish reading this chapter on tort law. We can have fun later.”<br />
“This can’t wait,” Nate approaching and getting on bended knee as best he can with his digitigrade stance; “we have knowing each other for some time and have had some great times. But now,” Nate smiling as he slowly reveals the red box clutched in his paw; “I want to take it to the next level. Jean Talbot,” Nate opening the box to reveal the ring Regina just gave him; “be my mate. Now and forever.”<br />
<br />
Jean seeing the ring and recognizing it as the one her father gave to her mother. It chocked her up to see Nate presenting the exact same ring to her. Knowing the story behind the ring and that fact that it was shortly after Leon putting the ring on Regina’s finger; Peter, Jean’s older brother was soon conceived afterwards. Feeling a large up swell of emotion; Jean is unable to hold back the lion within her as she shifts into were-lioness fursona. Growling as Nate gently places the ringer on the ring finger of her right paw; a single tear escaping her eye as she looks at her werewolf popping the question with the usual nervousness. Glancing at the ring as Nate nervously waits for her answer; Jean makes a mighty roar that sounded like a yes as she pounces Nate and makes it clear how thrilled she is.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Peter Talbot, the eldest of Leon’s cubs and future lion-king in waiting was studying for his courses in business when he hears his sister roar loudly and a large thud could be heard from the wall separating their rooms.<br />
“Oh god,” Peter shaking his head; unaware that his sister just accepted Nate’s proposal. He gets up to leave his room; Peter sees his parents in the kitchen both sporting wide dopey grins as they listen to the loud and wild love making going on in Jean&#39;s room.<br />
“How can you two listen to that,” Peter looking stunned at his parents.<br />
“Because,” Leon looking at his son; “your sister just reacted the same way your mother did, when I proposed to her.”<br />
“Don’t be surprise,” Regina smiling; “that Nate and Jean will rut all the way to sunrise tomorrow.”<br />
“Fuck,” Peter looking stunned; “I know Nate was talking about getting an engagement ring earlier when he asked me to look over his books, but how did he get one so soon?”<br />
“I gave him the one you father gave to me,” Regina smiling; “now your father has to plan a wedding ceremony soon. Nate and Jean are currently in the throes of their were-wedding.”<br />
“Well I’m going to see if Liv is home,” Peter shaking his head; “if I’m not going to be able to study,  I’m going to shoot for some heavy rutting with a were-leopard.”<br />
“Will I be planning two weddings then,” Leon grinning; all the while everyone hears Jean out roaring Nate’s howling.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
In Jean’s room; Nate was surprised as Jean leaped on him. Her tattered clothes as they did not survive her shifting being ripped off as she desperately drives her hungry snatch onto Nate’s ruby red rod. Driving down with such force as she envelopes the knot in one thrust; Nate struggling and wrestling with Jean. Both wanting to be on top as the two lovers growl and scratch each other in the throes of passion.<br />
<br />
Rolling around on the floor; each thrusting their hips as their pleasure builds, Nate eventually wins the struggle and stares at his were-lioness as she growls. Wrapping her legs around him; his tail swishing proudly as he wins the wrestling match and the were-lioness heart. Pounding and thrusting with wild abandoned; it not long before both erupt and announce their climaxes with a mighty roar and howl in perfect unison.</p>
