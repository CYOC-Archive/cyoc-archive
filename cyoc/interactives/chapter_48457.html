<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sleep slowly receded from Bobby and blinking, she looked across the way toward her sleeping sister. As she lay in bed, taking in the sleeping form underneath her sheets and comforter, Bobby tried to clear her thoughts. But, for some reason she could not remember properly who she was, just that at one point she was someone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is,&quot; she thought and then shaking her head, she tried again by thinking, &quot;My name is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aimee,&quot; she said aloud.<br />
<br />
Rolling over so that she was lying flat upon her stomach, she slid out of bed. She knew that she was not Aimee, but it was the only name that came to mind as she tried to remember who she was. Looking back over at her sister, she smiled as she became aware that her sister also was suffering from some sort of transformation as well.<br />
<br />
Realising that she hadn't wet the bed, Aimee smiled and took off out of the room. As she passed the mirror she and her sister sometimes played in front of, she had a fleeting glimpse of a girl...who also looked a bit like a boy...of about nine years of age with long, brown hair that fell gently halfway down her back. She saw this, but took no notice of it, her mind...which was slowly regressing back to that of four years old...was on the thoughts of breakfast.<br />
<br />
As she exited, Abby shifted in her bed and had a fleeting glimpse of her sister exiting the room. Laying in her bed, she thought back to the previous evening and how she and Stacy...a girl that her mother and aunt did not believe exist...had found a book in her aunt's room and how she had read something from the book and how a small explosion had thrown her off her feet and how Stacy had disappeared.<br />
<br />
Yawning, she rolled over on her belly, slid out of her bed, and slowly made her way across the room...only to pause when she came to the full body mirror. Peering into the reflective surface, she wanted suddenly to scream aloud.<br />
<br />
Instead, Abby choose to remain silent and take in her reflection. Reflected back, she saw clearly that her face, neck, hands and feet where now purple in colour. Scared at what she might find, Abby undid the buttons on the front of her pyjamas and peered downward at the purple torso and after a bit of shifting about, her now purple legs.<br />
<br />
Wondering to herself, &quot;What the hey,&quot; Abby buttoned up her pyjamas and exited her and Aimee's room. Moving through the apartment, she voices soon greeted her young ears and following them, she found her mother and sister sitting at the table eating breakfast.<br />
<br />
Sitting down, her mother placed a bowl of cereal before her and as she began to eat, she asked, &quot;Where's Aunt Andi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gone home,&quot; her mother replied, as she turned back to what she had been doing before Abby had come in, leaving Abby to eat and discreetly study Bobby across the table.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, Abby returned to her room, passing Bobby on the way and noting that her sister looked more and more like a girl. Inside her room, Abby undressed and standing nude before the mirror, her mind flip-flopping back and forth between one idea and another, she took in her reflection.<br />
<br />
From head to toe, her skin was a medium purple colour and Abby wasn't sure how she knew, but she knew that this was because of soft, but tiny scales that covered her. Thinking about these scales, Abby suddenly realised that they didn't truly cover her body completely, because everything from underneath her chin down to the area between her leg was slowly turning a multi-shaded colour, much like the a kaleidoscope toy she had at one time.<br />
<br />
Wondering what she had gotten herself into, she sighed and turning away from the mirror, she went to her dresser and began getting dressed. As she first pulled on a pair of pink underwear and then a white shirt, she thought it all felt somewhat tight. And then when she pulled on her favourite pair of bib-overalls that were baby blue in colour, it was then that she really noticed that her clothes were tight...especially in the upper arm, upper leg and crotch area. Wondering to herself, she exited her room and walked across the hallway and into the guest room, unsure of what she was looking for.<br />
<br />
Inside, she looked about the now empty room, wondering if the book actually did belong to her aunt. Searching about, Abby soon became disappointed when it became evident that she would not be able to locate the book. As she was leaving, she happened to glance at the nightstand. And upon the stand, she saw a note. Curious, she walked over and picked up the note.<br />
<br />
The moment she touched it, Abby received an static electric shock and the words written on it made sense. Reading carefully, Abby read:<br />
<br />
~Abby~<br />
<br />
   You, and you alone, will be able to find this note. And only you will be able to read it...so it doesn't pay to show it to anybody.<br />
   By now, you should be aware that you are undergoing a transformation of your own. This I have arranged because of what you have done to your brother. And it is because of what you have done, that you shall pay a price for.<br />
   Do not fear, you shall still be a girl, like you want. However, your species will be an entirely different matter.<br />
   What species will you be, you ask...Well let’s just leave it at that you will be Therionthropic...or if you prefer, Anthropomorphic. And don't worry about asking people for help, they will be unable to see that you are transforming and think your appearance is normal.<br />
   So, sit back, enjoy, and in the future, try not to use magick as a form of punishment...unless you have all the full facts.<br />
<br />
                         ~Aunt Andi~<br />
    PS I am sorry about what happened to Stacy, but I suppose it is all part of the spell and something you must learn to live, and deal, with.<br />
<br />
Staring at the note, Abby slowly reread it and then dropping it on the floor, she backed away from it, as if it was something contagious. As she did so, a strange feeling began to spread over her, originating just above her tailbone and slowly spreading until it stopped right in the middle of her butt.<br />
<br />
As the feeling grew, Abby sank to her knees. Bending forward, so that she was now on her hands and knees, the feeling in her tailbone grew and grew, until with a loud rip of tearing fabric, a long tail exploded outward. <br />
<br />
Twisting one way and then another, Abby eventually craned her head and was able to take in the purple tail that was now exiting her pants. As she stared at the new appendage, she wondered to herself if maybe she shouldn't find the note and tear it up, there by getting her out of the situation she suddenly found herself in.</p>
