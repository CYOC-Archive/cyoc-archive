<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the end of Rhonda&#39;s lunch period came a class that she&#39;d been looking forward to for some time, even more so given her current state. Ever since she&#39;d seen PE on the list of classes, she&#39;d been devilishly curious about what that would even cover - the witches she had met, Sofia included, had shown a preference for magically zapping away fat and zapping in some muscle rather than building it up the old-fashioned way. That this class took place in St. Chariot&#39;s gymnasium seemed to indicate that they still offerred classes on more traditional methods of keeping in shape, though she was certain it&#39;d still have a mysical twist to things. Either way, it&#39;d be an excellent chance to test out this newfound draconic strength that seemed to be sizzling inside her body.<br />
<br />
The whole group was moving alongside her as she headed for the gym. Sofia, Usami, May, Lichi, Amelia, all seemed to be on the same PE class. A welcome relief, as it&#39;d mean her little group of friends was fully present for at least one class in case something went awry. Not to mention, as she briefly thought, the possibility of getting to see May sweating up a storm during whatever exercise they were charged with. They soon joined a whole gaggle of teen girls stepping through the double doors into the gym, each grabbing what looked like a small plastic band off a table on their way inside. Rhonda had an eye raised as she grabbed one, shrugging and tossing it onto her scaly wrist as she entered. There was a brief crackle, as she felt her clothes rapidly reforming - the uniform she&#39;d been wearing becoming a tank top, shorts, and sneakers, all in St. Chariot&#39;s traditional colors - there were even cutouts for her wings and tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat.&quot; She flapped her wings experimentally to confirm that they could still move freely - an act that drew some annoyed glances from people being buffetted by the wind that she generated. &quot;Oh, uh, sorry,&quot; the latina quickly muttered, pulling her wings close once more as she moved to stand between Sofia and Amelia. The former rolled her eyes at Rhonda&#39;s little display, while the other gave her a half-hearted smile, hands busy smoothing out the tail that poked from her shorts. Rhonda gave her a quick thumbs up, figuring the poor girl could use a little reassurance at the moment from one of the other few students to get transformed in their first twenty-four hours.<br />
<br />
By the time the girls had all huddled into a group, what looked to be their teacher was already marching out across the sprawling gymnasium, her attention seemingly glued to the phone in her hands instead of the students. As she approached, Rhonda took a quick look around; among the crowd she could spot that Margo girl from the wards class... and towards the other end of the horde of teenagers was a pair of familiar eyes staring widely at her. <i>Abigail</i>. Rarely had she seen that little brat so incredibly flabbergasted, and the draconic teen knew exactly what was driving her to be so slack-jawed in disbelief. She couldn&#39;t help but look back at her with a smug grin - something about leaving her rival so shocked was just delicious.<br />
<br />
Her attention quickly turned back to the approaching woman, giving her a closer look now that she was stuffing away her phone. Compared to Lancaster or Wandler, she looked relatively normal... <i>relatively</i>. With a thick mane of black hair, a face with a jaw that could cut steel, and a smorgasboard of tattoos decorating all the olive-tone skin that her tank top and cargo pants showed off, she would&#39;ve stood out in any mortal crowd. Though her build was slender and she wasn&#39;t terribly tall, one could see the muscles flexing as she reached up to scratch the back of her head, almond-colored eyes glancing over the crowd of teenagers before her. The two she seemed to linger on the longest were Amelia, and Rhonda herself - to both of them she gave a small sigh, looking up to the sky and muttering something in... Latin?<br />
<br />
&quot;Two in a day, year&#39;s off to a great start.&quot; She shrugged, rubbing her temple a few moments before more directly addressing the girls. There seemed to be a tinge of an accent on her voice, but from what region of the world was hard to guess - it almost sounded like a thousand different accents that had all rolled into a singluar, unique voice. &quot;Alright, since it seems you&#39;re all so eager to turn your bodies into some strange creation-&quot; She gestured to Amelia and Rhonda. &quot;I&#39;ll skip the pleasantries. I am Tiberia, and I will be teaching you how to maintain your physicality without relying on some petty assortment of spells.&quot; She cracked her knuckles. &quot;I&#39;ll also be teaching you how to defend yourselves from nonmagical threats-&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an immediate series of scoffs from several girls, drawing a roll of the eyes from Tiberia. Rhonda wasn&#39;t exactly surprised - a lot of witches, especially brash teenage ones, seemed to believe that anyone lacking in magical ability was no threat to them. They were the kind of girls to dismiss Salem as a fluke, and insist that if <i>they</i> had some mortal witch hunter after them, they could just conjure up a supernatural solution to any potential assault. Even Sofia had bought into that idea in her younger days; the somber look on her face now was an indicator of how much experience had proved her wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, every year I get some chucklefucks like you.&quot; She stepped forward, pacing in front of the assembled girls only a few feet away from the front of the pack. &quot;Oh Coach Tiberia, I don&#39;t need to learn self-defense!&quot; She called out mockingly, &quot;If someone shoots at me, I&#39;ll just throw up an anti-bullet field! Ohhhh, I don&#39;t need to be in shape, I&#39;ll just send my pudge to the dimension of who gives a crap! This class is dumb, I shouldn&#39;t have to be here!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a single, instant flurry, the muscular woman turned, grabbing one of the girls who&#39;d been scoffing by her shoulder and slamming her down into the ground. Her fist made a cutting motion across the girl&#39;s throat as she fell, before swinging around to slam into another girl&#39;s stomach. It wasn&#39;t hard enough to cause permanent harm, but it certainly knocked the wind out of her. Nearby, Sofia stumbled back, yelping as Tiberia turned for a roundhouse kick that came within inches of hitting three more students - the teacher intentionally kept from hitting any of them, and every girl there knew that. She made one final rushing attacking as she jumped past Rhonda, fist swinging by her face and just barely failing to connect.<br />
<br />
With a casual ease she stood back up to attention, glaring at the now rather frightened girls. &quot;If I was actually out to kill you, half of you would be dead already.&quot; Nobody present was about to question that statement. &quot;One knife - that&#39;s all I would have needed. No magic - I&#39;m not even a witch.&quot; There were murmurs of shock at this revelation, but she continued onwards. &quot;There are people out there who want you dead, just for what you are. They are vicious, they are relentless, and they have been perfecting their craft for a very long time. These people know every little trick you&#39;ve got, and they have five different ways to deal with every single one of them. They will pull out shit you&#39;ve never even imagined to drag you down to their level - and if you don&#39;t know how to function down there, you&#39;re <i>dead</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fear was rife among the assembled girls as Tiberia put her hands on her hips, shoulders slightly relaxing. &quot;Now, does anyone else want to make some snippy comments, or can we get class started.&quot; Almost in unison, all of the girls shook their heads. &quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long at all before she was putting the girls through their paces, ordering them out into various exercises - laps around the gym, push-ups, pull-ups, jumping jacks, basic things to give her a good gauge of how fit these witches were. The results were... about the average one would expect for a bunch of teenage girls. For the most part, anyway - Rhonda was standing out from the moment it started. She&#39;d always been physically capable, and with all the newfound strength and endurance that seemed to accompany her draconic form, she was excelling even further. What surprised her is that the only other girl keeping pace was her less pleasant roommate: Abigail was damn near on par with her in terms of fitness, and she couldn&#39;t tell if it was just because the snot had been working out, or if she was being fueled by some particularly powerful brand of spite.<br />
<br />
Either way, by the time Tiberia was finished with running everyone ragged, she seemed to take note of the two girls and their little competition. A few sharp whistles drew the now sweaty and panting students back into a group, some of them already bent over and grabbing at their knees from simple lack of familiarity with running around that much. Sofia, May, and Usami seemed to be doing better than most, but Amelia was panting like an overheated dog, and poor Lichi looked about ready to pass out. &quot;Most of you have a hell of a long way to go,&quot; the coach started, exasperation apparent in her voice. &quot;Some less than others though. You two, the Iberian dragon bitch-&quot; She pointed to Rhonda. &quot;And you, the little shit with the cut-rate magic ass lift.&quot; She jabbed a finger at Abigail, drawing a low growl from the girl. &quot;Step forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls did so without any vocalized complaining, though the glares they were giving each other were remarkable in their intensity. &quot;You two actually seem like you&#39;ve exercised before... and you both want to kill one another.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;I want to see how my two currently-least-awful disasters do in a fight. You two are gonna go get on that mat behind me, and go at each other until one gives up. No magic allowed, no using magic limbs-&quot; She glared briefly at Rhonda. &quot;-and no actually killing each other. Otherwise, go nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though the stipulation that she couldn&#39;t use her wings and tail frustrated Rhonda, there was more than a little excitement at the prospect of getting to beat the crap out of her longtime rival. Abigail seemed just as enticed by the prospect; she was already marching off to the mat and cracking her knuckles. The latina made a show of things by briefly flapping her wings to make a long hop, landing on the other side of the mat and folding the draconic appendages back as she squared up. The other girls, naturally, were forming an excited crowd, some already shouting out bets on who would win. Sofia, Amelia, Usami and May all looked worried - though Lichi, rather unsuprisingly, was shouting at Rhonda and theatrically demanding that she shove Abigail&#39;s head up her own arse. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I never wanted to stoop to your barbaish level,&quot; Abigail sneered as she settled into a boxing stance. &quot;After today, you&#39;ll wish I hadn&#39;t, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up and taking your ass beating like a woman,&quot; Rhonda shot back as she started moving in to make the first strike.</p>
