<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Newborn Dona continued sleeping unconsciously, unaware that she regressed to the point of being born to the world.  And in her mind, she felt completely uncomfortable with the environment around her.  She doesn’t have to worry about walking, talking, or learning in her life.  Not only that, but she forgotten the fact that she had a husband, or boyfriend, or friend name Tray.  Yep, the new life for Dona was completely sweet.  But as she was resting well, another tingling happen in her body.  But this time, it was going to be her last.<br />
<br />
The clip on her umbilical cord vanished without a trace as the cord itself started to grow longer.  At the same time, her diaper faded away, leaving her completely naked with her newborn vagina.  The cord had gotten longer and longer until it stopped at about two to three feet long.  Suddenly, a dome like bubble wrapped around the baby girl and enclosed her in seconds.  Soon after that a strange liquid slowly filled up the dome bubble with Dona in it.  Normally, it would drown the baby girl, but that wasn’t the case.  When the umbilical cord connected to the bubble, Dona didn’t really need to breath since the cord is helping her to stay alive.  Her body then wrapped around into the fetus position, making her feel more comfortable then before.  Now Dona was in a real life womb that doesn’t have a mother entering the ninth month.<br />
<br />
The moment she was inside that womb, her body started to shrink further, making her relive pregnancy in reverse.  Days turn into seconds as Dona was slowly loosing a bit of herself one month at a time.  On month eight, Dona heart beats less and less as she was loosing her antibodies.  Her skin started to loose its thickness the same time fat starts to get less and less on her.<br />
<br />
At month seven, Dona stops feeling everything around her.  She couldn’t understand the moods of her mother, using the 5 of the sixth senses, or know the difference between sleeping and walking.  Her body got smaller as her weight got lighter.  At the same time, her eyelids sealed themselves up, covering her eyes completely.  Her thin black hair slowly shrunk up into her head, leaving her completely bald.<br />
<br />
On her sixth month, her body had gotten much smaller and less noticeable in her appearance.  Both oil and sweat glands stopped functioning as the baby slowly stop moving.  Not only that, but she completely cease breathing the fluids into her no undeveloped lungs.<br />
<br />
By month five, things took a turn for the worse of a now prebirth Dona.  The baby grew smaller and lighter as the dome bubble grew more compact.  Her arms and legs grew shorter as they were slowly sucked into her body.  She then stops dreaming in her sleep but still she was unconscious during her process.<br />
<br />
Month four, and Dona gets less and less noticeable.  Her body was now the size of a baseball and was getting more compact as the bubble decreases some more.  The bone marrow in her body looses its from as her body was more flexible.  Dona’s taste buds were now gone as the vocal cords vanished in her neck.<br />
<br />
In her third moth, Dona’s body was now the size of a tennis ball.  She then looses parts inside her body including the nerves, spinal cord, and thalamus.  Her arms and legs were shorter then ever, as their movement was less flexible.  Her baby teeth in her gums withered away as well as her fingernails.  Lastly her internal organs stopped functioning, making her heart stop beating and her lungs to stop breathing.<br />
<br />
The second month come and go as her skeletal structure dissolved away.  Her entire body was getting smaller then anything and she got rounder.  She lost her fingerprints of her mother, cartilage replaced bone tissue, and she completely lost her hearing.  Other physical changes include eyelids, toes, and nose deteriorating.<br />
<br />
On the very first month, Dona was not herself anymore.  Her brain stopped working as her lips and mouth vanished on her face.  Her fingers shrunk away and all that was left were her hands.  Her arms and legs got sucked up into her body and she was completely limbless.  The liver, kidneys, and intestines lost their shape and were fading away.  Above all else, her spinal column and nervous system went away as well.  With nothing in and out of her body, she merged together and turned into a complete chromosome ball.  Once it was round, the umbilical cord detached from the ball and faded away.  The bubble dome compressed more and more until it was too small to be noticeable.<br />
<br />
When Dona became a ball of embryo flesh, she then divided into many cells and subtracted themselves.  Soon trillions became billions, billions became millions, millions became thousands, thousands became hundreds.  In seconds, the cells became less and less until finally Dona was nothing but a single cell organism.  Just then, another thing happened that was really weird.  Dona started to split in two and she was nothing more then a sperm and egg of her parents.  The bubble dome was nothing more then a drop of liquid on the sofa.  To the point Dona went back to conception.  But without a mom to take care of it, in slowly dried up to nothing as both the sperm and egg cells died instantly.  Now Dona was really gone.<br />
<br />
The moment Dona died of unconception, five-year-old Tray came out of the bathroom and headed back to the living room.  He was still the same as before, except he was a little shorter then before.  He got up on the sofa and continued to watch television, completely unaware that Dona was on the sofa and was now a dried up dead puddle.  He even lost the first memories of Dona, so he completely forgotten about his former wife.  He continued to watch cartoons without knowing the next outcome in his life.</p>
