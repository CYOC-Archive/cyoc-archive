<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the death of every single turn… nothing existed that could keep the curse alive . . .<br />
<br />
With the death of the game, magic reawakened to the rest of the world and could function <br />
again now that mana was not being pulled from around the world to a single point in one <br />
town. <br />
<br />
Only Marie-Eliza's efforts with Judias kept the sudden torrent of three hundred plus years <br />
of sealed up magic turning the entire planet into a pink sky, purple plants planet <br />
populated completely by dancing flowers and various kinds of fae. <br />
<br />
And suddenly magic could work again on planet Earth like the rest of the universe. In all <br />
it's divisions, breeds, incarnations, and types: mana was what powered magic, mana was <br />
generated by anything that existed, flowers, emotions, fantasy, dolls, space, fire, radio <br />
signals, even the void of nothingness generated it's own kind of mana. And the infinite <br />
chaos, which enabled one to WIELD magic, and enabled magic to function, now had mana <br />
again to act as a medium between magic and existence, between magic and the sapient <br />
mind. <br />
<br />
Rick got his wish to be a little girl . . . eventually . . . after it mutated into a fixation, that <br />
devolved into am obsession, which twisted into a mania. The birth of his daughter years <br />
did not help matters as it should.  He dived into magic . . . but was as foolish and reckless <br />
as the witches . . .  <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza could have stopped the react that Rick invoked that engulfed him, his family <br />
and his house years later . . . but chose not to. It didn't threaten the entire landmass of <br />
Australia. And if she stopped this, Rick would simply find his ideal of being a little girl not <br />
what he thought it was and become simply MORE fixated or try to figure out why nothing <br />
happened and hurt his family and himself even more.<br />
<br />
The police found a house sized doll-house, and four little girls all responding to the name <br />
'Rachel' wondering where their mother was.  All would grow up engrained into their psyche <br />
the need to 'FULLY READ THE DIRECTIONS AND WARNINGS' when performing any sort of <br />
magic. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
Amber was actually slightly disappointed that Akane-Mu Umeko-Mu Chiyoye-Lambda and <br />
Eri-Mu hadn't either kept their oversized double beachball plus breasts… or hadn't gone <br />
totally flat chested. <br />
<br />
Yamato didn't care about the size of his wives breasts, he was just happy that they could <br />
live their lives easier now without such distracting inconveniences. <br />
<br />
Following the advice given to him, Yamato-Lambda did decide to help Nicole with her <br />
martial arts classes. Nicole did indeed welcome the help, thought she did on occasion butt <br />
heads with Yamato over the best way to do about teaching the younger pack members. <br />
<br />
At his wedding Ulysses looked at the purple smiling angel statue with her great wings and <br />
spread out arms like she was hugging the bride and grooms, having no idea that a statue <br />
was missing at the shrine or that the angel statue hadn't been there a year ago, or <br />
yesterday for that matter. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wendy, Jessica, Rose, and Betty and  Robert kept good ties with the manor's living statues. <br />
As did Triny and Kimberly. Kimberly was determined to find a man if it killed her. She was <br />
beginning to consider of the leomans as a mate. It wasn't impossible. They were all species <br />
of Man after all. <br />
<br />
Kimberly said, &quot;We pink furred wolves are a special breed. Ya know they're still hoping <br />
Lupman and Leoman crossing breeding will produce the first pink lioness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pink was considered a manly color long before it was considered a girlie one.&quot;  <br />
<br />
MOnkey King aka Kira was able to recruit other wolves, leoman and humans to Alpha <br />
Kaylee's gallery over the years, though to call it kidnapping would be unfair. Any of them <br />
were free to live and continue their lives whenever they wished, even if Kayee insisted on a <br />
service performance art contract to seal the deal. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Somewhere, across deserts, oceans, and up mountains, a collection of Lupman skeletons <br />
lay. They had left their families back in America in Glendale, planning to be the first <br />
Lupmans to climb Mount Everest WITHOUT breathing equipment. A risk a thousand times <br />
over, some called it even suicidal, but people of history where those who took risks, those <br />
who dared. <br />
<br />
Felmans actually had scaled Mount Everest first, their bodies requiring less oxygen, <br />
gargoyles didn't breath, but were not a species known for ambition seeing things age of <br />
old age around them. Humans had been a close second. Leomans and Lupmans were only <br />
able to reach the top without falling into unconsciousness and needing to be carted back <br />
down once Oxygen masks had been invented.  A few dragons in ancient times had <br />
supposed tried and succeeded, but hadn't come back down the most sane of sorts. <br />
<br />
The felmans simply didn't require as much air, when the amount Lupmans and Leomans <br />
required made scaling the mountain a herculean effort on the best of days for the most <br />
experienced climbers. <br />
<br />
These Lupmans, whose fur had been the colors of precious stones, had sought to challenge <br />
the mountain. To prove they were stronger than it was . . . The mountain proved itself <br />
superior. The last member of their group had actually died about a dozen yard from the <br />
very peak . . . but snow had hidden the bones. <br />
<br />
One of Marie-Eliza's avatars using the astounding power of Kurse, found them . .  . she <br />
collected their journals . . . She'd let the pack decide if they should remain here on the <br />
mountain they had challenged or returned home later.  She gave the journal to Madam <br />
Serenity, who gave it to Martha . . . who knew she had some more tears to work through <br />
the teen wolves . . . <br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
A few years later Madam Serenity with some help from Marie-Eliza found some other truths <br />
about another set of twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;What about Jay, Pence, Toni and Paula's parents?&quot;  Anne asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're their mother. And Megan, Ashley and Margot are their aunts, and Lawrence is their <br />
father. Jay and Pence's parents died trying to provide for them.   Toni and Paul's parents -<br />
ABANDONED- their pups. Trust me when I say it's better they weren't raised by them <br />
anyway, they wouldn't have turned out for the better.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got some DNA testing . . .  please don't ask why their DNA was doing on profile . . . &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you then… for at least providing me with some answers…&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got to ask.&quot; the copper Gillian II said to Patrick, AKA Mr. P, the gold and black four <br />
legged wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ask what?&quot; Mr. P asked innocently at what was the celebration of the senior Pride <br />
members to the death of the game. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you unhappy that I'm back in Marilyn's life? You two know each other so dearly it <br />
seems… I don't want to intrude upon any happiness the two of you have. It would be <br />
uncivilized.&quot;  Gillian II asked, looking small. <br />
<br />
Mr. P laughed, &quot;Sonny, and yes I say sonny, I'm much older than I look. Snow White and I <br />
are FRIENDS. We're not THOSE KINDS of friends either!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillian looked relieved that Mr. P had not said 'just friends.'  &quot;So, the pet names, Blackie, <br />
and Snow White-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Mr P. continued,  &quot;They're not pet names, they're nicknames. I know you've seen the <br />
world's past on without you, and you've had to outlive your children which is something NO <br />
parent should ever have to do, believe me, I've had to deal with that myself… but believe <br />
me when I say that I'm not attracted to Snow White that way. We're kindred spirits, sure, <br />
we've both had to deal with not having hands, and not being able to sit in chairs, and often <br />
not able to look some people in the face… but that isn't love. There's a difference between <br />
being companions on a journey, and being part of a whole… you're part of Snow White's <br />
whole. So seriously, there's no one better to help teach you . . .  and don't forget, you've <br />
got lions who have been 'out of the loop' a lot longer than you. No no no, I'm not trying to <br />
make you feel bad about there being people less fortunate than you, there always is. What <br />
I'm saying that Arael and Armisael and Gabriel, and Mal'Akh Bialyk too, hopefully have you <br />
as a bridge, I know you've hardly been frozen a hundred and fifty years like some of them <br />
or more so, but seriously they need help adapting to this world one step at a time, and they <br />
need you as that stepping stone…. SO SERIOUSLY! Don't worry about me getting between <br />
you and Snow White! My only wife I ever had is waiting in heaven for me right now. Snow <br />
White is all yours if she'll have you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Patrick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Mr. P, just about everyone does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Glen meanwhile was on the roof. She wondered how much time she and Blackie had <br />
left, there was no way to know how much more time their uniquely long life spans would <br />
last.  However long it was Mother Glen was happy to have lived long enough to see the end <br />
of this horrid game.  &quot;Now I just need to figure out who to select as a successor for <br />
Matriarch…&quot; <br />
<br />

Fox and Elise' funeral, involved much of the pride, though their fellow police were allowed <br />
the closer seats. The leoman who couldn't attended due to their duty or some other harsh <br />
regulation, did allow themselves some time out of their day still to send a message of <br />
sympathy to the eight cubs, Gary and Brian.  As per Nane's Transform in the previous <br />
timeline, a statue of the two was made in the honor of the two fallen police officers, mates, <br />
Primate Mates, and mothers. <br />
<br />
It was all most could do to keep from crying as they retold Fox's antics that Nane had <br />
picked up on and Elise's sense of duty that Moja had picked up on.  There was more than <br />
one speech about how Elise and Fox survived through their daughters.  With nothing to <br />
bury, the funeral ended with the unveiling of the statue. <br />
<br />

<br />
When Jensen's wives came back from the Caribbean vacation pregnant, Kevin and Marcy <br />
were overjoyed at the idea of having more siblings.  Bart and Jenny were worried their <br />
parents wanted kids who were more 'normal.' And Alice, Abbey and Samantha were all <br />
worried THEIR mothers wanted girls who were perfectly in sync with each other where Alice <br />
had over a year in age separating herself from her cousins/half-sisters.   <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny might have been collage degree level smart, and Alice might have known <br />
language better than most adults, but they were still children, and naked to the same <br />
vulnerabilities and doubts that all children faced. This was of course part of the reason why <br />
Bart and Jenny turned all the Omegas except Martha into their shadows using the turn they <br />
got from Bobby (who they eventually tracked down and made an 'honorary' member of the <br />
pack as an apology of tricking and using him). <br />
<br />
Alice, Abbey and Samantha had even run away into the mirror world and had taken Bart <br />
and Jenny with them… <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza thankfully provided the parents and siblings with a door into the world where <br />
everyone including Lupmans and Leomans wore victorian era clothing and where the laws <br />
of existence faded the further you were away from the last thing that had been reflected. <br />
<br />
It had taken days of searching even with Marie-Eliza's help to track them down to the <br />
mirror world version of Big Bad Island. And had taken a number of heart felt words that no, <br />
Jensen and Kaylee were HAPPY their children were so unique and brilliant, and no, the <br />
triplets DIDN'T care their babies weren't in perfect sync with each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;But we want to be like you.&quot; Abbey said at last. <br />
<br />
&quot;Being in sync,&quot; The triplets said in one voice, one tone, as they took their daughters into <br />
their arms, &quot;Feeling the same, thinking the same, acting the same, BEING the same, is what <br />
makes us unique dear! Just as being the beautiful little glass wolves you are is what makes <br />
you unique… we wouldn't trade you for the world!&quot; <br />
<br />
It shocked Kevin and Marcy most of all… to learn their elder siblings were jealous of THEM <br />
for being normal! <br />
<br />
<br />
When their children were finally home and finally in bed, the triplets went to the roof, the <br />
star gazer club having already gone to bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you regret that we're identical?&quot; Fran asked Darla and Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least.&quot; Julie replied to her sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nor do I.&quot;  Darla added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don't either… I know a lot of other triplets don't like us for being the way we are <br />
but--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them feel what they want to feel, they leave us alone, and they don't bother our <br />
family.&quot; Said Julie, very happy to have the burden of looking after so many finally off her <br />
shoulders and enjoyed very much the vacation she had gotten and to have children safe <br />
and home again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And we're still not certified doctors, and Julie is still not a certified cop.&quot; Said Darla, &quot;We <br />
have different roles the three of us even if our hearts and minds are reflections of each <br />
other.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Fran said smiling, &quot;And we understand each other on a level that's not possible for <br />
anyone else with anyone else, even Jensen, thought I wouldn't trade him for anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla and Julie nodded. <br />
<br />
The three triplets leaned into each other, hugging each other, but none too hard least they <br />
unset the tiny new lives developing inside themselves.  The three smiled at the same time <br />
and together like mirror images stood up and howled in one voice at the moon. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
 Caroline and Cobalt did eventually fuse back into one, and that was when Opal finally <br />
married her now that she was no longer a them. She was neither personality, but a unity of <br />
the two, and that was how she liked it. <br />
Tourmaline Ruby and Emerald chose to become Opal's wives… rather than Opal rather <br />
asking them… it made for an interesting wedding. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gargent and Amber, chose to remain single and become the official permanent Lupman <br />
presence on Big Bad Island.  Not everyone needed to get married to find happiness after all. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Amy wasn't very surprised when Marie-Eliza invited her for tea, she was surprised when <br />
she asked Zelipe to join them.  Zelipe was quite happy to take up the offer. They asked <br />
permission from their parents, Zackery, June and Pearl of course. Who saw no reason to say <br />
no.  Having tea in the mirror verse however, was a surprise.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Marie-Eliza assured them, &quot;I brought the tea and everything from the <br />
outside, nothing will turn to glass in your bellies.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zelipe looked quite relieved at that. <br />
<br />
The two pups hadn't expected Eliza herself to be there as well, apparently acting a <br />
chaperone. Eliza in a red and black version of Marie-Eliza's black and red dress, but didn't <br />
have the runes that Marie-Eliza's dress had. <br />
<br />
Amy was dressed as a Shinto priestess with the symbol for 'Ookami' that would mean wolf <br />
or great god on her robes.  Zelipe looked like your typical working class lad, complete with <br />
a small flop heat with holes for his ears. <br />
<br />
Where Marie chose to have tea was a surprise for Amy and Zelipe. They had tea at the edge <br />
of the universe. After all, there were reflective surfaces on more than just Earth. <br />
<br />
This far out, the laws of reality were completely absent. Impossible shapes floated by, <br />
inferred and ultra violet were in the visible spectrum while green was not. And stars the <br />
size of grains of sand drifted around them. <br />
<br />
Zelipe asked the obvious question first, &quot;What's beyond the edge of the universe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EIther infinite nothing, another universe, you just step back into this universe, or nothing <br />
in the sense you can't even go beyond the boundaries, I don't know…. Heh, want to find <br />
out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, not today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. This is tea, not an adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;Adventures are good and all, build character, but you have to eventually <br />
move on in life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eliza said, &quot;Life is an adventure in of itself. Remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three pups nodded.</p>
