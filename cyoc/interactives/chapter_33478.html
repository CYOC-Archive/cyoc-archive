<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a couple of hours to get to Sarah's safe house. When you get there you see that it's a decent size. When you enter into the house you step into a modest foyer with stairs leading up and to the right.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bedrooms are upstairs&quot; Sarah said as she started climbing the stairs. &quot;I never thought that I'd be using all three of the bedrooms but this was the only one that was secluded enough to be used as a safe house. There are three bedrooms each with two beds. Two of them share a half bath while the other has a full bath. Violet, you'll share one with Megan. Brian, you'll share with Jason. Tanya, you'll be with me and Alice. I want everyone to stay awake until Tanya and I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When will we be able to return to the clan house?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Sarah said, &quot;we may not be able to go back for awhile. Could you open this door for me Violet?&quot;<br />
<br />
You open the door Sarah asked you to open and she goes in. You follow her in and notice that it was one of the bedrooms. The walls were a cream color as was the bedspread on the beds. There were a couple of nightstands by the beds and a table with flowers on it by the window. A wardrobe stood in one corner. The beds were twin sized and the bedding on them appeared to be clean. Everything in the house appeared to be clean.<br />
<br />
You were just about to ask Sarah how everything was clean when she said &quot;Don't worry about the beds being clean. I've had a maid service come in every other day and clean. They were just here today as a matter of fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah laid Megan on one of the beds and then went someplace and returned with some gauze pads and tape. She then took off Megan's ruined shirt and dressed the wound. After she was done she said &quot;I want you to stay with Megan and change her dressing if need be. I also want you to stay close in case anybody decides to come in so you can mist her out of here quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll show you the other bedrooms then Tanya and I will leave for a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah left and you were alone with Megan. She definitely looked dead and you wonder if you looked like that when you were turned. You decided that you probably did look like you had died. You reach out and touch Megan's face. You don't know why you did that but you did. You started to wonder if Sarah did this same thing while you were transforming. She probably did.<br />
<br />
You hear a sound and look up to see Jason standing in the door. &quot;May I come in&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you may come in&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;To think that I now have a daughter&quot; Jason said. &quot;I know that this will seem a little odd to you since you were turned just recently. I mean she's 13 and I'm 14. Who would really think of me as her father. At least I'll be able to look more the part as the years go by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;When a vampire's age reaches the same as their physical age, the vampire can choose to age along with the years&quot; Jason said. &quot;I was turned 14 years ago so I can age now. In 13 years I'll look and be 27. Also a vampire can choose the age they appear as once they reach their physical age. They can not appear younger than their turned physical age though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So in 13 years I'll be able to choose what age I look like?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll still look 13 no matter what age you want to look like&quot; Jason said. &quot;There is a range that you'll be stuck with. I've already told you that you can't appear younger than your turned physical age. For you that means you can't appear younger than 13. Now the upper limit is restricted by your turned age. That means that at 20 years after you were turned you could appear up to 20 years old. You can appear as any age within that range.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I live to 200 years old I could choose to look like any age from 13 to 200?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Jason said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good to know&quot; you say. &quot;I do have a question for you. Megan said that you had told her that you were a vampire and that you wanted a daughter. Were you planning on turning her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I was but not until we were about 30&quot; Jason said. &quot;Tonight just changed those plans. I hope that she'll be able to move on from me. She could probably go with Brian if Tom doesn't get together with Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brian's already taken&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;By who?&quot; Jason asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;By me&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you certainly moved fast&quot; Jason said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do believe in love at first sight&quot; you say. &quot;There's something about Brian that just calls to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I see&quot; Jason said. &quot;I want to ask you a question. Why were you at Megan's grandparent's house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan is my niece from before I was turned&quot; you say with a wicked smile on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that Megan has an uncle that I met a few times&quot; Jason said. &quot;He's into vampires like Megan is. I wonder if he ever thought about actually becoming a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I did many times&quot; you say. &quot;Now I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see realization dawn on Jason's face. &quot;You were Megan's uncle&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I should be getting back downstairs&quot; Jason said. &quot;I need to watch for anybody approaching the house.&quot; With that he turned around and left.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later Sarah came back in. &quot;Well did you need to change Megan's dressing?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Sarah hands you a nightshirt and says &quot;Alright, go ahead and change into that nightshirt and get into bed. You can sleep in if you want since there won't be a council meeting for awhile. I do want you up before Meagan wakes up so you can explain what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you say and you start to undress. You don't think that Megan will be upset that she's a vampire now. She may wonder why she isn't dead though. You'll also have to explain that Jason is her father now. She's going to be a little confused about all of this. It could be an interesting day.</p>
