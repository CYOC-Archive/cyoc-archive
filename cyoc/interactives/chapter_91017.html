<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After getting caught up with my classes so that I had some time available, I went to see Blake again. Before he opened the door I announced, &quot;Let me get undressed first.&quot; He opened the door holding the shrink ray. I came inside and stripped quickly and as soon as I was naked, he shrunk me again. Then he went back to his notebook and ignored me. He forgot to put me on his desk so I started climbing up his pants leg. My new tail proved helpful. Then I climbed his shirt. When I got to his shoulder, he turned and kissed me.<br />
<br />
I asked him. &quot;What are you working on today?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;I&#39;m low on inspiration today. I&#39;ve been tinkering with some old ideas but I&#39;m not making any progress today.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Sorry. Hey why don&#39;t we go visit the biology department. Maybe you just need a little collaboration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;It&#39;s a little late. They might have gone home.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;It&#39;s not that late yet. A few biologists might be around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake agreed. I climbed down and into his pocket. Although Blake lived near campus, it was still a long walk of about two miles (more than 3 kilometers) crossing two streets lined with storefronts.<br />
<br />
We got to the biology department and there were a few biologists still hanging around including Tim. After greeting, Tim took me aside for a moment to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You lied and I think you&#39;ve been lying a lot.&quot; Tim said. &quot;Lying can get you in trouble. However, in this case, I may be able to save you. You told your friends that the biology department is paying you to be a lab rat. You told us that you wanted to learn what it&#39;s like from the animal&#39;s perspective. That&#39;s two lies. Now, I think I already know what the truth is but I want to hear it from your mouth. Why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t plan any of this. I just got swept along into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;You do know. And it has something to do with Blake, am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Well, he&#39;s my friend. But other than that, I don&#39;t see what this has to do with Blake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;He&#39;s jealous for you. Friends don&#39;t get jealous for each other. There&#39;s more to your relationship than just friendship, isn&#39;t there?&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t say anything but I thought Tim saw right through me and knew exactly what I felt. He nodded. &quot;Yes, there is more to your relationship. You&#39;re here for him. He wants to hang out with us. You don&#39;t. But by letting him bring you here, you&#39;re helping him bridge the gap and connect with us. That is certainly more than just a friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just looked at him but we both knew he was right.<br />
<br />
Tim continued, &quot;Your other friends like the one I met, they are just friends, nothing more. But you felt a need to justify your involvement with us. So you lied and told them we were paying you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down.<br />
<br />
Tim continued, &quot;Well okay. We don&#39;t normally pay lab rats. But I think we can work out an arrangement that is in everyone&#39;s best interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim picked me up by my tail and brought me back to Blake. Blake looked nervous. Tim put me in Blake&#39;s hand and then he put his arm around Blake. &quot;Blake, friend, I&#39;d love to collaborate with you and your lab rat.&quot; Tim moved Blake&#39;s arms to encourage him to hold me closer to his chest. I took the cue and nestled in Blake&#39;s hands. Blake smiled and relaxed.<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;I&#39;d like to try some things on a human but some of what I want to try would be unethical so I&#39;ve been doing animal testing. Since you have a human lab rat, I could bypass some ethical standards with him. I&#39;ll even pay him a little if you&#39;re willing to work with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;No, nothing cruel. You&#39;re not going to do anything cruel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;Absolutely no cruelty. This department has set high standards for preventing cruelty. No I&#39;m talking about bypassing ethical standards such as allowing him to wear clothes or having to use a bedside manner with him. I&#39;m talking about dignities we have to give a human that we don&#39;t have to give animals. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake looked down at me and asked, &quot;Is that okay with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I answered, &quot;It&#39;s okay with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;Alright. Let&#39;s drop the lab rat in with the others and you and I can go discuss the details. I&#39;m hungry. Let&#39;s get some pizza. I&#39;ll even buy.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Tim sprayed me with something, dropped me by my tail in with the other lab rats and then he and Blake left. Now it was my turn to be nervous.<br />
<br />
I think my fellow lab rats were mice but I&#39;m not sure. They were nervous too. I smelled myself to learn what Tim sprayed me with and I smelled feminine and mouselike.<br />
<br />
I settled myself to just get comfortable and wait. The mice overcame their shyness and approached me. They weren&#39;t aggressive. They were just curious. They sniffed me. It was proof that this biology department had not been cruel because, although the mice were understandably shy, they weren&#39;t terrified. The mice began touching me, climbing on top of me, sniffing my hair. When their curiosity was satisfied, they settled down and I found myself cozily snuggled in a pile of mice.<br />
<br />
I must have dozed off. I woke up and all the lights were off and the building was empty. Blake must have saw me sleeping and didn&#39;t want to disturb me. So he went home and left me to spend the night with the lab rats.<br />
<br />
Mice are active at night. They are very playful and I played along. Sometimes they got defensive when I didn&#39;t understand the game and broke the rules but if I backed off, they&#39;d relax and we could play again.<br />
<br />
I got sleepy and settled down to sleep the rest of the night but I heard playful mice all night long.<br />
<br />
I woke up again when all the lights were turned on. As the biologists streamed in, many of them were greeted by the sight of me playing in with the mice. Many of them laughed and said, &quot;Our human lab rat is back.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a while, one of them pulled me out by my tail. He looked me over and said, &quot;You&#39;re a little dirty. You want a bath?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took me to the sink and scrubbed me with soap. Then he looked me over to make sure I was clean.<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;What was I sprayed with last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;That&#39;s a combination of mouse pheromones to help keep the mice calm. Having a male in the cage might scare them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, Tim arrived. &quot;Thank you for washing him up but he can stay in the mouse cage until Blake gets here.&quot; Tim looked at me. &quot;You do have some time this morning don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; and I was given another spray of female mouse pheromones and dropped in the cage.<br />
<br />
Blake showed up soon after. He greeted me but then he and Tim went off somewhere to work. Several students came by and saw me in the mouse cage. Pete even came by.<br />
<br />
Finally Blake came and got me out of the cage. Tim and Pete were with him. I asked, &quot;Pete, don&#39;t you have classes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;I saw you here and decided to skip so I could watch. I talked to Tim and he agreed to let me be an assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt nervous about Pete being an assistant. Blake pulled out the shrink ray and fired it at me. The only part of me that changed was my genitals. I was still one foot tall but my dick hung down to my ankle. My balls were also bigger. Thy didn&#39;t reach my ankles but reached about half way to my knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this about?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;I&#39;m doing a study on virility. I&#39;m trying to develop some drugs like viagra only better. Once a week, one of us is going to collect semen samples from you, as many semen samples as we can get to determine how effective the drugs are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; I asked. &quot;What if I don&#39;t want to give any semen samples?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;Then you won&#39;t get paid.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at the faces of all three. &quot;Blake, did you just design these changes to the shrink ray?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;No, I have millions of ideas in my head that I bounce around. I&#39;d already figured out this design before but just hadn&#39;t set it in yet. I can make you other sizes as well but I prefer you one foot tall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim added, &quot;Your genitals are not huge. Your balls are normal size but with you at one sixth of normal size it may seem like you have huge balls. Your cock is just a little bit larger than average size. We made it larger to make it easier to collect semen samples and that isn&#39;t the only thing that changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;What else changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete came over and stuck his finger in my ass. Tim said, &quot;We also made your anus more elastic so we could more easily stimulate your prostate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete grabbed my cock and picked me up. With one finger up my ass and a hand stroking my cock, I flailed around in the air looking for something to hold onto. Tim prepared to catch my semen samples.<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;What about the drug?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;Drugs will come later. We first need to establish a baseline of what&#39;s normal for you without drugs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grabbed Pete&#39;s finger with my tail and prepared myself to give semen samples. I kept my eyes on Blake.</p>
