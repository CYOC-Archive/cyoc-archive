<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>You look at yourself, admiring the new werewolf that you have become, not really wanting to be a werewolf for life though while leaving the downstairs area. Wanting to get accustomed to the way things would be, especially if you chose to wear this costume again sometime, you go about your daily activity as a werewolf. Not really paying too much attention to the time, it slips by and before you know it, your Uncle Jack calls you back downstairs to the eat-in area within the kitchen. The main living area of the house was added on behind what used to be the main portion of the house, which his uncle had turned into the costume shop.</Br>
<Br>Seeing that you were still in the costume, your uncle looks at you with wide eyes. "I see you are still in your costume... so I am assuming you like being a werewolf then?"</Br>
<Br>"You know, I do... being this way is kind of comfortable. Besides, I really want to do everything that I would normally do throughout my day in this costume so I know what it would be like if I wore it again."</Br>
<Br>"I guess I can understand that. It is nice to get used to something so you can be aware of the pluses and minuses involved."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, so what is for dinner?"</Br>
<Br>"I made what I call Chicken in a Blanket Pilaf. Basically, a breast of chicken, wrapped in bacon, topped with nuts and bread crumbs served over a bed of rice combined with some veggies."</Br>
<Br>"Wow, that really sounds good uncle! I didn't know you knew how to cook like that!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, it is somewhat of a pastime that I have picked up over the years. So, eat up because it is getting late and you should be taking off the costume soon so you don't fall asleep with it on."</Br>
<Br>"Good thinking uncle, you really keep my best interest in mind don't you?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, I always have, even when my brother had me watch you while he and your mother were away for a long period of time."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah... I can remember how often you looked after me when I was younger. I really appreciate that and how I am sure you made sure that I didn't get into any of your other costumes."</Br>
<Br>"Well... that part was easy really. What you don't know is that I have locked you in the closet for weeks at a time and then erased your memory so you thought everything was hunky dory and were none-the-wiser."</Br>
<Br>You look at him with shock, surprised to hear that coming from someone who you thought you could trust, but you also notice that he could not help but to crack a smile. "You are just pulling my werewolf leg aren't you?"</Br>
<Br>Your uncle just burst out into laughter, not being able to keep the lie going. "Hahaha, no... I never did do that!"</Br>
<Br>You both chuckled while finishing up dinner for the evening. When you were done, which was faster than normal but that was because of your new wolfish self, you got up to help your uncle with the dishes. It was weird at first, handling the dishes with your claws and your prehensile wolf paws, but when you figured out how to retract the claws, things were more normal.</Br>
<Br>After the dishes were done, the kitchen was cleaned up and everything had pretty much been taken care of, you and Uncle Jack head upstairs for the evening. Still in your werewolf costume, uncle Jack becomes worried, thinking you may either want to keep it on or will inevitably fall asleep in it. Before you part ways at the fork at the top of the stairs, he puts a firm hand on your shoulder and held you in place so he could talk to you.</Br>
<Br>"Hey... remember, take the costume off before it gets too late and you fall asleep with it on. This is the last time that I will be warning you because this is the last time you and I will see each other before morning."</Br>
<Br>"Don't worry Uncle Jack..." you say with a voice of comfort "I won't forget. I don't think I want to be a werewolf for the rest of my life. If that does happen, I would be one lonely creature because I would be the only one of my kind."</Br>
<Br>Uncle Jack releases his hand from your shoulder, smiles, then nods as he walks into his room for the evening, closing the door behind him. Seeing that he was finally in his room, you enter yours, turning the television on almost immediately while getting your Playstation 3 ready to play for some Resistance 2. Getting on the game, holding the controller in your werewolf form was odd and hard at first, but just like the dishes you figured it out and it felt even more natural to play this way. The entire time you were playing, you were playing online since that offered more to do and you were kicking butt. You realized while looking at your skirmish scoring, your entire performance was better. Your sight, your reflexes, and everything else important to playing that game was heightened and you loved it. You knew that it was after midnight and dawn would be coming soon, but you didn't want to stop since you were DOMINATING everyone. You played and you played for what seemed like hours, but was really only minutes before the strain of keeping your eyes trained on the game took it's toll.</Br>
<Br>Suddenly, in a fit of panic, you woke up while literally jumping off the bed. Thinking to yourself <I>Oh no, oh crap... I fell asleep! What time is it, did the sun come up yet? I am so screwed!</I> but then you look around, it was still dark out and you definitely weren't in your wolf costume anymore. Confused, you think to yourself <I>Huh!? I must have removed the costume in my sleep because it's not on me, it's not on the floor or the bed and it is still dark. Whew... and I thought I made a huge mistake!</I></Br>
<Br>Suddenly, you heard something unfamiliar. It sounded like running water that was faint, like it was far away. Looking around, you didn't see any water anywhere and you didn't have access to a bathroom on this floor. Shrugging it off, you start to ready yourself for bed, but then something strange happened. You heard the water shut off, you heard someone stepping out of a shower or tub and you heard somebody say <I>I hope that nephew of mine took that costume off since it is well after sunrise</I></Br>
<Br>In a fit of panic you start screaming in your mind, there was no way that you fell asleep in that costume. You look around, realizing that your uncle didn't have a clock in the room for you to use since school had been out for the summer. Panicked, you exit completely out of the game to the XMB where you could see that it was seven thirty in the morning. More panicked, you raise the blinds in a fit, and that was answer enough for you... as the sun shone in your newer, more sensitive eyes.</Br>
<Br>Not believing this, you yell at yourself <I>What am I going to do? I can't believe I fell asleep with that thing on! Crap... is Uncle Jack ever going to be mad!</I> Knowing that there was nothing you could do to rewind time and make sure to take the costume off, you prepared yourself for your uncle's typical morning visit.</Br>
<Br>Hearing him walking through his room, hearing the robe brush against his hairy, well built, muscular body with nothing on underneath, you were amazed by the level of acuity you received from the costume. You could hear him walk through his room, to the door and then the door opened. A few squeaky board steps later, Uncle Jack was at your door knocking.</Br>
<Br>Not knowing what was going to happen now, you quickly jump to your feet, seeing your naked body that was different from how it was last night before putting on the costume and stand there in a bit of shock. Knowing that this was not the time, with your uncle knocking at the door, you quickly grabbed a large plaid robe that your uncle stored in that room as a second closet. Becoming impatient, your uncle began talking, and what you thought would have been muffled through the wooden door was actually as clear as his morning routine.</Br>
<Br>"Hey buddy, are you ok in there? You did take off that costume like I warned... right?"</Br>
<Br>Not knowing what to say, you were about to speak... that was until you heard the lower resonating voice that started coming from your vocal chords. Concerned about you, your uncle spoke out again. "Hey buddy, are you alright in there? Do you want me to come in there so we can talk?"</Br>
<Br>Still panicked, knowing there was nothing you could do, you just put the robe over your new and different body, then sat on the bed to wait for your uncle to come in. He was going to come in regardless if you spoke or not and you knew that he would immediately realize your mistake when he saw the new you. Without your response, your uncle knocked twice, announced his entering and walked in to see you sitting on your bed.</Br>
<Br>At first, when he saw you, he was just in shock at how you looked. When he mustered the ability to speak, he started to speak, but he just shook his head slowly from side to side. Uncle Jack then walked up to you, put his large hand on your shoulder, while you looked up at him and he smiled.</Br>
<Br>With a slight chuckle, Uncle Jack started talking. "So... I guess you didn't take that costume off last night... did you?"</Br>
<Br>You held your head low, ashamed of not following his advice and when you began to speak, Uncle Jack smiled hearing the new voice. It was raw, it was manly and it definitely suited the newer you. "No uncle Jack, I was playing my video game and the next thing I knew, I woke up to this new body and the sun shining."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, so what are you going to do now?"</Br>
<Br>"I don't know... my life is over as I knew it. I can't go back to school like this, I can't go back home to my parents like this, my life is ruined!"</Br>
<Br>"Hey bud..." He said as uncle Jack lifted your manly head up "It really isn't that bad! Have you seen the newer you?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I think it is pretty cool but how am I supposed to go back to my normal life?"</Br>
<Br>Your uncle smiled as he helped you back to your feet, while you caught a glimpse of his flaccid pecker, without really intending on it. When you were on your newer, manly and large somewhat hairy feet, he walked you to his walk-in closet and let you look at yourself in the full body mirror. Looking at yourself, you were in a bit of shock toward your new body. You looked at your older self, checking out your older and stubble covered face, with a toothy smile where you see your perfect white teeth. Peering in closer, you noticed that your I-teeth were sharper, fang-like, but not as long as they were in the costume. Curious about everything else, you flex your new larger muscles and you could not help but to feel joy. You looked like a muscular, dark tanned, hairy lumberjack. Your chest was huge, as were your biceps along with your thighs. Your forearms were nicely tapered, covered in the thick and dark body hair. Your lower legs were also covered in the thick and dark body hair, while your calves were nice and large with great definition. Not getting the chance to look at your own pecker, since you were in a hurry to do something about yourself earlier when there really wasn't anything you could do, you just look down with your eyes toward the reflection, but didn't see anything because of the covering. You then look at Uncle Jack and he just smiles.</Br>
<Br>"Go ahead buddy, we both got the same thing between our legs. Besides, if I were in your situation, going from average teen to humongous lumberjack overnight, I would do the same thing!"</Br>
<Br>You just smile while moving the cloth out of the way, but your smile grows even larger when you see your new friend. It was definitely thicker than you ever could remember it being when flaccid, with a nicely mushroom shaped head. Looking even further, you notice your pelvic area looked trim and your balls were definitely bigger and devoid of hair... which was nice because you liked it neat down there, but you never really had much to be proud of... especially when you were just average in that department.</Br>
<Br>Your uncle just chuckled when he saw your reaction to your new equipment. "You know... you do have a nice set! I wish I were that lucky to go through what you just did and have that reaction."</Br>
<Br>You smile while not knowing if you should say what was on your mind, which your uncle caught onto right away.</Br>
<Br>"Hey... if you got anything to say, feel free to do so! I am not ashamed of myself and you shouldn't be either."</Br>
<Br>Shrugging your newly massive shoulders you decide to say what you wanted. "Well Uncle Jack, when you stood me up, I caught a glimpse of your set and I wouldn't complain if I were you."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I know... the thing is... mine is naturally big. Yours on the other hand, well it was augmented by magic. I would have actually liked to have one day woken up like that, like you did this morning. For a long time, when I was your age, I never really had a set to be proud of. In fact, I was small compared to all the other guys in high school. It wasn't until after I turned twenty-two did I get what I have now. Even though I love what I have now, I wish I could have had it back then. I was embarrassed about my size and I always wondered when I would bloom in that department. Then one day, I decided that it wasn't worth worrying about, but then like I told you, it was bigger like I had always wanted it to be."</Br>
<Br>"I see... don't you think this is a bit queer to be doing right now?"</Br>
<Br>"Nah, not at all. This is something that men in most families do with one another. Of course, this type of situation doesn't arise, but when we saw our dad... your grandfather... walk around and become exposed, we had the same talk we are having now. Of course, we didn't sit and compare junk."</Br>
<Br>You both chuckled, but then you continued... concerned about what to do now. "Alright, so what am I going to do now? Everything about me is different and this is entirely unexplainable to people. My mom and dad would understand because I am sure they know about your wizardry, but my friends on the other hand wouldn't be able to understand."</Br>
<Br>"Well... you need to remember, I am a wizard so I have tricks up my sleeve to fix your current situation. Did your dad ever tell you that I am gay?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I asked about why you never had a woman by your side or why I didn't have an aunt already. When he got sick of making excuses for you, not knowing how I would take it before he told me the truth, he told me and it made complete sense. Why do you ask?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... I can manipulate the world so that you are acceptable the way you are, especially when you transform. I can make it one of two ways."</Br>
<Br>Anxious to hear how he would be able to fix things, you somewhat rudely interrupt him. "Oh ok, what are my options?"</Br>
<Br>Slightly annoyed by your interrupting him, but understanding, he continued without scolding you. You may have looked older, but you were still his nephew for now. "Your first option is to have your reality to changed to be my gay lover. Your dad and I have known that you have been curious about guys like you have been about girls, which is completely normal for guys your age. Hell, it happened to me and your dad at the same time, which obviously led us toward two very different paths. With this option, your parents would no longer know you, you would assume a completely new identity, but only you and I will know the truth. Your second option is when you go back home, you will look the way you did before this accident, where no-one would be the wiser. Everything to them, even the bigger clothes you will be wearing, would look like the normal size to fit the old you, not the older new you. With the second option, in time, everyone would see you growing into how you look now, as if it were the way you progressively grew to look."</Br>
<Br>"Sounds like interesting options. What would happen to me with option one though? Would I automatically be gay, would you let me figure things out for myself toward my sexuality and what would I do outside of high-school?"</Br>
<Br>"You being my gay lover will just be a cover, that is unless you realize that you are gay. I wont use my magic to sway you one way or another. About what you'd do outside of high-school... well one option would be to work for me here, helping me run the store and what-not. Not to mention, you would be great company since I have lived alone for a very long time."</Br>
<Br>"Why have you lived alone Uncle Jack?"</Br>
<Br>"To be honest, I don't really know how people would react if they knew I could perform magic, not to mention what would happen if a boyfriend of mine came into the store and got turned into something completely different, possibly ruining what our relationship would be. With you, it is a little bit different, because your dad and I knew how much you wanted to get buff, not have any body fat, and be as masculine as you are now when you found that your old body didn't want to comply easily."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I guess you are right. This really is a blessing in disguise, but which option should I take. School has gotten boring to me lately, but I don't want to lose my friends."</Br>
<Br>"That isn't surprising to me in the least! You have always been a very bright kid even when you started being able to walk and talk. It is your choice though, so take your time and make your decision, because once it has been done, it is something like you wearing the costume after dawn and I cannot undo the reality changing spell."</Br>
<Br>You stand there, looking at both your reflections in the mirror, seeing both your pieces just dangling there, not really thinking much of it. Something in you didn't mind the two of you standing there exposed, especially since you weren't really "turned on" by it. With your mind made up, you look at him in the reflection with a slight smile on your face. "Alright Uncle Jack, I have made my decision! I choose..."</Br></p>
