<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He had always hated math the most. Mostly it was due to him being terrible at it, which would just get him more and more frustrated. It was way easier to just count laps as he swam in the pool than to learn algebra which he felt that he would never use in his life outside of school. So when Hildia mentioned they would begin with math, he froze in place. <br />
<br />
Noticing that she was no longer being followed, Hildia looked back to see Charlotte with a very nervous expression. &quot;Follow me&quot;. Was all she said, and left the room without looking back again. Having been given an order, Charlotte had to now comply or suffer through endless shockings until she did so. It wasn&#39;t hard catching back up though as Hildia had just left the room. <br />
<br />
As they walked to another room, Hildia started to criticize Charlotte&#39;s current capabilities in terms of academics. &quot;Honestly, I know middle schoolers who are better at this than you. I dont know if you are a lucky idiot or somehow planned for all of this, but your days of getting saved by the school staff are done. No daughter of mine will take that kind of handouts anymore. Honestly it is such an insult to the school to think that you are taking up a slot some other kid could benefit from having, just because you can swim faster than most. Well, maybe not anymore. Not with that hair or those muscles at least.&quot; Hildia smerked, knowing that since she had removed his only reason to be allowed in the school, meant that he had to pass his classes, or lose the rest of his full ride scholarship, and would have to pay the tuition fees. His 1.0 G.P.A. was already shit with a year and a half of being a straight D- student. He would be lucky if he could manage to double it by the end of his 4 year stay. And even with a 2.0, most places would never even think about hiring him. Not that she would let them even have the chance to reject him, as she already had different plans in store for her &quot;daughter&#39;s&quot; future. <br />
<br />
Oh yes, Hildia wasn&#39;t just doing this entirely all for fun. She had a reason behind all of her actions so far. That reason was that she had sensed a strong latent potential for magic in Charlie, but as he was a male, that power would likely go unnoticed for the rest of his entire life. Witches already were scarce as is. So seeing him, who has the magical potential that would nearly even rival her own, she just had to act. At least, before another witch found him and claimed him for herself. <br />
<br />
The room they entered looked like it formally was just a storage closet that had been hastily turned into a makeshift classroom for 1. There was a table with 2 chairs and some kind of writing board that seemed to be levitating in mid air near the back wall. A single ball of whitish blue flame was floating near the ceiling too. It was more than bright enough as upon entering, Charlotte had to block the light with his hand and squint. Hildia dimmed it down a bit as she too felt it was too bright. <br />
<br />
A loud clinking of metal chain could be heard as Charlotte ankle cuff&#39;s chain moved itself to now be anchored on to the wall of this room. It then slowly began retracting, pulling in Charlotte until he couldn&#39;t  move more than a few feet, it was just long enough to allow him to sit at the table comfortably.<br />
<br />
Charlotte took a seat in the chair and began twirling one of his fingers around a strand of his hair, nervously. Hildia closed the door behind her as she entered the room, taking the remaining open seat on the opposite end of the table for herself. She gave him a look and clicked her tongue. &quot;Cross one leg over the other when you sit down in a chair, Charlotte. Especially whenever you are wearing a dress or a skirt. If you do not, then everyone will have full view of your panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte tried to do as he was instructed. However the position was very uncomfortable for him as it put a lot of unwanted pressure on his dick and/or balls no matter how he tried to do it. Seeing him struggle, Hildia rolled her eyes and flicked her wrist in his direction. Suddenly it was bo longer uncomfortable to sit like how she wanted him to. But along with that, came a noticable absence between his legs, which paled his face. He hesitantly reached his hand down underneath his skirt in order to get a proper idea as to what just happened. But before he even got close, a shock ran through his entire body from the ankle cuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlotte! That is so not appropriate. Do not ever just start fingering yourself when in the presence of others. That is not how a lady behaves, and I will not allow my daughter to become some kind of exhibitionist&quot; ridiculed Hildia. Charlotte&#39;s shocking finally ended after about 15 seconds, leaving him gasping for air and sweating like crazy. Hildia then said in the same stern tone of voice, &quot;Now then, what do you have to say for yourself, young lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im sorry, Mama. I wasn&#39;t trying to finger myself, I promise. I was just curious as to what you did to me was all, I swear&quot; cried Charlotte, not wanting to ever be shocked for that long again. It was painful, and while it wasn&#39;t at a level of being dangerous, it was extremely unpleasant to go through reguarless. This latest shock had convinced Charlotte that he really had no control over anything anymore. Mama had everything, and she would likely not hesitate to do whatever she felt necessary in order to teach him, so the best way to get through this whole ordeal was probably to just do whatever the hell she said, and to never act on his own unless told to do so ever again. So he tossed away his remaining pride and begged her for forgiveness even though he knew that he was not guilty of the crime in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, is that so. Fine then. I will believe you this time. But do not ever let me catch you playing with yourself when you are not alone. Understand Charlotte?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mama. I understand and I will never do it, I promise.&quot; Hastily agreed Charlotte.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, you can do it when you want to if you are in privacy and such. Masturbating is normal, so I won&#39;t be mad at you for doing so if it is done so at an appropriate time and in an appropriate place. Such as in your bedroom whenever you have some free time in your schedule. Just do it in moderation, and not in public or with others whome you are not in that kind of a relationship with is all I am asking of you, ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlotte nods his head in agreement to which Hildia praises him for. &quot;Good girl&quot;. Hildia then turns to the board and a graph of information appears. On it were all kinds of formulas and mathematical concepts. Even some different looking ones that looked more made up than real, as oddly shapped symbols,  many of which Charlotte had never even seen before, were mixed into their equations. <br />
<br />
With another flick of her finger, the entire board of information thinned down into a long, flat line that was maybe half an inch wide and a thick as a sheet of paper. The board then moved towards him and began passing right into his forehead and through his skull as it was absorbed immediatly by the brain. <br />
<br />
The sudden influx of information and concepts made Charlotte nearly puke. Once the data was all moved to inside his head, Hildia made a new board appear, and wrote down even more information. This process repeated 6 more times. And by then, Charlotte had actually puked twice. But Hildia mearly cleaned it up instantly and continued on. This was the last board of information she could provide. As thisnwas everything she herself knew relating to mathematics in both the physical world and in magic. It was the 2 boards that were entirely magic based that had caused her daughter to puke, but she had fully expected her to do it, as it is what all witches go through when they are first starting out. She herself had actually even fainted from the mental load.<br />
<br />
Once the last board was fully absorbed, Hildia sat down once again at the table and stroked Charlotte head, which was now laying down on the table. &quot;How are you feeling? Is the nausea wearing off, or would you like me to help and remove it for you?&quot; Asked Hildia in a much more caring and softer tone. It actually sounded like she was a genuinely concerned parent for once. Charlotte nodded his head and she then pulled a white foggy substance from out of his body, which quickly dissipated into nothingness. Charlotte raised his head after than, feeling a lot better. &quot;Thanks, Mama.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I do not enjoy watching my daughter be in such a miserable state, and I will always help you whenever you need me to. All I ask of you is that you be a good girl and simply follow my instructions. If you can promise me that, then we can talk about eventually removing that ankle cuff. What do you say, deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Mama. I promise to be a good girl&quot; agreed Charlotte. She was no longer interested in fighting against Hildia, and felt that by just submitting to her would be her best option at this point. Even if that meant throwing away the rest of her masculinity and former identity in the process, she no longer cared. She would agree to anything that would get this nightmare over with sooner.</p>
