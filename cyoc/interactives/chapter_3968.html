<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Good Bye dear, yelled Karissa as she walked out the front door of their third floor flat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitch heard her leave but was still rather taken by his new equipment. The long stiffening rod soon hung out straight and tight. Mitch a true man tried to put one hand around the glands but fingers never touched his palm.<br />
<br />
A slow stroke downward of his palm made the new member jump to a tense feeling as his balls began to ache for release. Looking around Mitch saw some of Karissa's hand cream and shooting a palm full he creamed the huge member from end to bottom. Enterlaceing his fingers he began to stroke the massive piece of flesh. After only seven sensual passes the balls churned and a strange feeling of a clog coming down the length of his cock.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a thick conjealing mass shot out a suck on the mirror. More and then more spewed forth splattering the mirror, sink, and counter. Never had he ever had such a surge or extreme pleasure. Closing his eyes for an instant replay he stroked the cock again.<br />
<br />
A shiver ran from his head to toes as he again spewed a load this time covering the bathroom window and curtains. As he looked over the new mess the color of the semen had turned a greenish yellow. A pungent odor touched his nose as he began to sniff the globs clinging everywhere.<br />
<br />
At first the odor was rather nasty but the second load had a sweet smell that tantalized his senses. Sniffing ever closer he could nolonger hold himself back and began licking the now crusty glob from mirror, window, and curtains.<br />
<br />
Leaning on the toilet rim he let the member swing free and closing his eyes imagined how it would be standing free of all in a pasture. Time slipped away and as the phone rang he jumped awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;You comin' to work sleepy head, called his manager at the job sight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh George, I'm sick as Hell, got one damn big....., I don't think I should come in today, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
That settled that as senses returned and Mitch walked bow legged back to the bathroom. Licking him lips as he viewed the mess he made and then a thought of his enjoying the consumming of his strange new semen. As he looked into the mirror to check on the slime sticking to his teeth the sight of big buckey teeth loomed at him.<br />
<br />
Worse yet his nose had buldged out and merged with his upper lip. A hand came up and rubbed the soft but thick lips. The morning was young and in only an hour he had gained a new cock and lost his human face. The notice of his growing muzzel seemed more casual as he blinked sever times while his thoughts drained and he stood quiet and stupid for several minutes.<br />
<br />
As he glanced up the sight of two foot long furry ears brought his mind awake. Not believing his eyes he shook his head and watched the ears wave and move with his head. Now he had both muzzel and ears of a.......?<br />
<br />
Try as he could the answer to his mental question could not be forced to show it's angry head. Shaking his head seemed best to clear his thoughts. &quot;ASS, those ears look like ears of a big dumb Ass, he thought to himself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed the ears, muzzel, eyes, and total head looked like it should be hung on some dumb Ass in a zoo. &quot;HEAD!&quot; Mitch looked the mirror over and his entire head was now total that of the beast. Reaching his left hand up to rub his broad nostril, a dark horney hoof touched the feeler hairs. <br />
<br />
As looked down what was arms now sported thickening sandy brown and gray fur, black skin, and dark brown hoofs. His chest and slowly his ribs barreled out to look quite euqine. As he stood beginning to admire his strong and rather handsome appearance he felt something sweeping his buttocks.<br />
<br />
A easy look over his lengthening furry back saw the happy tail swinging as he had sensual thoughts. Feeling ever so much delighted by the new arangements Mitch settled back to masterbating his cock in the mirror. Each swing of the heavy member brought an easing feeling and his horror of the original findings was long gone.<br />
<br />
A shiver and a wiggle of his exploding butt made him spread his hind leg's stance. Chills and more chills wriggled down his frame as the final touches of Donkeydom brought on the new you!<br />
<br />
All thought process stopped and Mitch stood content to stand with forehoofs on the bathroom counter, hind legs planted on the shower rug, and his head bobbed as a giant cock swung a masterbated delight. A Donkey mind has only time to waste since it hasn't got much for a mind. Morning slipped by and the Donkey felt a deep lust to satify a need to eat, and eat, and eat.<br />
<br />
Mitch was still crafty in thought even if his brain and mental abilities had degraded to almost a stupid dumb Ass.  Using his buck teeth to turn the latch on the apartment's front door he plodded into the carpeted hall. Pushing the down button like he had done a thousand times before offered a easy exit from the building.<br />
<br />
As the elevator stopped for a passenger on the second floor Mitch wondered why the woman screamed for help as the doors closed. At last the doors opened to the first floor. A terrarium offered a neat place for his lunch as he stood eating everything green in sight.<br />
<br />
Calm and content as people pointed and looked at the big beast grazing in the apartment building's inner park. Mitch felt at ease when some nice smelling men slipped a halter over his head and the three walked out front to a waiting stock truck.</p>
