<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The second day of checking was done mostly as a just in case. Some things happened and had obviously changed things. Some of it was a surprise. Most of Jen&#39;s past jobs had been in landscaping, minor administrative, and even some more &quot;low level&quot; jobs, mainly due to the fact that her family constantly moving due to Jeff&#39;s career and being moved from posting to posting. She&#39;d only considered going back to college to fill the requirements for a medical career shortly after Tad was born. It was through an online program and made the on the job training sessions worse, as many major hospitals didn&#39;t work well with students doing their academics online, but Jen managed and it earned her the proper certification for nursing.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s career and changing deployments and postings generally meant that Jen had to stick to not only nursing but a general practitioner&#39;s nurse. Training for those spots wouldn&#39;t take long and because of this, when the Decker family moved due to Jeff&#39;s postings, the hospitals and clinics that Jen had worked for wouldn&#39;t lose much when Jen moved with Jeff to the next base. It was also why she&#39;d often worked in positions that were in landscaping, minor administrative, and even some more &quot;low level&quot; jobs, but then, with Tad and herself on her own, it wasn&#39;t likely that she&#39;d be leaving Moon Lake any time soon. Perhaps she could try again for a nursing position, but she would also apply for the other positions as well. The job market was tight enough that she really couldn&#39;t put all her eggs in one basket.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, Jen took down her list, her edited resumes, and all the confidence she could muster and made her way out.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
“I still don’t get why we have to stay here?” Dymixious grumbled as he paced the motel room that he and his wife had been given.<br />
<br />
The “visit” to Moon Lake had been far from what he had planned. He had hoped that he would be able to cash in on the agreement his father had made with the Tachibana family in Japan with the hope that they would render all issues regarding treatment and even payment moot. It never occurred to him that the US wouldn’t accept or recognize Akane’s relations to a Japanese noble house when she immigrated to the US with her family. But while Akane’s son, Tora Tachibana, had secured treatment for Jade’s pregnancy, it was not the way Dymixious had planned and he wasn’t treated with the sort of respect that he had expected.<br />
<br />
The worst of it to Dymixious was that he was told that he and his wife weren’t to leave Moon Lake and would have to stay in a lone motel and one that wasn’t exactly a five star establishment. Jade deserved that and he figured that by keeping weres safe that he deserved that. That left him pacing the room wondering why the Skulk wasn’t treating him with the respect he felt he deserved.<br />
<br />
“Keeping us here is one thing, but the least they could do is give us a better hotel… if not guest space,” Dymixious grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps your tales of friendship are not as rosy as you have told them,” Jade commented, “but then… this is a rather small town. It’s likely this hotel was put in for those going between the US and Canada and the occasional traveler to Seattle who can go no farther. Do you really expect them to put a major hotel chain here? Particularly if most of the town’s population are weres?”<br />
<br />
Dymixious gave a shrug and sighed, “Maybe not… but then why not offer us a room in Akane’s home? There is only two of us and we can stay out of the way.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps she’s busy with some other task,” Jade answered, “and besides it isn’t that bad.”<br />
<br />
Jade stood up and walked over to her husband and softly rubbed his shoulders from behind.<br />
<br />
“We are together and from what you’ve told me, we should be safe from discovery with Ulysses dead,” Jade said to him, “and since I’m presently on maternity leave with our new arrival being soon and you having no odd jobs for the moment… we have the opportunity to relax and simply enjoy things. That isn’t bad, is it?”<br />
<br />
“That isn’t bad,” Dymixious commented, “but I was hoping for a bit more gratitude.”<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
“This is all confusing Mrs. Tachibana,” Moon Lake’s police chief, Chief O’Hara, said slowly with steady eyes, “you say this man is the one who killed Lionel Ulysses?”<br />
<br />
“In his own efforts to preserve were secrecy,” Akane Tachibana said slowly to the police chief, “I thought it best to inform you on the issue to make sure that he doesn’t cause any trouble. Or at least any more trouble.”<br />
<br />
“You do realize that if the police or the FBI figure out that this man did commit the crime and that he is here… they could send units here to catch him, which could have the potential to further expose us,” Chief O’Hara warned with a very stern face.<br />
<br />
He’d never thought that the elderly werefox would take such a risk, but figured that there had to be some reason for her decision.<br />
<br />
“I do realize the risks… but they would also be there if he weren’t here and weren’t in an area where he can be protected from the worst of his being caught… should that happen,” Akane answered, “Especially since I’ve LONG held the opinion that Dymixious, like his father, will not be above to using violence and potentially killing large numbers if it means protecting were secrecy.”<br />
<br />
That made the Moon Lake Police Chief focus intently with narrowed eyes, “He’d…?”<br />
<br />
“If he thinks he has to protect our secret, he will do whatever he thinks is the most expedient, even if it isn’t the smartest decision, as the actions taken with regard to Ulysses have already demonstrated,” Akane nodded, “and if it weren’t for that… not to mention that his wife is innocent, to my knowledge, of his actions… I would not be above urging him to turn himself in and let the law handle it, as his expectations of what he would get from me would fit in a feudal monarchy… but not in Moon Lake where I don’t wield that sort of political power.”<br />
<br />
Chief O’Hara could only rub his temples as he could feel a headache coming on. The Harper/Jenkins wedding was approaching at the end of the week and there was a lot of potential trouble that would go along with that, and Moon Lake could really stand to have as few complications as possible. The hunt for Lionel Ulysses and then the threat of exposure due to his arrest and then murder had only raised the potential for trouble coming to Moon Lake. Now learning that the murder was a were, was in Moon Lake, and was of a violent enough temperament to risk further exposure to weres only served to make things even more dangerous. If the Seattle Police or the FBI track Dymixious down, there would be more hoops to jump through and further risks that might come about. It’d mean he’d have to pull some more long nights just to have things in order to make sure that things were in order to protect Moon Lake’s secret. It was a confusing situation, but nothing could change that situation now.</p>
