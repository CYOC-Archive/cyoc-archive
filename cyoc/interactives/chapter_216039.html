<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad woke up slowly and with a groan. It had been a strange dream. He had dreamed that he&#39;d been transformed into a gorilla. A female gorilla, even. Ridiculous. But so vivid. Luckily, that awful dream was over. The sunshine indicated that blissfully morning was there. He was in his bed, in his mattress of green leaves and lush rainforest room, so green and pleasantly hot and warm, with its earthy smell... Wait, what???!!! Chad rose up. On all fours. He went around what was clearly a zoo enclosure, panicked. No! No, no, no! This couldn&#39;t be real! But he pinched himself and looked at himself and he was forced to admit reality. It was no dream! He was a female gorilla! Just above mating age and with a vulva. Definitely a vulva, as repulsive as the sight was. Just because of that jerk Damian! Chad hit the two glass walls but not only no one came but these damn things were solid. He could only drink a bit and munch on the roots and fruits left around for his breakfast. His calls went unheard, lost in the cries of the other zoo animals. But he did notice several rows of chairs beyond on glass walls, facing his cage. This intrigued him. Why were they here?<br />
But as noon went past, these chairs got filled. Chad tried to catch the people&#39;s attention but they just took notes, shot him glances or plain ignored him to talk to their neighbors. How rude! He was no dumb ape and he was trying to tell them that information of utmost importance! And they ignored him and treated him like a stupid animal! And worse, amongst all the people, he noticed Damian coming and sitting in the first row, with a shit-eating grin on his face. Chad snarled and glared but apart from Damian, no one seemed to notice. But the thick glass and the cage stopped Chad from acting out any sort of violent revenge that he would have given anything to enact. Anything to see that smirk disappear from his face!          <br />
<br />
Damian was overjoyed. It had been easy to create a fake ID to come assist to the show. Well, show for him. A scene of animal mating behaviour for the rest of vet students and specialists filling the chairs. It would start soon and if Chad was agitated, he had perfectly recognised Damian. Better yet, the former stupid bully had no idea of what was going to happen! As for the rest of the researchers and vets, well, they assumed that the new female and precious gorilla addition to the show was just a bit confused and discombobulated. No matter. She&#39;d soon enough meet another of her kind and things would go better. All were conversing and after a while, the main vet of the zoo stepped in front ands on the side of the cage. Damian smiled like all the others, but it was an evil smile. Yes, the show was about to start and he didn&#39;t want to miss a second of it.<br />
&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome! Here is Chad, our new addition to the gorilla exhibit. Her name is merely misleading, rest assured. She is very female and it only indicates her country of origin. She isa quite young but has reached sexual maturity recently. She is fully formed and mature to become a mother. Accessorily to joining a troupe of gorillas led by a male silverback. She&#39;ll feel much better once she had a companion for gorillas, like humans, are highly social animals. Luckily for Chad, we have one extra male at this zoo and as he cannot fight the leader of the harem we already have, he will be introduced to Chad so as to start his very own harem of females. Maestro&#39;s a big boy and he will greatly benefit from such a tender young lady! He&#39;ll be let in at any moment now!&quot;<br />
Chad was of course listening and as he could understand everything. Wait... They were letting in who? To do what? What did gorillas do that they talked about? Chad was never the type to stay focused during academic or even serious talks and here, this lack of interest and focus was not to his advantage at all. He understood better when a door was opened and in stepped in a huge gorilla. A male gorilla. Doubtlessly &quot;Maestro&quot; and Chad backed away, very nervous, as the huge ape sniffed the air. Then his eyes fell on Chad appreciatively. His eyes shone with pleasure and lust and he approached slowly. If he could have had the biggest grin on his face, he would have, no doubt about it. Chad could smell the wave of testosterone emanating from the big creature and it his him like a wall. Worse, his body seemed to completely betray him and acted out of its own accord. It responded by letting his new vulva and vagina swell exponentially and start dripping cum and sweat profusely while pumping out new pheromones in the air as an answer. No! Stop! Don&#39;t excite that dumb creature more! Maestro&#39;s stare fell on Chad&#39;d leaking pussy and he grunted appreciatively. His virility was already starting to have effect, apparently! Panicked at his body deciding to act like a female in heat in spite of his brain and pride&#39;s screams, Chad tried to stop the horrible display of his crotch occurring but coving himself with his hand. But the flow of bodily fluids was just too important and it leaked between his fingers. Yuck! Even worse, his pressing just resulted in a pressing and rubbing of his hands, therefore a mention that excited his vulva and clitoris even more. This masturbation engorged his vulva, labia and clitoris with blood, displaying his desire even more to Maestro. The muscles of his vagina clenched and squeezed in anticipation, but soon became frustrated at having nothing to squeeze around and no gorilla penis to hug lovingly and tightly. Chad could feel the blood pumping into his boobs snd buttocks, making them round, bouncy and attractive. He was really becoming the picture of a female lusting after her mate! No! As for Maestro, he could not get enough of this spectacle and his penis got hard fast. hat was the only good news because Chad saw that the thing was only three cm long. It was tiny! Puny! Did Maestro have a problem? Well, at least, it was better than the opposite. Chad did not know that it was absolutely normal for gorillas and that the males re.lied on their bodies to respect their ownership over a harem. A penis was good to urinate and make babies. Only simple-minded males could believe that size meant anything other than size itself. And this adorable cutie was going to be the first. She couldn&#39;t resist, he could see itb plainly. Oh, he would make all her dreams of motherhood, pleasure and companionship come true. A little nervous, yes, but she would soon come to appreciate him. Yes.<br />
Unbeknownst to Chad, Maestro was in fact a former victim of Damian. He had transformed a big bully in another high school into a gorilla. A male gorilla, so that he would shut up about the size of his dick. And soon, the bully had come to realize that he could not have his own harem as another powerful male kept all the females. Overcome by new instincts and frustrations, he had started to swear that hew would treat all and any of his females with pleasure and respect, loving the notions to have babies, even daughters. Quite a change from the misogynist hating the prospect of having daughters and taking any &quot;nonsense&quot; from a wife! And Damian was pleased at the show both provided, while the others scribbled notes.<br />
Maestro, for one, was elated. Finally! A pretty little thing just for him! And what a darling she was! Expectant and not insensitive to his charms, clearly! Perfect! He would be attentive and sweet and give her needs the attention they required. She would be satisfied and spoiled, the little nervous beauty. At first she tried to defend herself but her muscles were not match for him. His brain recalled dimly his human habits, from long, long ago, too long to remember, it seemed and he kissed her neck, cheek and playfully spanked her a little. His gropes became caresses and he tickled her and patted her cheek. She&#39;d relax and know that he knew what he was doing. He rubbed her labia which became flush with lust and when he penetrated her, he was received with all due honors. His virile member was hugged lovingly and he came more than once, drenching her in seed and pleasure. He grunted, promising her a life of domestic bliss. It was true that Chad&#39;s brain was now a passenger, overcome by new desires and tastes. The pleasure was great! He would have twins after that! Perfect, having two cute babies would cement their life together. And he would take good, good cate of her, she knew it. She&#39;d be a dutiful mate and he&#39;d make her know she was his precious wife. They&#39;d embrace among leaves and he;&#39;d groom her and he&#39;d give her treats of berries and fruits and sugar cane and he&#39;d be an excellent father. He loved her fully already!<br />
<br />
That night, as everyone was gone, Chad was hit by shame but he could not refrain from feeling exhausted yet incredibly happy. Maestro was by his side. All was right. She had food and a baby in the making. The cage was so, so comfortable. And Maestro so attentive! What a gentleman. His personality as a mean human male was receding already and Chad was too preoccupied with the domestic bliss of his new life to care. He was powerless in letting the sad person he had been being replaced by a much better, kinder, female gorilla. If ever more transformed females arrived, he&#39;d make them feel accustomed to this new careless existence. Maestro pecked her on the cheek and brought her breakfast in bed every morning, patting her belly in loving expectation and tickling her mercilessly if she was naughty. He knew how to satisfy her and render her happy at being his perfect mate. As for Damian, he was already wondering at how to make these two lovebirds&#39; family life more complete. They had changed so much and become such better creatures, did they not deserve it?</p>
