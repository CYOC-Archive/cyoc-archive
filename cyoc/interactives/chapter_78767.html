<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jae got home from boarding with James he crashed, it had been a long day.  The next morning, before heading out to class, he went to his PC to check his email.  Patrick (one of Jace's friends) had agreed to proofread a paper for Jae in exchange for protection from bullies.  Jae read the email that said Patrick was staying home sick but asked if Jae wouldn't mind turning his paper as well.  He fired off a quick reply to Patrick thanking him and then set things to print while he went off to shower and jackoff.  What Jae hadn't noticed was that The Maker program had not only downloaded some updates, but also attached itself to the email to Patrick.  After showering Jae quickly grabbed the papers and his board and headed to class.<br />
<br />
*******************************************************<br />
Patrick wasn't really sick but had decided to skip class because he needed a break from all the bullying.  While he sat gaming, he noticed he had a new email from Jae:<br />
&quot;Thanks for the proofread dude.  Dont worry bout the bullies...no one will bother you anymore.  Get well bud!<br />
Jae&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick noticed that there was an attachment to the email, which was unusual.  After downloading the program, he opened it and was surprised to see what looked like a SIMS/Second Life type program.  He never thought of Jae as the gamer type since he was a smart, on the soccer team and spent his spare time either skateboarding or surfing.  Patrick decided it might be cool to try the game out.  Maybe he could use it as another way to escape from his problems.<br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was that the program had all of his info in it:<br />
Name: Patrick Huntington<br />
Age: 17<br />
Height: 6'3<br />
Weight: 140<br />
Body type: lanky<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Hair Color: Dark Brown<br />
Eye Color: Blue<br />
Sexuality: Straight<br />
Interests: History, Math, Gaming, anime, manga<br />
<br />
Patrick had always looked up to Jae.  Jae had always been kind to him since they were young, and while, they weren't friends, treated him with respect.  As a result and because he wanted to honor Jae, he decided to make his character like Jae so he changed some of the info, thinking if it really bothered Jae, he could always go back and change things.<br />
<br />
Body type: Athletic/Muscular<br />
Race: Asian<br />
Hair Color: Black<br />
Eye color: Brown<br />
Sexuality: Bi<br />
Interests: Soccer, Skateboarding, surfing, weight-training, rugby, anime, manga<br />
<br />
He really wasn't sure what to do about weight or height so he just left them.  As Patrick was about to click save he noticed he had the options of keeping his own memory or adapting to the new identity. He had no idea what any of this meant but clicked &quot;adapt to new identity.&quot;  He then clicked save.  It felt like a surge of electricity went through his body and he lept out of his seat.  As he shook the feeling off, his body started to feel weird and he noticed in his mirror that changes were happening.<br />
<br />
At first he thought something was wrong with the mirror because it looked like he was shrinking and in fact Patrick had lost 3 inches to be 6'0.  His shoes got tight as a feet grew from a size 8 to a size 11, busting out of the sneakers he had been wearing.  He then stared in amazement as the growth continued up his legs.  His calves strengthened, developing the musculature that came from playing soccer, boarding and surfing.  As this happened, he watched his calves inflate as well, doubling in size and ripping his shorts and boxers up the sides.  He then felt something akin to arousal and his hand made its way down his shorts as he felt his cock increase from 5 inches to 12 and balls doubled in size as well.  At the same time, his ass grew into a perfect bubble.  <br />
<br />
While his waist remained the same size, he watched as his torso thickened with muscles, each of his abs popping out in pairs until he had an 8 pack.  He watched as his pecs grew until he could barely see over them.  As all this happened he forearms thickened with muscle and his biceps grew to 24 inches.  As his neck thickened with muscle and delts grew more muscular, Patrick continued to stroke his cock with one hand while making a muscle in the other.  He then felt his face changing, becoming more angular and saw his eyes take on an almond shape, turning chestnut brown.  At the same time, his skin was changing from pasty white to a golden brown.  The last thing to change was his hair.  Almost all his body hair disappeared except for his pubes and a light treasure trail.  The hair on his head turned jet black and then went from a side part to a style similar to what you would see in anime or manga.<br />
<br />
While thinking that the jolt he had received was making him hallucinate, he felt a pressure in his head.  His mind was rewriting itself to reflect his his new life, filling with knowledge of soccer, boarding and surfing.  It was then that everything around him seemed to phase out of reality for a minute.  At the same time as the personality of Patrick Huntington emptied itself into his testicles, the personality of Park Ha-Woo took over.  Park Ha-Woo was a 2nd generation Korean American.  As he climaxed, the last of Patrick Huntington disappeared.<br />
<br />
Checking himself out in the mirror...Park knew how hot he was.  He glanced at the clock and realized, that even though he could go another round, he would be late for school and he couldn't afford to miss a practice.  Besides after he was supposed to go boarding with his best bud Jae.  He quickly finished getting dressed putting on his CK jeans and a skin tight striped polo.  He finished the outfit with a black belt that had large skull buckle.  He then grabbed his ipod and put his chain bracelet on.  Before heading out the door, he couldn't resist pulling up his shirt, flexing his arm and snapping photo.  He quickly sent it to Jae, hoping that it would entice him to a quickie either before class or during their free period.  He then grabbed his board and ran out the door to head to school.</p>
