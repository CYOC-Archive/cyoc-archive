<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody saw two black haired women walking on the same aisle as him, they seemed Asian, East Asian more specifically. One of the women was the same height as Cody: 5&#39;8&quot;. She had some hair bangs on her face, and her hair just got halfway through the back of her neck. The woman was skinny, not as voluptuous as the woman walking next to her, in fact, she looked younger than the other woman. &quot;Probably because they&#39;re mother and daughter&quot; thought Cody, since their faces looked alike. The young girl was wearing a denim jacket and a plain white shirt underneath, along with blue jeans.<br />
<br />
Her mother was taller, at 6&#39;2&quot;. Her hair was much longer and smooth, barely touching the middle of her back, and although she looked young, some wrinkles in her face revealed her age. In a sense, she was chubbier than her daughter, with thicker legs and arms, and a rounder face. The adult woman had some E-cup breasts, which were bigger than her daughter&#39;s, who had a pair of B-cups. The mom was wearing a long sleeve light blue shirt with and black leggings.<br />
<br />
Cody chose the two gals as his subjects, and he decided to transform them both into men, but reversing her ages. For the mom, Cody configured the control to transform her into a 16-year old fat boy, and her daughter into a 40-year old man. While the young girl was looking at her phone and the mother was analyzing the shelves, Cody pressed the button and the transformation began.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else before them, they felt a slight pain on their backs. Cody saw them turning around so he quickly acted as if he was looking for something on the shelf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kristen,&quot; said the mother, &quot;did you... feel something hitting you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. That&#39;s weird, to say the least. Do you think it was that guy over there? I mean, he&#39;s the only one behind us.&quot; Cody could hear the girl talking, and that was probably on purpose, since she wanted to see Cody&#39;s reaction to her comments, but her mother rejected her accusations. &quot;Don&#39;t say that aloud, KristEn! Let&#39;s get-&quot; the woman stopped talking. She thought something was different with her voice, like if it broke when she said her daughter&#39;s name. She coughed, checking if something was in her throat, but she didn&#39;t feel anything wrong there.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you saying, mom?&quot; asked Kristen, whose voice was getting deeper, but, unlike her mother, Kristen didn&#39;t seem to notice. &quot;It&#39;s jUst... somethIng&#39;s Up with mY vOIce!&quot; said her mom. Kristen could hear her mother&#39;s voice cracking more and more, and... was her mom also getting shorter? Not only that, she was way beyond &quot;just chubby&quot; now, she was getting fatter. Her long sleeve shirt, although slightly loose due to it remaining adult-sized, got tighter in her arms, which were gaining lard, as well as her legs. Her leggins, instead of showing up her butt, now highlighted her fat waist and began to rip.<br />
<br />
On the other side, Kristen noticed she was getting taller, even more than her mom. At the same time she grew taller, she also gained muscle instead of the fat that gained her mom. This presented a problem for her clothes too. The jeans were now skintight, showcasing her new round butt. The white shirt was getting far too uncomfortable for her, so she decided to take off her jacket and rip the shirt with a newfound strength, revealing a white sports bra on a plain chest, which finally let Kristen know that her breasts shrank and now pecs were forming.<br />
<br />
Kristen began to remove her bra, not really thinking if anyone else was watching, all that mattered was that those bras were bothering her a lot. She felt itchy, but in the areas where she scratched, hair began to appear, from her belly to her chest, even in her back and armpits. It wasn&#39;t a lot of hair, but it horrified Kristen. &quot;What the fuck is happening?!&quot; she said, and, just like her mom, she knew her voice was different, manlier. She grabbed her throat and noticed something growing: an Adam&#39;s apple. She could also feel a bit of hair there, but it got thicker upwards on her chin which was now getting covered in facial hair. <br />
<br />
It was a really weird seen Kristen&#39;s cute face covered in hair, but her features got more masculine as well. Her skin wasn&#39;t as smooth anymore, it was rough, and her cheekbones began to stand out. She did get a new haircut, eliminating her bangs and any hair on the sides or back, leaving the top of her head with shorter hair than before.<br />
<br />
Kristen&#39;s mom had also changed drastically along with her daughter. She lost height but gained weight. She pulled her shirt up to check her growing belly and saw stretchmarks and a new pair of moobs that made her bra snap. Although her hair remained long, it got greasy, just like her face. And regarding her face, all the wrinkles disappeared, making her much younger than before. Her cheeks got fatter, her lips meatier, and a double chin had also appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think now I&#39;m older than you, so maybe I should start calling you Natalie instead of mom&quot; remarked Kristen to her mother, which wasn&#39;t very amused. &quot;Kristen, this is not the time for jokes!&quot; Natalie&#39;s voice sounded even younger than before and it still cracked, but Natalie didn&#39;t care right now.<br />
<br />
The two...women? now looked vastly different than before. Natalie&#39;s beauty mark on the bottom right corner of her lip and her necklace were the things that hinted at her original appearance, but Kristen had nothing aside from her jeans.<br />
<br />
Then they felt something between her legs, almost pleasuring. Their female organs were getting replaced by new male ones. Natalie&#39;s dick and testicles didn&#39;t grow that much, Kristen on the other hand got an eight-inch dick with her testicles. Their underwear gave up and tore apart. <br />
<br />
The sudden sensations awakened by their new organs brought with it the desire the touch their new penises. It was easy for Kristen to hold back such desire, but Natalie couldn&#39;t, and after grabbing his new genitals, a stain showed on the crotch section of his leggings. Cody knew far too well what caused that stain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, you did it again!&quot; groaned Kristen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Natalie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... your crotch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Natalie.<br />
<br />
The transformation of the two women had finished. Even after their ages were reversed and Kristen looked like Natalie&#39;s dad, they still acted like mother and daughter. &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone would notice, Kris&quot; said Natalie, now Nate, nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they will!&quot; said Kris, &quot;Gosh, why are you so calm about it?&quot; His attitude was still like that of the original Kristen, which was weird for a man his age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you&#39;re one to talk.&quot; said Nate. &quot;You&#39;re going around the store shirtless, dude.&quot; Now, Nate was beginning to speak like Cody&#39;s mom, Jace, after the transformation.<br />
<br />
Kris ignored his comment and moved on to check his phone, while Nate waddled along the aisle, due to the fat of his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another amazing job&quot; thought Cody. &quot;Let&#39;s buy the stuff I need and go home, I&#39;m feeling tired.&quot;</p>
