<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Dude, I’m going next,” Matt announced as he rolled the dice.  A two and a three appeared.  Matt moved up to a green square, and took a green card.  “Get better aquatinted with your pet.”  He looked puzzled for a minute.  Matt’s only pet was a 6-foot python.  Matt reached up and scratched an itch on his head, as he pulled his hand away, he saw it was full of his hair.  Matt grabbed his scalp with both hands, and realized he was pushing away his hair, and the scalp underneath felt smooth and scalley, just like his snake.  It only took a second for the scales to flow down to his neck, and start coming down his forehead.  Now all his hair had fallen, save a few strays.  His ears were disappearing into nothing, and as the scales traveled up his jaw it grew out, like a snake’s muzzle. Matt opened his mouth to reveal a new set of fangs, and no other teeth.  Without realizing it, his now forked tongue flashed out.  As the scales reached his eyes, he squinted shut, then, his eyelids turned clear, they became the snake’s protective scales, he could no longer blink, but he didn’t need to.  <br />
<br />
By now, from his neck up, Matt resembled a human sized snake-man hybrid.  He ran his hands over his new skin and felt as it continued running down his neck and back, the black wave following his spine down the center, into his shorts.  Once he realized this, Matt stripped down, showing that he was as well endowed below the belt, as his physique above the belt.  His shoulders began to turn scalley, and it started down his pecks.  As it reached his arms, they were pulled rigidly to his sides, as though he were a doll in the hand of some invisible giant.  The snakeskin smoothed over the seam between arm and chest, but his chiseled physique remained, with his strong shoulders, biceps, and chest still just as well defined as before, even the shape where his nipples were was plainly visible under the scales.  Although he could still move his hands and fingers, he gave up and held them to his sides, awaiting the onrush of the black wave.  <br />
<br />
As snakeskin crept down his happy trail, it seemed to uproot the hair, and send it flying away.  Matt watched nervously as the skin on his un-circumcised cock and balls became the same reptilian black as the rest.  He hardly realized, that he’d lost his butt crack.  The new skin that followed his spine down didn’t stop there, and it started pulling his legs together.  He realized his lower arms and hands were just about melting into his body, even though his upper arms, chest and shoulders remained well defined.  His genitals started pulling into the crack that existed between his legs, as skin grew towards them.  Matt recognized this as the ‘vent’ of a male snake.  From there, he could no longer stand, and fell over backwards on the couch behind him, as his legs fused past the ankles, and became completely engulfed in his new skin.  Where his legs had been, became smoothed over, and continued to increase in length, offering no signs that it was ever two distinct limbs.  Finally, the black python stopped growing at about twelve feet, with a sexy point to the end of his tail.  <br />
<br />
Doug reached over and touched Matt’s shoulder.  “Wow, that feels awesome”<br />
“You like it?  Smooth, just like my python.” asked Matt, sounding just like he always did, without any extra hiss.  He slinked off the couch, and slithered across the floor.  “This is easy.”  From the end, there was about eight feet of thick python, before the area where Matt’s waist used to be, and from there he kept his torso and head upright when moving around.  He played around for a while in his new body.  It seemed that his entire rib cage, and shoulder bones remained, along with upper arm bones.  Somewhere at the lower back, the skeleton changed to a pure snake form.  From there down, he had all the flexibility and strength of a snake and could curl up, or extend himself up in the air.  He found the new rectum near the end of the tail.  Matt was frustrated that he couldn’t get at his vent.<br />
<br />
“Alex, keep playing with yourself, I need to get a hard on.”  Alex realized, he still had a few fingers exploring around his vagina, and his other hand was gently massaging his D cups.  All of which kept his dick excited. <br />
“Come over here and help.  If you’re really bi, this is probably about as Bi as you can get.” Invited Alex, who, at this point, really didn’t see anything wrong with messing around with a 12 foot man python.  <br />
<br />
Matt slithered over, as Alex lay on his back, spread eagle.  Matt stuck his nose right into Alex’s pussy, and deftly flicked his tongue.  “YEOOO” Screamed Alex.  <br />
“Found your clitoris” announced Matt.  The other two laughing as well.  Matt slithered up further, to tongue the creamy breasts, when he realized his dick was poking out.  He aimed squarely for Alex’s wet pussy, and penetrated.  Alex moaned in pleasure and pain from simultaneously experiencing a ‘ribbed for pleasure’ scaly snake penis, having Matt’s belly scales massage his own dick, and Matt’s magical tongue play his boobs like classical instruments.  It wasn’t long before Alex orgasmed from both orifices, and Matt shot snake cum into his vagina.  <br />
<br />
Matt slinked back over to the other couch, and curled up contentedly.  Alex walked naked back to his room for a pack of cigarettes, playing with his bouncing boobs the whole way.</p>
