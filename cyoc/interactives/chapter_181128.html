<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley looked to this girl sitting in her little pink car. Her face was really pretty and her skin was tanned and flawless and blond hair with a nice blond shade of hair framing her face. Even though it was pretty early in the morning still her hair and make up looked nicely done around her eyes with a shade of lipstick that looked almost natural. Her hair looked pretty long with her bangs being clipped back. She was wearing a pair of skinny jeans and a white cap sleeves shirt and a bit of ruffle around its edges. She also had on a few small gold earrings with a few bracelets. Body wise she looked like she could be Ashley&#39;s body double the only difference is while Ashley had a modest b-cup bust this girl had Cs or maybe Ds? Ashley didnt know cups to well but this girls boobs were as big as possible without looking fake. This girl was super hot but oddly it felt weird to see her. She wasn&#39;t being turned on as much as feeling a bit of insecurity and envy looking her over. Ashley was a hot girl sure, but maybe she leaned more on the cute side while this girl was more on the sexy based on her figure and face features. Wait what was she thinking? Ashley considered for a moment before the girl spoke again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley. Get IN&quot; she said putting a bit of emphasis on it again as she snapped her hand at Ashley who was standing there just staring at her. Ashley stopped checking this girl out for a moment looking to the girl&#39;s blue eyes before they were covered again by the shiny surfaces of the girl&#39;s sunglasses. Ashley wasn&#39;t just about to do what some random teenage girl snapped at her, but oddly she felt weird. It was like not listening to this girl was making her extremely anxious and nervous. She hesitated for another moment before getting into the car and asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-who are you?.... w-what the hell is all of this?&quot; Ashley said seeming to not get a break this morning having all these assertive women in her face since getting up. The second the door of the car was closed the girl started to speed away making Ashley quickly put on her seatbelt.<br />
<br />
They were silent for a moment before they pulled into a coffee shop drive through and the girl ordered two mocha soi lattes with a million alterations before pulling up to the window and handing the cute boy working the window her ID. The boy handed back her card after a moment and then she looked to Ashley eyeing her over with a smirk as they got their order ready. Ashley squirmed in the seat feeling really uneasy now at this girls predatorial look. She would then suddenly ask<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me your belly button.&quot; out of nowhere. This made Ashley cock her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?!&quot; she simply snapped back before the girl said again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me your belly button.&quot; her expression unchanged. Ashley started to feel anxious again.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no...&quot; she said coving her tone tummy with her hands turning a bit red with blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me your belly button.&quot; she said again and the anxiety inside of Ashley seemed to grow more and she got more intimidated of this girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-&quot; she started weakly before being cut off again by the girl going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me your belly button.&quot; she said again before Ashley paused feeling her heart rate pick up before she finally started to pull up her shirt exposing her entire stomach to this girl.<br />
<br />
Just then the cute boy opened the drive through window with their order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your drinks.... uh...&quot; he blushed starting at Ashley who was pulling up her shirt a bit before snapping it back down at the boy staring at her making her blush deeply and looking down completely embarrassed. The timing of this all caused the girl in the driver seat to burst out in a truly obnoxious laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baahaaahahaaha!&quot; she said enjoying the way things turned out before taking the drinks and putting them into the cup holder then pulling away and parking. Ashley got a bit frustrated and snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not funny... what the hell was that? Why did you need to see my belly button?... Who the hell are you.&quot; The girl took a sip of her latte and then glared a little at Ashley before starting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa. I&#39;m one of the towns VIPs like you. My father is the head of the board of education in this town.... I&#39;m the head cheerleader and also....&quot; she got a bit grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been granted status as your coach by P&R.&quot; she giggled to herself seeming to be really happy about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... what&#39;s that mean?... what even is P&R.... and how did those people... uh... er....&quot; Ashley trailed off not wanting to say it in front of this hot girl as she blushed. Alyssa raised a brow and then said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re a boy... or you were.&quot; she said with a smile making Ashley cringe as a wave of humiliation washed over her feel like she didn&#39;t know where to put her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; she said and Alyssa raised her hand and rudely put a finger up at her as she opened her phone showing how she had an app full of information on her with lots of details written out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t read it all yet, but basically in this town. When ever someone is marked down as &#39;problematic&#39; they are assigned a coach to help them adjust. Normally its some kind of authority figure like a boss or teacher, I think very rarely they some times use personal relationships like a spouse or parents...&quot; she then smirked over at her again adjusting her hair a bit before she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never expected that being cheer captain would let me have this sort of power over one of my squad members. This is going to be sick! You&#39;re basically assigned to be my beta bitch bestie.&quot; she giggled to herself making Ashley cringed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.. squad members?... IM a cheerleader?!&quot; she blurted out looking down at herself a moment only making Alyssa laugh more. Ashley pouted a bit before going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what kind of power do you have over me? And what exactly is P&R?&quot; she asked twisting her hands kind of scared. This made Alyssa let out a sweet and condescending.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww! Don&#39;t worry its nothing bad its just...&quot; she thought about how to explain it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is P&R? They pretty much own this whole town... sort of the people as well I guess, but don&#39;t worry you and me got some nice roles so it&#39;s no biggie, and to explain the other thing let me see your phone.&quot; she said flipping out her hand.<br />
<br />
Ashley fished around in her purse handing over her Phone with the ID on the back. Alyssa then took it and held it out to the side of her car like she was going to drop it. Ashley suddenly felt an anxious knot in her stomach as Alyssa watched her and then handed it back feeling released.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see how you got all anxious when you were getting separated from your ID and phone? It&#39;s pretty much like that. When ever you don&#39;t listen to me or my suggestions you&#39;ll get anxious. Plus you&#39;ll feel more natural being submissive to me.&quot; she then made a grossed out face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuk. I hate saying you&#39;re submissive to me... its like some sex thing and there will be NO sex thing between you and me... expect like talking about boys I guess.&quot; Ashley grimaced at this and shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like boys.&quot; she snapped and then Alyssa just giggled at this for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... so what happened to get marked as problematic your first day? You normally need to try to contact outside or escape or just keep causing issues for that to happen.&quot; she asked taking another sip of her drink and then taking the second latte from the cup holder and holding it out as if to offer it to Ashley. Ashley took the latte and sipped it cringing at how sweet it was not used to this sort of drink before she went on to explain her morning. Alyssa looked pretty surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... that sounds... odd? That was a pretty big over reaction... was there anyone else there at the center?&quot; she asked raising a brow. Ashley thought about it and then explained the weird encounter with the pizza girl and how she had the same outfit as the girl from the day before. Right as she explained that it looked like Ashley finally started to realize what happened now being aware of the sort of changes these P&R people can do.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOH! Okay.. .that makes a lot more sense.&quot; Alyssa declaimed before taking a sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just some bad luck... for you... good for me.&quot; she smiled a bit and winked before she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those people were likely called in to deal with the pizza girl and you just happen to act up while they were still around... normally from what you did it just be a couple of shocks and maybe a little cosmetic tweaks at most.&quot; she explained as if that was meant to be reassuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway.&quot; she said adjusting the mirror. &quot;We need to get a move on we got a full schedule today. She said with a wink before she pulled out of the coffee shop with the Prosperity Bucks logo.</p>
