<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After all the excitement (and the inclusion of 11 infants) things finally settled down into a Thanksgiving like all others. Lisa, with Katie on her hip, found herself talking with her mother about raising Katie and Gloria. For Lisa it was a cathartic experience. Lisa over time was able to explain everything her and Katie had been through over the past 20 years. Marilyn for her part listened intently, apologizing for being as stubborn as she was. Marilyn finally admitted that she had let her mother determine how she raised her family. <br />
<br />
“I just want to apologize Lisa,” Marilyn whispered. “I was so hurt after Kellie died. I wanted only the best for Katie and in doing so pushed you away.”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded as the infant Katie stirred in her arms. “I get it mom,” she sighed. “Still why would you have freaked out so much about Kellie being gay. I mean seriously do you hate gays or something?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Marilyn said quickly. “I mean, Well? It’s not that I hate gays but I know the difficulties they have. Especially 20 years ago. It’s difiuclt enough now for gays and lesbians. Imagine what it was like...well..now. When it comes to you and your sisters all I’ve ever wanted is for you to succeed. I was worried she would be held back by who she loved.”<br />
<br />
As Lisa nodded she could feel Katie begin to to cry softly. Looking down she could see the infant seeming to gesture to another blond infant nearby. “Of course what was I thinking,” Lisa smiled. Bending down she scooped up the infant Kellie, cradling the two in her arms.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Katie,” Lisa whispered. “Forgot you probably want to be with Kellie.” The blond infant smiled as she wiggled close to the honey blond baby in Lisa’s arms.<br />
<br />
Gloria had watched everything transpire from her seat on the couch. Slowly she was regaining her strength but still felt exhausted from what she had done. As she glanced around the room she could see her family happily talking while taking care of a room full of infants. Gloria smiled as she noticed that the couples, even in infancy seemed to gravitate towards one another.<br />
<br />
A small boy, no older than one seemed to hover over a red headed infant who was attempting to stand. Another one year old boy watched as a happy brunette infant giggled happily at the goofy faces Jackie and Ann were making at them. Jason held a blond infant and a Japanese baby that seemed to be babbling at one another. Sitting at his feet an Asian boy who smiled and drooled at a blond baby who was sitting next to her brunette friend. Sighing happily Gloria turned to see Lisa and Marilyn getting along, repairing the damage from the past 20 years.<br />
<br />
“You look tired Gloria,”<br />
<br />
Gloria tuned to see the kind face of her grandfather smiling at her. “Sorry grandpa,” she sighed. “Guess I kind of over did it.”<br />
<br />
Martin smiled as he gazed out at his family. “Well it was a hell of a spell I tell you,” he mused. “But it did finally get your mother and Marilyn to sit down and talk with one another.”<br />
<br />
Glira smiled, watching a teenage Lisa happily enjoy a conversation with her mom. “Yeah I did good,” she said happily. Turning she now looked back at her grandfather, the man had an impish smile plastered on his face.<br />
<br />
“Grandpa,” Gloria asked. “Why is it you seem so comfortable with all this? I mean Inliterally altered reality to make all this happen and yet you seem to just shrug it off like it’s no big deal.”<br />
<br />
Martin smiled as he leaned close to his granddaughter. “Let me tell you a story,” he said. “Many, many years ago a shy awkward kid, me, fell in love with the most popular, outgoing, beautiful girl at his school. Unfortunately that boy was awful in social situations and the girl would never notice him. That is...until he found an old wizard and a Magic Shop.”<br />
<br />
Gloria’s eyes grew wide as she slowly began to understand what her grandfather was saying. “Grandpa,” she whispered. “Are you telling me...”<br />
<br />
Martin shushed his granddaughter, holding a finger to her mouth. “Let’s just say a mutual friend of ours helped that boy get noticed by that popular girl. The rest...well...as you can see it worked out pretty well.”<br />
<br />
Gloria stared shocked at Martin, understanding what he was implying. Without magic Gloria’s family wouldn’t exist. “Gloria,” he said solemnly. “I’ve never spoken of this to anyone and I hope you can keep this secret between you and me.”<br />
<br />
Gloria smiled, hugging her grandfather tightly. “Don’t worry grandpa I won’t say a word.”<br />
<br />
Martin smiled returning his granddaughters hug. “Thanks Gloria just say hi to Merlin for me the next time you see him.”<br />
<br />
As dinner was completed Lisa and Marilyn now began cleaning up dinner, thankfully the infants had fallen asleep and were resting quietly on a comforter spread out in the living room. “I’m glad we finally got to talk mom,” Lisa said happily as she finished loading the dishwasher. Marilyn smiled as she wiped down the counters. “So am I Lisa,” she said. “I’m so..so sorry for how things happened....well...the first time we had this Thanksgiving.”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay mom,” Lisa smiled. “Like you said I’m  as stubborn as you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Lisa you are,”Marilyn giggled. “But your also an incredible woman who is an incredible mom. Both your daughters have grown into such beautiful, intelligent women.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s hope the next one grows up just like them,” Lisa said, patting her stomach.<br />
<br />
“You know,” Marilyn mused. “It could be a boy, know your father and Jason would be overjoyed with that idea.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn and Lisa looked at each other before laughing softly. As they finished cleaning they could see that they were beginning to return to their original ages. “Guess the spell is ending,” Lisa said s she became 25. Marilyn nodded as she noticed Jason, Martin and Gloria beginning to change back to how they were at the beginning of the day. “So it seems,” she said. “Although I’m curious why Ann and her friend haven’t changed back yet.”<br />
<br />
“Or the babies,” Lisa added, noticing the sleeping infants remained unchanged.<br />
<br />
As Lisa and Marilyn aged back to normal they noticed the house begin to shimmer. Slowly but surely the home changed back to what it once was. A giant flat screen t.v replace the bulky one of years ago while the ancient cellphones returned to the smart phones they were accustomed too. Marilyn smiled as she looked at Lisa’s home. “Looks like the place is yours once more,” Marilyn said as she once again became 68. Lisa nodded as her body once more became 39. Her face having lost it teenage appearance, becoming an adult once more. “Looks like it Mom,” she sighed. “Guess you two are heading home?”<br />
<br />
Marilyn sighed sadly as she walked towards her husband. “I’m afraid so,” she said as she helped her husband stand. “It’s getting late and your father really shouldn’t drive at night. His eyes are starting to get bad.”<br />
<br />
“I can still see well enough dear,” Martin said. “And I can still see just how beautiful you are.” Marilyn smiled placing a gentle kiss on her husbands cheek. Martin in turn smiled, squeezing his wives hand. “How did I end up with such a wonderful man,” Marilyn sighed happily. Martin turned to Gloria, giving her a wink. “Not sure dear,” he said. “Maybe it’s magic.”<br />
<br />
Lisa, Gloria and the others now waved happily as Martin and Marilyn drove off, promising they would visit again soon. When they were finally out of sight Lisa sighed happily leaning into her husband. “You feeling alright Lisa,” Jason asked. Lisa nodded giving her husband a quick peck on the lips. “Yeah,” she smiled. “Yeah I am. Mom and I cleared the air and it looks like we can expect to see her more often, especially with a new grandchild on the way.”<br />
<br />
Lisa now looked at her tired 14 year old daughter. “So Gloria,” she asked. “Exactly how long is our home going to be a daycare?”<br />
<br />
Gloria looked down at her ring before smiling. “Shouldn’t be too much longer mom,” she said. “Katie and her friends should be back to normal in less than an hour.”<br />
<br />
“What about us,” Jackie and Ann asked.<br />
<br />
“Well you two get to have fun with each other this weekend,” Gloria said happily. “Whether you spend it at 22, 14, 2 or anything in between is up to you. Just have fun.” Jackie and Ann squealed with joy as they happily began discussing their plans. As they did Gloria smiled. Having made up with Katie, repaired her moms relationship with her family and welcoming a new sibling into the family Gloria wondered what adventures awaited her in the future.</p>
