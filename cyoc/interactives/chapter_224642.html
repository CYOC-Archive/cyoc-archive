<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;With those two love-birds out of the way, let&#39;s see what we can do with the remaining three... hmm... I have an idea!&quot; said Lesley<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave, you&#39;ve been working really hard lately, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ve been working every overtime I can to give my girls every opportunity I can,&quot; replied Dave in a monotone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that sweet folks?&quot; asked Lesley to the audience, who half clapped and went &quot;aww&quot; at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure that really hasn&#39;t given you much time to connect with your daughters has it, girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he&#39;s always busy working,&quot; answered Terri and Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, which one of you feels the most distant from your father?&quot; asked Lesley, and immediately Jessica&#39;s hand went up.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, well, at the end of this, folks David here will definitely be more connected with Jessica than he was before. David, I want you to start getting younger,&quot; said Lesley.<br />
<br />
The middle-aged David seemed to shiver at first. His posture was the first thing to recover, followed by the small pouch his belly had been growing disappearing. The few grays in his hair at this temples vanished, and muscles he&#39;d let slide began to freshen up and grow. He grew out a beard which then trimmed down to a five o&#39;clock shadow. David left his thirties for his twenties and soon was looking more of a hunky college student, just a few years older than his eldest daughter Terri.<br />
<br />
&quot;Younger still, David, back before puberty,&quot; said Lesley after staring intently at David and Terri and Jessica for a few moments.<br />
<br />
David complied. His five o&#39;clock shadow along with his athletic physique fading away rather quickly as the college student shrank back to high school senior, and then rather quickly to a lanky acne riddled freshman with braces on his teeth. The lankiness subsided as the young teen left high school for middle school and his body, feet, and hands shrank until he was a rather proportional twelve years old boy on the cusp of puberty, but clearly on the boyhood side of it--as old as Kevin had been a few minutes ago. In fact, David quite looked like Kevin had a few moments ago, and could be taken for being Kevin&#39;s kid brother now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Younger still, back before you started school,&quot; said Lesley with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
David continued to grow younger, his height continuing to shrink, and this time he was beginning to acquire some fat, baby fat as he went from Middle School to Elementary School, then Primary School. His hands which had once been rather large were now shrinking to tiny chubby crayon grippers, and David was still getting younger, leaving Kindergarten for Preschool--his bottom eventually swelling up with tell-tale crinkle sound of a diaper when he stopped getting younger and started sucking his thumb at age 2--too young for preschool.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, think back to the day you were born, and then stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two year old David continued to grow smaller, eventually finding too hard to stand as he fell onto his baby butt, all while continuing to suck his thumb, which at age one was replaced with a pacifier, and he was no longer sitting on the floor by himself, now he was scooped up into a baby carrier that appeared beneath him. Eventually this too vanished as the baby carrier turned into a tiny infant hospital bed that newborns are put in after being born. On the foot of the infant wheeled bed, David&#39;s name: Jones, David Michael, was written. Lesley scooped the newborn David, wrapped in a blue blanket up from the infant wheeled bed and rocked him a bit before putting him back into the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;For this next part, I&#39;m going to need Jessica to grow about... two years older,&quot; said Lesley.<br />
<br />
Jessica grew up a bit, filling out her womanly shape as she went from a teenager to a young woman of 18 years old, and a college freshman. Lesley then picked up David and placed him in Jessica&#39;s arms before pulling out her crystal and dangling it in front of both Jessica and David&#39;s faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica, the baby in your arms is your baby, no one else. All other relations with anyone else on this stage are severed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica&#39;s body now shifted, her breasts growing a slight bit larger with milk, and her body now adding on a few extra pounds and stretch marks to show she&#39;d been carrying a baby for nine months until fairly recently.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, you are no longer the father of anyone on this stage. You are now in your mommy&#39;s arms, and you are hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
David began to fuss, and Jessica responded by looking for somewhere to sit down. Lesley beckoned for a chair to be brought out on stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Jessica, no one will judge you for doing what mothers do to feed their babies,&quot; said Lesley.<br />
<br />
Jessica then unabashedly shifted her shirt and unbuttoned her bra and brought her son David to it to suckle. Within a few moments, David had latched onto the nipple and was feeding just fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing connects a mother more to her baby than nursing... well actually there is something a bit more connected. David, you&#39;re getting younger, back to before your birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
David stopped suckling, and Jessica&#39;s clothes transformed into a hospital gown. The chair she was sitting it shifted into birthing stirrups, and suddenly from beneath the hospital gown, a fleshy tube appeared, which Lesley took in hand along with David and connected the two. David was now connected to his mother through an umbilical cord and Lesley eased David back into Jessica and through the process of birthing in reverse. After a few minutes, David was now inside of Jessica and settled in her womb as her water unbroke, and the hospital gown disappeared in favor of maternity clothes. Jessica placed her hand on her swollen belly protectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, how connected do you feel to your son, Jessica?&quot; asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Completely--though with the amount of kicking he&#39;s doing, he&#39;s sure ready to come out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he is... but we&#39;re not done with this transformation yet, folks! David may be better connected with Jessica, but he isn&#39;t with Terri... and I have just the idea for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesley pulled out her crystal and showed it in front of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terri, you are about to transform into the young man you&#39;d be had you been born male at birth. When I say go, you will turn into that young man and will become the older brother of Kevin, the long-term boyfriend of Jessica, and father to David. You both will be in a serious relationship, but you are nervous about taking things to the next step. You may want to take off your clothes so they don&#39;t rip during the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Become a man, older brother of Kevin, boyfriend to Jessica, father to David...&quot; repeated Terri monotonously as she took off all her clothes, leaving her unabashedly naked in front of the entire audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;And... go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri&#39;s first transformation began at her feet, which swelled up several sizes, followed shortly by her ankles and calves adjusting to the larger feet by becoming thicker and longer. Her thighs responded rather quickly afterwards, giving her at least an extra foot of height from the 5&#39;7&quot; she had been to the 6&#39;7&quot; she now stood. Apparently, had she been born male, she&#39;d have been a tall boy. Hands and arms shot out to match the extra length, stretching out her already thin frame to give her a rather skinny and lanky frame. Her butt shrank as her hips went from being capable of giving birth to not. Her shoulders responded by expanding at the same time. Then, to match the powerful calves she had acquired early on, her thighs, glutes, abs, pecs, biceps, forearms and delts all swelled until they were a lean runner&#39;s build. Terri wasn&#39;t a muscle boy, but he clearly was quick on his feet it seemed--like Kevin had been. The changes then came to her neck as it swelled just slightly and the sight of an Adam&#39;s apple appeared. Her jaw squared resembling her former father&#39;s appearance at that age rather uncannily. Her long brown hair shortened until it was rather closely cut. As that occurred, a five o&#39;clock shadow appeared on her chin and a light dusting of hair began appearing all over her legs, arms, chest, and gathered rather thickly in her arm pits, the center of her chest, which stretched a thin line down past her navel to a thick pubic bush. Terri then moaned, her voice deepening to a baritone as her clitoris swelled and shifted in shape and location until it became a penis, and her vagina sealed, her labia swelled into a sac, and with a distinctly erotic moan that caused Terri&#39;s new rod to go stiff with an erection, her former ovaries dropped into her sac and became his balls, completing the transformation of Terri into the man she&#39;d be had she been born a 19 soon to be 20 year old college student. And he definitely could be taken for being Kevin&#39;s brother--if not his twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s your name?&quot; asked Lesley<br />
<br />
&quot;Terry, short for Terence,&quot; said Terry with a rather cocky grin and self assurance that oozed charisma.<br />
<br />
Lesley then came over to Jessica and shined the crystal in her face one last time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessica, Terry is your long-term boy friend and father to your baby. You would like to make things more serious and so you&#39;ve taken the opportunity to use the magic of this hotel to announce your pregnancy to Terry and see how he reacts, which you&#39;ll do now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terry, there&#39;s something I want to tell you,&quot; said Jessica as if she were out of the trance and instead in the privacy of their room in a resort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, babe, you&#39;re pregnant!&quot; exclaimed Terry as if he were also out of the trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to surprise you and get a sneak peak of what our baby would look like so I used the magic of this resort to find out. Congrats Terry, you&#39;re gonna be a daddy to a boy!&quot; announced Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;A daddy... uh...&quot; said Terry nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong babe?&quot; asked Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-nothing... well, it&#39;s just this is a bit of a shock to me. We were just having some fun last week and now suddenly I&#39;m gonna be a Dad... it&#39;s just a lot to take in,&quot; said Terry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can make him younger again, we don&#39;t have to see him now,&quot; said Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you? I... mean, sure, whatever you want babe,&quot; said Terry.<br />
<br />
Jessica then seemed to concentrate and her pregnant belly shrank through trimesters and months of pregnancy until she hardly looked pregnant at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;How young?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he&#39;s back to where he started, just a few days old since we conceived him,&quot; assured Jessica, who came over and hugged the naked Terry who didn&#39;t seem to know how to react to touching her at first before tentatively placing his hand where her pregnant belly had once stretched out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna be a dad in nine months,&quot; said Terry nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terry, you&#39;re looking the same way you did when you first learned I had a crush on you and not your brother. Like a deer in headlights. If fatherhood, which you will be great at whenever you&#39;re ready for it, is too much for you right now... we can undo it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to get an abortion just on account of me not feeling ready to be a dad,&quot; said Terry rather quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never get an abortion... but since we&#39;re here at this resort we don&#39;t have to. We can just unmake our baby by having sex in reverse. I read about it in the room handbook.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex in reverse?&quot; asked Terry, his penis pricking up a bit, but not to a full erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we start having sex, and then when you feel like you&#39;re getting close to cumming, I will our baby younger and instead of an ejaculation you&#39;ll suck his sperm right back up your shaft and back into your balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Won&#39;t that kill him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, if we leave the resort like that--but if we want to re-conceive him later, we just have to will him older when having sex again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not so thrilled about that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or we could make him older and turn him into a brother, uncle, father, grandfather, cousin, or something else.&quot;</p>
