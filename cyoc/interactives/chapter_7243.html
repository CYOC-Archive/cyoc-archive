<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sid gave a call that night to brother Frank and informed him of Boston Bob's Circus was coming to the town of Cooper. It was agreed that Frank and Franky would meet Sid and Stormy Matt the next Thursday at the carnival.<br />
<br />
Thursday came at last as Sid pulled into the parking area Frank and son were waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we ready?&quot; asked Sid as he gave a father son hug to Matt.<br />
<br />
At the gate was a bearded old lady that thirty years back was a young bearded lady. &quot;Oh my lord, Sid and Frank!&quot; she yelled as the lady jumped from her perch and began to hug them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Marge, still got a broken shaver!&quot; said Frank with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ole' fool, they're stick on and you know it, what are you way out here for?&quot; she asked looking first at one and then the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Mark still running the Carny?&quot; asked Frank now in a business like tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea he's in the red wagon, you got a problem with him?&quot; asked Marge back seeing his more than stern face. As the four walked on to the red wagon Marge stood again on her perch as huckster elite.<br />
<br />
Frank was first to notice a black Welsh pony tied to a lead rope with several other horses. He pointed to the animal but the troop walked on. Around the far side of the main tent was the business wagon painted bright circus red. Sid stepped up to the door and gave a knock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea I'm in but if your the police we don't hire crooks!&quot; yelled the man inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm looking for four thieves of the Percheron gang!&quot; yelled Sid.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door burst open so fast he almost knocked Sid off the porch. &quot;I'll be damned, Frank, Sid, and no doubt the youngen's, welcome, welcome, come on in!&quot; said Mark a pudgy man about five foot six.<br />
<br />
Once inside the four sat down at different spots. &quot;Mark we have a problem with Father's wand.&quot; said Sid.<br />
<br />
Mark who was leaning back in his chair sat directly up and took serious notice. &quot;What kind of trouble, not those Percherons?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no besides their long since dead and gone....&quot; Sid said as Mark held up a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope not at all dead, in fact you passed them tied to the feeding line near Marge's ticket booth. I can't remember the words your dear father said when he pointed the wand at those four but they started off as colts, Then in a year or two they matured to four perfect stallion Percherons. Since those days the four hasn't aged a day! I work them as I would any big horse but the four keep living on and on.&quot; told Mark of the animals past.<br />
<br />
Frank being the oldest of the brothers said, &quot;Yea Dad didn't state the duration, you know like &quot; and for the rest of your life, or permanent? So with out a period at the end of a sentence they go on being Percherons till who knows when!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's the bitch about the Percherons?&quot; asked Mark now wondering all the more.<br />
<br />
Sid looked at Stormy Matt and began to cantert the long story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, so Sid's son Matt is my black Wonder Pony, that makes good sense he listens well and does exactly what he's told. I thought he was a trained pony, and a damn good one too! Does Stormy want to work for me here in his place?&quot; asked Mark thinking of his special act and the draw he'd had for these past weeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know what to do at this point! If Stormy returns to his body he won't carry the learned knowledge along and you will have a old and everyday ignorant animal. However I can't let my gay son Matt live out his life as a Welsh stud either, so I'm looking for some answer.&quot; wondered Sid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea!&quot; said Franky as he rubbed his groin.<br />
<br />
Sid looked at him as Frank turned and batted the boy's hands from playing with his new oversized cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Stormy returns to quickly to being a pony he will forget anything he learned, right? OK, then if Stormy continued on and went to nightschool he would be taught reading, writing, spelling, and then understand, right? Well let Matt and I exchange places for a month or three at a time to keep Matt's mental state from degrading to true pony. He could live with Frank for a time and then regain his manners. I on the otherhand would be you bright and learned pony to continue the act, OK?&quot; asked Franky.<br />
<br />
Mark looked at the two brothers for any agreement since this kept him off the hook and in the money. Sid turned to Frank Sr. and said nothing. Frank stared out into the middle of the room knowing his son Frank Jr. wanted to be the stallion for more than just to help everybody out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could Stormy learn his knowledge in say six months?&quot; asked Frank Sr.<br />
<br />
Sid looked at Stormy and then over to Frank Jr. &quot;I can't say, a person learns according to his ability. I remember that it took me a couple of years to get it together, so I'd think we'd have to work it along that far anyway.&quot; said Sid sounding sad for the real Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALRIGHT, damn it, but I don't want my silly son put to stud while he's making time for the others!&quot; said Frank Sr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed!&quot; spouted Mark being more than willing to keep his prime act going at any cost.<br />
<br />
Mark went out to get the pony as the four sat looking at the others.<br />
<br />
The sound of a fraile whinnie made the four get up and walk outside. Suddenly the pony reared up high and pawed the air at the sight of Sid and Matt's previous body. Snorting, white of his dark eyes showing he whinnied even louder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Son I know thois is you as your body continues on with Stormy the Welsh pony's life entity. We have a plan to trade you and Frank Jr. off from stallion to human till Stormy can be taught to carry on in his true form. Now if we are ready?&quot; said Sid as he pulled the magic wand from his inside coat pocket.<br />
<br />
A Stormy black pony quickly calmed down as then Frank Jr. stood next to him. Sid took the wand and passing it over the two gave his ultimate blessing. The orb glowed brightly as all present cover their eyes except the black little stallion.<br />
<br />
As the brightness dimmed to normal Frank Jr. said with a broad smile, &quot;I'm human again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Sr. looked at his son's body and then down to the black pony. &quot;Well this is fine for your son, gay or not but fro my son he is back to being the animal and from the looks of his big hard'on he's enjoying the form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sid, Frank Jr., and Stormy Matt turned to see the pony begin to masterbate. &quot;Go for it!&quot; said Stormy.<br />
<br />
Frank Sr. just grumbled as the five men walked the black pony over to the feed line. There standing in all their perfect glory was four huge, full grown stallion Percherons. The horses seemed to be aware of Sid and the wand somehow as they tried to back away from the feedline.<br />
<br />
As Sid pulled the wand from his pocket Mark asked, &quot;what are you planning to do, they're perfect as they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing too rash my friend I just want to check someone's theory!&quot; said Sid as he passed the wand near the heads of the huge four animals. &quot;My Father made you to be as horses, proud, strong, and willing for work, I grant you the ability of speach, but just for today! Beware less you give away who you once were to any other than us five men, lest those male globes be cut and a new more calm life be yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I...., I can speak!&quot; said one of the Percherons.<br />
<br />
Clearing of throats and soon they four spoke clear and in the King's proper English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stallions, it has been suggested that the curse placed on you for being thieves was not a curse but a blessing of sensual pleasures and wild well enjoyed animal sex, so what is it?&quot; asked Sid as then the Black pony tilted his ears to hear the answer.<br />
<br />
A husky voice cleared his throat, then looking at his fellow Percherons he began to speak. &quot;We were at first terrified of being colts, the animal body governed us to act like colts. We suckled mare's teats for the milk the instincts made us search out. We sniffed the mare's urine to tell her from anyother. We learned to graze and with that our mind's calmed, we accepted what your Father did as for us a better way of life. He was right to wish us cursed as we were rough men with little care for others. We stole, mamed, injured, even killed, but until we became beasts of burden and property, nothing mattered! Since the passing of our first year together as yearlings we knew without speaking the same as if we had talked this all out. We four Arnie, Sam, Grant, and me Les, wish to thank you and your Father for making us useful to others and ourselves. We work together in pairs or as four. We are kind about small people and kids, being very aware for their safety. We watch for trouble and even theives and make Mark aware as best we can. Mark too has an understanding with us as he loans us out to farms for stud service during the early Spring and Fall when mares come in heat the most. He know's what it must be like to have big balls, big cocks, and the stress they can excert on a body. He earns a price for our service and we enjoy ourselves during those few months as only Percherons could!&quot; told Les their story.<br />
<br />
Sid looked at Mark, &quot;Money, money money!&quot; he said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, I'd do it even if they were real true born animals, they need release the same as all males. Heck I get $500. for each as they service the farmers mares per season. That money goes to buy hay and feed to keep those little guys eating at their normal rate. I'm not rich, but if you let me borrow the wand when next the bill collector come around I'll soon be solvent.&quot; chidded Mark as he opened a wishful hand for the wand.<br />
<br />
The four Percheron horses stood nickkering the other in full glee as then Stormy Matt spoke up. &quot;Can we get going I must get to learning so I might be myself again, please?&quot;<br />
<br />
A shake of hands all around and the four men went back to their cars. A friendly Welsh stallion stood short and low, reaching his head high to lick the old semen from a Percheron's filthy sheath.<br />
<br />
Mark had a few coarse words for Frank Jr.'s actions but was stopped by stallion Sam. &quot;Hey even if he's gay there's a place in the world for him! Yea, chimed in the other three, He can lick our cocks clean, he can lick all the mares dirty teats, and when the mare's drip from heat he can lick their juices too, he's perfect for our needs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked at the black pony, &quot;Gay huh, would you prove it by not mounting any mares, I don't need any new foals, they're expensive!&quot; grumbled Mark. A signal for the show to start had Mark lead Frank Jr. Welsh stallion elite to the center ring.<br />
