<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle stood outside the school, his body changed in strange but sexy ways, the now hermaphrodite struggled to cope with the new sensations that were thrust upon him. He was a strange site, a young man dressed in a black jacket, red t-shirt, blue jeans and black sneakers, surrounded by four sets of female legs, complete with genitals and up to the navel, completely naked and pointed in four directions, to his sides and behind him. The boy struggled against the new legs he now possessed, his own legs kicking around, nearly a foot off the ground, nearly kicking his new calves if it weren&#39;t for how restricted his legs were against the new woman parts. <br />
<br />
For a few minutes he squirmed against this mockery when thoughts flooded his brain, his head spun, new knowledge came to him, how to move and maneuver, how to clean his female parts, and shave the new legs, then the knowledge of his measurements hit him, and he froze.<br />
<br />
&quot;God Damn....&quot; Kyle gasped, the measurements given to him about himself hit like a ton of bricks. His new hips were measured at 46&quot;, his legs were from the thigh down a solid 36&quot;, his shoe size was a women&#39;s US size 9. He now was a height of 6&#39;4&quot; because of the way his waist had changed to support and allow all of these legs and asses to surround him. Kyle stood in stunned silence for a minute, then as if this was normal, put his pants in his pockets and began to walk home, his sexy legs moving like a spider, his male legs just dangling, much to his distaste, but he now knew he&#39;d never be able to move comfortably with his own feet on the ground. <br />
<br />
Finally reaching home he tried entering the apartment, his mother would be home a few hours from now, which gave him time to check himself out, he walked through the apartment and discovered a new problem, with the width of all his new asses, the door frames were a few inches too small for him, he tried to force his way through, trying to squeeze his legs tighter against him, trying to move through at different angles, finally with a scream of frustration he tried to run at the door, his legs getting caught, and shoving him back against the wall as they pressed against the frame. &quot;Fuck! I can&#39;t even enter my home! Fuck you Jen!&quot; He shouted to himself, then got an idea, he approached the door and started to move his right set of legs into the door frame, then pulled himself through, moving each pair of legs up as they reached the door, his knees pressed against his back and side as set by set he moved in a semicircle to find himself inside the apartment facing the door, having done a 180 to get into the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Kyle groaned, this was going to be his new normal, and it was already a nightmare, he moved through the apartment, fortunately the rest of the doors in the home were slightly wider than the front door, he got into his room and finally dropped his backpack on the floor, the only things changed in his room were his dresser, having expanded, and a new full body mirror. He walked over to the mirror and looked at himself, then nearly cried, he always wanted to see Mrs. Lorenza naked, most guys did, but he never thought it would be like this, collapsing to the floor he looked around him, everywhere he looked he saw the sexy legs of Mrs. Lorenza, her light mocha skin soft and smooth, legs spread around him in their resting state. He punched his new parts and winced in pain, pushing against them he tried to remove them in vein.<br />
<br />
In frustration he tore off his jacket and shirt, staring at the mirror he saw the skin of his new waists blend into an now ab toned stomach, and fading off to the pale chest he was used to. Kyle took off his pants, he was already mostly naked, why not be completely naked. His view of himself gave him a hard-on, he had weird fetishes anyway, this was turning him on, all four of his new pusses started aching for attention, he got up, starting to shack with lust, and not knowing what he was reaching for he got into the top drawer of his dresser, an assortment of pants and panties for Mrs. Lorenza was carbon copied into his top drawer, as was a set of four insertable vibrators. He grabbed all four of them, scrambling to solve his new hunger, he dropped back down to the floor and started inserting the vibrators into his pussies turning each on one as he did, moaning like he never moaned before, his four thigh pressing together, his legs rubbing against each other as he lost control and started pounding his cock. Kyle spent an hour lost in repeated orgasms, feeling more pleasure than he had felt in his life, let alone sensations that he had never thought he would, his most wanted fantasy, to be a woman for a day, being made real in the most strange way. <br />
<br />
His one person orgy ended as all four vibrators finally ran out of power and he was left sweaty, naked and panting. Shaking he grabbed the sides of his head and let out one last loud and lustful moan as he looked up to the ceiling. Finally getting all of this out of his system, and nearly two hours after he got home, Kyle was finally accepting his new reality. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need a fucking shower.&quot; Kyle muttered as he got up and proceeded to maneuver himself to the bathroom. A new problem came up, not only was it difficult to move through the house, the shower was just a bit too narrow, being a long enough length to do what he needed to do. Kyle stepped into the shower and started to wash as usual, until he got to his waist, and tried to figure out what to do, finally he lifted the first set of legs to his left, and found himself getting hard again at the sight of his own legs resting against the glass of the shower as he hesitated to touch them. &quot;Their yours Kyle, get the fuck over it.&quot; He said sternly as he forced himself to wash himself, showering took a lot more time, cleaning and maintaining ten sets of legs, especially the length and proportion of these was a lot more complicated, especially for the back pair, thank god for shower brushes he thought. Finally finished he got himself dry and made his way back to his bedroom, the stench of sex was hanging in the air, he opened a window and sprayed the room with freshener as he selected four pairs of panties, and some boxers, gingerly putting on the panties for the first time, and wrestling with dressing his rear sets of legs, but finally figuring it out. <br />
<br />
He also put some tight short shorts on all four of his hips, and a pair of sweats on his own, he never liked his legs, but now, with eight of the most sexy legs he&#39;d ever seen, may as well show them off and see them for himself. He proceeded with his bookbag and went to the living room, spent fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to sit with his lower half and finally got himself comfortable, his side legs stretched out and crossed themselves across the couch, the rears hanging over the back, bouncing up and down absent mindedly, and his center sitting normally. He sat doing homework, every once in a while lifting one of his many legs and bringing it close to caress it, making sure this wasn&#39;t some surreal dream, and finished as his mom got home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi honey, looking good today! Did you just shave your legs?&quot; His mom asked. Kyle nearly answered that he just got these when he realized she wouldn&#39;t understand. So he ad libbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they were getting kinda annoying.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;See, what have I told you, us ladies need to keep these gams shaved, you don&#39;t want to walk around with prickly hairs all the time. I&#39;ll get dinner started here shortly, I need a shower first.&quot; His mom went back to her room and a wave of info slipped into his head, in this new reality, he suddenly grew these legs a few years ago, one morning he just woke up, and had four pairs of ridiculously sexy female Latino legs stapled to him. The doctors didn&#39;t know what to make of it, and named it a new genetic defect, Spontaneous MultiLimb Syndrome. It was rare, but not rare enough that it wasn&#39;t seen elsewhere, three other people, one of them Jennifer Smith, had been blessed with the defect, life would be strange from now on.</p>
