<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke up for another day, at first I was surprised that my mattress was different, but then I remembered that I had slept lying on top of Millie and I looked up towards her face. My friend was still sleeping and had gone through yet another change during the night, as her entire skin had changed color and was now a slightly lighter purple than her wings and tail.<br />
<br />
I climbed out from under her wings, careful not to wake her, and then went to the bathroom so I could take a shower before breakfast. As I showered I wondered what the future would be like, and then I started to wonder what could have caused Millie&#39;s transformation into a demon.<br />
<br />
Leaving the shower I went back to the bedroom and, when I got there, I found Millie. I started to wonder if I had already woken up or if everything that happened before was a dream because she was already dressed and was totally back to normal, no tail, no horns, no wings and no purple skin, just the Millie I lived with for the last few years. Just to add to my confusion my cell phone that had been destroyed yesterday was whole and working on the nightstand next to my bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the problem?&quot; Millie asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing, it&#39;s just that I woke up from a very strange dream in which you had turned into a demon.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;But this was no dream, I really became a demon.&quot; Millie said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t it a dream? So how did you get back to normal? And my cell phone? I&#39;m sure it had been destroyed.&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t get back to normal. You know, you remember seeing my new power yesterday don&#39;t you?  Today when I woke up with you sleeping on top of me I wondered if I hadn&#39;t acquired some new skills and tried to concentrate. I remembered your cell phone that I had broken and imagined it restoring itself and working again, when I did I was surprised to see the pieces of it fly into the room and the device restore itself on your nightstand. I remembered your cell phone that I had broken and imagined it restoring itself and working again, when I did I was surprised to see the pieces of it fly into the room and the device restore itself on your nightstand, I only understood what had happened when I looked in the wardrobe mirror and saw myself sleeping in the reflection, realizing then that I had become capable of creating illusions. I tested it some more and found two more things that I&#39;m able to do as well, which is freeze time and traverse solid objects.&quot; Millie said<br />
<br />
&quot;What? But how are you so sure about that?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;After you went to the bathroom I went after you, I came in applying an illusion so you couldn&#39;t see or hear me, so you didn&#39;t notice my presence. I walked through the door to come in and I was there the entire time you showered, I even masturbated while watching you clean yourself. As you were leaving I saw you freeze in place and I realized that time was frozen when I came out and saw that everything was still, including the birds in the air outside. I went back to the room and managed to unfreeze the time, but I applied the illusion for you to see me as I was before I changed just to see your reaction.&quot; Millie said and, as if a fog dissipated, the human version of her gave way to the naked demonic version of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you did all this in such a short time? You really have become quite powerful.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and with each new power I feel like it&#39;s instinctive to use it, it feels like my subconscious already knows everything.&quot; Millie said<br />
<br />
After that we had our breakfast and Millie said she was tired of staying at home, she wanted to hang out with me for a while. I asked her about her current shape and what she would do about her clothes, as none of them would fit her now that she had gotten bigger. I asked her about her current shape and what she would do about her clothes, as none of them would fit her now that she had gotten bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m already using my ability to create illusions to camouflage myself and everyone will see me just like my reflection in the mirror here. I am allowing you to be an exception and with that you are the only one able to see me for who I really am now.&quot; Millie said, showing in the mirror that in her reflection she was the normal human girl from before and was dressed, ready to go out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, I still haven&#39;t gotten used to what you&#39;re capable of doing now. And considering your current condition I believe your transformation is already complete.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
Millie and I went to the mall, we didn&#39;t intend to buy anything and just walked around looking at the windows and, from time to time, we went into a store to see something new.<br />
<br />
After so much walking we stopped at a snack bar to get something to eat. &quot;Millie, aren&#39;t you embarrassed to be naked in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a little embarrassed even though I know no one can see me in this form. I think it will still take some time for me to get used to it.&quot; Millie said<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine how it must be, I think I would feel the same if I were in your shoes.&quot; I said before changing the subject &quot;So what do you think we can do next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm.. I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m curious as to what caused my transformation, but I don&#39;t know where to look for information.&quot; Millie said<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see here, on the internet there must be some information.&quot; I said and took out my cell phone, where I searched the internet for &#39;how to turn a person into a demon?&#39; but I didn&#39;t even start to see the results and Millie called me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma, &#8203;&#8203;looks like my transformation isn&#39;t over yet. I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m starting to go through yet another change.&quot; Millie said and I looked at her, as I had no idea what could come next. She then looked down and I looked like she was surprised by something, then a happy smile covered her face. I wanted to know what she had seen and my curiosity was quickly quenched as the tip of a fully purple horse cock appeared from behind the table and continued to rise as the member grew hard. I stood up quickly so I could see that there was a ballsack growing between Millie&#39;s legs as well, but I was disconcerted when she started stroking her still growing cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Millie, don&#39;t do this. Remember we are in public.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I can not do it. I&#39;m very horny and the feeling is too good, my illusion must be covering me up, but if it&#39;s not being enoooooouuuu.... aaahhhhh....&quot; Millie said as her dick finished growing, I believe being 18 or 19 inches, and her balls ended up the size of melons. for at this very moment she came, letting go of her new member which swayed uncontrollably, shooting charge after charge of cum in all directions, with two of them hitting me squarely(one on the face and the other on my belly).<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh Millie, you could have at least pointed elsewhere. Look what you did to me.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it was just too good and I couldn&#39;t resist.&quot; Millie said without sounding sorry at all, and then she walked over to me, licked the cum off my face and kissed me on the mouth. <br />
<br />
I was totally taken aback when she did this and I had no reaction, I couldn&#39;t find the motivation to try to stop her until I felt something hot leave her mouth and enter mine, quickly descending my throat and spreading throughout my entire body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you kiss me like that Millie?&quot; I asked her<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I wanted to. You don&#39;t have to be mad at me about it, it&#39;s not like this is the first time we&#39;ve kissed.&quot; Emma said<br />
<br />
&quot;But we never kissed in public. Your illusion may be hiding you, but I can&#39;t say for myself. You could have waited until we...&quot; I was telling her, but then I felt pressure on the back of my pants, which quickly got stronger, so much so that the button on the jeans broke and the pants came down a little, but enough to give me some relief and allow see what it was. <br />
<br />
Looking back I saw a tail just like Millie&#39;s finish growing, the only difference being that my tail was scarlet red. I had no doubt this was a sign that I might be starting to turn into a demon too, but I still didn&#39;t know why. My feelings were confused, on the one hand I wanted it not to be real, that it was just another illusion created by Millie, but at the same time I felt a joy for being able to become the same being she had become.</p>
