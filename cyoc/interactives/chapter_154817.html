<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The November Issue of Animalia Magazine was important because of several things going on during November.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Because of Thanksgiving being next week, there was a large recipe section that talked about all the different kinds of food that were &quot;traditionally&quot; part of Thanksgiving Dinner, depending on what state you lived in, as well as substitutions to make them safe for Animalians. There were also parts of said recipes that told when and why certain foods became part of the Thanksgiving Dinner.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The &quot;Myths & Misconceptions&quot; section talked about many myths associated with the Thanksgiving dinner and Thanksgiving in general. For Example, the tryptophan in turkey wasn&#39;t directly responsible for people becoming sleepy. That was more related to the 2000+ calories consumed in one sitting.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also an article that talked about the James Bond movie series and their link to the first Perry Platypus Movie, and which things were real things and which were either exaggerated or artistic licensing. One that was a little surprising was the simple fact that there was such a thing as a &quot;lipstick pistol&quot; and that it was &quot;in the field&quot;, but other than that, there wasn&#39;t a lot of data on how effective it was due to the simple fact that many of the run-ins between the KGB and CIA still remained classified.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Probably the funniest things that were in the print version of the magazine were the various Thanksgiving-themed newspaper cartoons scattered around that either poked fun at either what to do or what not to do during the season; some infamous things about Thanksgiving dinner; or some important facts about thanksgiving.<br />
<br />
The overall funniest one was where a man finds out that he only gained a pound during thanksgiving, and could eat two to three slices of pie &quot;guilt-free&quot; while his wife asks &quot;Has our bathroom scale always sunk into the linoleum like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The most surprising thing was a story that told of how Sylvia managed to get a boyfriend by proving his innocence in a crime that wouldn&#39;t look out of place in an old-fashioned crime noir film.<br />
<br />
In it, Andrew Weary was accused of tampering with the brakes of his elderly father&#39;s car, leading to both his and his new stepmother, Paulina&#39;s death. During the trial, Sylvia (before heading off to her wintering destination) was asked to babysit Andrew&#39;s 4-year-old cousin because, as one juror put it, &quot;The evidence is there in black and white, but doesn&#39;t add up at the same time.&quot;, which led to the jury deliberating for at least two days.<br />
<br />
During it, Andrew&#39;s cousin Tommy decided to solve a mystery of his own and have Sylvia be his &quot;sidekick&quot;. Sylvia agreed thinking, <I>Why not? He&#39;s only a four-year-old, and doesn&#39;t know any better.</I> But during the game, they checked under Paulina&#39;s mattress for &#39;clues&#39; and found her personal journal. In it was proof beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew had been framed. To be absolutely sure, the local crime lab ran the journal through their questionable documents lab and proved that it was Paulina&#39;s handwriting in the journal.<br />
<br />
In it, Paulina had laid out a chilling plan to kill her husband and frame her stepson because she felt (like all young, desirable women feel when they marry a rich, elderly man) that she deserved more than $200,000 in a prenuptial divorce settlement. She had called Andrew over to change the oil of his father&#39;s car, thereby securing his prints under the car; then she disposed of the oil change equipment and sabotaged the brakes while wearing gloves to eliminate her own prints.<br />
<br />
With this evidence in hand, the defense reconstructed the events of the crime to prove that Andrew had been framed:<br />
<br />
After Adam changed the oil, but before Paulina sabotaged the brakes, Andrew&#39;s father took the car to buy some milk and cigarettes. After Paulina sabotaged the brakes, Paulina was heading to her car while Andrews&#39; father was heading to his, and slipped on wet gravel (it had been raining on and off the past few days before the &quot;accident&quot;), thereby knocking herself unconscious. Adam&#39;s father had managed, despite his advanced age, to lift her into his car intending to drive her to the hospital. The end result was that, not only had Paulina succeeded in killing her husband and framing her stepson, but also managed to kill herself by accident.<br />
<br />
This did end up with the clearing of Andrew&#39;s name of all charges, and his cousin Tommy did end up on the front page of the local paper. But the biggest winner was Sylvia because, after Tommy&#39;s parents picked him up and took him home, Andrew decided to spend time with Sylvia during her Brumination.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also a feature that was only available through the digital edition. It showcased many of the hunting fails from the carnivores who were part of Sgt. Bash&#39;s acclimation classes, mainly those who were part of hippie culture during the 60s. They were all different and ranged from branches breaking from beneath jaguar Animalians, to accidently breaking twigs underfoot, but they were all amusing in one way or another.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Perhaps what was some of the funniest things were some infamous photoshopped images of Animalians, but part of what made them infamous was the simple fact that there were many &#39;errors&#39; such as &#39;stretched&#39;, absent, or duplicated limbs, etc. that ended up generating a lot of laughs at seeing them. Some of them were from the most recent Spookyville Costume contest, while others were from older events.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
All together, it was both funny and educational to read the November issue of Animalia magazine.</p>
