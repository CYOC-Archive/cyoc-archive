<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys continued their game for a long time. So long in fact that Charlie grew bored of it. However, his friends/brothers showed no interest in stopping. Charlie was determined to stay entertained. <br />
<br />
“Make their boxers tighter,” Charlie said waving his hand. Each of the boys’ boxers shrunk further. Charlie waved his hand again and the boxers obliged. Charlie waved his hand multiple times as if conducting an orchestra and each of the boys’ boxers began to stretch out in fabric while still staying the same length. All the while no one took notice or care, everyone was too concerned with Eric’s continued ability to be too good. <br />
<br />
Charlie was eliminated and took the opportunity to wave his hand even more incessantly. Where before each of the boys had a relatively tight pair of undergarments with four different colors, they were now to stretched thin to even be recognizable. Amazingly they didn’t tear or rip. Charlie could see much of the boys’ skin underneath. <br />
<br />
Charlie had many ideas of ways he could screw with his friends. Without consequences, he’d put many in place. <br />
<br />
“Instead of penises, they all have a third arm,” Charlie said waving his hand. The boys adjusted themselves to the uncomfortableness that they could barely even register. Out of the small pocket in their boxers sprouted another arm, facing as if it were a right arm. A small sleeve appeared around the are of the boxers where the arms protruded. The boys moved them about as if they had always had them. In an effort to beat out Eric, David was using his third arm with his controller. <br />
<br />
“They all have bubble butts,” Charlie said waving his hand. His request was granted as it seemed like all of the boys almost grew a small amount in height. <br />
<br />
Charlie was extremely excited. He waved his hand and made all of his friends stand up and freeze. There they stood motionless ready for Charlie’s inspection. They sure were attractive specimens. And really, what was the need for these boxers anyways. <br />
<br />
“You will no longer wear any clothes of any kind,” Charlie said waving his hand. All of the boys stretched out boxers snapped like gunshots and exposed what little there was left to expose. <br />
<br />
“I want them to be mantaurs, another body from the waist down,” Charlie said waving his hand. <br />
<br />
The boys legs stretched outwards and back, skin and bone forming in between. A second set of abs formed. Another arm grew in place of what would’ve been another penis. To arms protruded from monstrous pecs. They along with the new legs now supported the original torso of each of his friends. <br />
<br />
“Now unfreeze, but each of your lower halves are constantly doing push ups,” Charlie said laughing. It was too much fun. As his four friends continued to play, their lower bodies began to work out. <br />
<br />
“Did you want to play?” Pat asked Charlie. To him everything was normal. <br />
<br />
“Nah,” Charlie said. “Not feeling it right now. I’m actually pretty tired.”<br />
<br />
It was a complete lie. Charlie had woken up after noon and was invigorated by this. <br />
<br />
“You have a point Charlie,” David said. He turned his upper body to look at Charlie with amazing flexibility. “It is pretty late.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Eric piped up. “And we have chores tomorrow while mom and dad are off.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Landon said as it became established that bed was to be in order. “We still didn’t beat Eric though.”<br />
<br />
Charlie eagerly turned of the tv and followed the massive men into the bedroom. They walked in an odd style, like a large elephant but with long outstretched back legs and constantly doing push ups. Despite this they moved a fast as if they were normal sized. <br />
<br />
Upon entering the back room, Charlie noticed that all of the new dressers were now gone. It made sense though, all of his friend brothers were permanently naked. They each crawled into bed, shaking it from their constant push ups, so Charlie put an end to that. <br />
<br />
Apparently, Charlie slept in the middle of this huge bed. Charlie had noticed that the bed was even larger now, there was little room for anything else in his room. Each of his friends curled up in a strange position, their secondary pairs of arms outstretched as if they were legs. Their two third arms were upright, as if having an erection. <br />
<br />
Charlie squeezed in between the gigantic muscled Pat and Landon. All of a sudden, the covers were drawn over him, probably by the other two on the end. Soon, all of the boys barring Charlie were snoring loudly, leaving Charlie to his own desires.</p>
