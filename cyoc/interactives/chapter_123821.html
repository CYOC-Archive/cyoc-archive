<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been nine years since Naomi began her relationship with Charlotte. A lot had happened in that time, TF-Parks had been opening all over the world, and the first generation of natural born anthros was established. Naked animal people also gave a release valve ironically on upset and angry people, who found more different about them that they did about their fellow humans. Welcome to humanity. <br />
<br />
In spite of being now outdated, and quaint at best by standards of its successors, TF Park USA had remained fairly population. <br />
<br />
Monroe was a girl who had just finished her collage degree in aerodynamic engineering, and she really, really, REALLY wanted to break away from society for a while, and just become something else. And she knew exactly what that something else was going to be. <br />
<br />
TF Park USA&#39;s selections of mammals was vast and varied, if you knew how deep to dig. There was one however that was an absolute marvel of genetic engineering and practical-engineering achievement, the scientists hadn&#39;t wanted it released until they were absolute sure it worked (didn&#39;t stop one or two from turing themselves into test subjects of course). The one mammal in existence that could fly: the bat. <br />
<br />
There had been some who wanted it released back when the best they could do was get someone to glide with their new wings, others engaged in some... rather disturbing tests to try and get the size down. But they did at last figure out a way to get the weight down without making the new bats as fragile as a sand castle or with a brain the size of a orange.  Monroe didn&#39;t understand all the details, she wasn&#39;t a geneticist, but she did know they&#39;d done it at last.<br />
<br />
In fact, the whole reason they&#39;d been delayed as long as they had, was because, there wasn&#39;t much point in BEING a bat unless you could fly. <br />
<br />
 And the new fad at TF Park USA had been the bats! The major population at TF Park USA went in cycles, sometimes it was the foxes, or the deer, or the wolves, but with the promise of true actual self powered flight had drawn people with more force than 50 Shades of Gray and the Twilight novels put together!<br />
<br />
First it had to be explained to those who became vampire bats that vampire bats did NOT actually SUCK blood, they weren&#39;t Mosquitoes after all. <br />
<br />
 Monroe didn&#39;t care much which species of bat she became, she just wanted what many wanted, the chance to shore through the air under her own power. She filled in the digital and triplicate disclaimer form that shielded the company&#39;s rear if something bad happened to her, but that was the price you paid for getting to go around naked for however long you visited being allowed to hunt or be served by the ninja like Huskies, legendary for their talents at remaining unseen by guests and un-smelled and unheard! <br />
<br />
Monroe look one look at herself that she&#39;d be seeing for a while, and stripped down, and placed her clothes in a locker where they&#39;d remain for a long time. And she stepped into the silence of the transformation room with the mirror on one side.<br />
<br />
Monoe looked through the listings, and at the first spotting of the flight capable mammals, the bats, she selected it at once, not caring which one it was.<br />
<br />
First she found out, much to her own shock, was that her maternal material shrank down to a meak A Cup, if not somehow smaller! She worried for a second she&#39;d pressed the TG or random button by mistake, but a look down below confirmed that she was still female. Surprised given the stereotypes of maternal material and anthros... guess it would be impractical and they were saving weight whoever they could. She also felt herself lose a few inches, if not more so, becoming a decidedly short woman. <br />
<br />
Also her hair vanished, leaving aerodynamic fur in its place, her entire body was covered by it, her ear became larger compared to the rest of her head like giant melted triangles, as her flat snout push forward and her fangs formed out of her mouth. A tiny tail formed out of the base of her spine. Her feet became claws meant for gripping and holding. The wings didn&#39;t grow out of her back like she thought they would, but her arms did grow in length, she kept her clawed hands, but out of her wrists grew four more bony &#39;fingers&#39; that were longer than her forearm, but folded up neatly when she tested the new muscles. Quickly, the leather membrane formed, creating her wings, a second set of leather membrane formed along her tail and her back side, again, folding easy.<br />
<br />
The transformation ended, and Monroe looked at herself in the mirror... small, slender... and she felt so light on her feet. She felt like she could jump over a house. The door into the park proper opened... and taking one last look at civilization, and at the mirror of her new self, Monroe set foot inside, and the cliff side closed behind her, leaving it unseeable. <br />
<br />
Looking at the slew of trees, Monroe already knew was she was going to do first. She took a deep breath, spread out her new wings, and took a flap, and instantly she was airborne. She let out a gasp seeing the ground shrink from below her feet, the tree tops now eye level, she almost fell before remembering to spread out her wings and let the light air above her pull her up. <br />
<br />
She soared, and spun, twisting and turning, feeling the wind all over her body, she never felt so alive. She never wanted to stop. But eventually, she did, and with her feet, grasped like they were hands on the top of a pine tree, and looked around at TF Park USA from a  view that none of its old visitor nine years ago had ever had. <br />
<br />
&quot;Velcome to my castle!&quot; <br />
<br />
Monroe startled, afraid she&#39;d lose her grip and fall, but she stayed perfectly marched. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Sorry! But that&#39;s just too golden a line not to use! Welcome to TF-Park newbie!&quot; <br />
<br />
Monroe turned and perched on the tree right next to her, was another bat.</p>
