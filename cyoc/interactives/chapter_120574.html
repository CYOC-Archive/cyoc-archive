<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa had a flurry of emotions flow through her as she moved to think on her answer. In a way she was greatly pleased to hear from Trevor again, even if soon after their first date, but at the same time she was also still silently confused over many of her dreams. The fact that she was constantly seeing a young woman that looked oddly like her or like her mother when she dreamed was something that was unsettling in a way. Her dream visitor saying that Trevor loved her was good news if true, as she was really attracted to him. He was fairly handsome physically and he was extremely kind. In many ways there was no reason for Trevor to be as open and friendly as he was, but yet he went all out to at least be a friend, and that was really what attracted her to him. <br />
<br />
However, the fact that much of this revelation was coming from something she couldn&#39;t place was unsettling to her. The guidebook that she&#39;d gotten from Megumi had made some mention of something called &quot;prophecy dreams,&quot; but the book said that it was typical that only weres had them and that they often seemed to provide insights into the future and truth of them was actually debated among were scientists. However, what Melissa had been experiencing wasn&#39;t quite looking into the future. She was talking with someone that looked like her or her mother and she could remember these conversations vividly. The fact that this spectral image was conversing with her was something at times was helpful, in that she had shown what she&#39;d look like as a were, somewhat, and had said that Trevor did love her, but the fact that she was constantly dreaming about the same &quot;person&quot; troubled her.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts however were soon interrupted when she heard Trevor&#39;s voice through the phone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;are you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I am,&quot; Melissa shook her head, &quot;Sorry. I just had some things on my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything bad?&quot; Trevor asked, his voice sounding nervous, &quot;it wasn&#39;t anything from last night, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nothing you did,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it about the costumes?&quot; Trevor asked, &quot;if you don&#39;t want to... you don&#39;t HAVE to wear a costume, like what we told you yesterday in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa blinked at looked at her cereal for a moment, swirling it with her spoon for a moment. She did remember the talk that she&#39;d had with the closest friends she&#39;d made in Moon Lake during her free period. Megumi, Alice, Jason, and Rob all shared their thoughts on the Halloween Dance and what they wanted to go as. Melissa had even stated some interest in going to the dance the, but she didn&#39;t know if or what Trevor would go dressed as.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not so much a costume issue,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and I suppose that if I were to go... it would be good to have a costume, though if there isn&#39;t one available... I would be more than willing to go, even if not in costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;ll come?&quot; Trevor asked. His voice sounded more hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;ll come,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I&#39;d love to go with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa thought she heard an excited cheer come through the phone which made her chuckle a little bit. That did seem to indicate Trevor was into her, which was nice. Though, given her growing feelings for Trevor, the thing she probably wanted to hear was to hear him say, &quot;I love you.&quot; But she rationalized that they were both young and real love didn&#39;t bloom in a matter of days and that in time that would happen on its own. In that time, she figured she&#39;d be able to figure out what she was seeing in her dreams. After a few moments, she heard Trevor respond in a calmer manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;When would you want to come by?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say... closer to noon,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;My dad isn&#39;t home right now, so I guess he and Ms. McCoy had a good night. But all things considered, it&#39;d probably be a good idea to hold down the form until he comes home. He should be back by then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say that they had a good time,&quot; Trevor said with a chuckle, &quot;the scent of arousal was pretty strong... It... it was really all I could do to not force myself on you, which would have been wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa found herself nodding, even though Trevor couldn&#39;t see that, &quot;I&#39;ll have to admit though... that I think even I could feel it... I&#39;m not sure I would have been able to say no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That still wouldn&#39;t make forcing myself on you right,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;Even if you want to be a werecow... it would have been wrong. I&#39;d promised you that I&#39;d wait for the right moment and that it would be when YOU are ready and want it. Not simply because I am aroused. It wouldn&#39;t be right or loving... nor would it be romantic. I promised you I&#39;d do it right and I will... because you are important to me and you look beautiful when you smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa felt herself blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... anyway, I can wait till noon when your dad is back,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;and hopefully he&#39;s happy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he is,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I&#39;ll see you around noon.&quot;</p>
