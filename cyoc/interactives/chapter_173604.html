<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer better known as Jen was busy making breakfast as she began to cook, a thud from behind her caused her to turn around to look into the living room of the cabin she had bought only a few months ago from her grandparents. Her future husband Jason, younger brother was lying on the couch a TV remote on the floor and a shotgun resting by the far wall, his girlfriend and her best friend where both asleep in upstairs. She walked into the living room to see that the TV was on and mute, it was of course on the news showing the massive breakout in New York City. <br />
She looked down at her phone and tried once again to give her cousin Barbara a call…once again it went straight to voice mail.<br />
“Please be ok, cousin.” Said Jen as she walked back into the kitchen and went back to work on breakfast. A few minutes later Jason came down the stairs. He was throwing on a button down plaid shirt, Jen grinned as she eyed Jason’s strong body with well-defined chest and arms, a leftover of his time in the military. He would have been called up to help, possibly could but that was unlikely because Jason had lost a leg in action. He walked perfectly fine with the help of a prosthetic leg but the marines weren’t going to call him up to fight unless they were really desperate.<br />
“Morning.” Said Jason as he rubbed his chin where a short brown beard sat over a strong jaw. <br />
“Morning.” Said Jen as she gave him a kiss, getting on her tip toes to kiss him. <br />
“Any news?” inquired Jason<br />
“Not good news.” said Jen as she looked at the TV, it showed that the red zone around New York and the red zone around Philadelphia had now merged into a single large red zone. The zone had also expanded Northward toward them, other cities around the world were not doing much better.  <br />
“I think we may need to consider heading somewhere else.” Admitted Jen “But I don’t know where and…”<br />
“And we know this area and have resources here.” Added Jason <br />
“Alright we will talk about it at breakfast, I am going to go out to the barn and make sure the camper is ready if we want to take that.” Stated Jason as Jen looked at him worried until he raised his shirt and showed a handgun in his belt line. She nodded as Jason gave her another kiss and headed out the door toward the barn. It was still semi-dark but more then enough for him to see the whole yard and the barn itself. <br />
Jason pulled his gun as he entered the barn making sure to be ready to slam the door if one of those creatures where there. Not a sound came from the barn as he opened it and flipped on the light to show a large camper along with a pull behind boat. The camper and the boat actually belonged to Jen’s grandparents but they had retired to Arizona when it became too hard for either of them to drive. <br />
He moved around the barn gun raised checking every spot one of those things could be and then once satisfied he began to work on the camper. He checked the engine, which was good and so where the tires. He walked to the side door and without much of a thought he opened the door. <br />
The creature was on him before he even knew what happened. He was slammed against the pile of firewood as a pawed hand shot down and grabbed his gun arm as another shot out and grabbed his mouth to keep him from screaming. His eyes widened as he looked at this creature, a lioness he had to guess and worse of it was smiling.<br />
“Hello Jason.” Said the lioness in a voice which sounded familiar, his eyes widened as he realized that it was Jen’s cousin Barbara. Movement from above the RV caused his eyes to flick upwards to see two more lioness, a lion resting on the roof of the camper and what looked to be a Jaguar women in the rafters of the barn, she was looking out of one of the air vets keeping an eye on the house. “Are you ready to join the pride.”<br />
He began to struggle but it was already too late as the two other lioness jumped down, one of the lioness judging by the fur color and the look of the now feline face had to be Barbara’s girlfriend Constance. They took either of his arms, tossing the pistol to the side, Barbara removed her hand from his mouth for a moment allowing him to get out half a scream but it was quickly muzzled as he was forced into her wet feline pussy. He tried to scream but Barbara held his head in her, reacting on instincts he opened his mouth to bite Barbara where he knew it would hurt instead, he found himself licking her pussy. <br />
Bite he had to bite, he needed to bite, instead he pushed his head deeper into his fiancé cousin new feline pussy. He did not even notice that they weren’t even holding him anymore as his tongue changed, becoming covered in thin hairs. He pulled back for a moment and cough as his teeth fell out as new fangs grew in even has his jaw pushed out into a muzzle, as this beard grew out forming a thick black lion main. His face was also becoming covered with black fur.<br />
“Well let’s make this fair.” Said the other lion as she pulled Jason away from Constance and forced him down onto the gravel floor of the barn. “I am Lindsay, welcome to the pride.”<br />
Jason wanted to push her away, if this was not unnatural it was cheating on the love of his life but as a male wasn’t it his job to help provide offspring to the pride. His shirt burst apart as his muscles grew in size as an unstoppable march of black fur came down his body. His arms grew in size and in power as he moaned a bit but was shut up when Lindsay kissed him as she worked his lionhood. His leg became stronger covered with black fur and then to everyone’s amazement the stump of a leg began to change. Bones and muscles grew as his missing leg was replaced with his new lion leg. He bit down a roar as he sent his seed into Lindsay, hopefully they made powerful new members for the pride but that would be a while coming.<br />
“Welcome to the pride.” Said Lindsay as she helped up the newest member to the pride, on his new returned legs. His new tail moving back and forth as he prepared to become a full member of this growing pride.</p>
