<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Russell rubbed his eyes and cleared the sleep from his mind. He found his father leering over him in bed. &quot;Get dressed and ready. Breakfast in 15 minutes, then we are going to work out&quot;. With that, the coach left the room. Russell felt a stirring in his groin. He looked down and saw he was tenting his blanket. It looked a lot bigger than it had before. Why was he hard? He had just came all over himself while he slept!<br />
<br />
Getting out of bed, Russell felt a bit sore. It was like his clothes and his bed had shrunk a but last night. He stood up and walked to the mirror, noting that he was definitely a couple inches taller. Looking down, he saw his tent in his boxers, with the large wet spot in front. He still couldnt believe he had had a wet dream! He had never had one before!<br />
<br />
He pulled the waistband back and saw he was a bit larger down there, and he had a lot more pubic hair than before. It looked like he had a normal amount for his age, now. Russell grimaced as he saw his cock and pubes covered in sticky, white cum. Even though it was just a tiny amount, he had never ever came before! Russell willed his erection to die down, which it did with some effort. This was all so new to him. He had never even got an erection before. He had only ever heard about it in health class!<br />
<br />
Russell noticed that his shirt was a lot tighter, too. He pulled it off and gasped. &quot;What is happening?!&quot;, he muttered in an ever deepening voice. His voice was now definitely lower than it was before, but still quite boyish. But that didn&#39;t shock him. What shocked him was that he saw thick, but sparse, brown hairs growing under his naval and around his nipples. He also had some in the center of his chest. They were very short and sparse, but it was apparent he was growing hairier! He counted about 5 or 6 in the center of his chest and 3 or 4 around each nipple. They were only half an inch or so long, but they were dark and thick.<br />
<br />
A quick check under his arms confirmed that he was now growing hair in his armpits, too. It was a very small amount of hair, and they were very short and wispy, but he had a feeling that whatever his dad was doing, this hair wouldn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
He heard his father about at him to come downstairs, so he hurried along. Russell ate all his food with tremendous gusto, even though the portions were huge. His body was ravenous for food. His father gave him some more pills and started including a protein shake with each meal. Russell gulped it all down quickly. &quot;Alright boy, ready for your workout?&quot;, he asked with a grin on his face. &quot;Yes, sir&quot;, he replied, sheepishly and a little nervous.<br />
<br />
Russell was exhausted. His father had made him lift and squat and do a great many exercises. Treadmills, barbells, dumbbells, machines, everything. As hard as it was, Russell was surprised at how much He could lift. Obviously, it wasn&#39;t a whole lot, but more than expected. His father kept yelling at him the whole time, pushing him harder, not allowing any room for breaks.<br />
<br />
He was as tired as a dog afterwards  and his muscles ached and were sore. He did see, however, that his muscles appeared to be bigger and bigger. Coach mentioned something about &quot;getting ready to play with the team&quot;, but Russell didn&#39;t know what he could have meant. Russell retired to his room smelling faintly of BO and sweat. He lifted up his arm, still shocked at the light wispy hairs under them, and was confronted with his smell. Uggh. It wasnt that strong or bad, but He had never dealt with body odor before.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on with my body!&quot;, Russell wondered aloud.</p>
