<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The little trout had the sudden realization that her mind had locked in. She was fully aware, fully alert, and retained all of her memories and experiences. Somehow, her shrunken down and simplified fish brain had managed to hold on to her self. The slow realization sunk in that she wasn’t doomed. <br />
<br />
Had she retained any ability to emote she might have given it away, but for the human watching on the other side of the water filled plastic bin, it looked like a hundred different moments he had seen an animal blank upon their final transformation.<br />
<br />
“Too bad, goddess. You looked like you might actually make it for a few seconds there. What a waste of a tight fishy pussy. Oh well.”<br />
<br />
She heard the vibrations of his hateful voice against the bin she was in. She felt clearer by the second. More aware. Less fish brained. She understood the words again. She stayed still, her fins undulating, her mouth opening and closing as she evenly breathed.<br />
<br />
He wheeled her on the cart to another room behind the chamber room. Her vision began to sharpen again. Her stomach did a twirl of excitement. She was changing back. The transformation wasn’t holding. She was changing back! She could feel it. All she had to do was play dumb animal, let herself slowly reverse, and she’d be okay.<br />
<br />
So subtle. So strangely pleasant. She could feel her living guts churning inside of her body as they began to grow and shift. Already, she felt bigger. Dammit! Would he notice?<br />
<br />
Apparently not. Tom, or whoever he was, wheeled her into a dark storage room and closed the door behind him. She was alone in the dark.<br />
<br />
She began to breathe faster and let herself grow. The gills were shrinking. The open slits on the side of her head were closing up gradually. She felt each pulsation. Each tremble. Each gentle little tug of her flesh and muscle and bone. Minutes passed and her tail fin touched the other end of the bin. Her snout bumped the front. She realized she was going to outgrow the container she was in soon.<br />
<br />
Her pectoral fins began to snake out on tiny limbs. She was getting her arms back. The gills had shrunken drastically now. Experimentally, she stuck her head out of the water and attempted a deep breath. Her nostrils hadn’t opened up yet. Her lungs weren’t back. Shit! She was getting too big for the bin! She still needed the water!<br />
<br />
Amelia stuck her tail out of the bin instead and kept her head submerged. On and on she grew, bigger and bigger, her feral state slowly wearing off. She felt the beginning of her feet regrowing from stems in front of her tail. To her utter delight, a sudden rush of bubbles emerged from her face and she felt her nostrils open up.<br />
<br />
She quickly stuck her nose up and inhaled. Fresh beautiful air filled her growing lungs. She took a deep draft in and let it sit. Her growth began to speed up. Wearing off fast now.<br />
<br />
A two foot long fish pulled her weak hands onto the lip of the bin and trembled as she raised lengthening growing three inch long arms up. The muscle was fresh and incredibly weak. She let out her breath and sat awkwardly half in and out of the container. Still too undeveloped.<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes, thank God, and let the reversal work. Gradually, she got feeling back in her little feet. It started to trail up her growing legs. Her hands buzzed next, and she could feel the plastic of the bin. Her spine began to grow more flexible. She could nod her head up and down again. There was a pop and her hearing returned, a little tinny, but getting better.<br />
<br />
The gills had shrunken into her neck, the vascular tissue rejoining her airway and sealed by their normal valves, and the openings began to fully close on her lengthening neck. She opened her eyes and was now panting with excitement. Three foot long. She had visible limbs again. She held up her growing fin-hands to her vision and let out a whimper. Voice wasn’t back yet.<br />
<br />
She sat up in the bin, curling her growing legs under her plump body, and sat back growing and reverting. Her fingers began to grow bone again. The transparent fins on her stubby arms began to grow blood vessels, nerve, and muscle fibres. Even in the dark, she could see the bright red of flesh and blood returning through the clear skin. A quick glance down to her fragile feet revealed the same process.<br />
<br />
Her pussy began to return. She smiled warmly, feeling her clit bulge out as a tiny dot between her emerging lips. That felt exceptionally good. Her round oval fish body was turning back into a female torso. Scales on her front began to turn back to nipples. Her breasts began their slow return.<br />
<br />
Too big for the container now. She was spilling out of it. Carefully, she stood on her tiny legs, which were struggling to keep up to her fast changing body, feeling them nearly collapse under her weight. She let them increase to a point of holding her before she came out of her hunched over stance. Knees snapped back into place. Her long wispy fin-feet began to stiffen back into the familiar flippers of her toes.<br />
<br />
Bigger. Bigger. She was standing again. Almost upright again. Her top was growing quite a bit faster than her bottom and her tits were returning. She carefully saddled over the water filled bin and managed to climb down the cart it was on. She hit the floor and used the cart for balance. Three foot plus half. She was definitely more woman than fish now. Her tail had shrunk back drastically. Her ass had swollen in. All her curves and shapes were returning. Four foot. She was almost done. She could feel it.  The last missing parts were shifting into place. She felt enormous in size and stature.<br />
<br />
The last few changes locked in. Her breasts plumped back up like inflating balloons on her chest. Her height reached its normal 4’5” tall. Her proportions corrected. Her legs got to their proper length and thickness. She felt the jolt as everything evened out.<br />
<br />
Gasping, nearly an hour had passed since she had begun changing back. She looked around, in the dim light she could make out a supply closet and various chemicals. She let go of the cart, letting out a sigh of relief, and fell to the floor panting.<br />
<br />
Whatever miracle had allowed the process to reverse had restored her back into a fish woman again.</p>
