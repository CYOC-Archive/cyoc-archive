<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing within Tatsu&#39;s private sanctum, Yuriko fidgeted nervously as the celestial kitsune prepared himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been here.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one comes here, save myself,&quot; Tatsu replied. &quot;I come here solely to commune with the spirit realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko nodded, once more glanced around the area. The room itself was barren, save a small pool and fountain. Marble columns lined the walls with small windows allowing light to filter into the room. If Yuriko didn&#39;t know better, she would think this small room belonged to a Greek deity.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kind of..empty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not meant to be decorated Yuriko Harris,&quot; Tatsu grumbled. &quot;Now focus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko did as she was told, a seat across from Tatsu. Slowly the celestial kitsune withdrew his sword, laying it between the pair. &quot;One of the powers of the Dragon&#39;s Tongue allows the wielder to visit the spirit realm,&quot; Tatsu began. &quot;Rarely, the wielder is permitted another soul with them, however, as I said before you are to stay by my side once there. Are we clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko nodded, Tatsu now instructing the young wizard as he made a series of motions with his hands. &quot;Do as I do Yuriko, and then gently place your hands upon the blade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko now watched Tatsu carefully, mimicking the kitsune&#39;s every move. Taking a breath, the pair laid their hands upon the blade. Yuriko gasped as she felt an energy like an electric bolt surge through her body. Yuriko&#39;s head felt as if it was going to explode, her vision blurring before feeling as if she was falling.<br />
<br />
Gasping, Yuriko sat up, confused by her surroundings. Gone was the sanctum of Tatsu. In its stead was a rolling meadow with long grass, a gentle breeze brushing Yuriko&#39;s cheek with a massive forest of trees perhaps 50 feet away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The spirit realm.&quot; Tatsu replied.<br />
<br />
As Yuriko looked to ask another question, Tatsu raised his hand pointing towards the treeline. Slowly two kitsune figures now emerged from the forest. One, an eight tailed vixen perhaps Yuriko&#39;s height, sporting pink hikama and a large eight tail male sporting an eyepatch and a green hikama.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are they?&quot; Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akane and Isamu,&quot; Tatsu said. &quot;The eighth and seventh wielders of the Dragons Tongue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko watched as the two spirits now moved towards them, both bowing before the celestial kitsune. &quot;Lord Tatsu,&quot; Isamu replied, before casting Yuriko a curious look. &quot;I see you have a companion with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Yuriko Harris, Isamu,&quot; Tatsu stated. &quot;A wizard and future master to The Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This girl is the one who will train Darren McKenna?&quot; Isamu asked in surprise. The kitsune now rubbed his chin thoughtfully, carefully studying the young woman. &quot;You most certainly are not what I was expecting,&quot; he said. &quot;I was expecting someone...more powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuriko is quite powerful Isamu,&quot; Tatsu retorted. &quot;She is one of the few wizards who is skilled in the art of psionics. She is a natural in both the arcane and mental schools of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Isamu said softly, still eyeing Yuriko carefully. &quot;I will take your word on that Lord Tatsu. Now, how can we help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are looking to contact a specific spirit,&quot; Tatsu said. &quot;A human wizard who was murdered years ago. Yuriko has several questions she needs answered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately there are no human spirits within this part of the spirit realm.&quot; Isamu replied. &quot;In fact, trying to venture to other portions can be quite dangerous for those unfamiliar with the spirit realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not impossible.&quot; Akane interrupted.<br />
<br />
Isamu and Tatsu now glanced at the vixen. &quot;What are you talking about Akane?&quot; Tatsu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Traversing the spiritual realm can be dangerous, but I know someone here who can safely escort us.&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And who could possibly do that?&quot; Isamu scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yasukazu,&quot; Akane smirked. &quot;The sixth wielder. He was your former master was he not Isamu?&quot;<br />
<br />
Isamu fidgeted in place, a worried expression crossing his vulpine face. &quot;Y..yes,&quot; he stammered. &quot;B..but he&#39;s quite busy. I..I doubt he would wish to be disturbed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He would love to help,&quot; Akane smirked. &quot;Let&#39;s go ask him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isamu gulped, nodding before asking Akane to lead the way. As the two former wielders now acted as guides, Yuriko and Tatsu trailed behind. Watching the two spirits, two things became very apparent to the young wizard. Isamu thought very highly of himself and Akane couldn&#39;t stand him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s up with those two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isamu is a very powerful warrior,&quot; Tatsu explained. &quot;During his time the protector of the kitsune, he won many a battle. You could say he was a celebrity amongst our people. I trusted him completely and had a good working relationship with him when he led my army.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No offense, but he seems like a pompous ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tatsu stifled a laugh, quickly composing himself. &quot;Isamu is prideful and confident in his abilities,&quot; he stated. &quot;Perhaps a bit too over confident. He died during the First Kitsune Civil War.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about Akane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She succeeded Isamu after his death,&quot; Tatsu smirked. &quot;Quite unexpectedly. I have known her since she was a young one tail. Akane worked harder than any other warrior to earn her place within the army. Isamu...was old fashioned in his beliefs. He did not think vixens belonged in combat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did she succeed Isamu as protector if he was such a pig?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would not call Isamu a pig,&quot; Tatsu argued. &quot;He is quite chivalrous in his actions. Stubborn perhaps. Arrogant, maybe. However, he was a good general beloved by his people. As to how Akane assumed her position? There were none left worthy of assuming the mantle. So many died, including Isamu&#39;s chosen successor. Akane assumed the mantle, becoming the youngest wielder of the Dragon&#39;s Tongue at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko simply nodded, studying the pair of kitsune carefully. She still had so many questions about kitsune history. Already she felt her head spinning just learning of the wielders of the Dragon&#39;s Tongue. She could only wonder what this fifth wielder would be like. As the group now entered a clearing, Yuriko balked at the kitsune standing before her.<br />
<br />
Standing at average height, this eight tailed kitsune appeared old. Sporting a faded red hikama, stretched across a rotund body, he now stroked what appeared to be a long mustache, which contrasted his pale orange fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Tatsu.&quot; He smiled, Yuriko noticing the kitsune missing some teeth in his weathered face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Yasukazu.&quot; Tatsu replied bowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Tatsu,&quot; Yasukazu smiled. &quot;What a pleasant surprise! How can I be of service?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Tatsu and this human wizard are in need of your wisdom and skills master,&quot; Isamu replied with a bow. Yasukazu nodded, stroking his mustache thoughtfully. &quot;Tell me my old apprentice, what do they desire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are looking to speak with a spirit that exists within another realm Yasukazu,&quot; Akane interrupted. &quot;They need a guide though, considering the danger involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told her you would not wish to be bothered though,&quot; Isamu said quickly, furrowing his brow at Akane. Yasukazu simply chuckled, watching the two former wielders glare at each other. The old master now raising a hand in order to speak. &quot;Isamu I need to speak with Akane alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My lord?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me speak with Akane,&quot; Yasukazu said. &quot;I will accompany you on this journey, I wish to speak with Akane in private first. Please, retrieve my belongings from home for this journey.&quot; Isamu bowed, quickly heading off leaving Yuriko with Tatsu, Akane, and Yasukazu. The old kitsune chuckling softly as he glanced at Akane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why must you always argue with Isamu, granddaughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granddaughter?!&quot; Yuriko exclaimed. &quot;Wait, he&#39;s your grandpa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is,&quot; Yasukazu stated. &quot;And she always argued with Isamu. I never understood why though? Isamu was a strong, capable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a pig,&quot; Akane grumbled. &quot;And he never saw me as a warrior. In fact he never wanted me in the army to begin with! I trained harder than any male soldier. He refused to acknowledge my dedication or competence, instead favoring the males I fought side by side with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isamu is a product of his time,&quot; Yasukazu sighed. &quot;And he did recognize your potential. The problem granddaughter was your own ego. You knew how skilled you were yet lacked humility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ego!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Akane ego,&quot; Yasukazu stated. Akane scowled, causing the rotund kitsune to chuckle softly. Slowly he now turned to Yuriko, a smile plastered on his ancient face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akane always wanted to follow in my footsteps,&quot; Yasukazu said softly. &quot;To wield the Dragon&#39;s Tongue like her grandfather. However, no vixen ever wielded the blade of the kitsune, in fact vixen were not even permitted to join the military. Tatsu asked for an exemption after I spoke with him. Akane was....what is the term humans use? Tomboyish? More interested in fighting than being a proper lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sitting around sewing and cooking was a waste of my time.&quot; Akane scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother and grandmother never thought so,&quot; Yasukazu countered. &quot;Do you think they were, wasting time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not!&quot; Akane exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Yasukazu smiled, gently patting Akane&#39;s shoulder as he turned to Yuriko and Tatsu. &quot;I never had sons,&quot; he stated to Yuriko. &quot;Only daughters, who in turn had daughters of their own. Vixen’s were not permitted to serve in the military yet Akane wished to honor my legacy. Tatsu granted that wish when I lay on my death bed, allowing Akane to join when she became a two tail. Still, none expected Akane to become protector, the honor was never passed down amongst family. It was an honor given to our greatest warriors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say?&quot; Akane smirked. &quot;I like to surpass expectations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you have granddaughter,&quot; Yasukazu replied warmly. &quot;Come, if we are to find this spirit we should move quickly. The journey is perilous and I will need your.... tenaciousness Akane of we are to accomplish our goal.&quot;</p>
