<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter was written with ChronoSeth and Leezardman, who helped a lot with adapting my words to the story&#39;s style. Things may be running into two separate but converging paths for a while after this.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The white veil faded, leaving the trio in bewilderment. Teleportation, while providing easy means of travel, was rather different compared to other means. The various pairs of eyes gazed and scanned the surroundings that greeted them, deducing that they stood on a hill in the middle of the cloud forest. Aside from the one they now stood on, various other hills graced the landscape, peaking out above the sea of trees.<br />
<br />
Aside from being able to catch glimpses of other hills, they were able to see where the trees ended. At the forest&#39;s edge, mountains jutted up from below. <br />
<br />
Such a sight reminded Isaac of what the tall clouds back in his world look like, blanketing a good part of the sky. Compared to his own, the clouds of this realm contained much more intricate detail; yet one would barely be able to make out anything from a distance, as they blurred together. Thoughts rushed through the paladin&#39;s mind as he examined the cloud forest, not able to tell whether they were thunder or snow clouds.<br />
<br />
It was impossible to tell whether snow would lie at the mountain’s peak, from this position at least.<br />
<br />
“We’re not even that close to the actual mountain itself. ” Isaac glanced at Mary as she discreetly vocalized her annoyance. Returning his attention to the mountain, Isaac brought a finger to his chin, surmising that it would take at least half a day to reach the first plateau.<br />
<br />
“Alicia told me that she didn’t actually consider the mountain to be of great importance,” Nat informed the group as she pulled a piece of parchment from her traveling bag, unraveling it to reveal it to be a map. “This hill is actually an excellent spot because it leads to many other places of interest.”<br />
<br />
Familiarity graced Isaac as his eyes skimmed over the map. “Is that my map?”<br />
<br />
Looking up towards Isaac dumbfounded, a look of confusion graced Nat&#39;s face. “Alicia packed this map into the bag…?” <br />
<br />
“Then I guess it should be fine.” Isaac sighed, glancing at the map that drew itself before surveying the forest down below. Nat&#39;s words ring true; he could discern multiple clearings and paths nestled within the trees, just barely made out.<br />
<br />
“Which of these paths will be the fastest to the mountaintop?” Isaac&#39;s gaze returned to Nat once more as she examined the various paths that had revealed themselves to her, contemplating their next course of action.<br />
<br />
“It’s not that simple,” Nat replied flatly, face twisted in uncertainty. “The paths lead to different parts to reach the mountain, and there are animals, dangerous ones, that we shouldn’t risk encountering.” <br />
<br />
“That should be useful to me,” Isaac tapped his chest where a single bramble vine covered in black goop slithered out. “More beasts for me to absorb.”<br />
<br />
Nat looked away from the appendage, nauseous. Isaac took the cue to store away said appendage.<br />
<br />
“As much as I want the Sky King dead, that doesn’t mean I want the ecosystem to die along with him,” Mary stated sternly, glaring at Isaac with disapproval on her cloud face. “Seriously.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, fine, the mountain top we go...” The titan walked forwards, ready to brave the forest. Isaac felt his back shift as attempted to summon his wings.<br />
<br />
Only to feel it writhe and roil, as if the concept of wings were never his to create.<br />
<br />
Neck craning to look over his shoulders, Isaac witnessed as the materials he had summoned to create the wings were flailing and slithering around aimlessly as if they had no idea as to what they were supposed to do. Isaac tried to imagine a set of wings, but the thing that formed from it was more like massive leaves stuck straight onto his back.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Mary’s voice interrupted his attempts as she walked to Isaac’s front, her confused face apparent. <br />
<br />
“Are you trying to form wings?” Nat excitedly asked as she also went beside Mary, joy beaming from her. “Can you fly?”<br />
<br />
“I was supposed to be able to,” Isaac muttered as the leaves on his back deformed into clusters of vines, reabsorbed into his body. “They weren’t massive or impressive but they served their purpose.” <br />
<br />
<i>“Isaac, there is a problem. Come into the halo.”</i><br />
<br />
“Was that Dark Isaac?” Mary suddenly asked, snapping Isaac out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Who’s Dark Isaac?” Nat interjected, confused.<br />
<br />
Isaac willed his tail forwards, confirming his worries. The heart-shaped tip that had adorned his tail was gone, leaving a jagged blade instead.<br />
<br />
“I have to check something, excuse me for a few moments.” The titan quickly sat onto the cloud hill in a meditative pose before the cyan rings over black orbs faded into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Both of them looked to Isaac’s form, as still as a statue made of composite materials. Mary, however, was unamused.<br />
<br />
“They’re saying something about a succubus...” Mary muttered lowly, scrying the bond to hear what was discussed inside the titan’s mind. “Rieletta?”<br />
<br />
“Wait you can read his mind?!” Nat screamed in excitement, jumping on her heels. “How?!”<br />
<br />
“There was this bond forced on me by Slar.” Mary fumed at that thought. “Now I can’t go too far from Isaac.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Nat stared at Mary to the point that it was awkward. “Sounds unfortunate.”<br />
<br />
“Wait here.” <br />
<br />
Nat was stunned into silence as she watched Mary walk forwards and began to climb the titan, reaching for his halo. The moment the cloudwoman&#39;s hands touched the halo, her body fell limp. Surprised, Nat ran forwards to catch her, yet skidding to a halt as Mary&#39;s form fell straight into the meditating arms of the titan.<br />
<br />
All four of the titan’s arms closed around Mary, making it very difficult for Nat to extract her from their grasp.<br />
<br />
“What the heck just happened?” Nat asked herself, a question that held no answer in sight.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Isaac?”<br />
<br />
Mary surveyed the world constructed within Isaac’s mind for her comprehension, searching for the owner. <br />
<br />
“Isaac, where are you?!” Mary called out, walking on the silver path that was the halo. She went nearer to the lips of the pit, witnessing the most recent changes to it. Watching the mass writhing below made her sick, prompting her to turn around.<br />
<br />
“Isaac, show yourself right now,” Mary demanded in such a cold tone it sent shivers, as witnessed by the black clouds shifting rapidly. “I’m not amused.”<br />
<br />
<i>”I can’t.”</i> The warbled voice was echoing around her, the direction coming from everywhere at once.<br />
<br />
“Why?” Mary questioned, feeling for the bond and following it. “Is it because it’s different?”<br />
<br />
There was a feeling of uncertainty, of fear. Mary picked it up quite easily. Within the halo, she was unable to see Ilvir or the ghost-like Dark Isaac.<br />
<br />
“...As you wish.” The voice echoed, closer and clearer.<br />
<br />
And Isaac’s new form materialized right in her field of vision. Mary’s heart skipped a beat upon gazing at the demon. Her mind whited out in fear of the incomprehensible being that had materialized in front of her, to the point that she didn’t notice herself walking backward.<br />
<br />
“Mary, watch out…!” Isaac’s warbled voice called to her, but his outstretched hand evoked another round of fear straight into her heart.<br />
<br />
“AH!”<br />
<br />
<br />
The world turned upside down as she lost her footing, plummeting and sliding down the slippery walls straight into the writhing mass down below, immediately disappearing into the folds.<br />
<br />
“MARY!” Isaac rushed to the pit, quickly glancing back at both Ilvir and Dark Isaac. “I have to save her!”<br />
<br />
“She’s falling into the body, into my domain.” Dark Isaac’s warbled voice muttered, apathetic.<br />
<br />
“Ilvir! Take control for now!” Isaac stood up straight, ready to jump for the first time into the world that is his body. Isaac glanced towards Dark Isaac. “You need to help me.”<br />
<br />
“As you wish, Isaac.” Dark Isaac whispered as he faded from view, a sly smile hidden beneath a veil of darkness as he disappeared from the halo.<br />
<br />
“Isaac-” <br />
<br />
“Ilvir, I trust you for this. Please,” Isaac gazed pleadingly to Ilvir, asking for him. “Protect Nat for me.”<br />
<br />
“I… I will.” Ilvir watched as Isaac nodded with a serene smile on his demonic face before he jumped into the pit. <br />
<br />
Ilvir couldn’t speak another word as he was suddenly staring at Nat, Isaac’s massive form conforming to his control. He looked down to see all four of Isaac’s arms protectively encasing Mary. <br />
<br />
“Isaac?” Nat’s voice called out hesitantly, and Ilvir took a moment to realize that she was calling him.<br />
<br />
“Y… yes, it’s me.” Ilvir glanced to the face of Nat, and then to Mary. Dread and a bit of lust surged into his heart, or Isaac’s heart.<br />
<br />
“GAH!” Ilvir groaned as he felt firsthand what Isaac had to endure. Chirp’s suckling was <i>euphoric</i>.<br />
<br />
“Isaac, are you alright?” Nat’s worried voice asked him.<br />
<br />
Asked Isaac, not him. <br />
<br />
<i>”How am I supposed to act like Isaac?!”</i></p>
