<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So, as Jay was plowing away behind Sean who was down on his hands and knees, Jay decided to play with Sean a bit more. After all, Sean had said that he wasn't into fucking guys, only girls. But Jay was shoving his cock in and out of Sean's eager pussy.  Jay figured it was time to have some fun dominating this muscle bound pussyboy. <br />
<br />
So, as Sean began to moan more fervently, saying, &quot;Oh, yes, yes, I'm almost there...!&quot;, Jay paused. He shoved his cock up all the way into Sean's pussy but then stopped moving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't stop,&quot; Sean begged. &quot;Just a little more!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, Sean,&quot; Jay said. &quot;I just remembered that you said you weren't interested in guys. You don't want a guy's dick in your pussy, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... no...,&quot; the confused Sean replied, trying to thrust his hips back on Jay's cock in hopes of finishing himself off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I don't want to do anything you don't want me to do,&quot; Jay told Sean. &quot;Since you don't like fucking guys, I guess I should stop, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please...,&quot; Sean begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you liked being fucked by guys, I guess I'd continue,&quot; Jay said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I, uh, I do,&quot; Sean replied hastily, trying to say anything to get Jay just to continue a little more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? What do you like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like... I like being fucked by guys,&quot; Sean murmured, in a state of erotic frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Louder please, I couldn't hear that,&quot; Jay said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I LIKE BEING FUCKED BY GUYS!&quot; Sean yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you like guy's dicks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I LIKE GUYS' DICKS! Just please, fuck me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you like to suck guys' dicks too?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, I LIKE TO SUCK DICKS!&quot; Sean replied, eager to say anything Jay wanted just to get him to start fucking him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You hear that, Dan?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure did,&quot; Dan said, and knelt down in front of Sean. Dan placed his dick head right in front of Sean's lips. &quot;Is it really true? You want to suck my dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean hesitated, so Jay slid his cock back out a bit and then in again, just once, reminding Sean what Jay had to offer. Sean moaned. &quot;Suck his cock,&quot; Jay suggested, &quot;and I'll keep fucking you.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all Sean needed to hear. He opened his lips and moved his head forward a bit to take Dan's dick into his mouth. &quot;Oh, yeah!&quot; Dan said as Sean started to suck on Dan's dick, becoming more and more motivated as Jay began thrusting his cock back in and out of Sean's pussy. Sean couldn't believe it had gotten this far. He had never so much as thought about sucking or fucking a guy before today, and now he was doing both!<br />
<br />
Dan grabbed Sean's head and took control, making Sean's mouth work at the rate and speed that Dan wanted. Sean quickly stopped paying much attention to Dan's dick (especially now that he didn't have to, since Dan was in control) because his thoughts were focused on the fucking he was receiving from Jay. It wasn't long before Jay had Sean squirming in pleasure. Sean was so close to coming, he forgot about everything else. He opened his mouth wide to moan in pleasure, but that meant that Dan's dick fell out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep your mind on the job,&quot; Dan insisted, as he placed his hard cock back in Sean's mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Sean replied and went back to work, sucking Dan's dick with more attentiveness, letting it slide in and out of Sean's mouth, just as Jay's cock was sliding in and out of his pussy... in and out, in and out, building up to the moment, building, buildling... Oh, oh, oh.... OH, YES!  Sean finally came and couldn't believe how good it felt, even if it was the first time he'd ever come with one cock in his mouth and another in his pussy. It was... it was like this was how it was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
But just because Sean came, that didn't mean it was over. Jay kept fucking Sean and Sean realized that the pleasurable feelings were like waves, sinking lower now that he had come but soon to rise again to another crescendo. He had never continued to be pleasured after an orgasm before, so he didn't realize that it could just continue like this. But having already had an orgasm, Sean could focus more on other things... like Dan's dick in his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, suck it! Suck that dick!&quot; Dan told him, and Sean did his best to comply. It was strange; Sean felt like he knew exactly what parts of Dan's dick to focus on, as if he knew what it felt like to have a dick. But that was crazy; Sean had always had a pussy, right? It was odd though; Sean had never known a pussy could feel this good before today. <br />
<br />
Dan continued to talk to Sean, saying things like, &quot;Yeah, you like my cock, don't you? You're a good little cocksucker!&quot; It was wrong, but being talked to like that was actually starting to excite Sean. He could feel a second orgasm building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, I'm gonna come,&quot; Jay said from behind Sean, and the thought that Sean's buddy Jay was going to come thanks to Sean's own pussy... that was enough to push Sean over the edge. So, as Jay quickened his pace and then finally shot his load inside Sean's pussy, Sean felt his second orgasm building until he virtually exploded. Sean was so distracted by his and Jay's orgasms, he hardly noticed as Dan stopped talking and just started grunting, &quot;Nnh, nnh, oh, oh, oh... YEAH!&quot; And Dan came too, his spunk shooting into Sean's mouth. Sean tried to pull away, but Dan just pulled Sean's head closer so that his nose was up against Dan's pubic hair, with Dan's dick continuing to shoot his load in Sean's mouth, forcing Sean to swallow. Finally, Dan was done, so he let go of Sean's head and pulled out, with a stray dribble of semen landing on Sean's face. Jay also was pulling out, his cock covered with Sean's pussy juices and dribbling semen.</p>
