<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Tad meet with his maternal grandparents and enjoyed their stories, even if they embarrassed his mother, Agent Theodore Green&#39;s search for justice for Jeff Decker&#39;s murder continued, though he had gotten most of what he do in Moon Lake accomplished. Some of it was essentially a dead end as Lionel Ulysses had apparently lost contact with Moon Lake after he left the town, though it wasn&#39;t a complete defeat for him. Lionel Ulysses&#39; parents had apparently watched in shame as their son fell into crime. They had tried their best to try and get him back on the right path, but had failed as sank into drug use and gang activity. What they reported went a bit further than what the police chief had told him, concerning Lionel Ulysses&#39; official record, but Theodore put that up to his parents being able to follow him a bit more closely than the law would. <br />
<br />
After all, many of Dillinger&#39;s girlfriends supposedly knew a far bit about that gangster&#39;s plans in the thirties, far more than what J. Edgar Hoover would have wanted people to know. And Dillinger was ultimately caught, and shot, because one of his girlfriends ended up turning into an FBI informant. Though, from what Theodore remembered from his own training at Quantico, he didn&#39;t think that Lionel Ulysses&#39; parents fit what he found to be the same MO as the &quot;lady in red&quot; from the last action that Dillinger had been involved in. They seemed disappointed and even hurt by how far their son had fallen, which was understandable. Parents never stopped loving their children, regardless of what they did. Theodore put his mission as to get justice for the Decker family, which would hopefully give them comfort and maybe an opportunity for the Ulysses family to try and talk to their son. He&#39;d have to see what he could do with regard to visitation rights after Lionel Ulysses had been caught.<br />
<br />
However, while that meant he had his official business done in Moon Lake, he had a few personal missions to get done before heading back to Seattle for tomorrow&#39;s ambush, assuming Lionel Ulysses was still meeting whatever gang he had joined every Sunday. Some related to letting the Decker family know about the leads and that he might be able to get justice for them and the rest related to his own retirement issues. For the moment he was on his way back to Moon Lake&#39;s Town Hall to discuss with the Town Chancellor as the Chief of Police had mentioned earlier. Though he was on the phone with the Seattle Field Office as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know it&#39;s vague,&quot; Theodore said slowly, &quot;but it&#39;s the only lead we have at the moment. If you have ANY files on activity... or contacts with the Seattle Police to see what they might have noticed, we might be able to get a lead on a guy that murdered a Marine to defend his drug lab.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be a lot of red tape, as the Seattle Police won&#39;t see your case as truly superseding their jurisdiction,&quot; the agent in Seattle answered over the phone, &quot;not without exact evidence... which you even said you don&#39;t have. And picking up random gang members on our own will only alert them if there is a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but surely there have been some things that the field office there has noticed?&quot; Theodore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but not much, and certainly not enough to have hard evidence on your suspect,&quot; the agent in Seattle commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Seattle PD will have more,&quot; Theodore commented, &quot;and their warrants for Lionel Ulysses on other drug charges are still open. Maybe see if they might be willing to cooperate from that angle. We share what we have with them and they share what they have with us. If need be, they can even be the leading units for the arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sir,&quot; the Seattle agent spoke, &quot;when can we expect you back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About an hour at most, I think,&quot; Theodore answered, as he pulled up in front of Moon Lake&#39;s town hall, &quot;I have a few small side missions to get done here in Moon Lake before I join you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he climbed out of his car and hung up. He didn&#39;t have much left that he could do in Moon Lake, but figured a visit with Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor might give him some window for dealing with his own private issues with Marci, namely that until he was a were, the two of them could not be together in EVERY possible way. He made his way into the building, checked room list that was posted and then quietly made his way up onto the building&#39;s second floor. Once there, he made his way to a door that was labelled: &quot;Town Chancellor: Samantha Twist.&quot; He found a lone woman, with a name plate on her desk was different from the name on the door. He assumed this woman was a secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, sir, can I do something for you?&quot; the woman, Sherri, said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am Agent Theodore Green with the FBI, I would like to speak with Samantha Twist about some personal matters,&quot; Theodore spoke calmly, &quot;Is she in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sherri looked up and actually stood up as she noticed him more closely. She quickly made her way toward the door and said, &quot;Hold on a moment please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore watched as she disappeared into a side door, which was likely the door to Samantha Twist&#39;s actual office. He remained out in the secretary&#39;s office for a few moments before the door opened again. Sherri came out and moved to sit at her desk while a blond haired and professionally dressed woman stood in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Green?&quot; Samantha Twist spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are Samantha Twist?&quot; Theodore asked as he held out a hand politely and waited for her to nod. She did so as they shook hands. As they did so, he continued, &quot;I believe I&#39;ve gotten all that I can here in Moon Lake for the moment, but wished to speak with you on some personal matters before I left for Seattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha slowly nodded, &quot;very well, come on in. We can talk in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore followed her into her office, and while Samantha was walking around her desk, Theodore was digging through his wallet. He eventually found a photo from his and Marci&#39;s wedding and managed to pull it out to hand to Samantha. As he sat down, he looked to see her looking to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what can I do for you?&quot; Samantha asked carefully.<br />
<br />
Theodore wasted no time and handed Samantha his photograph to her. She blinked as she looked to the photo of Theodore and Marci together,  and noted the very light blonde hair that Marci had. The hair was so light that was very nearly white.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I met with your chief of police he made mention that Moon Lake is something of a sanctuary for those different from the rest of the country,&quot; Theodore spoke slowly, &quot;and I would hope he is correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded, as Chief O&#39;Hara had let her know about her interaction with Theodore Green. Apparently the man was married to a werecat, but the two had not consummated their marriage, as the female only strain of the were-virus in werecats would likely kill him. He was likely looking for some help in dealing with that issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I to trust that he was right, that most of the people in Moon Lake are some kind of were-creature?&quot; Theodore asked.<br />
<br />
Samantha blinked and nodded, &quot;Yes. Of many kinds. I was told that you were thinking of moving here with your wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When we retire... or maybe rather when I retire and she has to for her own cover,&quot; Theodore said slowly and pointed to the photograph, &quot;my wife... Marci... she is a werecat. She&#39;s bisexual and transforms into... I believe she told me her specific breed is a Turkish Angora.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded. Her own instinctive knowledge of werecats and the animals they were connected to, the domestic house cat, let her know on how werecats were often based on different breeds of house cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;We met while she was in Law School and I was finishing up from the FBI&#39;s academy at Quantico,&quot; Theodore explained, &quot;the man she was dating, was a... a normal, as she&#39;s called it... and wanted to have sex with her, not knowing what she was. She refused for fear of the werecat strain of the virus or curse or enchantment, however you want to look at it, and he went nuts. He tore off most of her clothing and when she got away from him... he grabbed a bat and tried to beat her senseless...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha blinked as Theodore explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just happened to be in the area when she escaped the house she was in and couldn&#39;t just let the guy attack her,&quot; Theodore continued, &quot;she looked so hurt... physically and emotionally by this, that I decided to look after her for a while after that incident. I began checking in on her, and at first saw it as giving her some protection from a jerk with no self control, but then as time went on... things began to grow between us. I began seeing her for more than just checking in on her. Even as I began working with the FBI and she passed the Bar Exams for Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two state&#39;s and the US capital?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She explained it as being prepared for whether or not she could be accepted into an existing law firm or settling into her own practice... or being employed by those states as their state district attorney&#39;s offices, and stay close to me,&quot; Theodore answered, &quot;especially as we grew closer. She was soft and kind... yet strong and personally confident... dedicated to what was right to helping people. It drew me closer to her, and in time, we began seriously dating. And while we never had sex, I found plenty in her personality to love, and still love to this day. We married... but because of certain...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m well aware of the issues that werecats can have when in romantic relationships with normals,&quot; Samantha assured him, &quot;Your wife didn&#39;t wish to hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore nodded, &quot;Yes, so while we married... we&#39;ve had to look around for a were-species that has both male and female members. Which has been difficult as many weres on the East Coast at least have been extremely careful, even with Marci doing the looking... I&#39;d probably wager that they&#39;re probably fearful that my position in the FBI would lead to their exposure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you personally feel on that?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly... conflicted,&quot; Theodore sighed, &quot;a part of me feels things could be done better if weres come into the open, as in pure theory, things like the 1964 Civil Rights Act could be used to protect weres from outright persecution... but at the same time, I don&#39;t want someone to draw a conclusion based off of Hollywood that weres are too dangerous for things like the Civil Rights Act to apply and order stave off attacks on people. If that happens... I&#39;d lose Marci, who&#39;s never attacked me, has never acted like a movie monster... who has been soft and warm... loving and tender.&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice drew softer and he looked down as he finished, his thoughts turning over to Marci. He never wanted to lose her and wanted nothing more than to be with her for the rest of their days.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if something happens and she is exposed or weres as a whole are exposed... I&#39;d do everything in my power to try and make things right... so that we aren&#39;t at each other&#39;s throats and can live together,&quot; Theodore continued, &quot;as I&#39;d presume the people here have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have,&quot; Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if no one is exposed, I&#39;d want my wife and her secret to be kept safe,&quot; Theodore spoke, &quot;which would include moving here when it comes time to retire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Samantha said slowly, &quot;you are very devoted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marci&#39;s always brought out the best in me,&quot; Theodore gave a soft smile, &quot;though... I&#39;ve hoped for a way that I could be with her in EVERY way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which could only happen if you become a were, yourself,&quot; Samantha said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marci&#39;s preferred a weretiger, but would accept any were-species that also has male members,&quot; Theodore answered, &quot;I&#39;m afraid that my present case in finding Jeff Decker&#39;s murderer to really go through with anything... but some contacts might be helpful, and when Marci and I get time off, we could make contact and try to arrange for our own future together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded, and suspected something like this was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any particular species?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Preferably feline, but having male and female members,&quot; Theodore answered, &quot;Marci&#39;s first choice would be a tiger... but if allowed, I&#39;d even accept any other were-feline that has male and female members.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;well, while I can&#39;t give you direct phone numbers, I can give you a list of those who are the various were species that you&#39;re looking for... including weretigers, werelions, wereleopards or werepanthers if you&#39;re looking for a melanistic leopard,  werecougars, and even male &quot;werecats&quot; if you&#39;re interested...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Male werecats? Marci said werecats were strictly female,&quot; Theodore commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Werecats are,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;male werecats are actually were felines that are based off of wild felines in comparable size to the domestic house cat, but like werecats like your wife, they are at least bisexual if not outright homosexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can skip that one,&quot; Theodore commented, &quot;I have nothing against gays and lesbians... never fully understood it, but I&#39;ve never had anything against them. It&#39;s not my place to tell them who to love, either... But I&#39;d prefer to keep my sexuality as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Samantha answered and turned to a filing cabinet near her desk. Theodore sat quietly while Samantha pulled out a printout which held a list of names and their were species on it. As he looked them over, he was sure that all of the species were the were-felines that Marci wanted or at least would accept. Samantha then wrote her own office number on the sheet, and said to him as she handed him the sheet, &quot;When you get leave, call me and come here with your wife and we&#39;ll go further with regard to helping you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore nodded, thankful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though,&quot; Samantha spoke as she pulled out another slip of paper that looked as though it would allow for signatures in duplicates on it, &quot;we&#39;ll also need you to sign on the bottom line.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is...?&quot; Theodore said as he took it and pulled a pen from one of his pockets.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a waiver in which you agree not to divulge anything that would relate to Moon Lake&#39;s were-beast population,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;with the understanding that if you try to expose us, we will have local psychologists declare you insane and that the exposure attempt was the result of that insanity. You may not want to do that, but the waiver is just another means with which to keep the town&#39;s secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Theodore nodded and signed, &quot;but you&#39;ll have nothing to worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
With that, Theodore stood up and shook Samantha&#39;s hand again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And perhaps if you could be of help to me...we might be able to kill two birds with one stone and let me get my work done regarding Jeff Decker&#39;s murderer,&quot; Theodore said carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Samantha wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let Jennifer Decker know that we now have a suspect and are pursuing what few leads we have,&quot; Theodore commented, &quot;the suspect, Lionel Ulysses might come through Moon Lake, and she sees him and recognizes him anywhere... that she should call the local police. Assure her that we are making progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that,&quot; Samantha nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Theodore spoke as he turned to leave, but before he went through the door, he turned back, &quot;for everything.&quot;</p>
