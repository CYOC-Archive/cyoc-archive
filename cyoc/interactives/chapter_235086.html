<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vandal&#39;s eyes gleamed with malicious glee as he pushed Jeff&#39;s head back into the wall, rendering him a silent, helpless painting once more. Jeff&#39;s vision split. He could still see the room from his bizarre wall-bound perspective, but there was also an eerie second sight—he could now see Vandal’s actions from the viewpoint of the canvas. He watched in horror as Vandal shook the spray paint can again, its rattle echoing like a death knell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let’s have some real fun,&quot; Vandal chuckled to himself. <br />
<br />
The fox began by aiming the can at Jeff&#39;s attire, coating it with a layer of gray paint. Jeff could feel it happen, an unnerving chill running through his immobile form as the paint seeped and transformed into dense, gray fur. His clothes seemingly merged with his skin, making way for the sprouting hairs. Muscles bulged beneath the newly-formed pelt, rippling and reshaping to a chiseled, powerful physique. Jeff’s mind reeled with the disorienting sensation, simultaneously feeling the solidity of his new musculature and the immobility of being a wall-bound painting.<br />
<br />
Vandal stepped back, his eyes narrowing with focus. &quot;Looking good, but we&#39;re far from done,&quot; he said, reaching into the painting. Jeff felt Vandal’s fingers grasp his sides, twisting him around as though he were merely a figure drawn in ink. The sensation of being turned was nauseating; his perspective shifted, and he could now see Vandal&#39;s hand delicately adjusting his new gray fur, muscles flexing involuntarily under the fox’s manipulations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect canvas,&quot; Vandal mused, aligning Jeff into the optimal pose. <br />
<br />
With another flick of the spray can, Vandal began detailing Jeff’s back, adding layers of fur with each deft stroke. Jeff couldn’t fully grasp what was happening, confusion mounting as the fox continued his malevolent artistry.<br />
<br />
&quot;What’s he doing to me?&quot; Jeff wondered in muted panic.<br />
<br />
Then, Vandal smirked, adding the final touch to his work. Jeff&#39;s anxiety spiked as he felt the cold tickle of spray on his lower back. Vandal deliberately painted a long, lightly furred tail sprouting from above his new, muscular behind. The tail grew, curling and twitching under the painter’s meticulous control, entirely beyond Jeff&#39;s influence. <br />
<br />
Vandal leaned in closer, his intent eyes studying Jeff&#39;s form as if he was planning his next sinister masterpiece. With a devilish grin, he aimed the spray can at Jeff’s lower torso and began to work on his groin. The cold spray made Jeff’s nonexistent skin crawl as Vandal’s artistic vision took shape.<br />
<br />
A shiny layer of blue paint coated Jeff&#39;s fur, transforming into tight-fitting leather pants. The sensation was grotesquely intimate as the fabric seemed to mold itself perfectly around his more muscular frame, accentuating his legs while still providing the illusion of flexibility. As Vandal continued downwards, he added a vibrant red belt with a vibrant purple belt-buckle, the colors stark against the blue leather.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, that&#39;s a start,&quot; Vandal murmured, admiring his work. He then moved on to Jeff&#39;s knees, spraying more blue leather down his muscular thighs and over his knees. Jeff would’ve screamed from the unrelenting sensation if he could, but his painted self remained frustratingly silent.<br />
<br />
Next, Vandal switched cans, shaking this one vigorously before applying it to Jeff&#39;s lower legs. Stripes of rich purple began forming around his knees, seamlessly transforming into segmented knee-length boots. The boots felt weighty and binding, a sharp contrast to the bare fur that now felt like a distant memory.<br />
<br />
With a satisfied nod, Vandal paused his spraying and reached into the painting again, clasping around Jeff’s shoulders to rotate him. The sensation was dizzying and surreal. Jeff felt like a marionette being effortlessly manipulated, yet he remained stiff and static, unable to resist.<br />
<br />
Now facing the opposite direction, Jeff had an uncanny view of his own half-finished transformation. Vandal continued his work, thoughtfully spraying blue leather over the rest of Jeff’s thighs and calves, adjusting every detail to his devious satisfaction. The purple boots, with their layered, armored look, spread further down, covering Jeff’s legs entirely.<br />
<br />
Vandal’s eyes gleamed with wicked excitement as he planned the next phase of Jeff&#39;s transformation. He shook another spray can, this one hissing ominously as he aimed it at Jeff&#39;s back. With precise, deliberate strokes, Vandal began to paint a purple and black, box-like object, melding it seamlessly into Jeff&#39;s muscular frame. The new addition sank into his body, forming metallic, yet organic, contours that Jeff could feel as a foreign yet integral part of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let’s add some straps to keep that in place,&quot; Vandal muttered, clearly talking to himself as much as to the painted Jeff. He deftly sprayed red belts extending from the box, wrapping them forward in an almost intricate pattern that seemed to support and anchor the mechanical piece to Jeff&#39;s form.<br />
<br />
Vandal’s strokes then shifted upwards, adding blue leather to Jeff&#39;s fur starting from the newly formed box up to his neck. The blue leather snugly encased Jeff’s torso, layering over his muscles and making him appear more armored and robust.<br />
<br />
Next came the shoulders. A smirk played at Vandal&#39;s lips as he added large, protective purple shoulder pads to Jeff&#39;s transformation. They bulked out his silhouette, giving him an armored, almost warrior-like presence. Vandal didn’t stop there, however. He shifted his focus to Jeff’s right arm, his hand working with meticulous precision as he spray-painted it into a complex, mechanical limb. The metallic textures took on a life of their own, pistons and gears forming under Vandal’s artistic guidance, ending in a fully functional, mechanical hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now for the front,&quot; Vandal announced, flipping Jeff around once more. Jeff felt the disorienting twist, his painted perspective shifting as Vandal sprayed another box-like object onto his chest. This one was purple, comprising three distinct sections, the two on the sides balancing perfectly with a central piece that glowed a vibrant yellow. It radiated an alien energy, making Jeff feel even more alien within his own skin—or what remained of it.<br />
<br />
Finally, Vandal turned his attention to Jeff&#39;s human-like head. With a sinister grin, he started applying a new layer, transforming Jeff’s features step by step. The spray hissed as it formed a rodent face, complete with a pronounced muzzle and furred ears. Every detail was meticulously crafted until Jeff&#39;s new visage was that of an anthropomorphic mouse. His eyes retained their human fear but glistened with a newly painted gleam.<br />
<br />
Vandal stepped back to admire his grotesque handiwork, but he wasn’t done yet. He added finishing touches, spraying a fingerless glove onto Jeff&#39;s left hand and meticulously painting the fur so muscles appeared to bulge impressively beneath it.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go, a true masterpiece!&quot; Vandal exclaimed, eyes twinkling with pride in his work. &quot;You&#39;re really something now, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vandal, with a flourish, pulled Jeff out of the wall once again. Jeff’s newly transformed body emerged larger and more imposing than before. Standing at nearly seven feet tall, his muscular frame was sheathed in dense, gray fur. The purple and black boxes embedded in his back and chest gleamed ominously, and the red belts crisscrossing his body gave him a heavily armored appearance. His blue leather pants and segmented purple boots added to his intimidating look, and his right arm was now a sophisticated mechanical limb ending in a fully functional metal hand. The most striking feature, though, was Jeff’s new rodent face, complete with a pronounced muzzle and twitching furred ears.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt an overwhelming rush of strength and power coursing through him. He flexed, feeling every muscle move beneath his furred skin, and realized he was significantly stronger than he’d ever been. More than that, he felt an unexpected wave of rebellion, a fierce desire to not only test his new abilities but to challenge his tormentor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feels like... like I could take on the world,&quot; Jeff muttered, his voice deeper and more resonant than before.<br />
<br />
He spotted an aluminum baseball bat propped up against the wall. Grabbing it with his mechanical hand, he tried to bend it. To his astonishment, the bat yielded easily, twisting and crumpling under his grip like it was made of tin foil.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned his gaze to Vandal, who was now much smaller in comparison. &quot;Now what keeps me from just crushing you?&quot; he asked, his voice carrying a menacing tone. He advanced towards Vandal, his mind filled with thoughts of retribution.<br />
<br />
Vandal didn’t flinch. Instead, he casually grinned, &quot;Be my guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fueled by fury and his newfound strength, Jeff leaped forward and wrapped his powerful hands around Vandal’s throat. For a moment, it felt like he had the upper hand, his grip tightening with the force to snap Vandal’s neck.<br />
<br />
But then, as suddenly as flipping a switch, Jeff’s strength drained away. His body went completely limp, and he felt all power desert him in an instant. Vandal easily pried Jeff’s hands off his throat and stepped out of his weakened embrace, shaking his head with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try, but you don&#39;t know how to wield that strength yet,&quot; Vandal said smugly. &quot;Seems like you’re all brawn and no brains at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff lay on the floor, gasping as he felt his strength returning. His newly transformed muscles tensed and flexed beneath the dense fur, providing a forceful reminder of his capabilities. He stood up slowly, anger burning in his eyes as he faced Vandal again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better, big guy?&quot; Vandal teased with a smirk. &quot;Or should I say, feeling strong again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... strong,&quot; Jeff managed to say, clenching his fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good,&quot; Vandal continued, clearly enjoying himself. &quot;Do you understand what&#39;s happening, Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change... different,&quot; Jeff grumbled, struggling to form sentences that conveyed his complex thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, simple words for a simple mind,&quot; Vandal mused, tapping his chin. &quot;Tell me, Jeff, how do you feel about this new form?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff’s face flushed with anger. &quot;Mad. Want... stop... you!&quot; he growled, the frustration evident in his tone.<br />
<br />
Vandal laughed, a sharp, mocking sound that echoed in the room. &quot;Really? Is that the best you can do? You want to &#39;stop&#39; me? Such ambition!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fight... you... now,&quot; Jeff said through gritted teeth, stepping forward with menacing intent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so scared,&quot; Vandal replied with a theatrical tremor in his voice. &quot;But can you even describe what you&#39;ll do? Come on, give me your best shot!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mind raced, but his limited vocabulary chained his thoughts down. &quot;Hit... hard... break!&quot; he spat, feeling ridiculous but unable to express himself better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hit hard, break. Very poetic,&quot; Vandal mocked, shaking his head. &quot;Why don’t you go ahead and try? Maybe you&#39;ll break something, but it won&#39;t be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff lunged finally unable to bear the humiliation and anger, but found Vandal effortlessly dodging his strike. The exchange only fueled Jeff&#39;s rage further, but the limitation of his speech rendered him nearly incoherent in expressing his full wrath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think... win?&quot; Jeff shouted, eyes blazing with a mix of fury and desperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, Jeff? I don&#39;t just think it. I know it,&quot; Vandal sneered, his confidence unshaken.<br />
<br />
Vandal tilted his head, considering something new. &quot;You know, Jeff, you could stand to learn some better manners,&quot; he said with a wicked grin. He flicked his wrist, and Jeff felt an immediate and strange change sweep over him.<br />
<br />
When he spoke next, it was as if another person entirely was speaking. &quot;Mon dieu, what has happened to my speech? What is this... flowery tongue?&quot; Jeff exclaimed, his voice lyrical and refined.<br />
<br />
Vandal chuckled, seeming pleased with his handiwork. &quot;Ah, a gentleman now, I see. Perhaps we should make our little disagreement more... civilized. What do you say to a duel, mon ami?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff, unable to contain his newfound elegance, responded fervently, &quot;A duel, sirrah? Oui! I shall meet thee upon the field of honor. Let us settle this like true gentlefolk. I shall best thee for my freedom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vandal clapped his hands in delight. &quot;Wonderful! But let us make it interesting. A wager, perhaps? Should I win, you become my loyal servant. But if you win... well, mon cher, you get your freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed, but he agreed, buoyed by his newfound eloquence and confidence. &quot;I accept your terms, fiend. I shall prove myself upon the field of valor and leave thee humbled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vandal, ever the dramatic villain, pulled out his spray can once more and painted himself taller, bulkier, and outfitted in a traditional musketeer uniform, complete with a plumed hat. He painted himself a gleaming sword, which he wielded with a flourish.<br />
<br />
&quot;En garde!&quot; Vandal declared, pointing his blade at Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff, still under the impression that he was adequately equipped for the duel, fell into an exaggerated fencer’s stance. &quot;Prepare thyself, knave, for a thrashing like no other!&quot; he announced, lunging forward.<br />
<br />
Vandal deftly parried Jeff&#39;s unarmed strikes, his sword gleaming menacingly as it effortlessly deflected each attempt. Jeff struggled to maintain his balance, attacking valiantly but ineffectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your spirit is commendable, monsieur,&quot; Vandal teased between parries, &quot;but regrettably, your arms are not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s frustration mounted as he attempted to grapple with Vandal’s blade, yet without a weapon of his own, he was at a severe disadvantage. &quot;This cannot be!&quot; he cried out, heavily breathing, &quot;I... I am no match for thee in this fashion!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vandal finally disarmed Jeff with a masterful swipe, sending him sprawling to the ground. With a triumphant grin, Vandal pointed his blade at Jeff’s throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yield, monsieur,&quot; Vandal demanded, his tone carrying a victorious lilt.<br />
<br />
Jeff gritted his teeth, defeated but defiant. &quot;Very well, I yield, for now thou hast bested me. But mark my words, this day shalt not be forgotten!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Splendid!&quot; Vandal laughed, retracting his blade. &quot;Now, rise, my loyal servant. We have much to discuss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff arose, feeling a mixture of shame and indignant fury. Even with his ornate speech, the depth of his anger was clear. &quot;Lead on, master, but know that my spirit remains unbroken!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Vandal stood over Jeff, savoring his victory for a moment longer before making another whimsical adjustment. With a flick of his wrist, Vandal restored Jeff&#39;s speech once again, removing the archaic elegance and reverting him back to his rebellious mouse persona.<br />
<br />
Jeff scowled, feeling the shift in his voice. &quot;Alright, alright. I admit it, I’m beaten,&quot; he sighed, a hint of resignation creeping into his tone. &quot;Looks like I won&#39;t be getting out of this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vandal&#39;s grin widened mischievously. &quot;Well, who says we need to be enemies?&quot; he proposed, his eyes gleaming with a new idea.<br />
<br />
Jeff raised an eyebrow, taken aback. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked, slightly skeptical but also curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could work together,&quot; Vandal suggested, his voice dripping with coaxing charm.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed but his interest was piqued. &quot;And why would I want to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it,&quot; Vandal continued, stepping closer. &quot;With your strength and my... artistic touch, we could be unstoppable. No more servitude, just partnership.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff contemplated Vandal&#39;s proposition, grappling with his distrust but also recognizing the strange potential in their union. &quot;You think we could really work together?&quot; he asked, still wary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Vandal replied confidently. &quot;We complement each other, Jeff. Your brawn, my brains. It’s a perfect match.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed, recognizing the logic but still feeling the sting of his defeat. &quot;Fine,&quot; he said, finally. &quot;We&#39;ll give it a shot. But if you double-cross me—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need for threats, my friend,&quot; Vandal interrupted, extending a hand. &quot;It’s a fresh start. To new beginnings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated for a moment before taking Vandal&#39;s hand, sealing their dubious alliance with a firm shake. &quot;To new beginnings,&quot; he echoed, still unsure but willing to see where this new path would lead.Vandal’s grin widened. &quot;That’s the spirit, Jeff. Now, let’s see just how loyal a servant you can be.&quot;</p>
