<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Honestly, I&#39;m just tired from what we just did, is it okay if we just rest here till dawn, and I will show you around later?&quot; Hiranaf asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;m beat right now too.&quot; You said yawning, and curled up into a circle like a dog.<br />
<br />
Hiranaf walked over to you and curled himself around your back, and his head was next to yours now. &quot;I know this may sound odd considering we just met, but I feel like I love you Rosé.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I feel the same way, especially since I&#39;m going to carry our eggs pretty soon.&quot; You said smiling, and nuzzled Hiranaf&#39;s muzzle, and he nuzzled you back. The two of you drifted off to sleep moments later, your neck on top of Hiranaf&#39;s, and his body cuddling yours.<br />
<br />
You woke up later feeling well-rested despite the fact that you were laying on solid rock. You looked down at Hiranaf, who was still asleep, and you smiled. You got up and walked around again to stretch your legs, tail, neck, and wings. You looked around again, and for some reason something was off, but you didn&#39;t know what. Hiranaf woke up moments later, and did the same thing you did to stretch then walked over to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning my sweet, what&#39;s wrong? You look confused.&quot; Hiranaf asked tilting his head to the side slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what it is, but things seem unfamiliar. I know that I&#39;ve only been here for a short time, nd I know I&#39;ve been like this, but something still seems off about our surroundings.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
Hiranaf looked around, and he seemed to notice something was wrong with the surrounding area. &quot;You&#39;re right, what happened? I can&#39;t sense my brother&#39;s magic around the cave anymore. That and this cave seems different, there usually isn&#39;t much light like this, especially here.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you would know all things considered, but what&#39;s going on?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I want to try something.&quot; Hiranaf said approaching the exit to the cave.<br />
<br />
Hiranaf looked at it for a few seconds then cautiously stepped outside the cave, and he seemed utterly shocked that he could. Hiranaf then walked outside the entrance of the cave normally, and looked back to you with a shocked expression. &quot;R...Rosé the barrier that my brother used, his magic is gone. But we aren&#39;t in the forest anymore, we&#39;re on a hillside of sorts, and I see a mountain and grasslands. I also see a small village with humans in it.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see,&quot; you said and walked up to your mate. You looked out and saw a view of a mountain standing in the background of a vast grassland area. There was a village of humans, but it seemed like it was old, but people dressed like medieval peasants, and farmers were there, and farming the land. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we? I thought humans were more resourceful than this too.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but your right. The humans where we were had much more than this, and had technology that was infinitely more advanced than this.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, I think we may have been transported somewhere, and since the barrier is gone that means we&#39;re free.&quot; Hiranaf said and smiled at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings friends,&quot; a voice said, and you looked around then down to see a human standing and looking up at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello there human,&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings,&quot; you said and lowered your head to the humans height. You looked back to see a horse, and were surprised to see that you and Hiranaf were larger than it by at about twice it&#39;s size.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are newcomers here aren&#39;t you. I hope you don&#39;t plan on keeping too much of that gold in your cave there. You see a former member of your kind lived here, and was known for raiding camps, and doing the same to caravans, and traders. All that gold in there belongs to our village here, or to our king so technically it doesn&#39;t belong to you. I apologize in advance for any misconceptions.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
&quot;If the treasure hoard belongs to another then so be it, I personally have no use for it, and I take pride in certain things. One of those things is treasures, and how I acquire them. Stolen gold is for those who have too much greed, and if someone as high as a king wishes to take ownership of gold that was taken from him then so be it. I prefer to make my earnings in a more honorable sense by performing duties to those who need assistance.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have to find another cave?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw an empty one on the way here, seemed roughly the same size so you can live there if you wish. Just that King Perin claims ownership over what&#39;s rightfully his. Also I am required to see to that your kind won&#39;t harm anyone who occupies the village. It&#39;s the laws about having dragons live nearby a village, and I also apologize for that.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
&quot;As for the cave situation, I ask that you lead us to this alternate cave. If we are satisfied we will stay, but if not we will be dwelling here, but leave the hoard untouched. As for the law, you have my word that we will not harm any innocent people, you see we are mates, and we&#39;re planning on having eggs soon. So for that reason we must slow down our lives, and will focus strictly on protecting our hatchlings. However, I cannot guarantee that we will not harm someone who enters our cave when we have our eggs. I hope you can understand how protective we dragons are of our eggs, and I wouldn&#39;t wish for a death of an intruder to affect our family in the future.&quot; Hiranaf exclaimed<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, I will relay the information to the guardsman and they will probably send someone to confirm. For now please allow me to guide you to the other cave down the hill.&quot; The man said, and you and Hiranaf nodded to each other, and began following the man.<br />
<br />
You walked alongside Hiranaf as the man lead you to a cave that had a really large interior. You looked back to Hiranaf and smiled,&quot;I like it, it&#39;s certainly large.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If my mate agrees then so do I, if I may can I ask why you were up at the other cave with us. I mean besides us, you mentioned the gold was for the village, but did nothing besides lead us here. Why is that?&quot; Hiranaf asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just on a reconnaissance mission, I am armed too, but I was just confirming the location in accordance to a map that was drawn by the one who...took care of the former inhabitant in the cave who tortured us.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough, we&#39;ll settle down here, and wait for whatever guards they send.&quot; Hiranaf said, and the man nodded and walked off.<br />
<br />
Hiranaf then walked over to you inside the cave, and looked around. &quot;Well it is quite spacious, shall we build nests?&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know how to? I mean I don&#39;t.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been able to adapt to my instincts better than you have, so allow me to build your nest for you. In the meantime you should get used to your body more.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;ve been meaning to ask, how long is our lifespan exactly?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t age once we&#39;re at our prime, so we live for as long as we want until we are killed.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow really? That&#39;s definitely something to consider overall. Also thanks for building the nests, I really do appreciate it.&quot; You said and nuzzled Hiranaf again<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem, just do what you will until those humans arive.&quot; Hiranaf said, and you nodded.<br />
<br />
You lied down on your side, and examined your body for the first time since you transformed. You were marveled with the fact that you actually had breasts, and both of them were soft under your scales, and seemed to jiggle a little bit too, you sniffed at your breasts, and toyed with your nipples, both with your claws, and your tongue as you licked them out of curiosity. You felt pleasure when you played with your breasts, but you were used to it from your sex with Hiranaf. You then stretched your neck down to your vagina and sniffed that too, and it smelled like what you would expect it too, except it carried a slight hint of Hiranaf from his fluids.<br />
<br />
All during this Hiranaf built the two nests, and you watched as he carefully placed sticks, and pieces of cotton fluff from the plants outside in a way that formed a bowl-like structure. Afterwards you saw Hiranaf approach you holding a moose in his mouth that was dead. &quot;Here, eat this I know it&#39;s different than what you&#39;re used to, but it&#39;s something we do as dragons.&quot; Hiranaf said dropping the moose in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, uh thanks, I guess, you didn&#39;t have to do this Hiranaf.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do, it&#39;s something that we as dragons honor traditionally. Male dragons hunt for their mates while they take care of the young in any way they can. You can still fight, but females don&#39;t typically hunt unless they don&#39;t have a mate, so you would want to give others the wrong idea. I know it&#39;s probably generic, but it&#39;s natural instincts for us dragons, so please don&#39;t take anything too offensive. It&#39;s probably the only thing that is a gender specific detail for our species too, besides you have to feed them while they are teething, and protect the eggs too.&quot; Hiranaf said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I guess that makes sense then, but still thanks Hiranaf.&quot; You said nuzzling his chin.<br />
<br />
You looked to the moose on the ground, and stared at it wondering how you could eat it. You then turned to your instincts, and you stripped the animal of its fur then devoured what was under that without hesitation. Overall you didn&#39;t find eating the raw meat too bad, you actually kind of liked the fact that there was so much blood in your meal. You then licked your lips from what blood was left and disposed of the bones and the hide outside the cave, where you saw Hiranaf doing the same with a buck.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was it?&quot; Hiranaf asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd at first, but I kind of liked the blood taste to it.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I made two nests, yours is larger than mine, because your going to be laying eggs. But for now we should just wait for those guards that the man said would come to confirm that we aren&#39;t dangerous to them. Until then let&#39;s just talk, and after the humans leave we can have another session to fuck each other.&quot; Hiranaf said grinning<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, why did you need to spoil the surprise like that? Besides it doesn&#39;t sound sexy when you just say it like that, try being a little more dirty.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it, my sexy, sexy beast, later we can make lovely eggs, and we will have our second session of me licking your sweet clit, and you sucking my throbbing dragon meat, and then you can pretend you are a horse again while I ride you all night.&quot; Hiranaf said grinning and you blushed feeling a bit horny<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey, now you&#39;ve gotten me all excited for tonight, I can&#39;t wait until it comes, until you cum.&quot; You said with a naughty smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should wait though, and saver the moment when we&#39;re both ready.&quot; Hiranaf said, and you saw his dicks unsheathed<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s horny.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it&#39;s going to be that much better then for the both of us.&quot; Hiranaf said, and he sheathed his dicks.</p>
