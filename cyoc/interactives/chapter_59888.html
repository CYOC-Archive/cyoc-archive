<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff thought about what sort of profession he wanted to enter. Of the various choices, he narrowed it down quickly, and found one that sounded fascinating.<br />
<br />
He wanted to be a sniffer-dog-boy, and join the police force in that capacity. He could probably even help like a full policeman at the same time. He pictured himself, wearing a dog-boy vest with a badge on it, busting a drug ring. In fact, in addition to the acute sense of smell, he'd probably also be able to get some other enhancements that would suit a police-dog-boy.<br />
<br />
And so, he signed on the dotted line of the first form, giving his consent. Then he began to fill out the second form.<br />
<br />
The receptionist then asked Jeff to enter the room; she asked that Mark remain seated, as this was to be a private decision, even the owner wasn't allowed unless the pet requested it. Jeff glanced back at Mark, then leaned forwards and bounded into the office.<br />
<br />
<br />
Larry accepted Jeff's papers, and sat down at a computer, with a woman Jeff didn't know standing by his side. Larry introduced the woman to Jeff, but all Jeff really cared to notice was that she was one of the researchers. Larry began to key the details into the computer, turning to the woman when necessary. Then Larry began asking questions that were specific to the choices Jeff had made.<br />
<br />
Soon, Larry turned back to Jeff and asked him to look at the screen. Jeff examined the visualisation that was generated of what Jeff would look like, with markers indicating appropriate modifications to features. Jeff gave the OK, and Larry hit the button.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the main Chronivac emitter within the building activate as a wave of distortion passed through the building. Larry explained, even as the changes began, that TransDem had a special version of the Chronivac installed within the building, but Jeff was more interested in the changes.<br />
<br />
First, Jeff saw his nose grow larger, and he turned to a mirror that was off to the side, that Larry had arranged to have there for Jeff. Jeff watched, fascinated, as the lower edge of his nose turned up somewhat, and darkened to a reddish brown colour. He smiled as the edges of his nostrils became wetter. Jeff's jaws then protruded forwards ever-so-slightly, and without thinking about it, he let his tongue hang out of his mouth. He smiled again as his tongue hung comfortably past his lip, although not making it all the way to his chin without effort. He instinctively licked his upper lip and nostrils, then noticed the elongated canines he had been given.<br />
<br />
Larry explained features as the formed; Jeff would be able to eat raw meat, and those canines were sharp enough to tear into it... but he was still going to be omnivorous. Jeff detected an odour in the air, but couldn't determine what it was, only that it was somewhere to his left. Looking back at the mirror, Jeff noted that his nose had rounded out slightly, and that his nose had grown just enough to make his eyes tilt slightly outwards. The whites of Jeff's eyes were still there, but took up significantly less of his eyes than they had.<br />
<br />
Jeff then felt the musculo-skeletal changes start to kick in. His upper body bulked up somewhat, giving his upper body a shape more suited to wrestling or boxing. His lower body, instead, stretched out more, his legs and abdominal region growing enough to boost his height to about 6 feet and 8 inches... but then he naturally bent his knees and leaned forwards somewhat so that, at rest, he stood about 6 feet even. His feet were also longer, but less wide. He didn't need Larry to tell him that he would now be an exceptional runner, easily outpacing a human.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as a small strip of his penile skin attached to his body, near the base of the penis. It didn't go all the way up, but it did mean that Jeff's large penis pointed a little more upwards, and then outwards while flaccid.<br />
<br />
Larry asked Jeff to look at his backside. Jeff twisted, finding the movement significantly easier than it used to be, and looked back to find that his tailbone had pushed outwards a small amount. Smiling, he watched as it began to twitch back and forward. It wasn't a tail, but it was enough of one to distinguish him from a human, even from behind, body shape not withstanding.<br />
<br />
Jeff began to notice a soft humming sound, and looked around. It seemed to be coming from near Larry. Paying closer attention, he realised that it was the sound of the computer; he hadn't heard a sound until now, but he could definitely hear a high-pitched hum. Looking back at the mirror, Jeff noticed that his ears had adjusted slightly, and now had distinct points. He thought back to Spock from Star Trek, and realised that it looked somewhat similar... that is, until the points softened slightly, and his ears drooped away from his head a small amount. Turning his head back and forth, he watched as his ears shifted a little with each movement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Larry walked up to Jeff, and began to scratch gently behind Jeff's right ear. Jeff's tongue lolled out and he smiled broadly, showing his canine teeth. Then he again smelled that enticing scent he had caught earlier. Looking again to his left, he started to look around, trying to find the source of the smell. Larry laughed softly and suggested that Jeff look in the drawer he had zeroed in on.<br />
<br />
Inside, Jeff found a piece of steak. It was raw, and he salivated quickly at smelling it so strongly. He quickly associated in his mind the scent with raw steak. He reached out to grab it, but then paused and looked back at Larry, his ears stiffened and his tailbone twitching excitedly. With a subtle nod from Larry, Jeff grabbed the steak and started to tear at it with his canines. Ever bit of flavour from the blood was bringing more enjoyment for Jeff, and he began to swallow chunks of meat whole as he tore them off. As he finished the steak off, he rapidly licked up the blood on his hands with his large tongue, and then proceeded to lick up the splattered blood from the floor, finding himself more at ease on four limbs than he had previously.<br />
<br />
<br />
Larry opened the door, and Jeff ran back out to Mark, talking excitedly about how great the changes were. Mark looked Jeff over, then smiled and nodded to Larry and put Jeff back on his leash. Jeff kept talking about it on the drive home, about how he was going to be a police sniffer-dog-boy, and how much he wanted to try out his new body. When they stopped at the park, Mark pulled out a tennis ball and suggested that they play fetch. Jeff's face lit up and it was on.<br />
<br />
Jeff was definitely a lot faster. Mark threw the ball as hard as he could, in various directions, and Jeff managed to reach and grab it within one bounce, every time, sometimes even catching it in his mouth. Jeff was finding it a little too restrictive, and asked Mark if he could go for a run. Mark assented, and Jeff began to run around the large park lake. Mark couldn't help but smile as he watched his friend-turned-pet darting around the lake, sometimes stopping to smell or even taste things that caught his interest. A few other people in the park remarked on how beautiful he was, and Mark smiled even more broadly.<br />
<br />
After about 20 minutes of this, Mark decided it was time to head home. He pulled out a dog whistle that he had been given by the secretary, and Jeff quickly perked up at the sound, not realising that it was a higher pitch than humans could hear. Mark quickly bundled Jeff back into the car, and they headed home.<br />
<br />
Things got even more interesting once they got home.</p>
