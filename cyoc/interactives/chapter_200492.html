<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning Mandy had to set off to work. Since Chuck couldn’t dress himself without arms, she had put him in a pair of his size large tighty whities. She also opened the back door of their house so that he could go out if he pleased, and called off of work for him.<br />
<br />
With the house to himself, Chuck went outside and sat in a lawn chair behind his house. He could barely see through the white cotton of the briefs he was wearing, but it was enough that he could tell what he was doing. He couldn’t close his eyes, being that he didn’t have any, but he could choose to not see whenever he wanted, which was functionally similar. He chose not to see for a while so that he could focus on the sunlight and nice breeze flowing in.<br />
<br />
The paper boy, Will, was done for the day but was now riding his bike around the neighborhood for fun. He was riding down the street behind Chucks house and he looked over to that house, thinking about how Chuck owed him for last months deliveries. When he looked over, he saw a strange and lifelike statue of a hairy dilf’s lower body. If he didn’t know any better he’d have sworn it was Chuck’s body.<br />
<br />
Just then, Will saw the statue move. It put one leg over the other just as if it was a fully living person. Will had to get a closer look, and he had the excuse of discussing payment anyway. He rode his bike around to the other street which the front of Chucks house was on. He knocked on the door, rang the doorbell and even tried a not too high volume yell to get either Chuck or Mandy’s attention, all to no avail. He knew someone must’ve been home, because he had seen their back door opened from the other street.<br />
<br />
Getting ballsy, Will leaned his bike up on the house and walked around back to investigate for himself. The back door was still wide open and the male lower body was still in that chair. He could tell from this distance that it was a living lower body. It was even tapping its foot. He had no idea how this was happening, but he knew he was turned on.<br />
<br />
Will had always known he was bi. He wasn’t out to anyone, and despite the fact that he was far more attracted to men, he’d only had girlfriends so far. His dad was a macho man who regularly said homophobic things which didn’t help put Will in a better position to come out.<br />
<br />
Upon closer inspection, this lower body was definitely Chuck’s. Will lived for the days he got to check out Chuck who sometimes went to get the paper in no more clothing than his current body was wearing now. Will would know that underwear bulge anywhere. Only now, he could get as close as he liked.<br />
<br />
Will got on his knees and crept his face closer to the crotch of Chuck’s tighty whities, reasoning with himself out loud, “Just one kiss through the fabric, then I’ll go home.”<br />
<br />
Chuck heard Will’s voice and opened his metaphorical eyes. He saw his paper boy leaning in with lips puckered. He didn’t know if he should pretend to be a lawn ornament or something. Will did say that he would leave after giving one kiss, maybe he could just let him have the kiss and be on his way.<br />
<br />
Will’s lips met the fabric and he pressed them into the soft genitals. It actually felt kinda good for Chuck, but he was scared where this could lead and hoped that Will would leave now.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god I could actually feel his penis and balls through the fabric,” said Will in a horny tone, “Maybe I could just borrow this for a little while.”<br />
<br />
“Borrow what?!” Screamed Chuck internally, “My entire lower body??”<br />
<br />
Will dumped the contents of his large hiking backpack on Chuck’s backyard. Chuck watched in horror, wondering if his paper boy was gonna shove him in there. He figured it was time to speak up.<br />
<br />
“Um Will stop,” he said out loud this time, “It’s me, Chuck.”<br />
<br />
To Chuck’s dismay, Will kept on with his task. Chuck had a horrifying realization: Mandy hadn’t given him a real voice as his lower body, it was a voice that only she could hear. To everyone else, including this horny man before him, Chuck was nothing more than a man’s lower body with no ability to communicate.<br />
<br />
Chuck stood up, wanting to make a run for the house. Will saw what the dilfy lower body was up to, grabbed him by the hips and said, “Oh no sir, you’re coming home with me.”<br />
<br />
Chuck was terrified, but also, horny? Was the thought of this younger man taking him home and taking advantage of him actually exciting him? Chuck had always found men somewhat sexually intriguing, but since he was more attracted to women he had pushed those feelings aside long ago and decided that it was easier to live as a straight man. Curiosity got the better of him and he bent his legs, making himself compact enough for Will to fit him into the backpack.<br />
<br />
“That’s more like it. It’s almost like you wanna come home with me,” Will teased the half-body. <br />
<br />
Chuck’s penis twitched. The younger man was right, he was really helping Will abduct and probably rape him. The reality of the situation was sinking in. He had a wife who he loved! And more than that he was a man! With manly pride...right? So why did he want to be taken so badly? He would have some time to think about it in the darkness of the backpack in which he was just put.</p>
