<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was happy to have guests and in many ways was very happy to see Kumiyo again. When they&#39;d first met and he&#39;d provided the sample needed for her to become a Tylosaurus Dinotopian like him, he&#39;d assumed that things wouldn&#39;t go much beyond that. For while Kumiyo and her cousin had gotten a good enough education that they knew some English, he knew virtually no Japanese. They also had different career goals or work. Kumiyo and her cousin were largely waiting for their fathers to have their fishing fleets reworked so that they could help them... and the big thing would actually be to have houses built that could better accommodate their size, as while Kumiko and Ningen weren&#39;t the largest Animalians, they were still large, and Kumiyo was larger still. That would have them focused in the area around Hokkaido in northern Japan, while Ty had had his work as a lifeguard and &quot;shark patrol&quot; off the Florida coast near Skull Island and his Dinotopia Aquatica home. All of that was likely to keep them apart and would eventually see Kumiyo fall for someone &quot;closer&quot; to home.<br />
<br />
But they traded letters, emails, and even some video conferencing when they could arrange for messages and dealing with all the time zone differences between Dinotopia Aquatica and Heiya Island, and from there, something just seemed to stick in the back of Ty&#39;s mind that Kumiyo could be more than that. She taught him a bit of Japanese and managed to share some jokes about things that went on around Heiya Island, and maybe it was because Kumiyo was the only other Tylosaurus Dinotopian that Ty knew, but it did draw some interest. If only to hear from her and see her on his computer screen from time to time. Seeing her in person was a very pleasant surprise, and it was such that at first he barely noticed Kumiko and Ningen being there as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... do you three have a place to stay while you&#39;re visiting?&quot; Ty asked, knowing that visitors from outside Dinotopia Aquatica often stayed at one of the hotels in the nearby Florida city.<br />
<br />
&quot;We... we were hoping you would be a gracious host and fall in love with Kumiyo,&quot; Kumiko said with an obvious smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kumiko!&quot; Kumiyo practically shrieked and blushing through her scales, and this drew Ty&#39;s attention to the other two Animalians.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t get to meet Kumiko and Ningen all that much when he&#39;d visited Heiya Island, their silvery white coloring was striking. Though, he felt his cheeks blush a little bit, as to a degree, he&#39;d been finding himself more and more open to Kumiyo through their communications. For the moment, he tried to play it cool and not do anything that would sound desperate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I do have a fold out couch, I suppose I could share,&quot; Ty said slowly, &quot;Though, I&#39;m not sure it can hold three...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kumiyo could sleep with you,&quot; Kumiko pointed out, her grin unchanged and drawing another blush from both Dinotopians, which they didn&#39;t notice on each other as the two Orcas now had their attention.<br />
<br />
There was a silence for the moment and eventually, Ty tried to sidestep the issue between the two groups as he began to lead them in. In part because if they had no other place to stay, it&#39;d be best to share space with them and at the same time, he and Kumiyo had had sex after her conversion. So, it wasn&#39;t like things were all &quot;innocent,&quot; but Ty did want to be polite and in control of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure something will be figured out,&quot; Ty commented, &quot;and you two would be Kumiko and Ningen, correct? Kumiyo has told me a lot about you... I must say...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;ve never seen Orcas like us before?&quot; Kumiko nodded.<br />
<br />
Ty nodded to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;White Orcas are rare,&quot; Ningen answered, &quot;so, it&#39;s no surprise you haven&#39;t seen too many.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty nodded again and gave a small smile. He noted the two of them placed an arm around each other and traded smiles as well. It demonstrated their status as bond mates. He led them into the main entry elevator which took them into the first level of Dinotopia Aquatica. The group looked a bit amazed by the nature of the stone and hollowed out construction, along with the grotto at the bottom. The hum of the electric lights and air ventilators was the only other sound beyond their steps.<br />
<br />
“And that was why you converted?” Ty commented.<br />
<br />
“It’s why I converted,” Kumiko answered, “I was just very fortunate that my bond mate… Ningen happened to be a White Orca and that we became mates shortly after his uplifting.”<br />
<br />
“And Kumiko has taught me much… both about Animalia and Human society,” Ningen added, “it is… interesting to know that Humans operate in ways that are much like Orca… as hunters… though, obviously relying on tools and machines to aid them rather than physical strength.”<br />
<br />
“Yes… Human evolution lead to greatly increased brainpower for tool use and social behaviors to make up for the lack of strong teeth and claws,” Ty commented, “to some degree… I think that’s why a lot of people have converted to become Animalians. To merge the raw power that would come with the animal with Human intelligence and the base form. And which can be helpful.”<br />
<br />
“As Kumiyo’s told me you work as a lifeguard,” Kumiko commented while still looking about the levels that had initially been carved out by pirates looking to plunder Spanish ships and hide their treasure.<br />
<br />
“And shark deterrent, yes,” Ty nodded.<br />
<br />
“They must be curious and possibly nervous with you… something they haven’t seen,” Ningen commented.<br />
<br />
“Well… modern sharks may not have seen a Tylosaurus before me…” Ty commented, “but given that the first ‘sharks’ appeared in the Devonian period, well before the Mesozoic Era when Mosasaurs like Tylosaurus evolved, it wouldn’t be as though sharks would be incapable of responding to a Dinotopian completely. After all, sharks survived the meteor that wiped out all dinosaurs and most Marine Reptiles, including Mosasaurs.”<br />
<br />
“And for the most part, Ty hasn’t been employed to fight them,” Kumiyo provided some clarification for Ningen, “more to provide a sort of patrol and presence that would provide an early warning and potential deterrent to try and prevent attacks.”<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all interesting,&quot; Ningen said with genuine curiosity on how all that worked, &quot;though... I&#39;d ask why it&#39;s needed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Florida has various rivers, and many of the beaches that are used often aren&#39;t too far from towns and cities that were built ON those rivers,&quot; Ty answered, &quot;which in turn provides natural areas along the coast where many shark species may come in to lay their eggs or give birth to their young, depending on the species. And some Bull Sharks may even go UP the rivers at times. Thus, with many people and sharks in close proximity, there can be an increased risk of shark attack and the beaches in this area would like to hope that a large marine Dinotopian might be able to provide enough of a presence that sharks won&#39;t stay close to the beaches for too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods at that, and Ty then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all tired after a long flight and there will be some things to do before everyone can be settled in,&quot; Ty commented.<br />
<br />
The others nodded as they then followed Ty to his apartment. There was continued curiosity at how Dinotopia Aquatica, unlike the other Animalian colonies that had above ground shelters was all underground. But there had been a long flight, and they didn&#39;t have any other place to go. If Ty was to be accommodating for them, they&#39;d take advantage of it. Kumiko and Ningen were happy set up the fold out bed as a place for them to sleep, and as Ty slipped into the kitchen, he could hear the two Orca Animalians pushing on the springs and noting the groan of them as they did so. He thought he even heard Kumiko giggle at the sound. For Ty, though, there was some quiet nervousness on his part... and something he couldn&#39;t get away from as he looked into his refrigerator to begin contemplating on what to cook for dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if my cousin jumped you with some forward questions,&quot; Kumiyo said slowly as she came into the kitchen, noting that in places, Ty had put down some area rugs and the like in places.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem, really,&quot; Ty answered with is head still hidden behind the refrigerator door, &quot;I mean... she and Ningen have bond-mates for a while, now, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, pretty much since he was uplifted and converted Kumiko,&quot; Kumiyo answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s all going to be part of things that relate to Animalians,&quot; Ty answered as he pulled out a few packets of salmon that he&#39;d bought and had been saving, but now seemed like the best time for it, &quot;I mean... Animalians do have a higher libido, and those that have found their bond-mates have seemed to be insanely happy and wanting their friends to be happy. And because you and her are cousins and that she surely knows that we... well... you know... she wants you to be happy and that being with me would be a way for you to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty then turned to place the packets on the counter before turning to some of the other things that would be needed to prepare diner. He noted Kumiyo looking to him, and he fought the urge to simply scoop her into his arms and nuzzle her muzzle with his. He wanted to be a gentleman about things. Though, he did feel it best to be honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... I would admit, privately,&quot; Ty spoke, &quot;that a real part of me wouldn&#39;t be against sharing a bed with you... it&#39;s... well... you are beautiful. Your voice is cute when you laugh, and all of it... triggers some of the instinctual urges in me that are attracted to you as a Tylosaurus Dinotopian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, I feel the same,&quot; Kumiyo whispered, &quot;other than the voice thing... your voice is too deep to be &quot;cute.&quot; Though... it is nice... and to a degree, I was hoping for an actual date while we&#39;re here. Something sorta like what Nate Bowman had with Shuixing before he moved to Heiya Island and married her. But I didn&#39;t want to make it seem like... well... like I can&#39;t control myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;re in the same boat then,&quot; Ty gave a chuckle, &quot;wanting to control ourselves... me to be a gentleman and you to be an upstanding lady... while both having the desire to be with our respective potential bond mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe a bit of jealousy on my part,&quot; Kumiyo whispered to Ty, &quot;as Kumiko has her bond mate... and probably will take advantage of that with Ningen tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do better,&quot; Ty whispered back to her, seeing that they were still alone in the kitchen, and taking Kumiyo&#39;s hand in his.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Settling into things proved easy enough, Kumiko ultimately didn&#39;t give Kumiyo too much more than a smile, despite some of the earlier teasing. Which was ultimately something that confirmed to Ty that Kumiko wanted her cousin to be happy and had simply chosen a rather forward and teasing way of saying it. And the night with Kumiyo was wonderful for Ty, though as the next few days began, the focus came to more on showing his guests more around Dinotopia Aquatica and letting his guests meet his neighbors and friends. And the visitors from Heiya Island were more than happy to mix and mingle with the others at Dinotopia Aquatica. Largely set up by how Ty&#39;s shifts weren&#39;t always constant.<br />
<br />
The one that they had the most fun meeting with proved to be Danielle. The Dunkleosteus Animalian was friendly and was happy to converse while setting up one of the various parts of the small island&#39;s above ground businesses that covered Skull Island&#39;s history as a sort of pirate shelter until Spain lost control over Florida and a lot of their Caribbean trade shifted much further south. For the visitors it was following on how Danielle talked and how the various hinges in her armored skull seemed to be visible as she talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this is all interesting,&quot; Danielle commented, &quot;you all come to see the ancient swimmers and I get to meet two rare Killer Whales.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Orcas,&quot; Ningen corrected, &quot;Killer Whale... that just sounds mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not meant to be,&quot; Danielle assured him, &quot;I think the reference was based on the fact that the species is an active and successful hunter that generally has few real enemies in the modern ocean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Kumiko replied, &quot;my mate was born as a White Orca... though, I think Orca sounds cooler than Killer Whale. A more original name in my book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Danielle tilted her head, and noting the mixed scent between Ty and Kumiyo, she assumed what Kumiyo liked was Ty, but she was still curious about the two Orca Animalians, herself. &quot;So... what do you like about Dinotopia Aquatica, so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The interesting friends to be made,&quot; Kumiko said happily, &quot;seeing all the pirate stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing some of what Ty does for work and going swimming,&quot; Kumiyo added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully the water isn&#39;t too warm for you,&quot; Danielle answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too warm?&quot; Ningen wondered, his eyes focused more on the movement of how Danielle&#39;s jaws worked, as there were no fish in the sea that he&#39;d ever seen that were like Dunkleosteus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... too warm,&quot; Danielle nodded, &quot;our area hasn&#39;t been as bad, as we&#39;re actually closer to Jacksonville on Florida&#39;s northeast coast... but the waters around southern Florida... near Miami and the Keys... they&#39;ve had some days where the WATER temperature is over one hundred degrees, which gets rough when people normally go to the water to cool down... Only to find it hot and killing coral.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that can&#39;t be good,&quot; Ningen said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; Ty grumbled, &quot;and our &quot;loveable&quot; governor insists nothing be done about it. Like it&#39;ll magically go away...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The less that is said about politics, the better,&quot; Kumiyo urged, &quot;for the moment, we are on vacation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle nodded to that, &quot;and you&#39;ve all sought to make friends on this vacation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ningen nodded, &quot;all are interesting... and in ways I&#39;ve never seen before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Dunkleosteus did go extinct before even the Synapsids evolved, and has no modern descendants,&quot; Danielle gave a shrug, &quot;so... I suppose that isn&#39;t too much of a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those blades don&#39;t hurt, do they?&quot; Kumiko wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if a put a fin in and bite with full force,&quot; Danielle gave a wink and a laugh, &quot;otherwise, the blades are all part of the jaw and are designed to look the way they are. It gives me no problem other than slowing down how fast I can talk and things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may ask...&quot; Kumiyo began.<br />
<br />
&quot;How it works and how I can talk?&quot; Danielle replied, &quot;in a way, that&#39;s probably closer to how the Bird and Pterosaur Animalians can talk. I have to use my tongue more to enunciate words and that&#39;s a big part of why I&#39;d pronounce things slower than you, your mate, your cousin, or Ty. But it does work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you do for talk like a pirate day?&quot; Kumiko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Admission fees for the above ground facilities are half price,&quot; Danielle answered, &quot;yar.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned a few chuckled before they did make their way to observe Ty&#39;s work and enjoy some time swimming. The number of visitors on the beach were in lower numbers than expected, but Kumiko and Ningen did attract a fair number of people who noticed them from the IAC and some of the news reports that related to Ningen&#39;s beaching and then uplifting. Ty was even pleased to see some even ask them for autographs. It let him run his patrols and respond to the cases where someone might need help. Kumiyo swam, a little, and while the water was warm, it wasn&#39;t too warm... or at least she didn&#39;t feel like it was too warm for her. When she could, she talked with Ty and even the other lifeguards on duty, and thankfully they were fairly accepting and personally friendly. All of which made for a good visit.</p>
