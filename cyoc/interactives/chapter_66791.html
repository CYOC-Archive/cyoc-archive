<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look at yourself, in awe of how different you look. How weak and petite you seem. Your skin tone had <br />
become a bright tan, your wide hips and large ass, and skinny upper body. Your hands so delicate, and your <br />
tail a scarlet sort of color. You feel your feminine parts, your breasts so warm and so real, a D cup if you <br />
had to guess; and your vagina, as much as you couldn't believe you actually had one, was where your penis <br />
originally was, half of it being located in your human half, and the other half in the fish portion. You look <br />
at your hands once more and you see a shining golden ring, the only thing left of your humanity. A tear rolls <br />
down your eye as you realize how much of a terrible husband you've been, being seduced by the mermaids like <br />
the sailors of all those old stories. You felt weak, but as if you had no control over it. Your wife, left <br />
alone, to fend for herself, and then it hits your mind hard, pregnant. How could she give birth without you, <br />
her husband, the father; the terrible selfishness of your actions leaves you crying harder now, filled with so <br />
much emotion you never knew you could had, female emotions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, what's wrong, don't you like being our new sister?&quot; The redhead calls out, her skin was a silky white, <br />
her tail a sort of aquamarine color, and her breasts were a mere B cup, but her face was so innocent, and her <br />
voice, so inviting. You finally muster the strength to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I can't stay like this, I have a wife, she's waiting for me. If I don't go home soon, then...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what? She won't see you again? You're one of us, or is she more important than your sisters?&quot;<br />
You were interrupted by another mermaid. Her skin a sweet chocolate brown, golden yellow-orange tail with two <br />
black stripes on her back. Her breasts most certainly an E or F cup, wide hips and a much more powerful <br />
sounding voice than the redhead, and her face much more like that of a strong woman. Her authoritative figure <br />
intimidated your new weak body, and you were scared to say another word, but after a couple seconds of <br />
silence, minus the sound of the waves crashing into the sand and rocks, you finally manage to say something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, she's my wife, and I've known her for years now, I love her, and she loves me. She's even pregnant, we <br />
were going to have the most beautiful child and live the rest of our lives together. Now please, I am begging <br />
you, change me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, a pregnant wife eh, and you left her for us? How typical of men, but now you are one of us, so that won't <br />
happen anymore.&quot; The black one responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I couldn't help myself, it was impossible...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it was, we're irresistible creatures, so beautiful, and we live so long, you can't imagine how many <br />
sailors have gone crazy for us. It's so fun, you should be grateful we let you in on this.&quot; She responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's so fun! Trust me, it's an experience that never gets old! Oh, I have the best ideas for <br />
accessories I could make for you, if only I had your measurements and we could start right away!&quot; The blond <br />
one said, her skin as white as the red head, her face just as innocent, but her voice so eager, so exciting. <br />
Her tail was pink, with a sky blue tail fin, her breasts the same size as yours. She swam so elegantly to you, <br />
grabbed both your hands with her own soft, warm hands, pressed her breasts against yours, a feeling that sent <br />
shocks of pleasure through your body, you could feel both of your nipples becoming erect, and suddenly, out of <br />
nowhere, kisses you. Her tongue gracefully coming into contact with yours, and involuntarily, you couldn't <br />
help but keep on kissing her. Both your eyes close as this kiss lasts for about 30 seconds and finally she <br />
pulls back, leaving you in a daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't you stay with us sister? Please, we won't hurt you, or lie to you, ever?&quot; She looked at you with her <br />
innocent eyes, like a puppy begging for food. You feel so entranced, until finally, you snap out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I... I can't! My wife, our baby! I can't leave them alone! It's impossible, I'm not staying! No matter <br />
how hard you try, you won't convince me otherwise!&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond one swam next to you and hugged you, saying &quot;Please don't go, we were going to have so much fun!&quot; <br />
repeatedly. Her breasts felt so warm, but this method of letting you stay wasn't going to work on you. You <br />
finally demanded &quot;Change me back!&quot;.<br />
<br />
The fourth one out of the five of them finally decides it's her turn to say something. She was tan, a bit <br />
darker than your tan, but not too dark, her breasts an F cup, and her tail was orange, with a golden tail fin. <br />
Her build was similar to the black one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough girls, you're being too hurtful and inconsiderate to our new sister.&quot; she had a wonderful and <br />
entrancing voice, almost like she almost sang the words, and they gracefully entered your ears.<br />
<br />
And the last one spoke up, she had brown flowing hair, peach skin, not white, dark, but a peach sort of color, <br />
full of color and warmth. Her tail was a violet color, with red spots seemingly neatly arranged going down her  <br />
tail. Her breasts were a D cup, and she spoke with an intelligent, calming voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, we have brought her into the sisterhood, and once a sister, always a sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; you try to plead, but she interrupts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me finish, you will remain a sister for the rest of your life, however, certainly we can make a deal for <br />
you to not only remain a sister, but remain with your wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, anything, I'm begging you! I just want to be with my wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but first let me introduce you to the other sisters. The one with the red hair over there is Mary, <br />
the one with the dark skin is Abigail, the blond one is Elizabeth, the one with the orange tail is Veronica, <br />
and I am Florencia. These names were actually given to us by the first human who found us centuries ago, when <br />
we were what could be compared to teenagers in human years. The one who found us was a fairly nervous boy, <br />
about 15 at the time... Oh wait, I've gone off topic. What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael.&quot; You respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;From now on you shall be... what was the female equivalent of that name again... ah yes, Michelle. I hope you <br />
enjoy being part of the sisterhood, Michelle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The name Michelle pierced your ears, despite the wondrous tone it was said in. It only furthered the reality <br />
of what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, now, the deal, please, anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes, how could I forget, well... let me think... Ah yes I've got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heart began pounding as she opened her mouth to say the deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle...&quot;</p>
