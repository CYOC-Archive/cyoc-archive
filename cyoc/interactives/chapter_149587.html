<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Tara went about calling the station to inform Chief O&#39;Hara on the agreement that she&#39;d made with Moe, Moe was quick to head back into the cabin. He was more than happy to return to the home he&#39;d bought in Moon Lake to provide a safe place for his family, and now with the confidence that the Gambonis were no longer a threat to them. He wasn&#39;t completely sure on what this conference with the Chief of Police would be about, but figured that was probably some protocol that Moon Lake had, since it was a were sanctuary. At worst maybe some &quot;minor&quot; damage was done to the house, but that was the worst Moe could think of at the moment.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing was that Daniel Brooks&#39; promise to protect the Charlestons had come through. While they might need to be there for the trial of Marcus and or Vito with regard to the mobsters chasing them all over the country, that would be relatively minor things to deal with. They would go in, testify, and see the guilty verdict come down and put at least Marcus and Vito away for a good long while. In that time, Moe could look forward integrating his family more into Moon Lake. Karen had already done that in becoming a were, but that really wasn&#39;t the only thing on Moe&#39;s mind. Though a part of him was also privately intrigued with the idea now in some way, but being part of the town would be more than just joining were society. There was his business to get up and running again and there would be plenty of things in that regard still to do.<br />
<br />
Moe made his way up stairs to find that Nichole was slowly dressing herself, as the wake up had come early again and it made some sense to get up. As by now the sounds of the day starting would likely keep both of them up. Nichole looked to him as he came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did the check in go?&quot; Nichole asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We actually have good news,&quot; Moe commented, &quot;the two of them made their move sometime last night and Daniel and the others caught them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re caught?&quot; Nichole looked up with a smile forming on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Moe nodded back, letting a lot of the relief at the news that Officer Strange had relayed to him pouring out of him, &quot;Marcus and Vito are presently in jail and will likely be awaiting transfer to Seattle to await trail and will be held there. We may have to attend the trial as witnesses... but they will be taken down this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; Nichole gave a cheer with a small fist pump at the same time for added emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means Officer Strange is here to allow for the transport back into town to meet with the police chief and the FBI agent that had arranged all the planning for this,&quot; Moe explained, and barely hearing some steps out in the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would that mean?&quot; Nichole asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At best it might be some protocol for Moon Lake, I think,&quot; Moe answered, &quot;and at worst it&#39;d mean there might have been some small damage done... We won&#39;t know until we get there. But... before we can go... we have some sheets to wash. Both here from the master bedroom and the guest room Karen is in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right here,&quot; Karen said from behind them making Moe turn around to see his daughter standing there in the doorway. <br />
<br />
Karen had managed to squeeze herself into a pair of panties and pulled a shirt on but was otherwise undressed and her eyes were largely still shut. Moe could barely see Karen&#39;s eyes, though he guessed she was likely tired from the events that related to her first transformation and had wanted to sleep in. Regardless though, the news that the Gambonis were caught would be good, and Moe figured that would be worth the early morning wake up call.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Karen asked while stifling a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcus and Vito were caught last night,&quot; Moe told her, &quot;Daniel&#39;s plan worked and we can go home. There&#39;s likely some formality that will be needed to finish things out... but we can soon be on our way home. We just have to make sure the bed-linin is laundered before we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention packing things,&quot; Nichole added, &quot;In fact... Karen, you and I can get things packed. Moe, you can carry things down to the laundry room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re caught?&quot; Karen asked as Moe moved to begin stripping the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Moe nodded, &quot;we won&#39;t have to run anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen did a bit of a fist pump as well before turning to head out and finish dressing herself. Moe, meanwhile, quickly went about collecting up the sheets and other bed linin. The pillow covers were the hardest to remove, but Moe was able to get them. Karen even helped out as he got to the guest room. He thanked her and then slowly made his way back down toward the ground floor. The stairs were a bit difficult to handle going down as both his arms were full and at the time. He was ultimately met by Officer Strange as he reached the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy...&quot; Tara said slowly and came forward to steady Moe as he came down the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Moe managed as he got down onto solid ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it wouldn&#39;t be a good day if you fall down the stairs after getting good news,&quot; Tara answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for the time to handle all this...&quot; Moe replied, &quot;it&#39;s the least we can do after you offered your home for us to stay in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no big problem... and I&#39;d probably have to do some cleaning anyway... so... you wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to do this,&quot; Tara told him, though a part of her thought back on some of the things her father had said to her before she left his cabin further up the mountain. On some level, she might suspect that being possible with Karen, given what she knew on how Karen became a weretiger, but with Moe and Nichole, that would be a different issue. Though with the way Moe had seemed to push getting at least the bed linin washed made her wonder if Moe and Nichole were falling under the sort of magic that Moon Lake just seemed to have over  some people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but it is your home, not a hotel,&quot; Moe answered as Tara lead him back to where.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps...&quot; Tara admitted, &quot;we&#39;ll get this in a load and then head out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t they have different washing instructions?&quot; Moe asked as they reached the washing machine and he watched Tara lift the lid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Tara answered, &quot;everything&#39;s pretty standard and washes the same way. And the detergent I use doesn&#39;t bleed colors that much... if at all. So... there isn&#39;t that much to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Moe said slowly and proceeded to push the sheets into the open space. They fit in, alright, though with just enough size that it too a little bit of effort to get them all in. As he finished with that, Tara presented him with the detergent bottle cap presently filled with the cleaner, and Moe could smell the detergent&#39;s scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just spread that over the top and then press the start button,&quot; Tara instructed.<br />
<br />
Moe followed the instructions, handed the cap back to Tara and shut the lid to the washing machine. It was soon humming after pressing the start button. With that, he turned back to Tara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Tara spoke, &quot;I can handle the drying cycle come lunch time... if need be. Thank you for being willing to help with all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the least I could do,&quot; Moe said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now with that done... we can get going,&quot; Tara spoke, &quot;as the Chief is allowing for some time for this... but it can&#39;t be super late. Agent Baoman has his own schedule to keep as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just have to check to make sure everyone is finished packing,&quot; Moe answered with a nervous smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Tara nodded.</p>
