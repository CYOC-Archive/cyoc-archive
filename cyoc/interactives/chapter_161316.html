<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gingerly, you grab the sprinkle covered cookie. It was the only one decorated like that, all the others being simply different colors, so if all of but one of them changed you into something else, the odd one out should change you back... or there was no rhyme or reason to them and it was Russian roulette. You glance over at the woman to see if she would react to your selection, but she continued to smile at you expectantly.<br />
<br />
Nervously you glance at the cookie. It looked like a sugar cookie with multi-color sprinkles, nothing seemed to indicate what it would do. Finally, you take a deep breath and take a bite. Just like the previous one it tasted amazing, but you refrained from eating more, hoping if you&#39;d chosen wrong you&#39;d only partially transform and if you chose right, you could just finish the cookie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to finish it for it take affect.&quot; the woman grinned, almost smugly.<br />
<br />
You look back at the cookie and grimace as you finish it, hoping that this was all just a joke on her part and you&#39;ll be out of this mansion with a much greater respect for mysterious buildings in just a little bit. A stand there nervously glancing at yourself and the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;A good choice,&quot; your heart leaps as you almost fall over as the tension leaves your body, &quot;but not the correct choice.&quot; only for it plummet into your feet as you sag with a sense of despair. You catch yourself and look down at your body, desperately trying to figure out what was changing. <br />
<br />
You quickly notice something, your shirt, which had been pulled tight by your new chest, was loosening. As were your pants around your hips. Any hope that the woman was wrong and you were changing back quickly vanished as your hair started growing again. Soon you find everything getting looser, too loose. Desperately you grab your sagging pants trying to keep them up, while they quickly started pooling around your ankles. You look up briefly at the woman, her smile having grown into a self satisfied smirk, to find her taller then you and difference continued to grow.<br />
<br />
Your clothes were getting ridiculous. There was a feeling of your shirt slipping off your shoulder, giving a peak of your new breasts, and of  your sleeves bunching up around your tiny hands holding up your increasingly heavy pants. You could feel your shoes growing as your socks loosened and awkwardly sagged on your petite legs. Suddenly it stopped. You weren&#39;t getting any smaller, but a tingly sensation told you that you were still changing.<br />
<br />
Looking back up, your attention is full on your hair again. It was changing color and still growing. It was already to your was and was shifting to an impossible hue, a dark deep green. You stared at it in fascinated horror as the color spread through your locks even as they continued to spill out of your head. A twinge shifted your attention again, back to your chest. Your considerable bosom was diminishing. Deflating before your eyes. Maybe you&#39;d be a guy at least? But once again your faint flicker of hope was snuffed out again as they stopped getting smaller. Not only were your tiny but your chest was as well, seeming just enough to be noticeable but that was it, causing an unexpected sense of frustration.<br />
<br />
The tingling was all over your body still, confusing you. You weren&#39;t getting any shorter, so what was changing? You let go of your pants with your right hand, refusing to let them fall despite everything, and pushed up your sleeve on your left hand. Your arms were thinning even more and you quickly found holding up your bulky jeans to be quite the struggle. Your skin was changing as well, turning green like your hair but much brighter. Soon though the tingle faded until it was just at your ears and then that too faded.<br />
<br />
When it was all said and done, you shrunk to the point of the woman&#39;s belly, and your leaf green hair was pooled on the ground. You felt tiny and weak. You trembled as you looked up at your tormentor, desperately shifting your ill fitting clothes to cover yourself again, your tiny hand cramping as it held up your last attempt at dignity.<br />
<br />
She smirked down at you, &quot;My my my, what an adorable little forest spirit you&#39;ve become.&quot; her hand came down onto your small head and rubbed it roughly, nearly knocking you over. She laughed as you struggled with your clothes and gave you a small push, sending you into a heap on the ground. &quot;Why don&#39;t we have a good look at you, my pretty?&quot; before you could get yourself back together she was pulling your clothes off and away from you, starting with your pants, which took you shoes with them. In vain, you try to fight her off but she overpowers you condescending ease. As she pulls your shirt off, you tumble to the ground, naked and terrified.<br />
<br />
Slowly, she pulls out a hand mirror, obviously savoring the moment, and handed it to you. &quot;Go ahead and give yourself a look.&quot; <br />
<br />
You take it, awkwardly handling the seemingly too large hand mirror, and look into it. Despite, how much you&#39;ve shrunk and how your figure largely evaporated, your face still shows you as a mature, gorgeous (if green) woman with large pointed elf ears. You can&#39;t help but stare at yourself in gaping fascination. <br />
<br />
A chuckle brakes you our of your daze, &quot;Happy with the results?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no!&quot; you gasp at the sound of your voice, tiny and high, exactly like someone would expect you to sound. &quot;Please change me back! I&#39;m sorry I broke into your house, I&#39;ll never do it again!&quot; you beg.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already gave you a chance to turn back.&quot; her smile fading as she grabbed one of the cookies, the blue one and looked at it.<br />
<br />
You were about to try and jump for it, as she wasn&#39;t holding it very high so you may be able to reach it, but suddenly it crumbled to dust. You stare at the grey pile on the floor in complete despair. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a fun little distraction you were,&quot; the woman was smiling again, &quot;But now I will have to ask you to leave the premises. Off you go!&quot; she makes a shooing motion at you and you find yourself sliding towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, no!&quot; you scream in panic as you find yourself hurtling out of the kitchen and then outside, despite trying to run towards her. The moment you can start moving on your own again, the door slammed shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what am I supposed to do like this?!&quot; you look down at your small green body and awkwardly long hair.</p>
