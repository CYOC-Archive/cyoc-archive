<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oops, they gave me the wrong suit,&quot; you said to yourself.  Opening the stall, you head back to find the woman who handed it to you.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say as you approach.  She turns to face you.  &quot;It looks like you gave me a women&#39;s swimsuit by mistake.  Do you have any for men?&quot;<br />
She raises an eyebrow.  &quot;Oh, I did, didn&#39;t I?&quot;  She takes the opened package back and puts it on a table and then opens the cabinet and looks through it for a moment.  &quot;Sorry, it looks like that&#39;s all we have.  There&#39;s a few smaller sizes if you need it.&quot;<br />
You motion to the swimsuit on the table.  &quot;Well, I can&#39;t really wear that, can I?&quot;<br />
&quot;You could just pull it up to your waist and tuck in the top.&quot;  She paused for a moment and saw the unconvinced look on your face.  &quot;If you wear a T-shirt over it, people will think you&#39;re wearing a Speedo.&quot;<br />
You shrug and take the swimsuit back.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll try that and see how it looks.&quot;<br />
You wander back to the bathroom, enter a stall, and remove your clothing and hang it on a hook on the back of the door.  You take your shoes off and stand on top of them rather than placing your feet on the potentially disgusting bathroom floor.  Standing naked in the stall, you hold the swimsuit and let out a sigh.  &quot;Oh well, here goes,&quot; you think to yourself.<br />
You place your left foot into the swimsuit followed by your right and pull it up to your crotch.  It&#39;s a snug fit.  You adjust your junk and run your thumb through the leg elastic to adjust the fit.  After putting your feet back into your shoes, you pull up the top and put your arms through the holes and adjust the straps on your shoulders.  Without delay, you take your shirt off the hook and put it over the swimsuit.<br />
You grab your clothes and exit the bathroom stall.  As you walk out, you see yourself in the mirror.  The lifeguard was right, it does look like you&#39;re wearing a Speedo even though you can feel the tight spandex of the swimsuit under your dark blue T-shirt.<br />
You exit the bathroom and find the lifeguard waiting in the main office of the station.  She spots you as you enter the room.  &quot;See? That&#39;s not so bad,&quot; she says.<br />
&quot;I guess not, but I can&#39;t really swim on rescues wearing this &#39;California&#39; T-shirt,&quot; you complain.<br />
&quot;Not idea, no,&quot; she agrees, &quot;but it&#39;s only for today.  I&#39;d like to see what you&#39;ve got before we make it permanent.  Give me your clothes and I&#39;ll store them here. Then let&#39;s head down to the water for some training.&quot;<br />
You hand her your clothes and she puts them in the cabinet.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take your sneakers too. You don&#39;t want to get them full of sand.&quot;  You slip your feet out of the shoes and hand them over and she places them in the cabinet and closes it.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go.&quot;  She walks out the door.  As you follow her out of the lifeguard station, she starts jogging toward the water.  You jog to catch up.<br />
As you reach the water, you both stop and face the ocean.  &quot;Okay,&quot; she says as she looks over at you.  &quot;Let&#39;s start simple.  We&#39;ll wade out until just past where we can touch the ground and I&#39;ll show you some tricks of the trade.&quot;<br />
You look back at her and nod.  &quot;Sounds good.&quot;  You both start to wade into the water.  It&#39;s colder than you expected and you can feel goosebumps on your skin, but it&#39;s not slowing her down so you keep pace.  As the water reaches your crotch, you can feel your scrotum react and retreat a bit.  &quot;Ooh, that&#39;s cold,&quot; you mutter.<br />
&quot;You get used to it,&quot; she replies.<br />
As you get up to your waist, the T-shirt starts to float.  You try pushing it down, but it resists.<br />
She notices your trouble.  &quot;Maybe you should take that off now?  Your chest will be under water soon and nobody&#39;s going to see what you&#39;re wearing.&quot;<br />
You continue trying to keep the shirt under control.  &quot;Where can I put it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Give it to me.  I&#39;ll just tie it to my float.&quot;  She holds up her red buoyant float.<br />
You decide to give in.  &quot;Okay.&quot;  You pull the half-soaked shirt over your head and lower your body into the water so that nobody on shore can see what you&#39;re wearing.  You reach toward her and hand her the shirt.  She twists it into a rope-like shape and then loosely ties it to her float.<br />
You look down at yourself.  The cold water seems to be making your skin have a tingling feeling.  You&#39;re surprised the goosebumps haven&#39;t died down yet.<br />
A moment later, the lifeguard turns to you.  &quot;Okay, I think this is a good spot.  Let me see how long you can hold your breath.&quot;  She raises her left arm which has a waterproof sport watch.  &quot;Okay, and...go!&quot;<br />
You take a deep breath and submerge your head under water.  The cold water hurts your skin for a moment and you feel the same tingling feeling on your face.  You also feel your hair floating above you.  You continue to keep yourself underwater and start to release bubbles slowly.<br />
About 60 seconds later, you push your head above the surface of the water and take a deep breath.  You wipe your eyes and pull your hair back out of your face, but there seems to be a lot of hair...a lot more than usual.  You open your eyes and see your brown hair extending down past your shoulders.  &quot;What the hell?&quot; you think to yourself.  &quot;Did I get some weird seaweed in my hair or something?&quot;  You reach up to the top of your head and feel your regular hair.  You continue to follow it down and run your fingers through your hair looking for something that might be stuck in it, but you keep running your fingers through it...and you keep going...and going...  You pull your hair out in front of you so you can look at it.  It looks like your hair, but it&#39;s so much longer than it was a moment ago.<br />
You look up at the lifeguard and hold your hair up to show her.  &quot;What the fuck?&quot; you ask, but the voice surprises you.  It&#39;s not your voice.  It sounds like a woman.  You grab your throat with your right hand and cough to clear your throat.  &quot;Erm hrm...&quot;  You hum a little and it sounds different.  &quot;What the hell?&quot;  You again hear the woman&#39;s voice.  &quot;What happened to my voice?&quot;<br />
The lifeguard smiled.  &quot;I think our lifeguard training is complete.&quot;<br />
You look at her confused.  &quot;Huh?  What the hell does that mean?  What happened to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;You see, you&#39;ve worn a sort of enchanted swimsuit.  It has given you special skills necessary to be one of the best lifeguards on the planet.  You&#39;ll find that you not only have excellent swimming skills, but you now have the knowledge necessary to be a lifeguard.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; you ask, doubting her claim.  &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous.  A swimsuit did that?&quot;<br />
&quot;You can see yourself and hear yourself, but still don&#39;t believe me?&quot;  She chuckled.  &quot;Okay, fine.  I&#39;ll prove it.  What are the five steps of CPR?&quot;<br />
&quot;One, ensure that you are in a safe environment. Two, check if the victim is responsive.  Three, open the airway.  Four, check for breathing.  Five, give rescue breaths.  Holy shit, how I know that?&quot;  Your eyes opened in amazement.<br />
She grinned.  &quot;See?  You&#39;re a lifeguard.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just by wearing this swimsuit?&quot;  You looked down at the swimsuit.  It looked different.  &quot;Wait a second...&quot;  You felt your chest and found two soft breasts.  &quot;What the fuck?  I have breasts?!&quot;<br />
The lifeguard smirked.  &quot;That&#39;s not all...&quot;<br />
You felt down to where your penis would be, but felt nothing.  Where moments ago there was a small bulge that was made smaller by the cold water, there was now nothing.  You frantically started feeling around your body and quickly discovered that the hair on your legs had disappeared as well as most of your arm hair and the hair in your armpits.  You felt your chin and no longer felt any trace of stubble.  In a panic, you looked up at the lifeguard.  &quot;What have you done to me?!&quot;<br />
&quot;You wanted to be a lifeguard...&quot;  She shrugged.  &quot;...so I made you one.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do I get rid of this curse?  If I take the swimsuit off will I change back?&quot;  You started to pull it off your shoulder.<br />
&quot;No, stop.  Taking it off won&#39;t change you back,&quot; she said as she swam closer.  &quot;Leave it on.  Nobody needs to see a naked woman coming out of the water.  There&#39;s kids on this beach!&quot;<br />
You tried to calm down.  &quot;Look, I wanted to be a lifeguard, but I didn&#39;t want to permanently become a woman.  I have a life!  ...had a life?  Can I change back if I swim in warm water?  Is this some kind of Ranma 1/2 thing?&quot;<br />
She looked confused.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what that is.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an anime series from a long time ago.  Guy falls into a cursed pond and becomes female if he gets splashed with cold water and male if he&#39;s splashed with warm water...or maybe the other way around.  That&#39;s not important.  Can this be reversed?&quot;<br />
She put her hands on your shoulders.  &quot;There may be ways, but promise me that you&#39;ll at least try this out first, okay?&quot;<br />
You took a deep breath.  &quot;Okay, fine.  When in Rome, I guess...&quot;<br />
She pointed to the lifeguard station.  &quot;Let&#39;s go back.  We can talk.&quot;<br />
You nodded.  &quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
