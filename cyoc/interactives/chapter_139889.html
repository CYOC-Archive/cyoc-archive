<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">not wanting to just stand around here and do nothing till someone finds you in fear that You decided to get out of the house as soon as possible. slowly creeping your way out of your room and down the stairs, after You grabbed most of your things you&#39;ll need as you check to see if anyone was around that you were soon on your way to the front door, but then you hear a knock on door when the thought of who could it be while you head to the door as see who it was. you soon reached to the front door and opened it, but what greeted you when you open the door supersized you even more as you realized it was surprisingly Your neighbor, Leo.<br />
<br />
Leo was a nice looking young man who comes over to say &#39;hi&#39; and catch up on everything every couple of days as he also comes over to help you with your homework your bad at. Leo blinks for a moment as he then jerks back with widen eyes that you knew you had to eventually tell someone as they&#39;ll also have to see you like this, but maybe you should of think about it more for did you really want him to see you looking like this? But then, this seems to be the new you now that if a friend can&#39;t deal with you being an anthro pony girl, then what will the rest of the world think of you?<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi, shit man! excuse the french. man, That&#39;s some awesome freakin&#39; costume you got there! Where did you get it?&quot; he said as Leo&#39;s eyes then stares at you in wonder who you are and where you actually went to with a strange look in his eyes.<br />
<br />
not thinking about it now that You decided to step back as you then walk back into the living room, knowing very well he&#39;ll follow you in. sure enough, he dose as you hear him shutting the door. it wasn&#39;t long till you then hear him gasp again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! excuse the french again. is just that, Your tail! it moves, like it was real!&quot; you hear him say.<br />
<br />
your Tail?! You reach back to discover what he was talking about as it was your pony tail that now flicks over your rear. Sighing as you turned around to face him that His eyes were wide, realizing on how much taller you are now while taking in the blue eyes, the equine muzzle, the brown fur, and the massive hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, MY GOSH! That&#39;s not even a costume you&#39;re wearing, is it?&quot; he said shocked for he wasn&#39;t seeing just a hot girl, but some anthro pony girl in his Neighbor&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Leo? Try not to freak out about this, but I&#39;m sorta looking a bit strange right now as i&#39;m kind of different today.&quot; you say to him, but he couldn&#39;t stop staring at such a pretty looking girl till he snapped out of it and heard what she said earlier.<br />
<br />
Any minute now that Leo&#39;s going to start running, screaming back to the door outside and tell a crazy story of his findings. however, he wasn&#39;t like that for instead is where he still sat on the couch stun as he was struck by amazement. realizing that he was starting to get feeling for you now, you slowly began to explain on how this has happened to you while crouching down to his eye level.<br />
<br />
&quot;lesson, Leo. we need to talk. you&#39;re not going to believe this, but i&#39;m actually your neighbor as i was once a human man. I know this may seem strange to you as it&#39;s coming from someone you may don&#39;t even know that you think I somehow broken in this house, but I know you for we have been neighbors for awhile now while I lived here my whole life.&quot; you begin to say while sighing in hopes of have him to believe you, but as you talked that he reaches up to touch your face for he was a kid with a big puppy dog.<br />
<br />
You liked the attention he was giving you as you could sensed it, even smell it that you realized he was being turn on by this. feeling your jaw, your nostrils, your mane, even your pointed pony ears that this was somehow calming you down while turning you on for him, when he made contact. You had to force yourself and not to react by this for You didn&#39;t want to scare him that it seemed not to be an issue at first, but when his hands began to reached and explore your furry C cups size chest breasts is when it became an issue of him touching a woman&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
he Then slides his hands over to the beautiful brown fur you now had that showed no fear as things were getting out of hand. you had to think of something and fast as A strange and strong musk you smell starts to fill the air. wait a minute, it was coming from you that with In less than a minute is when he undoes the catch of your pants.<br />
<br />
the pony in you was becoming aroused, which was casing you to feel swollen while feeling the lips of your groin to expand as they were wet. whatever changed you is still active as you felt a powerful surge of desire that It was more than emotional for you then felt a stronger sense of connection to your neighbor, it was like some sort of magic which was at least partly under your control while Leo hands slide down to caress your swollen lips. A low neigh rumbles from your throat as it triggers a sudden, intense need that you gently start sliding your hooves down his back.<br />
<br />
not holding these feeling back anymore that Leo soon gasps as you embrace him hard against you. when you did this that you nearly forgot to tell him about something as it soon came to you for it was about, the masks in the box. you wanted to keep going with him, but maybe if you tell him about the mask that maybe you&#39;ll get some answers here as to what was happening to you.</p>
