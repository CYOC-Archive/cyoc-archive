<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mika!!!”<br />
<br />
A blast of fire now exploded through Mika’s apartment causing Mika to dive for cover as Kari shrieked in terror. Gathering her bearings Mika looked to see her fiancé Claudia. The petite blonde sorceress stoos, surrounded in magical flames, her eyes glowing with power as she gazed around the room. As her eyes fell upon the frightened Kitsune she roared with anger. “Kitsune,” she howled. “Where’s Mika?”<br />
<br />
Kari threw herself to the floor, covering her head with her arms and tail. “Please don’t hurt me,” she whimpered. Claudia wasn’t a patient woman though as she now prepared to set the young Kitsune on fire. Mika, seeing this now lept to her feet. “Whoa what fuck Claud!”<br />
<br />
Claudia paused as she now stared at a bewildered Mika. “Mika What the hell is going on,” she exclaimed. “I heard you call out. I thought you were in trouble or something.”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine just shocked,” Mika breathed. “Now can you tone it down a bit your going to set my damn place on fire.”<br />
<br />
Claudia’s spell dissipated she angrily gazed at her fiancé. “Seriously your pissed at me,” so he grumbled, “I come flying to your rescue, which is something you didn’t do for me when I got turned to stone and your pissed!”<br />
<br />
“Oh you are NOT starting that arguement again,” Mika bellowed. “How many freaking times do I have to apologize. I mean seriously you were in another freaking timeline for Christ sakes.”<br />
<br />
As the couple now began to argue, Kari opened her eyes, curiously gazing at the couple. It bewildered her that these two would behave like this. The young teen had never seen anyone act quite like this before. While the two were obviously passionate, they had a certain amount of quirks. “What odd wizards,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Okay Fine,” Claudia huffed. “I’m sorry I almost blew up your house. Now can you please tell me what the hell a Kitsune is doing in the house?”<br />
<br />
“I was trying to figure that out before you busted in,” Mika groaned. “I just found her wandering around on the street. I couldn’t just leave her there.” Claudia nodded as she now approached the dumbfounded teen, gazing at her with a critical eye. “Well she looks like the ones we fought.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah except for the fact she’s a bit young,” Mika stated. “I mean she looks barely old enough to be in high school.”<br />
<br />
“I am quite mature for my age,” Kari frowned. “My parents often say I am more mature than most girls my age.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah she’s a kid,” Claudia sighed, “No one says something like that unless they want to see older than they are. So how old are you kid? 13? 14?”<br />
<br />
“15,” Kari huffed. “I turn 16 next winter.”<br />
<br />
“So you just turned 15,” Claudia said flatly. Kari frowned as she glared at the two women. “You seem awfully rude,” Kari huffed. “Mika was a great deal more pleasant to deal with.” Mika now grabbed her fiancé, who looked close to punching the young teen before sighing. “Claud will you relax,” she groaned. “She’s a decent kid okay and super polite. You chewing her head off isn’t helping anyone.”<br />
<br />
Claudia looked at her fiancé, taking a deep breath before turning towards Kari. “Okay sorry,” she sighed. “I have a bit of a short fuse, especially when it comes to Mika.”<br />
<br />
“It is Understandable I suppose,” Kari said, still giving Claudia a critical look. “My father acts quite similarly whenever my mother is distressed, I usually find it quite humorous when he bellows at those that would disrespect my mother.”<br />
<br />
Claudia grinned turning from Kari to Mika with a smug look. “And you say I’m too overprotective,” she smirked. Mika tried to stifle a laugh as she playfully shoved Claudia. “We’ll talk later about that,” she grinned. “Now Kari, what can you tell us about yourself. Tell us everything.”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Kari said quietly. “But first, I wish to return to my human form. Most people are usually taken aback by this form.” Claudia and Mika nodded as the young teen now began to focus her magic. The two college women watched as the Kitsunes ears slowly shrank back to human proportions, while her black fur began to recede. Kari’s muzzle began to return to a more human shape as it slowly withdrew back into place, her whiskers disappearing one by one while her nose went from black to flesh tone once more. As the girl now went from anthro fox to human teen she smiled, looking down at her fox tail as it tucked itself away inside the girls kimono. As the young Japanese teen finished her transformation she gave the two wome a shy smile. “Is this better?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Mika said kindly. “Your a very pretty girl Kari.”<br />
<br />
Kari thanked the two, sighing as she brushed her long dark hair behind her ear. “Okay Kari tell us what you remember,” Claudia said. Kari now rubbed her temples as she tried to piece together what had happened. The teens eyes were fuzzy but she remembered walking through the woods after meeting someon. The girls memories were fuzzy but she recalled that the meeting was important, it had to do with a mutual enemy as well as other Kitsune. What the meeting entailed though was a complete blank. As she was heading for home though she remembered a witch. The witch tried to attack the young teen who fled quickly useing her magic. She arrived here somehow and then ran into Mika.<br />
<br />
“So you really don’t have any memory of anything,” Mika asked. A sad look spread across the young teens face as she shook her head no. Claudia now gazed at the girl, rubbing her chin thoughtfully. “Mika can I talk to you in private real quick?” Mika nodded as the two excused themselves. Stepping away from the young teen Claudia now looked at her fiancé.<br />
<br />
“You can sense it too huh,” she whispered. “Someone aged her down into a teen.”<br />
<br />
Mika nodded, giving the young girl a passing glance. “Yeah I can sense it,” she said softly. “Omeone used some pretty powerful transformation magic on her and wiped out a big portion of her memory too.”<br />
<br />
“Think it was Lilith,” Claudia asked. Mika nodded, sighing before turning towards her fiancé. “Claud,” she said. “You do know what this means?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Claudia sighed. “We’re going to have to take care of her until this is over.”<br />
<br />
The two college girls now looked back at the young teen who was happily eating her dinner once more. “Well,” Claudia smirked. “If the others are starting families, don’t see why we can’t either.”<br />
<br />
Claudia and Mika sighed before looking once more at the young girl. Despite their differences, their explosive personalities, and the fact they weren’t even married yet, the two now looked forward to adding an addition to their very odd family.</p>
