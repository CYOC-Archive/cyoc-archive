<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twisting about on the floor, wanting to call out to whoever was calling my name, I felt the cramping sensation grow, dissipate some, flare up and then leave completely. Blinking unsure if my transformation was complete, I listened as a door nearby closed and the male voice called my name again, growing fainter as it moved away. Attempting to stand, I instead flopped back down onto the floor and weakly called out, &quot;I'm here,&quot; knowing as the last word left my lips, whoever had been calling my name would not have even heard it.<br />
<br />
Again, I tried to call out to them, the name Bucky flashing in my mind as I do so, and failing to get any louder than a whisper, I wonder if maybe why I cannot talk loudly was an after effect of the change. Shifting tactics, I try to stand again, fail, and hissing in frustration, I try again, this time succeeding. Somewhere, far off, I hear the male voice calling for me and deciding I can wait to see what I changed into, I rush across the room and wrenching the door open, I slip on something, slide out the door and for a moment, I pinwheel my arms as I attempt to regain my balance. But than I am falling forward, my arms shooting out before me as instant reflex, wanting only to cushion my fall and not hurt myself to much.<br />
<br />
In front of me, I see blackness and for a moment I cannot comprehend what I am seeing. And as it dawns on me that the floor for some reason has disappeared, I have a brief flashing thought as I think, &quot;Strange. It was there when I went into the room,&quot; before I tumble into the blackness, the last thing I hear was the male voice, calling my name, drawing closer.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
With a start, I sit up, looking about, blinking. Around me everything has a foggy look and for some reason I cannot get my eyes to focus. Sliding out of the bed, unsure how I had got into the bed, I look around the room and than back at the bed. With a gasp, I see...<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Again I awake, the thought of having just awoken leaving me confused as I thought I had been looking at myself lying in a bed. Around me, everything has a slightly out of focused look and for a moment, I blink, trying to bring everything into focus. When that doesn't work, I figure my eyesight will clear more when I get up and start to actually move about. Sliding out of the bed, I stand for a moment next to it, blinking, trying to sort out my thoughts. After a moment, I decide that what I really need to do was pee and turning, I start to walk across the room, but stop when something catches my eye.<br />
<br />
Turning back toward the bed, I see...<br />
-----<br />
<br />
With a gasp, I begin to thrash about, unsure of where I am, the sheet that had been covering me getting tangled around me as I do so. When I am finally able to calm myself, I remain lying on the bed, scared to get up, unsure if I am really awake this time or merely still dreaming. After some time, still unable to get my thoughts straight I...<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Sitting up with a start, the pillow falling of the bed as I did so, breathing in the air that smelled faintly of my long dead mother, I began looking wildly about the room, sure that this time I was really awake. A feeling like I had been swimming under water and than struggling to surface coming over me, I shifted in the bed and letting my feet drape over the side, I peered around the room, reaching down the grab the pillow that had fallen from the bed as I did so. Seeing the layer of dust covering everything, I concluded that nobody had lived here in years and breathing deeply, no longer smelling the familiar scent of my mother, I slid out of the bed, suddenly wanting to exit the house.<br />
<br />
As I stretched, I glanced toward the window and barely any sunlight, I wondered how long I had been sleeping. Moving across the room, I paused in front of a very dirty mirror and for a moment, peered at the girl in the bucket had reflected back.<br />
<br />
When it started to come back to me all that had had taken place, the weird dream of my sister, her friend and Bucky flashing briefly through my mind, I slowly reaching down and touched the front of my pants and feeling only flatness, I began to panic. Slipping my inside my pants, past my underwear and finally touching my male genitalia, I breathed a sigh of relief and wanting to actually see them, I pulled my hand out of my underwear and pants and than pushed both garments down, adjusted myself and for a moment, just stood in front of the mirror, staring at my penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
After a bit it dawned on me that something was off and for some time I could figure out what. Peering into the mirror, I pushed my pants down around my ankles, took off the bucket hat and pulled off my shirt and tried to figure out what was off. After some time of staring, it came to me that what was off was that I looked like a girl with male genitalia and that my penis and testicles where smaller and had started taking on a more pinkish-white tinge.<br />
<br />
Alarmed, I ran a hand across my body, which looked like it still had a few traces of baby fat left but was losing them slowly, noted that I still had breast buds and that my nipples and the surrounding area was uncomfortable to touch, and thinking that my skin felt smooth, I tucked my penis and testicles back, noting as I did that when I did, the illusion that I was looking at a little girl was complete. Frustrated, I hiked my underwear and pants back, pulled back on my shirt and hat and exited the room, no longer wanting to be in the house and not really wanting to search for people, knowing that I wouldn't find any body.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
After leaving the house, I didn't even bother checking the rest of the room, knowing that they would be empty anyway, I paused and wondered where Rei was and whether I should go and find the other girl. Stopping my train of thought, realising that I had just thought of myself as a girl, I shook my head and decided that what I really need was some alone time to clear my head.<br />
<br />
Wandering away from the houses, I started walking one way, abruptly changed direction, began walking a different direction and instead stopped, looked about and started walking toward the beach. Instead of finding my way back to the beach, I instead found myself outside a park and peering in, I wondered if maybe I should enter or continue trying to find my way back to the beach. After some deliberation, I decided that maybe walking in the park would be just as relaxing as walking on the beach and entering, I briefly noted the large stone pillars on either side of the entrance-way, the wrought iron archway about and the wrought iron fence that ran along the edge.<br />
<br />
As I walked and tried to clear my head, I thought briefly of my dream, almost positive that it was a dream but figuring that, seeing as I was sucked into my computer and into the choose your own change website, it might be something else, before shifting my attention and trying to determine how it was I was to get out of the computer.<br />
<br />
After some time of wandering, and getting really nowhere in figuring out how to leave the choose your own change website it came to me that in all my time wandering, the sun had never moved. Stopping and peering upward, I placed a hand over my brow and tried to see through the canopy, past the bright rays that where shining down. When that failed, I dropped my hand and began looking about for a suitable tree to climb and finally spotting one, I headed for it and leaping up to grasp the lowest branch, I began to climb.<br />
<br />
When I had finally gone as high as I figured I was going to get, I stopped and peered out, taking note that the park appeared to stretch off for miles in all directions. Glancing back the way I came, mentally noting the direction, I peered at the town, which looked really small from the height and distance I was at. Remembering why it was that I climbed up, I peered up into the sky and for a moment, I found myself confused. Mentally going over the position of the sun when I had left the house, which looked about near sun down, I figured that, if anything else, the sun now appeared to be about just past the noon hour. Unsure how this could be, I remained where I was for a bit longer before mentally shrugging and climbing back down, being careful to always note the direction of the beach resort as I did.<br />
<br />
Back on the ground, I located the path I had been following and deciding I no longer really wanted to be in this park, I started back toward the town. As I did, I tried to figure out how it was that the sun could move back, but unable to come up with a logical solution, I decided in the end it had something to do with the magick of the website.<br />
<br />
&quot;After all,&quot; I concluded as I drew near a building that I figured must be a public restroom. &quot;How else it possible for a boy to suddenly develop breast buds, long flowing hair and a an all too feminine body?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stopping, I suddenly realised that to that question I had no answer, except that it must be the same magicks of the choose your own change website that allowed for the sun to move in the opposite direction and for another girl to see me as a girl entering the first changes of puberty. Glancing at the public restroom, realising I had to pee really badly, I pushed all of it from my mind, figuring I'd sort of that conundrum later as I walked towards the building.<br />
<br />
When I reached the public restroom, I once again stopped and gazed at the door to my right, for women, and the door to my left, for men. My mind was telling to take the right one, that it was appropriate, but wanting to fight this, I whispered to myself, &quot;I am not a girl. I only like to dress like one. That doesn't mean I want to be one. Just that I like to dress in girl's clothes,&quot; I reached for the handle on the men's room door and pulling on it, I paused for a moment, cringing away when the stench of I don't know how many past men using the room wafted out in a sour, piss and cigarette smell.<br />
<br />
Twisting about on the floor, wanting to call out to whoever was calling my name, I felt the cramping sensation grow, dissipate some, flare up and then leave completely. Blinking unsure if my transformation was complete, I listened as a door nearby closed and the male voice called my name again, growing fainter as it moved away. Attempting to stand, I instead flopped back down onto the floor and weakly called out, &quot;I'm here,&quot; knowing as the last word left my lips whoever had been calling my name would not have even heard it.<br />

<br />
When I reached the public restroom, I once again stopped and gazed at the door to my right, for women, and the door to my left, for men. My mind was telling to take the right one, that it was appropriate, but wanting to fight this, I whispered to myself, &quot;I am not a girl. I only like to dress like one. That doesn't mean I want to be one. Just that I like to dress in girl's clothes,&quot; I reached for the handle on the men's room door and pulling on it, I paused for a moment, cringing away when the stench of I don't know how many past men using the room wafted out in a sour, piss and cigarette smell.<br />
<br />
Letting go of the handle, I almost turned away and headed for the woman's toilet, but than told myself that it was a public toilet and that the woman's loo wouldn't probably smell any better and ducking into the men's room, I paused as I gazed about.<br />
<br />
What should have been familiar, the row of urinals being the first thing I saw, struck me as foreign and for a moment, I wrestled with the feeling that I should turn about and head for the woman's toilet before I was caught where I wasn't supposed to me. &quot;After all,&quot; I reasoned as I turned to the row of sinks, briefly taking in the three cubicles that I knew had metal toilets inside. &quot;As a girl, I should be going into the woman's toilet, not the men's loo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stopping before the sinks, it slowly coming to me what it was I was thinking, I shook my head and whispered, &quot;Don't be ridiculous,&quot; as the pressure on my bladder reminded me why it was I came in here.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll prove I'm a boy,&quot; I declared to my reflection and the empty room and turning around, I marched over to the row of urinals, found the one that was lowest to the floor and pushing down on my pants and underwear until they were down around my ankles, I grasped my penis, which I discovered was even smaller and stood in front of the urinal, willing my bladder to release.<br />
<br />
When it finally became apparent that I wasn't going to be able to pee standing up, &quot;It just doesn't feel right,&quot; I thought to myself as I turned away from the urinal, I shuffled toward nearest cubicle and letting myself in, I turned and sat down on the toilet.<br />
<br />
The moment I did, and I had my genitals back between my legs, my bladder released. As I sat there, doing my business, I silently asked myself what was the matter with me and why it was that I suddenly couldn't pee standing up, aware that I was holding my penis so that it was pointing down into the bowl, understanding that if I didn't I would probably spray everything in front of the toilet.<br />
<br />
Grabbing a hand full of toilet paper, without giving it much thought, I began to dab and wipe at myself. When I felt that I was dry enough and wouldn't have any problems, I stood, pulled up my pants and underwear and exited the stall, not even bothering to tuck my genitals back. Stopping in front of the mirror, I reached for the soap dispenser and lathering up, I began to wash my hands. As I did so, I studied my reflection, trying to see if anything else appeared different. When it became clear that nothing had really changed and that my face still had the same round, feminine appearance, I turned away and in a huff, I grabbed at the paper towelling, yanked a couple sheets from the dispenser and proceeded to dry my hands.<br />
<br />
After dumping the damp and wadded paper towelling into the trash, I headed for the exit, wanting only to get out and head back to the hotel. Grasping the door handle, I pulled, but stopped when the door didn't budge. Thinking maybe I was doing something wrong, I tried pushing and when that didn't work, I stepped back, stared at the door for a moment, failed to see anything that would inhibit me and approaching the door again, I tried once again to open it.<br />
<br />
When it became clear that I wasn't going to get out, I turned and peering around the bathroom, I sank to the floor, groaning out, &quot;Great! I've been looked in the men's toilet,&quot; as I did so.</p>
