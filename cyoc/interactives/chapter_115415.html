<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as she wait to get home to try out a spell from the spellbook that the last class today was science. Petra was sitting down in her desk while she was thinking about the spellbook that she always did liked this class. when class was over as Petra headed home from school that she took out the spellbook from her bag, and started to examine it a bit more. thankfully that it was the weekend, but She wanted to try it out on someone as she looked around.<br />
<br />
when she looked out her window while she opened it to the evening night sky is when she found her perfect test subject as it was the cutest boy in school. He was a tall, handsome, slim muscled man as he had short black haircut style with blue eyes. He didn&#39;t had any body hair that Petra had a secret crush on him She then thought that she could change it. She started to look page for page, till she noticed a good change that she found the best one.<br />
<br />
She read the spell from the spellbook out loud while pointing at him. &quot;Tiger Tiger in the depths, places your spirit into thee. as black as night, and white as snow, running through the winter drifts, give this thee the ability to change from humane to thee. strong and powerful, sharp with pointy teeth, still thee. this is my wish, so mote it be.&quot; Nothing happened. Petra was disappointed as She put away the book and looked out the window at him.<br />
<br />
After about five minutes as he was about to leave is when she glanced down at him that She couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. the boy , whose face was so cute before was starting to grow a little stubble on his face while Also, a very light layer of fur on his arms. slowly growing up his arms is when He felt his arms itching as the fur was spreading that he did not realized what is happening. By now his face was also covered in fur.<br />
<br />
running down stairs to meet him that when she opened up the door to see him is when Petra looked down and saw his legs. The once smooth legs were now covered with thick, black and white fur. She was very excited about it as she had a thing for tigers. he then felt the same itching feeling on  his chest too that he started to rub it through his shirt. &quot;Gahh...so itchy.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He slowly started to scratch under his t-shirt and itch his chest, but that&#39;s when he felt something strange under there. now he felt scared as he realized that something is wrong here. He looked down and saw something on his chest. &quot;Woah...Holy crap!?! What the?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
he looked down at his arms too, seeing how hairy they have become. His eyes widen dramatically as he see them that he ran his hand over them. &quot;Oh god... My arms!!&quot; he whispered. He felt how hairy they were as it was so strange for him to touch them, but By now is when his face had changed dramatically too as his skeleton structure has also changed that it gave him mostly tiger feachers while he still has his handsome face, before it was gone. that&#39;s when Petra saw what he was doing when he held the back of his rear as he and Petra knew what was coming, a tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey there cutie!&quot;she yelled to him that he almost slipped backwards.<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; he yelled as he was clearly stressed before running off.<br />
&quot;Wait, I saw what happened to you! please, come into my house, I have something to tell you.&quot; said Petra.<br />
&quot;wait a minute! You...you can help me? &quot; he asked shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, maybe I can.&quot;lied Petra, but in her defense that She didn&#39;t had any idea if this curse was reversible or not. &quot;come on in and I&#39;ll explain everything to you.&quot; she said.<br />
while heading inside her house is when he  felt the same itching feeling on his abs and legs too as Petra saw him now walking on all fours that once inside is when he saw for the first time his own reflection on the wall, but in the mirror is where he see himself turning into a white tiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! What&#39;s happening to me??&quot; he said in a panicing voice &quot;Look at me!!&quot; he rored at Petra when he looked at her. &quot;Well, the is that I found this old book at the library.&quot; Petra said softly while she showed the old book to him. &quot;you see, This is an old spellbook...and I kind of tried a spell on you&quot;<br />
&quot;A spell?&quot; as said surprised as he continued. &quot;well at least i&#39;m not a monkey&#39;s uncle, but This is crazy! What kind of spell did you put on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this spell turns humans into tigers.&quot; Petra said.<br />
&quot;Wait...did you say tigers?? well I guess I can live with that, but Why? Why me?!&quot;<br />
&quot;because You were infront of my house, and you&#39;re the cutest boy in school as your body was so hot to look at...i wanted to keep you by me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait...you think that I&#39;m hot, for real? then Why ruin me, my life?&quot; he said as he could feel his cock starting to stir in his pants that his tail slip out as his pants and underwear then fell off of him. he felt really embarrassed right now that he wanted to hide as he blushed in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know, i just thought that we both have similar interests on tigers, and to be honest with you... I..uh.&quot; she begins to say as she held nothing back when Petra shouted to her secret crush to him. &quot;I have a serious crush with you as I seriously like you. would you please consider staying by my side as a tiger, as well as in my very own home!?&quot; she felt extremely embarrassed as her face was red that even he was shocked by this, but he did felt warm as his clothes that were still on him were feeling uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;wait a minute. you...you had a crush on me?!&quot; He stopped himself from itching. &quot;I also had a crush on you, but I didn&#39;t know how to tell you.&quot; he said while lowering his head.&quot;can you please get this shirt off of me, it itches.&quot; hearing his plea that she teared up his shirt to reveal his massive form. he now looked liked a white tiger that She ran her hands over his fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh&quot; he breathed deeper as Petra ran her hands over him that It was becoming clear to him when he was starting to get excited down there... &quot;well, if i&#39;m going to be living here that I might as well tell you my name, and have a collar around my neck so I don&#39;t scare anybody.&quot; using the old spellbook to change his clothing into a black leaver collar with diamonds around it that she then asked for his name, so she can engrave the collar with his name. &quot;my name is Conner, and I hope this doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;m going to vets, the circus, or even the zoo.&quot; sliding on the collar that He got aroused as the mirror on the wall was showing the same thing.</p>
