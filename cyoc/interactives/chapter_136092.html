<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the Everson siblings and Skyla, morning came all too soon, even sooner for Skyla considering she had to get up earlier than the rest. She felt like a zombie. But duty called. <br />
<br />
Curt&#39;s dreams meanwhile were filled with furry tails, soft whispers... And with houses bursting out of the ground out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
Curt hoped that all this new luxury and eager ladies didn&#39;t utterly corrupt him. At least he wasn&#39;t likely to get so bored that he turned to trying to summoning ancient forgotten world ending horrors as a hobby or something. <br />
<br />
He looked outside to see the lionesses were back at work, he hoped against hope that they hadn&#39;t worked through the night! Dedication was one thing but he didn&#39;t want them to work themselves to death!<br />
<br />
Anna meanwhile, was looking over the ray gun in her hands... she hadn&#39;t thought about it before... but she didn&#39;t have a job, that hadn&#39;t mattered to her when she was, different, but now it was an itch she couldn&#39;t scratch. She&#39;d been remade to look after her brother&#39;s wants and needs. What he&#39;d want most of course was for her to be happy, but now that her head was so much more clear, just sitting around doing nothing but enjoying the luxury the ray gun had provided was tempting, but felt kinda hollow. <br />
<br />
She texted her friends, asking them where they could meet. Whether she had the ray gun with her or not, she still owed it visit them after practically forgetting about them! She was sure to feed Noni, who most definitely WAS enjoying all the new perks. <br />
<br />
The three &#39;in the know&#39; to the changes in reality, along with the rest on the maid&#39;s general e-mailing list, got a message from Marceline... Her band had gotten a quick gig at a beach house for some frat boys. There was no doubt Anna, Curt, or Skyla&#39;s mind about where the ray gun was going to be that afternoon. <br />
Curt felt there wasn&#39;t really a need to just zap people for the sake of zapping them at this point, and he hoped Leo and Kitty were a good sign that Anna and Skyla were toning down their games. But the realistic part of him knew Skyla would want to &#39;upgrade&#39; Marceline&#39;s band mates regardless. It would make a nice second date with Danelle if she could find the time two nights in a row. And if he was there, Skyla wouldn&#39;t be turning the entire beach house into a maid house. <br />
<br />
Curt thought about something, and sent out two private emails on the mailing list, hoping this would work out for the better. <br />
<br />
He also got an email from Meredith, who had clearly taken the role of personal assistant, that the Simone&#39;s recital was on school talent night on Monday night, and this was Friday, Curt promised he&#39;d get to work on getting the time... He imagined with his new status and wealth, he could arrange the extra couple hours... privileges he might as well use. <br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s breakfast was exceptional as usual, with the bunnies all chipping in, they more mouths to feed after all. The lionesses ate like a small military unit. Most of the maids ate before or after Curt did, but in keeping with Curt&#39;s personality, none felt ashamed or wrong eating with him. He wouldn&#39;t be Curt if he had objected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Big brother...&quot; Anna asked after breakfast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Anna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I please have the use of the ray gun today? I promise I won&#39;t zap everyone I see... I just want... to give my friends a chance to be helped like you helped me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Curt said at once. &quot;Go right ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna hugged him. &quot;Thank you Big Brother!&quot; <br />
<br />
Curt wasn&#39;t worried about being late like yesterday, and with the toys he saw moving in, he guessed that Kitty and Leo&#39;s families were being moved in next. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan works fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master,&quot; said the kitten, startling Curt. &quot;I&#39;m very proud of myself. I&#39;ve already offered the new staff to help sell their houses on the open market, since they&#39;ve accepted the &#39;live in&#39; option of their contracts. The people I directed them towards are trustworthy and effective. I just finished getting the signatures from the lionesses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t work yourself to death, you&#39;re young. I&#39;m honestly worried that we&#39;re rushing things lately, pushing things too far, not giving time for us to get settled in.&quot;<br />
<br />
  &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind Master, though everything has been smooth sailing for you. Like fate itself wants you to live like a king. Or at least about two-dozen very productive women do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt felt a little disgusted at that. &quot;I&#39;d rather earn it personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, who earns where they are in life anymore? Poor families can&#39;t afford expensive schools for their children, while rich families can. And nepotism is how most get their first job anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... That&#39;s rather cynical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just being realistic Master. I&#39;d better get to the officer Master, if you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan waited. Curt realized she meant that literally.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re excused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master, oh, and you need to try the hot tub for yourself.&quot; She finished the sentence with a decidedly kitten smile before running off with her wheeled briefcase to where a black car was waiting for her, her one of her bodyguards driving.<br />
<br />
&#39;We have a hot tub now?&#39; Curt wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready when you are Master!&quot; Meredith skipped up to him with lunch and folders in tow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Meredith, if Leo and Kitty are going to be moving in, and their families, I want to welcome them formally into the house, I&#39;d like you arrange things for them after I get back from Marceline&#39;s concert this afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Wouldn&#39;t Headmaid Skyla be a better pick? I wouldn&#39;t mind going to one of Marceline&#39;s concerts myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She... needs some special time. And I trust you more than any of the maids after Skyla and Anna to organize things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Meredith blushed, not able to look her Master in the eyes. &quot;What about Security Chief Pamela?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, she&#39;s security. I want this to be a social event.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meredith locked her legs together and saluted. &quot;I won&#39;t let you down Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you won&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt took the lunch and folders, and was off to work once again. <br />
<br />
Skyla had gotten the last of the paper work she&#39;d gotten from Morgan copied and organized and uploaded when there was a knock on her door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Head Maid Skyla, Susan and Vicky are here to see you, on Master&#39;s orders,&quot; Called out Rachel&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Send them in,&quot; said Skyla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually they&#39;re waiting at the front door for you,&quot; said the wolf girl maid.<br />
<br />
Well this was weird. <br />
<br />
Skyla headed downstairs, the lionesses giving her a quick greetings as she passed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Head Maid Skyla!&quot; said the mail vixen, Vicky, except now she was truly naked, not wearing her mail hat. <br />
<br />
&quot;NIce to see you here,&quot; said Susan with a smile. &quot;Master told us you were feeling low, and told us to help you unwind today with a &#39;vixen&#39;s only&#39; trip around town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla startled. &quot;But... but... I have Kitty I need to start teaching! So many new maids to orient! So much to do!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Which is WHY Master told us to be here,&quot; said Vicky. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing we both happened to have the day off isn&#39;t it?&quot; Susan said in that &#39;no way this is a coincidence&#39; voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUT YOU&#39;RE BOTH CIVIL SERVANTS! There&#39;s no way in Jigoku you could just be given a day off tra-la-la!&quot; <br />
<br />
Susan shrugged. &quot;One of the guys at the bus depot volunteered to pull a double shift just for me.&quot; Susan gave a sultry smile that made even Skyla a bit weak in the knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve built up some vacation time,&quot; Vicky said like that explained everything. It didn&#39;t. &quot;And I called in a few favors.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both vixens took Skyla by the arms and began to pull her along. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now come along, Master told us to make sure you enjoyed today, and we&#39;re going to see that happens!&quot; Susan said. <br />
<br />
&quot;But-but-&quot; Skyla stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be such an old lady,&quot; Vicky said. <br />
<br />
Skyla snarled, her voice taking on a dark echoing tone, shadowing lengthening around her, blue flames forming on the tips of her tails. &quot;[i]Ever call me that again, and you can both be short stack &#39;good fortune&#39; statues decorating the front yard![/i]&quot; <br />
<br />
The other vixens let go. The darkness and flames instantly went away. Even the lionesses momentarily stopped their tireless work to stare at their head maid... not in fear... but in concern. Everyone&#39;s fur was standing on ends. <br />
<br />
As for Skyla herself, she covered her mouth. &quot;G-girls... I... I didn&#39;t mean it. I swear it.&quot; Skyla&#39;s eyes misted slightly. The worst part was that made her sick to her stomach was that she wasn&#39;t sure if she was lying or not. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Skyla...&quot; Susan said. &quot;I know this is a dumb question, but are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla&#39;s tails lowered. &quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danielle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky and Susan hugged the older fox. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s try Master&#39;s bar,&quot; Susan said. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The bar, Tropico Perfecta, was far from big, far from fancy, and far from being in the best part of town. Skyla was sure it was owned or bar tended by one of the lionesses before yesterday. <br />
<br />
Skyla looked into the big reflective glass behind the bar. Seeing two naked vixens on her left and right, this made her the odd one out. <br />
<br />
&#39;I could use the ray gun, change the setting from &#39;nude&#39; to &#39;maid&#39;, and they&#39;d never know the difference... But, this is who they are now, as part of the family...  And then, why not just make myself the nude? No. View of my body&#39;s beauty is an honor.&#39; <br />
<br />
The truly impressive part was while they were getting looks, it was no more than you&#39;d ever expect from three attractive ladies, not two nudists, let alone three fox people! <br />
<br />
Skyla wished she had the ray gun, the poor inexperienced guy behind the bar clearly could use an upgrade, in fact, so could pretty much every person in this dive if she did say so herself. <br />
<br />
Three fox women, one dressed as a maid, two others naked, and one a kitsune, Skyla wondered if anyone had done any quality furry art of THAT! <br />
<br />
Keeping Skyla away from the strong stuff, Susan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skyla, do you think Master doesn&#39;t love you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Of course not.&quot; Skyla shuddered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love Master right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t even a question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are you unhappy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... What&#39;s wrong with me? Why her? Why not me? Does Master have a thing for donkeys? I could be a jenny if I wanted! I can be anything he wants me to be!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you be a friend?&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla startled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We all love Master Skyla,&quot; Susan gave her a hug. &quot;You think I don&#39;t feel the same? Well, I guess not exactly the same. There are lots of types of love after all. I kept wondering why you never made your move. Danielle did. So she gets her chance to swing. Besides, there&#39;s nothing to say you still can&#39;t make your move. Why not just share?&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla started. &quot;If it came down to it, I admit, I could,&quot; she knew it was the transformation talking, but she didn&#39;t in particular care. &quot;Though, I&#39;m worried Curt might be overwhelmed by it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s how you feel, if that&#39;s how you REALLY feel, then accept it, and support Master with what makes him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should remember what Master told me once.&quot; Skyla startled, she nearly forgot Vicky was even there, the mail vixen had been so quiet. &quot;He told me, &#39;never forget to include what makes you happy too.&#39;&quot; Vicky spun the ice cubes in her glass. <br />
<br />
&quot;What makes him happy is what makes me happy,&quot; Skyla said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; Susan whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the paradox with Master,&quot; Vicky downed her drink. &quot;If he was the kinda guy who&#39;d WANT a buncha gorgeous women to tend to his every whim like a french monarch with nothing in return... would he be the guy who we love?&quot; <br />
<br />
Skyla thought about it. &quot;Maybe not... but I&#39;d want to serve him anyway. A maid has her reason for being after all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t have to be the only reason sweetie,&quot; Susan said. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; Cassidy said, having once again insisted on going with Anna everywhere she went, Master&#39;s orders. Master&#39;s orders were Master&#39;s orders, but Anna wished her brother didn&#39;t treat her like she still had problems. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Cassidy,&quot; Anna said, checking out the old video arcade. <br />
<br />
Anna hadn&#39;t been retarded, but she had learning problems. Sadly, lots of people at school hasn&#39;t know the difference. Her little naive self had gone INTO the actually retarded classroom on lunch break because it had a sega genesis... and B followed A. <br />
<br />
Now that she&#39;d never had her problems, she wondered how in this new reality she&#39;d met her friends, who had been in the same &#39;home room&#39; as her... Anna had been so naive... not that those around her helped... She had no idea there was anything &#39;wrong&#39; with her... She didn&#39;t know why her parents wanted her to get out of the classroom with her friends... Then she was slowly introduced to real classes, and reality came down with a hammer. <br />
<br />
&quot;You said you wanted to catch up with the girls you met while getting extra credit for volunteer work?&quot; Cassidy asked. <br />
<br />
So that answered that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And they&#39;re not &#39;the girls I met&#39; they&#39;re my friends Cassidy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
A silver blue van drove, and the side door opened, Anna recognized it as belonging to Misty&#39;s parents. <br />
<br />
&quot;Misty, Ashley!&quot; Anna waved to them. <br />
<br />
Ashley got out of the van first. &quot;Thanks for the ride Mr. Autumn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure Ashley.&quot;<br />
<br />
Misty came out next. <br />
<br />
Black haired Ashley was in a blue dress, while orange haired Misty in yellow shorts and a point long sleeve shirt. <br />
<br />
The man in the driver&#39;s seat turned to Anna. &quot;Anna, thanks for giving the girls this trip, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they will too,&quot; Anna said, a strangeness in spite of her new reality of now being expected to look after her friends. But if they accepted her offer, that wouldn&#39;t be a problem for long. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun girls!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bye dad!&quot; Misty said as he drove off. <br />
<br />
The girls were in their early 20s, like Anna, with Misty being several months older than Anna. <br />
<br />
“Hi Misty!  Hi Ashley!  Boy it feels like a long time since I’ve seen you two, things have been so busy the last few days.  How have you been?”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been pretty bored,” Ashley said, “My big sis went back to college, and I haven’t had a lot of people to hang out with.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a good thing you can hang out with us, then,”  Misty smiled.  &quot;I was starting to worried you&#39;d gotten into a car accident or something Anna, when you stopped returning my emails for two days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I&#39;m sorry, we&#39;ve been hiring new maids at the mansion and checking my personal messages slipped my mind, I&#39;m really really sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think your big brother can buy some arcade machines?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Your brother is super rich right? I love that playstation 5 plus you have! Though Nintendo is more fun.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna wondered, &#39;How many maids would need to be zapped before arcade machines became a normal sight in the game room?&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t put it past him eventually,&quot; Anna said. <br />
<br />
“So what are we gonna do first?”  Misty asked.  “I’d kinda like to try one of the dancing games.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Ashley said.  “You’ve got the passes, right Anna?”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, here you go.”  Anna handed a pair of cards to her friends.  She sighed internally.  She felt so excited to have someone she could share these changes with, someone who she KNEW would enjoy them as much as she did, and she wanted to do it as soon as possible, but with Cassidy breathing down her neck, it was gonna be tricky.  She could only imagine that if she tried to explain while Cassidy was in earshot, the tigress would take her aside and scold her for giving these two &#39;false hope.&#39; <br />
<br />
It was almost strange how her friends didn&#39;t give Cassidy a second look, in this new reality Anna knew, Cassidy must have been a constant whenever she went out... While Cassidy just politely stayed silent, keeping an eye out for trouble and making sure trouble saw her. <br />
<br />
Anna headed into the arcade, the two young women and the tigress following after her.  The place was as noisy as ever, with dozens of machines loudly competing for a player’s attention, and seemingly just as much noise from players conversing while trying to make themselves heard over the machines.  Well, if she could get Cassidy to stand even a few feet away, there wouldn’t be any worry about the tigress overhearing thing in this place.<br />
<br />
Cassidy had more sensitive ears, but so did Anna, if she could barely hear herself over this noise, then she could be assured that Cassidy wouldn&#39;t, and Cassidy wouldn&#39;t even remember the conversation after reality changed. <br />
<br />
The girls each had a few rounds on the dance machines, Ashley doing fairly well, and Misty doing rather poorly, to her frustration, while Anna discovered that, if her new form had granted her any sort of feline grace, it did not translate into improved rhythm game skills.  They moved to a ‘light gun’ shooter next, a fighter after that, which Ashley again dominated, finally, they surrendered their hard earned tokens to the gobbling horror that is a co-op fantasy semi-2-D hack and slash. <br />
<br />
After their last tokens had vanished, the three picked up some snacks, and had a seat at one of the tables dotted around the place.  Cassidy excused herself to the restroom, and Anna grinned giddily.  She barely even waited for the tigress to get out of earshot before she spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley, Misty, there’s something I wanted to ask you.  Have you ever wanted to be…  Well, like me?  An animal person, I mean?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Ashley said, “it looks like it’d be a lot of fun to have all that fluff and a tail, and to not have people bother you if you wanna go around naked.”  She giggled.  “Yeah.  Maybe not a cat, but I think it’d be fun.  Being a bird would be cool.”<br />
<br />
“How about you, Misty?”<br />
<br />
“I guess?  I never thought about it before.  I mean, you’re really cute, and I wouldn’t mind that, I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Well,”  Anna took a deep breath, this would be a bit trickier to say in this timeline than it would have been in her original one, “I know you both have had some difficulties, and you both don’t like to have them brought up, especially Misty.  But if you could cure them, permanently, would you want to?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!”  Misty said emphatically, &quot;Right here, right now, if I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe.&quot; Ashley said. &quot;If I&#39;m still me, it might be okay. ... It would be nice though, not to have stuff feel like nonsense...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you had to help around the house at my brother&#39;s, and move in with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW? REALLY? That sounds like fun!&quot; Ashley said. <br />
<br />
&quot;It... might be nice... and get away from all the shouting,&quot; Misty whispered. <br />
<br />
“Then there’s something I’d like to show you.”  Anna reached into her bag, and pulled out the gun.<br />
<br />
“Neat, that looks like something from the black and white movies my parents watch on weekends,”  Ashley said.<br />
<br />
<br />
“This ray gun here is actually able to do everything I talked about.  But it’s an all-or-nothing thing.  It can fix your… difficulties, and it can turn you into any kind of animal person.  And it makes it so people think it’d always been that way.  And it also makes it so you can get a job at my brother’s house.”<br />
<br />
“That last part seems a little weird,” Ashley said, “But that sounds really cool!”<br />
<br />
“You’re not trying to do some prank are you?”  Misty asked.  “I mean, it sounds nice, and I know you don’t lie to us normally, but I think it all seems weird.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know it’s pretty weird, but it’s true.  I used to be human, and had the same classes as you in school.  But then my brother found this, and changed me, and now well, it made me into what I am, and it helped me with my problems.” <br />
<br />
Misty took a deep breath.  “Alright!  I’ll try it. I want to be able to do things on my own, and not have everyone look down on me.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?”  Anna asked, “There’s no going back to being human once it happens.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Just…  Please…  Don’t let this be a lie…”<br />
<br />
“And what about you, Ashley?”  Anna asked.<br />
<br />
“If she’s gonna do it, I definitely will.  We’re best friends forever!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, here goes!”  Anna set species and busty/cutie to “target’s favorite,” then set the “Change Awareness” setting out of it’s default “Off.” And Anna, being Anna, and with the remark from one of her friends, set the Maid/Nude toggle to &#39;Nude.&#39;   Two arcs of blue lightning flew from the gun in quick succession striking the young ladies instantly.<br />
<br />
Misty’s change started first, feeling warm as a tingling sensation seemed to erupt all over her skin.  Any hair she currently had rapidly turned black, as more and more of it grew in, covering her whole torso in black fur.  Seemingly in response, her clothes seemed to just unravel, before dissipating into nothing. Misty realized, on some level, that she would have normally been horribly embarrassed to suddenly be naked in public, but she simply found it didn’t matter to her anymore.  She had her fur, and that was enough. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it…  It’s really happening!”  Her body shifted significantly, her hips becoming noticeably wider, and her waist thinner.  Misty blushed as she felt a weight building in her chest, glancing down and seeing her bust slowly swelling in front of her, yet never straining her back.  Anna hadn’t mentioned anything like this!  Though, at the same time, Misty couldn’t complain.  She hadn’t been able to get into the dating scene before.  One of many things her disability denied her.  But with a body like this?  She’d turn heads wherever she went!<br />
<br />
Her arms, meanwhile were soon covered in soft, black fur.  When the fur reached her hands, each one changed further as it was covered; soft pads bulged out of her palms and the underside of her fingertips.  Her fingernails, meanwhile shrank back into nothing.  In their place, sharp claws poked through, before quickly retracting away.  Misty focused on the strange new sensation, retracting and extending them several times.  Her legs changed much the same way her arms did, though they seems to shift their mass slightly as the black fur spread over them, giving the woman a nimble, catlike spring in her step.  Her feet grew a few inches longer, and the bones altered to make a digitigrade stance more natural.  <br />
<br />
The fur spread up over Misty’s neck, soon enveloping her head completely.  She felt her jaws stretching forward two inches, her teeth spreading out as they grew longer and sharper, and her tongue becoming rougher.  Her nose turned black, and wet, pressing into a cute triangle shape.  Her hair had already turned black, and shrunk to match the rest of her fur, giving her a slight “bald” look.  Her ears bent into a triangular shape, slowly moving up the sides of her head, while her eyes turned a bright, yellowish-green.  Finally, she felt a sort of tugging behind her, as a long, thin tail, covered in the same black fur that had spread over all her body.  <br />
<br />
Ashley, meanwhile, found her body becoming a little rounder, an odd pressing feeling appearing all over her body as hundreds of feathers grew out of her skin.  Her clothing, too, unraveled and vanished.  Even if she had been joking when she made her earlier comment, she didn’t feel ashamed.  In fact, she felt like she had one less thing weighing her down, now.  Her legs became much thinner, the skin there taking a scaly texture.  Her feet seemed to shrink while each of her toes grew longer, more than making up for the reduced foot size.  On each foot, her little toe (though now they was just as long as the others,) seemed to shift around to the back.  Her toenails vanished.  In their place, the bones in her toes grew longer, sharpening as they painlessly stretched out of her skin, becoming a set of little talons.  Ashley raised a leg to get a closer look, wiggling her new extremities to test them.<br />
<br />
As she did, she subconsciously shifted her weight to stay balanced as her tail feathers grew in, fanning out above her rear.  Their light grey feathers, which also covered much of her back, contrasted well with the pale yellow on the front of her torso.  Ashley got into a normal standing position her tail feathers fanned downward, almost looking like half a skirt.  She felt a tingle in her arms next, and gazed at them in anticipation.  Her arms felt as if they were getting a little longer at first though as hundreds of grey feathers grew out, her new wings soon looked wide and beautiful.  <br />
<br />
“This is so cool!”   She whispered.  For a moment, she couldn’t feel her fingers, but after trying to wiggle them again she found that the feathers at the tip of her wings seemed to bend at her thoughts, just like fingers.  She experimentally reached out, and picked up the candy bar she had set on the table, wish just as much ease as she always had.<br />
<br />
Grey feathers spread over her head, with a hint of yellow under the chin.  He head grew rounder, and her neck thicker, which, combined with the layer of feathers, and rounder figure, made it a little difficult to tell where her body stopped and her head began.  Ashley’s ears shrank quickly, becoming little more than small holes in the side of her head.  Her hair, similarly, shrank away replaced by a simple covering of feathers.  Her nose seemed to vanish, and her teeth receded, while her jaws stretched out four inches, forming a relatively short beak, little nostril openings forming near the back.  The newly-made Magnolia Warbler looked over her body, then her friend’s, in awe.<br />
<br />
Their new bodies began to feel more and more natural, and at the same time, a strange feeling of clarity dawned on them, as if a fog had been lifted in their mind. And silently, both came to the same conclusion; Curt may have just been an acquaintance to them before, but he had found this valuable tool, and allowed his sister to share it with them.  He was ultimately responsible for their brilliant new bodies, and lives, and they couldn’t just take that for granted.  Anna had mentioned working for him earlier, and the two didn’t even have to think about it.  They would happily call him Master, and treat him with the respect such a title deserved, as loyal friends to the end.<br />
<br />
“Anna…”  Misty stammered,  “I…  I feel amazing!”  The black cat woman rushed to hug her siamese friend.<br />
<br />
Ashley wasted no time in joining her BFFs in a hug, either.  “Thank you, so so much!  I look so freakin’ cute!  And Misty, she looks amazing too!”  <br />
<br />
Anna grinned wide.  She had never seen her friends this happy!  “I’m glad to help,” she said, returning the hugs.  “So, are you two ready for a tour of your new home?”<br />
<br />
“New home?  What’re you talking about?”  Cassidy said, stepping up to the table.<br />
<br />
“Cassidy!”  Anna said.  “Oh, it must be all the noise.  I was asking the girls if they were ready to head home.”<br />
<br />
“Right, my bad,” Cassidy said.  “I’ll be happy to drive you guys back.”<br />
<br />
The girls quickly agreed, and started on their way out. <br />
<br />
“Cassidy and the maids don’t know about our little gift,” Anna explained to her friends in a quiet whisper, being as nonspecific as possible in case Cassidy could hear them over the lingering noise of the arcade.  “Try not to bring up the original version to anyone but Master and Head Maid Skyla, okay?”  Ashley and Misty nodded. <br />
<br />
While putting one of the left over treats in her bag, Anna found a photograph of her and her two friends, grinning, naked anthro teenagers, standing in front of the mansion with the words &#39;Just moved in!&#39; written on the front in sparkling pen. Checking the back, Anna saw it was dated three years ago! She flashed it to her friends, who made small gasps at the sight. <br />
<br />
As the group piled into the car, Ashley hesitated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you girls all go ahead... with erm, the traffic I think I can make it back to the house before you,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
Misty and Anna grinned, knowing the real reason. <br />
<br />
Cassidy laughed. &quot;Ashley, if you want an excuse to go for a flight, you can just say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay!&quot; Ashley startled but then smiled and nodded. Ashley and Anna waited with baited breath while Cassidy casually closed the car door and started the engined. <br />
<br />
Being second nature to her, Ashley spread her wings, crotched down, then sprange up, the naked bird woman taking off magnificently into the air, this actually getting some attention from those around her. Ashley couldn&#39;t stop herself from laughing as she spin and did cartwheels in mid-air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze, how much sugar did she have?&quot; Cassidy remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; Anna covered. <br />
<br />
As the car drove along, Anna and Misty looked up through the windows at Ashley, who was testing her wings for all they were worth. Apparently even the all mighty reality recons and perception filters couldn&#39;t stop people from being in awe at the flying naked bird woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy is that an angel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dear.&quot; Anna&#39;s feline ears picked up as they drove by a family on the sidewalk. <br />
<br />
Ashley might have easily out-flown them back to the estate, if she hadn&#39;t been taking the most squiggly line possible in 3-D space to get there. As it was, they arrived at the estate at the same time. <br />
<br />
Anna noted that they now had a quasi-third floor, the roof was now slanted at an angle at windows. There was also now a nude angel vixen and dragon gargoyle statues at the corners. <br />
<br />
&#39;That from just Ashley and Misty? Or did it build up from the lionesses yesterday?&#39; Anna knew she&#39;d never know. <br />
<br />
The lionesses were still hard at work, but the pink and purple ones were taking a break. <br />
<br />
Ashley landed next to the gargoyles checking them out, before landing in the front yard as the car was parked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat you,&quot; Ashley giggled.<br />
<br />
Cassidy just smiled good naturedly. <br />
<br />
The lionesses gave Ashley a polite wave. <br />
<br />
Ashley and Misty remembered the mansion already, but they still felt a tingling in their stomachs that had nothing to do with magic or mad science, at the idea how they themselves now lived here, and HAD lived here for the last three years! <br />
<br />
The four hadn&#39;t even gotten back inside yet when Meredith stormed out. Her fur looked frazzled, and the normally reserved and meek mouse maid said exasperated. &quot;I am happy to see you&#39;re all back! I hope you enjoyed your extra day off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meredith, is something wrong?&quot; Anna asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong? Nothing&#39;s wrong! Head Maid Skyla just had a sudden vacation day too, Master&#39;s orders, and he left me to arrange a &#39;welcome to the mansion&#39; event TONIGHT for Susan&#39;s and Leo&#39;s families and for our new security staff! All in one day! I appreciate how much Master believes in me, but I&#39;m not a miracle worker!&quot; Meredith panted. Then her eyes widened and she instantly locked her legs together and blowed as low as her spine allowed. &quot;This humble maid apologizes for her outburst Miss Anna, it will not happen again, this lowly servant promises, please do not be angry with her! She lives to serve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassidy had a worried look in her eyes. Ashley and Misty looked at each other. Anna said, &quot;I&#39;ll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Anna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Anna, we&#39;re all maids here aren&#39;t we? So that means I help around here too!&quot; Anna put a hand on Meredith&#39;s shoulder, the mouse maid couldn&#39;t hide the relief that flooded over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna turned to her friends.  “Are you two ready to help out?”<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet!&quot; Misty said, it was like she had been born for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Anna, I mean Anna,&quot; Ashley said with a smile, they were friends and fellow maids, but she WAS Master&#39;s sister, but at the same time, she wasn&#39;t deaf, she heard Anna not liking being called that. &quot;I&#39;m ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
The four spent the next hour in the third floor meeting room (which Anna was sure hadn&#39;t existed before), by the end, their brains were as fried as Meledith&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Anna didn&#39;t know it, but she now had an appreciation for Skyla&#39;s desire to stick with &#39;retcon employment.&#39;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lot of pizza to order,&quot; Anna observed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Janet will kill us if we order out instead of letting her make it,&quot; Meredith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But with the rabbits helping with the moving and everyone else doing double shifts keeping the house together, how can she make that much by herself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is where you three fine ladies come in. Be sure to wear gloves so you don&#39;t get fur in everything.&quot;</p>
