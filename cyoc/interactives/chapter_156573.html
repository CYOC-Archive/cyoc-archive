<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam was a Deputy with the local Sheriffs department. <br />
<br />
About 5 foot 2 inches tall she was used to working as a part time detective.  Her family was from Pakistan and she was a Khan, a legacy of some Mongol blood. 9/11 had her working at school pursuing a degree in medicine. Her father pushed for her to join the Army and serve, she saw how Bush was going with his wars and chose the local police service. That would make her exempt from any drafts the US might pull off. <br />
<br />
With jet black hair, smouldering looks her part white heritage had given her a 36D chest. She modeled to pay for her tuition through college. After finishing her degree she found that she liked the dual nature. Model at night and cop by day. People couldn&#39;t see the connection. <br />
<br />
Makeup free with her hair slicked back into a bun, a bra that flattened her chest and a spotless deputy&#39;s uniform people couldn&#39;t see her on instagram. When in the lunch room the boys drooled over her insta feed, only to not realize that she their co-worker. They knew her first name was Samreena and she was Iranian or something hence they didn&#39;t touch her.<br />
<br />
She had had a few offers but she had kept to her work. The Sheriff was a black woman in her 40s and she fully supported Sam&#39;s double life. When  Joel&#39;s mother needed comfort Sam had been assigned. Joel&#39;s mother, to her credit, didn&#39;t dispute the fact that her son was a rapist (maybe) but denied that this was a suicide. Whoever had done the job had done it well enough that it looked like a suicide but wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
She started reviewing the file, which had been closed, including unidentified fingerprints. Sam pulled some strings and got the prints developed by the forensic technicians.  &quot;Weird Sam, the fingerprints, based on the ridges are that of a female, aged somewhere between 20-40 based on the lack of calluses I could narrow it down to 20-30 years of age.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The suicide note?&quot; Sam asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Same prints. Re-examination of the x-rays shows that the neck was broken by the application of blunt trauma like a person wringing a chicken&#39;s neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took the fingerprints and with a flash of her badge made the connection to the school Joel and Heather attended. Understanding that Heather was a well developed young teen she believed that the vigilante had used Heather as some kind of cover to help the real killer get inside Joel&#39;s house. Sam appealed to Heather&#39;s sense of guilt, she tried telling her that police were interested in Joel Rodney&#39;s crimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman sounds cool but he would be arrested in the real world. You are at the age where you can be arrested as an accessory after the fact.&quot; <br />
<br />
With shaking hands she went to a friend&#39;s and rang Ben...<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s modelling and police work left her drained. She was as straight as arrow shaft, she hadn&#39;t been with a man for two years. Her hunky neighbor Bryan had taken no notice of her. Bryan was involved with a busty blond who played beach volleyball. As she touched the doorknob to her apartment it was laced with Desire. <br />
<br />
At 2 am her doorbell rang. She looked through the peephole and saw Bryan, her nipples stiffened and a moistness grew in between her legs. Bryan explained that Charlene, stripper name Candy, had been taking guys home from the club. <br />
<br />
&quot;Exposing her skin is like one thing, letting them inside her is another thing altogether.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, it is...illegal in this state and pretty every other one.&quot; Sam said sleepily. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am down with feminism, like you...&quot; Bryan added sheepishly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What!?!&quot; Sam covered her huge tits with her hand as if offended.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you are a cop and a model. What is the difference between firefighters or Navy SEALs appearing in a photoshoot? Does it affect their brain?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding vigorously Sam agreed as she made coffee. He drank it and left with a copy of her keys.<br />
<br />
The next day she returned from visiting her mother, at over 30 she was being pestered about children. She was frustrated and pissed at the stalled Rodney investigation. She walked into her apartment and found Bryan in between her sheets. <br />
<br />
Part of her wanted to throw him out the window, but further down her desire? told her to let him stay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go back to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
She unbuttoned her uniform and her breasts encased in a white nude bra that hugged her body. Her muscles flexed as she moved to have a shower. Soon they were fucking, she sat in his lap as his penis entered her. She moaned as the sheets had been pushed back. Two years, she thought since she had been fucked by something other than a dildo.<br />
<br />
Bryan was barrel chested, with a stylish goatee, several tattoos and a flattop hair cut. He had been a Marine in Iraq she remembered.  <br />
<br />
Her hands loosely cupped Bryan&#39;s face. He looked at her as if he were sizing up game, her vagina, her drooping tits and her jet black hair as he increased his thrusts. She wanted him, her legs were open and wrapped around his trunk. But his sudden plunge caught her off guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
Her breasts wobbled as she braced herself against his neck. He wrapped himself around her life a python.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her body was riding his dick so high that her breasts were mashed into his face. Her face was looking like someone fighting a sneeze. <br />
<br />
Bryan climaxed inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot; she moaned as she deflated. <br />
<br />
Her arms around him, her breasts heaving in his face she rested her head on his shoulder. <br />
 <br />
Sam realized something was wrong, his body seemed fake, hollow somehow. <br />
<br />
As she overcame her own over the top orgasm she looked him in the eyes, then she cupped his face and gave him the most passionate kiss she could muster. Nothing.<br />
<br />
She guided him onto his back and he offered no resistance for a man two heads taller than her. Her sweaty tits wobbling she kissed him again, feeling his penis, it felt smaller than she would expect. <br />
<br />
Sam reached for a pack of cigarettes and offer him one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t if I were you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once every two years.&quot; she laughed nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Try 20 for statutory rape.&quot; Bryan replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; she gasped as he started to shimmer and blur like he was pixelated.<br />
<br />
From a 29 year old with bronzed skin and hard hands from working construction to a pasty white underdeveloped teenage boy. <br />
<br />
She ripped off a sheet and covered her nude body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like this blackmail, extortion or just the facts of life. You threatened Heather and she called me, so here is my response on her behalf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben stated that she had seduced him when visiting the school. He knew it was wrong and had a video of them fucking, a sex tape, &quot;actually a .mp4 these days&quot; he added casually. Showing her the video on an iPad he explained that it had been live streamed. Statutory rape had life in their state, as a police officer she had a position of authority and she was obsessed with the suicide of Joel Rodney.<br />
<br />
Best case she would loose her job, be fired and spend time in a sex offenders treatment plan while under house detention. Worse case &quot;Orange is the new Black&quot; for 20 years until at the MDC until released.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you can stay away from Heather, leave the case alone and continue on your normal way. Suicide or leaving the police is also acceptable.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;SO how is Heather involved in the death of Joel Jonathan Rodney?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not and neither are you...&quot; <br />
<br />
Sam managed to keep the tears back until he got dressed and the teen boy left her apartment. She couldn&#39;t help but notice he wiped the fingerprints off the door knob. However she had a rape kit and he wasn&#39;t wearing a condom....</p>
