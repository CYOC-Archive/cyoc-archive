<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete heard a distant howling coming from the construction site. He peered through the murky window into the darkness to see if he could spot the source. Being afraid of dogs, he decided to remain inside his office van. Pete strained his ears to locate the dog, but all was calm. A cricket chirped softly, breaking the silence. Breathing out slowly in relief, Pete slumped back into his chair and loosened his tie a little to cool off. A crashing sound immediately filled the air; Pete fell backwards in surprise out of his chair. Peeking over the top of his desk at the window, Pete saw two muscular men, wearing only red Speedos, clawing at the window to get in. He noticed one of them poking the other and pointing out the door to the office. Smiling, they both disappeared from the window. Pete dove across his desk and landed at the door to the office; the handle was twisting slowly. Pete threw his weight against the door and locked it. <br />
<br />
Pete could hear them at the door, shoving it violently in an attempt to get in. They must be some gang or something, he convinced himself. Some bizarre gang. Sighing, Pete glanced around his office and spotted his phone sitting on the floor, having been knocked off his desk. He picked up the receiver and called the police.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, what seems to be the problem?&quot; came a friendly voice at the other end of the line.<br />
&quot;Listen, I'm trapped in my office by two guys wearing Speedos, can you please help me?&quot; he asked hurriedly.<br />
&quot;Okay, calm down. Where are you?&quot; the voice returned.<br />
Pete slowed down and gave the address of the construction site, uttered a quick thank-you and put the phone back down. All he had to do now was wait, he thought as he watched the door rattle again.<br />
<br />
Several minutes later, the door stopped shaking. Pete heard a car pull into the parking lot. He smiled in relief; the police must have scared the men away. A knocking at the door made him jump suddenly, but he heard the voice of a police man asking if there was anyone in the office.<br />
<br />
Pete opened the door slowly, just to be sure. He could see a man in his 30s wearing a police uniform standing patiently at the door. Pete opened the door widely, extending his hand to greet and thank the police man. Before the police man could reach out and take his hand, a large body flew past the door, knocking the police man to the dirt. It was one of the Speedo clad men. The second ran past the door, ignoring Pete and diving onto the police man's chest, pinning him to the floor.<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; the police man shouted in anger as he struggled to throw the two men off of his body. Pete stood at the door, unsure of how to react. What came next only confounded him further:<br />
<br />
One of the men turned to the other and began to stroke his penis through the Speedo and muttered something quietly. The one being stroked smiled and nodded slowly. One moment later, the one being stroked wrapped his arms around the police officer's head and bit into his neck. Pete stepped backwards in shock as the police man began to moan in pain. The two Speedo Men got up slowly, allowing the police officer a chance to escape, but he didn't budge from the ground. <br />
“Bloody mongrels,” the police man muttered, “Ya friggin’ bit me!” But he then fell silent.<br />
<br />
Luckily for Pete, the two men were transfixed by the police man, and Pete suddenly realised what they were staring at. The police man was quaking on the floor, shaking violently as if he were still trying to throw the men off, his face directed at his waist. His brown hair turned a shade lighter, as if being bleached subtly in the darkness, followed by a slight popping sound. The police man thrust his head up, revealing that the top two thirds of his blue shirt had split open, revealing a muscular chest to rival that of the two Speedo Men watching on. <br />
“Oh my…” the police man whispered hoarsely as he began to rub his chest with his hands, fingering the hair across his pecks. An odd smile spread across his face as the hair reverted back into his chest, and looked on as the slight gut he had developed hardened into chiseled abs. He gripped his chest in pain, as if having trouble breathing. Panting slightly, he groped across his crotch until he got a grip on the belt on his pants. He didn’t even have to unbuckle it; the second his fingers touched the metal, it popped apart and shot around to his back. This drew Pete’s attention down to the police man’s penis, which seemed to be protruding against the black pants forcibly, as if trying to break free. The two Speedo Men rushed to his sides, and rather than fight them off, the police man let them stay, to help him through the change. They each took one of his arms and bit softly into his flesh on his wrist, not piercing the skin, but seductively luring him in. His biceps pushed outward, flaring his short sleeved shirt out until the material stuck tightly to his skin. Several large veins were distinctly outlined in the fabric, and as they appeared, the police man’s remaining buttons shot off as the tight abs wedged through.<br />
<br />
The police man began to sweat. He somehow knew that beneath his pants, the last remaining part of the change would be complete should it be revealed. Gathering his little self control, he placed both his hands onto his balls and forced them to remain there, as they slowly began pumping semen into his penis. The Speedo Men looked down at the police man’s penis, pushing tightly against the zipper of his pants. Slowly, they lowered their hands to the waist of them, caressing his stomach gently as they progressed downward.<br />
&quot;No...&quot; the police man moaned, but he made no movement to stop them, his hands sticking to the base of his shaft. <br />
<br />
In one movement, they had both taken clasp of the zipper and pulled it down, freeing his penis, and to both the police man and Pete’s surprise, a red Speedo slid through, containing an enormous erection. The police man thrust his head upward once more, and howled at the full moon as pre cum from his horny penis seeped through. Pete recognized this as the howl being similar to that of the howl he had earlier, and then realized what was happening. The police man smiled as he slid down his pants to his ankles and kicked them off, the only remaining clothing being his short sleeve officer shirt which looked more like a vest, and his red Speedo, which slowly began to absorb the cum he had shot a moment ago.<br />
<br />
The police man howled again as the two Speedo Men lowered themselves into his massive arms and began to massage his lower chest and kiss his neck as he embraced them. Pete watched as the police man lowered his hands down their backs and squeezed their tight asses through the Speedos, causing them to howl softly in pleasure as they each placed a hand onto his penis through the Speedo and began to rub it, making it become even more erect.<br />
<br />
Pete suddenly came to his senses; he slammed the door to his trailer shut. Surely if they got him he would turn into...whatever the hell they were...he decided that he couldn’t do anything now, not this late at night. He’d wait till morning or something...hopefully they will forget he was there and move on, THEN he’d do something about those guys.</p>
