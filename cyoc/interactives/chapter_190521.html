<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max sat his bare ass down in front of the Chronivac. It was his turn to change his friend with this amazing device, one that had left him wriggling around like a snake moments before.<br />
<br />
He looked at Rick and grinned. “Go concern yourself with something else. It’s gonna be a surprise, like you did with me.”<br />
<br />
Rick rolled his eyes and the stepped away nervously. He was excited for his first change, but now that the roles were reversed, he was worried about being under Max’s control.<br />
<br />
Max looked over the parameters that had been set. Five minute transformation time, with time being transformed as one hour: good. He had a lot of fun with the pleasurable setting, so he wasn’t going to deprive Rick that experience. Everything seemed pretty good for this round, but a particular setting caught his eye. “Discomfiture.” It was set to off. Max quickly Googled it and assumed it would somehow manage Rick’s embarrassment or humiliation level while being transformed. <br />
<br />
While he was a Snake, Max had felt quite a bit of power, even though he was a relatively small. There wasn’t anything humiliating about being transformed for him. But Max knew his friend. Rick obviously liked to see other people change, but whenever they’d discussed transformation, Rick admitted being attracted to the power exchange, being helpless while changing. Perhaps a bit of enforced humiliation would be good for him. Max switched it on.<br />
<br />
Now for the form: Max considered many possibilities, but he remembered the smallest and cutest pet he’d ever owned was a Golden Hamster. At less than half a foot long, Rick would be cute as a button and totally under his control. <br />
<br />
Max looked over the changes, and unlike Rick before him, announced he was about to begin. Rick came back into the room and stood before Max naked. <br />
<br />
“Maybe, I should look over your parameters,” Rick said, stepping towards the computer. “I know it can be a bit complicated.”<br />
<br />
Max wouldn’t give Rick the chance. He pressed enter and watched as the timer began to count down.<br />
<br />
“Too late,” Max said, turning to observe his friend. “Better accept your fate. I can’t wait until you figure out what you are.”<br />
<br />
Rick began to feel a bit hot, but instead of sweating, he just started to rub his forehead and chest. He was already starting to get hard, and frankly, that was making him super embarrassed. How could he pop a boner so quickly in front of his straight friend?<br />
<br />
“Dude, I’m so sorry,” Rick said, using his arms to cover his erection. “I swear it must be the Chronivac, I’m not, like…gosh I didn’t mean to make this overly…”<br />
<br />
“Sexual?” Max chuckled. He decided to lean into the feelings Rick was admitting now. “It’s okay dude, I know how it is. Although, I didn’t get hard that fast. You must be quite the little horn dog. You’ve probably been waiting for this for a while. Was that your plan all along? Invite me over so that you could be naked and hard around me? That’s pretty horny of you.”<br />
<br />
Rick began to blush deep red in embarrassment. He’d never felt more humiliated than right now. Was it true? Did he secretly just want to be nude around Max, rock hard boner on display, on the edge of blowing a giant…<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Rick lost all control as a single, powerful stream of cum burst forth from his dick. It lasted at least three seconds. It shot up directly in the air: some hit the ceiling, but a lot fell down in front of Rick. When he shot a second time, Max started to chuckle while he noticed a dusting of fur begin to appear all over Rick’s body. It was golden ginger, much different than the dark hair on the top of Rick’s head.<br />
<br />
The cum flow stopped and Rick looked as if he wanted to run from the room. Max decided to egg him on: “Dude! All that was backed up in there? Fuck. Well, I guess that was your humanity out the drain. Any guesses what you’re turning into?”<br />
<br />
Rick looked down as himself. He noticed his dick was beginning to shrink, hair was getting thicker all over his body. He noticed his hands and a feet were taking on a claw-like shape. Despite his continued humiliating feelings, Rick made himself speak. “Um, maybe a cat? A kitten?” He squeaked a bit for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“Not quite,” Max replied. “Let’s give it another minute to see if you can tell. It looks like your cum rocket is reshaping and getting quite a bit smaller. And you’re definitely shrinking along with it.”<br />
<br />
It was true. Rick’s penis was basically a little bean at this point, and seemed to be receding into an inner body sheath of sorts. His ballsack, however, was reshaping to be flatter spread across his crotch from leg to leg. His limbs were becoming better for crouching, his hands and feet basically turning to claws.<br />
<br />
As he shrank closer to the ground, and as his hair changed color to be more ginger and spread across his face, Rick could tell through his pulsing pleasurable humiliation he was becoming a rodent of some kind. <br />
<br />
Rick mustered his last words as his vocal chords changed. “Am I, eek! A rat?”<br />
<br />
Max shook his head. “Close enough. You’re gonna be my little hamster pet, Ricky.”<br />
<br />
The knowledge of this prompted a renewed wave of humiliation. He could feel now as his face changed to become Max’s helpless pet. He could feel his skull reform, pointing outwards as his nose became pinker, his front teeth became closer to buck teeth, whiskers sprouted out, his ears grew large and relocated to the top of his head, and his eyes became beady and black. He was humiliated by being a pet, but somehow he knew, that was the part he liked.<br />
<br />
His body grew smaller, but proportionally, his torso and hindquarters took up most of his mass. His neck was hidden with fur but almost seemed to be part of his larger mass, a face on a body with four tiny limbs.<br />
<br />
As he settled into the end of the five minutes, Rick was scared, embarrassed, but also excited to be changed. He was now only six inches long. He started to instinctually sniff the air. <br />
<br />
Max peered down at his little friend. Rick’s little pink claws held up his cute body. He started to take his first steps as a hamster. He sniffed the ground as he went, eventually finding his puddles of cum and then scampering away.<br />
<br />
“Ha! That’s right! You’re no longer a big man, just my little hamster pet,” Max said, picking him up. <br />
<br />
Rick began to squeak as he was raised in the air. Max turned Rick over. He was experienced with handling hamsters. Once, his pets had became pregnant, and he learned to identify the sex of the adolescent rodents. He knew it would cause Rick some grief to have the same treatment now.<br />
<br />
“Oh yep, you are still male,” Max said as he held Rick upside down. Rick squeaked frantically as he explained. “It can be difficult to tell, but the giveaway is the little testes that wiggle between the… or, your legs.” He gently flicked Rick’s nuts for emphasis.<br />
<br />
Rick would have never expected that being transformed into anything would be this humiliating. Not only was he firmly in the grab of Max’s palm, he was also being examined like a literal guinea pig. He tried his best to wiggle with displeasure, signaling his hope to be put down.<br />
<br />
“Little restless there, bud,” Max said. “I gotta make sure my pet is healthy.” He flipped Rick back over and set him on the counter. Rick started to peer around. The world was so much larger, especially Max, his owner for the next hour. He watched as Max walked over the absolutely giant fridge and opened it.<br />
<br />
“I would always feed my hamsters pellets,” Max started. “Since you don’t have those, I might as well treat you to some…lettuce! That will work.” Max peeled off a large leaf and set it on the counter in front of Rick. Rick scurried over. It was a bit cold for his new sensibilities, but he started to munch on it. He let his instincts take over, chowing down on the leaf, stuffing his tiny body with sustenance.<br />
<br />
“It’s so fun to watch you eat that lettuce,” Max remarked. “It’s just the perfect meal for a pet like you.”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this sentence, Rick felt embarrassment once again. He felt so small and helpless in this form. And he hated to admit it, but it made him aroused a bit. All this he considered as he pigged out on a single leaf of lettuce.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, what should we do,” Max pondered. “I could take you out into the garden, but I think you deserve to be seen.” He wandered over to his clothes and began to pull them on. “I think I should take you on a short trip around the neighborhood. We can take a walk on the greenbelt, and you can ride on my shoulder like the little pet you are.”<br />
<br />
Rick looked up at Max. He was going to take him out of the safety of his house? What if something happened? Everyone was going to see him! It was too much! He started to dash behind some stuff on the counter.<br />
<br />
“Uh-oh,” Max said. “It look like someone is nervous to be seen as my little pet.” He easily pushed aside Rick’s hiding place and picked the hamster up. He placed Rick on his shoulder. <br />
<br />
Rick grabbed on for dear life. This was happening. He was going to be a little rodent on display for the whole neighborhood whether he wanted to or not.<br />
<br />
Max pulled out his camera. He took a selfie of the two of them. Then he pointed the camera at Rick alone. “Come on bud, I know you can be cuter than that.”<br />
<br />
Rick tried to oblige, but all he could do for most of the shots was hide his face with his claws.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Little shy. It’s okay. Going out and about might break you out of your shell.”<br />
<br />
Max slipped his shoes on walked out the door. Rick looked every way he could. The world was a hundred times bigger than he remembered. The trees were skyscrapers, the bushes were houses, the houses were mountains, and Max’s shoulder was the safest place to be.<br />
<br />
Eventually they started to pass by some neighbors he knew. Max nodded to them. Rick could see them react with glee, saying “look, it’s so cute.” They would have never guessed the “it” in question was a grown man who lived next door just a fifteen minutes before. <br />
<br />
Max was having a lot of fun with his friend turned pet. Everyone they passed by made a comment, or at least noticed. He couldn’t wait to hear how Rick was feeling when he turned back. He could tell the humiliation setting was taking effect, and they were both having fun in their own way with that factor in play.<br />
<br />
Eventually they found a bench along a path. Max sat down and rested as he pet Rick on the head. A couple of men approached and noticed the hamster on Max’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Aw, heck man! Look at that,” the first man said to his friend. “That dude’s got a little dude.” The two friends approached, Max smiling at their comments. <br />
<br />
“Yep, just got him,” Max replied. “Super fun to carry around. Loves getting pet. You wanna try?”<br />
<br />
“Why not?” The other guy said. He slowly reached out his hand towards the hamster.<br />
<br />
Rick couldn’t believe he was getting attention from these strangers. He was initially scared, but didn’t want to disobey Max. He just grasped onto Max’s shoulder while the two guys took turns petting his furry head. It was harmless fun, but even so, Rick felt the now familiar humiliation that came along with being so little, doted upon, reminded of his status as a tiny pet.<br />
<br />
The two men moved on and Max stood up to keep walking. After a while of walking, Rick started to wonder how long it had been. Was Max keeping track of the time? His nervousness started to become apparent as he involuntarily squeaked.<br />
<br />
“What’s up, pet?” Max gave Rick a little scritch. “We can turn around soon. We still have…” Max looked down at his watch. “Oh shit.”<br />
<br />
Max had not been watching the time. They were at least fifteen minutes from home and Rick’s time would be up in less that three.<br />
<br />
“We gotta get back.” Max grabbed Rick off his shoulder as Rick began to squeak in earnest. He put his hamster friend in his shirt pocket and started to dash home. Rick could tell they were in trouble. What was he going to do if he started to turn back while in his friends’ pocket?</p>
