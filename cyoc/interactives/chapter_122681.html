<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The dagger can do some miraculous things. I don't know what to use here. Use these suggestions maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Also don't worry about the face mask and iron pants he has now. They are still penetrable just have to be creative about it. The armor is also thin enough that it served as clothing only.<br/>
<br/>
Dagger Abilities.<br/>
<br/>
-Stab a corrupted being and absorb its corruption returning it to its uncorrupted form and then kills if left unhealed, like a normal dagger.<br/>
<br/>
-Stab a corrupted creature and assimilate it.<br/>
<br/>
-Stab a corrupted creature and cause it to be frozen in time..<br/>
<br/>
These are simply suggestions. Surprise me with your own.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac leapt to the chest in a hurry and went forwards to open it. In his haste however he didn&#39;t notice the runes inscribed directly on the floor around the chest, hidden within water and faded from time.<br />
<br />
It activated upon the reach of an intruder and reacted...<br />
<br />
Violently. <br />
<br />
All Isaac could do was curse as the wards under him activated as streams of runes rose from the floor binding him like ropes. They snaked on his ice skin and pulled him down. Forced to kneel Isaac hurriedly chanted a magic he learned at the training house; the spell of dissonance. <br />
<br />
&#39;Disputatio!&#39; <br />
<br />
And was rewarded as the runes suddenly became unstable, each rune contradicting each other. Not long after the runes died out, falling to the floor as magic dust.<br />
<br />
Raggedly panting Isaac tried to read the sigil formation on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bind the one tresspassing my ground and they shall be bound&quot; Isaac muttered the rune letters. Teeth gnashing at his recklessness due to his arousal filled head Isaac took a swipe at the sigil formation permanently disabling them. He didn&#39;t account that his body was different now; he left a gash on the floor.<br />
<br />
Standing up Isaac walked to the chest. Making sure that no surprises await him Isaac slipped his vine fingers under the lid and threw it open, quickly shielding his face with his arms.<br />
<br />
As nothing occured in the last five seconds Isaac took a look at the contents. Inside was a small metal cube, a book and a dagger.<br />
<br />
Well to be specific the box was as dark as ebony with a single red gem embedded in it. The box held no engravings or anything, it was a simple cube.<br />
<br />
The book however was more... <br />
<br />
Unnatural. <br />
<br />
It was floating. Its cover made of leather and a sigil was engraved into it and it glowed. The book glowed with mystical energy.<br />
<br />
The dagger however looked normal...<br />
<br />
Suspiciously normal and odd to have this item with the two more mysterious items. Probably a hidden function?<br />
<br />
Taking the dagger first and testing its balance as Isaac flipped it in many ways, he nodded in its perfect balance. Placing it beside him Isaac took the book next. The moment he touched it however a bright flash of light nearly blinded him. Thankfully with his corrupt body all it did was create multiple rainbows all over the room as they refracted. The book in his grasp didn&#39;t float anymore. Isaac opened its pages to, discover each of them simply...<br />
<br />
Empty.<br />
<br />
Pulling his claws over his face in frustration Isaac took a breather, as much as he needed as it brought the sense of familiarity and comfort for doing a much more human behaviour.<br />
<br />
His exhale froze the water it touched.<br />
<br />
Eyeing the box Isaac disregarded its demonic form and grabbed it. Bringing it closer to his face to inspect it he eyed the red gem. His glowing eyes made the gem purple. <br />
<br />
Suddenly the box leapt out of his grasp and impacted with his face.<br />
<br />
Jerking back Isaac tried to claw at his face. What he met was a plate of metal scraping against his claws. Isaac felt it as the metal spread all over his form as it covered most of his body. Still struggling on the floor in a fit of panic Isaac rolled on the ground. He didn&#39;t notice that the Lexicon had opened and wrote itself.<br />
<br />
The ring, detecting a powerful corrupt entity shined brighter, illuminating the entire room. The metal formed itself over Isaac as a full body armor took shape. <br />
<br />
Isaac was clawing at the armor, his vision tinged red from the lenses of this mask or his anger. A voice suddenly rang in his head.<br />
<br />
&#39;Give in&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Your body&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;IS MINE&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gaaagh!&quot; Isaac gagged as the metal constricted him. The ring, as if alive, suddenly dissapeared on his fingers. Isaac felt how the corruption from every monster he met plague his thoughts; the bramble vines, the ice elemental, the incubus, succubus, witch and ghoul rang in his head as Isaac roared in mental pain. Their voices threatened his inner voice, trying to claim dominance. With a sudden gasp Isaac felt relieved when the voices suddenly dissapeared. A certain tightness was felt on his neck. Feeling for it Isaac couldn&#39;t help but notice the choker. The voice from this armor was silenced as well. <br />
<br />
Standing up and checking himself Isaac was suprised by how tight the armor formed itself. It was thin and simply covered his body like a second skin. Protrusions like his spikes were covered in metal and newer plates of ebony metal framed his form. A breastplate, some grieves, gloves and even a neck guard. The fullbody armor didn&#39;t fully cover him as most parts were free. It didn&#39;t have enough materials to fully cover him and it was thinned to paper thin. Quickly jogging to a wall disregarding the fact that his body was creating loud metal stomps on the ground. The armor was heavy and he was already heavy.<br />
<br />
Inhale...<br />
<br />
Exhale...<br />
<br />
Looking at the mirror Isaac noticed how the armor covered him. His glowing circles for irises glowed beneath red lenses, that made it glow purple. His face was covered by a flat plate that was featureless. Opening his mouth Isaac gasped as sharp maws of teeth appeared as the armor parted where his maw was, another layer of razor sharp jagged mimic of teeth overlaying his ice thorn ones.<br />
<br />
Closing his mouth made the armor melt into place sealing the hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could work in my favor.&quot; Isaac said to himself. The armor was thinned to the point that it was better labelled as clothing instead. Quite sure it wouldn&#39;t stop a sharp bite but a sex organ from penetrating any of his holes on his body would be fine. The ring was gone from his fingers by how he could feel it. Instead it had transformed into a choker on his neck, tight but loose under the thick sheet of ice behaving as his epidermal layers.<br />
<br />
Turning to the book and dagger Isaac picked them up and and read the text. By how it had started writing only when the possessed compacted armor started overtaking him Isaac rationalized that this book is bound to him now along with the armor and anything that touches his body for prolonged time would be recorded by how detailed the Lexicon had written an entry about the Possessed Armor.<br />
<br />
Sighing out of his face mask Isaac took the dagger and pocketed it in his side. <br />
<br />
Waking to the bookshelves Isaac took a pile of books into his arms. Hauling books stacked higher than his entire body was too easy. His strength magnified. Discarding the books that held no use Isaac found several books worth keeping. Books about researched corruptions, healing, purification and spells. <br />
<br />
Contemplating on how to bring it safely Isaac was interrupted as his armor suddenly shifted. <br />
<br />
The next moment the books were gone. He felt something travelling in his body of vines. Realizing that he had stored the books within himself Isaac grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Convenient.&quot;<br />
<br />
One last look at his armored body and a check over both of his armored arms and sharp tipped claws Isaac headed for the warded door.</p>
