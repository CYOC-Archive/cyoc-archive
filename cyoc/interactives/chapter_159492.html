<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria decided to leave her room and the spider in it who wanted to eat her.  She wondered whether Sam would turn back into a human while he was still in her room, or if he would scurry off elsewhere.  If he did become human again in her room, would he go through her stuff?  She decided she didn’t mind.  All her valuables were in the safe, and this entire resort was about transformation.  It wasn’t the time to get so upset about the possessions she obtained as a human.  She should focus on being a fly. <br />
<br />
So she did.  She flew into the same vent Sam had used to enter her room, and took a left at the first turn.  She had been a little disappointed earlier that she had to choose between making a transformation and attending the cocktail party held every afternoon out on the patio.  Gloria’s room was right next to the patio and she was looking forward to attending, but her curiosity to transform had won out.  Now she could do both.<br />
<br />
Although the vent was dark, Gloria had no problem flying towards the bright light down the tunnel that indicated the vent leading outside.  She was getting better at flying, and she easily navigated her way through the vent and went outside.<br />
<br />
What she saw was exactly what she was looking for, and it was breathtaking.  There were all sorts of giants out on the patio, men and women in cocktail attire, relaxed and having conversations in the warm afternoon breeze as they sipped their cocktails. <br />
<br />
Gloria flew at a low height, roughly three feet off the ground, to make sure she had a good view of all the giants towering over her.  She was a little concerned that the giants would all recoil in horror as she flew past, but she discovered, to her surprise and arousal, that she meant so little to these giants that they didn’t notice or care if she was around.<br />
<br />
Flying around was great, but after a few minutes of it, Gloria had had her fill of it and wanted to try something spicier.  First, she decided to go for contact.  She didn’t want to get swatted so soon after starting, so she decided to land on the clothing a giant was wearing.<br />
<br />
She chose a professional-looking blonde giantess who appeared to be in her late 40s.  The woman was wearing a gold-colored sleeveless dress that covered her back and shoulders.  In addition to giving Gloria plenty of landing area, the woman was in conversation with a circle of people at the edge of the party.  If Gloria landed on her back, no one would even see her, so long as she avoided getting the giant woman’s attention.<br />
<br />
Gloria wanted to come in subtly to avoid detection.  She decided to stay relatively low because anyone looking at the woman would be able to see Gloria drop on in as she descended.  She did make sure to make a wide loop around, flying far out of the range of the party, out over the lawn of the resort, before turning back in.  She found zigzagging through the air like normal flies was easy to do given the subtle wind currents that normal people don’t see, making her flying look more natural.  She swooped on in, roughly at thigh height, and then flew up right behind the woman, admiring her dress as she flew higher and higher.  She picked the top of the giant woman’s left shoulder blade as her target for landing, and came in slowly.  Fortunately, the woman was mostly standing in place, making the landing easier.  The other giants in conversation with her would have said she wasn’t moving, but at Gloria’s size she could detect movement that was real but manageable.<br />
<br />
She had done it. Gloria was now physically touching a giant person, or at least the giant’s clothing.  It was so exciting for her and absolutely as much fun as she had hoped.  She flew to another part of the back of her dress, and then boldly flew up to her neck and, despite needing skill and precision, landed on one of the pearls in the giant woman’s necklace.  She stared up at the woman’s neck and giant blonde hair.  It was an incredible feeling being so close to someone so large without them even detecting you.  She loved it.  Gloria briefly considered seeing if she could land on top of the giant’s blonde hair without her or her companions noticing, but Gloria decided to go bolder.<br />
<br />
Gloria launched herself off the giant pearl and back into the air.  She flew down past the woman’s back and past her ass, still looking pretty good for a woman her age, until she reached the bottom of the woman’s dress, just above her knees.  Gloria then turned horizontally and flew under the woman’s dress.<br />
<br />
Gloria knew that doing this would test all her skills as a fly.  She did her best to hover in place as she looked upwards.  Although it was unsurprisingly darker up the giant’s skirt than outside, there was enough light reflecting up from the ground for Gloria to see the woman’s cream-colored panties.  Gloria marveled again at how amazing it was to be so intimate with such a giant person who was completely unaware of her presence or even existence.<br />
<br />
It was time for Gloria to land, partly to rest but partly to fulfill her mission to get the full experience of a fly.  She flew upwards, being meticulous not to let either of the giant’s thighs brush against her wings, eventually picking out a spot on the woman’s inner thigh, a couple of giant-scale inches below the woman’s panties.  Gloria flew in as slowly as possible.  She knew her six fly legs were individually too small for a human to easily detect, so she tried to make sure to set each leg down as softly as possible, without moving them around, and in succession as opposed to all at once.<br />
<br />
She took a moment to wait, and soon realized that the giant still didn’t know of her existence.  She was elated.  Here she was, a fly hanging on the side of a giant woman’s inner thigh.  They were so personally connected.  Gloria knew the time was right.<br />
<br />
Knowing she would have to strike quickly, Gloria thrust her mouthparts into the giant woman’s flesh.  Gloria felt passionate and excited as the woman’s blood flooded inside her mouth.  She let her fly instinct take over as she gorged herself.<br />
<br />
The reaction from the giant was immediate and, from Gloria’s perspective, significant, as the woman lurched to her left, evidently thinking that would dislodge the fly.  She was mistaken, as Gloria held on and finished indulging her bloodlust.  She pulled her mouthparts out of the giant woman in triumph and reveled in the feeling of the giant’s hot blood inside her.  Now she was a real fly.</p>
