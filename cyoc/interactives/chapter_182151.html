<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As its tip left the earth Alex felt a tingle rush though his arm. Immediately, he knew this was no ordinary sword. His clothes were the first to change as a sparking energy rapidly  spread across their fabric dissolving them into thin air with a fizzle. In moments, he stood atop the hill naked. &quot;What th-&quot; he sputtered as the tingle moved south to his legs. Quickly, his sparse leg hair began to thicken and change consistency. Alex shivered as he felt thousands of hairs push out from him turning a light dusting of hair into a full blown jet-black coat. Once his legs were obscured under the growth, it spread upwards, covering his butt and upper thighs and stopping just shy of his abs, framing them below with an aesthetic v-shape.<br />
<br />
Filled with a mixture of fright and intrigue, Alex brushed his hands through the fur, fascinated at otherworldly sensation. The hair was silky and the mere brush of his finger tips on each strand send tingles of please up his spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always did enjoy when the stallion&#39;s would rub my fur&quot; He thought as he continued. <br />
<br />
A beat passed, and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck?&quot; he said allowed clasping his hands against his head &quot;Did-Did I just think that? stallions? What the fuck does that even mean?&quot; <br />
<br />
He hardly had even a second to collect his thoughts before an odd swelling sensation over took both his lower abs, just above his crotch, and his tail bone. Slowly two new appendages emerged from his waist. Inch by inch they pushed forward and slowly took recognizable form. At their tip, stood what looked to be a hefty black hoof crowned by a shaggy mop of white hairs which quickly tapered into shorter midnight fur matching to what now covered his legs. Behind him a burst of long shaggy hair fell from his tailbone and gradually moved downwards, supported by a growth of flesh that soon lengthened into what appeared to be a horse&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Turning around, he eyed the tail. Oddly, something in his brain seemed to recognize it. While he knew he shouldn&#39;t have a horse&#39;s tail, its presence on his butt just seemed...right. Like it had always been there. Experimentally, he gave it a flick. &quot;I didn&#39;t even have to think about it&quot; he noted &quot;Its as if I always had one...&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two legs pushing from his waist met the ground, he felt the otherworldly sensation of his lower spine being to lengthen. His butt pushed backwards horizontally as he felt new mas form between his two sets of legs. As each new inch of spine was added, his back legs - his &#39;human&#39; legs were forced to take a step back to accommodate this &#39;second torso&#39; he was quickly building. Each step sent a ripple up his &#39;hindlegs&#39; pumping powerful muscle into his upper thighs which ballooned in equine power. His butt joined them, reshaping into a horses&#39; hindquarters and giving his burgeoning legs the proper support needed to continue their change.  Below, his knees painlessly creaked backwards, accommodating a new stance befitting his increasingly horse-like second torso.  <br />
<br />
The torso itself had by now extended several feet and had begun to back on pounds of muscle. His &#39;lower torso&#39; ballooned downwards, taking on the deep gentle slope of the underside of a horse. His two front legs had blown well pas his hind legs in muscle mass, having formed with the full power needed to support the bulk of both a horse and a human torso. Their &#39;shoulders&#39; if you can call them that, rippled with strength, supporting the roughly 5 feet of horse-leg below. <br />
<br />
Soon, the changes abated. Turning his now human torso, Alex looked back at the massive horse body he now controlled. &quot;We clydesdale&#39;s sure are outmatched in the size department&quot; He mused shortly before catching himself once again thinking unbidden horse-like thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;God...what&#39;s happening to me....I&#39;m a centaur and I&#39;m even starting to THINK like a centaur.&quot; he muttered with concern. His eyes traced his massive form. &quot;It is true though...I&#39;m just so big now....&quot; He thought as he slowly crossed a hand over his hide. &quot;I&#39;m a centaur now. Something fit for this world...&quot; His concern began to fad as he continued to study his new body.  Beneath his fingers he felt raw power. Little fat covered the powerful muscle that strained beneath his skin, just *waiting* to be used.  He couldn&#39;t help but enjoy just how *good* this body felt. Idly, he picked up each leg, enjoying the flex of their muscles and the way his new form effortlessly manipulated their considerable weight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anethoes above! I must weigh THOUSANDS of drachms. All that meat I&#39;ve been eating has really paid off.&quot; He grinned hardly noticing the shift in his thoughts. His ears, having grown long, black and equine, flicked in pleasure. &quot;Now I&#39;ve just got to get this human torso in line. If I&#39;m gonna take a satllion&#39;s cock I&#39;ve gotta PROVE I&#39;m no weakling.&quot;<br />
<br />
As thoughts of stallions entered his mind, he felt his still unchanged cock slowly start to harden behind him as his body began to release its first cyldesdale hormones. Still gripping the sword, he planted it in the ground as his thoughts continued to be assulted with thick, girthy stallion cocks and new equine hormones washed over his still very human brain. <br />
<br />
&quot;MMMMmmmm&quot; he moaned as he closed his eyes. Lifting his hands he brushed them through his hair which had been busy lengthening while he&#39;d taken in his changes. By now his once short cropped brown hair matched the glossy  jet black of his coat and reached down to his shoulders.<br />
<br />
As the thoughts continued, his cock bobbed needfully behind him. The hormones assulting his mind were driving a powerful lust and served as a prelude to a new wave of change.</p>
