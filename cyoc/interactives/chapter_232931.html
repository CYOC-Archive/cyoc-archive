<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing at the doorway was a girl my age who looks like a young version of my teacher, Victoria Mallard. The hair color and head shape was right. However, her eye colored and nose was different; there is only one person she could’ve gotten those features from. Soon my memories of my new life caught up with me and I remembered her.<br />
<br />
“Morning, Jasmine.” I said as I rubbed my eyes. In this reality, thanks to my wish involving Victoria Mallard she got pregnant around the same time as my mom got pregnant with me. The wedding between the three of them went off without a hitch, and as an added bonus either by God intervention or planning, we were both born on the same day. Affectionately nickname, the twins despite the fact we have different mothers.<br />
<br />
“Morning sleepyhead.” Jasmine teased. “ You must’ve used that thing a lot if you were this sleepy.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘What?’</i> I thought, but then I noticed on Jasmine‘s right hand was a ring identical to mine. Crap. Me and her got our rings at the same time and we separate immediately after that. So while I went on my little adventure she was absent from the rest of the day. So odds are she was probably immune to any reality changes I made. Well time to see how much she does remember or is aware.<br />
<br />
“So… what do you remember?” I ask her. Jasmine straighten up a bed.<br />
<br />
“OK first of all you and Monica were heading to Brad’s?…Bailey’s?… birthday party. That confuses me; why am I remembering two people? Second, why do I remember a hottie freshman now it’s replaced by a handsome hunk of a freshman? Third; Glad that any memory I had of that douche bag. Casey is gone along with that slut, Ashley.  Fourth; remember Jessie Tyler, all of a sudden my memories of her had faded. Fifth; why am I barely remembering those two bitch girlfriends of Brad’s; Jessica and Amber. And finally, why do I remember that competing Chell as a Chinese girl?” Jasmine asked. OK so the wish that involved making Monique into Monica is part of her default timeline.<br />
<br />
“So as the party got started I decided that; with the help of the ring, I put on a magic show with Monica as my assistant.” I started Jasmine looked on with interest. “The first act evolving gender flipping two people into their opposite sex. These two were homos so gender flipping them made them heteros. That hottie freshman that flirted with you even though you weren’t interested is now a hunky guy name Daniel.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my.” Called out Jasmine in a blush I guess she had given in to more of Daniel’s advances than Daniella’s advances.<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately before I began the next trick Mrs. Brockman interrupted us, informing us that she couldn’t find her maid and Monica‘s cousin Nadia. I also noticed that Brad was missing from the audience so I decided to make the next track of them appear in separate boxes.” I continue before pausing. “It was surprisingly a good call cause it was bad, Jasmine.”<br />
<br />
“How bad?” Jasmine asked.<br />
<br />
“Brad tried to rape Nadia and impregnate her.” <br />
<br />
“That’s son of a bitch I can kill him…” Jasmine started to go off<br />
<br />
“Don’t bother cause my next trick punish him severely.” I interrupted her.<br />
<br />
“What did you do?”<br />
<br />
“I enchanted a paddle so that every time he was smacked in the butt by it he would get one year younger. Mrs. Brockman did it so many times that Brad was practically two weeks old by the time she was finished with him. There, of course, had a bit of a negative effect on her because apparently she has a condition that made her weak after she given birth to a child that lasts for a month. However, turns out Mrs. Brockman didn’t need Brad anymore due to the fact that she has a grandson so with the ring, I wish that he was dropped off to an orphanage. As for Mrs. Brockman state, that was an easy fix temporary with the ring and a wish but both of those wishes presented a problem.” I answered.<br />
<br />
“With Brad gone, you couldn’t exactly finish altering reality without coming up a reason to why everyone was at the party.” Jasmine deuce.<br />
<br />
“So thankfully, I had one of the audience volunteered to become a replacement. Jessie Tyler, our friend she has become Bailey Brockman.” <br />
<br />
“OK that explains a lot.”<br />
<br />
“For some of the act Mrs. Brockman became my assistant while Monica comfort her cousin.  And the first trick we did together was turning Casey and Ashley into an immortalized kissing statue. They are at one of the popular Makeout points now.”<br />
<br />
“Good; I can never forgive that cheating douche bag for making out with that slut.” Jasmine declared. Right, she was going out with Casey at the time.<br />
<br />
“Then because I allowed it to happen the effects of my wish to keep Mrs. Brockman up and about started to fade.” I started to say.<br />
<br />
“Why? The effects of our wishes are long lasting why put a limit?” Ask Jasmine interrupting me. <br />
<br />
“And what be mistaken for gods? No better for them to believes that there is a limits to our magic.” I answered the continuing. “Since Nadia was still traumatized and lack of authority figure amongst the staff; I decided to take one of men from the audience and aged them into the head butler.”<br />
<br />
“Who did you use?” <br />
<br />
“Sebastian.”<br />
<br />
“Really? Good for him now he probably is away from his controlling mother.” Comment Jasmine.<br />
<br />
“Anyways continue waiting on the last act I put on; I race changed Chell into a Chinese girl.” I said recounting the events of the show but noticed as that Jasmine was giving me a disappointed look. “What?”<br />
<br />
“You do realize that Chell was one of the dozen girls trying to compete with Ashley, right” Jasmine asked. I shook my head and Jasmine just face palmed. “Well she was run up and now you’ve given her an exotic advantage over the others.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that.” I apologize before Jasmine collected herself.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about too much that’s something we have to deal with down the road. So what happened?” Jasmine asked. I then proceed recount the rest of the party as well as me and Monica trying to leave to be stopped by both Jessica and Amber. When I told what I did to them, Jasmine started to laugh heavily. “So you cursed them to grow younger until they were helpless babies by staring, at Mrs. Brockman‘s breast?”<br />
<br />
“Yep and judging by the fact, we both recall Jessica and Amber our age, but also can’t remember them truly at all means that she was successful. Those two are her foster daughters now.” I said before I gave Jasmine inquisitive look. “So what have you been doing with your ring since you got it?”<br />
<br />
Jasmine gave me a smile.</p>
