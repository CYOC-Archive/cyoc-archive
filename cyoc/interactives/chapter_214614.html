<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was back in the field, though now it was morning. And as if that wasn&#39;t confusing enough, she was now completely naked as well. Jen realized that she was kneeling as well, with her balls actually suspending her legs up off of the ground. If she extended her legs, she could feel the cool, damp grass and dirt, with just enough space for her to lift her testicles up off the ground. <br />
<br />
Taking a few moments to take in her surroundings, Jen stood up, and began slowly walking towards the barn that she could see off in the distance. Strange enough, despite being naked, Jen felt very comfortable and wasn&#39;t even cold at all. Her balls seemed to radiate a warmer body temperature than what should be normally  humanly possible, and were acting as her own built in heat source. She reasoned that each one of them must have a horse&#39;s normal body temperature instead of her own. <br />
<br />
She felt a slight breeze which perked her nipples and caused her balls to tingle a bit. It felt kinda nice in a pleasurable kind of way, but that was now dangerous, as too much stimulus would bring out her half a dozen erections. When she got close to the barn, she felt something weird begin to twitch on top of her head an she could suddenly hear the muffled sounds of voices from much further away than what she reasoned should be possible. <br />
<br />
She stepped onto the gravel driveway and didn&#39;t even consider how it didn&#39;t even hurt her feet to do so. 3.5 tons of weight on two human feet standing on pointy gravel and she had no issues with it. She wasn&#39;t even walling flat-footed, but standing exclusively on her toes as well, almost as if she were wearing an invisible pair of high heels. If she was in a better state of mind, this would have rung alarm bells in her head. <br />
<br />
Jen approached the door, but came to a stop as she discovered that she couldn&#39;t reach the embedded pull handle due to her balls being in the way. Unlike a normal door know that protruded, this one was just a channel that had been carved out of the door&#39;s face. It was about 20 seconds later that the barn door slid to the side and 2 familiar people walked towards her, while a third released the door. <br />
<br />
Her parents and uncle approached her casually as if she wasn&#39;t sporting 6 horse sized horse cocks and a dozen testicles. Jen took a step forwards onto the concrete floor of the barn and herd a metallic clack. Jen paused and looked around in an attempt to find the source of the sound. Then took another step, sounding out another metallic clack the moment her foot contacted the floor. She stopped immediately and tried digging through her ball flesh in order to look at her feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here sweetie, use this instead&quot; calmly said Jen&#39;s Mom as she set down a tall mirror for her daughter. Jen turned around, making a few more clicks in the process and approached the mirror. Her jaw dropped upon seeing her reflection. <br />
<br />
Her balls and cocks aside, she looked normal enough, save for a pair of protrusions poking out from the top of her head. She knew immediately what they were though. They clearly were horse ears, a desk pulling her hair aside, she finally realized that her human ears were now nowhere to be found. <br />
<br />
Additionally, she looked down below her nuts and found that she was standing on her toes, which wasn&#39;t the least worrying thing she saw. Beneath her toes on both feet, or rather, secured to the bottoms of her toes, was a pair of metal horse shoe. She went stiff as the thought of them being nailed to her feet entered her mind, but somehow that didn&#39;t seem to be the case here. <br />
<br />
She only now thought about how it was both easy and painless to walk over sharp stones and rough dirt while barefoot. She lifted one of them and looked at it. She found it to be oddly kind of beautiful for some unknown reason. The pair of miniature horse shoes looked weirdly appropriate to be fixed to her toes. She gave the floor a few taps, proving how solid of an attachment the shoes had to her, then set her foot down again. <br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s uncle approached her from the side and in one fluid motion, slung a sack around her head with the opening pointed towards her mouth. &quot;Eat up Jen, we got a big day ahead of us&quot; he said and Jen felt her tongue extend out from her mouth and scoop up some of the oats that were within the bag. Despite being oats, she found them to taste pretty good and continued licking them up while she followed her family around the barn. <br />
<br />
Her half skirt of horse nuts swayed around her as she slowly walked around. And she was being extra careful to not over stimulate herself for the time being. But that was short lived.<br />
<br />
Her Dad began to pull sacks down from the walls and handed them off to her Mom and Uncle, who then began setting them down on her sheaths as if they were hooks. Her Mom handed Jen a weird vest that had a pair of holes for her boobs to fit through, and a pair of straps behind the back that she wasn&#39;t yet sure about their purpose. <br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t need to be told that she was to put it on, and just did so, fastening the belts snugly and tying down the straps. But then her Mom took the back straps and secured her arms behind her back in a reverse prayer binding. Jen tried to free her arms, but it was no use. The binding held strong and she couldn&#39;t even get a bit more wiggle room out of it. <br />
<br />
Her oat bag was removed from her face, and she had apparently emptied it completely without even realizing it. Her Mom then showed her another harness which she groaned upon seeing what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try putting it on Jen, we adjusted it from last time, so it should fit your head a lot better now&quot; reassured her Dad as he hopped down from the wall. Jen rolled her eyes and let her Dad place the wooden bit into her mouth before he secured the rest of the harness around her head. <br />
<br />
She then felt her Mom pull her ponytail out from the back and adjusted the straps to fit her head a little bit better. It was comfortable, but annoying since she couldn&#39;t close her mouth and her field of view was significantly reduced thanks to the blinders. Her Mom then tossed the long reins over her head and turned Jen around by pulling on them. Jen was lead out of the back of the barn and stopped in front of a large wagon. It was a traveling wagon only without the bonnet, and Jen was finding her parents attaching the wagon to the metal rings hanging off to either side of her chest. <br />
<br />
She felt the weight tug down on her, but could still easily carry it despite it being so heavy. The bags were removed from her sheaths and loaded into the wagon, along with her family, with her Mom taking her reins. Drool began dripping from her mouth as Je  looked behind her in a failed attempt to see her parents. The blinders were too effective. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Jen, let&#39;s head out. We have to bring the supplies to the next ranch over&quot; said her Uncle as if it were a perfectly normal thing to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm????&quot; Questioned Jen. Did they really expect her to haul the wagon for 10 miles? She could barely walk, let alone run. It would take her all day to get there. But Jen&#39;s body took over and somehow began gracefully trotting at a relatively quick pace forwards. Jen was surprised with how effortlessly she was doing this, despite not having any control over her legs. Even the wagon felt weightless behind her. <br />
<br />
As the sound of horseshoe on asphalt filled the air, Jen began to start feeling good. The more she trotted, the more refreshed she became. It felt natural to be moving around. She never considered it until now, but Jen realized that she likely had the strength of all of her horses. She literally had 6 horsepower plus one human young woman&#39;s, which wasn&#39;t much in comparison to her equine counterparts.<br />
<br />
Jen closed her eyes and left the steering entirely up to her Mom. Just letting herself run forwards without worry was a totally unique experience and brought her a weird sense of freedom despite being almost the exact opposite. She also discovered that despite the extreme movements, her cock and balls felt no stimulation whatsoever. It was as if they were comfortably numb. <br />
<br />
She wondered why they had no reaction to the wind or movements? But then it dawned upon her. Could it be because her arms were physically restrained? She couldn&#39;t possibly free them by herself, meaning that if she got an erection, she couldn&#39;t masturbate like the curse required her to do. Then, since the use of her hands was out of her control, did the curse disable her ability to get an erection? It made sense the more she pondered about it.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s good mood came to a sudden halt though when they arrived at the ranch. She had only been moving for maybe an hour or so. Was she really this fast now? But that thought would have to wait until later. As Jen was steered onto the property, she decided to finally open her eyes, having spent most of the last 40 minutes with them fully closed. To her shock, standing there before her, seemingly awaiting her arrival was...</p>
