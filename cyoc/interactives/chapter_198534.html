<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking into the barn, he sees in the middle of the barn a young girl about his age and an younger boy about eleven or twelve. The girl had the boy pin to the ground with his arms behind his back. <br />
<br />
“That will teach you for running off like that.” The girl says to the smaller boy. “You know dad doesn’t like it when you explore this property. Besides the new owners are moving in soon.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t care.” The boy says. “Do you think it’s weird that everyone seems to disappear from here.” <br />
<br />
Ian slowly steps forward, stepping on a twig. The two siblings look behind them to see Ian standing there. Ian was looking at the girl, her round plush butt silhouetted by the incoming light. “Who’s there?” The girl asks, not able to see Ian. <br />
<br />
“Um, I’m Ian.” Ian says walking closer. “My parents just bought this farmland.” <br />
<br />
“See you horse hide, someone was moving in.” The girl says before giving her brother a loving whack on the head to which he replied with an “Ouch.” <br />
<br />
The girl stands up and wipes off her hands before placing one out for Ian to shake. “I’m Sasha. This little horse butt is my little brother Jacob. We live on the neighboring farm just a few hundred acers that way.” Sasha points to the back side of the barn. “My brother loves to come out this way looking for the people that suppositively disappeared out here. That’s just a load of crap if you ask me. Most new people just get board with the town and leave quickly.” <br />
<br />
“Did something happen to the last ones who own the house?” Ian asks, becoming distracted by Sasha’s button-down shirt. “Oh, I’m Ian.<br />
Sasha smiles as she sees the young Ian looking her over. She wore her top open on purpose to allow her breasts to breath. He new she had a large rack and was willing to show them off whenever she could. It wasn’t like she was easy to get with, but she loves the attention she would get. She was also used to working shirtless on the land. It just made the job easier. Her parents didn’t get onto her to much because there was never anyone around. <br />
<br />
“Who knows?” She replies looking Ian over. She quickly sees the bulge in Ian’s shorts from his new enlarge penis. She also could swear she sees its head just peeking out. <br />
<br />
“The last ones that lived here disappeared about six months ago. Their car, clothes, everything. Only a pair of horses were hear. Or so our dad says.” Jacob replies fixing his shirt and dusting himself off. <br />
<br />
“So, how old are you? are you going to be going to school in town?” Sasha asks. <br />
<br />
“I’m sixteen. I think so if there is a good pool. I’m a swimmer and I just want to get back to it.” Ian replies. “How about you?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sixteen as well, but I’ll be turning seventeen by the time school starts up. We maybe in the same class. They like to pair up kids in the same age groups. Jacob here is twelve and is the only one of two in his class. The other is his girlfriend, Ava.” Sasha teases. <br />
<br />
“She is not my girlfriend.” Jacob pouts. “She just the only other kid in my class.” <br />
<br />
The two walk out to see a dark cloud come over the sky. Sasha looks at Ian, “Do you have a phone on you?” <br />
<br />
“Yes? Why?” Ian asks. “And why is the weather changing so fast.” <br />
<br />
“Summer storm.” Jacob replies. “We better wait it out in the barn.” <br />
<br />
“Right,” Sasha replies as she pulls Ian back in. “You should call your folks to let them know you are safe.” <br />
<br />
Ian does so just as the rain starts pouring down heavy. Waiting inside, Sasha continues to talk to Ian as Jacob looks around the large barn. “So, are you with anyone still from where you came from?” <br />
<br />
“No, my boyfriend cheated on me just before i found out we were leaving.” Ian replies. <br />
<br />
“Oh, so you are gay?” Sasha asks. <br />
<br />
“Bi.” Ian replies. “Is that alright?” <br />
<br />
“Fine with me. Most of the football team here is either gay or bi. Not many girls in our age group.” Sasha replies before seeing Ian’s cock poke out of the bottom of his shorts legs as they sat on a bale of hay. “I see that you are already starting to relax.” She points to his member. <br />
Ian moves his hands to cover it up. He had forgotten about his growth while talking to Sasha. “Sorry. It kind of grew on me lately and I’m not used to it being this long.” <br />
<br />
“Sort of a growth spurt? That fine, mine did that too this past year.” Sasha replies grabbing her breasts. “I be lying if I say I wasn’t waiting to test these globes out with a boy, not like I have had sex let though. No one near by to have a go with.” <br />
<br />
“You haven’t had sex yet? Looking like that, I thought all the guys would have been wanting you.” Ian replies. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’ve had offers, but most of these guys are just meat heads. Can’t see past the next school meet or whatever else the town has going on.” Sasha replies. “Wait you have had sex?” <br />
<br />
“Well, with my ex, but not with a girl yet. Just some kissing and a hand job.” Sasha could tell Ian was a little embarrassed by his answer. <br />
Then a crazy idea came into her head. “Hey, I will show you mine if you show me yours. No strings and if we have sex, then we have sex.” <br />
<br />
“Wait what?” Ian replies. <br />
<br />
“Just take your clothes off. It will be fine.” Sasha replies. <br />
<br />
“What about your brother?” Ian asks. <br />
<br />
“Oh, he will be fine. He properly wont bother us unless he sees the storm getting worse or ends. Besides, it’s not like he hasn’t seen people naked. I’m usually topless on our farm anyways and he seen other guys at school. Only one locker room for boys and one for girls, all grades. Told you it was a small town.” Sasha says before unbuttoning her shirt. “I’m taking mine off either way.” <br />
<br />
As Sasha makes her way to her pants, Ian was also taking his clothes off. They folded their clothes on the side of the hay before they looked at each other. Ian was in awe of the beauty that was in front of him. Sasha was clean shaven all over; her hair came down to her nipples and her shape was picturesque of the farm girl next door. Ian could see her freckles on her face during the lightning flashes and her amber hair almost glowed. Her breasts were large and round, making her look older then she was. Sasha takes Ian by the hand and places it on her left nipple. His palm was just slightly larger than the nipple. <br />
<br />
Ian’s penis soon starts to harden again, rubbing up Sasha’s leg. “Sorry, I’m…” Ian starts to say before Sasha places her hand on his mouth. <br />
“Hush, just enjoy the moment.” Sasha replies as she moves her body so that his cock was between her legs. She rubs her slit back and forth on the large member, making them both moan softly. Ian takes his free hand and places it on Sasha’s cheek. <br />
“I want you so bad right now.” Ian says. <br />
<br />
“Me too.” Sasha replies as she lets him lay her down on a stack of hay. <br />
<br />
Ian takes his hand off of her breast and moves it down to his own cock, rubbing it’s head on her slit between her legs. He places his penis head just inside her slit. “Last chance to back out.” <br />
<br />
Sasha grabs Ian’s penis and pulls it into her, breaking her for the first time. “I want this.” She replies, as Ian’s thrusts turn her pain into pleasure. The two-start kissing as Ian slowly moves his new member back and forth inside Sasha and she moves her hips in rhythm. <br />
On the second floor of the barn, Jacob shakes his head as he realizes what his sister is doing. “I thought I was the one that was going to get in trouble with dad today.” He whispers to himself as he returns to look out into the storm. <br />
<br />
Sitting on a box, Jacob looks out a window as he hears Ian and Sasha get more intimate with each other. While looking out, he sees a horse along the tree line. “I wonder why that horse is just standing there.” Jacob wondered. As he looked at the horse, the horse’s eye flashed red as a flash of lighting shot across the sky. <br />
<br />
Jacob leans back, shaking his head. He grabs his head with one hand, “what was that?” he whispered before he felt a strange feeling from his groin. Jacob places both hands over his own manhood as the feeling grew more and more. Thunder muffled him falling off the box as he starts squeezing at his penis threw his own shorts. <br />
<br />
Jacob starts moaning, as his penis and balls starts growing under his fingers. They quickly fill out his old pants and start straining the seams. Slowly, his pants start ripping as his member grows longer and thicker, his balls putting pressure on his thighs. Then, for the first time that he knew of, he started to get a boner. <br />
<br />
He pulls at his pants trying to get them off. But it was too late. As he unbuttons his pants, his zipper pops and his growing manhood flies out to his face, pressing his briefs out of the way. He then tosses his shirt so he could see better.  Laying on his back, Jacob starts to breathe heavily as his penis thickens and stretches to his bellybutton and past. The now eight-inch monster was now staring him in the face and was as hard as could be. He tried to place his small hand around the rode, but his fingers didn’t touch each other. <br />
<br />
As his Sasha and Ian get louder as the get closer to their climax, Jacob feel is balls almost turning as they filled with seed. He groaned as he moves both his hands to his side and trusts his hips up onto the air. In the silhouette of the lightning, Jacob could see vines on his penis and what he could only describe as a ring in the middle. His body contorts as it tries to thrust his hips higher. Jacob has tears in his eyes, not from pain, but just the pressure that was building up in him.<br />
<br />
A third and final thrust comes and Jacob finally cums a long rope of seed just over his head. He could hear at the same time Sasha and Ian both scream in ecstasy. As Jacob catches his breath, he waited for his sister to poke fun at him for his situation. He rolled over and got to his knees. His hard penis head was now past his knees, leaning on the floor. <br />
 <br />
But jokes never came. That’s because downstairs, Ian had felt Sasha slowly get tighter and tighter around him. he could have bet he was inside her womb. And he was right. As they had sex, his cock grew larger inside of Sasha. Looking down, Ian realized that he was a good several inches outside of Sasha as he was also pressed all the way back. Their mixed juices plopping on the floor from between them. He slowly pulls his penis out, noticing the new ‘ring’ on it before he ‘plops’ it’s head out of her and between her legs in the hay. <br />
<br />
“That was… I can’t describe it.” Sasha says looking at Ian. <br />
<br />
“Neither can I.” Ian replies.</p>
