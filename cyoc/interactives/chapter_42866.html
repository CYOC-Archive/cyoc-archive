<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was nigh on a year ago. I had been invited to a ball in the West kingdom and it was there I first laid eyes on Princess Sara. Of course I had no time to talk to her. My date for the evening would not have been pleased with that and besides it would be inappropriate to court Princess Sara at a banquet of her fathers. The Princess struck me as a divine beauty, one that I must have no matter the cost. From that day on I began writing letters to request a formal meeting with the king of the West that I might court his daughter. I hoped for a gentleman's agreement. Her hand in marriage to strengthen the relationship of our two kingdoms. However, I was simply blown off and one does not simply shrug off my affections without reason. When I heard news of the Princesses kidnapping I immediately formulated a plan. Sending scouts from our military across the lands to find information I was quick to discern her location. I came hundreds of miles, traveled for days without rest to rescue Princess Sara and take her hand in marriage. I will not have my work foiled by some pathetic excuse for a Prince that got himself turned into a calf and now lies bawling at the Princesses feet! Why she'd choose such a disgrace over I, the dashing Prince Todd, is beyond me. Clearly the girl has been in captivity too long. I must disarm the hysterical woman before she causes more mischief with that wand.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Princess, don't even think of using that wand again!&quot; I say, holding my sword toward her. Better to frighten the girl into surrendering until her thoughts become more rational. <br />
<br />
&quot;I rescued you and in return I get to take you as my bride. It is tradition! Now come along or do I have to make you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She closes her eyes. I misjudged the girl, she's lost all ability to see reason. The mad woman raises the wand towards me. I lunge at her, I must break that wand before she does something.....<br />
<br />
KAAAZZZAAP!!<br />
<br />
I feel my bones become soft. My feet no longer touch the ground, for a moment I feel like I am suspended in the air. The feeling in my arms and legs just... dissipates until it feels like I have none at all. Even my body feels different, it has a strange texture to it. I can no longer smell the thick stench of the pig sty. Instead all I smell is a pleasant, dusty smell as I gently float to the ground. The landing is soft as if cushioned by a sponge. I lay there unable to move staring up at the sky. Theres a baby crying somewhere but it doesn't sound close. I can hear a cow, or maybe several cows, faintly off in the distance. Everything seems so strange. The princess walks into view. She towers above me, her legs alone look the size of castle walls. I've never seen something so huge its breathtaking but I don't seem to need to breath right now. Her enormous arm reaches down and I feel her hand clasp hold of me lifting me into the air. The force of her grip should be crushing me but theres nothing to crush. Its like I'm made from feathers, I'm so soft and light. Even the gentle breeze as she walks holding me is enough to make my new form bend and fold. I can tell we are inside now. I'm not sure how but I still feel as if I can see. Its like watching the world around me from a dark room, peering through the cracks in the walls all at once.<br />
<br />
I'm settled down on a hard surface at about her waist height. I see she carries a baby in one arm but she moves away. Theres faint splashing of water. Her voice can just be made out along with a babies laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go. All clean!&quot; The happiness in her voice warms my heart, &quot;Now lets get you clothed young man. We can't have a little Prince going around nak-ee can we?&quot; they both giggle.<br />
<br />
A shadow forms over me and I feel a weight pressing down on me. The Princess grabs me and folds me around the heavy mass on top of me. Whatever it is its warm and moving.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go, snug as a bug!&quot;<br />
Its the baby, I'm some sort of garment for the baby. This cannot be, I'm a person not an object! I cannot move, I cannot even begin to struggle! The Princess must surely realize its me. <br />
<br />
An eternity passes as I feel the child's every move pressing down on me. I feel it breathing. I wobble from side to side as it crawls across the ground. All the while the Princess encourages it on, talks to it. Never acknowledging me. Then it happens. The infants stomach rumbles. I realize exactly what I am just in time to begin panicking but theres nothing I can do. I'm filled with warmth and soaked to my core. I suddenly feel a great weight placed on me. I'm nothing but <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Every time she smiles at me I'm filled with such joy I can't help but smile back or laugh. Something about seeing her happy makes me happy. I feel quite embarrassed naked in the water, Sara running a cloth all over me including places I'd rather her not touch. When she does I get so insecure tears start to well up but she just gives me a smile and talks to me and I forget. I'm a chubby little baby and the Princess is so huge and powerful right now. I'm seeing her in a different way again. She was bigger than me when I was a pig, and even a calf, but now? I feel so safe around her and she seems so happy! She lifts me up and dries me off with a towel. She raises me above her head and spins around! Its like I'm flying! Bringing me down she kisses me all over and my heart aches as if in love.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go. All clean!&quot; she beams, &quot;Now lets get you clothed young man. We can't have a little Prince going around nak-ee can we?&quot; I giggle a little embarrassed. She saw me naked when I was a pig but this is different. I'm human now and male and she's seen 'it' now. She puts me down and diapers me. Oh god I hope I don't have to use it in front of her! I saw the wand break but hopefully she can find a way to change me back soon. She carries me into the witches bedroom. Theres a cow in there. I think its silly at first, 'cows don't live in houses' i think, then I remember its Morgana. I think my minds getting more infantile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hows goes the hunt 'mooo-gana'?&quot; Sara laughs, the cow mooes loudly and fiercely in reply. It scares me a little. Its so huge I don't want mommy to make it cross, I mean Sara. Somehow Sara notices me get scared and comforts me &quot;Don't worry sweetie-pie, we'll get you all grown up again. You just sit tight on the bed. Can you do that for me honey?&quot; I nod.<br />
<br />
Theres not alot to do on the bed. I crawl around for a bit watching as the big cow and the Princess look through books. I giggle at the cow trying to turn pages with its tongue, then its teeth. It eats more than a couple of pages out of instinct before mommy gets cross and has to turn the pages for it. It takes me a while to notice the wet warmth building in my nappy and when I do I notice something else. Theres a building pressure in my bowels. It starts to hurt, I have to stop moving completely and shut my eyes as I fill my diaper. Its heavy and wet now. My lip starts shaking uncontrollably and I have to cry. I'm a man not a baby!<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww did my little man have an accident?&quot; I say to him knowing full well what happened - I can smell him from across the room. I don't know why I'm treating him like a real baby it just feels right. &quot;Lets get you cleaned up. Poo what a smelly bottom you have!&quot;<br />
<br />
I carry him into the kitchen again carefully removing the dirty diaper that had been a Prince. Spoilt Prince to soiled pants. Its not like he really deserved it but I doubt he'd forgive me if I changed him back, maybe leaving him this way is for the best. He might not even be alive anymore! I put the dirty thing to one side and wash off baby Serath. I'll wash the diaper to reuse later. When I'm done with Serath I take him into the witches room again. Holding him against my breasts. I figure I might as well let him enjoy the perks of being like this. Particularly the two soft, pert perks he's snuggled upto right now. Besides I'm enjoying it too. I never would have thought Serath would have been so cute as a babe and being able to make a grown man laugh like a little baby by making funny faces or pressing my lips against his belly and blowing is alot of fun. When I change him back there will always be this part of us both that remembers him as a cute little baby who is entirely dependant on me.<br />
<br />
As I look through one of the spell books I come across something and can only describe it as fate. A spell to make my breasts lactate! I try it without a second thought. I remove my dress and chant the incantation. My small pert, bosom shapes into two bouncing globes. My delicate pink nipples darken and erect. They feel a little sore and look swollen but I know they're now ready to feed my little babby. He awoke during my incantation and watched as my little tits became gigantic boobs.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Now you get to have real baby milk, cutie&quot; I say raising him to my breast. His gummy mouth latches on and he starts to suckle. Before long I can feel him drinking away and I see he's dribbling quite a bit down the side of his face.<br />
<br />
I continue reading through the book until I find...</p>
