<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Duncan howled a few more times, before letting himself fall to the ground in a fit of complete misery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Dunc,&quot; said Emeralda sweetly, &quot;Enjoy yourself, the night is still young.<br />
<br />
She scratched the part behind his ear, smirking at the half goofy looking / half ferocious looking wolf.<br />
<br />
Duncan, despite himself, perked up a few seconds, before relizing what he was doing and deciding to growl in anger.  Duncan also realizd the only way he could get back to normal was find someone, someone who'd believe he was human.  Maybe then he'd be able to find a psychic, a witch, or maybe some other gypsy who could turn him back to normal.<br />
<br />
Duncan's first thought was to try and drive his car, but he realized the smirking (yet still hot) Esmeralda was holding his keys.  He decided to run for, or crawl for it, or whatever you call what wolves do when they race on all fours.  <br />
<br />
Duncan made pretty good time racing along the dirt track.  Unfortunately for him, though, Esmeralda was slowly following in his car, cheering him on.<br />
<br />
&quot;That't the way, Dunc,&quot; she told him.  &quot;Be a wolf, run on all fours.  Come on, Dunc, I love it when you howl.  Give me a howl, only an alpha male like you can give a howl like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, whenever the moon shined through the trees, Duncan felt compelled to give one of his howls.  Once an stag crossed his path.  Duncan ended up ripping into the deer's body with his bloody muzzle, and  chewing on the raw meat for nearly fifteen minutes.  It was only then he could control his instincts and continue on his way.  <br />
<br />
Esmeralda was overjoyed to see him kill the deer.  &quot;Come on Dunc,&quot; she told him sexily.  &quot;Be a real wolf, like you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duncan finally got to the deserted highway, at about 4:00 in the morning.  He knew what he was looking for.  About ten miles distant, in the opposite direction of the motel, there was a small police station in a small village.  The police would naturally be suspicious of a wolf in clothes, so he'd proably somehow be able to communicate he could write (and tell his story) before they shot him.  First he had to lose Esmeralda.  That he wasn't able to do, whenever he tried to hide and lose her in the edge of the woods, off the road, she was always waiting on the highway, in his own car.  What was worse, was that she was always honking the horn, driving him bonkers as the noise hurt his sensative wolf ears.<br />
<br />
Finally, at sunrise he reached the deserted village.  Finally, he was near the police station, Esmeralda smirkingly driving behind.  He was just down the street, he could see it.  Then . . . <br />
<br />
He was wracked in pain. He fall flat on the sidewalk.  It was a terrible bone crushing pain.  He felt it in his muzzle, his tail, his paws, his chest and his feet.  He was being crushed like a tin can, then it stopped.  His ears, his teeth, his tongue were on fire.  Then it stopped.  The next thing he knew he felt a terrible itching.  Then it stopped.  In less than five minutes he was able to come to his four feet again.  Only he couldn't.<br />
<br />
He was human again.  Unless he wanted to crawl with his knees down, he couldn't walk on four feet. Elated Duncan brought himself up to look in the window.  It had taken him a long time to transform to wolf, but his change back was close to instantaneous.  His clothes and shoes were still ripped, but he was back to normal.  Almost, his ears were still rather pointed, and his teeth somewhat too sharp, and his face still had a five o' clock shadow.  Little did he know what importance this would mean to his future life.  But most importantly, he knew he was human again.<br />
<br />
Before he realized it, Esmeralda rushed into his arms.  She barraged him with kisses.  Duncan tried to seperate himself from her clutches, he obviously didn't know what her game was, and there was no way he liked being changed into a wolf.  But when a guy has a girl like Esmeralda throw herself at him, his immediatly reaction is to give in and sort things out later.<br />
<br />
Duncan gave in to his immediate reaction, and did what (as a human) he was natuarally inclined to do.  He smirked.</p>
