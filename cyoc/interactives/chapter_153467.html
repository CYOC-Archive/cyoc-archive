<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam looked for what seemed like an hour as he looked over each option and then thinking about what he wanted to become. He thought about being a bear, but the thought of living outside was not appealing. He then saw a section called living toys.

<br />
Sam is going to give himself to his nephew for his second birthday tomorrow. Once he finalized his transformation, Sam calls his brother and tells him what Sam was doing and Sam’s brother was excited about it and planed to pick Sam up after he was done with work.<br />
<br />
Sam then gets directed to the transformation line. First, he is directed to strip down and donate his clothes. Sam felt a little insecure about his body but everyone was naked might as well join.<br />
<br />
Sam sees at the head of the line is a man in his 70&#39;s enter a glass chamber and after a bright blue light, a pigeon was left behind and begins to fly around the box until an attendant came in and trapped the bird and took it away.<br />
<br />
Next a set of triplet women entered and after the light fades, a three headed dog was left behind and a man that looks like a brother leads them away after putting on a collar on each head.<br />
<br />
“Wow that is cool.” Sam exclaimed as the man left.<br />
<br />
“I know. They were my neighbors from down the street. They were inseparable when they were kids,” said a man ahead of you. He was in his early thirties, balding, and heavyset with a full beard.<br />
<br />
“Is it permanent?” asked Sam.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes. They also lowered their intelligence to a dogs. They are a gift to their brother’s kids. They have always wanted a dog, and they are immortal, so they will be the family dog for the generations to come. Where are my manners? I am Paul,” said the man.<br />
<br />
“Hi I am Sam for now. What are you becoming?”<br />
<br />
“I am becoming a polar bear skin rug for the winter. My boyfriend just became a taxidermied Moose head.” Paul points out a Moose head along the wall.<br />
<br />
“Why are you doing that?”<br />
<br />
“Oh we lost a game of cards against a couple we know. We all own a cabin up north. So we will be displayed there. Another couple who lost to us before ended up as a taxidermied muskie and 12 point buck head for a year and are still there. So we will not be alone. Knowing the couple who won they will probably end up turning themselves into something for the cabin themselves and rent the cabin for the winter and join us. I hope someone at least once has sex on me. That would feel so good. I also made it that I am machine washable so I am an easy clean, ” said Paul with some glee and joy. “What are you turning into?”<br />
<br />
As he asked this as you both watch a teenage girl enter the chamber. After the light fads, jockstrap falls to the floor and an attendant hands it to a teenage boy with a football jersey on.<br />
<br />
“Oh I am becoming a living teddy bear for my nephew until he turns 18. I will be as smart as him as he grows. It is for his second birthday.” said Sam.<br />
<br />
“Aw that is too sweet. You will be a great companion for him.”<br />
<br />
Next up was a woman and a man in their fifties. They entered and what was left behind a marble statue of a two braided ribbons in the shape of a heart. Many people in the room let out an “aw” and clapped.<br />
<br />
After that was Paul.<br />
<br />
“Have fun on your adventure little bear,” said Paul with a smile and with that he entered the chamber. A few seconds later a polar bear skin rug was left in his place.<br />
<br />
Now it was Sam’s turn.<br />
<br />
Sam entered into the chamber. The doors closed with a snap and then there was a bright blue light.<br />
<br />
Next things Samual was aware that he was small and laying on the floor. He got up with a little difficulty with his new puggy legs and wobbled to the door. Before he got there, an attendant came to collect him.<br />
<br />
“Oh you are too cute. Would you like to be carried, little bear?” asked the attendant.<br />
<br />
Samual nodded yes and the attendant lifted him away and hugged him close. It felt good to be carried and hugged, but Billy will hug Samual more tomorrow. The attendant took Samual to a room with a sign Samual couldn’t read. That made Samual nervous for a moment, but then he remembered that he was as smart as Billy and Billy couldn’t read yet nor could he yet. The attendant then laid out Samual on a counter full of boxes and wrapping things.<br />
<br />
“Now I am going to get you ready for your big day tomorrow. Do you want to sleep until then in your gift box until your new owner unwraps you?” said the attendant.<br />
<br />
Samual thought about it and he didn’t want to be in the dark box alone for long. So he nodded yes with urgency.<br />
<br />
“Okay. To do that all you have to do is lay perfectly still and imagine closing your eyes. Once you do you will enter a status mode until your owner picks you up or if you are sleeping with your owner until he wakes up. We will also be giving your owner&#39;s father a booklet on how to care for you and what to do if something goes wrong like you are lost or misplaced.” explained the attendant.<br />
<br />
Samual laid on the counter and closed his eyes and he went to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next thing Samual knew he was being hugged by Billy and there was people everywhere and wrapping paper on the ground. Samual was so overjoyed he hugged back as hard as he could to tell Billy he loved him.</p>
