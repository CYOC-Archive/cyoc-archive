<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reality shifted, changing Jeff&#39;s old bedroom to a storage room. Memories of Jeff faded from his his family&#39;s minds. Jeff wriggled around , now just a stupid anxious sperm looking to fertilize an egg. Jeff was nothing more then a load of cum in his brother&#39;s balls. He could just as easily be squirted into a tissue as impregnate a woman.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s brother, Jake luckily was away at college, surrounded with plenty of opportunity to fertilize an egg. His brother had yet to settle with one girl, taking advantage of having an open field with new options to explore since having broken up with his high school sweetheart, Jen, that he&#39;d dated since middle school. Currently he was horny as heck as he was walking back to the dorm of a new girl he&#39;d met in class, Erica was her name.<br />
<br />
&quot;My room mate should be at a class right now,&quot; whispered Erica excitedly as she fumbled with her key to the dorm room. With a groan it opened as Jake lunged to kiss her, unable to wait any longer as he knocked them through the door and onto the floor of her dorm room. Erica had been correct, given the low-light of the afternoon which permeated the room instead of the bright florescent overhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you wait until I close the door?&quot; asked Erica, a little annoyed at having the guy dressed in basketball shorts, socks, and flip flops having pushed her to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... it just you&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; said Jake as he pulled back a bit as she squirmed to get out from under him.<br />
<br />
Erica, feeling the pressure of his erect penis through the flimsy shorts and knowing she really needed to let off some stress from the upcoming psych test she was taking the day after tomorrow, sighed and kicked the door closed as best she could from her position, causing it to slam loudly and have more than a few of her neighbors shout obcsenities and pound on the walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do this on the bed,&quot; said Erica, with what sounded to Jake a sultry invite, but really was her reasoning she didn&#39;t want any rug burns.<br />
<br />
Jake allowed her to get up and started to take off his jacket and baseball cap, but Erica stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no... you&#39;re in my room right now, and if you want to relieve that monster down there, you&#39;re gonna have to play by my rules.&quot; She then settled on her bed, allowing her flowing clothes to settle and hint at the curves and lines of her own body.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica smirked. &quot;Take off your jacket, slowly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake, confused as to why she was drawing things out, obliged as if he were taking off his jacket normally, quickly unzipping the zipper in a fluid motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not like that...&quot; sighed Erica, who was starting to think that it was a mistake to bring a Freshman back to her dorm, even if he did look kinda cute.<br />
<br />
It was then Jake&#39;s mind caught up with where Erica wanted him to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... you mean, you want me to... tease you, just a bit?&quot; asked Jake, as he shrugged his jacket off his shoulders just a bit, not fully taking them off, but revealing a bit of the muscle he&#39;d been investing in gaining since sophmore year of high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice and slow cowboy. You might be all erect and ready to burst, but this girl needs a bit of enticement to be fully ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like she doesn&#39;t appreciate what I have to give...&quot; said Jake, catching on quick now that he understood what game she wanted him to play, he started to pull his jacket back up on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
She stopped his motion by leaning her foot out to keep his jacket where it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said strip,&quot; she commanded.<br />
<br />
Jake looked down at the foot near the crook of his elbow, he wasn&#39;t particularly happy about how close it was to his face, but if it wasn&#39;t for his raging hard-on, he&#39;d have spoiled the mood further by asking her to move the foot. Instead, he decided to try and take some authority back from her, as he let his jacket slip from his one arm, and brought his hand up to her outstretched leg, and slowly began stroking it moving his hands along just above her shaved legs barely allowing it to touch her skin as his hand moved up her skirt and to her inner thigh. She grabbed his forearm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, who said you could do that,&quot; she said with a slightly aroused growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; he said as he shrugged the other half of his jacket off the other arm and brought his other hand up to where she&#39;d stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless, of course, you don&#39;t like it,&quot; he teased as he gently stroked and then stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see how good you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
The foreplay continued, far longer than what Jake was used to with his usual fucks, but it was proving to be a bit fun to tease and drive someone else crazy as they slowly stripped and made out. By the time they were naked and ready to do the deed, Jake had completely forgotten about his stash of condoms in his wallet, and just wanted to be in her and done with it all, and she wasn&#39;t in disagreement. She assured him that she was on the pill anyway, and so Jake began to thrust into her, soon releasing his seed into Erica&#39;s waiting womb. Although Erica was indeed on the pill, she had forgotten to take it this week what with the psych exam that was coming up.<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel himself rush through a narrow opening along with tons of other sperm and soon had the urge to swim swim swim! He had one goal, fertilize the egg. The chronivac had made sure Jeff would be born, all the sperm were identical to him. Soon the egg was fertilized and Jeff would be born once more.</p>
