<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timothy stood before his bedroom mirror clutching the empty black bottle.  &quot;Every Girl's Dream Potion&quot; he <br />
read <br />
it over and over 100 times.  He could feel the churning in his stomach and the pulse of his heart as his veins <br />
pumped the foreign fluid throughout his body.  He could even feel his skin itching and knew the change <br />
couldn't be far off.  Being small and unpopular most of his life Timothy couldn't help but be excited.  He <br />
hoped this would be his turning moment, he could end up a big jock or a hot actor.  Maybe even be Zac Efron.  <br />
His eyes glazed over at the thought of possessing those large muscles and having girls everywhere faint at his <br />
smile.  But he could feel the itching intensify and knew he wouldn't have much longer to wait to see what he <br />
ended up.  His height slowly began to increase. <br />
<br />
     Being body shy, Timothy was still wearing all his clothes which weren't taking his new height well.  <br />
Already his pale, flat stomach was fully exposed, and his jeans now rested just below his knees but nothing <br />
was too much tighter thankfully.  He smiled, almost jumping in joy as his skin began to tan from his ghastly <br />
shade but it settled a few shades too light to be Zac's, much to his <br />
disappointment.  His muscles also began to grow, but again not as much as he had hoped.  His chest pushed out <br />
developing some slight tone, like a teen athlete maybe or someone who takes care of themselves.  Nothing like <br />
a model or dedicated bodybuilder.  His pecs were very neatly outlined against his shirt and he could see the <br />
beginning of a six pack which was more than he had before at least.  While he admired his toned stomach <br />
Timothy saw something that made his face pale.  An invisible hand seemed to be drawing something there, a very <br />
small bird.  Timothy wasn't the most well versed kid but he knew who this tattoo belonged to.  His thoughts <br />
whirred as he wondered if he could make himself throw up the potion, or maybe go back for an antidote?  But <br />
no, he didn't even know where the shop was and he had maybe minutes left.  It was already too late.  Already <br />
his arms were developing a decent amount of muscle to match his chest and more tattoos were scrawling <br />
themselves across his body including several on his left arm.  He banged his head against he mirror in sadness <br />
and frustration, feeling his legs grow longer and more muscular and his feet get bigger to match.  True, he <br />
wasn't pale and frail anymore, but was this really worth it?  His face, he knew it was going to go sooner or <br />
later.  He watched it barely seem to age despite the difference in years, becoming almost androgynous in <br />
appearance as his hair shortened on the side and thrust itself straight up in spikes.  <br />
<br />
     The only thing worse than now wearing Justin Bieber's infamous face was that he could even hear Justin's <br />
thoughts in his own mind and he knew very soon they would be inseparable from his own.  Against his will he <br />
slowly removed his shirt, feeling a smile flick into place.  A practiced swag fell upon his stance as he <br />
dripped cockiness and began to <br />
tease himself in the mirror.  'Practicing' for his fans.  Wait, no, he didn't have fans.  He was just a nerdy <br />
loner.  Shut up, said a louder voice in his head, you are a teen idol, you are every girl's dream, just like <br />
you wanted to be.  Accept it.  He felt all the good and bad flood him, he remembered starting off being just a <br />
naive boy who liked to sing, he remembered the fame how he lusted for more.  How he enjoyed the attention.  He <br />
felt a new craving for love struck girls, for weed, for luxury.  All the corruption of the spotlight driving <br />
his old self out.  He yelped, and noticed even his voice was the voice of Bieber's now.  He removed the last <br />
of his clothes, admiring his slightly larger equipment and his toned but youthful appearance.  He struggled <br />
for a moment more before being completely silenced.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Wassup, how you like being every girls dream nerd boy?  Hope you like it, I sure do...&quot; said the new <br />
Justin <br />
as he asserted himself and prepared to go out and score.</p>
