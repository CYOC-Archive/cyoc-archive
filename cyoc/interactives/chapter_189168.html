<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;d like to thank you for your help,&quot; Nate said to Muxing as he set about planting the cherry trees that Shuixing and/or her sisters had gotten him as a wedding present for him and Shuixing.<br />
<br />
The process of planting the trees wasn&#39;t that hard, as the soil that was there was fairly soft, though Nate had also made sure to get in some proper top soil and peat moss to assure that the trees would get a chance to grow strong and viable on the patch of ground that he&#39;d been allotted on Heiya Island. It was closer to the trail that lead up to the mountain on the island&#39;s southern end and had a pair of other fields that were on the other two sides of it, though Nate also noted that those other fields were kept a bit lower than the ground where he was planting the trees in order to grow rice, which Nate assumed was for the Humans that had come to reside on Heiya Island after the cooperation between the island and Interpol to house a few groups of people rescued from various sorts of cults and criminal gangs not unlike those that had kidnapped Shuixing and her sisters.<br />
<br />
His present helper, however, was not his wife, Shuixing, but her sister Muxing. Shuixing was presently going over her own training routine for the day and catching up on it while the two had enjoyed some time on Mieni Atoll for their honeymoon. Shuixing had also mentioned something of a tour and visiting Maelewano at some point, but with much of the world still dealing with Covid, that was decided to be saved for another day and when things on the global stage had finally eased off on that department. That left him with Muxing, who had been there when Nate had visited and some of the decorative cherry trees that had been planted on Heiya Island were in bloom, and Muxing proved to be a very good helper and was a bit relaxed while Nate dug the holes and then placed the trees in them, doing his best to make sure they&#39;d stand upright.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Muxing answered as she stood by and watched Nate pat the earth around the trunk of the tree to make sure everything was firm enough that it would stand, &quot;the others have training today, Liao has her first day at Samurai Prep... I still don&#39;t get why that name when none of us here have noble heritage, but that&#39;s a different issue... and well, you&#39;ve joined the family and that was worth providing the help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again... thank you,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;It&#39;s also something that&#39;s let me catch up on what went on here while Shuixing and I were on honeymoon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the two of you missed was the rest of us sitting as judges for the martial arts tournament,&quot; Muxing gave a laugh, &quot;it was interesssting... but nothing super special.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then paused and thought back on some of the events from back in July...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The IAC on Heiya Island revolved a lot around martial arts and related subjects. There were weapons demonstrations and skill challenges In many ways it was set up to fit much of the themes that Heiya Island has been set up for, particularly with the Five Elements taking up residence on the island. Normally the Five Elements would look to compete in the tournament, but at present they were down one member as Shuixing was off on her honeymoon. That left the remaining members of the Five Elements to sit as judges for the skills competition, though they also found that there were also other judges that had either mastered some other form of martial arts or at least understood the application of their respective move sets on paper to see if the various contestants knew what they were doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;re to judge and compare the various styles that are all present here,&quot; Huoxing commented as she looked down the list of contestants. Many of them were fellow Heiya Island residents, some of whom the Five Elements were giving some lessons to in their respective styles, but there were also a fair number of other contestants that came from various other parts of the world, and usually one of the Animalian colonies. It was rare that there was an Animalian competitor that didn&#39;t live in one of the Animalian colony cities, but occasionally one did show up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some are those that we&#39;ve given some basic lessons to,&quot; Jinxing commented, &quot;we can surely compare them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about those that have worked with a different martial art or have studied a bit with one of the other instructors here?&quot; Huoxing asked as she continued to look over the list, &quot;I mean... sure there are other judges, but I&#39;d suspect we&#39;d be asked to give comparisons that are based on our knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can do that,&quot; Muxing said rolling her head, &quot;you know that. What&#39;s really got you so nervous?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to say something dumb in front of Gang,&quot; Huoxing admitted.<br />
<br />
The others turned their heads to the crowds that were present to watch the skills challenges, and there seated next to one of the girls rescued by Interpol was a Tibetan boy with glasses. Fang had largely recovered from the kidnapping and attempted brainwashing that a human sex trafficking ring had taken her on, but she had bonded to Huoxing in her recovery and had settled into one of the apartments that wasn&#39;t too far from where the Five Elements lived. After a time, her brother Gang came to visit and so Fang&#39;s protection and had struck up a good friendship with Huoxing as well, though he was a bit shy. Over time he&#39;d been getting better, and that left Huoxing hopeful for a little romance of her own. Though this again got Muxing to roll her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Muxing answered, &quot;just retain your focus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huoxing gulped, as generally &quot;serious focus&quot; wasn&#39;t her thing. She enjoyed having fun, telling jokes, and helping people smile, as it had been one of the things that helped her and her sisters in their experience and what she felt also helped Fang recover. The truly serious one in their group was Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muxing is right,&quot; Tuxing said in an assuring voice and placed one hand on Huoxing&#39;s shoulder, &quot;you will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muxing ultimately took some pleasure in being right that Huoxing would be fine. She knew that Huoxing liked to have fun and be cheerful, particularly now that Gang had arrived and granted her the opportunity for companionship that went beyond her sisters. But Muxing also knew that Huoxing could maintain her focus with her training and her own skills. All that Huoxing was worrying over now was just nervous jitters over being in a judging position and essentially being a judge on &quot;stage.&quot; And Muxing privately felt her &quot;pep&quot; talk worked.<br />
<br />
They watched through all the contestants compete and execute the various skill challenges. They varied across various different martial arts and members of the Elements present actually felt they learned a bit just by discussing with the other judges that had come from other  schools. It was something that worked out well and even pleased the present Element members that so many Animalians were interested in martial arts. And while none had really &quot;mastered&quot; the skills they practiced, they were still fairly good. There were eight Turtle Animalians from Lyre that entered and did especially well, though they still ended up finishing outside the top three. They all seemed pleased with what they managed and even thanked them for being allowed to participate. They were polite and helpful, though Muxing also felt that the males were a bit too bulky to be particularly good martial artists, but they still did surprisingly well and that was worth something.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure if you and your sisters could have won if you competed,&quot; Nate commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but we weren&#39;t competing... largely as we&#39;ve been a bit of a team,&quot; Muxing answered, &quot;and you and Shuixing were on your honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which was great,&quot; Nate gave a smile, &quot;but I&#39;d bet you don&#39;t want the details on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muxing nodded, &quot;I am happy you have made my sister very happy. That doesn&#39;t mean I want to know about everything the two of you do in bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you again for the help with the trees,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;hopefully they&#39;ll produce well when they&#39;re big enough and healthy enough to produce fruit. They&#39;ll then make for good pies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to take your word for it,&quot; Muxing answered, &quot;as a Viper... I can only eat meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate only nodded.</p>
