<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Professor Benito slowly walked forward he entered the court room. His lawyer helped him to his seat, ensuring his recent neck brace would not cause him too much pain. <br />
Across the room sat the reason for all of his recent pain, Carmichael Gomez (or Cargo to his friends since he was as big as a truck). The young man looked positively massive in a tight fitting suit, though this young titan wore a worried expression as the professor took his seat.<br />
<br />
Judge Loggia had been reviewing this case for some time as it had made state wide news. &quot;Local College Linebacker - Looking at Life in Prison&quot; and &quot;College Athlete turned College Attempted Murder&quot; were among his favorites. The judge knew this would be one of his favorite rulings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gentlemen, I understand the plaintiff wishes to present the defendant with a plea deal before these proceedings begin?&quot; Judge Loggia asked. <br />
<br />
The professor&#39;s young lawyer nods and stands. &quot;Yes your honor. After discussion with the defense we&#39;ve come to a conclusion that&#39;ll satisfy both parties. Cargo scoffed at that statement, causing his lawyer to nudge him. The young lawyer continued. &quot;Considering that Professor Benito will not be able to pay for his own medical expenses after Mr. Gomez allegedly pushed him down the stairs, we&#39;ve offered the defense a swap with the duration of 10 years. As Mr. Gomez has already accepted a plea deal from the distract attorney serving 12 years in the local state prison, his medical expenses in my client&#39;s body will be adhered to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cargo clenched his fist tightly, his scared expression turning to rage. The judge looked at the young man and shook his head. He&#39;d seen so many like him. Young, naive, full of passion. Not to mention handsome. Mr. Gomez had a tightly cut light brown buzzcut that accentuated his rugged face and even looking pissed up he had a smoldering pout. A 6&#39;9 linebacker with gritted teeth would be some men&#39;s worse nightmare, but for Judge Loggia guys like this left him feeling satisfied when his rulings came. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does the defense accept this deal?&quot; the judge asked. Cargo&#39;s lawyer was about to speak when he angrily pushed him aside and into the courthouse wall. He stood and screamed, &quot;Hell no! That fucker had it coming! I could&#39;ve fucking ended him! I should&#39;ve fucking ended him if he was gonna steal my body!&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge was glad the bailiff had the foresight to keep the defendant&#39;s handcuffs on. Cargo struggled fruitlessly to move anywhere but his chair and immediately failed. After a few threatening advances from security, the defendant calmed down. His lawyer stood up and sighed. &quot;Yes your honor we accept this plea.&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge just smirked. &quot;In light of recent behavior, I do not. Instead I rule that unless the defendent shows any behavioral improvements withing incarceration, the swap duration will be for life. As my ruling is final case close.&quot; He hit his gavel as a stunned court room gasped. <br />
<br />
Professor Benito was just as shocked. He could see his assailant angrily growl and threaten him from his restraints as he walked away. Outside he was immediately swarmed by the towering paparazzi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Benito! Professor! Is it true that you won your case and will be assuming the life of former student Carmichael Gomez!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Professor! Professor! Are you planning on pursuing Gomez&#39;s contract with the NFL?&quot;<br />
&quot;Professor! Do you think you&#39;ll still be qualified to teach Asian American History from the body of a predominantly Caucasian student?&quot;<br />
<br />
The questions were unending and as the professor tried to answer one question, he was immediately drowned out by several more questions. In the end his lawyer escorted him to a town car, where the were both driven away to the swapping facility. <br />
<br />
&quot;Professor Benito, I&#39;m sorry about the defendant&#39;s outburst, but this is great! Not many people come out with as much as you&#39;ve gained today!&quot; his lawyer praised.<br />
&quot;Please, I&#39;ve told you many times to just call me Angelo,&quot; the professor coughed out with a flinch. Each exhaustive breath still hurt. <br />
&quot;Of course, sorry Angelo. I&#39;m just so excited. This was my first case and it was a huge win for me and my pro bono initiative! Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to help out more people like you. I may even get first pick of swaps since our company won that case against SwapTech.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angelo Benito just smiled at the young lawyer and his hopeful outlook. He was glad that he could help the firm help others like him, there was no doubt of that, but a ping of doubt still existed. As the exited the car to the hospital like swapping area, his reflection passed him on the way. He was no imposing man at only 5&#39;2 but his dark brown and graying hair still caused him to look distinguished if he stood up straight. Angelo had spent so many years getting used to this face, 53 to be exact. And soon he wouldn&#39;t be able to see this face again. <br />
<br />
He was well aware many would kill to be in his shoes, and truth be told he&#39;d often fantasized about so many similar scenarios in his past.  But now that was happening he was hesitating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are we sure they will take care of that young man?&quot; he asked his lawyer as the entered the swapping chambers. &quot;Of course! They have to take care of him to the best of their ability! If he dies in prison they have to pay you a pretty penny for damages. Now I&#39;ll leave you hear to change into your hospital gown. Once you&#39;re ready simply lay back into the swap pod and close your eyes. I hear it&#39;s like falling asleep.  In a few minutes you&#39;ll open your eyes and be looking at me through new eyes!&quot;<br />
<br />
His lawyer left. Angelo just sighed. He deposited his cloths and belongings into their designated bins and took one more look at himself in a nearby mirror. Before him was a nude Italian Filipino man who had a bit of a stomach. Despite his unique racial makeup his appearance was rather mundane. He took one more look at himself and stepped into the pod. After one deep breath he fell himself drifting off to sleep. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Angelo blinked a few times as his pod opened and the bright lights of a new room came into view. His lawyer was there and offered a hand to him to help him out. The professor reached forth, noticing how heavy his entire body felt, and was surprised to see a massive arm come into view. He hesitated for a moment taking note of this large apendage covered in course brown hair ending in a massive hand that dwarfed his lawyer&#39;s. Standing up was another shoking experience. Where his lawyer once towered over Benito at 6&#39;1, he now completely stood head and shoulder above the man. In fact, though this room looked identical to the one he was in previously, his new vantage made it look extremely different. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn. Profe- I mean Angelo, how&#39;re you feeling? I know this guy had a resting jerk face, but you&#39;re not angry right now are you? You&#39;ve kinda got a permanent tough guy scowl going.&quot; his lawyer said, trying to support this massive man.<br />
<br />
Angelo just shook his head, causing his head to spin. He clutched his head and was met with sharp bristles and an huge flexed arm that strained his hospital gown. <br />
<br />
&quot;The medical technicians said headaches could be a post swap side effect, just take it easy big guy. I&#39;ll go grab you some water and you can take a seat. When you&#39;re feeling up for it there&#39;s some clothes on the bed for you and your personal belongings too. Though I doubt you&#39;ll be able to fit any of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
His lawyer once again left, leaving Angelo alone with his thoughts. He took a seat and took a few deep breaths. It was a common tactic that&#39;d help him through stressful episodes in the past, though now his lung capacity appeared to be a lot larger than normal. Once his heartbeat normalized he discarded his hospital gown and laid it on the bed. He notice a double XL tag on it and was awestruck that such an article felt tight on him.  <br />
<br />
Just like his last room he saw a standing mirror in the corner and he realized what he wanted to do. He stood and with each new heavy step he approached. When he was in front of the mirror he realized he need to step back as he was now too tall to see anything but his new perfect pectoral muscles. <br />
<br />
When he was a good 6 feet away his heartbeat sped up once more. This perfectly carved  tower of muscle was him? Reflected back at him was his former student in all his nude glory. Starting from his feet he noticed how wide and long they looked as it spanned two of the facilities tiles of their tiled floor. This led up to pillars of thick calves and quads that could kick down any door. A sizeable manhood with light brown pubic hair surrounded his pelvis and hung limply at 8 inches. Working his way up he noticed a bit of a stomach that had some shape to it, though when he sucked in he could see some thick abs! At least he thought they were, it was tough to see past so much light brown hair covering his torso and under his arms. He used his new large hands to explore each firm edge of his body and eventually they wanted to his face. <br />
<br />
The handsome face of Carmichael was reflected back at him. A slight amount of stubble was beginning to form along his cheeks and his new dark green eyes looked back in complete observational surprise. He blinked a few times, still taking this all in. <br />
<br />
A knock on the door snapped him out of his stupor. &quot;Angelo? Are you decent in there?&quot; his lawyer half joked as he walked in. &quot;Shit! You&#39;re naked sorry!&quot; He immediately fumbled the water he was carrying it and spilled it all over the floor. &quot;I&#39;ll... get you a new water. Ok?&quot; He said already leaving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; the professor said, in his new bass baritone of a voice. That simple phrase was enough to shake the walls and cause his lawyer to jump again as he left. As the door closed Angelo was beginning to enjoy all of his new changes. With one familiar smirk, he knew he could get used to this.</p>
