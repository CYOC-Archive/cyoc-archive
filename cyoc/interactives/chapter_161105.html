<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Her name is Michelle. Not Karen. I started the second paragraph in the previous chapter by saying &quot;Karen entered this shop....&quot; I was merely trying to illustrate that Michelle has the stereotypical attitude of a &quot;Karen.&quot;</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the reverse wishing ring, there are no specific rules. If you wish to be rich, for example, it may make you poor and destitute. If you wish for someone else to be poor, it may make them rich instead. Or it may make you poor instead of the subject that you wished to be poor in the first place. Whatever wish one makes with this ring, it will turn out to be the opposite of what the person intended. <br />
<br />
Well, as you can imagine, the ring that Michelle purchased was the &quot;Reverse Wishing Ring.&quot; She placed both items inside her handbag, and quickly made her way to her car. <br />
<br />
She drove over to the school to pick up her boys, who were already dressed in their baseball practice uniforms. She took them over to the school&#39;s practice field, and sat with the other parents and watched on. It was boring. She had nothing in common with any of the other plebs. <br />
<br />
There was one woman in particular that made her roll her eyes, and have the urge to pick on. She knew her from since middle school. A skinny, light-skinned, flat-chested, orange-haired freak. She wasn&#39;t good looking at all. Matter of fact, she STILL had freckles. She never grew out of those, like most people do. So she sat there and rolled her eyes at this woman, Francine. <br />
<br />
Francine was....is....kind of on the boyish side, what with her chest that could never grow real boobs. She was picked on throughout middle school, and had few friends in high school. But the few friends she did have, were real true friends. Including her current husband. <br />
<br />
Michelle had to admit that Francine&#39;s husband was always kind of cute. Even if in a nerdy sort of way. Dark raven hair. Sharp green eyes. A masculine nose, and other masculine facial features. Despite his masculinity, he was younger looking than his years would suggest. Which made him really cute. Now, he&#39;s in great shape. Works out at the gym, and has a nicely toned manly body, and either shaves, or his body naturally doesn&#39;t grow a lot of hair. <br />
<br />
Their son is on her boys&#39; baseball team. He&#39;s their best friend, and primarily hangs out with him more than anyone else. He has the ginger hair, complexion, and freckles like his mom. But he inherited his father&#39;s cute masculine facial features. The kid was of medium build. Not &quot;fat,&quot; but also not exactly &quot;skinny&quot; either. <br />
<br />
Because Francine&#39;s boy was best friends with her two sons, Anthony and Vince, Michelle had to be at least cordial towards Francine. Which was awkward, as she used to bully Francine when they were kids. But the past was the past. They were all adults now, right? But Michelle still couldn&#39;t shake the strong urge to bully poor Francine. While she tried her hardest to remain cordial, she had this underlying Passive-aggressive &quot;Karen&quot; attitude she directed towards Francine all the time.<br />
<br />
Michelle was irritated. Being around them during her kids&#39; baseball practice wasn&#39;t enough, but she was surely going to be at that PTA meeting as well. Whatever. Michelle avoided eye contact with Francine at practice, and luckily, she seemed to be doing the same. <br />
<br />
The practice went well enough. It was cut short, for the coach knew there was the PTA that evening, and all the parents were at the practice waiting for it to be over so they could all go back to the school building. This was a different sort of meeting, where the teacher wanted to meet with the parents and the kids at the same time. I&#39;ll spare you the details of that meeting. It was boring, and useless. At least to you, the reader. <br />
<br />
What wasn&#39;t boring and useless....what was important to this story.....was the underhanded confrontation between Francine and Michelle. Well, ok. So the confrontation itself was kind of boring and largely useless. Suffice it to say, that Francine&#39;s boy, Jack, was top-of-the-class. As usual. And Francine was just &quot;GLOATING&quot; about it. At least, in Michelle&#39;s mind she was gloating. <br />
<br />
Ant and Vin, on the other hand, were C and D students. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever,&quot; thought Francine. &quot;At least I don&#39;t look like a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine never noticed the ring in her handbag glowing. Matter of fact, she forgot the ring and that medallion were even in there. At the end of the meeting, she picked up her bag, and drove home with her boys. <br />
<br />
That night, she stood in front of the bathroom mirror, checking herself out. No signs of wrinkles or age marks yet. She was still a young, striking-looking woman. Wide, blue eyes. Perfect vision. Perfect teeth. Perfectly even tan skin tone. Now flaws or blemishes. She was also nicely shaved everywhere. <br />
<br />
She then stood in front of the full body mirror, and checked herself over. Michelle would periodically check for lumps. Doing self-examinations. She was obsessed with her health and beauty. The word &quot;cancer&quot; left her somewhat paranoid. Not that she ever had cancer. It was just common enough that it wasn&#39;t out of the realm of possibility. <br />
<br />
Satisfied, she stepped in the bathtub, and took a hot steamy shower. Scrubbed her long, silky, smooth black hair. Rinsed it. With used conditioner, scrubbed her body, then rinsed the conditioner out. <br />
<br />
Finally after about a half hour in the shower, she stepped out and dried herself off. She sighed. There would be no sex tonight. Her husband was out of town on a business trip. She turned out the light, grabbed a dildo, and masturbated herself to sleep.</p>
