<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You suddenly wake up hearing nothing but alarms ringing in your ears. &quot;Hello there.&quot; You heard a voice, and looked up to see an anthropomorphic lizard standing before you. You try to remember your past, but can&#39;t recollect anything,&quot;Who are you?&quot; You growled angerly at the lizard. &quot;My name isn&#39;t important, but you are project Dragon, an experimental soldier with cybernetic capabilities.&quot; The lizard continued. &quot;Project Dragon?&quot; You asked, and looked over to see a robotic claw that was attached to you, and looked behind you to see a robotic wing, and tail. The rest of your body from what you knew them was organic, but you were a dragon, a cyborg dragon. <br />
<br />
&quot;If it helps you were a volunteer for this, there were a few complications with your neural network so you have amnesia for the moment. Your previous name was John, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m authorized to give you.&quot; The lizard said, but suddenly hearing that name triggered memories. You remembered that you were human, and that you were captured prisoner. You then grabbed the lizard, and threw him against a wall knocking him unconscious. You noticed that you had a HUD of sorts, and you used that to access a nearby computer, and you downloaded as many files as you could to your memory before your escape. You went into a full sprint trying to find an exit, but in the end you found yourself bashing through a window, and using your instincts to fly away.<br />
<br />
You hid inside a small cave, and began looking through the files for more information about yourself. You couldn&#39;t find anything except for that there was a tracker attachment on the back of your claw, so you destroyed it and began running again. The one thing you did know was about the war, and you just chose your side. Once you thought you were far enough you stopped, and decided to look through the files, and see what you are capable of. Once you got a decent understanding of your robotic functions, you decided to move to an area where there was a known human base, and try to convince them.<br />
<br />
That was until you saw a human being picked up by an anthro tiger, and found an opening to ally with him. You activated a function to camouflage your body, and moved in to strike. There were two other guards with the tiger, and figured the tiger for the leader. You saw one of the guards trail off, so you used the opening, and stabbed him through the chest. You then stealthy killed the other guard when the tiger took notice to you. &quot;Where are you coward?&quot; The tiger said throwing the man onto the ground, so you decided to make an entrance.<br />
<br />
You disabled your camouflage, and stood before the tiger who was shocked by your appearance and said,&quot;I am designated project dragon by your faction, but I made a choice, and decided against your faction. I must eliminate you now,&quot; you began as your claw began charging up with heat,&quot;goodbye.&quot; You said and fired a shot that penetrated through the tigers chest, and left his corpse burning. You saw the human was still conscious, but wounded in his leg. You walked up to the human, but he trembled, and stumbled backwards in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human, stop moving your wound will worsen, and I need you alive so I can have someone to help me ally with your race.&quot; You said, and the human stopped moving backwards. &quot;What the hell are you?&quot; The human said trembling, and you said,&quot;As I stated before I am designated as project Dragon. I am a cybernetic soldier created by that faction that the tiger was on. The reason I saved you is because that faction tried to brainwash me into thinking that I worked for them. However, I have amnesia, and one of the scientists triggered one of my memories. The memory of my capture, and you should know I was once human like you, in this war.&quot; You explained.<br />
<br />
The human calmed down, and let you closer,&quot;Why should I trust you?&quot; The human asked, and you responded,&quot;Multiple reasons, but the main, and most immediate reason is that I saved your life, and at the rate you&#39;re bleeding you will die in approximately 32 minutes, and 18 seconds. Even less if you move.&quot; You said finding a dead medic, and taking his supplies. You began stitching the humans wound, and the human said,&quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;I told you my designation already, but all I can remember of my name is John.&quot; You explained as you continued stitching.<br />
<br />
You finished stitching, and helped the human up when a dead humans radio began going off. &quot;Squad 6 report.......Squad 6!&quot; A voice came through the radio. You picked it up, and gave it to the human,&quot;You should respond to that.&quot; You said. The human nodded, and began responding,&quot;This is Sergeant Greans reporting in. Everyone in my squad is KIA except me and I am wounded, and I was saved by some sort of anthropomorphic dragon cyborg who wants to ally with us.&quot; Sergeant Greans said, and the man from the other end of the radio said,&quot;I&#39;m sorry can you repeat that?&quot; Sergeant Greans repeated the message shortly after. &quot;Is this being with you now Sergeant? And if it is please hand the radio to it.&quot; The person on the other end asked, and Sergeant Greans responded,&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sergeant Greans handed the radio to you, and you said,&quot;I am designated as project dragon, I want to ally with humanity for personal reasons, and those reasons are that I have vague memories of being captured as human. Everything that Sergeant Greans said is true, and if you still don&#39;t trust me Sergeant Greans can attest to the fact that I killed three anthro animal soldiers, and if that still isn&#39;t enough I have files from the labs from which I woke up in that I can share with you.&quot; You said. There was no noise over the radio for a few moments until a voice came through again,&quot;Project dragon..... I heard rumors, but nothing was confirmed of its existence until now....very well then an extraction team is on route to your position. As for project dragon, we will discuss your alinement after we receive the files you have. For now however I am General Drake of the U.S. Military.&quot; General Drake responded over the radio.</p>
