<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;ll go first&quot;, announced Matt, &quot;but I want to become something cool&quot;. He adds, &quot;And I want to be surprised, don&#39;t tell me, please&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot;, said Jacob, getting to work on programming the Chronivac, luckily it was able to process reference images, so he fed in some promotional material from a computer game series, adding in more information where needed. After a few minutes in which Matt purposefully looked away, Jacob announced, &quot;Ready when you are!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt still stood there naked and rolled his eyes, &quot;Finally! Hit me&quot;.<br />
Jacob started the process, and instantly Matt was engulfed in a bright blue light. What could be seen from outside was that he somewhat grew, first loosing his definition before regaining his solidity. As the light vanished his new form became apparent.<br />
Matt somehow blanked out during the transformation. Now that his systems were booting up Matt realized that his mind was now just a program running on his computer. At first he felt like being in a featureless void, he gradually gained more and more senses as more and more of his subsystems booted up. In what seemed to him like half of an eternity, he gained the ability to hear, use his actuators to allow him to move, his field main of vision was roughly 180° in front of him, but soon he could see in all directions, he could analyze the atmosphere around him and tune into a wide variety of radio signals. Quickly he became overwhelmed by all the subsystems, but he realized he could easily set filters on them, deciding what they should report to him and what not. As all of his systems were booted up he felt the urge to announce it so he said the words that seemed to be most appropriate in this situation, saluting to Jacob: &quot;All systems booted up, sir! This unit is fully functional and ready for duty!&quot; His voice was slightly robotic and distorted.<br />
<br />
Jacob grinned at Matt and ordered &quot;At ease&quot;. With those two words Matt immediately felt different. While before he was mostly occupied with following orders and rules, meticulously checking his systems for the time they would be used, he now was a lot more like a human. His robotic stance became smooth movements. He looked at his armor plated arms, this wasn&#39;t strictly necessary as his mind held all the information there is to know about them, but still looking at them, with their bulky yet agile design ending in powerful yet nimble fingers. His color scheme was mostly a dull green, often broken by black parts that were made out of a different material. His head was a helmet with a sun shade and a golden visor behind of which many of his sensors were. His legs were similarly armored as his arms, as well as his body. He looked like a solid hunk of metal, and probably much of him was.<br />
Looking down between his feet he noticed a round part between his legs. It had a slit in front of it and was painted black. Of course he knew what it was and instructed his actuators to fully extend into a mechanical penis.<br />
&quot;Boah&quot;, Matt exclaimed and Jacob replied, &quot;Yeah, I made you somewhat anatomically correct&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jacob curiously asked Matt, &quot;So how are you? Are you alright? How do you feel?&quot;<br />
Matt replied, &quot;Yeah I think I&#39;m OK, all of my systems are working well withing normal levels. I&#39;d like to try out myself, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d break something here just by standing here&quot;.<br />
Jacob nodded, and ordered &quot;Attention!&quot;<br />
Matt immediately saluted and was in his robotic mode again.<br />
Jacob gave another order, &quot;Bark like a dog!&quot;<br />
Obediently Matt did his best impression of a barking dog his voice synthesizer could muster.<br />
Jacob giggles, and ordered &quot;At ease!&quot;<br />
Matt immediately switched into his more human mode again. &quot;Wow, that was weird&quot;.<br />
Jacob ordered again &quot;Bark like a dog!&quot; to which Matt replied, &quot;Go *beep* yourself!&quot;<br />
Matt found that whenever he wanted to say a profanity it came out censored with a beep, he tried it out by cursing out more and more, but all that came out were a few words connected by long beeps. He found this rather ridiculous and cried out in the best laughter his voice synthesis would allow.<br />
Jacob asked Matt, &quot;How do you think about fulfilling my orders when you were in your duty mode?&quot;<br />
Matt hmmed as he tried to explain, &quot;It felt incredibly right, there is nothing bad or awkward about it. In this mode I would do anything for you!&quot;<br />
Jacob concluded, &quot;Good, now may I see how well your camouflage system works?&quot;<br />
Matt nodded and activated that system and in a moment he became almost fully invisible. Only when he moved there were light distortions in the air, like currents of air in different temperatures making the air flicker.<br />
Jacob said, &quot;Yes that should be fine, we&#39;ll be going on a little walk later where that would be useful&quot;.<br />
Matt deactivated the camouflage system and watched Jacob enter some data on his computer, within a short amount of time he got up and pressed the button to start the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Within seconds he looked just like Matt, a heavily armored machine. The only visible difference was that he was painted in a pale yellow. As he booted up he did not announce his status like Matt, instead he displayed a grinning mouth on his visor addressing Matt, &quot;Hello cutie&quot; before grabbing his bum.<br />
Matt immediately recognized him as having a higher rank and he asked, &quot;So you are now like me?&quot; Jacob said, &quot;Yeah, but I can switch between my modes at will, and you cannot give me commands, unless I want to&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jacob activated his camouflage and provided his position so Matt could follow him outside. There they quickly jogged into a nearby forest where they wouldn&#39;t be found that quickly. They both deactivated their camouflage and Jacob playfully pounced Matt making him slide and dig quite a bit into the ground.</p>
