<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milly banged his head against the table over and over and over. He knew the old saying that harming yourself to make your troubles go away was like the saying about resentment, &#39;drinking poison thinking it&#39;ll harm your enemies.&#39; But for a time, at least it made the headache he felt not feel as bad. <br />
<br />
&quot;STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! HAPPY DEENA YOU ARE STUPID!&quot; He was at the other end of the house. He knew none of it could be undone, and that the best solution was simply to grin and bear it, and make the best of the situation, but that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t have the right to blow off some steam.<br />
<br />
When Milly first heard about these hot spots, he figure it was something like maybe a diner or an old folk&#39;s home or some other obscure place for Happy Deena to practice her magic on... and instead she&#39;d skipped the appetizer and gone for eating three racks of heavily sauced prime ribs in a row!!! <br />
<br />
&quot;AGH! Transforming THAT MANY before transforming the school!? What was she thinking?! Was she thinking?! AGH! What a mess!!!&quot; He banged his head into the table some more. <br />
<br />
All the magical girls gifted with abilities that related to enhanced senses shouldn&#39;t have all been  pairs. While magical twins and triplets were a lot more common than in normal humans, this was crazy how they were not only limited to magical girls whose talents were observation and knowledge but that&#39;s also all they were! <br />
<br />
Happy Deena, reckless flying while she was still learning to crawl had resulted in an absurd number of glitches in the magical girl growth! Happy Deena may have gotten one of her seven generals out of it, which was always a plus, but the rest felt like some greedy child who had eaten the entire birthday cake before the party even started! <br />
<br />
There were COUNTLESS subtypes of magical girls, normally one for every girl imaginable and then some!! But since Deena had gobbled up so many so fast, it had resulted in the diversity of her powers to stagnant! She had effectively sacrificed quality and diversity for quantity! This was VERY VERY VERY VERY NOT A GOOD IDEA! When Happy Deena was still learning to be a leader, she should have started out MUCH smaller! <br />
<br />
Milly knew that fate always had a sick sense of humor to keep things interesting, but this was just too much!!! It was like Happy Deena was bent on being a great artist by throwing cans of paint against a wall, THEN drawing in the sketch! AGH! Well, at least that next one wasn&#39;t another food metaphor! <br />
<br />
Milly knew what had been done couldn&#39;t be undone, those magical girls were here to stay. But three hundred and fifty-four? There should have been over a hundred different magical girl templates born from that many! Not five or seven!!! Agh! THIS WAS WHY THE FIRST MAJOR TRANSFORMATION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SCHOOL! This town wasn&#39;t that big! That was the damn reason the scepter had chosen this no face town to begin with so the bloody NeFiends wouldn&#39;t take notice of them! <br />
<br />
It truly bewildered Milly&#39;s mind that their small town even HAD that stupid mansion to begin with, let alone enough people with enough status or wealth to constitute a part and that much security and staff and guests! Now that Milly had the brains he used to think he had, he realized how utterly and completely insanely TOP HEAVY it all made things!!! Agh!<br />
<br />
Milly knew he really needed to calm down. This wasn&#39;t healthy. But he truly and sincerely felt like pulling his fur out at Deena&#39;s antics! He knew it wasn&#39;t his place to override or contradict her decisions and orders, but every time he thought of the complications and giant mess that had spawned from the mansion that it made banging his head on a table truly seem like a relaxing massage compared to the throbbing headache it gave him!!<br />
<br />
It was his DUTY to memorize every magical girls&#39; name and title and age and basic appearance!!!! But he was still learning the basics of that ability!!!!!! Which meant his headache was going to be MUCH MUCH MUCH WORSE before the day was out! But the worst part, the absolute WORST PART was knowing Happy Deena just didn&#39;t CARE!!! <br />
<br />
All she cared about was her &#39;accomplishment&#39; with the pride of a gluttony bowl champion! She&#39;d tell him to &#39;deal with it&#39; or &#39;whatever&#39; or get angry at him for daring to tell her different! She was to the mother of all of Earth&#39;s Magical Girls, the one true comfort all these MGs would have that no matter how dark things seemed there was one woman who loved them unconditionally and fully. &quot;And she&#39;s a FREAKIN&#39; SPOILED BRAT!&quot; Milly thought ready to rip his own ears off! <br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down Milly... Calm down... don&#39;t give yourself a heart attack... if you can have one of those... So what if she turned the school brat into a humble maid, and overreached her power, HEAVILY DAMAGING the diversity, and therefore survival ability of her daughters... what&#39;s done is done... what&#39;s done is done... It&#39;s not like she&#39;s going to do something, THIS STUPID ever again... right? So what if this might have also damaged her first group of daughter individuality? Your job is to just to advice and provide information, not to claw her in the face and tell her she&#39;s being an idiot for converting that many people at once after only creating me and the twins... Hopefully at the school we don&#39;t get another identical seven-dozen of the same MG types. Just stay calm. Don&#39;t call her a pig. Don&#39;t call her an idiot. Don&#39;t tell her any of these things, it&#39;ll just damage the trust between you two, and that&#39;s the last thing you need. Just stay calm and muddle through.&quot;<br />
<br />
A Maid, 39 Views with 39 Observe Partners, 82 Shields, 70 Lances, 60 Healers, 62 Casters, and one of the generals.<br />
<br />
Never mind he hadn&#39;t expected the first dozen, first 100, first two hundred, first three hundred, first three hundred and fifty-four, TO BE SO BLOODY MONOTONE!!!! HOW COULD SHE BE SO THOUGHTLESS AND SELFISH!? <br />
<br />
Having a large group of same type of magical girl didn&#39;t make their magic stronger, IT MADE IT WEAKER!!! Magical Girls&#39; magic THRIVED on diversity! The only real exception being the twins, triplets, etc. <br />
<br />
Milly couldn&#39;t even BEGIN to comprehend how much Happy Deena had SHOT HERSELF IN THE FOOT WITH THIS ONE!!!<br />
<br />
Ugh! He kept finding something NEW to be angry about with this debacle with each passing minute! There was no way he could have ignored her order to look after the twins while she was gone, but this was bloody why he was SUPPOSED to stay at her side!!!!<br />
<br />
Three hundred and fifty-four... if Pokemon had reached that number with that limited diversity, the franchise would have never made it to that number!!!! <br />
<br />
It was Milly&#39;s GREATEST DESIRE to get Deena to sit in a chair with no snacks, and just SIT THERE as Milly rolled over every possible detail about much she had messed up! But... but... that wouldn&#39;t solve anything, all it would do is get Deena mad at him, and she&#39;d never listen to a thing he&#39;d say again and that would be even worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deena... you are an idiot.&quot; Milly sighed. <br />
<br />
Milly was stunned stupid that two Nefiends had come to this little no face town, away from any major cities, let alone an entire pack of then, let alone a magic hunter. Milly knew conflict was going to be their business, but it felt like fate wanted to rush everything... which wouldn&#39;t be so bad... but the growth of the magical girl army was supposed to be a thing of beauty, something flowering and wonderful... not something just poured over a canvas and called art! And such a crude method of growth so early on had resulted in damage to the whole! If this was when they had a much larger army it wouldn&#39;t have been such a problem, but going from 1 digit to triple digit on what was supposed to be a bloody practice run? Deena had gotten too big for her breeches. <br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, if more Nefiends show up than this place has already had in a years, I am going to KNOW cynics were right all along and fate is a sadistic bully who just likes seeing people squirm. After all, why have anyone practice on HILLS when you can just throw them at a mountain and just hope they don&#39;t go splat! The whole damn point of the school is to PREVENT THAT KIND OF DAMN THING! Too bad no one thought about the Matriarch making those kinda boneheaded moves herself! AGGGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no actual NEED to go over or even look at the other two hotspots, Deena&#39;s antics had done enough for six or eight hotspots at once! That left just the school, that hopefully wouldn&#39;t be as big a mess.<br />
<br />
Now Milly need to process and register the most painfully un-diverse Magical Girl Army IN HISTORY! And all before the school opened. This was not going to be easy or simple. The welcoming of every magical girl into the family was for all the terrible sacrifices it asked for, was supposed to still be a happy occasion. <br />
<br />
Now Milly felt like he was stuck as a desk drone at a drive-through-marriage-office. The MONOTONE of it all, and Happy Deena&#39;s complete lack of empathy for this sacred drudgery that he carried on his shoulders threatened to make his blood boil again. <br />
<br />
The sooner started the sooner done...<br />
<br />
He magically created the template that would handle this monstrous load. Again he silently cursed the Matriarch it was his reason for existing to serve and guide no matter what. <br />

Milly screamed more profanities than there were in the english language. &quot;WHY DID SHE HAVE TO GET SO BLOODY --GREEDY!?-- DOESN&#39;T SHE GIVE A DAMN FOR THE KIND OF WORK THIS MEANS FOR ME?! NO! She doesn&#39;t! She just gobbles it all up and thinks this all just happens on its own!&quot; <br />
<br />
Since due to Happy Deena&#39;s greedy recklessly and totally overblowing what should have been a brief start with getting to use her transformation magic... The various subtypes, of which there should have been hundred in a group this large and instead were only four or five new ones... ugh. Describing the dresses was easy. <br />
<br />
Worse of all, EVEN THE COLORS were all the same! Even if you had two Magical Girls both named Hera Harriott the ends results should have VERY different since every magical girl was born from the heart of the person they once were, even as Matriach, Deena could override this for Magical Girls who were absolutely needed to.... BLOODY PREVENT EXACTLY what she had done! An over abundance of one type of magical girl, five times over! AGGGH!!!<br />

Birth Number:316<br />
Title and Name: Maid Fioara<br />
12 Years Old<br />
Former Self:   <br />
Hair/Eyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
A Maid, 39 Views with 39 Observe Partners, 82 Shields, 70 Lances, 60 Healers, 62 Casters, and one of the generals.<br />
<br />
<br />
The lack of diversity made him sick to his stomach (a part of him was amazed he still had one, he was basically a living terminal anyway). Happy Deena didn&#39;t seem to realize that it didn&#39;t matter if it was flowers, basket weaving, caring for mausoleums, or dinosaurs, almost anything could be the basis for a magical girls&#39; powers. While magical girls power certainly migrated into categories indeed, like those for offense, defense, support, close range fighting, distance fighting, and infinitely more... there was something truly disturbing about all of this many right out of the gate having identical titles. There were only so many words and names in the english language, in any language, repeats were inevitable, but here it felt disturbing! The whole POINT of the Seven Generals and the Matriarch was that they could unite and get the conflicting personalities and powers of the various magical girls to work in harmony on a large scale rather than just squad to squad. There were certainly going to be groups of friends and family who when changed would have unifying themes and styles, but here it felt almost... mechanical. <br />
<br />
You also couldn&#39;t just &#39;fix&#39; a magical girl after they were born, it was like a mundane human trying to change the recipe <i>after</i> they&#39;ve baked the cake. This unbalance mess was stuck the way it was. If Milly had the option, if he didn&#39;t know fate was a brat who never allowed do overs unless it suited it, he&#39;d have them start over after the twins and have Deena do things the right way dammit, but again, he doubted fate was ever going to allow ANYTHING like that. <br />
<br />
The only sane thing to do was put this deformed mishsapened horde in a separate category except for the maid and the general, and start the numbering system from 1 when they started at the school, which Milly could only hope against hope that Happy Deena did as a spiral rather than a gluttonous tidal wave. <br />
<br />
<br />
It... it was too much... it... it nearly killed him... he hadn&#39;t been ready... not so many... so many at once... so many... at once... Oh God. Oh NO! OH NO! OH NO!!!!! OH NO!!!!!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he felt IT!!!!!<br />
<br />
A Nefiend, the size of a office building, with point eyes, a goofy grin on his face, round and fat, bald save for a few stray wild hairs. A big flat tooth sicking out. Aware of his own existence, and with the IQ of a retarded three yar old. Bright brownish red. Speaking in a dull, almost peaceful voice. <br />
<br />
Puckering her lips like he was using a straw, and sucking up the 300+ magical girls look food. Then smiling to himself, patting belly so much he rung like a drum. The entire whole damn reason for the school was to create a safe zone where magical girls couldn&#39;t be sensed and the enemy couldn&#39;t comprehend them being there even if they were looking them in the face with the monsters outside and the magical girls just inside the school grounds. <br />
<br />
But Deena hadn&#39;t done anything like that, she&#39;d take the magical girls from lower single digit rage to 300+ in the space of an afternoon... there wasn&#39;t time for things to adjust, and the school hadn&#39;t even been made. <br />
<br />
All those magical girls were going to die. NO! Milly knew it would kill Deena if that happened!<br />
<br />
Desperate times, desperate measures. <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Milly hacked into the twins&#39; observation program and found the candidate. <br />
<br />
Milly skipped and leapt, and churned on his &#39;don&#39;t question what you&#39;re seeing, just roll with it&#39; aura to absolute maximum... it made his head hurt, and would make his gem shatter if it went on for too long and if that happened... well, he&#39;d be as stupid and mindless as any other mundane animal, it was where the lion&#39;s share of his mind was kept (thankfully it was tough enough normally to within stand a shot with a high caliber bullet at point blank range). <br />
<br />
He practically leapt into a little girls&#39; bedroom where she was busy dressing her dolls. If not for his aura, she&#39;d have done the rational thing and called for her parents, or might be careful of this strange animal that just burst into her bedroom. With now she said. &quot;Hello, would you like to play with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! ... There lots and lots of friends who&#39;d like to play with you! In fact! If they don&#39;t become their friend! They could all get hurt! Would you like to be their friend?!&quot; Milly hated himself so much for this right now. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH! Sure! Okay!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then...&quot; Milly&#39;s crystal glowed brightly. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
<br />
Deena noticed, Milly&#39;s crystal looked... dull, worn, faded, not the bright pink it had been before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, bro&#39; you okay?&quot; Deena asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m just tired bro... I... I had to take care of something important.&quot; Then he said. &quot;And Deena? Please... remember that Fioara is your child now too... not your servant. All she wants is your approval. And she&#39;ll work herself to the bone to get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deena thought about it. &quot;I&#39;ll remember Milly, thanks.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door. <br />
<br />
Deena opened it to find, Shield Alexis, and Gale Force waiting outside, both now in clothes typical for girls their age. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Deena,&quot; Gale Force waved. &quot;Mind if we come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... not at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your cat invited us to come over until the school is up and running.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am honored to be here Matriarch.&quot; Alexis bowed. <br />
<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
The Cleaner Upper, named Yummy by the sentient level NeFiends, looked frustrated and dumbly around. The delicious magical girls he had smelled were all gone... Snorting, he made his Superman pose away and bounced away into the sky to tell his masters that the magical girls he&#39;d sensed had all vanished, and none of them could remembered WHERE they&#39;d sent him to begin with, and he could not recall. <br />
<br />
+++<br />
<br />
There was in town cinder block dry basement. Now the walls were reinforced with magical dampening fields to prevent magical sense from detecting what was inside. Also there were suit cases with even more powerful magical dampening fields to protect what was inside from any Nefiend from sensing them. <br />
<br />
This was a temporarily measure, until the field to protect magical girls had become strong enough to protect them from the NeFiend&#39;s Great Eyes. <br />
<br />
Nine year old Doll-Master Delilah, hummed himself. <br />
<br />
Her parents were still her parents, even if they now perceived her as being a living doll that they loved and respected as their child all the same. Even her classmates wouldn&#39;t give her a second look. <br />
<br />
Her skin was shinny plastic, and her ball joints on her fingers and elbows were all visible and her eyes like glass. <br />
<br />
Strapped to the back of her waist were a pair of puppeteer crosses with the strings wrapped around he waist. <br />
<br />
She wore some pretty red flat tops, and a simple blue dress with a white apron and a simple sparkling red band that match her shows, and some white fingerless gloves. Across her back was a large white bow and a similar one in her brown hair, that matched her brown eyes. <br />
<br />
She now had 351 new little dolls. All asleep dreaming peaceful dreams. All safely in their cabinets in her basement behind several security measures both magical and mundane. The she was certain each one was placed carefully in their spots, they were her big sisters after all. They would sleep for now, until the magical girl army had organically grown large enough for them to turn back into real girls, for now Doll-Master Delilah would watch over them until they were ready. That day wouldn&#39;t be tomorrow, the day after that, or the day after that, or the day after that, but it would come eventually. She&#39;d watch over her family until then.</p>
