<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trent and Frank step back, confused from the lights show that just had flash before both of their eyes. “What the fuck was that!?” screamed Trent as he scrambled to get his shirt off from where the green light hit him. “I don’t know bro, some of that light stuff hit me and I dunno where it went” exclaimed Frank as he did the same. <br />
<br />
Jack, dazed from the green light hitting his face, stumbled to see what Trent and Frank were yelling about, watching them wildly check each other’s chests for signs of the light that had hit them just moments earlier. He stepped forward only to be hit with a sudden pain in his chest. Odd,  he had felt just fine earlier before he read the text. He sat down in the chair next to him, and tried to remember what the inscription was on the mask. <br />
<br />
“Okay, so I think it was something about the Great  Lion, and how we would become true members of its pac…”, Jack suddenly stopping to curl over in pain, as he felt his insides churning from moments before. Trent and Frank, who were checking each other still both came over rushing to Jack to see if he was okay, only to find themselves thrown to the floor in writhing pain. <br />
“What the hell is happening!?” Jack exclaimed. “I don’t know, we need to get out of here!” Trent said through his writhing. <br />
<br />
The doors slammed shut closed, and the light began to dim once more. Frank suddenly stopped rolling around and sat up saying “I don’t feel bad anymore, I wonder what that was”. Suddenly, he felt very flush and horny at the sound Jack was making, which confused him. Frank wasn’t gay. He never really liked men, but something about Jack’s voice started making him feel…weird. He started putting his hand in his shorts to relieve himself from the hornyness put on moments ago, when he felt his soft (?) penis not getting hard. Slowly, he felt his penis getting smaller and started feeling even hornier. He scrambled to get his pants off to see what was happening. <br />
<br />
At the same time, Trent slowly stopped writhing and asked “Frank what are you doing bro!? Get your hands out of your pants!” As he went over to stop Frank, he touched his naked shoulder which sent a spark of electricity through his entire being. He instantly felt as horny as Frank did, and fell back to the floor and grabbed his penis as well, which was also not getting bigger. He furiously was rubbing it, trying to make it get bigger when he also felt it start to shrink.  <br />
<br />
Jack, unaware of what was happening, still writhing in pain heard a slight voice inside of his head…<br />
“YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN AS THE NEW LEADER OF THE PRIDE. GO NOW, AND MAKE THE TEMPLE IN WHICH YOU AND YOUR LIONESSES HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH OCCUPYING”<br />
<br />
“Me and my WHAT!?” As he said out loud and looked up to see Frank and Trent furiously masturbating their shrinking penises away. He thought to himself “if I’m the leader of the pride, then what would that mean for me?”  Not any sooner than he finished his thought, his whole body shook with pleasure and went straight down to his balls. “<br />
<br />
“Oh…oh god”<br />
<br />
His balls, aching with inhuman need and filling with seed, stated growing ever so slightly. He hastily grabbed his dick, to feel it felt different. <br />
He pulled his pants down quickly to reveal his penis was now an inch shorter. He watched as it flushed red with inhuman color, and spikes grew at the end of the now points tip. His balls pulsing now with lion seed as his penis slipped into the new sheath that was forming on his chest. <br />
<br />
Frank and Trent, meanwhile, rubbing their disappearing penises now found their balls to be pulling back up into their bodies. From where they were, and new soft and wet cleft appears where they penis was shrinking into. Lost in lust, they slipped a finger into their newly formed vaginas, as their lust continued to rage on. Stopping for only a quick moment, Trent catches a glimpse at Jack’s changing penis, hungry for its wet supple shaft. <br />
<br />
Jack, moaning in pleasure, takes the new penis in his hand a moves it back and forth along the slick shaft  feeling pleasure that is only growing in intensity. <br />
The voice comes back to him…<br />
<br />
“YOU NOW KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED, SEAL YOUR CHANGES BY MATING WITH YOUR TWO LIONESSES AND MAKE YOUR TEMPLE STRONG” <br />
<br />
Not as soon as the voice went away, Trent had crawled his way to Jack in desperate need begging him “Bro, I don’t know what’s happening, but I need you and I need you now”, and flips over and presents himself to his new leader. <br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Jack unthikedly takes his first new lioness and slips his newly formed penis into the waiting vagina and pushes his newly formed bulge all the way into Trent. From their crotches, fur starts to form and the changes start to come on faster. <br />
<br />
Frank, deep in his new vagina masturbating his manhood away, steps over to Jack’s face and pleases him to help out.<br />
<br />
Jack, bulge deep in Trent, pushes his face deep into Frank’s new parts, and licks incessantly. His face starts to slowly change, as Frank’s nether regions develop fur that extends up to his chest and knees. <br />
<br />
Slowly being taken by their new Lion who is changing rapidly, the lionesses receive pleasure they never thought possible, changing as rapidly as they are.</p>
