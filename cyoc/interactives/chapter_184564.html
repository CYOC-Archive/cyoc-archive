<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ad the morning light shone down onto Mazy&#39;s face, she gave a small sigh, she was happy, happy that ther ladyship, now master and teachers had forgiven her and Rose, she was happy that Lady Willow had welcomed them not just into her room, but into her life, and she was happy feeling the new life currently moving within her.<br />
<br />
Mazy slowly opened her eyes, seeing the face of a Rose, still fast asleep, and Mazy&#39;s arm slowly drifted under the blanket, until her hand rested upon her swolen belly, Mazy let out another sigh, feeling the baby press his foot against her palm, clearly not happy about the feeling if being touched, Mazy gave a chuckle and leaned in to whisper to her belly &quot;Hey in there, I see your not a morning person either hey?, but I bet its nice and warm and comfy in there isn&#39;t it&quot; she giggled as she petted the side of her belly and rolled over so she was on her back, grunting with effort to move the new weight of her womb.<br />
<br />
But then Mazy noticed that something was missing, or rather some ONE was missing, Lady Willow was not in bed with them, and as her maid and as her apprentice, it was Mazys job to go and make sure she was alright, so Mazy heaved herself into a sitting position on the bed, cradling the underside of her swolen underbelly panting with effort and she gave a small chuckle &quot;you know baby, you sure are heavy, and I get the feeling this isn&#39;t going to get any easier&quot; she chuckled as she petted her belly, getting a solid kick in response, after refilling her winded lungs from the babies kick Mazy heaved herself up and began waddling towards the door.<br />
<br />
Ad she aproched the door, Mazy passed a full length mirror, she stopped as she viewed her new form, tuning to the side to get a better look at her new look, her burned night gown had been removed, replaced by what looked like silver strings around her body, hugging her new curves and barely covering her more....sensitive areas, she had a low hanging necklace around her neck, with silver strings coming off it and draping over her breasts, the string were thin and hardly covered her now darkened nipples, her erect teats clearly visible as they protruded through the gaps in the strings, she wore nothing around her midsection, but then again there probably wasn&#39;t anything that could FIT around her now swolen womb, her snowy skin and magic circle on full display, and then there was her skirt, or lack there of.<br />
<br />
As her body had grown and adapted to the sudden pregnancy, her clothing had to adapt with her, her new dress was a simple belt that hugged around her new cushions of her ass and the underside of her belly, her hips had widened along with her thighs becoming more voluminous and jucy, not in a fattening way however, but it had left the option of a full skirt out of the question, so she now wore a long floor length silver collection of silver strings at the front and back of the belt, barely covering her ass and pussy, but for some reason she didn&#39;t mind, she was comfortable, and that was that.<br />
<br />
Mazys gaze then once again fell upon the reflection of her belly, watching in fascination as the shape of the baby foot brushed across her stretched skin before disappearing once again, Mazy gave a smile and gently began stroking her baby, going rom her belly&#39;s peak, all the way to its sensetive underside, humming a made up lullaby to the baby she now carried &quot;ok little one...let&#39;s go find your mommy shall we?&quot; She said and waddled out the bedroom doors.<br />
<br />
As Mazy waddled down the corridors towards Lady Willow&#39;s training room, she couldn&#39;t help but blush as some of the other staff passed her in her new form and outfit, one woman ever brushed her belly with her hand and gave her ass a quick squeeze as she whent past, Mazy let out a small squeak in surprise from this new sensation as she spun around to confront the woman, only to find that it was Rose.<br />
<br />
&quot;God&#39;s above my love, don&#39;t startle me like that nnnnggghh, it sets the baby off apparently&quot; groaned Mazy as she petted her belly to calm the baby as he kicked and punched, Rise gave a small smile and cradled her pregnant belly &quot;sorry my love, but with a body like we have now...I just don&#39;t know how I will ever keep my hands off of you&quot; she smiled, as Mazy looked up she saw that Rose was completely naked!, but then again, being as her mother was an elf she couldn&#39;t really complain, after all, elfs were known to lack a sense of modesty, walking around their treetop villages with nothing on was just a part of their culture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohhhhh, ok baby, its ok now&quot; cooed Mazy as she straightened back up, her hand bracing against her back as she stuck her belly our further, trying to relive some of the pressure the baby was now putting on her sealed cervix, Mazy then let out a moan as the baby once again began to roll over, his head no longer resting in her hips and was now firmly pressing against the top of her belly, the bulge of his head clearly seen in Mazys skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Mazy, don&#39;t want to be late for our mistress on the first day do we?&quot; Giggled Rose as she waddled down the corridor, her ass swaying as she walked, before she turned her head, smirking with a blush, as she grabbed both of her ass cheeks and gave them a good squeeze, before turning to enter the training room, Mazy rolled her eyes and rested her hand gently against the bulge of the babies head &quot;Hey baby?, please don&#39;t take after Rose while your in there, the last thing I need is two trouble makers on my hands ok?&quot; She asked with a giggle before she too waddled into Lady Willow&#39;s training room.<br />
<br />
As they entered they could barely see due to how dark it was, the only light source was a bunch of fireflies hovering around Lady Willow, she sat cross leged in a large red circle, with roots of green glowing light pulsing through the ground towards her, Mazy and Rose watched in fascination  as ther Mistress them began to hover, before her hands shot up, and fire sprung from the ground completely encircling her, Mazy and Rose were about to call for help, but then they herd Lady Willow&#39;s voice, it echoed through the vast room, but it was definitely her.<br />
<br />
&quot;FIRE, one of the first primal sources to spring from the void, a being of strength, life...and destruction, able to take on many forms&quot; said Willow as the flames spiraled upward into a phoenix, and send it circling around the room, lighting the torches and braziers around the room with blue flames &quot;to wield such a being is to both fear and respect its strength, and to know that trying to fully control it is simply impossible, today we will se how strong your will truly is&quot; se said as the phoenix spread out its wings, fire spread out like feathers and it barreled out the far end of the room and out a large window.<br />
<br />
Mazy and Rose were in awe of their ladyship, she was truly worthy of being a high council member, and their ruler &quot;come my apprentices, let is see if I chose correctly&quot; said Willow with a smile as Mazy and Rose waddled towards her, Willow had woken up early this morning, expecting to be greeted by her son&#39;s cries for his morning feed, as he had for the past week, but then room had been silent, and the memories of the night before came flooding back, looking either side if her, Willow saw the two women who now carried her son, their pregnant bellies pressed firmly against her, Willow old never admit this but she had let a tear slip from her eye, the sudden feeling of loneliness becoming all too real, so she had gotten up to head into the training room, she had an idea but it would take time, and alot of patience to pull a spell like this off.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lady, you seem lost in thought...is all well?&quot; Asked Mazy as she approached her, Willow just smiled and waved it off &quot;not to worry Mazy I&#39;m perfectly fine&quot; she said with a smile, but as Mazy waddled to her place to begin the lesson, Willow placed her hand over her belly, feeling four small heartbeats from within &quot;were ok, we all are&quot; she whispered as she gave her lower belly a quick pet, felling its sudden firmness, and then began the lesson....</p>
