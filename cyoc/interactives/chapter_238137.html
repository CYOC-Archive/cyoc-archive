<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diane pulled back, her jaw popping slightly as she pried herself off of Kevin&#39;s massive knot -- smiling as she heard him groan at the pleasant feeling of her teeth scraping over the flexible metal bulb. She gave the mighty, exotic phallus a last appreciative lick as it slid out of her mouth, leaning back to bask in the warmth now pulsing through her. She rested one hand on the floor, the other slipping into her soaked panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhh gooood Lianne that was... oh... oh no...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s words came to her distantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm... ohhhhh --&quot;<br />
<br />
She was just enraptured to reassure him, could only breathe and sigh deeply as her bust expanded, snapping her D-cup bra as if it weren&#39;t there. Her hair grew longer, straighter, spread in a deep red pool behind her. Her skin took on a soft golden tan, the slight hints of age that she couldn&#39;t hide disappeared in a natural, eternal youth.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s stammering apology trailed off, and he gawked at her breasts becoming the size of beach-balls. The deep, spellbinding cleavage as they pressed together in supernatural perkiness, their enormous globes so smooth and golden, still flecked with red freckles; her areolae becoming a darker red-gold as her nipples grew fat and began to leak sweet-scented milk.<br />
<br />
The man could only grab his cock -- still erect and hard as the platinum it was -- and stroke in awe. Seeing Kevin&#39;s reaction, Diane&#39;s smile grew as her lips became even more full and absorbed her lipstick into a natural ruby red. And she let her eyes close in bliss, feeling her extensions become natural eyelashes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh yeeeees...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her swelling thighs and ass snapped effortlessly through her pants and panties, exposing her fingers diving into her flowing snatch. Her nether lips flushed a deep, lascivious red, growing fatter and wetter than ever, and they felt so exquisite to touch. Her clit was throbbing... mmm not just that, it was <i>growing</i>, her ducts shifting with it, until with a twitch its first dewy bead of precum slid shyly out if its freshly opened slit.<br />
<br />
With a happy gasp Diane switched from jilling herself to playing with her engorging clit, groaning deeply as it gained length and girth, turning into a cock of her own. She sank fully back onto the floor, her free hand sliding up and over one of her mountainous tits. Squirming on the plush carpet in ecstasy, her body radiating divine light and power as it grew taller, fitter, to better support her glorious rack and offset her now-waspish hips. Between them her belly grew firm and a four-pack emerged.<br />
<br />
Squeezing her surprisingly firm, gravity-defiant breast, she gasped as a stream of milk fountained up and splashed down on her. &quot;Oh my Goddess <i>yes!</i>&quot; Her hips began to buck as her hand closed in on her cock, though it soon pushed through, lubed by thick pre, and revealing the delicate red skin and pointed, tapered shaft of a canid. She other hand slid around her bust, slicking herself with her milk, then moving past her pumping fist to please her demanding snatch.<br />
<br />
She could feel the power, the strength, the muscles in her legs bulking up even as more shapely fat covered them. Below her knees, silky white fur spread down, her stockings and shoes shredding as her feet stretched into graceful yet powerful paws tipped with red-lacquered claws. Her forearms and hands followed suit, soft white pads appearing on her paws and fingertips as her nails grew sharp and narrow, well-manicured and retracted.<br />
<br />
She could feel the sexual power as her testes formed behind her labia, her clitoral hood molding into a fat sheath for her cock and her own mighty, sensitive knot swelling from the base. Powerful new hormones pumping through her, fueling her libido and mixing into an impossible cocktail as she became a lusty hermaphrodite; a goddess. A living green jewel formed in the centre of her forehead, shining as a beacon of her supernatural vitality and virile femininity.<br />
<br />
At the same time her ears shifted up higher, becoming white-furred triangles tipped in red. Above the fat cushions of her butt as she ground it on the carpet, a nub formed, and split; and one tail after another fluffed forth until there were nine. Each gorgeously lush and luxuriantly white, and tipped with a large red tag; each visibly shining with currents of power. And from her shoulders a pair of feathered wings stretched forth across the floor, white at the top, then shading to pink towards the bottom, to a fringe of red.<br />
<br />
And so she hit her peak, releasing a cry of heart-breaking beauty as she experienced the first of her dual orgasms, pure pearly seed shooting form her nine-inch vixen cock to hit the ceiling, her pussy clamping down and rolling over her deep-buried fingers.<br />
<br />
The living jewel flashed. With the pleasure of climax came knowledge; the instincts of a goddess, the ability of a ruler, the carnality and creativity of a vixen; a flood that mixed with her existing confidence and sensuality as a proud, successful prostitute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh... ohhh... oh Goddess... that was... beautiful...&quot;<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes, now a brilliant emerald like the gem in her forehead and deep with supernal wisdom. New fangs flashed as she smiled up at the awestruck Kevin, his mouth hanging open, his mind lost between lust and wonder.<br />
<br />
Moved by impulse, she floated upright -- not standing, but literally levitating; hovering a few inches off the floor and breathing deeply in the afterglow of her self-love and her apotheosis. Holding up her arms beside her outstretched wings, the rags below her began to swirled up, reforming into her beloved lacy red lingerie, but now suited for her magnificent new curves, fat sheath and towering stature -- for she was now 6&#39;7&quot; (not even counting the ears), a good foot taller than Diane had been.<br />
<br />
Her tattered slacks turned from black to white, raveling up into a silken gown, blackless, sleeveless, a deep V in the front to frame her glorious cleavage and slit from her calves to show off her luscious legs; and just diaphanous enough to show a shadow of her lingerie and the treasures it hid. Her heels became paw-sandals, cradling her white feet in precious red leather edged with gilt.<br />
<br />
Gold armlets with platinum inlay appeared on her wrists; and a silver torc chased with gold clasp her neck. Lastly, a slender fillet of twisted gold and platinum encircled her brows.<br />
<br />
<i>BEHOLD THE GOD-QUEEN!</i> They both started as the voice boomed in their heads. <i>ALL HAIL ZELUBRIA, GOD-QUEEN OF CARAMELLYN!</i><br />
<br />
Kevin collapsed back on the couch, his own clawed hands flopped to his sides. Leaving his cock to spasm by itself as he gaped at the deity floating about him. Slowly the light around her dimmed, though it did not vanish entirely, making it seem as if a spotlight was shing on her. Zelubria descended to the floor, and with a few swishes her nine tails fused into one marvelously poofy brush, and she folded her wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zelubria,&quot; she said, feeling out her new name. A name she knew as hers, even before the voice announced it. She smiled down at the thunderstruck man, putting one hand on a matronly hip, and sliding the other under a boob, enjoying the heft and jiggle of it as much as the hypnotic fixation of Kevin&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my beloved Gateway,&quot; she purred, her voice recognizable yet with a new musicle timbre that melted the heart with adoration and desire to obey. &quot;What do you think of your new divine sovereign? For I know now...&quot; she shifted on her hips, letting her body mesmerise the partially transformed man as she extended a hand, admiring the light flashing off the armlet. &quot;That this city will become Caramellyn, and I... I <i>am</i> its God-Queen.&quot;</p>
