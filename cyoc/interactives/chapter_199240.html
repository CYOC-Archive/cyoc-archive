<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Landing with a soft thud and a grunt from Jackson, the two lovebirds quickly began to make out, their lips locked as they began to explore the bodies they knew so well. Jennifer&#39;s soft face rubbing against Jackson&#39;s rough stubble, the sensation not entirely pleasant for her. <br />
<br />
Jen was the first to make the first real move, lifting off her boyfriend and beginning to unbutton his white T-shirt. <br />
<br />
However, Jen was quickly becoming distracted. First off her scalp was beginning to itch and there was a tickling sensation about her ears and neck as her blonde locks kept rubbing against them. It almost felt as if her hair was alive, rustling around with a mind of its own. In reality it was growing thicker and longer, down past her shoulders to rest along her bustline. <br />
<br />
She brushed the feeling off, not noticing the increased length. It was nothing really major, just a distraction that belonged at the back of her mind she thought as she slowly unbuttoned her boyfriend&#39;s jeans. Shortly after that, Jackson&#39;s pants laid discarded on the far wall his boxers quick to join them. Jackson&#39;s trusty lance poked skyward, ready to do its job.<br />
<br />
Her hair troubles were forgotten as Jackson reached up and began fondling her breasts through her top. Her nipples poked lewdly against the material, and he occasionally gave them a soft flick or pinch. Jennifer moaned at the sensations, quietly wishing that his hands were softer and daintier.<br />
<br />
She threw her head back, sensually running her hands up the sides of her face and through her elongated tresses. Almost unconsciously, she pulled some of her hair into two distinct bunches, giving each a slight tug and relishing the sensation that followed. She released the hair but it stayed exactly where it was, now in two high pigtails secured near her scalp by a pair of green and yellow bows. The rest of her hair flowed loosely, framing her face sweetly. <br />
<br />
She bit the tip of her thumb slightly as she looked down at her boyfriend. Her blue eyes shimmered, looking somehow bigger than normal.<br />
<br />
He smiled up at her, his eyes ignorant to the new hairstyle or the bows that had come from nowhere. He reached up and pulled her down into another kiss, and Jen was quite happy to have a boyfriend with such a serious dedication to shaving. His smooth skin rubbed against her lips and she shuddered at the sensation.<br />
<br />
This shuddering allowed Jennifer&#39;s brain to momentarily notice something else that seemed not right. Again it was nothing major, just something that nipped at her mind. Her clothing rustled in a way that it hadn&#39;t been doing when she put it on. <br />
<br />
Jackson&#39;s eyes were closed, his head pressed into the ground as she got back at him by rubbing his own sensitive nipples, increasingly higher moans coming from his throat. Seeing an opportunity Jen took a quick glance at her outfit.<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed wrong to her eyes, not at all taking in her sleeves becoming skintight as they slid down her arms. The extending fabric seemed to be stealing material from her midriff, as the shirt&#39;s hem pulled out of her short, green and yellow pleated skirt&#39;s waistband. The hem of her shirt stopped above her navel as the spandex texture overtook the whole garment, pulling tight against her torso.<br />
<br />
The school&#39;s name slowly morphed into the word &quot;MONSTER&quot; and her rock hard nipples still poked out insistently against the new material.<br />
<br />
Still seeing nothing odd, she cursed her easily distracted mind, redoubling her efforts on her sexy gir...boyfriend.<br />
<br />
However, a third and final thing interrupted her thoughts. Something that was increasingly taking up her thoughts were her infernal feet. They ached in a way that she couldn&#39;t easily describe, but she didn&#39;t know why. Each sexy thought, every kiss on Jack&#39;s pert lips, created a sympathetic ache in her soles and toes, making her flex her feet and calves involuntarily.<br />
<br />
She tried to ignore the feelings, but they were becoming more and more dominant in her mind every time her soles rubbed against the inside of her cheer shoes. Eventually she could focus no longer, she needed at her feet.<br />
<br />
Pulling herself away from Jack, who pouted in annoyance. Jen sat on the bathroom floor and glared at her encased feet, not caring or noticing as a one and a half inch white platform inflated into being on the soles. She needed to get them out of her shoes, to let them be free in the room&#39;s air, to rub them, to share them with her lover.<br />
<br />
Desperately she rubbed her feet and legs together, trying in vain to scrape away the shoes. All this did was increase her pleasure as her striped socks slid up her thighs to take up the space her shortening skirt had vacated. She whimpered in need, her mind to scattered to remember to untie the shoes and take them off.<br />
<br />
But her salvation soon came. Grasping Jen&#39;s right foot, Jack smiled as they quickly removed their girlfriend&#39;s shoe. They then took off Jen&#39;s other shoe freeing her feet from the captivity that she felt would drive her mad.<br />
<br />
However, as Jack looked up, their softening face grew scared. &quot;Je... Je... Jenny, are you feeling alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh me feeling super good babe,&quot; said Jenny as her feet rolled over one another. She leaned forward and began rubbing at her soles and sniffing the air around them, a satisfied rumbling coming from her throat as she did so. She clenched her toes against her palms, relishing the feeling as they stretched out slightly larger against the fabric of her socks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmmm...feeeet&quot; she mewled to no one in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? Because you keep rubbing your feet, and growling...&quot; said Jack as they began to scoot away, their member still long and ready. Neither noticed as the tips of Jenny&#39;s ears began to poke out from her wild blonde mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmphh, why you bring that up?&quot; Jenny growled at him, a strange glint in her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;It get in way of fun!&quot; continued the girl as her socked soles rushed forward and locked themselves around Jack&#39;s member, making him start with a jolt of sheer pleasure.</p>
