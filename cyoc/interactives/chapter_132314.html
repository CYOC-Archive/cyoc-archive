<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake isn&#39;t your average male, he has long spiky black hair and a well rounded body, his family is also a busy one, most of the time he is home alone, he barelly gets to see them.<br />
<br />
He studies in a rich college in the hopes that he could become one day an engineer, just like his uncle.<br />
<br />
Today he just got the summer holiday and he already made a ton of plans for it.<br />
<br />
He opened the door of his house and threw his backpack on the couch, &quot;Finally home.&quot; he said as he slowly turned the A/C on, he quickly went to his bedroom and searched around the drawer, he quickly grabbed a red shirt and a pair of shorts, he slowly went to the kitchen and opened the fridge, he grabbed some of the left over food, he then slowly ate it.<br />
<br />
Shortly after finishing and washing the plate, he grabbed his phone,keys and a bottle of water.<br />
<br />
He slowly opened the door and went outside, feeling the hot rays of sunlight touching his skin, &quot;This is gonna be a good day.&quot; he said with a smile, he then slowly went to the forest near his home.<br />
<br />
Jake walked for minutes around the forest, he saw the beautiful trees around him, he looked at the  at the azure sky and the fluffy clouds, he even saw birds flying around and chirping, &quot;Wish i was just as free as them.&quot; said Jack as he continued walking deeper into the forest.<br />
<br />
He stumbled upon a waterfall, he decided to take a small break from walking, he opened his bottle of water and started drinking from it, he then laid down on the grass and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
After a few hours have passed, Jake woke up, &quot;Man that was a good nap.&quot; he said as he slowly stretched, he looked around and noticed another pathway was open, &quot;Huuh? I didn&#39;t remember seeing another path here.&quot; said Jake, at first he was hesitant to follow it but then he decided to follow it.<br />
<br />
He walked for minutes, he looked at the sky and saw that it was almost night time, he kept walking untill he saw what looked like some sort of dead area, the grass was just ash meanwhile the trees were dead, with no leaves on them, in the middle of the dead area there was a pedestal with a small feather ontop of it.<br />
<br />
Jake slowly went towards the pedestal and inspected the feather, it was red with small tints of green and blue, &quot;Interesting...&quot; said Jake, he slowly tried to touch it, but the feather seemed to come alive, it slowly started levitating and then setted Jake on fire!<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK?!&quot; Shouted Jake, the fire kept burning untill it extinguished all of a sudden, he realized that he was naked and that all of his hair disapeared, he looked around blushing, he looked up and saw that it suddenly became night time, the moon was full and shining on his skin.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t switch his view to anything else, he stared at the moon, untill a harsh headache interupted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hngg... My head....&quot; He gasped, as he placed his right on his forehead, he didn&#39;t realize that his other hand&#39;s nails were growing into sharp white claws, eventually he felt a tingling sensation coming from his left hand, he looked and saw the claws, &quot;W-What?!&quot; he shouted, &quot;A-Am i hallucinating?&quot; he asked, he slowly touched the claws with his right hand, they were indeed real! He saw dark blue scales forming around his hand, only to then feel like he was stinged multiple times by a syringe, he looked and saw orange feathers slowly covering his arms, &quot;W-What is happening to me?!&quot; he shouted, he saw that the feathers grew more and more, completly covering his left hand with orange feathers that seemed to glimmer, it almost resembled a wing!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile his other hand suffered the same metamorphosis, he felt his bones crack and muscles growing to suit his new wings, the feathers slowly traved down to his armpit, this time the feathers were yellow, with small tints of green and blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaah... So hot... I must...&quot; He panted as he slowly looked at his untouched member, he slowly wrapped his scaly hand around his member, a small moan escaping his lips as he felt the cold avian scales stroke his flesh, he giggled a little as he felt the feathers storking his testicles, he felt a tingling sensation coming from his toe nails, he watched as they turned into white avian claws, he felt his toes fusing together, leaving only three frontal talons and a new talon forming behind his feet, resembling the talons of an eagle, he felt the same dark blue scales cover his feet, only to feel the same orange feathers travel up to his legs, feeling the bones and muscles reshaping to support his changing form.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Aah~!&quot; He moaned, he stroked himself harder untill he felt his member felt like it was being pulled back into his body, he looked at it and saw that it became noticeably smaller, &quot;N-No... Don&#39;t tell me i&#39;m...&quot; his fears slowly grew more and more untill his male member completly disapeared, leaving a small feminine slit, Jake broke down in tears, &quot;I-I don&#39;t want to be a girl! I d-don&#39;t want to be a female bird thing!&quot; he cried.<br />
<br />
He or rather She felt even more aroused, she felt hot... And horny, she slowly shoved one of her talons deep in her slit, &quot;Aaah... So sensitive!&quot; she chirped, as she felt the changes accelerating, she felt a powerful wave of pain resonating from her tailbone, she looked behind her and saw six large feathers growing, with red circles at the tips, she felt the changes reaching her chest, she felt her muscles and bones cracking again, she noticed that she had now an hourglass shape, she slowly started panting more as she felt her lungs becoming more suited for her aerodynamic form, &quot;M-Mrawwk~!&quot; she chirped as she looked at her chest, she felt a pair of breasts growing, only to then be covered with light orange scales resembling a colar, she felt the feathers slowly cover her back slowly reaching her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Almost there...&quot; She moaned with a new feminine voice, she closed her eyes tightly as she felt her ears melting into her head, orange feathers slowly reached her head, meanwhile some of them were longer, resembling hair, she felt her mouth and nose fusing together as it grew into a light orange beak with small nostrils, she opened her eyes, revealing beautiful green eyes.<br />
<br />
She let out a loud chirp as some of her feathers caught fire, it didn&#39;t burn, it actually felt really good, she felt her juices dripping from her scaly hand, she quickly retreated her hand, she looked at her new wings and form, &quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot; she said as she started flapping her wings and took flight, she flew around the night sky in her new form, she saw a small body of water nearby and landed near it, she looked at her reflection, she looked beautiful, even as an avian, &quot;Wait a second... Fire that dosen&#39;t hurt, bright orange feathers... Did i just turn into some form of WerePhoenix?&quot; she asked, as she inspected her new beautiful body, she giggled a little.<br />
<br />
She then....</p>
