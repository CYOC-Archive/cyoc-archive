<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the noon, Riley took Nick to a walk through the rainforest. Although, he tried to resist it, Nick surrendered to his impulse to climb trees and swing between vines. Riley was surprised of how natural his friend moved there like if he was doing it all his life. Even some people drew near and took photos and videos of Nick swinging in the heights.<br />
<br />
At the evening, Riley had lost sight of Nick and he was looking for him. After a moment he found him crouched behind a tree. As he got closer to him he was disgusted of realizing that his friend was shitting. Coincidentally, the candy effect faded at that moment and when Nick realized that his friend was seeing him he yelled at him to go away. He was so ashamed that he tried to stand up but his body was still changing and he fell on four, exposing his shitted hairy ass to Riley. He wanted to cry of shame.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, dude.&quot; Riley told him as he tried to look away. &quot;There&#39;s a lake over there. Clean yourself and we can go back to our room.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ooh-ok&quot; Nick replied in simian way cause his voice was still returning to normal.<br />
They went to the lake and looked some people there swimming and fishing. Nick was so ashamed of being seen with his ass covered in shit that he hid behind a tree.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want be seen... poop.&quot; Nick managed to say to his friend.<br />
&quot;We can wait until people are gone but it could take awhile.&quot; Riley said. &quot;Or you can take this.&quot; He opened his hand and offered a candy to Nick. &quot;This will turn you into a dog. No one will be bothered of seeing a shitted dog.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want be dog!&quot; Nick yelled.<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not forcing you.&quot; Riley said. &quot;Look, I have another candy for me. We can be dogs together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley swallowed the candy and quickly began to shrink inside his clothing until he was practically gone. A moment later, from the pile of clothes emerged a beagle puppy who happily began to bark to Nick.<br />
He grabbed the cute puppy in his arms and petted him, wondering that this tiny animal is in fact his friend.<br />
Riley was licking Nick arm when he realized that he was still shitted. So, he put his friend on the ground and wondered if he should turn into a dog too.<br />
Before regretting it, he took the candy in pile of clothes and swallowed it. Cause he was naked, he was able to see his transformation.<br />
His arms and legs quickly shrunk and took dog shape making him fall on four. His fingers and toes followed until they were practically gone and Nick was sporting paws.<br />
Next, his torso reshaped so he can&#39;t stand up again as his spine changed and extended. A hairless tail grew above his shitted ass which was changing too into a dog&#39;s one. Immediately after, black and brown fur began to spread everywhere and when they reached his balls, he felt an itch that he knew it means they were changing too.<br />
His endowment was quickly covered in hair and it created a sheath for Nick&#39;s fascination and disgust. He hadn&#39;t noticed it until now but his big penis was rock hard since the beginning and now it was the last of his humanity to go. He unexpectedly shot his load, emptying his balls to give space for dog sperm to fill it. He wondered if Riley passed through a similar process but he understood that his friend was a puppy and he was turning into an adult dog.<br />
When his balls were full of dog seed, his human penis began his changing. The pink skin got an intense red color and it reshaped to look like a rocket. It was too orgasmic that Nick had to shoot once again, but this time he released dog sperm instead of human. He looked disgusted at the puddle between between his paws but it emanated an interesting smell that he felt an impulse to sniff it. As he did that, his nose turned black and elongated into a muzzle. Fur grew along with it and his teeth reshaped inside his mouth. His eyes changed and his ears pointed up until he looked like a regular adult german shepard.<br />
Finally, he opened his mouth as he approached it to the cum. His still human tongue was elongating and thinning as it was closer to the puddle until he managed to give a big long lick of it covering all his tongue with his seed. A second later, he realized what he did and began to cough disgusted. He quickly ran to the lake and jumped in.<br />
<br />
Riley saw the dog that was his friend swimming in the lake and joined him, so the people can see a beagle puppy and an adult German Shepard playing in the water.</p>
