<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Regarding the chapter title, I&#39;m regarding  NickKaiba&#39;s chapter on the father&#39;s idea as &quot;part two&quot; since it is also dealing with the music issue. Hopefully this doesn&#39;t confuse anyone...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You wrote music?&quot; Luna spoke with some surprise evident in her voice as she looked over from you to your father.<br />
<br />
To a degree you were surprised too, as you&#39;d never known your father to be all that musically inclined. He worked at the local bank and put a lot of his focus into that and really didn&#39;t talk a lot about his hobbies with you. Of course, he might have shared that with both your biological mother and your stepmother as they were closer to him given their marital relations with him, but even they never said anything about that sort of thing. You privately guessed that a lot of that was more that neither you nor your father had any close hobbies. He liked football, and while you might watch a game when it was on, you had no great interest in it. You liked fantasy stories and video games, and your father accepted that but didn&#39;t share the interest. And a lot of times when he wanted you to do something, he had often been laser focused on that and thus there wasn&#39;t much room for anything more than getting to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing super serious,&quot; your dad gave a weak shrug, &quot;and a lot of it was just a hobby. I grew up listening to a lot of country music, and I liked the folksy and soft tone to it... and particularly some of the more patriotic pieces that they had while rock music seems more intent on protesting everything... and well, it built up as a sort of hobby. I read some books on composition and hummed along things I felt would sound good, though, your grandfather, Nickie, was even more of a hard ass on me than I ever was on you. Thus while I might get some time to write out some short bits in my free time... it was never going to be given time to get picked up or presented to anyone. As your grandfather didn&#39;t think that that sort of career would lead to much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn&#39;t try to pick it up again after you grew up?&quot; you asked your father, looking to sate some of your own curiosity and noting that Kellie and Roxie also looked a bit curious as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;By that time,&quot; your father said slowly and scratched the back of his head, &quot;by that time, I&#39;d built up enough college debt and didn&#39;t know anyone that would want to take a shot at someone outside the &quot;industry.&quot; And keep in mind that I never said anything that I wrote as a kid would be good or anything like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if no one ever played what you wrote, you can&#39;t say it was bad,&quot; Luna countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... but a few short bars for a country tune probably would only end up as elevator jingle music,&quot; you dad replied, &quot;I could try something short and sweet for the wedding... and I got a buddy  that&#39;s played guitar at the bar from time to time. It&#39;d short, simple, and if you&#39;re wanting to wait for a bit, it wouldn&#39;t be bad for a short processional. From there, you two could just mix and match the songs you like for the reception.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a moment as you returned your look to Luna. To a degree, the level of your father&#39;s interest in planning the wedding was still surprising, as since Luna had turned you into a MILF-wolf after her transformation the coming wedding would be a same sex wedding and something that you knew your father generally looked down on. But you figured that a lot of that was merely that he would draw a certain line when it came to family, as you knew that he&#39;d had his opinions that were generally anti-gay, anti-transgender, and so on, but when he&#39;d realized who you were the other night after becoming a MILF-wolf it was like those old opinions weren&#39;t the driving force in his opinions. The fact that the Catholic Church had also issued rulings that would define any man that became a MILF-wolf and then wanted to marry the one that turned them as a &quot;man&quot; was probably part of what your father likely accepted in the marriage. Despite now looking a lot like your biological mother with wider hips, a bigger bust, and bigger feet, your father would still see you as a &quot;son&quot; after a fashion and that then helped him accept things. You supposed that acceptance was probably worth it, and probably wasn&#39;t too different from the fact that Luna had, since you learned on the exact nature of her relationship to Roxie, called Roxie &quot;dad&quot; from time to time.<br />
<br />
That acceptance had also made things fairly calm and free of any real trouble, which was a good thing given that the four of you were seated in Kellie and Roxie&#39;s kitchen. Luna&#39;s parents probably wouldn&#39;t react well if your father went off on something. His staying on topic was good and reassuring and even brought out some surprises. You&#39;d never known him to be musical and the backstory on how your paternal grandfather had restricted things there for your father growing up was equally a surprise. The small and polite smile on Luna&#39;s lips actually seemed to indicate that she didn&#39;t mind the offer and was enjoying some of these surprises as well, which was a good thing. Though after a few moments, the silence was broken by Roxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;A guy know from a bar?&quot; Roxie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn&#39;t a patron,&quot; your father answered, &quot;he actually employed by the bar to play some background music. I talked with him from time to time, and it seems like he&#39;s mostly there for &quot;ambiance&quot; and avoiding something where someone may not like a specific band are artist. So, I&#39;m sure he can play well... and for Nick... err... Nickie, I&#39;d pay him to play for the wedding. I&#39;d just need to get the timing for everything so that I can get the piece written and give the guy time to practice it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that sounds good,&quot; you commented, &quot;though if we&#39;re to do that, we may need to hear him play before any decision on hiring him is made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could work a bit with how we are now,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;after all... both of us look older than we are now. We could scout your guitar man without any trouble. And if he&#39;s there to provide music that won&#39;t irritate people, I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t mind having a couple of women come in for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bars would still ID you,&quot; Kellie warned, &quot;and while identification as a MILF-wolf would confirm who you and that physically you&#39;d have traits of someone older than twenty one... by law you&#39;re only eighteen and thus can&#39;t drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And some bars may not even allow you entrance while under twenty one,&quot; Roxie added.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bar might let them in with escort, but wouldn&#39;t serve them anything but soda or water,&quot; your father assured Luna&#39;s parents, &quot;the only real worry might be someone hitting on them, as not all the guys that go there are married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d imagine that&#39;d go away when they learn we&#39;re MILF-wolves,&quot; Luna answered calmly, &quot;and this would only be to scout this guitarist friend of yours. If he turns out well... he could well be worth it, assuming he wouldn&#39;t mind playing for a marriage between two women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get the sense that he won&#39;t mind so long as he gets paid,&quot; your father answered, &quot;and I&#39;d pay for him... if only to make Nickie happy. I may have my opinions, and many of them won&#39;t change, but family always comes first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad,&quot; you managed as that line did reflect heavily on the more pleasant surprises that had come around with your father since becoming a MILF-wolf.<br />
<br />
He nodded, &quot;that is... if you&#39;d be okay with a rough first shot at a short piece of music.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and glanced back to Luna, as the final choice was to go to her. You&#39;d go with anything she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would mean a lot if you would write a song for the wedding,&quot; Luna commented, &quot;something short and sweet that I can walk to at the wedding and something romantic. Not some kind of pep song, pop song, country, rock, or rap... something that would be sweet and touching.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked back to see a small smile form on your father&#39;s lips, &quot;thank you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the father of my mate and future wife,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;and the grandfather of our daughter. That would make you family too. Thus if family comes first, it might be best to give you a shot.&quot;</p>
