<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jazzy!&quot; Shouts the girl as she dives/pounces towards you. You thought she was going to land rather short, but are startled by the fact that she has leaped farther than any human should be able to as she lands right on top of you, knocking you backwards onto your ass and back. <br />
<br />
She then stands over you, while pinning your arms down with her hands. She is looking down on you with a huge elated grin on her face. You can&#39;t move your arms either, and her one knee is beginning to rub against your crotch. Only now that you are staring right up at her, do you see 2 triangular points poking out the top of her head through her orange hair, and you also realize that her pitch black hands are not due to her wearing gloves. And now you see a large orange tail with a white tip wagging excitedly towards her backside. <br />
<br />
The girl leand her head down closer to your neck and face and says &quot;I&#39;m back! Did my precious chicken futanari girlfriend miss her foxy lover? Because I missed you a lot!&quot; She says and licks your neck. Your heart is pounding, not out of fear anymore, but out of lust. <br />
<br />
This girl is a fox furry and she is exactly your type! She is smaller than you, but not by much, as she is still more than capable of pinning your down all by herself. Her white skin is actually colored pitch black on her hands and feet due to the presence of tiny hairs of fur. Her palms, finger tips, and the bottoms of her feet also are padded it seems. She has a big fluffy fox tail comming out just above her ass which she seemed to only have limited controlling over. There are also 2 fox ears on top of her head, as she lacks her human ones all together. Her hair color you suspect is also not the normal color of a redhead as it is almost too orange.<br />
<br />
But the things that garnered the most of your attention were the 8 lumps being held tightly inside of her top, running down the front half of her torso. &#39;Does this girl really have 8 tits!&#39; You think to yourself and answer her with a cautious &quot;y-yes... I missed you as well, Nora.&quot; <br />
<br />
Her name suddenly came to you, and with it also came a few details about your current relationship. You are dating her seriously, and you have moved in with her. She is by far the dominant one in the relationship. You both are furries, although she is by far more animalistic than you are. This is actually the reason for why you have these wing gloves which you are still currently wearing. Nora always ends up prioritizing your interests above her own, even while maintaining the dominant role, as that is just the kind of girl she is. You also know that she is partial to you having a canine dick when you have sex, but also that she doesn&#39;t really overall mind using whichever shape you feel like having as long as it is able to fit inside of her. <br />
<br />
New memories of your lives together flood into your mind. The year and a half spent widening her pussy in order to fit all of your cock inside of her, her growing in her 3 additional rows of fully developed breasts from her flat torso back  about a week after she turned 16. Up until then, she just had 2 breasts and 6 nipples. Then seemingly over the weekend, she had come back to school with all of them fully grown. You asked her out that day and she happily accepted. <br />
<br />
Now several years later, you still are dating, and that you have been considering making her your official wife. However this has become a tough spot for the both of you. You asked her out, so it is customary that you are the one to also propose, however she wants to do it, as the one who proposes is automatically seen as the center figure of the relationship. You also agree that she should do it, but she is getting pressured not to since you asked her out first, and it would be breaking tradition. Her family is very tied to these traditions, as is yours. You never would have asked her out had you known that this would cause you both to have such an issue. But you also do not regret doing it either, as had you not, then there was no guarantee that she would have asked you out as she was very, very shy back then. So the two of you have been in this state of relationship limbo for the last few years.<br />
<br />
Nora releases your arms from her pin and you quickly wrap them around her back in a hug. Well, as best of a hug you could manage with your arms still inside of your wing gloves that is. At the same time, you can feel her toes are busy with prying at your pussy, trying their best to pull out your cock and balls. You do not have anywhere close to her sense of smell but you could still smell that she was starting to go into her monthly heat cycle, which has replaced her period oddly enough.</p>
