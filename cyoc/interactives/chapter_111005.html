<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He leads her to the far side of the tank, far away from any human scientists. He sits her down on a rock and then sits next to her. &quot;So? What now?&quot; She sits quietly for a while. &quot;I don&#39;t even know your name.&quot; &quot;Oh right. I guess it just never came up. My name is Baxter Sullivan. I am, or was, a broke college student who needed some cash in between paychecks. What about you?&quot; &quot;Well my name used to be Kevin Curry.&quot; She holds her arms out, exposing her chest as evidence. But Baxter already knew that. &quot;I don&#39;t think I look like a Kevin anymore. Do you?&quot; He has to hold himself back from drooling or staring or both and just focus on her eyes. &quot;Not at all. I have an idea. Let&#39;s give ourselves new names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on, it&#39;ll be fun. New bodies, new names. Why don&#39;t you be Kay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kay? Really? You think it&#39;s fine?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure why not? It&#39;s basically a super shortened version of you old name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Kay it is.&quot; &#39;She&#39;s starting to cheer up&#39; Baxter thinks to himself. &#39;Let&#39;s keep this up.&#39;<br />
&quot;Okay now for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You pick since I picked yours. Just nothing too weird.&quot; She taps her chin a few times to think. &quot;Hmm. How about Arthur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur? How come?&quot; &quot;Well it&#39;s just a strong name.&quot; He raises his arms up in a bodybuilder pose. &quot;Strong, eh? Like me?&quot; Kay laughs dreamily. &quot;Yeah. I mean no. I mean stop it.&quot; He puts his arms down but flexes his pecs. They both laugh. &quot;I just like the name. It&#39;s the name of a hero and you kind of saved me earlier.&quot; &quot;Saved you? But they made me do that to you.&quot; &quot;They used you. Just like they used me. We&#39;re both the victim here. But at least I have you to help me through this.&quot; She rests her head on his chest. He moves his arms to hold her but his larger arms reach around more then he had planned and he accidentally palms her breast. He jerks it away quickly. &quot;Oh my gosh, Kay. I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m trying to get used to my new body too and...&quot; &quot;It&#39;s okay, Arthur. We already had sex. I don&#39;t think you touching my boob is too much.&quot; She smirks. &quot;And besides, I know how much you&#39;ve wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; &quot;Please, I used to be a guy too. I remember how great looking at a nice rack can feel. And guessing by these melons...&quot;, she grabs her own large boobs &quot;...you must be losing your mind. Do you like it when I do this?&quot; She squeezes them, letting the flesh roll between her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s great.&quot; &quot;Good. How about when I do this?&quot; Kay leans forward, letting her massive milk sacs float freely in the water, and shakes her chest. They smack into each other again and again, teasing him. She mock pouts at him. &quot;Do you like that Artie?&quot; He snaps out of his trance and leans closer to Kay and kisses her on the lips. He pulls away, leaving her in shock over how tingly that made her feel. &quot;My name is Arthur.&quot; He grabs her arms and goes back into another a kiss, this time with their tongues fighting for space to thrash inside each other&#39;s mouths. The kiss was hot and full of passion, not like the sloppy drunk one under the influence of the chemical.<br />
<br />
They grappled each other on top of the rock, flipping and twisting around fighting for dominance. Eventually, Arthur gets Kay pinned below him and grabs her breasts. He kneads her super sensitive nipples between his fingers and starts sucking on her neck. Even though they can breathe underwater, this gets Kay moaning and gasping for air. Her loud moaning only makes Arthur want her more so he goes harder. He starts to lick her neck and moves his hands down her sides to her hips, right up to where the scales start to spread across her tail. Kay breaks away from the kiss, still gasping for breath. &quot;What is it, Kay?&quot; &quot;Um, you&#39;re bumping into me.&quot; &quot;What do you mean? Jeez, we&#39;re making out. It&#39;s bound to happen.&quot; He goes back for another kiss but she stops him again pointing in between them. &quot;No. I mean, duh. But your you is bumping into my tail.&quot; Arthur looks down to her tail where she&#39;s pointing. His &#39;him&#39; has come out of its slit and is extended out as if trying reach home. He gets off her and floats back to his side of the rock. &quot;Oh jeez, Kay. I didn&#39;t mean to try to force you to do that again. I just can&#39;t control myself. This new body is strong and cool, but I have these new feelings that I don&#39;t know how to control.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of feelings? You can tell me. Hell, who else are you gonna tell?&quot; &quot;Well when we were making out, I wanted more. Don&#39;t laugh but I needed more.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s called lust, Arthur. You&#39;ve felt that before right?&quot; &quot;Of course I had! But it wasn&#39;t that. Believe me, I would love to, I mean your body is beyond amazing. No one with a straight-shooting dick could ever deny you.&quot; She blushes. &quot;But I needed to have you. To claim you. To... fill you.&quot; She looks down at her lap and then to her tail&#39;s large fin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop teasing me, Kay. I felt like I needed to breed with you! Okay?&quot; She looks back at him with a look of surprise splayed across her face. &quot;There I said it. Sorry if I ruined our little arrangement here. I really liked fooling around with you, but I had get this off my chest. I will always want more, Kay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur?&quot; &quot;Yeah?&quot; &quot;What if I told you I felt the same way?&quot; He inches closer to her and puts his hand on her &#39;knee&#39;. &quot;I mean this is all so new and crazy. I used to like girls amd be a human male. A guy! But now, I don&#39;t know. I feel different. And when we kissed, I felt butterflies in my everywhere. I wanted more of you, I wanted... you. I wanted you to be a part of me.&quot; She laughs. &quot;But then your little guy bumped into me a snapped me out of it.&quot; She looks at me and smiles &quot;More like not-so-little guy.&quot; For the first time, Arthur looks down at his larger cock and actually gets to admire it. His dick used to be five inches stiff, but now it has grown as thick as an arm and to just under a foot and a half in length. He laughs too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. Now I&#39;m embarrassed.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t be, it&#39;s impressive. See? What am I saying? Kevin would think I&#39;m crazy. But the new me wants you so bad that I freaking want your baby!&quot; She starts to tear up, if that&#39;s even possible under water. Arthur wipes her cheek. &quot;Kay, do you mean that?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s clear right now. Why do we feel this way?&quot; Arthur ponders for a moment. &quot;Well, like it or not, we&#39;re part animal now. Maybe we&#39;re in heat?&quot; Kay swims off the rock floating upright and holding her arms. &quot;I guess so. But if we go through with this, wouldn&#39;t we be giving Dr. Ferris and the rest of his lackeys what they want?&quot; Arthur follows and hugs her from behind. &quot;Screw them. Let&#39;s do this for us. Come on Kay. If our mating instincts are this strong, imagine how strong our parenting ones will be. You&#39;ll be a great mother.&quot; His kisses her cheek and gently rubs her stomach. She flips around and holds his hands in hers. &quot;Okay let&#39;s do it. And this time we actually get to enjoy it.&quot; Arthur grins and picks up & twirls his baby-mama-to-be, covering her chest in kisses. He slows down and the two begin their journey to parenthood with their real first time as merman and mermaid.</p>
