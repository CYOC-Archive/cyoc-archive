<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley and “Jess” return home the next morning, “so, Jess,” Ashley says, smiling, “did you have fun? Are you looking forward turning back to yourself this evening?”<br />
<br />
Hearing that she’ll be transforming back in a few hours, causes “Jess” to feel weird, one part of her can’t wait to transform back into Jeff, while the other part is not that happy about it. Trying her best to not let Ashley notice her struggle, “Jess” simply smiles, “I must say,” she says, “I did have fun, your friends are really nice. To be honest, being a girl really wasn’t as weird as I thought, I actually enjoyed it, but yeah… I can’t wait to be myself again soon.”<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles, “I am glad you had fun,” she says, “I guess you want to get some rest and enjoy the last hours of being a little girl, before transforming back, hm?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” nods, “yeah,” she says, “I’d like to enjoy the rest of my “Jess-life” by myself, if you don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t mind,” Ashley says, she gives the little “girl” a hug, “I must say… JEFF… I really enjoyed our time together. Maybe we could do something else with that program of yours some other time, there are a few things I’D like to try.”<br />
<br />
“Jess” smiles, “sure,” she says, then both head to their separate rooms.<br />
<br />
<br />
When “Jess” enters her room, she locks the door and then strips out of her clothes, she then walks to her full-length mirror and just stands there for a while, looking at her reflection.<br />
<br />
‘I don’t know why, but… imagining transforming back into my… normal-self… somehow feels odd,’ the little “girl” thinks to herself, ‘it’s as if THIS body were my real body… and that “Jeff” is my “false”-self. But I know that that is not true, that “Jeff” is my real-self and “Jess” is the fake, but… somehow… I don’t want to lose this body.’<br />
<br />
Letting out a sigh, the little “girl” walks over to her bed and lies down on it, staring at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
‘The weirdest part is that ever since I met Rick, I feel drawn to him, he is so handsome, kind, loving, gentle… over all: he is the kind of boy I want to spend my life with… but… the “life” is fake, and I don’t want to throw away my real life, just so I can be with Rick,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
“Jess” looks over at her Laptop, that is when a thought pops into her mind, ‘may-maybe… I can live both lives,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I just need to be careful, I don’t want my family to know, I know what I’ll do: I give myself shape-shifting abilities! That way I can transform into Jeff and Jess at will!’<br />
<br />
“Jess” jumps from her bed and heads to her Laptop, powering it up, she then opens the program and pulls up her file. The girl looks at her stats, she does notice some weird changes, but she just shrugs, and simply gives herself the shape-shifting ability, which causes the timer to vanish.<br />
<br />
The girl smiles, ‘now I can become “Jeff” whenever I need to, in order to keep this a secret, I better hide the ability, also I should transform into “Jeff” this evening, so that Ashley doesn’t get suspicious,’ she thinks to herself. After hiding her ability to shape shift, “Jess” password protects her file, not wanting Ashley to get any ideas, and simply to prevent anyone from discovering the truth.<br />
<br />
Feeling happy and relieved, that she found a way to stay with Rick, without her family noticing, “Jess” heads back to her bed and decides to take a nap, it has been an interesting and exciting weekend. Before “Jess” passes out, the last thought on her mind was Rick and her cuddling close, with “Jess” resting her head on Rick’s muscular chest.<br />
<br />
Later that evening, “Jess” feels her body tingle, the little “girl” lets out a sigh, “I guess my time as “Jess” is up,” she says to herself, “BUT it won’t be the last time I transform into “Jess”.”<br />
<br />
Once the transformation is over, and Jeff is back being himself, the 16-year-old looks down his body, when his eyes land on his cock, the boy grimaces, ‘I never knew how weird having a cock feels,’ he thinks to himself, ‘it feels wrong… like I shouldn’t have a cock,’ he then grins, ‘well… I can fix that, no one will know!’<br />
<br />
Jeff closes his eyes and concentrates on his crotch, willing it to shrink, willing his balls to reenter his body, willing them to become ovaries, his seed to become ovulum, willing a womb and birth channel to form inside of him. The teen smiles and bites his lips as he moans in pleasure as he feels his crotch change, when Jeff opens his eyes and looks down, he smiles wide when he sees a hairless virgin pussy instead of an annoying dangling piece of meet between his legs, “much better,” he says to himself.<br />
<br />
“JEFF,” he then hears his mom call, “WE’RE BACK! WE BROUGHT SOME PIZZA!”<br />
<br />
‘Good thing I’m myself again,’ Jeff thinks to himself, “COMING MOM,” he then calls back, he then quickly gets changed into some boy clothes, which he finds feel really uncomfortable on him, ‘hm… better fix that later,’ he thinks to himself, ‘for now it has to do!’<br />
<br />
After dinner, Jeff hurries back into his room and locks his door, he then heads to his Laptop and opens the program, ‘let’s get to work,’ he thinks to himself, ‘first, I need a secret room, which I’ll design into a more suitable room for an 8-year-old girl, I’ll also need a much girlier phone, some make-up, jewelry, clothes, anything a girl needs!’<br />
<br />
Jeff opens the scan-screen and activates the scan function, he is then asked what or who he’d like to scan:<br />
<br />
Jane (mom)<br />
Mike (dad)<br />
Ashley (10-year-old sister)<br />
Max (pet dog)<br />
Jake (6-year-old brother)<br />
Jeff’s room<br />
Ashley’s room<br />
Parent’s room<br />
Living room<br />
Kitchen<br />
Dining room<br />
Jake’s room<br />
Whole House<br />
<br />
Jeff selects his room, then he is asked what he’d like to change, after scrolling through the options, he soon finds what he is looking for: secret room, which he selects. Then he is asked to name the location where the secret room should be, so the teen types: “hidden door behind built-in bookshelves, to open hidden door, pull on blue book.”<br />
<br />
After confirming the change, Jeff’s room seems to shimmer, like tar on a hot summer’s day, then a message pops up, “change completed”. Jeff walks to his book shelve, which is built into the back wall of his room, and pulls on the blue book. The teen hears a “click” and steps back, smiling when the book shelve opens in front of him, when he steps through the opening, he finds himself in a large, still, empty room.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s smile grows, “perfect,” he says, “now I need a bed, walk-in closet, a desk, a TV, a nice comfy chill out corner, maybe with some beanbags, some clothes, some other stuff a girl like me… I mean “Jess”… might need.”<br />
<br />
The teen knows that it won’t be cheap to buy all of those things, but when he returns to his Laptop, a thought pops into his mind, which causes him to grin evilly, “who says I have to “buy” all those things,” he asks himself, “I should transform something into my second phone, then copy the Chronivac onto it, that’ll make everything easier.”<br />
<br />
As Jeff looks around his room, trying to find something he could transform into HIS “girl-phone”, he absentmindedly strokes over his flat crotch, smiling happily to himself, enjoying the feeling of having a flat crotch.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes soon land on a comic book, one that he hadn’t read in months, “perfect,” he says to himself, grabbing the book, soon a phone in a glittery case is lying next to his Laptop. The teen attaches the phone to his laptop and soon has the Chronivac copied over, along with all the files he already had scanned.<br />
<br />
Leaning back in his seat, Jeff smiles to himself, ‘tomorrow, at school, I’ll start and get the things I need,’ he thinks to himself, his smile then turns into a grin, ‘no one will ever know, that “Jess” is here to stay. Hmm… I just remember, I forgot to ask Rick for his number, I need to get a hold of Ashley’s phone and call Mandy and ask if Rick is there.’<br />
<br />
Later that night, when everyone is asleep, Jeff quietly sneaks into his sister’s room and grabs her phone, ‘good thing Ashley is such a deep sleeper,’ he thinks to himself as he scrolls through the phone until he finds Mandy’s number. Jeff then takes out his “girl-phone” and adds the number to it, then he quietly leaves the room and heads back to his own, ‘tomorrow,’ he thinks with a smile, ‘I’ll call Mandy and ask Rick for his number.’</p>
