<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris arrived at a small hostel a few blocks far from his home. It was cheap and close to his house, so it was perfect in case he needed to go back as soon as possible. He had seen the building before but he had never came in until now and he immediately realized that it was quite crowded. Fortunately, they still have room for one more and after paying he was leaded to a big room with several beds.<br />
<br />
The receptionist told him that place only has two main rooms, one for males and one for females. So, Chris had to share the place with other guys whose bags and suitcases were on their respective beds. He sighed, he wasn&#39;t quite comfortable with that but he had limited choices in his current situation. He took a bed close to a door that he later found out it&#39;s a bathroom. He put his suitcase under the bed and tried to sleep a little.<br />
<br />
After a while, he woke up and noticed that at least 5 guys were in the room with him. Some of them looked like tourist and some others like tramps, but none of them looked older than 40 years old. It was the first time he was on his own and he felt kinda awkward when some of those men were undressing or in different states of nudity. Chris&#39; back shivered when one of them took his briefs out exposing a dense bush of pubes over a small but thick cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Are you gay or something? Why are you looking at me like that?&quot; The man told Chris who immediately snapped out of the trance he was for a moment. &quot;S-sorry.&quot; Chris said while he looked away and blushed in shame. It wasn&#39;t his intention to keep his eyes on him, but it was his first time seeing another dick than his, and even his own dick looked foreign to him right now. He didn&#39;t notice but he was starting to grow a boner.<br />
<br />
When Chris noticed the tent in his pants he tried to distract himself by looking at his phone. His parents had answered his message and they&#39;d told him they didn&#39;t know about any clock. His dad even offered to buy him an smartwatch for his next birthday. Chris smiled a little at the irony. He definitely didn&#39;t need to get older. After sending them some more texts, he dropped the phone on the bed and lay down on it for a while.<br />
<br />
He managed to convince his parents he was at a sleepover with a few friends. His mother insisted for a while to go there and check if he needed something but he insisted he&#39;s fine and he doesn&#39;t want an embarrassing moment with her. She reluctantly agreed but she asked him to back home as soon as he can tomorrow morning. &quot;I have a day to solve this.&quot; Chris thought while he agreed to his mom&#39;s petition.<br />
<br />
He was laying on the bed when he felt a gurgling sound coming from his belly. He&#39;s hungry and he doesn&#39;t know where to get some food in there. He asked the naked man from before who harshly told him there is a vending machine at the reception. He went there and bought a bag of cookies and a juice but when he was coming back to his bed, he stumbled and the juice felt all over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid giant feet!&quot; He cursed while he tried to recover himself, two women who watched him were giggling and one of them suggested he should take his shirt off because it&#39;s soaked with juice. He didn&#39;t answer, the idea of being shirtless in front of two girls was very embarrassing for him and he tried to leave as fast as he can, but they were faster and now they&#39;re surrounding him.<br />
<br />
He tried to say no, but the shame was making feel stiff. And something else was getting stuff too. He blushed when he realized he was getting a boner again and this time he didn&#39;t have his phone to distract himself. One of the ladies started to unbutton his shirt while the other was massaging his broad back. The erection in his pants was quite obvious right now, but despite how uncomfortable he was he was at their mercy.</p>
