<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian shivered a little from the intimate contact with Dar and tried to think.  This all seemed crazy, but Mike was turning into a horse.  What was the big deal about him becoming a different human?  Well, and elf becoming a human - but one who had magic!  &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  He stared back at the pond&#39;s surface.  &quot;What about Mike?  I need to help him.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;d work with me, and we take care of the Wizard&#39;s horses all the time.  They get the best care possible, and live a wonderful life!&quot;  Dar continued to masturbate him, and it was getting harder to concentrate.  It felt like there was a lot more of him down there.  <br />
<br />
This could be really fun.  And Tye had acted pretty bossy already.  He&#39;d probably just get worse as the game went on.  Game.  This was all just a game, even if he didn&#39;t know how Tye was doing it.<br />
<br />
Dar shifted his grip, and Brian gasped at the renewed pleasure.  Then he looked down at himself and gasped again.  The slender elven cock had swollen out in the boy&#39;s grip, now looking a lot more like what the reflection showed.  <br />
<br />
Dar chuckled.  &quot;See?  Once you start accepting it, change is easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian stared for another few seconds, then roused himself and jerked free of Dar&#39;s loose embrace.  His body looked larger, darker, and dirty.  &quot;I...  I don&#39;t know if I want this.  We need to take care of Mike, first!&quot;  Flushed, he spun and ran back to the path and headed for the pasture.  Dar caught up easily, and stayed behind until they broke out of the trees.  <br />
<br />
Mike was back in the middle of the pasture with the big black mare he had mounted the first time.  As soon as he saw them, the centaur trotted towards them, only to look confused.  &quot;Where is Brian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here!&quot;  Brian frowned, then glanced down at himself and remembered he was not only naked, but probably different looking.  &quot;I just got changed some, too.&quot;  Then he looked back at Mike.  &quot;Looks like I am not the only one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike grinned a bit sheepishly.  His upper body was now covered completely in horse hide to match his lower body, and his face protruded out more.  Looking close, Brian realized his friend&#39;s eyes were completely those of a horse, huge brown orbs with rectangular irises.  &quot;The mare is very persuasive.  And it felt like my balls were going to explode.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you fucked her even though you knew you would become more animal?&quot;  Brian shook his head and sighed, then stiffened as Dar came up behind him and enveloped him in another embrace.  He was starting to feel excited by the touch of the other boy, and when he looked at Mike he also had a strange urge to watch his friend become a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t put him down for liking sex!&quot;  Dar&#39;s cock was hard and sliding against Brian&#39;s butt crack.  &quot;There is a lot of power in sexual desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot;  Mike stared at Brian.  &quot;I can see you changing.  Is that what it looks like when I mount the mare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alarmed, Brian jerked free and ran over to the drinking pond.  The boy looking back at him was more Dar than Brian&#39;s elven self, though the ears had slight points and he could see some of his old features.  Dar followed him, still grinning, and also naked.  <br />
<br />
Mike shuffled behind, obviously curious and grinning.  &quot;Don&#39;t fight it, Brian.  You are way better off like the kid there.  Stronger, and hung way better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about you? &quot;  Brian looked back at Mike.  &quot;You gonna become a stallion?  Spend all your time eating grass and mounting mares?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;ll have much more than that for him to do.&quot;  The Wizard&#39;s voice made them turn to see the man watching them from a short distance away.  &quot;An intelligent war horse is a priceless commodity in this world, worth more than gold.  When I join your party of adventurers, he will serve as my mount.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you will be way more valuable with magic and strength.&quot;  Dar took Brian&#39;s hand and led him back to Mike.  &quot;Give your friend a boost.  Cup his testicles with your hands and will them to be full again.  He needs a good recharge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike twisted to look back at them.  &quot;Recharge?  I don&#39;t know if I can stand another round with this mare.  Sex is short but intense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious, Brian did as instructed and hefted the massive black sack between Mike&#39;s hind legs.  Dar embraced him from behind again and said &quot;Now imagine him mounting the mare again.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was easy to picture, and after a moment Brian felt the testicles swell.  In moments, the orbs inside were swollen taught, heavy and warm.  Mike shuddered.  &quot;Oh, man!  That is amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dar led Brian back over to the pond, and this time the reflection had no elven features at all.  He was still shorter and younger than Dar, but Brian now looked like a younger brother to the stable boy.  He stared, looking down to confirm this was no illusion.  Dar embraced him from behind again, and this time the prod came lower.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I do believe we will have things done in time to meet your friends this evening.&quot;  Llandros chuckled.  &quot;There was no need for me to come out here at all.  Very good work, Dar.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a guttural neigh and Brian turned his head to see Mike starting yet another courtship with the mare, who looked most happy to oblige.  He was feeling hot and sweaty and aroused himself, and leaned back into the larger boy&#39;s chest.  He felt Dar squat slightly, and the hard prod of the stable boy&#39;s cock was against his anus.  Mike pushed and slid over the mare&#39;s back just as Dar suddenly stood and thrust into Brian.  Multiple gasps and grunts came at the same moment.<br />
<br />
Brian was lifted off his feet, pinioned on the larger boy&#39;s shaft.  The pain was intense, the huge cock seeming like an arm shoved up inside him.  Dar drove harder, deeper, then began to piston inside Brian.  He and Mike were thrusting in unison.  Brian was lowered as they continued, the pain and pressure easing as he enlarged, and the sex became enjoyable.  He gasped and grunted and cried out with each hard shove, the sounds now indistinguishable from those Dar was making.  <br />
<br />
The enhancement to Mike must have been substantial, for the centaur continued mounting the mare far past any normal mating time.  Brian could just see Mike and the mare, the centaur hunched over so far that it was hard to tell he was not a horse.  But then Brian realized that it wasn&#39;t that Mike was hunched over.  The former centaur was rapidly completing the transformation, his extended sexual encounter accelerating the change.  Before he could see the last of Mike&#39;s changes, Brian fell to all fours with Dar on top.  Then even the amazing sight of the centaur becoming a stallion was lost as Brian found his own orgasm and once again neighs and shouts split the air in unison.<br />
<br />
They lay in the grass for a while, Dar and Brian sweaty and streaked with dirt and filth.  Dar grinned and tousled Brian&#39;&#39;s hair, which was now long and matted.  An amazing black stallion was grazing by the mare.  Brian crawled to the pond, where he found Dar&#39;s face staring back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I am going back to pack.  Be ready when I come back.  We will leave here and head straight for the adventurer&#39;s camp.&quot;  Llandros walked over and patted Mike&#39;s side.  The huge stallion snorted and edged away, ears flattened.  &quot;Oh, no you don&#39;t.&quot;  Llandros muttered something.  &quot;There.  You are my horse, well trained and loyal.&quot;  The stallion snorted again, but this time nuzzled the Wizard and lipped gently at his sleeve.  &quot;Good boy, Midnight.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to Mike?&quot;  Brian felt concern, but could not work up any real worry. <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s still your friend, mostly.  But now he is a trained warhorse with memories of serving me for many years.  Don&#39;t worry.    He is totally content and happier as a horse than he ever was as a human.  And now that he has a horse&#39;s soul, he will stay that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You changed his soul?&quot;  Brian gaped.  &quot;But what happens when he changes back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dar chuckled.  &quot;That is not an issue.  He&#39;s a horse now and forever.  No matter where he goes, even if he ends up back in the world you came from, he&#39;ll be a horse.  Willing transformation is permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot;  Brian felt a sudden chill.  &quot;Did you change my soul?&quot;<br />
<br />
Llandros grinned.  &quot;Just a little bit of horse, just like Dar.  Adjustable, too.&quot;  He muttered something and Brian felt his thoughts thicken, his body feeling odd, misshapen.  &quot;That&#39;s about half horse, no comprehension of symbols or numbers, and feeling wrong as a human.&quot;  Another spell and his mind cleared again.  Llandros nodded to Dar.  &quot;You can explain the rules to him while I get packed.  And there will be time for you to have some more fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the wizard left.<br />
<br />
