<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ronald Donovan was a quiet 35 year old man. He had an office job, and was about to get a promotion and a hefty bonus before the incident occurred. People at work would describe him as friendly, and in the chaotic world of Spectacle when someone nearby would get injured he would allow everyone to see his power. He could close cuts, mend bones, and sooth burns. Many people around him would call him a healer, and wonder why he didn&#39;t go into a medical field or join any hero groups. If asked he would say that he didn&#39;t think of himself any good as a doctor or a fighter. He was just someone with a great power who felt it was his responsibility to help out when someone nearby got hurt. On occasion he&#39;d go out drinking or join a nice lady out for a cup of coffee, but he never really got too close to anyone. No one guessed that his power wasn&#39;t actually healing others. <br />
<br />
In truth his power allowed him to bend bodies close to him in any way he wanted assuming he could imagine how it would work. Basic anatomy gave him enough knowledge to be able to heal most injuries, but in his more experimental teenage years he&#39;d look online for certain interesting details. He&#39;d enlarge his penis or turn himself into a girl temporarily, but eventually he grew out of the masturbatory phase. He also grew fearful that if he dated anyone and they ever discovered his strong power they&#39;d grow fearful of him and what he could do to them. In truth one day when he was jumped by a mugger he found it was quite easy for him to turn the guy holding a knife close to him into a puddle of flesh, and nearly jumped for joy that he was in a dark alley away from prying eyes. <br />
<br />
Feeling a bit lonely by himself Ronald got himself a golden retriever he named Melissa, and she was a great comfort in his life. Such unconditional love was just what he needed, but also lead him to some odd thoughts. &quot;If only women could love me like this if they knew what I could do... wait... what if?..&quot; and then he brought Melissa into the basement which he had been originally been making into a man cave of sorts... Which was important as there was a bathroom down there along with a mini-fridge and a real comfortable couch that could pull out into a bed if needed. He then started reading up more on dog and human biology and began his experiment. <br />
<br />
All was going pretty well until when Ronald was off at work Melissa figured out how to unlock the basement door, and was discovered as a 6-foot tall busty blonde taking a shit on a neighbor&#39;s lawn. With Ronald&#39;s front door open. Ronald got home fast enough and managed to grab Melissa and take her back into his home. There would be a lot of questions, but he couldn&#39;t just leave her... She needed him and... Doors fully locked, and the basement door reinforced Ronald&#39;s paranoia ran high. They&#39;d find out what he had done to Melissa. he had managed to make her dog body into that of a human&#39;s. The only thing he hadn&#39;t changed yet was her mind... How could he change that into a humans, but still keep her memories and personality? Was it possible? He had an idea, but he was scared to even try the procedure. <br />
<br />
The local police came and knocked on the door, but got no response. They came back with a warrant, and then had to breach the home. They searched and came across the basement door. It was metal and a lot more bolted down than the other doors in the house, and on the other side of the door was Ronald as he lay his back to the side of the door. He stroked Melissa&#39;s shiny long hair to try to alleviate both of their stress as the cops were rummaging around. He heard cops outside the door talking about needing something more powerful to knock down this door Ronald grew a bit angry. His powers worked best and most precisely at contact, but for what he wanted to do being separated by just a few feet would work enough for his powers. <br />
<br />
The cops felt a twinge of pain in their arms and checked and saw &quot;LEAVE&quot; carved in shallow wounds over their forearms. Knowing this went above their pay grade they left, and brought in some supers. Scared when one with enhanced strength and endurance broke down his door he held Melissa&#39;s head. Whether or not what he was doing would erase the dog he loved or not... If they separated her from him as she was now then she&#39;d only be some experiment. <br />
<br />
Melissa in a split second experienced a lot as her mind grew and became capable of all sorts of connections... and then a lot of things happened as her master got quickly knocked unconscious, and dragged off. Some big man covering her with her bed sheets and asking her something about if she was ok? What was even going on?<br />
<br />
Ronald ended up getting classified as just barely a &quot;mad scientist&quot; considering the reports about Melissa, and his power was powerful enough to consider him a potent threat to any hero. It also landed him the nickname &quot;Twister&quot; and got him locked up in The Protector&#39;s building. There he sat in an orange jumpsuit in a small room designed to contain his powers. At which point the next thing he had in store was...</p>
