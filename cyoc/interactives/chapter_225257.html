<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Denise ran the math as she drove through town on her way to her mate’s place of business. She theorized that to make enough of her air borne furry virus to blanket the entire world, she would need at least two metric tons to be released in the jet stream. Allowing the currents of air high up in the atmosphere to distribute the virus to every corner of the world. Such a vast quantity would be difficult to make in such a short time; the logistics of releasing the virus would also be a hurdle. But as she entered downtown, Denise noticed her runes glowing; realizing she had to put on her glamour. Not wanting regular humans to see a an anthro tigress furry driving a green hatchback with mismatching front end. A gift from her ex-boyfriend who ran out her when she had a pregnancy scare a few years back. He decided he wasn’t ready to be a father and quickly left her small bungalow. Jumping in his jeep he floored his vehicle only bash the front end of her car with his rear as he tried to back out. The insurance covered to fix the damages but by then, the relationship was already over. Fortunately she only missed her period due to stress from a possible new covid wave that never happened and thus didn’t have a fetus growing in her.<br />
<br />
Now that she was a furry, Denise was eager to be a mother; she couldn’t wait to have her mate Michael Proudhoof fill her with his seed and have it take root and produce a cub. Her thoughts of motherhood were interrupted when her runes glowed again. She checked and was certain that her glamour was active, but that was then she had an ideal.<br />
“Why not marry science with magic,” Denise smiling as she stopped at a red light; “I don’t need to produce a large quantity of the virus; just a concentrated amount and have magic keep it viable long enough to reach as many hosts as possible.”<br />
Denise smiled at this revelation as the light turned green and she gunned her car in excitement. <br />
“And I can use mundane animals as a vector to spread the virus as well,” Denise seeing the sign of her mate’s restaurant and pulling into a parking spot on the street; “they should be immune and can help spread our gift as a backup method of spreading.”<br />
<br />
Getting out of her car after turning off the engine she saw several fellow furry’s already walking out of Proudmoores&#39;.<br />
“I hope Michael intends to change that sign,” Denise nodding to the furries as the walk by. Like her they had glamour’s up to appear human, they also had dopey grins on their muzzles and they have the scent of sex permeating from them. Denise grinned as she walked into the restaurant.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to Proud…” the waitress/hostess said in greeting before stopping herself in surprised shock. Like Denise the waitress was a furry; an anthro cheetah furry as she stared at the gobsmacked waitress.<br />
“Were you about to say Proudmoores’,” Denise speaking; “I know the name will soon change to Proudhoofs’, Michael is my mate.”<br />
“Oh,” the Cheetah furry perking up; “you must be the doctor! Did you get his text message?”<br />
“Text message,” Denise looking confused before rolling her eye with a noticeable growl; “I must have left my phone back in my office.”<br />
“No matter,” the cheetah furry ushering the tigress furry inside; “the boss is busy, but will definitely make time for you. Please take a seat and I’ll let him know you are here.”<br />
“Can I get a coke with lemon,” Denise taking her seat; ensuring her question will keep the waitress from bolting off right away.<br />
“Sure,” She answers before remembering her duties and leaving a menu at the table.<br />
<br />
Denise tanked the waitress and perused the menu; seeing only a handle of appetizers and entrees for lunch; Denise surmised that the menu changes daily thus ensuring that ingredients are always fresh. While she was hungry, she didn’t want anything heavy so settled on a grilled chicken Caesar salad. Putting the menu down; Denise finally takes a look at the dining area; it wasn’t packed with customers, but the dozen or so she did see, were already furrys.<br />
“Wonder what was put in the food or drinks,” Denise musing to herself, as the furrys were clearly spending time kissing each other passionately between bites of food. A few actively engaging in some heavy petting.  Her thoughts were soon interrupted when the waitress returned with her drink, followed by an antro stag-deer furry. Instantly recognizing her mate, she gets up and embraces him passionately.<br />
“Did you not get my text,” Michael giving Denise a loving kiss while stroking her sensitive entrance with a hoof-hand.<br />
“I was out of the office, and left my phone there,” Denise sighing from his touch. Smiling as Michael lets go and takes a seat next to her. She watches as he licks his hoof clean of her juices; watching as he enjoys the taste of her honey. “I was busy performing a few small scale experiments,” Denise adding as she sips her drink; “so I decided to surprise you with a lunch time visit. FYI you need to change the sign.”<br />
“It’s on the to-do list,” Michael acknowledging that restaurant sign is that of his old human surname. “Well since you are here,” Michael smiling; “I’m organizing a dinner party for later this evening. An opportunity to meet my son’s, their mate’s and said mate’s parents. But I see no reason to deprive you a chance to meet your stepsons now,” Michael grinning.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Denise found the salad delicious as she listened to Michael regal her with his morning’s activities. Turning his executive chef into an anthro Badger furry with dosed coffee and getting a blow job from the transforming man. With him and his twin son’s they soon made quick work with the staff as they showed. Denise soon learned that the cheetah furry was the next to arrive after Greg. She also grabbed a cup of coffee from the same infected pot and was soon giving hand jobs to both Jimmy and Jake while Michael was lying below her with his muzzle buried in her rapidly changing sex. She now goes by the name of Sasha Quickpaws and was attending college classes to be a paralegal while working part time as a waitress.<br />
“Just so long as you didn’t dip your wick in her,” Denise grinning slyly; “I’m the only female you shall seed and breed.”<br />
“Dad if you don’t mind,” Jake getting up; “I’d like to get back to the kitchen.”<br />
“Alright,” Michael nodding; “see if Greg needs helps with the online orders, we seem to be getting lots of them today.”<br />
 “Fine,” Jake nodding; “but I do have to begin prepping the dinner service. So it’s not as if Greg doesn’t have line cooks to boss around for that.”<br />
“I got to get back to the computer,” Jimmy also getting up; “I still have vendor invoices to deal with.”<br />
“Just be sure you are ready for this evening,” Michael responding; “and make sure you get confirmation that the the red snapper will be here by next Monday.<br />
“We maybe furrys,” Micheal smiling as he turns to Denise; “but we still have a business to run.”<br />
“And I should be getting back to my lab,” Denise finishing her salad; “I have more tests to run. I have a few more ideals in making our gift’s transmission more effective.”<br />
“Don’t be afraid to get others to help you,” Michael getting up with Denise; “and don’t worry about paying for lunch. You are my mate,” Michael giving the Tigress fury a kiss before heading to the back.<br />
<br />
Denise stared at the stag’s ass as he walked away. Enjoying the sight of his cute stubby withe tail twitch as he exaggerated his walking gait; purposely making it sexy; Denise could help but rumble in waiting to feel his shaft in her empty snatch again.<br />
“Good things come to those who wait,” Denise sighed as she leaves a tip for Sasha. turning around just in time to see a group of four humans walk in. She grins as the same waitress greats them and shows them to a table. Noticing the waitress giving the bartender a nod, Denise smiles as they will soon be sexually ambivalent furries long before they order lunch.<br />
“Back to the hospital and perhaps I should spread my gift to a few doctors and nurses,” Denise musing while leaving the restaurant.</p>
