<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, Coral was up earlier than any other family member. With her body she ate breakfast that was big enough for 3 fully grown men. As she prepared it, she noticed the device laying in the kitchen. Her mother must have forgotten to hide it from her, so she took the opportunity and threw it into her schoolbag with the stylus she still had attached.<br />
<br />
Just as Adam woke up, she left the house. Before all the changes, Coral would normally take the bus to school. But now since she is more than 10 feet tall and very muscular, the once long way to school felt more like a short walk to the local grocery store. After chilling in front of the school for a few minutes and reading some messages on her comparably tiny smartphone, the school opened and she entered, heading for her locker.<br />
<br />
It had some scratches here and there, even some dents thanks to some accidental destruction on her end. She layed down the bag and grabbed the books she needed. But as she did so, the bag fell over and the device slipped out. Coral didnt even notice it and headed straight for the classroom with the books in one hand and the bag in the other. Another girl just so happened to notice the device slipping out.<br />
<br />
It was Jessica (or Jess, at least for her friends). A few years ago before puberty really hit them, Jessica was the popular girl in class and more developed than most of them. Thanks to some reality changes here and there, Coral only started to grow this unbelievably huge as soon as puberty hit her, so before she was feeling relatively insecure. That was mostly thanks to Jess and her arrogant personality. But as soon as Coral outgrew her by a whole foot and by several dozen pounds of muscle, Jess&#39; attitude didn&#39;t change, but she was jealous as can be. Coral got more self esteem as she grew on until she was her proud and confident self she is today.<br />
<br />
Jess wanted to get back at her for having won the genetic lottery multiple times over, and she thought about wrecking the device and leaving it in front of her locker to really piss her off. Of course she didn&#39;t want her to know that she was the one who destroyed it, otherwise she would most likely end up in hospital, at least. But as soon as she got a hold of the device, something was weird about it. She saw a whole array of stats along a 3d model of Coral on the screen. She apparently had to be rich too since this tiny device was powerful enough to do this!<br />
<br />
Instead of wrecking it, she decided to keep it for herself or maybe sell it for a good sum of money. She leaned against a windowsill and played around with it. Bit by bit she was getting the hang of how it works. Much to Coral&#39;s dismay. Since she hated Coral so much, she decided to mess up her stats and shsow her who&#39;s boss... well, at least in this virtual world.<br />
<br />
She started off by decreasing her muscle mass to just slightly above average. Meanwhile in the classroom, Coral lost most of her definition and size, but nobody, including herself, seemed to notice or care.<br />
Next she took away her breasts her ass, making her almost flat. Now Coral was sitting in the classroom looking like a huge beanstalk.<br />
Lastly, she took away her height and left her at 5 feet tall, less than half her usual height. Now Coral was back to being normal, maybe slightly above in terms of athleticism.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at home, Barbara&#39;s insane body was knocked down by huge amounts as well, leaving her at 5&#39;8&quot;, athletic and with slightly above average curves.<br />
<br />
Jessica wouldn&#39;t be able to notice any change as well, of course, but still she decided to see how she&#39;d look if she got a whole lot bigger.<br />
<br />
First she wanted to get a tiny bit taller, changing her stats from 5&#39;8&quot; to 6 feet flat. But now that she thought about it 7 feet sounded better. But since Coral&#39;s old body was still lingering in the back of her mind, she decided to go full on out on height at 11 feet tall.<br />
Next up she wanted some real curves. She never was flat by any means, far from it, but something about breasts twice the size of her head intrigued her. and of course an ass equally as impressive was in order as well.<br />
<br />
At first she thought that was enough and applied the changes, but then she remembered what she wanted to see happen on the device. Her curves have always seen incredibly heavy to her, even despite her height. So she bumped up her muscle levels to perfectly athletic and pressed apply.<br />
<br />
While her curves were much more manageable than before, she wanted to see more and bumped them up a little more. Now there was almost no weight to them at all, but going to the gym pretty much every day to maintain these muscles sucked. Just out of interest, she increased them by a huge amount to see how it would look (in addition to some serious changes to her muscle tone and density) and pressed apply. She now had the muscles that were at least equal to a female bodybuilder but without the loss of any curves. And since her muscles were that much more defined and denser than any human should have, she didn&#39;t even need to work out. She never knew why she kept on getting bigger and stronger, but she didn&#39;t really mind as long as it continued on and kept her superiority.</p>
