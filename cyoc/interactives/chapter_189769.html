<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr Simon gathered his stuff into his briefcase as all the students left the classroom with the usual chitter-chatter. He made himself  look busy eyeing up some old tests he still had to grade, just to watch Jake walk out, and he was rewarded as he caught a glimpse of the boy adjusting his cock through his sweatpants. He definetely was packing a bit more than when he came in. <br />
<br />
Mr Simon&#39;s mind drifted thinking about the senior student, when someone knocked the already open door and greeted him. <br />
<br />
- &quot;Hey Noah. Am I interrupting ?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr Simon didn&#39;t have to guess who the guest was, as just a handfull of the faculty members called him by his given name. In any case, the voice of the math teacher was hard to miss, low and deep as it was.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Scotty! come in. I was just going through some formulas in my head&quot;<br />
<br />
- &quot;You really have to learn how to disconnect buddy. You&#39;ll end up forgetting what it was to be on the other side of that board&quot; - Said Scott as he approached the teacher&#39;s desk <br />
<br />
Scott was one of the other few teachers who Noah felt comfortable with. Their relationship kicked off really quick as they started teaching the exact same day, three years ago. <br />
<br />
The math teacher was also in his early thirties yet he managed to look as stylish as the teenagers roaming the halls. His easygoing nature made him a favorite between students. Noah suspected that his looks played also a role in that. <br />
<br />
Nodenying that Scott was a handsome man. Hazel eyes on a ginger was a perfect combination. He towered Noah, being 6 feet tall with broad shoulders and a stocky build. He had some decent arms which filled his sleeves just right and he didn&#39;t have to wear tight clothes for you to know that some meaty pecs were underneath. Noah had seen Scott doing some laps at the fields, trying to stay fit. He had spent some time eyeing him out during their coffee sessions at the teacher&#39;s lounge.<br />
<br />
-&quot;Lord forbid me of getting my brain trapped at age 18 as you did&quot; - Said Mr Simon with the usual spiky tone he dedicated only to mock his buddy<br />
<br />
-&quot;Laugh all you want, but I can hear your joints cracking every time you move, gramps&quot; - Replied Scott<br />
<br />
Noah softly punched Scott in the arm and for his buddy&#39;s delight, one of his knucles cracked loudly. <br />
<br />
-&quot;I rest my case ...&quot; - Said Scott and crossed his arms over his chest. <br />
<br />
Noah could see the muscles on his forearms bulge under a dusting of red hear. Scott was really sexy, now that he thought it through. Such a big man, Noah started wondering what could he become if ...<br />
<br />
Noah put his hand into his pocket feeling the rest of the chewing gums still resting inside. <br />
<br />
-&quot;Anyways&quot; - Continued Scott - &quot;Are you busy until lunch&quot; ? <br />
<br />
-&quot;Not really&quot; - Answered Noah, curiously frowning at Scott - &quot;Wrestling practice is not until a few hours so Im free. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
-&quot;I was going to play badmington with Zeke today but he sprained his ankle. Wanna join me ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah was strucked. Normally he wouldn&#39;t be excited to be invited to do sports. He liked to help at wrestling practice mostly for the eye candy and as it didn&#39;t need much excertion. However, the opportunity to spend some time with a sweaty and pumped Scott was something he couldn&#39;t miss. They would surely hit the locker room and he might finally caught a glimpse of what&#39;s underneath the belt of his buddy.  Scott had a nice, round butt. Nothing too big, just right for a guy his size. Nevertheless, whatever was hidden in the front side of his briefs was still a mistery to Noah. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! I&#39;m in&quot; Said Noah, maybe with a bit too much enthusiasm. Yet Scott didn&#39;t catch it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, you never do any ... wait, what? Seriously ?&quot; - Scott would&#39;ve never guessed it would be this easy to convince his buddy to join him. He was ready to beg a bit and he even planned ahead a bit of a pity-dramatic speech to puppy-eye the chemistry teacher into some action at courts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, let&#39;s do this. I can use blowing off some steam now&quot; - Noah said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; - Scott closed the distance between the two with a single step and put his hand in the air opening for a high-five.  &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah could see Scott&#39;s big arm bulge the sleeve of his shirt as he clapped his arm in the air. Maybe Noah was just already too turned on by watching Jake change in front of him, yet now he could only think of Scott. Normally he wouldn&#39;t have targeted his closest friend at school, yet something inside him was desiring to watch Scott become more of a man than he already was. He couldn&#39;t resist it any more ... <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a thing Scotty. Grab some gum pal. I can smell the tuna sandwhich you had this morning ... &quot; - Noah pulled out from his pocket another gum, from the same batch he had given to Jake and offered him to the math teacher, expecting his white lie to pass by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn&quot; - exclaimed Scott as he checked his breath, looking for a smell that wasnt there - &quot;I owe you big time buddy&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott picked the gum and started chewing, not suspecting a thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we?&quot; - He said, as he turned to face the door. <br />
<br />
Luckily he did turn away, as Mr Simon was starting to get a chubby from anticipation ...</p>
