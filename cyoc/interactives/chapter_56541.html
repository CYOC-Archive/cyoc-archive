<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joulian jumped in his Jeep and floored it out of the center, the entire staff still in dire confusion. He escaped, scotch free, the entire time running through the facility he had his friend Daryl block out all the security cameras. There he was flying down the street with at least a million dollars worth of electronics, but not just any electronics, but things that could alter the very being of a person. He knew this to be true. He had been reading the papers about this new experiment and didn’t like the idea of the government controlling peoples bodies. He decided to steal some for himself for pleasure and even to make a quick dollar. Little known to him, or anyone for that matter the technology is easily cloned. <br />
<br />
When Joulian got home he had a house full of friends waiting to see if the devices were real he didn’t expect Daryl to be hiding in the woods by his house, waiting for Joul to make a mistake and steal the device for himself. As Joul entered the house all the guys were sitting around and watched his every move carefully. He unpacked the bag, including a PDA looking device and layed it all on the table in plain view of his boys. “so whats it gonna do?” one of them say. “gunna make me sexy, and then the rest of you if you want” he said. Joulian was only 5'3  bulky in build, but not in the least bit toned, just bulk, very hairy and some acne, so stealing the device is his ticket to a new life. <br />
<br />
 He turned on the device and inserted a chip into himself behind his ear with a needle. Discomfort clear in his face his friends watch contently as they here the device beep. It takes a few minutes for it to scan out and find Joulians profile. Once found it shows a clear description of his body, shoe sz 7, penile sz 5 and even down to his pants size. Once he clicked the ok button it brought up a drop down menu, in which listed a number of different options, such as body modifications and even more specifically, it can transform someone into an exact person, just by searching that persons name and selecting the picture. He decided to search for celebrities and it pulled up a list of the top 10 list of most used celebrities and number one on the list was pro skateboarder Ryan Sheckler. Joulian immediately selected his picture and watched the device said “data transfer successful” he then felt an odd tingling engulf his body. <br />
 <br />
 His friends watch in awe as a clear look of uncertainty creeps along Joulian's face. The tingling turns into a numbing feeling and centers around his feet. Completely numbing them and putting  a pins and needles feeling. He looked down at his feet, watching his shoes literally melt away, leaving his socks to the same fate. His bare feet staring back at him, which soon began to expand and grow out. Inching there way outwards and gaining a tan color. When they stopped growing a pair of black socks materialized and stretched themselves over his feet, once settled a pair of black Etnies skate shoes wrapped around his feet. He stretched down to get a better view, pulling up the tongue and taking note of the size, which clearly reads a size 11. The numbness travels to his calves, which gained years worth of muscles, only acquired from years of skateboarding. His legs gain a tan as the hair falls out leaving his calves tan and smooth. His thighs lose every hair and remain just as pale as before, due to Ryan always wearing board shorts on the beach. The jeans he was once wearing, darkened in color and pulled closer to his body, becoming tight around his strong legs and around his equipment. The tag now clearly stating Diesel.<br />
<br />
 The feeling finally attacked his penis, he pulls down the newly tight jeans and watches his penis grow to its full 5 inches. Then in amazement it begins to grow, shooting out to two times its original size and most of his pubes pull in and become neatly trimmed blonde hairs. As fast as the numbing came it went, leaving his cock flaccid, as he trys to pull up the jeans he notices they are a lot tighter around his groin area, mostly due to the increased size to 11 inches long.<br />
<br />
 His stomach pulls inwards and tightens, forming a tight 6 pack, his lower back also tightens and gives him the perfect v shape. All the hair puling inward, leaving his abs with just a slight coating of blonde hairs, giving a barely noticeable treasure trail. His pecs shrink and tighten, no longer big and bulgy but  tight and defined. His upper back tightens and shows clear muscle definition. His arms engulf in numbness as they lose their bulk but show clear definition of his tight muscles. The once black hair coating completely gone and a tan spreads down, completely covers his arms and hands. The numbing feeling finally reaches his head, his hair turns dirty blonde and extends out and settles around his past ears. His eyes also take on a gorgeous green color, completely different from his once muddy brown color. He looks in the window of the room and notices his face, no longer his but that of Ryan Sheckler, the changes finish off as the tan covers the remaining pale parts of his body. <br />
<br />
 As soon as the changes finish Daryl bursts into the room, stunning all the guys with spray and grabbing  Joulian/Ryan and slamming him on the bed. Ripping his tight jeans off and leaving him sitting in only his wife beater. Daryl jumps onto Ryan and holds him down as he strokes his dick. Little known to Joulian that if you cum while in the transformed body, you will mentally turn into that person and seal your fate forever. As he strokes, Joulian notices that he can't straight and stops fighting and allows Daryl to do his deed. Ideas of Skateboarding fill his mind and erase everything there was about science and schoolwork. Making him only think thoughts of skating with his boys and sitting on the beach showing off his awesome body for all the ladies. His intellect completely dropping into half of what it used to be. Ideas of his name really being Ryan fill his mind as memories of skating and going to autograph signings fill his mind. All the ideas of his old life completely gone as now he remembers being Ryan Sheckler since birth. He shoots his load all over Daryl's  hand, making him smirk and walk out, leaving Ryan exhausted and confused. He gets dressed and runs out, finding his Mercedes in the driveway, he gets in and takes off, trying to forget about being raped by some dude.</p>
