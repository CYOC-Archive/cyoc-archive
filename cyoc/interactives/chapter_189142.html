<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam knew that he probably shouldn&#39;t feel this way toward Jackson. Least of all when he was supposed to be fucking around with Sasha. Even though he was undergoing his transformation, Sam still had more than enough of his old self to still feel aroused by her. But Jackson being around and in such a good condition seemed to provoke an odd reaction out of Sam.<br />
<br />
As for Jackson?<br />
<br />
He was having the time of his life lifting today. At first he needed to do more stretching than he had in some time, but he was quickly growing to like where he was at strength wise. Jackson did find himself wondering about that though as he did some squats, letting Sam sit back and watch how a man handled the weight. Not that Jackson noticed or really cared at this point how Sam was increasingly eyeing his back and his ass in a line of sight that might&#39;ve offered some hint as to what was going on.<br />
<br />
Being that the gym here lacked air conditioning, the jocks who used it didn&#39;t need to adhere to any policy about shirts. Hence, Jackson was here showing off his body with his shirt resting on his bag, his calloused hands gripping a bar outfitted with 275 lbs. It was a pretty good starting weight today. Sam however needed to take some of that weight off when Jackson got done at about 12 reps. <br />
<br />
It was stirring to watch, somehow. The way Jackson&#39;s crotch and glutes dipped toward the ground, and then pumped back up. Sam wondered if there might be something going on, but he dismissed it. Jackson was just being Jackson after all - and there was nothing wrong with that. The guys in here worked out shirtless and complimented one another&#39;s bodies all the time. Maybe Sam just...needed to relax.<br />
<br />
Jackson led the way over to the leg press once they were done with squats, and commenced putting five plates on each side.<br />
<br />
Sam stared as he watched Jackson get a feeling for the weight, aligning his legs and then stretching a bit - it seemed he needed to stretch a lot today - before starting the reps. Man Jackson&#39;s jaw looked strong and broad. Almost too broad and strong looking for a teenager to have. He was looking like a regular lantern jawed action movie hero. Sam felt his dick pulse, and gulped. He bit his lip and thought about other things - chasing his insurgent erection off using distraction.<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, Sam thought, need to be too distracted to be horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sam,&quot; Jackson said with a grin as he got up, &quot;Your turn. How many plates?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...just three!&quot; Sam answered, wiping off his forehead. If he was gonna look like a JPop Star, he couldn&#39;t be sweating these things. He had to show how calm, cool and sexy he was to everyone. Sam breathed and got on there once Jackson took two plates off. Smirking at his reflection and preening for himself, Sam took on the leg press exercise.<br />
<br />
He gulped as he felt his legs burn - never had it EVER felt that good just to do leg press. He really enjoyed feeling it go down, and then the stretch and flex in his legs as it went back up. Fight off the boner, Sam, he told himself, but it was getting harder to do so. Heh, harder. Sam fought through it as best he could, but by the time he finished 15 reps, he was half hard and out of breath - aroused and obviously so. He knew he could probably be seen this way...<br />
<br />
Jackson chuckled, &quot;You feeling good today, Sammy? I know legs can get pretty uhh, stirring. It&#39;s like, all the testosterone that gets produced when you hit legs. You just naturally get all worked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam felt a swooning reaction in his gut start when Jackson called him Sammy, but he suppressed it. Fuck, was he just tired today from waking up like that? Sam looked at Jackson climb on and do his own reps at the higher weight. Muscles in his legs pumping and almost seeming to grow as Sam watched. This turned his half hard into a full on erection sticking out awkwardly in his shorts. Sam&#39;s forehead was damp with sweat, and his shirt clung to his abs and his pecs - stiff nipples poking out.<br />
<br />
When Sam tried to get his shirt to stop clinging, he accidentally brushed a nipple and had to choke down a moan.<br />
<br />
Jackson however didn&#39;t even seem to mind what was going on over there with Sam as he got up once he got done with his set. He just figured that Sam was dealing with his hormones. Besides, Jackson figured, they were men here and doing something so tremendously manly. Of course the testosterone - a sex hormone after all - would flow freely. Jackson himself was starting to feel a slow increase in his arousal as the workout went on.<br />
<br />
Legs that day made for an awkward time as Sam watched enrapt as Jackson shattered PRs, whereas Sam seemed stuck where he was before. And what was more, even though Jackson looked older than he had when they went in - Sam swore he saw a tad more hair on his chest than earlier - he was also just as well looking better for it. Jackson wore this maturity with the greatest of ease.<br />
<br />
By the time they were done, Jackson and Sam both had their shirts off.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s eyes darted - from his own hairless, well toned torso to Jackson&#39;s beefy, incredibly well muscled physique. He swore Jackson&#39;s abs hadn&#39;t been that tight, turtle shell-like and built before, the obliques hadn&#39;t been so delineated and the pecs Jackson walked with forward were even broader than usual, matching strong shoulders. Sure there was a weathered look to him now, but Sam hardly minded. He just uhh, figured that Jackson looked great regardless. <br />
<br />
Maybe he needed some new moisturizer or something was all.<br />
<br />
&quot;You down to hit the showers, man? Fuck I need it.&quot; Jackson put a hand up behind his neck, subtly flexing his arm in the process.<br />
<br />
Sam immediately answered, &quot;Yeah! Yeah man...uhh, okay.&quot; Sam hadn&#39;t meant to sound that eager for it, but it seemed like Jackson didn&#39;t really care. The two of them swaggered out of the weight room and toward the men&#39;s locker room - which included a shower area near the back. Nobody was using it right now, which was good considering how erect Sam was by this point.<br />
<br />
As the two of them entered, Jackson chuckled, &quot;Damn it seems like all that leg work got you hyped up. You need a minute before you join me in the shower?&quot;</p>
