<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry rests on his back and closes his eyes. Desperate to ignore it all and get it out of his mind. Trying to resist all these urges but failing one by one. His nose focusing on his own musky pits and their rugged smell. His cock throbbing with need and leaking pre. His mind thinking of Zach and his new masculine might.<br />
<br />
Zach...<br />
<br />
Harry&#39;s eyes glance at the phone. Arguing with himself on whether he should or shouldn&#39;t call his friend. So many reasons and excuses emerging at once. It will be good to speak with him, Harry has only had his family to keep him company since the lockdown. But at the same time Zach is clearly different than he once was. He will try to convince Harry to be just like him, won&#39;t he? Harry&#39;s cock idly throbs. Just the idea of joining the rest of his family as a muscular stud is so appealing, but still so wrong. He knows it isn&#39;t right, but he can&#39;t get his mind off the idea... Maybe talking to Zach would help…<br />
<br />
His restraint lessens by the second as he reaches for his phone. Opening his messages with Zach and seeing the two nude pictures. Fuck... Zach&#39;s gotten so hot, so hairy, so rugged. Harry&#39;s heart skips a beat as he imagines himself with this brute of a man. Nose pressed against wet pits as he smells the result of a day’s work out. Head pillowed on those meaty pecs, safe and secure. Arms exploring the rest of the man, feeling each defined part of him. His tree trunk arms, his squared jaw and well-groomed beard, his thick cock standing tall and proud...<br />
<br />
Harry continues to hold the phone with one hand, the other now gripping his cock. Stroking it absently as he starts to dial Zach&#39;s number. Heavy with anticipation as each digit is put in. The full number ready as he hits dial, and waits. The phone only ringing once before being answered. Zach&#39;s voice greeting Harry. It&#39;s clearly his friends, still having that Irish accent. Yet there&#39;s something different, something more befitting the new Zach. Voice deeper and brimming with confidence, Harry can just hear the grin from the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you said you were going to bed.&quot;<br />
&quot;...Can&#39;t sleep.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Straight to the point as always, Zach really is the same bloke underneath it all. Though Harry isn&#39;t willing to tell the truth, it&#39;s beyond embarrassing to say he can&#39;t sleep because of a rock-hard cock. Worse if the reason for that is a fascination with his friend and family’s body and smell. Though... Zach&#39;s one of them now, he probably wouldn&#39;t see a problem with it now. Earlier he was sniffing his brothers used towel. Hell, he sent a picture of him doing it clearly erect. Still, it&#39;s way too embarrassing to-<br />
<br />
&quot;Thinking up an excuse?&quot;<br />
&quot;H-huh. Oh... uh...&quot;<br />
&quot;What? My pic got you rock hard.&quot;<br />
&quot;N-no it-&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t sound like a no to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Caught again, first by his brother and now by his friend. But it doesn&#39;t feel bad this time, in fact it&#39;s really nice. His friend knows and is cool with it. Harry&#39;s panic and reservation vanishing, his hand still stroking his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you caught me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah. Well, if you&#39;re hard just rub it out. Or do I have to teach you how to jerk it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Harry laughs, it&#39;s good talking with his friend after so long. Just like old times before all of this started, though a bit dirtier than usual. But there&#39;s no harm in that, it&#39;s good to be open after all. He jokes back,<br />
<br />
&quot;You a master at it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn straight. Let me teach you some lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
His phone display changes, Zach switching to a video call as his striking image is once more presented. On his bed, resting on his back and with phone held up by his right hand. Giving a good display of his friend’s chest and head, it&#39;s even more attractive than the picture. His left hand out of the shot but clearly in action, stroking his own prick as Zach makes an exaggerated grunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You turning your camera on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fear strikes Harry, he can&#39;t turn his camera on. He isn&#39;t anything like Zach or the rest of his family. No muscle on him, not a single drop of sweat had from a hard workout. He doesn&#39;t want to be judged but... at the same time, his friend hasn&#39;t judged him so far. With a bit of nervousness, he turns on the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... haven&#39;t really... changed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach looks confused for a few moments, before bursting out with laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, still scrawny. But don&#39;t worry, we can work on that. You want to work on it don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The thoughts been present since he &#39;sniffed and stroked&#39; with his brother. Everyone seems so happy after they worked out. So open and confident. Matt, Martin, and now Zach. He can&#39;t just keep saying no because of some ill-placed worry. He should embrace it and become something else, something better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. I&#39;d like to start working out.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit! Let’s start with something easy, getting yourself off&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach tilts the phone to show his hand and cock. Hearty and full strokes had, slow and calculated as they move up and down his thick pole. Harry practically drools as he looks at the throbbing cock. Watching as the pre drips into his forest of thick pubes. Fuck, he wants to just get right in that. Taking in the scent of hairs and spunk while rubbing his own cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;See that Harry? Mimic it. Hard and confident strokes, slow to start so you can enjoy it for longer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon. Show me how you&#39;re doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry tilts his own phone, showing his hand in the middle of a rub. His strokes faster than Zachs, less controlled but that is quickly fixed. Stopped as Zach directs him, using himself for reference as Harry relaxes and slows. Giving those same full and strategic strokes that his friend has mastered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it! Keep it up!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two groan and moan, bringing the image of their phones to their face and body once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, next part Harry. This is how you really enjoy getting off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry watches his friend with pure interest. Neither of them containing their gasps and moans, just giving in as Zach turns his head and faces his pits. Pressing himself against the thick strands of hair, sniffing his own stench and clearly enjoying it. Harry needing no more encouragement as he does the same. Taking a whiff of himself, of his sweaty underarm that reeks of delightful BO. The scent of a hardworking rowdy man hitting him in full force. Bringing to his mind the picture of what he will be. As big as Zach, as hairy as his family. A brute who works out and gives in to his butch needs. Yeah... it&#39;s gonna be a good life.<br />
<br />
Their groans become louder as their strokes escalate. The two completely lost now as they ignore the other and focus on themselves. Just giving in to the scent and lust. To the primal instincts that drives them. A few more throbs felt as the men release a loud grunt. Staining their bodies and sheets with a flood of spunk that only intensifies the perfect macho aroma already present. The two taking deep breaths as they relax and settle. Speaking to each other between pants and gasps. <br />
<br />
&quot;You enjoy your first workout?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell yeah I did!&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry laughs, oblivious to the fact that his voice has dropped an octave. Unaware that his chest and arms have started to sprout light hairs. Unmindful of the stubble on his now squared jaw. The two just enjoying each other’s company in silence as they rest. Taking in their partners form before Zach speaks up and starts to shuffle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna take this sheet to my brother, something to get him off tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, talk to you tomorrow?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, need to continue our training.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two grins as the call drops. Harry deciding to follow his friends lead once more as he strips his bed of its sheets. Hoisting it over his shoulder and walking to the longue room. Seeing his step-brother and step-father sitting by each other’s side on the couch. Watching the TV as they unwind for the day, and turn to face Harry. Looking over his naked form with a shared grin as Martin speaks up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Harry, you alright?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, better than alright honestly. Here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He throws the sheet to the two sitting men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something to help you get off tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks kid. You thought about working out with us tomorrow?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be there, joining the family fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;Proud to hear that Harry, it&#39;ll be good to have the three of us together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn straight it will! Still, you&#39;re shit out of luck Harry. Train all you want; you&#39;ll never be even half the man I am!&quot;<br />
&quot;We’ll see about that!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two brothers laugh at one another as they accept the challenge. Harry eventually saying good night and going back to his room. Head hitting the bed and body drifting to sleep. Exhausted from this wild day, and looking forward to tomorrow. To week three where he can finally be like the rest of his family and friends...</p>
