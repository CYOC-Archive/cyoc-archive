<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up in the same room, and saw nothing.  It was pitch black.  The only thing you could tell was that the altar was gone.  &quot;Well done.  You&#39;ve completed the ritual.  It&#39;s time for power to awaken in you!&quot;  A voice boomed, echoing through the whole room.  You couldn&#39;t tell if someone else was in the room, seeing how it was pitch black.  You were curious as to what he meant by awaken, until about 5 seconds after the thought popped into your head.  Inside of you, you felt a strange feeling.  It was almost like a wave of energy travelling through your whole body.  It started in your chest, and bubbled out, travelling through your whole body before dissipating at your head, feet and hands.  Once the energy disappeared, you wondered what happened.  Soon though, it became clear.  Pain erupted from your whole body, making you collapse onto the ground with an audible thud.  As you were writhing on the ground, screaming, you failed to notice the changes going on in your body.  It started with your muscles, becoming strong and toned.  After about a minute of growth, it stopped at fitness model proportions.  Strong, big (but not huge) and ripped.  The last thing to happen to your body was weird.  Your back started to hurt more than anything you&#39;ve ever experienced, as it felt like two things were being pushed out of your shoulder blades.  You couldn&#39;t see them, but two angelic wings formed on your back.  The difference was that these wings were black as night.  Next, your hair grew to be long, straight and flawless.  It also changed color, becoming silver.  Your eyes also changed, becoming terrifying glowing red eyes.  Your teeth straightened, and your canines grew much sharper and more lethal.  It finally ended with your body being clothed in black robes.  Once all of the physical changes were finished, the pain left.  However, a new sensation emerged, and it was arguably worse.  Your head felt like it was about to explode, as thousands of years of knowledge flooded into it, giving you intelligence rivaled only by God himself.  You knew almost everything.  Finally, the headache stopped, and a new intense burning sensation took its place.  You felt like your whole body was on fire, as magical and demonic power flooded into your body, creating the most powerful man on the planet.  Finally, all of the sensations ceased.  &quot;Rise, He who desired power.&quot;  You stood up, wondering who this voice was.  Despite the darkness, you could see perfectly fine now.  &quot;He who desired power, go and fulfill your purpose.&quot;  You smiled as you teleported out of the room, never to see it again.<br />
<br />
You appeared in your old house in an instant.  You felt fantastic.  Power coursed through your veins.  You felt like you could do anything.  However, you couldn&#39;t deal with your house.  It was small, filthy and proved your former pathetic existence.  You couldn&#39;t stand it.  You decided to do a little remodeling.  You tried tapping into your pool of power, and unleashed your power, changing your small house into a large mansion, complete with the highest quality everything someone could want.  &quot;Much better.&quot;  You laughed, realizing how powerful you truly were.<br />
<br />
You made your way to your bedroom, where a king sized bed was waiting for your larger body.  However, before you laid down, you decided to see what exactly you looked like.  You walked into your bathroom to look at yourself, and you were a sight to behold.  A body that could make anyone weep, beautiful, yet still badass hair, and your wings.  You finally noticed your wings.  You spread them out, hitting everything in the room.  &quot;Well, going to have to be careful with these.&quot;  You grinned, folding your wings back in.  You also noticed your red eyes, which even made you jump.  &quot;Okay, I can&#39;t go out in public like this.&quot;  You thought, trying to figure out how to blend in with the public.  You decided to just revert back to what you looked like pre-transformation, but a bit better looking.  More built, giving yourself an athletic build, and more handsome.  You also decided that your post-transformation form would be your &quot;true form&quot;, and this would be a disguise.  You were excited to see what else you could do, but you were tired.  It&#39;s been a long day, and you need sleep.  You walked back into your bedroom, and fell asleep on the large bed, eager to see what awaited you tomorrow.<br />
<br />
You woke up to the sound of birds chirping, bugs buzzing, and your stomach growling.  You were hungry, but this hunger felt very different.  You weren&#39;t hungry for food.  You wanted to eat souls.  At this point, you realized the &quot;purpose&quot; the voice in the cave was referring to.  Cleansing of evil.  You were to go out and feast on the souls of evil people in the world.  However, you couldn&#39;t feel the presence of any souls near you.  Rather than go out, you decided to make yourself a large breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon, toast and cereal.  Once you finished breakfast, you decided to see what exactly you could do.  So, you went into your basement, where a large gym was located.  You assumed your demonic form, which felt great to be back in.  You still had powers in your mortal form, but the power of this one made your other form look as powerless as a normal human.  You just knew you were immortal for some reason, but you wanted to see some other things.  Using your wings, you flew over to the bench press.  You loaded as much as you could onto the bar, which was 2 tons, laid under the bar, and saw if you could do it.  It was too easy.  In fact, you were worried that you would throw it through the roof considering how much force you put into lifting it.  The recoil from your first lift was also immense, making the 2 ton bar slam right into your chest.  Thankfully, that&#39;s how you discovered your immense durability.  It didn&#39;t hurt at all.  It felt light a light tap on your chest.  You accurately concluded that any physical aspect of a human was greatly multiplied by your power.  You decided to try out your agility by trying to fly through all of the equipment as fast as you could.  When you tried this, you noticed that you didn&#39;t hit anything.  You were happy knowing your power, but you wanted to know more.  You tried out some other things, including shapeshifting, manipulation of fire and other elements, and some scary demonic stuff.  You also learned that you could create anything out of thin air.  You did this to create money for yourself.  You were now incredibly rich, powerful, and hungry.  When you left your gym, you noticed your hunger.  Your large breakfast wasn&#39;t enough.  You needed souls.  Thankfully, you could start sensing some now.  You felt one particularly evil soul about 14 miles away.  &quot;Perfect.&quot;  You grinned a seemingly evil grin.  &quot;I&#39;ve found a worthy meal.&quot;  You walked onto your balcony, breathing in the fresh autumn air, turned yourself invisible with a snap of your fingers, and flew off into the distance.<br />
<br />
The 14 mile journey took less than 20 seconds.  (That calculates to approx 3000 MPH)  When you reached your destination, you noticed your target walking along the road.  It was about 7PM, too early to be committing crimes for a smart criminal.  However, you could tell this guy wasn&#39;t smart.  With your demonic powers, you could tell what this man&#39;s every move will be.  He was going to walk around the corner, brandish a knife and rob a woman at gunpoint.  You were not going to let this happen.  Again, using some demonic powers, you diverted his path into an empty alley, and had him stop at a dead end.  &quot;Whoops, must have been a wrong turn.&quot;  He said confusedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t.&quot;  You said, landing and blocking his escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was that?&quot;  He asked, seeing nothing.  You snapped your fingers, making yourself visible again.  The man screamed in fear, confirming your appearance&#39;s terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your first of many nightmares.&quot;  You laughed as your hand erupted into a mass of black energy.  &quot;Goodbye scum.&quot;  You rushed towards him, making contact with your black hand.  Immediately, his body was enveloped in black, evil energy.  He screamed as his body disappeared from existence, ending up in hell.  The only thing left of him was a baseball sized red orb.  &quot;My first soul.  I wonder what it&#39;ll taste like.&quot;  You smiled as you grabbed the floating orb and shoved it into your mouth.  It tasted just like the liquid you drank in the chalice, heavenly.  However, this wasn&#39;t enough.  You needed more souls.  You craved them.  Luckily, you sensed one coming right behind you.  He saw nothing, and couldn&#39;t see any of your demonic features because of the darkness.  He was creeping slowly, with a knife drawn.  &quot;This should be fun.&quot;  You thought to yourself, making a slight chuckle.  The knife man was about 5 feet away from you, and you knew his soul would be good.  Unlike the last one, which just had a couple of robberies, this one had 3 murders.  The man continued edging closer, trying not to be heard.  To bad your heightened senses helped you hear everything, including his footsteps, heartbeat, and blinks.  He was only a couple of inches away, meaning that he was about to stab you.  Sure enough, you were right, and you felt a poke on your back.  The man tried to stab you in the back, but the knife shattered instead.  &quot;You know, trying to kill an immortal is not very smart.&quot;  You grinned as you turned around.  The failed murderer was terrified, eyes locked with your red irises.  &quot;Your soul is mine.&quot;  You grinned as you stabbed him with your hand.  Despite the lack of sharpness your hand possessed, it went directly through his body, killing him instantly.  As you tried to remove the corpse from your arm, you opened a crack in the ground.  Once the body was removed, you dropped it into the abyss, sending it to hell.  From the crack flew out another red soul.  You were able to correlate each soul to the circle of hell they were going to, since each circle corresponded to a specific sin.  The red ones were wrathful souls.  Speaking of the red ones, you took this one in your hand, and decided to play with it.  It had a strange texture to it.  Smooth and squishy, like a gummy candy.  But it also felt dense.  No matter how much force your extremely strong body exerted on it, it would return to its spherical shape.  Rather than swallowing this one whole, you took a single bite out of it.  It felt like eating a spherical gummy bear, and tasted sweeter than the last.  You figured that the more evil a soul, the sweeter it will be for your demonic taste buds, and the more it will fill you up.  Once you finished your leisurely munching of a human soul, you sensed a different evil.  Feeling like you had room for one more, you flew in the direction of this soul.<br />
<br />
When you found it, you noticed that it was in a building.  Using more demonic powers, you flew through the wall of the building and continued your search.  Eventually, you reached the apartment of a young woman.  You could sense that the soul was on the other side of the door, and that she was a rapist and thief.  She would seduce rich men, bring them to this room, drug them, rape them and steal their wallets.  You already thought of how to deal with her.  You changed back into your mortal form, and made yourself look much richer, giving yourself a nice suit and a Rolex watch.  You knocked on her door, and waited.  You knew she was expecting someone she met online, and that she&#39;s never seen a picture of him.  After about one minute, she opened the door.  She was wearing a nice dress, and more perfume than your enhanced nose could take.  You sneezed from the stench, but played it off as an allergy.  &quot;So, ready to go?&quot;  You asked confidently, trying to make yourself look like the perfect victim for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was thinking that we could just stay in tonight.&quot;  She smiled sweetly.  Unfortunately for her, you knew exactly what was behind that smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  You agreed, playing along.  &quot;Should I take off my shoes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want.&quot;  She replied.  &quot;Would you like anything to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vodka tonic, if you have.&quot;  You answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly, let me just get it.&quot;  She walked away, presumably to her kitchen, where she prepared the drink, and dissolved a drug that knocks people out and messes up their memories.  That&#39;s how she&#39;s been getting away with it.  She came back after a minute with drinks in her hand.  &quot;Vodka tonic for you, and a screwdriver for me.&quot;  You took the drink and drank it.  You could taste the drug, despite it being tasteless, and could tell that it was supposed to knock you out in 15 minutes.  You stalled for those 15 minutes, waiting for the opportune moment.  The drug wouldn&#39;t affect you, but you&#39;d pretend.<br />
<br />
After 15 minutes, you pretended to feel dizzy, and feigned unconsciousness, fooling the woman.  &quot;Henry?&quot;  She yelled, trying to see if the drug worked.  You gave absolutely no response.  &quot;Henry!&quot;  She yelled again, slapping you in face a couple of times.  Still no response.  &quot;Perfect.&quot;  She smiled, dragging you into her bedroom.   She started taking everything you had on your person, starting with your watch, then your phone, and finally your wallet.  Then, she started taking your clothes off.<br />
<br />
When she got to your pants, she noticed that she was having an unusually hard time with your belt.  &quot;Oh, your not getting that off.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;In fact, you won&#39;t be doing anything ever again.&quot;  You laughed as you &quot;woke up&quot;, standing and changing into your demonic form.  You raised your hand, and everything that she&#39;d touched of yours gained a black aura.  Then, they began to attack.  First, your tie wrapped around her mouth, acting as a gag.  Next, your suit jacket and shirt tied around her body, making her unable to move.  Next, your wallet flew into her face, breaking her nose and fracturing her skull.  Your phone then followed suit, cracking her skull even more.  Finally your watch dissolved into black smoke.  &quot;Goodbye.&quot;  You laughed as the black smoke entered through every opening of her body.  You watched as her body started to disappear, and could hear her muffled screams.  &quot;The screams of mortals fuel my inner joy.&quot;  Soon, only her head remained.  You decided to stop the dissolution of her body, and left her head for you to finished off yourself.  You grabbed it in one hand, and crushed it like an egg.  Blood, bone fragments and brain chunks exploded through the room.  You used your powers to take all of these, and made a small red ball of blood.  &quot;These powers are more and more fun by the minute.&quot;  You smiled as you solidified the blood ball, and dropped into a small hole you made to the underworld.  Once the ball was out of sight, her soul appeared from the hole.  This one was different.  While still the same size and texture, it was a different color.  This one was a green and pink swirl.  You could tell this one was greed and lust.  You deduced that the pink was the lust, and the green was greed.  You grabbed the floating soul, and ate it whole.  This one tasted different.  It tasted more like a chocolate covered pretzel:  Sweet and Salty.  It was delicious, and your appetite was finally satisfied.  You smiled, knowing that the night&#39;s work was done, and flew home.</p>
