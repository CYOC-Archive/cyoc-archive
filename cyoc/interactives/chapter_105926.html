<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John is escorted by an deputy to where his mother is currently being held. The entire holding area reeks of stale beer and bile. Both he and the deputy turn their noses up in disgust.<br />
“I’ll give you some time. But the Sheriff is finishing up the paperwork to have your mother transferred. Try and be quick. “The deputy tells him while walking back to the entrance. <br />
<br />
John walks down the corridor of empty cells. There is a chair in front of the far one. The same chair Sheriff Cooper used when talking to a hungover Cathy earlier in the morning. John sits down and stares at a bedraggled woman in her late forties. Despite being a were; alcohol abuse has taken its toll on her. Gone was the knockdown, drag out gorgeous blond bombshell that John Sr. married. In its place is a frail woman, with sunken eyes, hollow cheeks and thinning grey hair. If she was ever in her fursona; she would look like a werewolf with mange. John Jr looks at her emotionless. Its then that Cathy finally speaks up.<br />
<br />
“What do you want,” She snaps.<br />
“I came to see you,” John responds. “Also; to get some truth from you for a change.” John shows his mother the newspaper clipping detailing his father’s death. “You lied to me!” He screams. “You told me dad ran out on us! Why?”<br />
<br />
Cathy is silent for a moment. Looking at her son, she stands up. “I didn’t lie. I just omitted certain facts.”<br />
“Oh really,” John snaps. “Please explain.”<br />
“Your father spent more time working his cases then he did spending time with us!” Cathy snaps back. “Yes we had issues! Yes we had fights! I’m sure when you talk to your aunt she will most likely corroborate everything you were just told. But he did leave us!” Cathy continues. “I needed him. But he wouldn’t come home. I begged him to get a transfer. Tried to get him to spend time with you; but he took his job a little too seriously.” Cathy calms down and looks right in her son’s eyes. “The day before he died he finally told me he put in for a transfer. ‘It’ll be a few days he said’.” Seeing the article that John held, “then that.”<br />
<br />
“So getting besotted night after night is you way of dealing with it?” John Asks<br />
“It wasn’t every night.” Cathy sits back down in here cell. “You want to know why there are no photos of your dad, John?” She looks up “It’s because you are his spitting image. And it sickens me that I see his face in you. That is why there are no photos.”<br />
“What about his belongings? His medals, his commendations? “John asks. “Did you throw all that out as well?”<br />
“Talk to your aunt about that,” Cathy answers. “Now if you are not here to bail me out, then just get on out of here.”<br />
<br />
John considered letting his mom know about the insurance benefits and his father’s pension waiting for him but decided to not tell her. Getting up, He remarks, “time and time again Aunt Beth and I have tried to get you the help you need. But you have refused every single time.” John continues “I’m done with you. Your lies, your problems; I’m not dealing with it anymore.”<br />
<br />
John walks away to his mother sobbing in her cell. Grabbing his phone he texts, <br />
‘Need to talk to you. It’s important. Sheriff Cooper told me about my father.’ <br />
John sends the message to his Aunt and leaves the police station and heads to his after school job.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Martin Stovall leaves the Sheriff’s office just a Julie was finished being processed. Looking sullen handcuff to a chair, Julie doesn’t notice her father staring at her.<br />
“Julie,” Martin says.<br />
She looks up, seeing her father stare at her. She sees the disappointment in his eyes. His own daughter booked like a common thug. ‘Why couldn’t he use his powers as mayor to make all this go away? How dare he let this happen,’ she thinks.<br />
<br />
A deputy comes by to give Martin instructions on the ankle bracelet. “Any attempt to remove the bracelet with tools or Julie transforming into her fursona will result in an alarm going off.” The deputy continues. &#39;It’s completely water proof and there is enough give to allow the removal of socks and pants.” The deputy hands Martin a small bag. “Here is the receiver. The bracelet must be within one hundred feet or an alarm will go off. When you get home you must plug it in a wall outlet. Any will do.” Looking at Julie, the deputy finally adds. “If the receiver is unplugged or not getting power, an alarm goes off.”<br />
<br />
Martin looks at the device and the Julie. “Are we done here?”<br />
“For the time being yes,” States the deputy. “The town’s prosecutor will call in a few days to let you know when Julie is expected at court.” The deputy removes the Handcuffs from the chair and then Julie.<br />
<br />
Martin looks at Julie. “Now we are going straight home.” He continues as they both walk out the door. “Do not think you can pull another stunt like you did last night.” Martin referencing Julie’s failed attempt to have fun with her now ex-boyfriend Brian Walker and Alyssa.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sheriff Cooper was just finishing the paperwork for Cathy’s transfer when a state trooper arrives. “I’m here to take Cathy Shaffer into custody Sheriff.”<br />
“One moment,” Comments the Sheriff. He finally adds his signature to the final document and hand the trooper his copy. “Follow me please.”<br />
<br />
The sheriff guides the trooper to the holding cells. On their way there, they run into John as he was leaving. Nodding to John, Knowing he had a chance to talk to his mother; they silently pass each other. Reaching the cells, they Cathy sobbing. “Clearly the talk John had with his mom, had the desired effect,” he thinks.<br />
<br />
“Okay Cathy it’s time to go.” The Sheriff speaks as he unlocks the cell. “The state trooper here is going to escort you to the county jail in Seattle.”<br />
Sheriff Cooper steps aside as the trooper enters to take custody.  Handcuffing Cathy they all leave the holding cell. Sheriff Cooper tells one of his deputies to air the place out as they leave. Observing the trooper place Cathy in the back of the cruiser, the sheriff heads back to his office. Noting the time he decides to call it a day and shortly heads home himself.</p>
