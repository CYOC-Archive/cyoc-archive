<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You awaken slowly from your drugged induced sleep. You know that you're lying flat on your back and you're completely naked. You try to sit up but can't. You wonder why since you can't feel any restraints holding you down. You try moving your fingers and discover that you can't move them. You can feel them but they don't respond. You're starting to get scared and your heart beats a little faster. You try to open your eyes but are unable to do so.<br />
<br />
From somewhere on your right a voice says &quot;Brain wave activity indicates that the subject is awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; a familiar voice said from somewhere by your feet. It takes you a few seconds to place it but you recognize it as belonging to the guy in the park. &quot;Now open his eyes so he can witness what is about to happen to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heart starts to race as you start to panic. You're convinced that you're about to be tortured. From somewhere above your head you hear a female voice say &quot;Subjects heart rate is increasing dramatically doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better administer a mild sedative then Dr. Thurdoe&quot; the guy from the park said. &quot;We don't want any adverse affects. I'm sure he doesn&quot;t want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Thurdoe laughed and said &quot;I know I wouldn't.&quot; Then with concern in his voice he asks &quot;Are you sure he can handle what he's going to be going through Mr. Mackenroe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter if he can or not&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;He's a terrorist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Dr. Thurdoe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's been saying things about our new president&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;we also have evidence that he's been planning an attack. My superiors want him out of the picture but don't want him dead. This is just one way to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like it&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said. &quot;Does he even know what's going to happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get on with your work doctor&quot; Mr. Makenroe said. &quot;If you don't I can aways find someone else and you will share the same fate as our subject. Do I make myself clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said. &quot;I'll do it but that doesn't mean I have to like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care if you like it or not&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;Now administer the sedative and open his eyes!&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel a needle puncture your skin and within a few moments your heartbeat slows down. You're still terrified but your body isn't responding like you are. You feel something being placed on your eyelids and your eyes are gently opened. The light is turned down low so it doesn't hurt your eyes. There is enough light to see yourself in a mirror hanging above you. You were indeed naked and laying on some sort of table.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mackenroe entered your field of vision and said &quot;The mirror is so you can watch what happens to you. You really need to watch it. I like to see the look of horror in the subjects eyes during the procedure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to start with?&quot; Dr. Thurdoe asked.<br />
<br />
You're afraid of what they were going to do. You thought that they were going to torture you until Mr. Mackenroe said &quot;Let's start with the age regression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Thurdoe injected something into you and you feel a warmth spread throughout your body. You didn't think it was possible but you're even more scared now than you were before. You think 'What the -FUCK- did he put in me? And what did they mean by age regression?' Soon you can see what they meant as your body hair starts to thin and you start shrinking. You had developed a slight gut after you graduated from high school and now it melted away. You start shrinking now as you get younger. When you reach thirteen all your body hair is gone though you still have a little pubic hair. That quickly goes away as you hit eleven. At last you hit six years old and your a bit dismayed that your penis and testicles are small while your testicles are tight against your body. The warm feeling leaves your body and you shiver a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Age regression complete&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said. &quot;Final age of subject is six years of age. Do you want to take this further Mr. Mackenroe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I do&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want to do next?&quot; Dr. Thurdoe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should change his gender now&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said.<br />
<br />
Dr. Thurdoe again injects something into you and you again feel your body get warm. You see that you shrink a little more and your hair is growing longer. You think that your face changes slightly but you can't tell if it did or not. What you can see is your penis shrinking even further. You watch in horror as it shrinks down to a little nub and your testicles pull up into your body. You can see folds of skin develop but you can't see your new vagina form. You can however feel an uncomfortable shifting in your lower abdomen as your insides shift to accommodate your new gender. The warm feeling leaves your body and you again shiver. You know that you're a girl now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transgender complete&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said. &quot;Final gender of subject is female. Any more modifications Mr. Mackenroe?&quot; Dr. Thurdoe asked this in a bitter tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like your tone doctor&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;I would be very careful if I were you. Now I want her hair to be medium length and blond. Her eyes should be blue and her height should be forty-four inches. Think you can do that doctor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said in a bitter tone.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mackenroe said nothing as Dr. Thurdoe injected you with something again. This time you didn't feel any warmth but you could see that your hair was getting lighter until it was blond. You're injected with something again and your hair grows a little longer until it looks like it's end will hit your mid-back. Another injection and your eyes change to blue. Another one and you feel the warmth this time and you watch as you shrink just a little more. The warm feeling leaves your body and you shiver but this time you also pee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you'll need to be wiped before we put you in your new clothes&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;She looks good doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Body modification complete&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said. &quot;Final stats for subject; medium length blond hair, blue eyes, and final height of forty-four inches. Are you done with her now Mr. Mackenroe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one more modification&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;I want you to partially block her memories so she knows who she was in a dream like way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you want a complete memory block?&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she was a terrorist&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;This way she will know terror herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't mean to do that?&quot; Dr. Thurdoe asked in a shocked tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I do&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said with a slight maniacal edge to his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never would have agreed to do this procedure if I had known that&quot; Dr. Thurdoe said outraged. &quot;I though you were going to put her back into society with amnesia. I won't allow this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not in a position to allow anything&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;You are going to be sharing her fate now. I hope you'll be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of your eye you see Dr. Thurdoe fall to the floor. Next you see Mr. Mackenroe enter your field of vision as he says &quot;Get another doctor in here nurse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right away Mr. Mackenroe&quot; the nurse said and left.<br />
<br />
Mr. Mackenroe looked at you and said &quot;This is what you get for being a terrorist. Perhaps you'll learn a lesson from this. We might rescue you sometime in the future and place you someplace else as a little girl. I've been given orders to make sure you never carry out the attack you were planning.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're confused about this. You hadn't been planning any attack and you're certainly not a terrorist. You begin to think about what your fate could be. Dr. Thurdoe was definitely upset about it. It hits you like a bolt of lightning out of the blue. You're now a blue-eyed blond-hair six year old girl. It looks like you might be given to a pedophile ring.<br />
<br />
A new voice said &quot;I understand you needed another doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; Mr. Mackenroe said. &quot;I want this girl's memory partially blocked so she still remembers her previous life but in a dream like quality. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh most definitely&quot; the doctor said.<br />
<br />
The doctor injected you with something and your heart starts racing again. Everything seems to blur and your mind feels like it's in a fog. Your memories are already taking on a dream like quality. With your last clear thought of your old life you wonder what was going to happen next.</p>
