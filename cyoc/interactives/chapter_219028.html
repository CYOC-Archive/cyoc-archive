<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“He really didn’t let you be on top?” asked Astaroth as she lounged in the more laid-back section of the massive party of the noblest of the noble of the nobility of Hell. She was lying back on a series of pillows not even paying attention to a couple of dukes going at each other in the total nude a couple of feet away. She was too busy, her lost love finally back with her formally the human Rebecca Church now the <br />
Demoness Atargatis. She could tell that Atargatis was getting tired, and how could she fault her, it had been one hell of a day.<br />
<br />
In the morning she had been the broken and beaten housewife of a horrible man and now she was lying on a sea of cushions with her head resting on the bare stomach of a Demon Mistress of Hell who was playing with her hair around her new horns. Her body had been transformed into one hell of a demon, which Astaroth couldn’t wait to have fun with her son had become an Angel and then to make matters worse she had seen her daughter almost die before her eyes only to be saved by the combination of demonic and angelic magic. <br />
<br />
“It was only the missionary position with him, everything else was sinful and against God’s will.” Stated Atargatis as she heard Astaroth roll her eyes at that, a few other demons and demoness who were nearby and relaxing with drinks or just talking rolled their eyes at that as well. “He did allow blow jobs and hand jobs but that was because it promoted a man’s proper place over a woman.”<br />
<br />
“That SOB.” Stated a nearby demon who was clearly with child, that was why she was over her lounging instead of out on the dance floor area where Rachel, Maisy, Maisy’s cousins and the “younger” demons were. They were grinding against each other in ways that would have been horrifying to anyone who wasn’t a demon. “Such sexist ideas, and you went along with this?”<br />
<br />
“Sadly yes.” admitted Atargatis “It was what was drilled into my head by my own parents. I assume they are down here somewhere?”<br />
<br />
“Somewhere, almost everyone comes down here. Some for a few years or even days depending on their sins others will never leave again.” stated Astaroth “I could have their information looked up if you want?”<br />
<br />
“Not really.” Stated Atargatis “They weren’t as horrible as my ex-husband, just backward thinkers for the most part. They wouldn’t have let me study music if they were like him.”<br />
<br />
“What does music have to do with anything?” inquired another demon<br />
<br />
“Music, is only to be performed in honor of God and only heavenly approved music and musical instruments.” Repeated Atargatis “Only gossip music and certain instruments where banded, of course it was most of the ones I loved playing. I haven’t touched a violin in years.”<br />
<br />
She remembered sitting a music hall of the college she was pretending to go attend to search for love when she first meet Rebecca. She had played the violin in a way she had never heard of in all the years she had been alive and she began to fall in love with her then and there.<br />
<br />
In that moment Astaroth promised herself, she would get her soon to be wife a violin, she didn’t care which master she had to lighten their sentence in hell to get one made. Hell, she could reach out to Michael and get one crafted in Heaven if the best had already gone there. <br />
<br />
“Fool, God has given more pardon’s to musicians then any other type of job.” Said the Pregnant Demon “He loves music.”<br />
<br />
“I just hope my ex is caught soon and is sentenced to the harsh punishment possible.” Stated Atargatis <br />
<br />
“You should make him watch you marry our Princess there.” Laughed at another demon. <br />
<br />
“Or worse, have him watch me doing the Princess on top none the less.” countered Atargatis as the court officials nearby all burst out laughing. <br />
<br />
“Astaroth, you got yourself a winner with this one.” Stated a nearby demon. <br />
<br />
“I certainly do.” Confirmed Astaroth “Only question is which would horrifying him more, watching you on top of me as the sire or you riding me as the sire?”<br />
<br />
“The what?” asked Atargatis confused<br />
<br />
“Ah…yes, I forgot it is still your first day.” Stated Astaroth slightly concerned that it would freak her wife out. “Part of the wedding ceremony is deciding who is going to the sire for any children, once one is decided they grow a penis until a child is conceived then it goes away. Whenever we decide to have more, we can go back and have that part of the ceremony redone and switch places if we want.”<br />
<br />
Atargatis grinned as she considered which put Astaroth’s heart at ease. <br />
<br />
“I must admit, I like girls a lot more then boys but if it is your dick in me not my self centered ex or my dick in you…well that sounds like a lot of fun.” Stated Atargatis as Astaroth let out a sigh of relief. <br />
<br />
“Good, I was concerned about that.” Admitted Astaroth<br />
<br />
“My only concern is how will my son Josh react to that? I am sure Rachel knows about this part of the ceremony?” inquired Atargatis, she didn’t know if Angels did this ceremony or not but any son would freak out at that. “I would like him there for the wedding itself, I assume since we can repeat that part of the ceremony that they can be split up<br />
<br />
“I haven’t thought of that.” Admitted Astaroth “I don’t see why not, they are normally separated anyhow, with the Sire ceremony happening after one great of a party at the end of the whole wedding ceremony in general. Kind of like a last dance before the couple go out on their honeymoon.”<br />
<br />
“Makes sense.” Stated Atargatis<br />
<br />
“We have to find a place to have the wedding, traditions demand that we get married within 7 days and that is the same in heaven for Josh and Penemue wedding. That will cause a lot of scheduling problems and I will not be welcomed in Heaven and having Angels in Hell isn’t welcomed all that much either.” stated Astaroth<br />
<br />
“I do need to go to my son’s wedding.” stated Atargatis, that was totally understandable to both angels and demons alike. “Maybe a double or triple wedding with Rachel and Maisy’s wedding.”<br />
<br />
“Could work, but Penemue will want all her sisters and brothers there and most of the court of Heaven and the wedding of the heir to all of Hell will draw the entire court of hell.” Stated Astaroth <br />
<br />
“What about purgatory?” inquired Atargatis “Isn’t that basically neutral land? Ruled by a son of lucifer and a daughter of God?”<br />
<br />
“It is.” Confirmed Astaroth as considered, Lucifer would like it and it would help build links between Heaven and Hell to strength the peace deal. No one who fought in the war would ever totally forgive the other side, but there was a sort of respect between them. “It would be a risk, but it makes sense. We could even have Thanatoes (death) preside over ours and Maisy’s and Rachel’s wedding and Jeventas can preside over Penemue’s and Josh’s wedding.”<br />
<br />
“Why would that matter?” inquired Atargatis <br />
<br />
“They are pretty much the popes of the faiths of Heaven and Hell.” Explained Astaroth “Thanatoes is the head Priest of the Faith of the Darkness which all demons follow. Even Lucifer has to take Thanatoes words with great weight, but Thanatoes doesn’t bother himself with court affairs, he stays out of it. Just like Jeventas stays out of the affairs of the court of Heaven even as she is the leader of the Church of the Light and even God consider her requests with great care. Neither God nor Lucifer have to follow their words to the letter but their words carry great weight with the average citizen of Heaven and Hell, so they have to as well.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Stated Atargatis “Something to ask Lucifer, where is he?”<br />
<br />
“Having a meeting with all the leaders of the nine layers. I should be there, but it is my wedding party afterall.” stated Astaroth “Why don’t we ask your daughter and my niece if this idea works for them and we can track down my brother.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good.” Said Atargatis as she stood up and stretched a bit. “Maybe afterwards we can go back to your place?”<br />
<br />
“No, we can go back to our place.” Countered Astaroth</p>
