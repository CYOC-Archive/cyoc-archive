<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Henry! We&#39;re coming in!&quot; Richard said as he came back inside. &quot;Pee-Yew, someone made a stinky!&quot; Richard covered his nose as he moved towards. &quot;I couldn&#39;t help it... I needed to go...&quot; he said, looking red in the face. Richard had positioned his asshole to be above the seat, so he could at least not soil his butt. That was his gift to Henry, or so he called it. &quot;I&#39;ll get Alan to clean up, but first let me show you something. Alan!&quot; Richard shouted for Alan to come in. A few second later, the door opened again. &quot;Allow me to introduce you to the newest member of our family! Ta-dah!&quot; Alan came in and with him a dog on a leash. Henry started at her for a few seconds and realized in horror who it was. &quot;You didn&#39;t?!&quot; &quot;I did! Say hello to our golden retriever, Andrea!&quot; The dog that was once his wife came up to him and sniffed his tiny dick. &quot;Andrea! Oh god! What have they done to you?!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t bother talking to her Dad. We made sure she has the mind of any old dog.&quot; Richard said. &quot;We?&quot; Henry asked, looking at Alan. &quot;Hee-hee. Guilty as charged!&quot; he replied sheepishly. &quot;How could you, Alan?! To your own mother!&quot; &quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t like we were left with any other choice. We needed to keep this secret now. And I didn&#39;t want poor Mommy to live knowing her family was different.&quot; Henry looked at Alan and the bulge in his pants. &quot;You two are insane!&quot; was all he could say. &quot;Well, then your not gonna like what we decided next.&quot; Alan said. &quot;What are you talking about now?&quot; Henry asked. Richard answered. &quot;Well we have two big twin brothers here and a little brother to dot on. Plus a dog to call our own. So what is missing?&quot; &quot;Gasp... You don&#39;t mean...&quot; &quot;Yep, we need a Mommy and Daddy of our very own!&quot; Alan replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You... You&#39;re crazy! Who are you?!&quot; But before he could ask, the doorbell rang. &quot;Oh, they&#39;re here!&quot; Alan said as he raced down the stairs. &quot;You can&#39;t believe how hard it was to get theme to come here on their own, but with some wishes to their parents, we got them! Henry heard the door open and two voices, a young girl and boy, talking to Alan. &quot;Wow! It&#39;s really true!&quot; the girl said. &quot;Dude! This is totally wicked!&quot; the boy replied. Henry could swear he heard them before. The three came running up the stairs and through the door. &quot;Richie! I brought them!&quot; &quot;Wow! Is that you Rich?! You look really good!&quot; the boy said. It was Richard&#39;s friend from school, Mike Harland. &quot;And this must be...&quot; Mike moved towards Henry and eyed him. He looked down and flicked his dick. &quot;Ow! That hurts!&quot; &quot;He&#39;s real!&quot; Mike exclaimed. &quot;Is it really you, Mr. Simmons?! You look so little!&quot; &quot;And this must be Mommy Simmons!&quot; the girl said as she went to pet the dog. It was Alan&#39;s friend and crush, Cindy Heisman. &quot;She looks so well trained for a human turned dog.&quot; &quot;What can I say. The app is strong stuff!&quot; Richard replied. &quot;So we can really be adults?!&quot; Mike asked. &quot;Sure thing!&quot; Alan replied. &quot;Wait! WAIT! What&#39;s going on here?!&quot; &quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry Daddy Simmons! Gosh, you must be so confused. Well, when I got a text from Alan saying he had a app that could grant wishes, I was really shocked. Like no way!&quot; &quot;I thought Rich was trying to scam me or something. But then he did something I never thought possible. He made our parents not care if we went outside.&quot; &quot;My parents are really strict, so only an app that grants wishes could make that happen. And then he told me what he wanted and I&#39;m really curious.&quot; &quot;Yeah! To be a Dad?! What could be better?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Henry said. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; &quot;I admit, I&#39;m a little scared, but being a mom seems pretty cool if my Mom is anything to go by.&quot; Cindy replied. &quot;So are we gonna do this now or what?&quot; Mike asked impatiently. &quot;Take it easy.&quot; Richard replied. &quot;First we need to make sure no one is suspicious of us. So we need to wish that we are all related to each other.&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; Henry said. &quot;Oh yeah! Would want our parents to think we went missing!&quot; Cindy said. &quot;Is that all?! Of course we&#39;ll take it!&quot; Mike added. &quot;Good! In that case I&#39;ll make the wish. &quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Henry said. He knew there would be no turning back from this. &quot;Richie! Alan! I thought you wanted power. You can&#39;t do that if Mike and Cindy are your parents.&quot; &quot;What?! Is that all?! We&#39;re 20 year olds, Henry! I don&#39;t think we need to listen too our parents!&quot; Richard said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. &quot;We already gave them our word that we wouldn&#39;t mess with them. We just want to raise one kind, and that&#39;s you!&quot; Mike said. &quot;Besides, Alan is the only one who can use the app. We can&#39;t stop them from doing what they want.&quot; Cindy added. &quot;No... No way...&quot; Henry said. His last avenue to changing this was gone. &quot;It&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t realize this before we transformed you Daddy, but we can&#39;t turn back now.&quot; Alan said like it was only natural. Considering he had a crush on Cindy, Henry at least thought he might object. &quot;Well now that we... well the only people who matter anyway... have decided on it, let&#39;s go!&quot; Richard said as he pointed to Alan. &quot;Here goes nothing! I wish that everyone in the world thinks the people in this room are a family, except for the people in this room!&quot; Ten seconds passed and with it a flash of light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing feels different.&quot; Mike said as the light died down. &quot;Not exactly. Look at your phone!&quot; Cindy said. Mike took it out and realized he no longer had his parents&#39; numbers. Alan and Richard were now listed as his sons and Henry and Cindy were added as Son and Wife respectively. &quot;Cool!&quot; he said. &quot;I guess we&#39;re ready to go then?&quot; Cindy added. &quot;If we&#39;re all good?&quot; Alan asked looking at Richard. &quot;Yep! But first, we have to decide what age the two of you will be.&quot;</p>
