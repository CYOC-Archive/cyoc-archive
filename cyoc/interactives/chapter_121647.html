<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Okay folks, let&#39;s get started on our next millennia of episodes!—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Jack Crawford did not like being cooped up in a jail cell.<br />
Then again, who did?<br />
The fact that he was in solitary confinement on Federal matters allowed him the freedom to pace back and forth in his small cell, but common sense kept him from assuming his werepanther fursona, let alone trying to break out in that form.<br />
<i>The Elders will get me out of here soon if they know what&#39;s good for them,</i> was the smug and confident thought running through his brain.<br />
Crawford was happy to see his lawyer return, although he&#39;d never let the other man know that. &quot;How&#39;s my wife?&quot; was the first question out of his mouth when the attorney drew near the cell bars.<br />
&quot;Fine, as far as I know. I called my firm and they sent a female lawyer to keep her company and advise Mrs. Crawford on what to and not say. She&#39;s still talking to an Agent Reed right now,&quot; explained Jacoby Albertson, Attorney at Law.<br />
&quot;I wanted her home, safe and sound,&quot; growled Crawford.<br />
&quot;I know you did, but while they&#39;ve been nice to her so far, the Feds are playing hard ball here about Parker and the dead deputy, so don&#39;t you think it&#39;s best not to antagonize them?&quot;<br />
Crawford thought about that for a moment before admitting the attorney was right. &quot;What about that... request I asked you for?&quot;<br />
Albertson looked around, before moving a step closer to the cell. They were still being watched by posted guards and video camera, so the lawyer kept his voice low as he answered the question. &quot;I called that number you gave me. A woman answered.&quot;<br />
<i>Tachibana no Akane, since I gave you her private number,</i> recalled Crawford, although he would never admit to how he acquired it.<br />
&quot;I gave her the message you gave me, and then she gave me a message for you in return.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot;<br />
&quot;She requested me to repeat it to you verbatim*. To wit... Steps are being taken to protect <i>everyone</i>, despite your interference and threats otherwise. We will do what we can, although your current troubles with the Federal authorities are all of your own creation.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said a shocked Jack Crawford. &quot;I thought for sure...&quot; <i>Then if Benton Knight, Tachibana, or none of the Elders set me up for this fall... WHO?</i><br />
&quot;There&#39;s more,&quot; said Albertson, before continuing. &quot;Your day of reckoning with us is only postponed, not canceled. Then, when she was sure I had the message correctly, the lady told me to have a nice day, and never call that number ever again before she hung up.&quot;<br />
<i>Damn! I&#39;ll still have to deal with the Elders at some point, but they&#39;re chumps compared to whoever is going to die for making me their patsy!</i> swore Jack Crawford.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Far and Kai were driving back to Moon Lake from their secret Seattle apartment where they had been keeping a discreet eye on the Crawfords.<br />
The apartment was leased through a couple of different dummy corporations, so it would be months before the decision whether or not to keep the place had to be made.<br />
As Far drove, Kai bristled once again at the fact that they were both in their human forms, and not displaying the proud markings of their white furred weretiger forms, like they had sworn to do years ago.<br />
Yet Kai couldn&#39;t deny that the warm sun felt as good on bare flesh as it did fur.<br />
<i>But when did grandfather&#39;s hair become so white?</i> he wondered, turning to take another glance at him. <i>The last time I recall seeing it, it was what some would call a &quot;salt and pepper&quot; combination. Now... I guess time passes before our eyes, even for weres.</i><br />
<br />
BACK IN MOON LAKE...<br />
The bell signalling the class change between second and third periods rang within Moon Lake High.<br />
Eric Anderson wasn&#39;t too crazy about facing Algebra teacher Jeff Wilson again, considering his previous experience with the man, but knew that the werepig was soon to get his, if he hadn&#39;t already...<br />
<br />
Wilson stood outside his classroom door in the hallway, like any other teacher, watching the students go about their business. Yet there was one student in particular he was keeping an eye out for.<br />
<i>If Eric Anderson thought I was tough on him yesterday, just wait till he sees TODAY&#39;S lesson!</i><br />
At first, Wilson didn&#39;t think twice about seeing Principal Ian Andrews in the hallway with a Security Guard. He did grow a little curious as they started coming down the corridor, but then grew more concerned as they stopped in front of him.<br />
&quot;Mister Wilson,&quot; began Principal Andrews, as cordially as he could, considering what he now knew about the man and what he was about to do.<br />
&quot;Principal Andrews,&quot; said Wilson in return, although there was no real friendliness in his voice.<br />
&quot;We need to talk,&quot; said Andrews.<br />
That raised Wilson&#39;s suspicions even higher. &quot;Oh? About what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Your accreditations, or the lack thereof,&quot; answered Andrews, eyeing the teacher carefully.<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot; asked Wilson in return, as students began filing into his classroom.<br />
&quot;How you never finished college after World War 2, yet have been teaching since then, claiming to be an educator with a diploma,&quot; said Andrews coldly.<br />
&quot;HOW?&quot; Wilson said. Whether it was to ask <i>How did you find out?</i> or <i>How could you know about that?</i> was a moot point at the moment.<br />
Then Wilson saw his answer.<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson saw Principal Andrews and a Security Guard standing next to Jeff Wilson, but decided to play it cool.<br />
After all, how could a mere student know about a teacher&#39;s secret past?<br />
Yet there was no denying the anger on Jeff Wilson&#39;s face as Eric drew near.<br />
<b>&quot;YOU!&quot;</b> screamed Wilson. &quot;70 years of teaching ruined by a snot nosed punk!&quot;<br />
Then, before anyone realized what was about to happen or could stop it, Jeff Wilson did the unthinkable.<br />
Angered by what could be the end of his teaching career, because how could a man who looked like he was approaching his mid 20s—but was actually almost a 100 years old—explain needing to finish earning a college degree originally interrupted by World War 2, Jeff Wilson hauled off and punched Eric Anderson right in the nose just as hard and as fast as he could.<br />
Although werepigs are not as high up the strength charts compared to the more powerful weres, the sound of broken bone and cartilage could be heard by those closest to the incident, even without their more superior were hearing ears.<br />
<br />
This set off a MAJOR chain reaction of events!<br />
Caught by surprise, Eric started growling even as blood was spurting out of both nostrils. &quot;UB BROKE BY DOSE!&quot; he shouted, even as he dropped his books and started assuming his werepanther form. Normally, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem, thanks to his girlfriend Frieda Knight buying both her lovers new wardrobes from <i>Awareness</i>, the clothing store that specially catered to weres. Unfortunately, the trio spent last night at her place because of the manhunt for the shooter of Fredrick &quot;The Shark&quot; Parker, so Eric was currently wearing clothing borrowed from Frieda&#39;s father. While decently dressed for school that day, his outfit was now nothing more than scraps and rags at his feet.<br />
With most present having never seen his fursona before, they watched in amazement as Eric changed into an 8 foot tall white furred werepanther with a touch of brown on top of his head.<br />
An 8 foot tall, VERY ANGRY werepanther that was holding the end of his bloody muzzle with both paws while menacingly growling at Jeff Wilson. <br />
<br />
The Security Guard started to move in-between Wilson and Anderson to keep things from getting even worse. <i>For a werepig, he&#39;s acting more like a wild boar right now,</i> thought the guard, who happened to be a weretiger himself.<br />
<br />
Principal Andrews stood in the doorway to attempt keeping the students inside from getting out to see what was happening and usher the students outside on to wherever they were supposed to be, if not inside this specific classroom.<br />
<br />
Inside the classroom Alex Ramsey and Ben Twist, recognizing Eric&#39;s growl, tried to make their way to the front of the crowd now forming at the door trying to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
And in their own respective classrooms, Spencer Lawson and Frieda Knight felt their mutual boyfriend&#39;s pain and shifting into his fursona.<br />
&quot;Eric needs me!&quot; they each proclaimed, rushing out of their classes to be beside the man they loved, much to the dismay of their teachers as the bell rang to start third period.<br />
Teachers who didn&#39;t notice that their now absent students eyes were glowing a brighter, more angry shade of green to match their assault boyfriend&#39;s.<br />
