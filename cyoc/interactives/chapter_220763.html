<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Akari managed to stem the nose bleeding. She decided that this minor setback would not deter her from painting. Putting away all of her negative thoughts, Akari grabbed a new easel, picked up a paint brush and let herself get lost.<br />
<br />
Today, Akari imagined an empty, blue sky. She loved looking out into the horizon, imagining it just stretching on forever. Her hands became stained with blue and white as she continued her work. She added in some orange to make it look more natural.<br />
<br />
Akari looked over her painting. It was pretty, but somehow, it was missing something<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she got a call from Preitha. &quot;Hey &#39;Kari, what time do you get out of work tonight?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m off now actually. Do you want to meet up somewhere?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve got a place in mind.&quot;<br />
---<br />
Akari grabbed a few items from her fridge and walked about 30 minutes from her apartment before she stumbled on a small, public beach. She wasn&#39;t sure what she was looking for until she saw an Indian girl calling out for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Preitha!&quot; Akari exclaimed as she ran over. When she got to Preitha, she was a little perplexed by her appearing to have brought nothing but a blanket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m confused, I thought you wanted to have a snack on the beach.&quot;<br />
&quot;I did&quot; Preitha said as she embraced Akari in a deep kiss.<br />
&quot;That tasted pretty good.&quot; Akari said. She shocked Preitha by pushing her flat on her back. &quot;I&#39;m still a little bit hungry though.&quot; as Akari and Preitha started making out very loudly, to the annoyance of the five other people on the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a room!&quot; one man shouted.<br />
------------<br />
Mr. Chesterton huffed. &quot;I will not let you interfere with my employee.&quot;<br />
&quot;Things have been already set in motion,&quot; Ms. Kagawa said. With a snap of her finger, she disappeared.<br />
<br />
A moment later, Ms. Kagawa appeared on a rooftop in Myrtle Beach. As she looked out on the city, she became aware of a foul presence near her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t think your little parlor magic would work, did you?&quot; Mr. Chesterton asked.<br />
<br />
Ms. Kagawa shrugged. It didn&#39;t matter to her. Come 8:00 on the dot, Preitha would be out of the picture, Akari would be thrown into a deep, never-ending spiral, and she would finally actualize the role she was meant to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re free to watch, Mr. Chesterton, or whatever silly name you parade around town in&quot; she said. Mr. Chesterton said nothing, simply moving the fingers on his left hand in odd circular motions.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Akari and Preitha were walking back to Akari&#39;s apartment. The two had not been to each other&#39;s apartments yet, and Akari elected to go first.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Preeeeti?&quot; Akari asked playfully, which got her a light jab in the arm. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine, Akareeeee.&quot; Preita laughed. &quot;I just don&#39;t eat sugar that often and that funnel cake just sank to the bottom of my stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they made a turn, three men in black hoodies approached them. It was 8:00.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t move.&quot; the first one said as he pulled out a knife.<br />
Akari immediately went for her wallet. &quot;Here, take it, take everything. Please just don&#39;t hurt us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up.&quot; the second man said. &quot;Actually, since you asked nicely. We&#39;ll leave YOU alone.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your friend ain&#39;t so lucky&quot; the third man said as he and the second man grabbed Preitha. &quot;NO, NO, NO&quot; she screamed.<br />
<br />
----<br />
Watching Akari and Preitha struggle with their attackers from a rooftop across the street, Ms. Kagawa was nonplussed. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a shame it has to end this way. My daughter does genuinely look happy.&quot; Ms. Kagawa said as she took a drag of a cigarette.<br />
&quot;Humans can be so savage.&quot; Mr. Chesterton thoughtlessly added. Whatever game Ms. Kagawa was playing, it was irrelevant. He hadn&#39;t lasted this long by being inflexible.<br />
<br />
Akari, being held back by the first man, could only watch as Preitha was about to be stabbed. Closing her eyes, Akari was surprised to feel a drop on her shoulder. She was even more surprised to hear the man behind her scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh, what the fuck&quot; he yelled as he was bleeding from his eyes. The two other men became distracted long enough for Preitha to get loose. Akari, feeling a primal anger, balled her fist and unleashed a vicious right hook which knocked the first man out cold. The second man went after Akari with a knife. She managed to avoid his attack and punched him hard in the stomach. Disoriented, the man could only watch as Akari grabbed his left arm and bent it behind his back. &quot;You fucking pig!&quot; Akari screamed as she dislocated his arm and threw him up against a wall.<br />
<br />
Preitha, in pure disbelief, could only mutter &quot;Akari...how?&quot;. <br />
&quot;I, I- PREITHA, BEHIND YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
Preitha turned around and saw the third man coming right at her with a knife. Preitha&#39;s eyes rolled in the back of her head and the man stopped in his tracks. Suddenly, the man&#39;s entire body seized in pain and he collapsed to the ground. Blood started dripping out of his eyes, mouth, nose, and fingernails. Preitha, with a face of pure hate, continued until she heard Akari scream STOP!. Suddenly, she regained her senses and the third man passed out.<br />
<br />
Akari and Preitha, both with tears streaming down their faces, stared at each other before coming together for a hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Preitha,&quot; Akari wailed. &quot;I didn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s my fault-&quot; Preitha replied. Suddenly, they looked at each other again. Feeling something overcome them, they engaged in a kiss that seemed to last for an hour. &quot;I love you Akari&quot; Preitha said. &quot;I love you Preitha&quot; Akari replied. Preitha smiled. &quot;If you want, I could show you exactly how much&quot; Preitha said, seductively. Akari grabbed Preitha&#39;s hand and they ran to her apartment.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
Ms. Kagawa was flabbergasted. &quot;What the hell just happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;It sure seems like your daughter is more capable than you thought.&quot; Mr. Chesterton said with glee.<br />
&quot;That friend of hers...she&#39;s something different entirely. I will have to come up with a different method to dispose of her&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
As Ms. Kagawa was walking away, she suddenly felt frozen in place. A giant symbol lit up under her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this&quot; she barked.<br />
&quot;The Sarfyrian Knot.&quot; Chesterton said. &quot;I can&#39;t destroy you or even hurt you, but I can keep you out of my affairs for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In flamma, in catenis implicitus, in cogitatione implicat!&quot; he said in a deep and foreboding voice as his eyes turned black. Energy started raising from the symbol.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think this will keep me away for long?&quot; Ms. Kagawa said. &quot;You greatly overestimate your own power.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have nothing to fear from the likes of you.&quot; Mr. Chesterton said. &quot;How many worthless acolytes has your god from above sent that amounted to less than a grain of sand?&quot;<br />
Ms. Kagawa laughed an inhumanly cold laugh as the energy closed around her. &quot;You think that&#39;s my god? Oh my goodness. You really have no idea. My god existed for eons before you even conceived of a thought. And when you finally meet it...you&#39;ll wish I had finished you at the graveyard.&quot; In a manner of seconds, the energy bubble disappeared and with it Ms. Kagawa as well.<br />
<br />
Mr. Chesterton felt a twinge of relief. It was momentary as he came to grips that he had two new problems to deal with: Akari and Preitha<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Akari and Preitha made it to the apartment. The two barely closed the door before they started locking lips. Preitha grabbed Akari&#39;s shirt and pulled it over her head. Akari followed suit and  practically ripped Preitha&#39;s shirt off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get to my bedroom&quot; Akari said as she pulled Preitha towards it. Once they got in, Preitha took off her skirt and Akari pulled off her jeans. They stopped for a second and stared at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your body is amazing.&quot; Akari said in wonder<br />
Preitha blushed. &quot;&#39;Kari, I have been wondering what&#39;s under those baggy shirts and jeans and my goodness, you are hiding something special. So...what now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akari smiled. &quot;I have some ideas.&quot; she replied she walked up to Preitha and started kissing her shoulder. Preitha could feel Akari unloosening her bra and decided to help Akari out with hers. Preitha bit Akari aggressively on the neck and pushed her onto the bed. Pulling her panties down, Preitha licked her lips. &quot;Do you want this Akari?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akari pulled her own panties off and threw them off the bed. &quot;You bet I do.&quot; With glee, Preitha jumped into bed. The two started gyrating on each other, with Akari taking a long lick of Preitha&#39;s leg. &quot;God you taste so good.&quot; Akari said. Preitha stuck one hand in Akari&#39;s vagina and started rubbing aggressively. With the other hand, she grabbed Akari&#39;s right breast. &quot;God, I love your perky tits.&quot; she said. Starting to gather a sweat, Preitha started riding Akari&#39;s left leg aggressively. Akari let out a soft moan as all this was going on. She had been with two men prior, but this was something else. After a couple of minutes, Akari rose up and pushed Preitha flat on the bed. Giving her a long kiss on the mouth, she started nibbling on Preitha&#39;s left breast and fingering Preitha&#39;s clit. Preitha could feel herself start to get more and more aroused. She had been with one girl in her life, but that was nothing compared to this.&quot;Oh god, oh fuck&quot; Preitha started to exclaim. She slapped Akari and pulled her down. Lining Akari&#39;s right leg against her stomach, she started thrusting aggressively. They started grunting and chanting each other&#39;s names. The two, lathered in sweat, kept grinding against each other. Akari slapped Preitha&#39;s ass a couple of times and then grabbed her skin as tightly as she could. Preitha grabbed the side of Akari&#39;s stomach to keep her posture and bit her neck again. &quot;Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHhhhhhhhhh&quot; as the two hit climax at just about the same time. <br />
<br />
------<br />
Akari and Preitha laid flat on the bed, exhausted and covered in sweat and cum. They turned to each other and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have a bond Akari&quot; Preitha said in admiration.<br />
&quot;I used to think I was alone, just a freak with nothing to offer anyone.&quot; Akari said. &quot;I wasn&#39;t; I just hadn&#39;t met the person who made me whole.&quot;<br />
&quot;We can be whoever we want Akari.&quot; Preitha said. &quot;No one can tell us what we should with our lives or the paths we choose. We can do something special.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re perfect Preitha,&quot; Akari said affectionately. &quot;Never let anyone tell you otherwise.<br />
<br />
The two exchanged one more deep kiss and then passed out on the bed.</p>
