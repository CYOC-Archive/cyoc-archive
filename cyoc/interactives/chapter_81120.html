<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Half way to the bathroom Jessica got an idea. Nikki was probably at work right now, bored out of her mind, so why not make her day a little more interesting, just as a joke?<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me for a sec,&quot; Jessica said quickly, hurrying over to the computer. She had just gotten a great idea and wanted to see if it was possible before she forgot it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Nikki was working a weird not quite full day because Samantha, one of the other girls who worked with her had called in sick. She knew Samantha wasn't really sick, that she called in at least twice a month when the weather was nice, but Nikki wasn't the sort to complain, especially when it had her working the same hours as Max. Ever since she had started working at the used book store two years ago she had a crush on Max, but hadn't been able to get the courage up to ask him out. She didn't even know if he was even interested in her, which was part of the reason she was afraid to say anything about dating to him. The last thing she wanted was to bring up the topic only to find that he had no interest in her. Jessica might have laughed at her for creating such a problem for herself, but Nikki preferred hope of a possibility than finding out with certainty that it would never happen.<br />
<br />
Max was working at cash register, ringing up what looked like an entire set of encyclopedias that a little old woman had purchased. Nikki was going back and forth between the shelves and the back room, trying to figure out how to fill in the newly empty space where all the books the woman had bought had been. There were plenty of books in the back room, but she couldn't just put in a random jumble of books in the reference section, not if she wanted to keep her job.<br />
<br />
She had just about solved the problem, having found a set of books on World War Two history and a really old but nice looking illustrated children's dictionary when her cellphone buzzed, letting her know that she had a text message.<br />
<br />
Curious at who would be texting her at work she took out her phone and frowned. It was from Jessica and all it said was, 'ha ha'.<br />
<br />
Nikki shook her head. It was typical, Jessica was always up to some sort of joke or another and it looked like she had started something. She knew that she was going to have to stay on her toes when she got home to keep from walking right into it.<br />
<br />
Stopping for a moment to adjust her bra strap, Nikki put her phone away and went back to stocking the shelves. Double checking the amount of space on the shelf one last time, she went to the back room to pull out the box of books she had found to put out. Max was still helping the same customer and it looked like he was going to have to help carry her purchase out so he wouldn't be able to help, not that it bothered her. Things were slow enough right now that every little bit of work helped to make the time pass faster.<br />
<br />
As she walked out of the back room she adjusted how she was carrying the box. She must have picked it up at a really awkward angle or something because it was really pressing hard against her breasts. Something was odd, no matter how she shifted the weight of the box it was still awkward.<br />
<br />
Once she got to the shelves she put the box down and shrugged her shoulders, feeling the weight of her breasts as they bounced up and down. The pressure still remained and her breasts felt, well, not exactly tender, but maybe more sensitive.<br />
<br />
She looked up and caught Max looking at her. When their eyes met he smiled at her. She smiled back, a thrill of excitement running through her.<br />
<br />
Maybe today was the day that he would ask her out, sparing her from having to make a stand and ask him.<br />
<br />
Nikki began to take the books out of the box, her arm brushing across her chest as she reached to put the dictionary on the shelf. The slight contact sent another shiver through her. Yes, there was no doubt about it, her breasts seemed more sensitive. She could actually feel how tight her shirt felt against them and the way her nipples were pressing against the silky, smooth fabric of her bra. When she looked down it cam as no surprise to see that her nipples were hard, poking up and visible through her shirt. The thing was, she could never remember them being as obvious as they were now. Not quite certain of what she was seeing meant, she gently brushed a hand across her chest, feeling the hardness of her nipples and gasping as a rush of warmth flowed through her pussy.<br />
<br />
Blushing, she tried to focus on putting the rest of the books of the shelves and ignore how impossibly horny she was getting, but the way her breasts bounced and jiggled with every move she made was making it harder and harder to focus on the task at hand. The fact that her arms kept brushing against them and how tight her shirt felt didn't help at all. Every slight touch and little bounce sent another jolt of pleasure through her, going from her breasts to her pussy, making it feel so warm.<br />
<br />
Focused as she was on ignoring her growing arousal, she failed to notice that Max had finished helping the customer and had come back to the shelves until he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how's it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki's eyes went wide at the sound of his voice and she stood up straight to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm good,&quot; she stammered, the way he was looking at her making her blush. Her nipples were still rock hard, pressing almost painfully against her shirt and she was sure that he had noticed. Embarrassed, she tried to fold her arms across her chest, tried being the key word. No matter how she positioned them, her breasts seemed to be in the way and when she looked down, no longer able to meet Max's eyes, she could see why. Her breasts had grown.<br />
<br />
They had gone from being a fairly average c-cup to what could only be a d-cup. Even her nipples were bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Max said quickly, &quot;Because you went really pale all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did?&quot; she said weakly, worried about him noticing her sudden growth spurt, &quot;I mean I... I guess I need to sit down for a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
All at once it had clicked into place and she understood what was going on, what Jessica's joke was.<br />
<br />
Not waiting for a response she hurried to the back room, feeling her breasts heave and bounce with every step she took. Closing the door behind her she pulled out her cell phone and called Jessica. <br />
<br />
Her friend picked up after the second ring, giggling uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not funny,&quot; Nikki fumed, &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some stuff,&quot; Jessica said between fits of laughter, &quot;Don't worry I set it so you and me are the only ones who know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me back now,&quot; Nikki hissed, not seeing any humor in the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't, not yet,&quot; she kept laughing, &quot;Not until the changes are done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Nikki squeaked, &quot;There's more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Just have fun with them. Trust me, you'll like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
After that there was more laughter.<br />
<br />
Furious and embarrassed Nikki turned off the phone and looked down at herself. Her breasts were still getting bigger, or at least she thought they were. It was kind of hard to tell, especially when her eyes were drawn to her nipples. They were just so embarrassingly big, probably half an inch long. Unable to help herself, she ran her fingers over them, feeling how hard they were and how sensitive they were. Despite her anger and fear she felt her pussy starting to heat up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said softly to herself, putting her hands down to her sides, &quot;I can handle this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking several deep breaths to calm down she marched over to the door and went back into the store.<br />
<br />
Max was waiting at the door for her, &quot;Feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
She forced herself to smile, &quot;Yeah. I don't know what came over me for a second there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; he nodded, his eyes flickering down to her chest for a moment before he smiled, &quot;I'm glad you're okay. You had me worried for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Self consciously, she brought her arms to try and cover her chest, &quot;I'm okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; he gave an awkward little laugh before going back over to the cash register.<br />
<br />
Nikki went back to finish putting the books on the shelf, unable to help letting out the occasional gasp as she moved in a way that caused her breasts to bounce a bit too hard. It felt so good that her pussy was practically aching for attention. She could actually feel herself starting to get wet.<br />
<br />
Finally she finished with the shelves. Looking up she again saw that Max had been watching her as she worked and again she blushed, this time because thoughts of him sucking on her big, achingly hard tits sprung unbidden to her mind. She again forced herself to smile at him and the way he smiled back at her again sent a thrill running through her, this time accompanied by a little spurt of moisture from her pussy.<br />
<br />
Still smiling she went to the bathroom and locked the door behind her. As soon as she turned on the light her smile fell and she let out a heavy sigh.<br />
<br />
Afraid of what she would see, she turned to look at herself in the mirror. Her breasts had ballooned out to ridiculous proportions so that it looked like she had a pair of basketballs under her shirt, their inch long nipples sticking straight out, tenting her shirt. At least her shirt had changed with her growing breasts so that it kept her covered, even if it was so tight that it did practically nothing to conceal what was beneath. The strange thing was, as horrifying as the change was to her, she still felt incredibly sexy. The way her huge breasts moved when she walked actually turned her on. Her pussy felt so hot and wet just from looking at her reflection that she realized that something had to be different there too.<br />
<br />
Pulling down her pants and then her sodden panties she looked at her clean shaven pussy. Its soft lips were flush pink and swollen with arousal, glistening with moisture and ready to be parted by a big, hard cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she sighed softly at the thought, her feminine juices flowing in anticipation of a good, rough fucking. She had never had such thoughts before, but now it was nearly impossible to push them out of her mind. Her pussy was so tight and wet that it needed filling. She could even see the little button of her clit above her soft pussy lips, sticking out farther than it ever had before, begging to be sucked. More than anything, she needed to be fucked, to have Max push her against the wall, shove his cock into her and pound into her pussy again and again, pulling and sucking on her tits until she came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she spoke to herself, trying to force those thoughts from her mind, &quot;I've got to keep calm. I need to relax and not think about how much I need my pussy filled with a big, hard cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without even meaning to she had brought a hand up to massage her breasts, while her other hand drifted down to her pussy to stroke her clit, first running a finger over her wet slit to moisten it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she brought her hands to her sides and clenched her fists, &quot;Deep breaths. No sexy thoughts, none at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki struggled to ignore how hot her pussy was, to not think about how sensitive her big, bouncy breasts were. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to put my panties back on,&quot; she tried to talk herself through what she needed to do, &quot;And go back to work. That's all there is to it, just slide my panties up my legs, let them press up against my pussy and feel how smooth they are against my clit. It'll feel so good, the way they'll rub me as I walk, not as good as having my pussy stuffed full of cock, but it'll be good.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stopped reaching for her panties to finger herself, exploring the inner spaces of her pussy and imagining what it would feel like to shove them in deeper, fingering herself until she came. The problem was, that wasn't what she wanted, far from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max?&quot; she called out weakly, realizing that her thoughts all came back to one thing, getting fucked, &quot;Could you come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to believe what she was doing she unlocked the door and pulled off her shirt and bra, allowing her breasts to hang free. They hardly drooped at all, staying round and firm, their big, dark nipples jutting out in the cool air of the room.<br />
<br />
Max opened the door and his eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
All Nikki could think of was his cock and how good it would feel in her pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; she couldn't believe what she was about to say, but it was what she wanted more than anything, &quot;I need you to fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile he gave her let her know that this was what he had been wanting for a very long time. He locked the door behind him, unzipped his fly and let his cock spring free. It was nothing exceptional, a respectable six inches and the instant Nikki set eyes on it she felt a spurt of pussy juice trickle down her legs.<br />
<br />
She practically threw herself at him in her hurry to feel him slip inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, take it easy,&quot; he laughed, pressing his hands against her breasts.<br />
<br />
She moaned, her knees going weak as he cupped her massive breasts in his hands, guiding her back to the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please,&quot; she panted, &quot;Please fuck me hard. I want to feel that big, throbbing cock of yours in my pussy. I need to be fucked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; he brought his cock to her pussy, rubbing the head against her plush slit, &quot;Wow, you're wet!&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, &quot;I've been waiting so long for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way he was teasing, letting her feel his cock against her, but not giving her its full length was maddening. All she wanted was for him to stick it in her, but she struggled to keep herself from lunging forward to impale herself on him. Minutes ago she had been struggling to keep herself from doing this and she tried to call back so of that restraint, to at least keep her going a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; he gave one of her nipples a gentle tug, causing her to squirm and moan, &quot;You ready for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; she gasped, &quot;Please, just shove it in me. I can't take much more of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikki couldn't believe how horny she was, her tits and clit throbbed with sensation as Max continued to slide his cock head up and down along her hot, wet slit, parting her pussy lips without actually plunging in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here it goes,&quot; with a grunt he thrust into her.<br />
<br />
The sensation was electric, her soft folds parting and allowing him entrance, the muscles of her pussy clenching down around his cock with another spurt of pussy juice. Nikki bucked her hips against him, her inner muscles squeezing down on his cock as she gasped for breath. It felt so good, so right, like the most natural thing in the world was for her to have Max's cock buried balls deep in her.<br />
<br />
He began to slide back out and she whimpered, her pussy spasming, not wanting to release his wonderful, hard cock.<br />
<br />
It was almost out, just the head in, and he held it there for a moment, squeezing her breasts as she bucked against him, wanting to have the full length of his cock back in her.<br />
<br />
Just when she thought she wouldn't be able to take it any longer he thrust back in. Again her pussy clamped down on his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; he laughed, &quot;You're good at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Nikki gasped as Max started to thrust rhythmically, &quot;This is my first time. If I'd know it would feel this good I'd have asked you to fuck me a long time ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
With each thrust her pussy spasmed, driving her to greater and greater heights of pleasure. Her breasts were crushed between them as she pressed herself harder and harder against him. Pussy juice flowed down her thighs like a river, droplets flying through the air and hitting the floor as Max thrust and she writhed in pleasure.<br />
<br />
He began to pick up the pace, his thrusts becoming faster and harder, causing Nikki's enormous breasts to bounce and heave wildly until he tensed, holding her in a crushing embrace as his cock twitched in her, a powerful blast of hot cum jetting deep into her pussy.<br />
<br />
Nikki came herself, the feeling of Max's hot seed filling her pussy driving her to an orgasm so powerful that it left her unable to stand. When Max released her, his cock sliding from her thoroughly pleasured pussy with a wet 'pop' she fell to the floor in a puddle of her own juices.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; she gasped when she was at last able to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Max said with a content sigh before grabbing a handful of paper towels to blot her juices off his cock.</p>
