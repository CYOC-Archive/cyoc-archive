<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Both those options suck!&quot; you shouted. &quot;I am very happy being a guy, thankyouverymuch! and I don&#39;t want to be a kid again. I just hit puberty, if anything I&#39;d want to... Never mind.&quot; <br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t close with them, confiding your desires could only be used against you, and they just made your dick disappear which hasn&#39;t fully registered quite yet. The twins shared a glance, and an evil smile crossed their face. &quot;Dearest sister, do you scheme what I scheme?&quot; Tyler asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dearest brother, I believe we may have found, exactly what we&#39;ve been searching for.&quot; Terra responded. In unison they turned to look at you with excited grins barely holding back their glee. &quot;Speak the words Cousin! Declare them aloud!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s my penis?&quot; You asked suddenly realizing it wasn&#39;t a trick but you now have only a slit above your ball sack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that! You truly desire to be...&quot; Tyler began and made a pulling gesture with his hands, as if pulling on a rope, and the words were vomited out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;A man!&quot; you blurted out, &quot;Where&#39;s my penis?&quot; you said louder with a rising note of terror.<br />
<br />
The twins cackled, &quot;Fear not cousin, your desire aligns with ours, and that comes with rewards. You&#39;ll get your penis back and your desire will be fulfilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terra grabbed the damp towel, threw it over your crotch and rubbed vigorously. You instinctively curled into a ball pulling your other hand and arm away from Tyler, ending up in something close to the fetal position, apprehensively pulling the towel away and examining your restored crotch.<br />
<br />
A sudden jab in your exposed buttocks made you yelp and flail around... Terra injected you with something! &quot;Now brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair clasped hands and began chanting. You tried to focus but they were saying different things and immediately you felt strange, tired, and although you didn&#39;t want to, you passed out before being able to react.<br />
<br />
You awoke groggily to knocking. &quot;One minute&quot; you called still in a dreamy stupor. Hurriedly, you dressed yourself. Your cousin&#39;s weren&#39;t in the room any longer and despite being awake, you still felt that dreamlike sensation pressing down on your thoughts and memories as you opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; you opened the guest bedroom door to find Aunt Ulrica standing there eagerly. &quot;Did you have a decent nap? Long drives can be exhausting. Listen, I was thinking you and the twins could spend the day together, see the town. I have some things I need to get done and I hate imposing, but would you mind babysitting for the day? I can give you guys some cash to go out and have some fun, I just don&#39;t want to drag them along when they will be bored out of their minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t they be babysitting me?&quot; you asked, they were after all, 2 months older than you.<br />
<br />
Aunt Ulrica let out a hearty chuckle. &quot;You&#39;re still asleep I see. No, the 13 year old twins wouldn&#39;t be babysitting the 17 year old.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then you noticed you were looking down at your Aunt and your head was within just a few inches of the door frame. &quot;Just kidding with ya, yeah, I&#39;d love to spend time with my cousins.&quot; you replied, meaning it for the first time since you met them... you wanted answers!<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; She handed you a $100 bill and left, apparently eager to leave.<br />
<br />
You shut the door and looked around the room noticing the only difference was that you had a larger suitcase. going through it you found different/larger sized clothes and shaving supplies, which you didn&#39;t own previously because you didn&#39;t need it at 13... You heard the front door close and a moment later a car door shut, and the engine turned over...<br />
<br />
Apprehensively, you went to the guest bathroom finding yourself to be in the body of a young man. You wouldn&#39;t believe it if you didn&#39;t recognize the merger of your familial traits and the fact that you could see and touch the facial and sparse body hair growing on your enlarged form...<br />
<br />
You knew this was the twins&#39; doing, somehow... but they had already made it clear that you being useful to them is the only reason you aren&#39;t a 4 year old or a girl. It&#39;s time to confront them and most likely report for duty...<br />
<br />
You walk into the living room to find them sitting on the couch. &quot;Hello there cousin, you&#39;re hideous now, but we do hope you like it, it is what you wanted after all.&quot; Tyler called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hideous!?!?&quot; you balked in shock. You looked normal, maybe even a little handsome by your estimates. Where does he get off calling you hideous?<br />
<br />
Tyler looked at you confused. &quot;You&#39;ve lost nearly all of your childish innocence. Your body has maybe a final growth spurt or two to push out and then it will simply stagnate. You will slowly deteriorate over decades until you die. The only growth left for your body now is to grow fat and hairy... it&#39;s sad and... what you wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were floored by your cousin&#39;s perception of growing up... he wasn&#39;t exactly wrong but it was a doozey of a perspective to say the least. &quot;So when you threatened to make me a four year old boy or turn me into a girl, that was to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no threat! We wanted to instill you with youth or at least give you the ability to cultivate life.&quot; Terra chimed in. &quot;It is beyond our understanding that you seemed displeased by our offered gifts to help our dear cousin. We were sure you would love both of those options but you are quite the strange one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the strange one!?!?!?!&quot; Again floored by their &#39;take&#39; on reality... but you&#39;ve got to focus, &quot;Aunt Ulrica, said I&#39;m 17 now. Is she in on this or does everyone like my parents and friends think I&#39;m 17 too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only we,&quot; Tyler started, &quot;And you.&quot; Terra finished. &quot;Know how things used to be, for now.&quot; They said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean for now?&quot; You asked, fearing tomorrow would become a summer long grounding for tricking your Aunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;The more you use your 17 year-old knowledge the further away your life as a 13 year old gets, until you forget all about our gift and go on with your life.&quot; Terra said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean knowledge? I don&#39;t know anything.&quot; You said confused. <br />
<br />
Tyler smirked pulling back the window shade, &quot;You&#39;d better, because you&#39;re our ride for the summer.&quot; Out the window, was the family car, but deep down you knew it was yours now. No longer were you dropped off by your parents but you used your phone&#39;s GPS to make the 3 hour drive starting at 6 this morning. <br />
<br />
No longer were forced to stay with your Aunt over the summer due to your parents having erratic schedules. Instead this was your chance to be independent, maybe get a summer job and &#39;support yourself&#39; in the sense of food, and expenses. You&#39;re even paying $100/month in rent to your Aunt, which she was against but you insisted... and explains at least some of the money she handed you &#39;for babysitting&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah.&quot; you muttered.<br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other and smiled. It&#39;s going to be an interesting summer, and not necessarily in the bad way like you initially thought.</p>
