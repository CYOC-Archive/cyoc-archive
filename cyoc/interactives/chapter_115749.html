<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So there goes today&#39;s episode,&quot; Sophie gave a small smile as Animalia&#39;s ambassadors began turning off their equipment, &quot;you&#39;re sure you don&#39;t want to see what the first comments are?&quot;<br />
<br />
In this she looked to Abby, Sarah, and Malice. The three shook their heads no before moving toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Valentines Day,&quot; Abby answered, &quot;and well... I have something special planned for me and Samson... and since mom and dad went out to Lover&#39;s Woods for the night, Samson and I have the house to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Simon and Travis are coming to pick us up for a nice dinner,&quot; Malice spoke, &quot;hopefully with fun for all after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie glanced over to Jessica and the two of them shrugged. Abby and Sarah both nodded at the end of Malice&#39;s comment. To Sophie and Jessica, it was something both knew reflected Abby&#39;s, Sarah&#39;s, and Malice&#39;s status as double dosers and mated Animalians. They either had plans to have sex or were looking for a situation that would lead to sex, which fitted their position. Neither Sophie nor Jessica had any real complaints. They had mates who they loved and who apparently loved them as well. Sophie and Jessica both liked that and to a degree even hoped for that. Jessica had Roger as a boyfriend and she had had plenty of fun with him, but both of them had agreed to wait until they both grew up the old fashioned way. It wasn&#39;t as though they would end up being built the way they were built now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, have fun,&quot; Abby waved and went out with Sarah and Malice soon heading out as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun... with what?&quot; Sophie sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Roger and I were going to the high school dance,&quot; Jessica commented, &quot;You could come along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a third wheel?&quot; Sophie raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or to at least have company,&quot; Jessica commented.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In the end, Sophie ended up going to the school&#39;s Valentines Day Dance as there wasn&#39;t that much else that could be done. Roger was there to meet them, he offered Sophie and arm, but she preferred to try and stay as proud as she could. They walked into the gymnasium to find it decorated in pink, red, and white ribbon with various people, all high school students, dancing to various romantic songs. Sophie actually liked some of the music, but she had no one to dance with. In this she began to drift toward a series of folding tables that had been set up with a bowl of punch and with plastic cups set up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be okay, right?&quot; Jessica asked as she and Roger moved toward center of the gym floor, her ears standing on alert.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;You go have a good time. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find some other wall flower to talk to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jessica said slowly and walked out with Roger and Sophie watched as they were soon dancing together and Sophie could see the smiles on their lapine muzzles.<br />
<br />
That only made Sophie sigh. She was generally content to stay human and didn&#39;t see any express reason to become an Animalian. Abby, Sarah, and Jessica didn&#39;t like her any less, and in fact Malice&#39;s uplifting had allowed Sophie to truly make friends with Sarah&#39;s former pet and now sister. They got along with her and that more than proved that humans and Animalians could get along. It was made her a good part of Animalia&#39;s ambassadors because she was human while the rest were Animalians. The one thing that Sophie really found herself a bit jealous over was her friend&#39;s romantic endeavors. Abby, Sarah, and Malice might well be married, given how Animalians treated mateship once that was determined, and while Jessica and Roger hadn&#39;t gotten a second dose, it was pretty obvious that  they would make similar commitments as the others in the future. Sophie really didn&#39;t have anyone that could fill in a similar role.<br />
<br />
She made it over to the refreshments area and picked up a cup of fruit punch before turning to look out to the others dancing. She soon became so caught up in watching that she she didn&#39;t notice the steps approaching her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... Sophie... right?&quot; a voice asked.<br />
<br />
Sophie jumped a little, and very nearly spilled her drink before turning to see a young male teen. He was an average build and wore glasses that didn&#39;t seem perfectly balanced. Sophie thought his name as Roland Luwrie, but wasn&#39;t sure as he was rather shy. She did answer him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Roland, right?&quot; Sophie answered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your latest episode went fairly well,&quot;  Roland nodded, &quot;fun with Valentines... one of those things that makes Animalia and Animalians very interesting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Sophie wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... most were born as mundane animals and much of what we&#39;d define as love would be things that are unfamiliar to them in the way we define,&quot; Roland explained, &quot;yet... they&#39;ve not only picked up on it they&#39;ve seemed to live it. You... know... how close and loving your friends Abby, Sarah, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She prefers Malice,&quot; Sophie began, &quot;but of them, Abby and Sarah were born human and were transformed by accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Roland nodded, &quot;but even their mates... Samson, Travis, and... well Simon was born human... but even with the other two... it&#39;s like the Animalia Virus gave them all the skills and other aspects of humanity to let them understand truly what love is based on how we define it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose they do,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;but today&#39;s episode was designed to be a bit more light hearted and showing some of the &quot;failures&quot; at attempted courtship. Sort of like some of the shows in TruTV.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... it was rather funny,&quot; Roland chuckled and then spoke seriously, &quot;again showing all the things that point to Humans and Animalians being a lot alike.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie sipped her drink for a moment and stood there with Roland for a few moments. He took a cup and soon stood directly beside her. They stood quietly for a few moments and neither said anything for a brief moment. Eventually Roland broke the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like watching you on Animalia Ambassadoria,&quot; Roland said simply, &quot;You look cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie turned to him and saw his red cheeks. Roland looked like he was about fifteen, but yet he was blushing at her. She was built like a stick when compared to Abby, Sarah, and Malice and Roland was blushing at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve watched since it started,&quot; Roland spoke, &quot;and you and your friends have done well... inspired me even. Really thought about being an actual ambassador when I grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... but Animalia Ambassadoria is more of a PR effort,&quot; Sophie pointed out, &quot;Animalia is still part of the US and subject to US law. Our program to help raise awareness and help explain Animalia so that people don&#39;t try to urge Animalia be wiped out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but you&#39;ve all also shared Animalia&#39;s hopes and dreams and aspects,&quot; Roland pointed out, &quot;which in a way is what an ambassador does. I&#39;d like to do stuff like that some day... and learn how to do it from the prettiest member of Animalia Ambassadoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie felt a very strong blush form in her cheeks as this boy complimented her.</p>
