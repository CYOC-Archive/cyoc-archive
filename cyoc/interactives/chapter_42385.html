<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You don’t know what to say at first. You look around to try and find some inspiration among the three other faces in the room, but they were expressionless. The white fluorescent lights made the small office with no windows seem empty of ideas. Figuring that the portals would have to be at random anyway, you look at the watch now on your left arm and pull up the lid, looking at the colored buttons. You shrug and press red, yellow, green, and then green again.<br />
<br />
You look around the room again. Nothing happened. “Am I supposed to do something else?” you ask.<br />
<br />
The scientist you had just talked to reached over to your watch and closed the lid. From there, the points of the watch started to turn in rapid succession, and a glow emanated to show almost a holographic portal above it. A flash of lightning from the small device sent a chill down your spine and shot towards the wall. It caused a huge hole, but what was on the other side was not normal.<br />
<br />
Right beside the portal was the door you used to get in the room. Outside of the room was the hallway; you knew that for sure. The portal showed a dirt, underground tunnel of sorts which led on what seemed like forever; something which made no sense and was not in the continuity of reality. If you had any doubts that this was not real, then this proved you wrong.<br />
<br />
“So I’m supposed to just go in there?” You ask stupidly.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” the scientist responded. “Not to worry; it may seem daunting, but don’t think about it too much. Besides, not always will it be a tunnel. Many times we opened the portal to flat plains, and at one time, it opened a few hundred feet in the air. I’m sure this tunnel leads somewhere.”<br />
<br />
You agree nodding, but you are a bit frightened about going through the tunnel. You know that you are a little claustrophobic.<br />
<br />
You stand up from your chair. “Right,” you say, trying to buy some time. You’re sweating a little bit. You take a deep breath and walk towards the wall. “Okay—I’m okay.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll try to contact you in twenty-four hours,” said another scientist. “Don’t lose the watch.”<br />
<br />
“Got it,” you say, and continue your calm breathing. It’s now or never, you think, and you pull yourself into the tunnel. You can’t stand; you have to crawl. It did not look like the tunnel was going to get any smaller than it was, but you didn’t want to spend any more time in the tunnel than you needed to. You crawled smoothly, and quickened your pace as you crawled deeper. “How far am I?”<br />
<br />
There was no answer. You turn back, but you could barely see the opening you had come in through. You look forward again, a wave of nausea overtaking. You don’t want it to get any stronger, so you push onward. As you crawl deeper, the walls begin to get moister. They quickly turn to mud, and you begin to have a hard time moving forward. You turn back once again and gasp when you see that the mud has blocked the path you had come from. You look onwards again and realize that it leads to a dead-end. You are trapped where you are.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the mud walls cave in on you and you freak out. You begin swinging your arms and feet around madly in the liquid ooze, unable to move or breathe much. You feel the mud pulling on your skin, grinding against you and tearing off your shirt. You begin to see that it’s your clothes that are wearing you down in the mess.<br />
<br />
You manage to find a pocket of air; another hallway to nowhere, and you take a deep breath, now covered in mud. You try to pull yourself out of the rest of the mess, but your jeans are keeping you from going any further in the tunnel. You slide out of them. Not even your underwear could be saved, or your shoes. Your socks are on, but they are so soggy that you believe they’ll drag you down like the rest of the clothes. You are crazy enough to remove them.<br />
<br />
Now you are naked in the muddy tunnel, and frantic beyond your belief. You crawl at a high speed, wanting to get out for good, but it leads to another dead end. To make matters worse, the mud caves in on you again, and you can’t breath. Again, you have the feeling of the mud pulling on your skin roughly. It pulls roughly on your chest and you feel a harsh tug and an ache of pain on your groin. You try to break free by moving your arms around as if to swim out. You’re pretty sure you feel the watch come off your arm, but you don’t care at the moment, and continue to fling your arms around as your heart rate increases. Then you feel your fingertips touch nothing but air, and a cool breeze go through them.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
It is the swamp lands, and is famous around the Village of Danbirth. It is nighttime, and there is an eerie mist upon the muddy utopia. It almost seemed as if there was nothing that could bother this land of mud.<br />
<br />
A medium brown furry, mud covered arm cut through the surface of the swamp swiftly. The claw tips dug onto the dense mud surface, and the other arm burst out of the mess. The figure, approximately 17 of age, managed to pull her head over the land and take in a deep breath, screaming a loud cry, hair the color of her fur matted on her face. After taking several breaths, she wiped the hair away from her vision and looked around.<br />
<br />
The forest of the swamp could hardly be called a forest; every tree was dead with no leaves.<br />
<br />
She continued to pull herself out until her chest was visible. It was then when she realized something she had not been expecting.<br />
<br />
One, she was an anthro. Two, she was a she. Three, she was you.<br />
<br />
You’re scared, and are unsure how to react. From your vision, you can see your muzzle and begin to touch it lightly. Gently, you flick your wet nose; it was sensitive to the touch. You look back down. Your “underbelly” was off-white; you stare at your new furry whitish breasts, still unbelieving. They were a round, good size. You grope them, jiggle them, shake them around, and feel a striking arousal from doing so. Tears begin to form at the corners of your eyes. You knew that this could have been a possibility, but you had hoped that it wouldn’t come to it.<br />
<br />
Yet as much as you want to give up, you can’t. You have to get yourself out of the mud. Clawing at the ground, you clench your sharp fangs as you try to pull yourself out. You successfully do so, and breathe heavily when the task is done. Slowly, you crawl away from the spot and turn around to face the sky, and then look at your mud covered breasts again, trying to blink them away. Not even pushing against them made them disappear; you had hoped they could at least recede into your chest a little so as not to be so noticeable. You had to face it; from the perspective of someone else, there was no way they could tell you were anything but a girl.<br />
<br />
You sit up with a pain on your back and tail. You turn around to find a short-tail with a black tip. At this point, you are aware of what species you are; you’re an ermine. All ermines have black tips at the end of their short tails.<br />
<br />
You look down at where your manhood used to be. The fact that you saw what should belong to a woman scared you. As you reach to touch the area, you get a closer look at your hands. They were padded underneath, and the claws were definitely sharp.<br />
<br />
Sighing, you begin to contemplate what you should do. You manage to reassure yourself that being an anthro ermine woman would only be for a little while, approximately twenty-four hours—<br />
<br />
Then it suddenly dawns on you; the wristwatch! It remained somewhere hidden in the mud!<br />
<br />
You make a frantic dive to the spot where you crawled out of and begin to dig furiously, all the while saying, “no, no, no!” to yourself.</p>
