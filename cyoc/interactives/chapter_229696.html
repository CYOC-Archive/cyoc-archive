<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I purposefully left some options for future writers. You can write that Danny already cleaned up after himself leaving no clues to the disappearance of Chad. You can write that Danny left clues but the plumbers and electricians cleaned all the clues away assuming that it was just teenage mischief and not someone&#39;s disappearance. Or you can write about someone discovering the clues and learning about Chad&#39;s disappearance.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of some of the potential clues: the package the strap came in, the fieldhouse key, the different notes, the conversation with Bruno, the conversation with Rick, Chad&#39;s strange behavior just before he disappeared, any conversations he had with other students or teachers, Chad&#39;s clothes and pack, the strap, the bottles of tie dye, the mirror,  the protective gloves, the ointments, the debris when Chad lost parts of himself, the rope, Danny&#39;s clothes and pack, the p.a. system which was not supposed to have been turned on yet, any and all fingerprints and possible traces of other bodily fluids such as Chad&#39;s pre-cum.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad saw someone coming down the stairs. It was Danny. In a way, Danny was Chad&#39;s biggest rival.<br />
<br />
Athletically, the two never competed in the same sports. Chad always showed a knack for leading a team to victory while Danny tended more toward sports where he competed by himself without any team. While Chad had his hands full with football and waterpolo, Danny kept getting trophies in wrestling, gymnastics, pole vault, and triathlon. Danny was also known as the best dancer around. Danny really knew how to move his body. Even Chad found himself mesmerized by Danny&#39;s dancing.<br />
<br />
In popularity contests, it often came down to Chad or Danny which was strange because Danny was also one of the most private people Chad ever knew. Danny could walk into a room and exude so much charisma and charm that everyone wanted to be with him but Danny rarely spoke and often wandered off to be by himself.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;No, this has nothing to do with you Chad. I just really want to be a jocktaur, the first jocktaur in history and in order to become a jocktaur, I need a jock to become my back half. You should feel proud because that means you get the privilege of becoming my new butt. Now let me get a look at my new backside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad tried to fight but with his arms as flimsy as they were, it was very easy for Danny to push Chad around. Danny turned Chad this way and that to get a good look at Chad&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Not bad, not bad but there are some improvements I can make.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny put protective clothes on his hands and then began massaging some kind of ointment into Chad&#39;s genitals. Chad&#39;s genitals plumped up big. Chad&#39;&#39;s genitals grew proportionally so that it wasn&#39;t just a longer cock. Chad&#39;s cock gained girth and his balls grew larger too.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;You see, part of why I want to be a jocktaur and not a centaur is that I don&#39;t want a horse cock. I want a big cock but I still want a human cock between my new hind legs. My front cock is big enough already but I want my hind cock to be really impressive. I want my hind cock to be more for show, that I use my front cock more for my own attention but that I use my hind cock to attract attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny told the truth. His own cock hung eight inches flaccid. Once Chad&#39;s cock grew to twelve inches long flaccid, Danny shifted his attention to plump Chad&#39;s ass up to a ridiculously large size.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Now I have mixed feelings about body hair. As long as guys don&#39;t let their hair grow wild like a jungle, I can find guys with a nice amount of body hair attractive but I can also find those guys who completely shave their body hair attractive. I know some guys complain that guys who shave look like children but that is ridiculous. The genitals of children are tiny. It is impossible for large, shaved genitals to look like children. Instead, large genitals that are completely clean, pure, sanitary, immaculate, blatant, objective, audacious, accessible, on display and exposed, have a certain attractiveness about them. Therefore, I will keep my front body as hairy as it normally is but I wish my hind body to be completely hairless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny applied another ointment that removed all of Chad&#39;s body hair. This ointment also had the effect of making Chad&#39;s skin whiter and pinker. Chad&#39;s pores opened up and any blemishes he had shrank. Chad had struggled with acne on his legs but the ointment cleared the acne away.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;There, now that&#39;s the hind body I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad had been yelling this whole time but his voice still lacked volume so Danny ignored it. Danny forced Chad back to the empty jacuzzi. Danny grabbed some rope along the way and used it to tie Chad&#39;s legs to the railing around the jacuzzi. Then he was forced to bend over.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Now for the next phase of the transformation.&quot; and began stripping off his clothes. When he was naked, he grabbed Chad&#39;s arms and began shoving them up Danny&#39;s butt. Chad&#39;s arms were too flimsy to resist. Then Danny lined Chad&#39;s head up and Chad&#39;s head also went up Danny&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
Chad briefly could see the inside of Danny&#39;s rectum until Chad&#39;s nipples made contact with Danny&#39;s butt. That&#39;s when the next phase of the transition began. Chad felt his head and arms transforming severely as Chad&#39;s body from the nipples down fused to Danny&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
When the transformation settled, Chad took stock. You&#39;ve heard of phantom limbs right? Chad had this vague, phantom feeling that he still had a head and arms even though he didn&#39;t feel the existence of any head or arms.<br />
<br />
Chad couldn&#39;t see or maybe he could see but his eyes were covered by something very thick that didn&#39;t let light through. Either way, Chad wondered if he even had eyes anymore. Similarly, he had no sense of smell or taste and wondered if his mouth and nose had also dissolved out of existence. Chad could still hear. Hearing and touch were the only senses Chad still had but as far as Chad could tell, he didn&#39;t have ears and couldn&#39;t figure out how he heard anything.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s nipples were now on the corner between Chad&#39;s chest and the back of Danny&#39;s legs. Although there were some other changes going on to Chad&#39;s internal organs, Chad&#39;s exterior from the nipples down hardly changed at all. Danny was a jocktaur and Chad was his back half.<br />
<br />
Danny untied his hind legs and started to walk around, checking out his new bod but this caused Chad to stumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta work with me, Chad. If you don&#39;t walk when I walk, you&#39;ll stumble and scrape up your knees. Just sync yourself to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad did and found this to be much easier. Chad figured out that he had zero control over Danny but he did still have limited control over himself. If he synced with Danny it would allow Danny to control his body which would coordinate the four legs for walking but Chad could choose not to sync with Danny in which case, he would control his own body. But without being able to see where he was going or detach from Danny anyway, it was just easier to stay synced to Danny most of the time.<br />
<br />
For a long time after that, Chad couldn&#39;t tell what Danny was up to. The atmosphere continued to feel like they were in the empty fieldhouse and Chad heard no other voices except Danny&#39;s. Danny was busy doing something. Chad felt cloth slide across him from time to time or he felt Danny&#39;s hand squeeze his ass occasionally. Danny really loved his new body and played with his new hind genitals. Chad tried to protest but the flimsy voice he used to have had now dissolved into no voice at all: no vocal chords, no tongue, no teeth, no lips. Chad wondered how he was still breathing and found that his control of his lungs was similar to his control of his legs. If Chad stayed synced to Danny, Chad&#39;s lungs filled at the same time Danny&#39;s did, but Chad could take back control of his lungs when he wanted to.<br />
<br />
Chad still had limited control over his body but not enough to resist Danny. If Danny wanted to play with his new hind parts, Danny pwned them completely.<br />
<br />
Chad felt socks and shoes put on Chad&#39;s feet. That was the only clothes put on Chad.<br />
<br />
Finally, after who knows how long, Chad could tell that Danny had opened a door and stepped them outside into sunlight and fresh air.</p>
