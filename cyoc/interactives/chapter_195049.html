<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you need?&quot; Lars asked, thinking he misheard.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Never been to a reindeer mating ceremony? I need a cloth thing, something that reminds you of Clyde or Eric but you don&#39;t mind not getting back.&quot; Rudy said as he stood in the living room. Fox houses were too small, he kept worrying his antler was going to poke a hole in the ceiling. Tom snapped his fingers as if he though of something perfect and headed off to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reminds me of them?&quot; Lars said looking around. &quot;I was usually naked around them.. oh!&quot; He walked over to the closet and pulled out a scarf. &quot;I think I wore this when we had our family dinner. Eric got me a new one so I don&#39;t need it anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot; Rudy said as he took the scarf and eyed it. Tom came back out with an old ratty t-shirt. More holes than shirt. Rudy took it and held it up, displaying the faded college logo on the front.<br />
<br />
&quot;You kept that?&quot; Lars said, looking over at Tom with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everywhere I went.&quot; Tom nodded to the t-shirt. &quot;I wore that on Lars and my first date back the first time I was up here. Since us meeting led to Clyde and Eric meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more.&quot; Rudy said as he took the t-shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re giving it up?&quot; Lars asked, seemingly torn about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? I don&#39;t need it to remind me of you anymore, I&#39;ve got you.&quot; The two foxes had started getting frisky before Rudy could even make it out the door.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ve got a good one.&quot; Michael said as he headed upstairs.<br />
<br />
Otso looked a little more thoughtful then headed over to a closet. He pulled out one of his white doctor coats and handed it over. &quot;I believe that&#39;s the one I was wearing when they came to see me when his changes started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael came back and held out the most garish piece of fabric Rudy had seen in his life. A silk tie in metallic gold paisley. Even Otso was looking at it as if it was a snake. &quot;Last present Eric got me before..&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I think Tess helped pick out something I&#39;d absolutely hate. Joke&#39;s on her, I kept it this whole time.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
Tess handed over the blouse she wore for the trip up here. &quot;We&#39;d have to go home to get something better, but I think it&#39;ll suit. What are you using them for again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Rudy said with a wink.<br />
<br />
Bix and Tag knew what was up, and handed over two straps. One blue and one red, they must have had them ready. &quot;Straps from the harnesses the first time we all pulled the sleigh together.&quot; Tag said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. You got your groomsman harness ready, Tag?&quot; Tag just grinned his response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost have everyone?&quot; Bix asked, rubbing his chin as he looked in the bag Rudy put their contributions into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost, still need my parents, and the rest of the team.&quot; He muttered under his breath. &quot;Oh well, Clara really wants to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mrs. Clause had only been too happy to allow them a room in the workshop for the ceremony. One of the better ones, with a view out over the town with all it&#39;s sparkling lights. The room had been festooned in evergreens and wooden chairs set up for all the guests. Though there was quite a bit of mingling and trying to figure out which side belonged to which of the grooms. The four men standing up at the front gave some indication. On one side was Rudy and Eino, both in formal harnesses, the former having a bit of trouble keeping his nose glow to a minimum. The other side had a dashing looking Tag and a less dashing looking Tom who looked and felt a little awkward in the formal reindeer harness, but had agreed to don it for his brother.<br />
<br />
Clyde and Eric had decided they would walk in together, and Eric peered down the aisle towards the front. &quot;Are you sure the elder will be here? Where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde made a soothing gesture, taking his soon to be mate by the shoulders. &quot;He promised me he would be here. He might just be having a little trouble with the formal harness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric scrunched his brow. &quot;Why would he have trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde sighed as the doors to the main side entrance admitted an older reindeer. &quot;There, see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked over at the stag. He was solid. Not the solid of Bix or Tag, most like a rock that had weathered many storms. His fur was a pure white that Eric couldn&#39;t recall seeing on any of the elders before, but he had the biggest rack of antlers Eric had seen on any reindeer. He did wear a formal harness, along with a pair of tailored red shorts, decorated with green. Strangely he walked in with Mrs. Clause on his arm. &quot;Who..?&quot; Eric started but then saw the collar around the elder&#39;s neck. &quot;No. It isn&#39;t. It can&#39;t be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde smiled. &quot;I figured I&#39;d ask him. I told him he could do it as himself, but he insisted. Our tribe has recognized him as sort of an unofficial elder for centuries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric stared back in disbelief. They were going to be married by Santa. Reindeer Santa. He took his place up at the front and Mrs. Clause took her seat. This prompted all the other guests but the four groomsmen to sit. Soft flute music began to play from off to the side of the room, courtesy of Bix, Eric had given him back the family flute, just for the day. They started up the aisle, arm in arm. Eric didn&#39;t let all those eyes turned on him bother him, he just focused on Clyde by his side.<br />
<br />
The stopped in front of Santa and the boss gave them a wink as they turned to face each other hand in hand. Santa cleared his throat, his voice even more booming in this form. &quot;We&#39;re here today to see two souls joined together as one.&quot; He started off formally. &quot;Though I&#39;m not sure how much closer these two souls could be.&quot; He added a little more informally, but Clyde smiled. &quot;I have the privilege of knowing every child from the day they are born until they reach adulthood, and a few special ones I keep tabs on beyond. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say these two were made for each other. Only once in my very long life have I seen two souls shine together so brilliantly.&quot; He cast his gaze over to Mrs. Clause for just a brief moment, getting a smile from her in return. &quot;And so I can say with confidence, these two have many long and happy years ahead of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have the.. ah yes!&quot; Santa&#39;s words prompted Rudy to produce the oddest piece of rope that Eric had ever seen. If rope was even the right word. It looked like someone had gone through a pile of rags and scrap fabric and woven it together. Then he started to see some familiar pieces of cloth. A hideous strip of gold paisley, another where he could just make out the poinsettias of one of Clara&#39;s dresses. Brightly colored strips that looked like they came off harness padding, and even what looked like a faded bit of a heather grey t-shirt, a bit of pure white he would have bet came off a doctor&#39;s coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;When reindeer join, we tie their hands together as a symbol of binding their souls together.&quot; Santa began to wrap the cord around their hands. &quot;Reindeer have a special tradition though. The cord is made from memories. Memories shared by those closest and dearest to the couple being brought together, and their good wishes for the future.&quot; He finished tying the knot with a flourish and set his hand a top it. &quot;By my power as a representative of the reindeer <i>neuvosto</i> and as guardian of the Arctic sanctuary. I pronounce these two, life mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde leaned in and kissed Eric as thoroughly as he had ever done, not really caring how many of their friends and family, or even their bosses, were watching.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Eric gasped as he felt Clyde come inside him, his own orgasm fading away into a pleasant warmth. He rolled over and fell on the bed next to Clyde, panting heavily. Their mating celebrations had lasted well into the night. Their most celebration celebration back home lasted quite a bit longer, but Eric thought he had finally worn Clyde out. Their mating cord now hung above them, laced through the two sets of antlers mounted above their bed. Just where it would stay. Santa had put some magic on it to make sure the intricate braid of cloth would stay as pristine as it was when tied around their hands.<br />
<br />
They lay in silence for a few moments. Just enjoying the fact they could slow down and enjoy each other&#39;s company for the next few months as the Workshop slowed down to let everyone catch their breaths. Clyde&#39;s hand came to rest on Eric&#39;s thigh as he rolled over to kiss his neck. &quot;Again? We already did it four times, <i>höpönassu</i>.&quot; Not that Eric made any moved to stop Clyde, he just wondered where the energy was coming from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; He murmured into Eric&#39;s ear. &quot;How about I make pancakes, then we can go for number five after we&#39;ve eaten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you clean up first.&quot; Both of their pelts were a bit of a mess from their evening activities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Number five in the shower then number six after pancakes?&quot; Clyde asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Eric just laughed. &quot;Fine. Go. I&#39;ll be right there, I just need to remember how to walk. I think you pounded that out of my skull.&quot;  Clyde locked muzzles with Eric for a long moment before getting out of bed. Eric amused himself by admiring Clyde&#39;s backside until he vanished into the bathroom and the sound of the shower started.<br />
<br />
Eric took a moment to stare up into the wooden rafters of his new bedroom. Of their bedroom. The tourists at the resort would all be heading back home tomorrow, except those who found more up here and decided to stay. He would have been on that train back home if he hadn&#39;t met Clyde. If he hadn&#39;t let a fox bully him into trying flying reindeer lessons. Such a strange turn of events, he thought to himself as he stretched out. Even more amazing was how much this place had come to feel like home. No, not this place. Clyde. He would be happy anywhere as long as his reindeer was by his side.<br />
<br />
Clyde popped out of the bathroom, in his hunky human shape with the form lock on his wrist. He still couldn&#39;t keep his human form when aroused. &quot;C&#39;mon. We haven&#39;t done it as both humans yet, and the shower will be easier without antlers.&quot; Eric laughed but got of the bed, letting his fur retreat into his skin as he walked over to Clyde. Fur was nice, but so was skin to skin. They kissed as they stepped into the shower, letting the hot water rush over them. Number five was off to a good start.</p>
