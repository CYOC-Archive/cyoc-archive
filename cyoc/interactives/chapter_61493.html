<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tucked away in a long forgotten alleyway in the town centre was a boarded up building. Once, it had been a shop called 'Spaceships and <br />
Spectres'. The sign still hung jauntily over the door, where no customer had entered in more than a year. However, tonight, four boys were sat <br />
in the basement, as they did most nights.<br />
<br />
They were huddled around a large table, sporting manuals, character sheets and pizza; Dungeons and Dragons. Though sometimes they played <br />
other role-playing games, sometimes they played War-hammer or retro video-games. They never LARPed, though. That was for nerds.<br />
<br />
Being in his mid-twenties, Matthew Spencer was the eldest of the group. He was skinny and tall and had the rocker look about him. He had a <br />
goatee and wore shirts with names of metal bands on them. When the shop was open, he had worked there, selling figurines, trading cards, <br />
board games and similar things. The owner, Warwick, had allowed Matthew and his friends to use the basement then, too. After he died, the <br />
shop closed down and was forgotten about. But while Matt still had the key, the boys had found no reason to go elsewhere.<br />
<br />
All the other boys were only sixteen, each being in same class at school. Really, they were friends of James Spencer, Matt's brother, but Matt <br />
didn't really have many friends is own age. James was perhaps a bit more mature than Matt, or more mature than he was at James' age. But they <br />
got on well and James didn't mind that Matthew wanted to share his circle of friends. But then he wasn't aware quite how Matt felt about Lee.<br />
<br />
Lee was a bit of a meek and shy character, scared of confrontation and wary of drama. With blue eyes and shaggy blonde hair, he had no idea <br />
how attractive he really was. And Matt, being openly bisexual, thought that Lee was adorable. And while James had never picked up on it, Matt <br />
could tell that Lee was gay. He had known the moment he'd met him but had never acted on it.<br />
<br />
There were a number of reasons. One, for example, was that he was wary of making things awkward and ruining games night for everyone. And <br />
that he wasn't sure how Lee would feel about the age gap. But the biggest trouble was because of how Matt discovered Lee was gay in the first <br />
place: because of the way Lee looked at Ted.<br />
<br />
Ted was perhaps the closest thing a nerd could be to a jock. He played on the school basketball team, though not with amazing talent, and <br />
while he enjoyed the games, it was clear he wasn't as interested as the others. James didn't seem to like Ted very much, but Lee had known <br />
Ted since they were both infants. There had been a time, sadly long gone, when they were inseparable. Nevertheless, it was clear to Matt at <br />
least that Lee was completely besotted with him. But Ted had a girlfriend, whom he never shut up about.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm taking her to Marco's, you know, the Italian place,&quot; Ted droned on, &quot;Girls love that shit.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mentioned,&quot; said James dryly, &quot;By the way, it's been your turn to attack for five minutes now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, I'm just saying,&quot; Ted replied, &quot;Means I won't be coming tomorrow night.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted finally rolled and the game resumed, though Ted continued to reveal his stellar strategy with women for some time. Matt cast a wary <br />
glance at Lee, who was staring fixedly at his character sheet. Keen to change the subject, Matt said, &quot;I'm a bit tired of D&amp;D.&quot; <br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; James nodded, &quot;Anyone want to play Warhammer?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; moaned Ted, who had never been very good at it.<br />
&quot;Magic?&quot; Lee suggested.<br />
&quot;No, I want to play something different,&quot; said James. <br />
&quot;There'll be thousands of games in the store room,&quot; Matt pointed out, &quot;Why don't we play a new game?&quot;<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The boys piled into the store-room. There were so many stacks of boxes there was barely space to stand. <br />
&quot;There's got to be something good in all this mess,&quot; said James.<br />
They began inspecting boxes, but if it wasn't obscure card games it was mostly figurines or toys. <br />
&quot;Sod's law,&quot; said Matt, &quot;The best stuff'll be at the back.&quot;<br />
&quot;You're the biggest,&quot; Ted observed, &quot;You go get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt couldn't argue with that, and reluctantly began to clamber onto the precarious pile of boxes.<br />
&quot;Be careful,&quot; Lee told him.<br />
A little elated that Lee was showing concern about him, Matt boldly replied, &quot;It's not as hard as it looks.&quot;<br />
At that moment, a posable Batman figure gave way and the stack Matt was perched on toppled over. He landed hard against another pile and <br />
the entire mess began to fall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot;<br />
The four of them watched as the organised clutter became much less organised. With seconds, the entire room had become the nerdiest <br />
bomb-site in history. But they did at least prove one theory true: that the best stuff would be at the back. Amidst the debris stood what <br />
looked like a medieval coffee table. It was built out of dark wood and decorated with ornate and classic carvings.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
Matt waded through the mess and studied the table. It was hexagonal in shape, and on each corner was a raised section with a series of slots. <br />
Wound around the centre in a tight spiral were a series of numbered squares, from 1 to 100. In the centre, another raised section on which was <br />
what appeared to be book. It was large, leather-bound tome and was bolted down. The cover read &quot;The Challenge of the Nightmare King.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like a game,&quot; Matt said, &quot;It looks a bit complicated.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nice!&quot; James said, &quot;Can we play?&quot;</p>
