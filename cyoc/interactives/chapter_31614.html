<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well this changes things” Johnson said “there is a newly changed Animorph out there……we should stay and try and catch her or leave now…….we have the samples and the data…….” The others watched him deliberate, finally he spoke. <br />
“Right, what we do is……..get out. We have risked enough company personnel tonight. I don’t want animorphs on my pay roll. Sgt!” The big man turned and saluted.<br />
“Sir!”<br />
“Get everything packed away and read to go in less than 3. If it’s not ready leave it”<br />
“Yes Sir!” the Sergeant moved off shouting orders and the choppers engines began to whine into life. <br />
Johnson turned to Anthony “time to leave!” he said with a grin. <br />
<br />
The two men walked back to the chopper, Anthony filling Johnson in on some of the detail of the Project. They reached the chopper just as there were some more bursts of gunfire. The Sergeant was shouting orders and the troops withdrew, firing occasionally as they came. All the troops where quickly gathered around the chopper, there was a terrified look to most of their faces but none broke ranks. The Sergeant was the last on board slamming the hatch shut he thumped the lock and the bird began to lift away. <br />
<br />
Down in the front Anthony watched as the bus grew smaller below him. Had he done the right thing? The bus began to roll forward and though the debris Transgene had left. <br />
“Feeling a little guilty?” Johnson said reading Anthony’s reaction<br />
“A little maybe..... But they would not feel so for me!” Anthony said with he hoped enough venom to satisfy his boss. Johnson smiled at his agent and poured another whisky.<br />
“To the future then!” he said toasting Anthony. With a heartfelt grin Anthony toasted his boss back <br />
“The future” he said and knocked back the fiery drink. <br />
<br />
Dr Gabby Jones watched the chopper pull away and emerged from her hiding place. The bus was slowly pulling away pushing through the tent debris that Transgene had left. She felt annoyed Harman had ordered her out, but her itching palm was testament that something was wrong. Nothing else felt different though. Without good light she could not examine herself. Quickly she considered her options- returning to the base was out especially if she was infected which also ruled out Otter Falls. Pulling out her gps she realised she was not that far from the mobile lab where this all started, that meant Team B where around somewhere- she could get shelter with them for now and the lab would have something for her cut. <br />
<br />
Jones waited for the bus to leave, then she checked all her weapons and tools again. She was as ready as she was going to be, and frankly had been in worse spots; at least the animorphs where not trying to kill her unlike the Russians had been. Jones adjusted her night sight goggles and headed back onto the road; she wanted a quick recon before she left; Transgene had left quickly and she might be able to get some information about who was leading their team. Jones picked through the debris- they had not left much, even taking all the personal belongings they had confiscated with them. Jones recovered some ammo for her pistol and a ration pack belonging to her company which immediately got her wondering where the Company personal from Checkpost Charlie had gone. <br />
<br />
The little car park had just been big enough for the Transgene military chopper and as she surveyed the area Jones quickly spotted the tyre tracks of two Hummers, they had been driven to the edge of the car park and off down a rough, nasty slope. Jones considered her options again, that was a survivable slope- just- but did she want to deal with survivors? Especially given the tingling in her palm? <br />
“Dammit” she swore to herself as loyalty to the Company won the argument again. Getting down the slope was easy with her training. The two smashed Hummers where next to each other; one had bounced off some boulders, overturned and was badly crushed. A quick look inside confirmed everyone was dead. The second vehicle was upright, if badly damaged. Jones could hear no one in the second but to be sure she banged on the side and was greeted with a low moan or two. <br />
“I am Company” she shouted and pulled at the back door which opened and a body slumped out, his head was gashed but otherwise alive. Jones pulled him out and then checked the others. <br />
<br />
Only two others had survived; a big guy with a tag of Boyce Cooper wearing a medics badge and a Corporal called Kody Dominick. The one form the back was Private Jed Patrick. Jones got them out and grabbed a first aid kit. She was really reluctant to treat their various cuts given she might be infected so she used smelling salts on the medic which quickly woke him<br />
“What....what...the fuck happened?” he said in a Californian accent once his eyes focused. <br />
“Transgene overran your checkpoint” Jones said “only you three survived”<br />
“Yeah. Fuckers rounded us up. Shot Commander Hale.....” he shook his head groggily.<br />
“Well it’s happened” Jones said coldly. “Deal with these two please” she ordered and stepped back taking up a guard position.<br />
“Where did you come from?” Cooper said. <br />
“I came down from the base. I am with Mr Dace’s team. I got off the bus I was escorting so Transgene would not shoot me” Cooper nodded and got to work on the other two using a flashlight. Jones resisted the temptation to have him look at her hand. No point exposing them to that risk yet.<br />
<br />
In short order the other two were back on their feet and clued in on everything Jones knew. It scared them- they had no idea animorphs where actually out here. Dominick was all for returning to base, but Jones overruled him the mobile lab was closer and would have communications. None of the men were happy but went along with her orders and formed up into a tight team as she led them into the woods.</p>
