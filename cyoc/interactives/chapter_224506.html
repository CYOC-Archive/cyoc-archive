<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frankie and Reese were still pretty amused with themselves when they went back to their apartment after the eclipse barbecue. The look on Lori&#39;s face was not one Frankie was going to forget any time soon and there were plenty of digital pictures to keep that in fresh in hir memory. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen Lori that baffled before,&quot; said Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when she divorced you, I highly doubt she would have expected to become a herm cow and want to have another herm cow&#39;s calves,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s something she wouldn&#39;t have seen coming,&quot; agreed Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand she could have gave you up that easily,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
The cheerful mood Frankie was became somber. &quot;Yeah, it was easier than I expected,&quot; shi said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to reopen that wound,&quot; said Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we&#39;re going to be life-partners, I might as well get it all off my chest,&quot; said Frankie, &quot;First off, to be fair, I don&#39;t Lori is really that bad a person. She just had a few preconceptions I didn&#39;t know about until after we married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you find out?&quot; asked Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I always wanted to have kids, but Lori didn&#39;t want to rush into motherhood. So I waited a few years. But when I approached the subject again, she kept putting it off. This went on for a bit until she eventually relented on the condition that we use a sperm donor,&quot; said Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she think you were sterile?&quot; asked Reese.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, apparently she managed to look at my medical records and found out about my extra Y chromosome,&quot; said Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;She read your medical records behind your back?&quot; asked Reese in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got rather miffed about that. She accused me of keeping a secret from her. I told her it wasn&#39;t a big deal. Tempers flared, we had a big argument. Then she said &#39;I don&#39;t want your criminally-inclined seed anywhere near my eggs.&#39; Our marriage fell apart pretty soon after that,&quot; said Frankie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow, I wouldn&#39;t think she&#39;d take that XYY chromosome that seriously,&quot; said Reese, &quot;I mean, that criminal inclination theory was disproved decades ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Earth was proven to be round centuries ago but some people still think it&#39;s flat,&quot; said Frankie. There was a pause before shi said, &quot;That&#39;s not a fair comparison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, there&#39;s willful ignorance and there&#39;s stubborn contrarianism,&quot; said Reese, &quot;You know, you can put your seed in me if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate that offer,&quot; said Frankie, &quot;But I think I want to prove to Lori that I can be a better mother than her first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can make a start on that,&quot; said Reese suggestively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re so incorrigible,&quot; said Frankie in a teasing tone. Shi had to admit that herm sex was very enjoyable. Shi enjoyed since hir conversion.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Outwardly, the only notable symptoms of having an extra Y chromosome should have just been a little extra height. But Frank did have quite a bit of physical machismo as well. For one thing, he was in pretty good shape, which paired well with his extra height. He was also a rather hirsute man with body hair of copious thickness over most of his body. This included a full beard. To most women (and several men), Frank was considered a very desirable example of masculinity. However, Frank was apparently too masculine for his ex-wife and he was going to correct that.<br />
<br />
It was quite simple to prepare a glass of milk to Frank&#39;s specifications. There was only a minor issue of getting a Holstein cow&#39;s milk in particular. Most people who became dairy cow Animalians go with the Swiss Brown that have been common ever since Blueberry and her fellow cows were uplifted. But Holsteins are very common milk cows so it didn&#39;t take long to get the right milk and treat it with the herm strain of the Animalia virus. Once Frank was in the changing room, he stripped down and drank the milk.<br />
<br />
Before long, the altered milk&#39;s effects made themselves known. Already a hairy man, Frank&#39;s body hair became even denser. Most of the new hair coming in was white. Most of his existing body hair thickened into black spots, though some of them were broken up by white areas of his new fur. It was particularly interesting when his face started pushing out into a muzzle. While his exposed face became covered in white fur, his beard remained as the fur covering his muzzle was black.<br />
<br />
But Frank didn&#39;t remain purely male for long. His nipples still stood out in his black and white fur, growing pinker and more sensitive. They became even more noticeable as mass started building up behind them. While his pectorals were not growing softer (if anything, they were growing more firm), they were soon overshadowed by the rising mounds of Frank&#39;s chest. Frank couldn&#39;t help but start fondling them, getting more aroused as his nipples grew bigger and even more sensitive. Quite suddenly, they both started leaking milk as mammary glands became active inside his breast tissue. But Frank wasn&#39;t losing all of his masculinity. His cock and balls, already well-endowed, were growing even large as they swelled to bovine proportions. Frank grasped his cock with one hand that now had hoof-like nails. feeling it get thicker as the head flattened like a bull&#39;s. Then complete his sexual transition, his internal organs shifted to make room for a new space for embryos, the entrance to which soon opened behind hir balls.<br />
<br />
Frank, now Frankie, slipped hir other hand inside hir new hole, letting out a moo of pleasure as shi did. The rest of hir bovine features were filling in as shi got closer to climax. Hir horns and tail sprouted, hir feet fully changed into hooves, and hir stomach developed four chambers to better process hir now fully-vegetarian diet. But Frankie was beyond the care of such details as shi reached the apex of hir pleasure. With a loud moo, shi came with both hir cock and hir pussy at the same time.<br />
<br />
When shi calmed down, Frankie took a look at hir new self. Shi made quite a sexy cow, hir black and white pattern making hir look more exotic than the uniform brown of the Swiss Browns. Shi also had quite a pair of hefty udders on hir chest. If the Animalian virus hadn&#39;t strengthened hir muscles, shi&#39;d have trouble standing up without support. &quot;I&#39;m probably a G cup now,&quot; shi said, noticing the higher, more feminine lilt of hir voice. However, shi was still male where it counts, even if shi was dual-equipped now. For a long time, Frank had dreamed about being a father. But now Frankie had the opportunity to be a mother, something that definitely appealed to hir now. &quot;I sure hope there&#39;s a single bull out there, another herm would be a bonus,&quot; shi said to hirself.</p>
