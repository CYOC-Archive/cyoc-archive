<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you mean, she&#39;s nothing but a pussy?!&quot; Brooke cries frantically in your mind.<br />
<br />
As calmly as possible, you answer her aloud, &quot;I mean, she&#39;s nothing but a pussy. There&#39;s literally nothing else left of her-- just a ball of flesh with female genitalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can feel Brooke becoming distraught over the news. &quot;Is... is she still... alive?&quot;<br />
<br />
You hold up Kira for a closer look. It feels so eerie to you, to be holding a ball with the consistency and texture of human skin. She... it?... can&#39;t weigh more than ten pounds now. &quot;I... honestly can&#39;t tell,&quot; you say. &quot;She doesn&#39;t have eyes or a mouth, or anything else, for that matter. She might be alive, but it&#39;s equally possible that she&#39;s pretty much just an inanimate sex toy at this point...&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel a humbling sensation in your groin area. Your penis-- Brooke-- is starting to recede. &quot;Oh, God... what have I done? This... this is all my fault...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby, relax,&quot; you say, trying to console her. You reach your hand down the front of your shorts and gently stroke her-- this time, less as a method of stimulation, and more as an act of sympathy. After all, in her current state, you really can&#39;t give her a hug. &quot;You didn&#39;t mean for this to happen. We were going to go back to the magic shop anyway. I&#39;m sure the woman there will know what to do. We&#39;ll have Kira back to her normal self in no time, you&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...,&quot; says Brooke, conceding for now. &quot;I sure hope you&#39;re right.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a pillowcase from the hall closet and gently place Kira inside-- you don&#39;t want to be seen in public carrying her around, after all. You also put the bracelet and the gold ring back into the jewelry box and make sure to take it with you, too, in case they will be needed. Then you get back in your car and drive to the magic shop. Once there, you step up to the counter and call out, &quot;H-hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
The attractive young Asian woman who sold you the jewelry set emerges from the back. Without missing a beat, she glances up at you, standing there by yourself, and says, &quot;Ah, you two again. I have submitted the order for that custom piece to reverse your... problem, but as I told your girlfriend yesterday, it won&#39;t arrive for some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know that,&quot; you say exasperatedly. &quot;I&#39;m... WE&#39;RE not here about that. Now we&#39;ve got a new problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper looks at you curiously. &quot;Oh?&quot; You look around to make sure the rest of the shop is empty. Once you are reasonably assured that you and the shopkeeper are the only ones there-- or the only complete human beings, at least-- you heave a sigh, set your strange bundle down on the counter softly and unwrap it. As soon as the shopkeeper sees it, she remarks, &quot;Oh. Oh, dear... But this... this isn&#39;t your girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you answer. &quot;It&#39;s her younger sister, Kira. Brooke is... well, you already know where she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper comes out from behind the counter to close the front entrance to the store, putting up a &quot;WILL RETURN&quot; sign with a clock face and closing the storefront curtains. Once the shop is closed up, she turns back to face you and asks, &quot;Alright, now, what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
You explain to the woman what had happened since your girlfriend&#39;s visit. Now you know how Brooke must have felt then. Explaining all of the intimate details to this stranger feels so humiliating-- especially when it comes to admitting the way that you cheated on Brooke with Kira, and the way that you and Brooke subsequently pushed Kira. Surprisingly, however, and to your great relief, the shopkeeper seems strangely nonjudgmental about you and Brooke&#39;s misdeeds. &quot;You... you don&#39;t seem surprised about any of this,&quot; you finally remark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in the magic business,&quot; she says with a polite smile. &quot;It is very difficult to surprise me. In fact, I have seen things similar to this before. A few years ago, one young lady who was browsing my shop was trying out a piece of merchandise, and accidentally turned herself into a breast. I found her there, just lying atop a pile of her clothing on the floor of the aisle.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is good news, despite not necessarily sounding like it-- the shopkeeper DOES have experience with this bizarre situation. &quot;Alright, well, um... is Kira... you know... is she still... alive?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper nods. &quot;Oh, yes. A simpler state of being than most might define as &#39;life&#39;... but her consciousness is still in there. She wouldn&#39;t be able to see or hear, of course, but she is probably still very sensitive to touch... and reducing herself so dramatically, I would imagine her ability to think is extremely narrow now-- probably limited to... well... performing her primary bodily function.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You mean sex,&quot; you say, looking down at Kira&#39;s open slit. Now that you look at her again, knowing this information, it does sort of seem to you like Kira looks... hungry. &quot;So is there any way to revert Kira to her normal self?&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile fades from the shopkeeper&#39;s face, replaced by a look of regret. By her expression, you can immediately tell that her answer isn&#39;t going to be good. &quot;You must understand something. I know it is difficult to accept, but this IS her normal self now. After spending more than half a day under the influence of the Transference Rings, the person you knew as Kira no longer exists. In her mind, she IS a vagina-- even if we restored her to the body that you recognize. This is why she did not automatically change back when the Body Changing Bracelet fell off of her. The bracelet reads its wearer&#39;s mental self-image, and interprets that as his or her default form. Even if she had a wrist, and could make her body whole again, once the bracelet came off of her, she&#39;d turn right back into this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, Kira&#39;s really stuck like this, forever?&quot; you gasp. Brooke&#39;s guilt is really beginning to affect you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; says the shopkeeper. &quot;I warned you about this. This is why you and your girlfriend MUST alternate with each other at regular intervals, more than twice a day, until your custom item arrives. If not, the very same thing could happen to either of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do we do now, if there&#39;s nothing we can do for her?&quot; you ask, trembling. It hadn&#39;t really fully hit you until that moment, but you and Brooke really are in a very precarious position. EACH of you has also experienced what it is like to temporarily lose your human identities to the lustful allure of existence as the other&#39;s genitalia. What if that was really made permanent, and Brooke was trapped as your penis? Or even more intimidating, what if you became trapped as her vagina?<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper can see how shaken you are, and thinks for a moment. &quot;Hmm... well, actually, I think there IS something you and your girlfriend can do for her-- though, I am not sure you will like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
A little embarrassed to be making the suggestion, the shopkeeper says, &quot;Stimulate her.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t believe what you&#39;re hearing... and neither can Brooke. &quot;Wait, what?!&quot; she screams in your head. You opt for a much more tactful reply of, &quot;Come again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stimulate her,&quot; repeats the young woman. &quot;It does not have to be actual sex. Rub her. Stroke her. Give her a toy to play with. Just... get her off, occasionally. It is the only sense of purpose she has left, and it will make her existence much more fulfilling. Otherwise, she she will just sit there, constantly craving to be touched but unable to do it herself. And if you would like... there is a spell I can cast on her, which will allow you to communicate with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
This, at least, is some comfort to you and Brooke. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is very simple,&quot; says the shopkeeper. &quot;All you will need to do is touch her, and you will be able to hear her and feel what she feels, in the same way that you can with your girlfriend right now. I feel I should mention, though, her communication skills at this point are likely to be very rudimentary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... We don&#39;t care,&quot; you answer. &quot;Do it, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper complies, holding one hand to Kira&#39;s skin and chanting an incantation. As she does so, you notice her face suddenly become flushed with desire. &quot;Oh... oh myyy. Her... &#39;appetite&#39; is very strong...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Kira, alright,&quot; remarks Brooke sardonically.<br />
<br />
The young woman looks up at you lustily. While her one hand is still holding onto Kira, you notice her other hand sliding up under her shirt to caress her own breasts. &quot;Unnngh...&quot; she moans. &quot;So... horny... all of a sudden... mmm... you&#39;re cute! You wanna get over here... and fuck me...?&quot;<br />
<br />
You gulp. &quot;Well, this is... um... unexpected...&quot;</p>
