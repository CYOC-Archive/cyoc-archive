<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few moments, he could hear some laughter and then the sound of them going about their job of fixing the outdoor pool commenced. Will sighed slightly, chuckling a little, it was embarrassing but very insightful into the eyes of the peeped. Closing the blinds by pulling on the string from the floor, Will stood up again, shaking his head, he stripped off the skimpy clothes, Will’s hand went to his damp crotch. Between the clothes and getting caught like that, he was feeling really turned on. Will grabbed the camera, turning it off, he shook his head. “More later…” He opened the dresser drawer to find something to wear, a thought striking him, smiling mischievously. <br />
<br />
He found a black string micro-bikini, he’d seen Eva wear it on more than one occasion and it was definitely a great spectacle. The spandex/nylon fabric rested low on Will’s curvy hips and in front, a hint of Will’s landing strip could be seen upon inspection. However, the suit made the tan-lines clearly visible now. The bikini hugged Will’s cheeks, but still covered him generously enough to be modest. The triangle patches of the matching top did little if anything to hide his bust, showing the tan-lines around his breasts quite dramatically.<br />
 <br />
Next he pulled a white cabana dress over him, it covered him up but was sheer and flowy, it hugged around his chest. Looking into the mirror, he smiled warmly into the reflection. “This girl will make a guy’s heart stop, whoever she ends up with is one lucky guy.” He turned away, grabbing a pair of sandals from the closet, he walked over to the nearby phone to make a quick call to Jake.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” A cautious voice asked through the receiver. “JAKE!” Will chuckled after he yelled. “It’s just me! Listen, thanks for being a pal and telling me about the pool guys, they’ll probably sabotage the pool now so they can get a second show.” Jake laughed a little as Will joked, realizing he must’ve been giving them one great time. “Sorry man, I forgot, they usually just show up when they want to anyway. Well, don’t need to tip them anything then.” Will laughed, nodding slightly. “Alright, so, what did you find out about the vial?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right, the vial. Well, lets see, it’s supposed to be an enhancer of some kind. Whatever part of the body you put it on it will increase it’s abilities. You are supposed to use only a small amount for minor effect, more for more obviously, and you’re supposed to stay out of contact with anything or anyone for two whole minutes. Which is precisely what happened to you, my friend.” Jake said with certainty, leaving out the part that him and Debbie had already given it a test ride last night. “It doesn’t say anything about returning the body to its original form, so we’ll have to go to the shop still and check it out.”<br />
<br />
Absent mindedly while Jake was talking, Will had put lotion over his legs and arms to make them silky smooth. He had moved down the stairs after putting on a nice pair of sandals. “Damn, that sucks, if I hadn’t bumped into that jogger I would’ve been Mr. Perfect.” Will sighed. “Is the bottle in the house?” “Yes, it’s in the safe, my personal one, not even Debbie knows the combo. When I get home we’ll grab it and figure this all out man, but I gotta get back to work, have fun, you sound hot…um, your voice I mean…later.” The phone clicked as Jake hung up.<br />
<br />
Will thought as he stood at the edge of the stairs, he was the enhanced version of the girl, which meant all over enhanced, he feared what that could entail. Will walked by the patio doors, waving to the guys still working on the pool, they waved back eagerly. Will chuckled, they were both kind of handsome, one was younger, the other in his early thirties. Looking to the time Will realized he still had a whole five hours before anyone else even showed up at the place. He was hoping to get a tan but the guys outside were making it a little difficult. An idea sent goosebumps down his spine, smirking, he walked around the poolroom, grabbing the tanning oil and a towel.<br />
<br />
Thinking that this would be some mild entertainment for the day, after all, he would be back to normal come this time tomorrow. Will opened the door, walking out toward the pool they were working on. “Oh, hi once again boys.” He smiled warmly as they smirked at him. “I hope you don’t mind, but I need to work on my tan, I’m off school for a few weeks and I only have a few days to enjoy this natural sun.” The guys looked at each other, nodding in unison. “Oh that’s fine miss, we won’t bother you. Sorry about earlier, it’s just…you’re well…” Will just smiled coyly and nodded as he set his things onto the side table near the lawn chair. Watching the guys getting back to work, Will slinked the sundress down, wiggling his hips a little allowing it to drop to the deck.<br />
<br />
The pool guys got caught staring at Will’s chest as it bounced, Will acted like he wasn’t paying attention when really he was testing what buttons to push on these guys. Taking a seat on the lawn chair, Will laid back slightly, grabbing the oil, he slowly rubbed it all over his exposed skin, making sure to get every inch, say for the back. He laid back, closing his eyes, every few moments he would open an eye to check what the guys were up to. Once even catching the younger worker snapping a photo from his camera phone. Will tried not to chuckle as he stumbled backwards, embarrassed that he was caught with his hand in the cookie jar. “You cheeky fucker…” He smirked. “Okay, since you were being bad, you have to do me a favor.” Will motioned for him to come over to her. <br />
<br />
Travis, the younger of the two men slowly approached the girl, from a distance she was hot, but as he got closer to her, Travis could help but get turned on by the sight. Her smooth velvet like legs and thighs begged to be touched and caressed. “I’m Travis, sorry again…didn’t mean to stare.” He lied through his teeth, he wanted to stare, watching her gorgeous blue eyes study him for a moment. She sat up, turning her back to him, her legs coming over the side of the chair. “Sit, it’s alright, I’m flattered, my name is Wendy.” Her voice was sexy, Travis thought to himself and a hot name too. She handed him the oil, as she swiftly undid the back of her bikini, Wendy held the front firmly in place.<br />
<br />
“If you would be so kind, since you wanted to peep, you can help.” Will smirked, knowing these guys could be putty in his hands under the right circumstances. Hearing the sound of him squeezing the oil into his hands queued Will that it was coming. Travis hands felt wonderful on his body, working it into his skin like he’d done it hundreds of times. Will could feel Travis hands linger as they went to the sides of his chest, obviously coping a feel as he did. Surprisingly, Will just smiled, he liked how he’d used so many of the same kind of ‘moves’ this guy was using, in the past, most of them really obvious. Without a word, Travis undid the tie holding the straps around his neck, it didn’t effect him holding the top in place, only that now there was nothing but his hand to hold it there. “You have such strong hands…” Will found himself doling out to him.<br />
<br />
Travis smirked, knowing full well this girl was having a good time, and hell he was enjoying it too. “Thanks…” He responded to her accolade, she told him to hold on. Catching a glimpse of her side boob as she leaned forward, she laid the chair out flat. Lying herself on top of it, on her stomach. Letting loose her grip on the top, the sides fell to the flat surface, showing off more of her breasts. She pulled her bikini bottom up, making it more of a thong, looking back up to him. “Trying to get rid of the tan lines, huh? I think they’re sexy myself…but if it’s what the lady wants.” Travis asked. Wendy just smirked and put her head down on her arms. Travis massaged more oil onto her skin, his hands groping her perfect rear. “Keep it PG, cowboy.” Wendy yelled out, Travis nodded. “Right…sorry…”<br />
<br />
For a while Will just sat there in the sun, taking in the rays, he hadn’t noticed the guys had finished the pool and were pretty much just hanging out. An hour must’ve passed with him out like a light. Will tied the top back in place before he sat up, looking to the pool guys. “Sorry I don’t have anything for you guys…but thanks for everything. I’m sure Jake took care of the bill.” Travis just smiled over at him. “Alright, Wendy, you’re all set, pools ready to go, levels are all checked.” Will nodded. “Tell you what, come by this time in a say two days, maybe we’ll have a little day party.” They smirked at each other, exchanging some glances. Will knew that he’d be back in his body by then and no one would be the wiser, no party, nothing. They waved as they walked out the back way toward the driveway. “Phew, only a day as a girl and I’m already having fun…almost makes me want a couple more days. Oh well, maybe I can try it again in the future.” <br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for the sound of the truck pulling away before he stood up and promptly stripped the bikini off. Another hour or so in the sun and then he’d have to find something productive to do. Will oiled up the now bare skin, his hands lingered in those areas, feeling aroused, still…Travis hands felt better. “No…gross…man this has some drawbacks, but as long as I still like girls…I’ll be fine.” Placing some sun goggles on, Will leaned back and once more passed out, he woke up a half-hour into it and flipped over onto his stomach again, not worrying to block hide his nudity, there wasn’t a soul for almost a mile.<br />
<br />
Though he liked the feeling of warmth the sun gave his skin, but it was time to go for a quick dip before finding something to do. Standing from the chair, Will took a quick swan dive into the pool, the feeling of the chilly water cooling his skin sent chills through him. Will was surprised that he had to find a slightly different way to swim now, his body mass and natural abilities were greatly different. But slowly he manage, waiting in the water, his nipples ached from being so hard so suddenly. He took a few laps before finally getting out, Will took the opportunity to give his water-clad body. Watching the beads of water streaming down the length of his stomach. “Looks like it worked a little bit.” Will commented about the tan-lines, they looked much less white, but still visible. <br />
<br />
He smirked, satisfied that he’d seen enough, he rushed to his towel for warmth as he patted himself off, then pulling the sheer sundress up his nude body. Grabbing everything, he double checked, to make sure there was no evidence to be seen of him ever being there, Will made his way back to the pool house. Looking to the time. “It’s only 1:00? What am I going to do for the next four hours…”</p>
