<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I know what I want to do,” said Carrie.<br />
<br />
She set about programming the remote as Todd stood there trying to figure out a way to stop her, and then she aimed it at him and pressed the button.<br />
<br />
“Carrie…” said Todd, but it was too late.<br />
<br />
For the first time, Todd felt the remote changing him. He had been afraid to try it out on himself before. That’s why he was testing it at the library. Now, the strange sensation of changing shape was all over him. He could feel his clothes loosening on him. Again, Carrie appeared to be growing taller in front of him, but this time he realized it was he who was getting shorter.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Carrie,” he pleaded. “Why are you doing this?”<br />
<br />
The shrinking seemed to accelerate a little, and he began to feel weaker like his muscles were disappearing. He looked down at his hands. The sleeves of his shirt were so long on his arms now that they covered them. He pulled the sleeves back and examined his hands. They looked smaller than before and more delicate, more like a boy’s hands than a man’s.<br />
<br />
“You’re making me younger?” he asked, and noticed that his voice had taken on the tone of a squeaky teenager. He reached up to touch his face to feel the last traces of his stubble fade away as he entered his early teen years.<br />
<br />
Carrie smiled. “Turnabout is fair play,” she said.<br />
<br />
Already, he was shorter than her chest. He looked up at her face past her massive breasts.<br />
<br />
“Carrie…” he started to say, but stopped when he heard his high-pitched prepubescent voice. He must have been about 12 years old.  Just then, his pants and underwear dropped to the floor.<br />
<br />
He was about to pull them up again, but Carrie said, “Don’t bother. Your shirt covers you up well enough now.”<br />
<br />
It was true. And, it was another indication of how small he had become. She absolutely towered over him now. He looked up at her, fearful of this huge older woman who now controlled him.<br />
<br />
He was about eye level with her belly button now, and he guessed he was about 10 years old, maybe younger. His shirt hung loosely on him covering his whole body down to his knees. In a way, he was thankful that he didn’t have to see how much he had diminished because of the remote. He was afraid to look at his skinny, immature child body. Still, he could see his feet below him. They looked smaller and more childish, like his hands had. He guessed they would be a kid’s size five. Briefly he imagined a pair of those shoes with the flashing lights in the heels.<br />
<br />
And, still he shrunk. He passed back through his early grade school years, becoming even smaller and more feeble, while in front of him Carrie appeared ever more gigantic and, he shuddered to think it, more matronly. For a moment, he remembered the experience of looking up at one of his aunts when he was a small boy, fascinated by her large breasts under her shirt. He was about that age again. Just a little boy next to an adult woman with large breasts. This time, no shirt.<br />
<br />
And then, as suddenly as it began, the change stopped.<br />
<br />
He was now face-level with another interesting part of her anatomy, her crotch. He looked up at her again, barely able to see her face beyond her incredible boobs, which seemed so much larger to him now that he was so small. She absolutely towered over him now, seemingly over 10’ tall compared to his normal height.<br />
<br />
“That’ll do it I think,” she said, looking satisfied. “How do you like being five-and-a-half years old?”<br />
<br />
Five years old? Todd thought. I’m a preschooler now!<br />
<br />
He looked down at his body covered under his baggy old shirt, which now hung down to his ankles. He guessed he was several inches shorter than four feet tall. He couldn’t have weighed more than 50 pounds, less than a third of his old weight.<br />
<br />
She lowered the remote, and for a moment Todd thought to try and take it from her now that it was closer to him. In truth, she now had nothing to fear from Todd physically. Even if Todd had tried to take the remote from her, he was far too puny now to wrestle it out of her grip. He thought that maybe he could trick her into putting it down somewhere. Then, he might be able to get a hold of it and sneak away with it. But, other than that, there was nothing he could do to help himself. As a small boy now, he was at her mercy. She was completely in control now.<br />
<br />
Carrie gave him a comforting smile and reached down her very large empty hand. With it, she held his head under the chin and tilted his round boyish face up to look at her. He felt so tiny in her hand.<br />
<br />
“Aww, aren’t you so cute now?” she said. “You even have freckles!”<br />
<br />
She lifted her thick pointer finger to touch his little upturned button nose and gave it a little playful wiggle.<br />
<br />
“Carrie…” he said again, but the squeaky voice that came out of him this time sounded more babyish than boyish. He was having a hard time adjusting to his changes. Everything seemed so different to him. He felt so out of place all of the sudden.<br />
<br />
Then, she put her massive hand on top of his head and mussed his hair up a bit.<br />
<br />
“You are just so sweet, Cutie.” She smiled at him, and then grabbed his shirt by the shoulders. “Okay, little guy, let’s see what you look like now under that grownup shirt.”<br />
<br />
She pulled his shirt up. For a moment he was lifted bodily off the ground. He let out a little yelp, and then he lifted his arms over his head to let them slip out of his too large shirt. His feet met the ground again, and he felt the cool air of the library on his naked flesh.<br />
<br />
Looking down, he saw his pale boyish body. How tiny he seemed now. His hands were so small and babyish. The fingers were skinny little things and appeared very weak. His body was all skin and bones, except around the waist where he could see a slight baby fat tummy. It seemed there was no muscle on him at all. From his little feet to his bony chest he saw that all of his skin was soft, smooth and hairless. In particular, his crotch seemed especially bare. Before, his member had been a respectable 5” soft. Now, it was a tiny little one-and-a-half inches, just barely half an inch wide. Below it were the faintest hints of testicles that were years away from dropping now.<br />
<br />
Carrie was looking in the same place. “Aww,” she said again. “Looks like your Lincoln Log has become a Tinker Toy.”<br />
<br />
He quickly covered himself up with both hands.<br />
<br />
“Change me back!” he demanded, but it was far from a threatening statement coming from such a small boy in such a squeaky little voice.<br />
<br />
She laughed at him trying to act tough. “I don’t think so,” she said. “First, I want to have a little fun with you… and with the remote.”<br />
<br />
“Carrie, please just change me back, and we can go do something else together. Come on, don’t you want me to be grown up?” he said, trying to reason with her.<br />
<br />
“Nope,” she said and smiled. “It’s my turn to be in control…” She looked at the remote. “Literally.”<br />
<br />
Then, the smile faded from her face, and Carrie pointed the remote at him, threateningly.<br />
<br />
“If you try anything,” she said, standing tall over him like a scolding teacher. “Don’t think I won’t leave you that age.”<br />
<br />
Todd took a step back in fear, still covering his tiny crotch. He believed her. There was nothing he could do but listen to her. For now, he would have to play along with whatever she wanted to do to him.<br />
<br />
What would she do next? he wondered.</p>
