<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna:<br />
<br />
I was glad that Miss Ketcher wouldn't leave me alone tonight. I wanted to be held by someone. I think that Miss Ketcher is blaming herself for not being able to bring my mom back. She did what she could and tried to bring my mom back.<br />
<br />
I couldn't figure out why my mom did that. I know that she was really conservative and really religious. She thought that if you were different than what the Bible said you should be it was a sin. Being gay was a sin. Independent women were a sin. Even sex was a sin if it was done for any other purpose other than procreation.<br />
<br />
Suicide was a sin so why had my mom done it. Could she have really thought that being Bonded was a sin? But then again suicide was a sin. Why did my mom do it?<br />
<br />
I fell asleep with these thoughts in my head.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Anna:<br />
<br />
I was walking around the compound in my nightshirt with my mom's crystal in my hand. It was strange that no one was looking at me funny. They should be since I was walking around with only my nightshirt on. Well my panties too but I hoped no one could see them.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I heard my mom's voice say &quot;Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, is that you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna&quot; my mom said again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; I called. &quot;Can you hear me!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to me Anna&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you!?!&quot; I called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to me Anna&quot; my mom said. &quot;Follow your heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
I started wandering around some more trying to follow my heart. Where was my mom?<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow your heart Anna&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying Mom!&quot; I called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come and be with me Anna&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
I was starting to get scared. Where was my mom? I wanted to find her. I had to find her. I had wandered all over the compound but I couldn't find my mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow your heart Anna&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'M TRYING!&quot; I shouted. &quot;WHERE ARE YOU MOM!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where I am&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
I looked down at my mom's crystal and I suddenly knew where I could find my mom. I hurried to the spot where our crystals came to us.<br />
<br />
When I got there I said &quot;Ok Mom! I'm here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad that you're here&quot; my mom said right behind me.<br />
<br />
I spun around and hugged my mom. &quot;I'm so glad that you're alive Mom&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not&quot; my mom said. &quot;I aged myself so much that I can't possibly be alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I be talking to you then?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are almost ready to cross over&quot; my mom said. &quot;All you need to do is take the final step.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same step that I took&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what you did is a sin&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a sin if you die of old age&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aged yourself to sixty-five billion years though&quot; I said. &quot;You knew that it would kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still died a natural death&quot; my mom said. &quot;I'm in Heaven and I want you to be with me. Though I think that you should be what you were born as. Go ahead and take the final step. You hold my crystal and you can use it. Just say 'male, sixty-five billion' and you'll join me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; I said. &quot;What about Miss Ketcher? She was really sad that you died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't matter&quot; my mom said. &quot;She'll never be your mother. I am your mother. I gave birth to you. Please, I want you to be with me. Take that final step.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do that to Miss Ketcher&quot; I said. &quot;It would kill her if I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will get over it&quot; my mom said. &quot;Don't you want to see Heaven?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do&quot; I said. &quot;Though I'm not ready to see it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're already on your way&quot; my mom said. &quot;You found me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't take that step Mom&quot; I said. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
I did as my mom said and looked at her. She didn't seem to be any different than she was before she became Bonded. That didn't last long though as my mom started to age quickly. I stared in horror as she became an old lady. She didn't stop at being an old lady but kept going and started to decompose. She did stop when there wasn't much skin left on her body. There was bone showing where the flesh had decayed that far.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter dear?&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're really... old&quot; I said. &quot;So old that you're in the... grave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come and join me Anna&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late&quot; my mom said. &quot;Take a look at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at myself like my mother said. I was horrified to discover that my nightshirt and panties were gone. I was completely naked right out in the middle of the compound where anybody could see. That wasn't the worst part though. I was aging. I figured I was about eleven when my nipples started to change. They became a little larger and stuck out a bit. My breasts continued to grow as I aged. My height also changed as I aged. I grew hair on my legs, on my<br />
armpits, and on my crotch. My hair didn't seem to change much.<br />
<br />
When I reached eighteen my development stopped. My breasts were a c cup as far as I could figure. I stood about five foot tall. I had a nice womanly figure. I didn't stop there though.<br />
<br />
I continued to age passing into my thirties where my breasts began to sag. In my forties I was experiencing hot flashes. In my fifties I noticed that my hair was going gray and my skin was starting to get noticeably wrinkled. In my sixties I started to stoop a bit as my spine curved a bit and my hair was completely gray. My seventies brought about white hair and very wrinkly skin.<br />
<br />
I didn't make it to my eighties as my body started to decay. My skin started to turn leathery and peel off. My hair started to fall out. A few of my teeth fell out. I became really thin as my flesh just dropped off piece by piece.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've taken the final step and are joining me&quot; my mom said. &quot;I just wish it was as a boy instead of a girl but I'm not going to be picky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This can't be happening!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it is&quot; my mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; I nearly screamed. &quot;No! No! No! NO! NO! NO!...&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Anna:<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOOOO!&quot; I cried as I woke up and sat upright, my heart pounding.<br />
<br />
Miss Ketcher hugged me and said &quot;It's alright. It was just a bad dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seemed so real&quot; I said once my heart had slowed down a bit. I took a quick look at myself and found that I was still an eight year old girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, it might help to tell me what your dream was&quot; Miss Ketcher said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's scary&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what&quot; Miss Ketcher said. &quot;You tell me your dream and I'll tell you mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
We told each other our dreams. Miss Ketcher's dream seemed to be one of guilt. What about my dream though? Did I really want to join my mom? I didn't think so but that dream had to come from somewhere. I didn't like what had happened in my dream. It seemed like the crystals could tell what was a dream and what was a conscious thought as I had held my mom's crystal while I slept. I didn't want to take any chances though so I put my mom's crystal on Miss Ketcher's nightstand. When I laid back down I quickly fell back<br />
asleep.</p>
