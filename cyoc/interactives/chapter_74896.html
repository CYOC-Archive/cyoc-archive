<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From straight loner to gay orgy in a matter of hours. All I wanted was to go back to my normal life. But I think what scared me most about the <br />
prospect was, with Runt's magic working on me, I knew I would enjoy it.<br />
<br />
What else could I do? I had to go through with it.<br />
<br />
Runt led me out of the main room and down a quiet corridor. At the end of it was a large, golden door, like the entrance to an egyptian tomb. <br />
Runt nudged me towards it. My heart was pounding as I unlocked it with key Jean-Pierre had given me.<br />
<br />
I stepped outside onto a grassy pasture, though I could have sworn we were in the middle of the building. And in the middle of New York, but <br />
now I could see out to the mountains on the horizon. The clear sky was filled with stars, none of which I recognised. It looked like we were on a <br />
small island, surrounded by calm ocean. I looked back at the door we'd come through. I could still see the corridor through it, but on this side <br />
the door was just a gateway. <br />
<br />
I could hear voices nearby. A short walk away was a large, wooden gazebo. I could see coloured lanterns and moving figures. I could smell fruit.<br />
<br />
Runt could tell I was nervous. He held my hand and squeezed it. <br />
'I promise you,' he said. 'You're going to enjoy yourself.'<br />
It was uncharacteristic of Runt to be this comforting. I don't know if it was his magic working overtime on me or if it was genuine, but I really <br />
loved him at that moment. I felt actually fond of him, and knew he was fond of me. If it was all just magic, I hoped it would last. He led me <br />
towards the gazebo.<br />
<br />
The gazebo clearly had sex in mind with its construction. The floor was covered with thick persian rugs. There were no seats, just piles of large <br />
and small cushions. In the centre, a low table covered in fruit and wines.<br />
<br />
There were already a about a dozen creatures there. I saw fairies and demons and mythical beasts of all types and gender. But my eye was <br />
drawn to a burly minotaur, laid on his side on one of the larger cushions. He looked more like the greek legend than modern day fantasy. His <br />
body was entirely human, though it did look a bit greek too. He was broad, with an attractive balance of bulk and muscle, and had well-tanned <br />
skin and thick, dark body hair. His head was entirely bull, though, with large horns and dark fur, and a long, cow tail flicked playfully behind <br />
him. The way he was laid, it was as if he was deliberately showing off his massive cock and balls. He smiled at me at me and Runt walked in. <br />
Perhaps there was some affinity between half breeds like us.<br />
<br />
Me and Runt sat down beside each other on another cushion. Beside us was a woman with long black hair, who gave us a sly glance. With  It <br />
was only on second glance that I realised she had golden hair on her legs and a lion's tail. Half lion, half human. A sphinx, perhaps, only not <br />
quite like the ones I'd seen. She still had her human figure, large breasts and a lithe waist, but she was lion from the waist down, like a lion <br />
version of a faun. In my current state, I didn't find her attractive but knew I would if Runt would relinquish his spell on me.<br />
<br />
A moment later, Jean Pierre appeared. He stood before us.<br />
'Greetings all,' he said. 'Thank you all for coming, whether you've been here many times or if this is your first.'<br />
He smiled at me.<br />
'As ever, there is no point to intercourse without foreplay, so if you've not partaken of the wine or the fruit yet, please do.'<br />
<br />
All the other creatures, it seemed, were already up to speed with how things went, so only me and Runt took something. He grabbed a glass of <br />
wine and handed me a bunch of grapes. I ate them nervously. Instantly, I understood why. All my doubts and fears and inhibitions vanished. I <br />
didn't feel drunk, my mind was clear, but I felt completely at peace. I was no longer ashamed about being naked. In fact I was proud of my <br />
body. My cute furry legs and my rugged chest hair and my frankly delicious cock. <br />
<br />
Everyone else looked beautiful too. The men and the women equally. And not just in a lustful way, though that was certainly on my mind. But <br />
all of their other features were just as important. The minotaur's hairy toes, the sphinx's pert little ears, Runt's cute, fuzzy belly button, all of <br />
these were just as sexy as their respective cocks and boobs.<br />
<br />
'Excellent,' said Jean-Pierre. 'Now, I will have my chance with all of you, so don't be impatient. And to start things off, have a gift.'<br />
And then Jean-Pierre removed his loincloth. He was completely naked.<br />
<br />
It hit the crowd like a wave. Arousal spread throughout the gazebo. Before I'd even realised what had happened, my cock had gone completely <br />
hard. I wasn't embarrassed. If anything, it was funny. <br />
<br />
And Jean-Pierre's cock was magnificent. Perfect, as if it had been sculpted. Large, but not ridiculous. Tanned and smooth, yet rugged and a <br />
little hairy. The crowd gave polite applause.<br />
'Let us begin.'<br />
<br />
A hand touched my shoulder. 'May I?' said a voice.<br />
It belonged to...</p>
