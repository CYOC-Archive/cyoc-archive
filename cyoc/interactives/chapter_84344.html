<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in Fee City Talia and Midnight made their way into the one building they felt they could make some progress in: the Police Station. Ronnie&#39;s scent went over a great many parts of Fee City and while they had the noses to track him, doing so would have the potential difficulty of looking odd and having to explain themselves to all the other Kats. And finding Ronnie was important. They had stumbled into him at the old Chakat Industries Building, but he had escaped because his scent was all over the place. The two were greeted at the front desk by a lion Chakat, who despite having a female torso, as all Kats did, had a very impressive mane that Talia had to admit was fairly sexy looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; the lion Chakat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might... I am Talia... the Sphinx... and this is my friend Midnight,&quot; Talia spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shi isn&#39;t your soughter?&quot; the lion Chakat wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, shi is not,&quot; Talia answered, remaining silent on the fact that shi was waiting until Midnight turned eighteen to actually court hir, as shi didn&#39;t want anyone to think shi was robbing the cradle, though Talia also knew that if shi took anyone who was already an adult shi would still be robbing the cradle, given how old shi truly was. &quot;We&#39;re here with the UN mission...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The UN Mission?&quot; the lion Chakat asked, &quot;what would the UN want with Fee City?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The one that is responsible for hunting Li Sang and dealing with the various Kat outbreaks,&quot; Talia began, &quot;We...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a bit late to save us, we&#39;re all Kats here, and Li Sang was never in Fee City, and according to the news, he&#39;s been caught,&quot; the lion Chakat answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, friends of ours caught him,&quot; Midnight spoke up, &quot;We&#39;re actually hear to help sort through things with regard to taking down Li Sang&#39;s network so that way it doesn&#39;t run around like a chicken with its head cut off. Part of that would be find and catch a man who had essentially spied on Maurice Chakat and Katherine Snow when they were running the old Chakat Industries here...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chakat&#39;s face soured almost immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were names I thought I&#39;d never hear again,&quot; the lion Chakat spoke firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They had no real malicious or malevolent desire,&quot; Talia commented, &quot;Misguided perhaps, but not malicious or malevolent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, and we&#39;ve all gotten used to being Kats... and I&#39;d think a good many of us would never voluntarily go back if a &quot;cure&quot; ever appeared,&quot; the lion Chakat answered, &quot;but we still did not get a choice as to whether or not we would get to be Kats. My husband and I had that day off more than six years ago when a Chakat came in with a buddy and had me pinned to the ground and that is when I became a Kat... by the time I got my mind back and burned through all the lust that I&#39;d felt after transforming, I&#39;d raped and transformed at least five more people... so you can understand that while they weren&#39;t wanting to be evil, the results of their misguided actions were not good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have realized that and have helped create the vaccines we&#39;ve been using to stop the outbreaks,&quot; Midnight pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is good,&quot; the lion Chakat replied, &quot;but it should not have taken seeing their outbreak cause trouble for them to learn that they would have done much better to give us a choice. If knowledgeable of what being a Chakat would like, and an open description of the love I&#39;d feel as a Chakat... I might have very well willingly become a Kat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia and Midnight decided to let that go there. The Chakat didn&#39;t seem to hate Maurice and Snowy, and did seem willing to let them work to stop the continued use of outbreaks to spread chaos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, the spy supposedly was working with Li Sang and may have some knowledge on Li Sang&#39;s organization,&quot; Talia spoke, &quot;we need to find him...&quot;<br />
<br />
The lion Chakat sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll take you to the chief, I&#39;ll take you to hir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia and Midnight followed. They were lead into an office where a Russian Blue Chakat was seated at hir desk looking over some paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark... an Agent Talia from the UN&#39;s Kat Outbreak Control Offices is here to speak with you,&quot; the lion Chakat spoke.<br />
<br />
The Russian Blue Chakat, Mark, looked up and see Talia and Midnight. Shi then nodded, while the lion Chakat turned and left and Talia and Midnight moved in and sat down on their haunches.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; Mark asked, &quot;Fee City&#39;s outbreak was well over six years ago, and to my knowledge, both Maurice Chakat and Catherine Snow have been trying to mitigate their sins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are... but we believe that they had a spy working for Li Sang or who knew Li Sang might be was involved in both the Fee City outbreak or at least in allowing the Virus to be passed on to other scientists leading to the Paris outbreak and the ones we&#39;ve been combating,&quot; Talia explained, &quot;With Li Sang now captured, we&#39;re trying to catch and dismantle the network he created.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Li Sang hasn&#39;t been here,&quot; Mark answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we know,&quot; Midnight spoke up, &quot;but his spy has... and his spy... he... is Ronald Chakat... Maurice&#39;s brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight then held up the journal that they had found for proof.<br />
<br />
&quot;We ran into him at the Old Chakat Industries building,&quot; Talia commented, &quot;He is still human and has apparently been camping there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t catch him?&quot; Mark asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He ran off before we could catch him,&quot; Talia spoke, &quot;We don&#39;t think he was entirely evil and that at heart he wanted to help his brother, but let jealousy and other things get in the way. We want to catch and take him back to Janace...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;s still human?&quot; Mark commented, &quot;I&#39;ve heard rumors of a human running around Fee City... but we&#39;ve all been Kats for so long that it&#39;s seemed something of a &quot;myth&quot; if you catch my meaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can take you to where we found him,&quot; Midnight offered, &quot;You&#39;ll see that he smells human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think he could leave Fee City?&quot; Mark asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; Talia admitted, &quot;He might, since being human in a city full of Kats would make him stick out like a sore thumb, but the fact that he is here would mean that someone had to have seen or smelled him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded in agreement, &quot;I agree... If he was camping here...you may want to check our Walmart or similar stores. You might someone who has seen or smelled this human... and if he has any pattern, he&#39;ll likely return there at some point... you&#39;d also want to check our restaurants... McDonnalds or Burger King or some other fast food restaurant as they&#39;ll be cheaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were hopping you might be able to help us catch him,&quot; Midnight spoke.<br />
<br />
Mark gave a sigh, &quot;We can, but remember that&#39;s all dependent on him remaining in Fee City. If he truly is out to be trouble... he might leave Fee City if he thinks you&#39;re after him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really don&#39;t know if he does know or suspect that,&quot; Talia answered, &quot;and if he does leave we&#39;ll try and get an APB on him with around the country and go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully though, he stays here and we can catch him,&quot; Midnight spoke up, &quot;Maurice recently gave birth in Janace... and regardless of whether or not you think shi and Snowy were wrong for the way they did what they did, you can&#39;t really hate them as people... and shi does seek redemption for the wrongs of committed in the Fee City outbreak... and well, learning that hir brother had been spying on hir and is probably responsible for allowing Li Sang to try and use the outbreaks to commit robberies... the shock and stress is probably want sent hir into labor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s eyes widened, and Talia watched as shi then looked down to hir taur half.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is shi...?&quot; Mark asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what we got over the phone... shi gave birth to twins and is doing fine,&quot; Talia answered, &quot;but we still need to catch hir brother. Ending Li Sang&#39;s games by destroying his organization depends on it.&quot;</p>
