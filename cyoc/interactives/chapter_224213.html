<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The air outside was nice and cool, not too chilly, as some Autumn nights could be. There were people out here, mostly standing in line for the bar. To distract himself, he started rating costumes. After all, there was a vote coming up in a few hours for best character.<br />
<br />
There was a guy wearing a boar mask and dressed up like a Frenchman, a bottle of Bordeux in hand. <br />
<br />
It took him a moment. Ah, *Boar*deux, well played. Not really a character, though, more of a pun. Not inventive. Especially if he was a french stereotype who loved wine. Loved that big behind, though. Nice and round, it jiggled cutely whenever the portly porker walked around.<br />
<br />
A brawny man wearing a bull half-mask and a nose ring was walking around in a loincloth. <br />
<br />
The half-mask was really well done, too. Why, it practically merged seamlessly with the man’s lower face! He must have been wearing prosthetics too, because his nose and mouth bulged unnaturally. The weirdest part was that the guy was wearing a muscle suit. Judging by the obvious swell of muscles that lay beneath it, he didn’t need to wear one.<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Billy said, shaking his head. “Guess guys’ll do anything for bigger muscles sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“You’re one to talk.” A voice spoke from nearby.<br />
<br />
Billy turned in time to get a cloud of marijuana smoke blown in his face. His nostrils wrinkled as the skunky smell hit them. He rubbed his muzzle and gave a rather realistic snort, trying to clear the smell out.<br />
<br />
He waved his hand, clearing the smoke and revealing a young, well-built jock wearing a bear mask.<br />
<br />
The jock’s body was peak physical perfection. His shoulders were broad, waist, then, his bulging pecs straining to escape his white t-shirt. Tufts of brown body hair curled from the neck collar. A mop of dishwater blonde hair was tucked haphazardly beneath a backwards-facing baseball cap. The varsity jock he wore strained at its seams, his jeans were loose except around his well-rounded posterior. <br />
<br />
His mouth was sporting a joint and a smirk, his expression landing somewhere between playful and mischievous. Billy couldn’t really see his face behind the furry half-mask, but he could see his green eyes, and he had a strong jaw. <br />
<br />
God, ripped and handsome. Some guys have all the luck. Still, it didn’t excuse being rude and blowing smoke in Billy’s face.<br />
<br />
“Baah~! What was that for?” Billy demanded, glaring at the bear-masked jock.<br />
<br />
“Just giving you a dose of second-hand chill. Pull up a seat.“ The bear-masked jock patted the stone bench next to him. “I’m Bradley Baer, by the way.”<br />
<br />
Billy sat down next to the jock, feeling more than a little intimidated. Clearly, he was not wearing a muscle suit. That body was real and clearly honed to perfection and fuck, was this guy *hot*!<br />
<br />
“You’re drooling,” The guy relaxed, shooting Billy a lazy smile.<br />
<br />
Billy wiped his lip, realizing he was drooling.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Man, this party is so fun. I hadn’t meant it literally.” Bradley chortled. “What’s your name, sir?”<br />
<br />
“B-Billy,” Billy stammered, unable to take his eyes off the jock’s broad chest and that tuft of hair. Fuck, he wanted to bury his head in between those mounds of meat. “Uh, Billy Gruff.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, love the outfit. You supposed to be a well-hung nerd or something?” Bradley asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh… well…” Billy licked his lips. “I’m actually a jock.”<br />
<br />
“With that body?”<br />
<br />
“No muscle suits left in the closet.” Billy bit his lip. <br />
<br />
“Oh, guess we’ll have to do this the natural way then.” Bradley scratched his head, his ears flicking. <br />
<br />
Billy’s eyes centered on the bear’s ears. They moved almost naturally. How the hell had he rigged them to do that.<br />
<br />
“Man, you rich guys always have the coolest costumes.” Billy blurted. “And you’re handsome, too.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks?” Bradley cocked his head. “I think.” <br />
<br />
Billy blushed but nodded. “I wanna be the type of guy you’re into.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, you don’t know what kinda guy I’m into.” Bradley’s small smile widened, gazing up at Billy, a speculative look in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Can I guess?”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” Bradeley shrugged and took another drag.<br />
<br />
Billy nodded and said. “I bet you’re the kinda guy who likes other guys. I know you like guys because you accosted me and made that ‘hung’ comment, which a straight guy would never even acknowledge.”<br />
<br />
“Go on.”<br />
<br />
“And you admire muscles and the male form. Hence your perfectly crafted bod. But you also like ruggedness, untamed masculinity, since you don’t cut your hair and you let that thick tuft of fur poke out of your collar. Most bodybuilders shave themselves to better show off their muscles. That you didn’t, means you find that kind of thing hot.”<br />
<br />
Bradley was smirking now.<br />
<br />
“Anything else.<br />
<br />
“Not unless I get to know you,” Billy admitted, then looked up at Bradley, “And I really want to get to know you.”<br />
<br />
Bradley nodded. “Heh, maybe you can be my type after all.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just not sure how you’ll do that.” Billy shrugged. “Look at me. You’d need magic, and magic isn’t real.”<br />
<br />
“Magic isn’t-?” Bradley glanced up, confused for a moment, then a lazy smile crossed his features.<br />
<br />
It was a look that set Billy’s heart aflutter. Bradley was so, like, relaxed and handsome and kinda lazy…<br />
<br />
“First timer, eh?” Bradley said, nodding to himself. “Makes sense, makes sense. Don’t worry, Billy. I can help you. Rich, attractive, muscular… and my type, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but what could you-” Billy started to ask, confused.<br />
<br />
“Hush. Just do what I say, okay?” Bradley said.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Just… let me tell you about yourself and you can just agree to it.” Bradley said, taking another drag from his blunt. “Okay, got my creative juices flowing. So. You’re a jock?”<br />
<br />
“...Yes.” Bradley nodded, then pulled down his pants, showing off the elastic band of his jock. “Look, I’m even wearing one!”<br />
<br />
“He, kinky. Good prop, too.” Bradley said appreciatively, then his eyes lit up. “Oooh!  Hold on, let me phrase this… uh…”<br />
<br />
Billy waited with baited breath.<br />
<br />
“... Man, I know that’s your lucky jock and all, but did ya have to wear it to the masquerade?” Bradley smirked.<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
“Especially since you rarely wash it. It’s so musky, I can smell it from here.” Bradley licked his lips.<br />
<br />
“Bro, what are you-” Billy started to say, when a ripe scent hit his nose.<br />
<br />
Billy sniffed again and realized it was coming from his own crotch. <br />
<br />
The smell was musky yet almost… inviting, evoking a pang of nostalgia and a flood of memories. <br />
<br />
It was the kind of odor big, over-productive balls might have after training for hours on the field beneath a hot sun. Beneath that was the scent of a randy goat’s excitement from tackling other guys, pinning them against the turf, it was game night, and the flood lights shown down on him as he held the other man for a little too long.<br />
<br />
Billy shook his head in confusion. He turned to Bradley and saw the nostrils on his mask wriggle in a lifelike manner as the bear leaned forward for a better sniff of Billy’s musk.God, the sexy quarterback was so hot.<br />
<br />
He spread his legs and leaned back invitingly before wondering why he was doing that. <br />
<br />
And when had Bradley’s mask look so realistic? His gaze traveled down to the bear-masked man’s chest, which looked even larger, the single tuft of fur creeping up his neck and joining with his beard.<br />
<br />
Billy himself was feeling odd, his muscles warm and swelling.<br />
<br />
When he looked down, his fluffy goatee met his own burgeoning chest fur. His whole body looked much harder, like he hit the gym regularly. Billy’s clothing still fit perfectly somehow, though he knew that with such big muscles they should be tearing at the seams.<br />
<br />
The growing heat in his muscles caused sweat to make the fur clump together. <br />
<br />
“W-what the baah~?” Billy groaned.<br />
<br />
“Here, bro, take a hit of this.” Bradley grinned, passing his blunt to Billy.<br />
<br />
Billy took the joint with a numb hand and stared at the sharp teeth that now lined Bradley’s protruding snout. He flexed his fingers, then glanced down to see his fingernails had enveloped his fingertips.<br />
<br />
Fuck, he was so not ready to deal with this sober. Billy took a drag, then coughed explosively as the noxious smoked burned his lungs.<br />
<br />
“Heh, it ain’t like a cigarette, man. It’s harsh. Gotta hold it in.” Bradley advised, then paused, a sly smile creeping across his muzzle. “But I don’t have to tell you that, eh Billy? You’ve been smoking weed for years.”<br />
<br />
Billy frowned but took another drag. His lungs spasmed, wanted to ejaculate the smoke… but then they calmed. He casually blew the smoke out in rings. A wave of relaxation hit him and he sagged against Bradley’s broad shoulder.<br />
<br />
His head was becoming top-heavy anyways. He reached up and felt his horns growing longer, heavier, more pronounced. That, like, so shouldn’t be possible, but Bradley wasn’t freakin’ over it, so he just went with the flow, a happy smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Man, that’s some good shit…” Billy shook his head. “You would not believe-”<br />
<br />
“I think I can.” Bradley smirked. “All those hours we spent at the gym together, all the football practices, the keggers… game nights and after parties… ”<br />
<br />
Bradley groaned as he body swelled even more, growing even sweatier and muskier. His memories shifted to the keggers, the nights out with Bradley and his buds, camping. His body swelled with fat this time, his body growing rather paunchy.<br />
<br />
And then his muscles started to catch up. <br />
<br />
His chest bulged with muscles and shoved itself forward, the first three buttons of his plaid shirt popping off, revealing gray fur beneath and an impressively deep cleavage. His shoulders rounded, the growth traveling down his arms as his biceps grew vascular and big as bowling balls. He shifted on the stone bench as his rump grew round, his slacks tight across his bubbly ass. <br />
<br />
Something… something was happening.<br />
<br />
He stood, then nearly fell over.<br />
<br />
Billy teetered for balance as the arches of his feet raised. He stepped out of his shoes and heard a series of loud *clops*. When he looked down, he saw that his toes had somehow merged into broad cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
“Where ya goin’, man?” Bradley asked, “I thought you wanted to smoke weed with me.”<br />
<br />
Bradley glanced at the brown bear, trying to figure out if the ursine was playing with him. Didn’t he notice Billy grow huge?<br />
<br />
Everything felt off, but Bradley was right. He… he had come out here to smoke weed. Bradley was his best friend and they played football together. That was true…<br />
<br />
“Sit down, man, don’t cause a scene. We’d lose our scholarships if anyone found out we got tossed from this party for smokin’ weed.” Bradley said, his eyes not leaving Billy’s form. “And you know you need a scholarship. Ya didn’t get into Harvard cause of your brains, ya know.”<br />
<br />
“I-” Billy tried to respond, feeling a little insulted, but found himself coming up short. This hot bod of his was the only reason he’d gotten into Harvard. That and his daddy’s money.<br />
<br />
Billy sat back down and Bradley threw and arm around his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Just relax, and maybe after a good smoke sesh I’ll suck that big cock of yours.” Bradley winked.<br />
<br />
Billy blushed, his cock growing hard, tenting the crotch of his slacks. And then, incredibly, it got even harder.<br />
<br />
His shaft pulse and throbbed, and when he reached down to adjust it, he no longer found a fluffy sock padding his groin, but firm, veiny dick flesh that twitched beneath his thick, clumsy fingers. He let out a groan, deep and bassy, as his big balls clenched, sending testosterone coarsing through his body.<br />
<br />
The testosterone seared through his system, causing darker body fur to spring up in wild tangles. <br />
<br />
It was a nice burn, and he rolled his shoulders, groaning as his jaw widened and then pushed out into a muzzle. His brow thickened and beetled, leaving his eyes looking smaller and a bit dumber. His goateee grow longer and more wild, like he never bothered to trim it.<br />
<br />
Where once was a shy, thin nerdy dude, there was now a hulking, brawny stud wearing rumpled, sweat-soaked, poorly fitting clothes. Sure, he had a musclegut going, but that only served to make his muscles puffy and gave his rump a nice bounce whenever he walked.<br />
<br />
“There we go, there’s the big, rugged linebacker I know.” Bradley chuckled, looking over the changes in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Billy shook his head. He felt dimmer, and not just from the weed.<br />
<br />
“I… I stink?” Billy stammered, his voice deep and rumbly. There was something off. His thoughts felt muddled, his mind foggy.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry big guy, I like the smell.” Bradley whispered, placing a wide handpaw on Billy’s muscular thigh, rubbing it slowly.<br />
<br />
Billy blushed, a damp stain forming at the tip of the tent in his pants. “Th-thanks.”<br />
<br />
Bradley took a drag off the joint, then pulled Billy into a kiss, shotgunning the smoke into Billy’s mouth. Their tongues wrestled as Billy closed his eyes, wrapping his arms around the hunky bear and deepening the kiss. Finally, they pulled away, a curl of smoke and saliva trailing from their muzzles.<br />
<br />
“Man, you’re perfect!” Bradley smiled, wiping his mouth off with a big, furry arm. “Being mentally compromised, like getting high or drunk, makes the changes go faster, by the way. Food for thought next time you come to these parties.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? What changes?” Billy asked, scratching his nuts. <br />
<br />
“Never mind, stud.”  Bradley snorted out a laugh as he watched Billy shamelessly scratch his junk and sniff his fingers. “Man, I wish I had a bro like you in the real world… “<br />
<br />
The bear looked oddly somber for a moment.<br />
<br />
Billy didn’t know what the hell Baer was talking about. They hung out together all the time. Hell, he’d sucked his dick last weekend after the big game!<br />
<br />
“Come on, bro.” Billy said, punching Bradley on the shoulder playfully. “Real world, Cool World, Jungle World, Ice World, Tattooine, you always got me. Let’s get you upstairs. Ya got me all horned up.”<br />
<br />
Bradley cackled and stood up, “Ya, yer right, that was a little too much. Must be the weed talking.”<br />
<br />
They got up and walked back around the mansion to the main party.</p>
