<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassie didn't consider herself a vindictive person, but as she sat at her computer watching John lift weights without a care in the world, she found herself growing more and more angry at what he had done to her. &quot;Let's see if this thing works,&quot; she told herself, before adding, &quot;Then we'll see how he likes it on the other side of the fence.&quot; She reached for her keyboard and typed in 'John will stop lifting weights, take off all his clothes and stand in full view of the camera.' She hit the send button and watched, somewhat surprised that it actually worked, as John set the bar up on the rack and got up from the bench press. He stripped off the boxer shorts he was wearing, leaving himself completely in the nude. He walked over to the middle of the room, stretching out a bit there in his full naked glory.<br />
<br />
Cassie was momentarily mesmerized by the sight of his naked body, before the anger within her reminded her of what she was really here to do. Taking one last look at his handsome form, she began to type with vigor into the text box on the site, 'John Tucker will, over the next fives minutes, transform into a high school girl the same age as he is. When the transformation is done, everyone will but me and John think that she is actually John's cousin Josie, staying in town as part of an exchange program. As a result, all of his possessions and ID will change to match his new identity.' She lingered over the send button for a moment longer, trying to justify her actions in her mind, when a rush of hatred made her click it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in John's room, he was still stretching after a rather intesne workout session. He knew he had a hot date tonight and was trying to finish his daily workout regiment before taking a shower and heading out. For some reason he had decided to stretch in the nude that day, an odd thing since he never had done that before. Still, he thought little of it as he finished stretching and prepared to head to his bathroom to take a shower.<br />
<br />
A cold wind suddenly burst through the room, seemingly from nowhere, causing the hair on John's arms and the back of his neck to stand at attention. A shiver ran down his spine as he looked around, trying to see where the wind had come from. As he did, he felt a tingling sensation run up and down the whole of his body. He looked down over himself, somewhat scared at this feeling that had suddenly overcome him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on,&quot; he asked to no one, feeling his chest and abdomen area. He didn't notice anything wrong with himself, other than this omnipresent tingling that coursed through his body. As he removed his hands from his chest though, he looked down and freaked at what he saw. The slim amount of chest hair he had been growing had just fallen off as if it were washed away by water. Looking down at his arms and legs, he found that the hair there had succumbed to a similar fate. Where once hair had been, their now only rested smooth, soft skin. &quot;The hell!&quot; he screamed, frightened by what he had just seen. He looked around the room frantically, trying to see if there was some force there he wasn't aware of. &quot;This isn't fUUUUnny!&quot; He screeched out, his voice cracking midsentence. Instantly his hands reached for his throat. His voice just sounded like it did when he was a kid. It hadn't cracked like that in four or five years. &quot;This cAAAn't be hapenIIIng.&quot; he squealed out again, his breathing becoming more panicked by the moment. Suddenly, he felt the Adam's Apple in his throat literally melt away to nothing, as his neck slowly shrank in size. &quot;This is in...EEEP!&quot; His hands left his throat in a moment as his voice was suddenly not his own. In it's place was a high lilt of a woman's voice. Slowly he removed his hands, and spoke out softly, &quot;Hello?&quot; Startled, his hands clamped down on his mouth again. As they did, he caught sight of them in the corner of his eyes.<br />
<br />
Shocked, he placed his hands in front of his eyes. In mere moments, he watched in horror as they slimmed down to more feminine proportions. What's worse, he watched as his nails slowly grew out, tapering off nearly a full inch from the ends of his slender fingers. Quickly, he turned back to the mirror that hung in his room, and barely stopped himself from letting out a high pitched scream. He watched as the muscles he had worked long and hard to get slowly melted into his body, replaced with smooth skin and finely toned muscles barely below the surface. His shoulders shrank inwards, losing their broad width. Finally, to his horror, he saw himself shrink in the mirror, losing at least five inches of height in a matter of moments. One thing that didn't seem to shrink though were his legs, as they curved outward slightly and seemed to lengthen, although it might have only been an illusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't real,&quot; he told himself, ignoring the fully female voice he now possessed. A burning sensation enveloped his face, and he was forced to look away from the mirror. Holding his face in some vain attempt to chase away the pain, he felt sickened as his flesh molded and reshaped itself beneath his new fingers. When the pain ceased, he hesitantly looked into the mirror, and gasped at what he saw. His face had transformed into a visage of feminine grace and beauty. There were signs of what he used to look like, but they were hard to point out unless you knew what you were looking for. So mesmorized by his new face was he, that he almost missed his ears folding inward at a slight angle. What he didn't miss though was the brown hair slowly snake its way back off the top of his head, stopping just past his narrowed shoulders. Shaking his head with tears threatening to leak out of his enlarged, almond-shaped eyes, John grabbed a handful of silky hair and looked at it, trying to will it to go away.<br />
<br />
He doubled over in slight pain as his waist suddenly contracted inward, accentuating his hips and giving him the beginnings of an hourglass figure. More pain coursed through his body, and he heard a sickening snap as his hips widened, bone cracking and reshaping in mere moments, one right after the other. He slowly lowered his hands and felt around his new curves. If these had been on any girl, he would have been happy to check them out. On him though, they felt alien and revolting. As he looked, he watched in alarm as fat began to build up on his backside, causing his ass to grow to a perfect feminine heartshape.<br />
<br />
A buzzing sensation in his chest clued him into the next obvious changes, and his hands rushed up to his nipples, trying to contain the inevitable. He pressed hard against his chest, recoiling in pain at his now larger and more sensitive nipples in the process. He watched as they grew to be the size of a quarter, expanding larger and more prominent than they ever had. Then, irrevocably altering his identity, he watched in both fascination and horror as the flesh around them began to build upon itself, as round globes slowly pushed outwards. He frantically tried to push them back in, but to no avail, as within a few moments he had his own set of perky, full, and large female breasts. It was hard to gauge a cup size, but a small part of his male mind that was turned on by the sight of any female breasts chimed in that they were probably at least a D-cup. Whatever size they were, they were far too large on his frame.<br />
<br />
As he took stock of his situation, he realized there was something still left of his male body. With fear in his eyes he looked down at his proud member, standing erect in defiance at the bombshell of a girl he was slowly transforming into. Eventually though, John started to cry as he watched his pubic hair slowly shrink back, becoming a thinner, triangle pattern. His tears were soon replaced by a warm feeling in the bottom of his belly. He couldn't believe that he was actually feeling pleasure from this, but the warmth radiating outwards felt too much like bliss not to be. Instinctively, his hand went to his chest and began to tweak at his nipple. He let out a soft moan as he watched, with equal parts horror, pleasure, and sadness as his testicles were slurped up inside of him one by one. His scrotum began to shrink, along with the shaft of his cock, growing smaller and smaller. His other hand reached down, at first in vain to try and stop himself from losing the last thing that made him, well, a him. But all too soon his hand was acting out of pleasurable instinct, rubbing and pulling at the shrinking head of his penis as it completed its transformation into a female clitoris. His moans became more guttural and frantic in nature, as his hips began to involuntarily buck up and down. As his ministrations became more intense, he saw his scrotal sack split into a pair of vaginal lips and his new clitoris settle itself above the opening to his new hole. He tentatively placed one finger inside of himself, an alien sensation to be sure, but all too soon he was dripping from his new vagina, and in a few moments, he was welcomed fully into womanhood with a mindblowing orgasm.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the floor, trying frantically to catch her breath, John tried in vain to come up with an idea as to what had happened. She could only contemplate such things for a moment before she looked up, and saw...</p>
