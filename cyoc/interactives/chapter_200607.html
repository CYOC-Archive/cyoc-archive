<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Confused by the unusual response from her sister, Emily paused and looked back at Jen. Then she realized the gist of it all. &quot;Oh shit, are you saying that the curse thing did this to you? Who the hell cursed you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That bastard Kyle. Anyways, please don&#39;t tell anyone&quot; begged Jen. But Emily wouldn&#39;t listen and shook her head. &quot;No, this is going way too far for a return prank. And while I do have to say that you did deserve something in return, this is not ok. I&#39;m going to tell mom.&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily was about to leave the room when Jen remembered she had cursed Emily about 1 minute ago. &quot;Stop!&quot; She Shouted.<br />
<br />
Emily froze, allowing Jen to continue uninterrupted. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Emily, but I have to do this. For your dare, you cannot disobey me outside of things that are a risk to people&#39;s lives.  And for your transformation, um... well I kinda need to keep an eye on you now, so I guess your legs will disappear and your waist will um... merge with my shoulders and the back of my head? I will still be in control of our legs, while you can keep your arms and whatnot. Oh, and your digestive system will hook into mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s legs vanished, dropping the girl onto the floor suddenly. She then also vanished and reappeared on Jen&#39;s neck and upper back. Their skin began to merge as their internal structures joined together, creating a human centaur with 2 heads (though one is located in the other&#39;s former crotch) and high heeled feet. Jen could feel herself lose her connection to her stomach, as Emily&#39;s organs took over for her digestive needs. She retained her ability to speak though, and breathing became optional for her as they now had two set of lungs to work with.<br />
<br />
Jen noticed that her tongue felt weird, and her nose was particularly sensitive now. Her mouth also began to taste differently too. She felt her mouth alter it&#39;s internal shape, as her jaw bone softened along with her teeth. She still had them, but they were purely for anesthetics now, and served practically no functionality outside of speaking. <br />
<br />
What was further weird, was that the inside of her mouth was more vertically aligned now somehow. And slowly but surely, Jen watched as her nose sank back into her face, while her mouth rotated it&#39;s alignment 90 degrees, becoming a vertical slit. Her lips plumped up though, and her former nose blended into the upper corner of her mouth. Her swollen lips became extremely sensitive as well, and lost their redish coloration.<br />
<br />
Emily bent down to look at her sister, but stopped upon seeing her face. &quot;God Jen, why the fuck did you do this? Now we are stuck together!&quot; Complained Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but in case you havent noticed, I am having kind of a rough morning here, so I panicked, alright? You were going to go tell Mom about this and then she would get involved and then it would look like I went crying to my mommy because of a retaliation to a prank I pulled, which she also doesn&#39;t need to know about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But now I&#39;m wrapped up in all of this bullshit too!&quot; Exclaimed Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re smart girls, so we should be able to figure a way out of this.&quot; Optimisticly stated Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, one of us is at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey nothing. I&#39;m not the one who turned my own face into my younger sister&#39;s pussy because I panicked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen wanted to refute that, but couldn&#39;t think of a way how, as it was the truth. Emily, happy with her victory, reached down and stuck 2 fingers into Jen&#39;s mouth and tugged her &quot;cheek&quot; to the left. Jen gasped and both girls felt their legs become shaky for a moment. Jen stuck her tongue out, and they realized that it was covered in small ridges and folds, like the inside of a pussy has. Jen&#39;s saliva was thicker, and gooey too, as it was now her sister&#39;s grool. Jen fully realized the extent of her change, and now understood the weird taste in her mouth. Her mouth had become Emily&#39;s pussy, while partially keeping her month&#39;s functionality.<br />
<br />
Jen also realized that she was hearing through her sister&#39;s ears now, as her own had been absorbed into Emily&#39;s lower body along with her head. She also couldn&#39;t move her head, and was forced to look straight ahead, or slightly in the direction wher Emily turned her upper body to look. <br />
<br />
In the root of her mind, Jen suddenly felt a strong desire to walk forwards. &quot;Well, we are not fixing us here, so let me at least go get dressed first Jen.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s convenient.&quot; Said Jen once Emily removed her fingers from her swolen labia.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you want me to move, I can tell without you saying anything. But it still is ultimately my decision if and how I will or not.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then move us into my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok ok, I&#39;m going now.&quot; Jen took a cautious step forwards with her front left leg, then another leg, and after a few steps, managed to make it out of her bedroom. The clacking of her feet echoed throughout the house. But thankfully, Jen was a huge fan of high heels to begin with and wore them almost daily, so the sound didn&#39;t draw their mother&#39;s suspicion.<br />
<br />
It was an awkward start, but Jen quickly got the hang of walking on her 4 high heeled legs.  Enough at least to now walk without the slow start up. Emily put on a crop top so that she didn&#39;t block Jen&#39;s eyes. But doing so emphasized her large boobs a lot more. She may be a yeah younger than her sister, but Emily was similarly stacked like her sister. Both of them were of the rare &quot;thin, yet busty&quot; body type. And Emily&#39;s DD were the result of it. Jen&#39;s F cups were larger still, but now hung below their body like a pair of udders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking right now, and while your not wrong, I still don&#39;t think we should jump to calling them udders.&quot; Said Jen, knowing exactly what Emiky was thinking from the look in her eye that she saw reflected in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;But, they sorta are udders now. They are like horse udders, only positioned behind our forelegs and not between our hindlegs. Plus they&#39;re huge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, feeling a bit proud of being recognized for her bountiful boobage, was relatively quickly convinced by Emily. Jen was weak to flattery, and Emily knew how to exploit it to get her way. Plus she knew that Jen wouldn&#39;t force her way as she would hate doing it to her without a really good reason to.<br />
<br />
Emily tried to reach, but couldn’t fit a pair of panties over Jen&#39;s ass, so they had to give up. Even jen&#39;s didn&#39;t fit around her new, fuller ass. What Emily did do though, is take one of her sister&#39;s sex toys from her stash in the closet, and ram it up her ass after luring it up. Jen jumped upon the sudden and unexpected anal insertion. Emily secured it in place and was proud of her work. <br />
<br />
She had just plugged Jen&#39;s ass with the best &quot;horse tail&quot; butt plug that Jen owned. It had the fullest tail, and was the prettiest as well. It also was a &quot;smart tail&quot; and wirelessly connected to a special patch that Emily stuck to her scalp and covered with her hair. The patch would read her brain waves and would move the tail accordingly. She also put on the horse ear headband that connected to the same patch, and hid her ears beneath her hair too. <br />
<br />
&quot;You do have some of the best toys sis. You really should go out with them on/in you more often.&quot; Commented Emily while admiring herself in the mirror. &quot;Alright. Now then, let&#39;s go fix this.&quot;</p>
