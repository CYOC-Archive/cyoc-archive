<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill looked down at the very large wet spot on his bed and his heart sank. He hadnt done that four three years now, and now at the age of eighteen he had again.
<br>
 Bill took off his soaked boxer briefs and threw them across his room in anger and dispair! Was he going to have to worry about this shit happening every nite
<br>
 again? Bill shook his head in discust and grabed the towel he had diposited on the floor from yesterdays shower and headed out for the bathroom he had to get
<br>
 ready for school so he just threw a bunch of dirty jeans and clothes on his bed to cover the very noticable wet area up, and headed for the bathroom. 
<br>

<br>
 Bill got there and staired into the mirror, he looked like he thought he should so he started the shower and jumped in when the water was warm enough for him. Bill
<br>
 washed up and and then lathered up his cock, it imeideatly sprun to life and to a full erection! Bill was surprized about this but took advantage of it anyway! He
<br>
 strocked it wildly for what seemed like forever! But he never seemed to climax not even pre cum came from his throbbing member. Whats wrong here he thought
<br>
 as he continued to be arosed but not climaxing at all! Bill finally stoped his strocking and gave up! He was obviously to preoccupied by the nightmare to get off at
<br>
 all. Bill finally got out after the water began to get to cold, he apperently been in there for along time! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill grabed a towel and headed for the mirror, his dick was still very erect and it seemed like it would never go down. Bill decided that he would just ignore it and it
<br>
 would eventually go flacid again, it was just mourning wood thats all he told himself as he dryed off and then dryed the fog off the mirror so he could see himself.
<br>
 He looked the way he thought he should have but the counter seemed to be higher to him? Naa he thought Im just imagining things its always been this high! Bill
<br>
 finished drying off, and then began to dry his hair. Nuch to his own dismay though the towel was full of his hair! To much of his hair he thought! He looked back at
<br>
 his reflection and noticed that his forhead seemed to be just abit to long? And the hair under his long bangs seemed to be receiding abit as well! Bill grabbed the
<br>
 hand mirror out of the sinks drawer and put it to the back of his head to see if he was indeed loosing his hair, HE WAS! He had a small but obvious balding area
<br>
 right where his normally thick hair spiraled out in a circular pattern and the middle area was positivly empty of hair! About a half dollars size bald area dooned the
<br>
 very back of his head! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill remembered the dream and started to freak out in the dream he was a skinny short bald guy! And dumb as hell as well! &quot;OH GOD ITS HAPPENING!&quot; Bill
<br>
 practically yelled, he threw his hand to his mouth to stop from being heard and tears started to form in his bright blue eyes, Bill wiped his eyes and then his runny
<br>
 nose! POUND POUND POUND! Someone one wanted in the bathroom! Then he heard who it was it was his younger brother Kevin! &quot;HURRY UP MAN! I
<br>
 GOTTA TAKE A PISS ASSHOLE! Kevin screamed! Bill combed his hair and then took another look at the back of his head, the bald spot seemed to be
<br>
 covered up! Maybe he was just paranoid or something? Bill dismissed his mind of the thoughts of him going bald as nothing and went to the door with a towel
<br>
 tightly wraped around his waist. 
<br>

<br>
 Bill waited for his younger brother to pound again, and giggled when he did. He sounded desperate now and Bill loved to fuck with his little brother! He picked on
<br>
 him constantly, and this was no exeption! &quot; HOLD YOUR HORSES YA LITTLE SHIT!&quot; Bill said knowing that kevin was probably ready to piss his pants by
<br>
 now. Bill waited for Kevin to pound at the door one more time! This ttime it was a real loud pound! Kevin wasent going to be able to hold it much longer and Bill
<br>
 knew it. He purposly waited for the next pounding and then positioned himself in the door way so that when Kevin opened it he could hold His 5'7&quot; 140Lb brother
<br>
 in his tracks till the poor kid pissed his pants right where he held him! It was a cruel joke but not benieth Bill to do it to the smaller guy! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill swung the door open and imiedeatly threw his hands on his desperate brothers shoulders and stoped him where he was! Kevin was holding the crotch of his
<br>
 jeans in an attempt to stop the inevitable from happening! Bill was abit taken back though, as he held him there! It seemed that his shorter brther had hit a growth
<br>
 spurt that he hadent noticed till then! They were now almost eye to eye! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill was still bigger then his brother though and dispite his struggling he was able to hold him where he was till his poor brother began to loose it right there in the
<br>
 hall! Bill laughed as a wet spot formed on the front of his 15 year old brothers jeans and piss spurted out between his clutched fingers! The spot spread rapidly on
<br>
 the front of his jeans and then down his legs to his knees! Kevin was howling at the top of his lungs and Bill knew that his parents would hear him soon so Bill let go
<br>
 of Kevin and let him in the bathroom. Bill laughed as Kevin slambed the door and lock it! Bill just smiled and started for his room thinking that that was one way to
<br>
 get his slob of a brother to take a shower for once! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill stoped at the closet to grab some sheets to change his bed after he fliped the mattress and then he would hide the wet sheets and wash them when he could.
<br>
 But as Bill approched his room he saw that his door was wide open! He knew he had shut it! Bills heart raced! Had his brother been in his room again? Did he see
<br>
 that he had wet the bed? Fear now rocked the jocks brain as he hurryed his pace to hide the evidence from his folks! But as he entered his room he saw his Mom
<br>
 and Dad were already flipping his mattress for him! And to his great disbeliefe they were putting on the old plastic protective sheet he had to have on his bed when
<br>
 he was a bed wetter at the age of 13! His heart sank as he watched them! He didnt know what to say or what to do? 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Mom I dont need that sheet really! PLEASE MOM!&quot; Bill said as they finished putting it on his bed. &quot;Now Billy you know its just a precaution son! We cant have
<br>
 you wetting the mattress and ruining it honey.&quot; Bills mother Kay said with a smile. Bill was red faced and humiliated by the way she said it! And she just called him
<br>
 Billy and not Bill! His Dad Tom was glaring at him with that look of just do as your told or else look! Bill didnt say anything more as the two finished putting two
<br>
 more sheets on his bed, they then told him to get dressed and come down stairs and they would talk about this somemore over breakfast! Bill was mortified by that
<br>
 statement! Now his younger brother would know he wet his bed too! &quot;NO MOM DON&quot;T TELL KEVIN ABOUT THIS! PLEASE!&quot; Bill pleaded. &quot;Alright Billy
<br>
 it'll be our secret honey.&quot; Kay said as she and Tom left Bills room. Billy started to just cry! He couldnt stop himself! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill knew he had to get ready for school so he went to his drawers and grabed out some clothes a pair of jeans and a tee shirt and his favorites a pair of boxer
<br>
 briefs. Bill gput on the boxers and they were to loose on him they no longer hugged his thighs the way they were supposd to? Bill dismissed this as just them being
<br>
 streached out. He then tryed his favorite jeans and found them to be to loose as well something was defenetly wrong with every thing now!</p>
