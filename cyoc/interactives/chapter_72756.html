<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure, if you can pay for it,&quot; the shopkeeper said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's say... a hundred and sixty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Ethan said, getting his debit card from his wallet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? How does a kid like you have a hundred and sixty dollars to spend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dad's rich,&quot; Ethan lied, performing the debit transaction.<br />
<br />
Truth was he'd recently inherited a rather large fortune from his grandmother a couple weeks ago, enough that he probably didn't technically need to work again for the rest of his life, but he did anyways so that he had something to do during the day. But he was on vacation at the moment and he didn't want to think about work.<br />
<br />
The shopkeeper grabbed the book from its spot in the window and handed it to him. &quot;Thanks dude,&quot; Ethan replied and carried the book with him out the shop, and made his way towards home.<br />
<br />
As he left he vaguely noticed a boy of about sixteen enter the shop, he was dressed in all black, including a sort of trench coat and was clearly a goth. It sounded like he was angry over something when he addressed the shopkeeper, but Ethan was too far out of earshot and shortly after was out the door. From there he just had to make his way towards home.<br />
<br />
When he did get home the first thing he did was put his clothes in his drawers, though some of them he just left on the floor, and meanwhile he stuffed his old adult clothes in the closet. &quot;Guess I really am getting into this being a kid thing,&quot; Ethan muttered, seeing the mess he was quickly making of his room.<br />
<br />
At last he turned his attention to the book. The cover read 'Book of Body' and when he opened it he saw the list of spells:<br />
<br />
I. Muscle Growth<br />
This spell allows one to grant strength and muscles to himself or others to make one stronger, faster, more agile, etc. While how much muscle they wish to give one is up to the caster, it should be warned that making muscles to large can have undesirable consequences. To activate the spell, decide how muscular you want them to be and point at the target. If no target is selected you are the target of the spell. The command word for this spell is ‘muscle’ and the spell consumes only a minor amount of energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
II. Muscle Deflation<br />
This spell allows you to take away the muscles and strength someone already has. It’s good for if you pick a fight with someone twice your size. The command word is ‘deflation’ and to activate the spell picture how muscular you want them to not be and point at your target. If no target is pointed to, you will be the target of the spell. This spell requires only a minor amount of energy to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
III. Growth<br />
This spell allows you to increase one’s size. The size you increase one to has no limits, but the spell will require more energy for more extreme changes. The command word is ‘growth’ and to activate the spell speak the command word, and focus on how large you want the target to be while pointing at the target. If no target is selected, then the spell will affect the caster only. This spell requires a mild amount of energy to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
IV. Shrink<br />
This spell allows you to decrease one’s size. The size you decrease one to has no limits, but the spell will require more energy for more extreme changes. The command word is ‘shrink’ and to activate the spell speak the command word, and focus on how small you want the target, while pointing at the target. If no target is selected, the spell will affect only the caster. This spell requires a mild amount of energy to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
V. Weight Loss<br />
This spell allows you to cause one to loose weight without affecting their size. As a result, you can make someone who looks quite heavy and muscular light as a feather with this spell. The spell’s command word is ‘loss’ and it requires only a mild amount of energy. To activate the spell, speak the command word, and point at the target, while thinking of the new weight. If no target is selected, you become the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
VI. Weight Gain<br />
This spell is the opposite of weight loss. With this one you can make a target weight more without affecting their size. As a result, you can make someone who looks short and light weigh several tons. The spell’s command word is ‘gain’ and it requires only a mild amount of energy. To activate the spell, speak the command word, point and the target, and think of the new weight. If no target is selected, you become the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
VII. Gender Swap<br />
This spell has the ability to change the gender of someone. You can change males into females, and females into males. The spell’s command word is ‘gender’ and requires little energy. To cast the spell, simply point at the target, and say the command word. If you do not point at a target, you will be the target of the spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
VIII. Shape Body<br />
This spell allows you to shape your own or another’s body. You can make them fatter, thinner, taller, shorter, stout, lanky. It can be used in combination with other spells to add visual effect if there is none, but it is mostly used for minor changes that the other spells are not needed for. The spell’s command word is ‘body’ and little energy is required to cast it. Simply point at the target, speak the command word, and picture how you want to shape the body. If no target is selected, you become the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
IX. Body Alteration<br />
This spell is to used to make a body look drastically different. You can change the color of one’s skin, change how much hair they have, their eyes, give them a horn or horns, tails (though it will always come out monkey like with this spell) , and many things that do and do not belong on a human body. However, it is important to note, that if you use this spell to give someone wings or something similar that they will not be able to fly or gain other supernatural abilities. This spell makes cosmetic changes, it doesn’t alter reality. Though, giving someone claws or a horn could probably still cut someone pretty badly. The spell requires a large amount of energy to cast. The command word is ‘alteration’ and you cast it by speaking the command word, pointing at your target, and picturing the changes you want. A warning, this spell can be used to turn someone into say a huge ball of flesh, and not be lethal. However, being turned into, say a huge ball of flesh, is likely to drive some people insane and make them wish they were dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
X. Body Swap<br />
This spell is quite simple. It allows the caster to either switch bodies with someone, or to make two others switch body. Because of the complication of the two targets being in different areas the spell is a bit different to cast. Instead of pointing at the target, the caster must have a piece of their body, hair, nail clippings, or something to represent them. If the caster only has them from one person, when casting the spell he or she will switch bodies with that person. If the caster has pieces of two individuals then he or she can make those individuals swap bodies. The spell requires a large amount of energy, and the command word is ‘swap’.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this could be fun, it'd be nice to get a little bit more muscle,&quot; Ethan said to himself, pulling the Book of Time out of his pocket and watching it return to full size. &quot;Two books, I wonder if they have any effect on each other.&quot;</p>
