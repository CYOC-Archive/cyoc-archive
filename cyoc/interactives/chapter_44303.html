<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan opened his door, and Aaron followed him in, spinning Dan around as soon as the door was closed and giving him a long deep kiss that left Dan a little breathless by the end of it. Dan reached down and felt Aaron’s rock hard cock snaking down the pants of his jeans almost to his knee.<br />
“Well someone’s a little bit eager,” Aaron said, and gave him another kiss, and then looked around the room, where the Chronivac caught his eye. “Holy shit! Is that what I think it is?” he yelled, and rushed over to Dan’s desk, picking it up and looking at it.<br />
“Hey, leave that alone!” Dan tried to push his way between Aaron and the device, but Aaron far outmatched him in size and strength.<br />
Aaron turned it around in his hands, and then pushed Dan’s mouse a little, revealing the Chronivac program Dan had left up. “Holy fuck! It is! I mean, I’d heard rumors in my computer science courses, but I didn’t think they were actually in production…”<br />
“Back off! It’s mine!” Dan yelled, still trying to muscle his way in and block Aaron from his computer, but Aaron put the device down and simply pushed Dan out of his room.<br />
“I think I need a minute or two alone in here. Why don’t you be good and wait outside for a minute or two?” He pushed Dan out, and closed the door behind him.<br />
Dan tried the door handle, but all of the room doors could only be opened from the inside, or with a key, and he had left his key ring on the desk! He banged on the door, “Hey, come on man! Let me in!”<br />
He backed up and looked up and down the hallway for something he could use to get in, but there wasn’t anything, and a moment later, the door opened, and suddenly, the only thing Dan could do was stare at the man in front of him.<br />
Aaron hadn’t changed, but Dan took notice of every little detail he hadn’t noticed before. The tight curve of his biceps, the tuft of chest chair poking out above his neck line, the firm bulge of his gut. Dan loved everything, no more than loved it. It was absolutely perfect.<br />
“Well I guess that worked. Get your ass in here.”<br />
Before he even realized he was moving, Dan was through the door, and mere inches away from the man that was everything he had ever wanted. Before the door was even closed, Dan had fallen to his knees and had buried his face in Aaron’s package, loving the smell of his musk.<br />
“Like that don’t you?”<br />
“Oh yeah…” Dan moaned.<br />
“That would be 'yes Sir.'”<br />
“Yes Sir, I love it Sir.”<br />
“I thought you would,” Aaron said and sat down at the desk, hauling out his semi hard, foot and a half long cock. “Now get under there and suck on this. I have a few changes to make.”<br />
Dan immediately got under the desk and took as much of the dick down his throat as he could, but before he got very far past the head, it hit the back of his throat and he gagged, making him sputter.<br />
“Here let me fix that for you Danny boy,” Aaron said. The Chronivac let out a beep, and the next time Dan took Aaron’s cock in his mouth, it slid all the way down his throat without a hitch.<br />
“Yeah, that’s better,” Aaron said, “Now. You certainly don’t need that foot long cock of yours if you’re going to be my cub, and you’re a bit too hairy for my tastes. A few more pounds wouldn’t hurt either. Yeah, that’s looking better.”<br />
By now, Aaron’s cock was rock hard, and Dan was doing his best to cope with the huge beast in the small confines under the desk. As thick as water bottle, Dan couldn’t fit it in his mouth anymore, so he was just licking up and down the shaft while rubbing the head with both hands, licking up any precum that dribbled out before it could hit the floor. Aaron pushed the chair back, and Dan crawled forward, trying to get back to the cock which was now the focus of all of his attention.<br />
“Hold on now, you’ll get plenty more of that later. Now stand up and strip,” Aaron said, and Dan shucked off all of his clothes. <br />
When he was finished, Aaron reached over and hit the enter button on the keyboard. Immediately Dan started feeling uncomfortably hot all over, and his small tight gut started to expand and soften, forming a good sized apron engulfing his dick and balls, which he could feel tightening and shrinking uncomfortably. What had been decent muscular pecs also ballooned out until they were full, fleshy man-boobs, his nipples doubling in size. His body hair also began pulling itself into his body, leaving him with a light treasure trail, almost no hair on his arms and back, and when he reached up to feel his face, his hard jaw was now soft and round, with a short goatee replacing his once full beard. <br />
“Yeah, take a look at that hot little cub,” Aaron said as he pointed Dan towards the mirror hanging on the wall, “You look downright good enough to fuck.”<br />
Dan was in awe of his image in the mirror, mostly by the sudden thickening of every part of his body. Something he hadn’t noticed was that his head was now completely shaved, “What, but…that’s not…” Dan said, the shock returning a bit of clarity to his mind. <br />
“Shush…” Aaron said, and came up behind him and started grinding his dick between Dan’s ass cheeks, “Don’t worry about it. You look hot, and now that you’re a nice chubby cub, I’m gonna screw your nice fat ass. How does that sound?”<br />
“Sounds great Sir,” Dan moaned, and Aaron pushed him onto the bed faced down, climbed on top of him, and thrust his dick deep into Dan’s ass in one thrust. Dan had been expecting more resistance, but just a smooth, glorious entrance that flooded his vision with stars.<br />
“Yeah, you’re always going to be open for my dick. It’s the only dick you want, isn’t it?”<br />
“Oh yes Sir, it’s…ugh…fucking fantastic.”<br />
“Don’t call me Sir, call me Daddy. I’m your fucking Daddy boy, and your making me so hot I’m gonna blow a hot fucking load all over your guts!” <br />
Aaron sped up his thrust, pulling his dick out and slamming it back into Dan’s hole, making Dan moan with pleasure, and loudly slamming the bed against the wall. With a roar, he buried his cock as deep as it would go and let loose, the feel of his daddy’s dick spasming in his ass making his shoot his own load onto the sheets beneath him. <br />
When both of their orgasms subsided, they collapsed onto the bed, and Aaron whispered into Dan’s ear, “Damn you’re a hot little cub. I think I’m gonna keep you.”<br />
“Oh Daddy, I’m all yours,” Dan moaned, and then passed out on his bed.</p>
