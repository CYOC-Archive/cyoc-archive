<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first you feel the unmistakable sensation of vertigo. Reality as you know it seems to bend. Your body as you know it changes as forces beyond anything you can control violate your body in ways you never thought should (or even could) happen in real life.<br />
<br />
Then, it's over.<br />
<br />
Everything comes into focus and you're in a forested region. It's warm out and you hear birds chirping in the distance. You feel a breeze across your body as the wind blows. When you look down, you see that you're naked! Or, you seem to be naked anyway.<br />
<br />
Fur has blanked your body. It's cream on your chest from what you can see, brown elsewhere. You feel as though you're wearing a fur coat that's anatomically correct. It's a strange sensation to have fur all over your body. You feel dressed and yet exposed at the same time.<br />
<br />
A quick inspection shows that for what it's worth, you're still male.<br />
<br />
You remember hitting a picture of an otter. Your hands aren't webbed but your feet are; you have a thick tail and from what you can feel anyway, rounded ears and -- you gasp, you still seem to have human like hair. It's shoulder length.<br />
<br />
Turning around you see a cabin a short walk away.<br />
<br />
You're a naked otter man, in the woods by a cabin. You wonder if you should risk approaching it and knocking on the door. If there are humans there, they might freak out. Another otter person that might be dressed might also freak out. Running for it into who knows where doesn't seem wise either. If you found someone and told them of your situation, you wonder if they'd believe you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is asinine,&quot; you say. &quot;I can't stand around doing nothing. Someone must be able to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your voice sounds the same as you remember it anyway. You cringe at the idea that everything you know as reality might be a lie and this might be your real life. Likewise, the idea that you might never be able to go back to your life makes your stomach hurt. Blinking it off, you decide that standing around isn't going to make things better.<br />
<br />
You walk toward the cabin, the sensation on the ground against your feet strange yet also relaxing.<br />
<br />
As you reach what seems to be the front door, you take a deep breath and knock on it. You look at your hands as you wait for someone to answer. The top of your hands has short fur while the bottom look almost human with skin that's the same color as your human skin. You have short claws where your nails used to be.<br />
<br />
The cabin door opens. Standing before you is another otter person, a female one. Her coloration is lighter and black hair runs just below her shoulders. She's wearing a black teeshirt and shorts. She looks you up and down with a curious look. You estimate her age that assuming this species you've become ages at a human rate appears to be around her mid to late twenties.<br />
<br />
You try to see it from her point of view. A naked man just knocked on her door. In her position, you'd probably be curious but afraid as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually yes,&quot; you say. &quot;This is going to sound strange but I don't belong here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She folds her arms. &quot;Naked and in the woods? No shit. Seriously, is that's the best you have to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
You scratch at the back of your head and shrug your shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no, it's more complicated then that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd suggest you start explaining,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
You gulp and fiddle with your hands before stammering out the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you expect me to be smitten with you and throw my clothes off before we make hot love on the forest floor like two hormone crazed animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um well, no not exactly,&quot; you say. &quot;I mean that, no that's not what I'm here for!&quot;<br />
<br />
You try not to let the idea excite you too much. Without clothes, your body is practically going to announce any excitement you feel. It's both humiliating and annoying.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about that honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blink. &quot;Yes, I -- that's not why I pressed otter. I didn't know it would make me an otter person! Where is this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least it made you cute,&quot; the says. &quot;If this was a romance novel then perhaps I might but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I don't know why it made me naked,&quot; you say. &quot;I didn't mean to offend you; I'm just trying to figure out what's going on so I can get home and turn back into a human. Maybe that thing teleported me here because it knew you could help or maybe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
You do your best to concentrate even as your body responds to the thought of other motivations for ending up alone with an attractive female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe it wanted us to be together,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I shouldn't believe you but, you sound sincere,&quot; she says. &quot;Besides, you're cute so I suppose I can try to help. First, let's see if I can find something for you to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
She invites you inside, making sure to stay behind you at all times. The inside of the cabin is comfortable looking with what you see as modern furniture and appliances. She asks you to sit on a chair in the living room before she walks toward the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I'm a naked otter man, alone in a cabin with a beautiful otter woman,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Up until then, you'd only had a single girlfriend in your life and the relationship was platonic aside from the occasional kiss. You were always shy around girls despite having feelings for them. Some guys even thought you weren't interested in girls! The fact was that you just weren't sure what to do with a girl. You always expected that once you reached adulthood or even puberty that you were supposed to gain wisdom and to know just how to make a woman happy. When said wisdom didn't appear, you felt lost.<br />
<br />
Now, that shyness, while still there seems quieter. You feel more confidence that while not quite arrogance is combating that shyness. When the otter woman comes back with a pair of shorts, you smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope these fit you,&quot; She says. &quot;I don't remember bringing them with me. Maybe the thing that brought you here did it, I don't know. Unless you snuck in and put them here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up and she hands them to you. The back has another pant leg that has buttons on it. You realize that it's for your tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I...&quot;<br />
<br />
The otter woman blinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really don't know do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head. She walks over to you and helps you to put the shorts on. Despite embarrassment over not being able to do something on your own that you feel a toddler should be able to do, you enjoy her touch and being this close to her. Once you have the shorts on, she leads you to the bathroom where she has a body length mirror.<br />
<br />
You have to admit that you look good. If you were an otter lady, you just might be tempted to act upon instinct and do just what the otter lady jokingly suggested you do.<br />
<br />
She seems to (just for a second) leer at you. Before you'd be afraid she'd suggest something. Now, you almost want her to. Before, you'd feel like a pervert for even thinking that. Now, you feel it's normal to think that, perversion or the lack of it is whether or not you choose to act on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could give you one of my shirts but they're probably too small for you,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's all right, thanks,&quot; you say. &quot;I'm just not sure what to do. I meant it when I told you were I'm from and that I'm not here to -- you know? I mean, you're attractive and -- I've just never -- I feel like there's no right way to say this!&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles. &quot;Relax. We're not animals, it's not like I expect you to jump me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can sense that she's uncomfortable with the topic. You are as well and are glad when she changed the topic.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you're from another world eh?&quot; she asks. &quot;Well, if that's true, then I suppose you want to know about this world.&quot;</p>
