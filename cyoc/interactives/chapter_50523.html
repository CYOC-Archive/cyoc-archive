<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chester had been, of course, asleep. If Chester had been awaken, the tiny Chihuahua <br />
would have likely barked and stirred up a ruckus which would have inspired Julie to end <br />
her shower early, and have seen Alice for the first time and would have gotten her children <br />
away from the reflective television and would have prevented her daughters from <br />
becoming part of the Big Bad Wolf Pack.  But Chester had been snoozing, the dog oblivion <br />
to the changes, and since Alice had been on the other side of the mirror, she gave no <br />
scent for the dog to trace.   Chester just kept on dreaming of being the size of a mountain <br />
and stepping on self-important cats as if they were ants. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Alice took her cousins/half-sisters paws and gently pulled them out of view of the <br />
reflective surface of the television's glass. It wouldn't do any good to have them seen by <br />
their mother until after they had their plot finalized.   Alice remembered the Transform <br />
that had made into Alice had said those who were not part of the pack who she brought <br />
into the mirror would become like her, but then gave an  abridged description of her state. <br />
She hoped all the details were included, (liking not minding not breathing, eating, sleeping <br />
etc, in outer world).   <br />
<br />
Abbey and Samantha politely waited for whatever Alice had to say, and Alice remembered <br />
that anyone she transformed via this method according to the Transform would listen to <br />
her as well as love and be loyal to father.  'Of course 'listen to' can mean a lot of things. <br />
And this game, while showing to be rather proper when taking in the spirit of most details, <br />
has shown to be very sloppy at times.' Alice remembered the error of semantics that had <br />
resulted in Zackery not being bound by total and absolute loyalty to Jensen.   One thing <br />
Alice did notice was that her cousins/half-sisters didn't become seven and a half year olds <br />
but remained five year olds. 'Is this because they were already little girls?'  Alice wondered. <br />
Part of Alice did feel this damaged their symmetry somewhat, but The Game was rather <br />
unruly about such details and Alice figured she should take what she could get. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now please,&quot; Alice began, &quot;Tell me everything you remember about the strange lady.&quot;  <br />
Alice figured they had until Aunt Julie got out of the shower, then it would be time for her <br />
cousins/half-sisters to do their thing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will we get to see father soon now Alice?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I promise. We'll go right to your parent as soon as we get your mother to come along <br />
to where to meet.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So dear, I mean Master.&quot; Kaylee said leaning against her mate, &quot;What SHALL we do with <br />
Zackery's parents? And don't forget we need to explain ultimately to the school why <br />
Zylphia is no longer attending.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen said, &quot;I know, that is trouble. We'll have to do something about that. We'll need to <br />
have the school informed Zylphia will be home schooling from now on. With a Dare that'll <br />
be simple. Transform it could get complicated, unless we include a timer like we did with <br />
Jack and Marcine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You make it sound like you aren't going to decide what to do with them.&quot; Kaylee said <br />
simply as she and mate sat in the tea room as Darla and Fran (both worried the longer <br />
Alice took and wanted to get removing Master's bandages out of the way as lightning fast <br />
as possible so they could go back to their plot involving luring Julie back to Glendale). <br />
<br />
Darla barked that Alpha Female wasn't paying attention as much as she should have (the <br />
dummy to practice on would be there in a day).  First-Aid, Martial Arts: Kaylee personal <br />
felt she was almost back in high school. <br />
<br />
 &quot;I don't know what they're going to become... I'm going to let Zack decide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Kaylee said as did Fran and Darla. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'm not giving him a turn back, one of the clink will do it, and the others will be <br />
there as witnesses. I intend to test his loyalty to see if it's worth using a turn to make him <br />
magically loyal to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee wondered, &quot;Once one IS loyal via magic, and the Game has come and gone, is it still <br />
magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Good question but not the real point. The point won't be see what Zackery turns them <br />
into precisely, it's to see if he tries to include a detail that makes them loyal to him over <br />
me or something else that'll grant him an unfair advanage.  Otherwise, as long as he keeps <br />
in a part of them making it legal for Zylphia to just vanish, he can make them into wolf <br />
paper weights, a loli fountain, wolf pups, gargoyles, or two more of your anime she-<br />
wolves for all I care.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Kaylee said, hoping for the busty anime she-wolves. While she didn't like the <br />
extras, she also couldn't help but feel the excitement at creating new ones like an artist <br />
like creating a master work from a block of marble. <br />
<br />
&quot;There you go Master.&quot; Darla said, taking off the bandages showing the fully healed legs a <br />
couple of tiny scars from Kevin and Marcy's fangs. <br />
<br />
Jensen tested out his legs and flexed the muscles. &quot;Good as new.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We're very happy to hear that Master.&quot; The twins declared happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;So am I.&quot; Kaylee hugged him from behind pressing her breasts against his back, &quot;So am <br />
I... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master..&quot; Fran began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we..&quot; Darla continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you can.&quot; Jensen finished.  <br />
<br />
&quot;THANK YOU MASTER!&quot; The twins declared happy to be back on the road to getting their <br />
dearest Julie into their new family. They only hoped Alice was doing well with Abbey and <br />
Samantha. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister.&quot; Darla asked as they left the tea room to continue their plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do believe I now love Julie the way you love her.&quot; Darla commented kindly as they <br />
walked in perfectly step with each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well sister, as you've been reminding me, our Transform did include for us to feel the <br />
same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To act the same, look the same, think the same, feel the same, and be the same Sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So now I wonder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As do I wonder sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once Julie becomes our triplet, how precisely shall we love each other?&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran put a paw on her twin's shoulder, the other dirty blond did the same a moment later, <br />
&quot;That's a very good question sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there's only one way to answer it isn't there sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. For when we bring Julie into the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope my daughter is doing well with yours.&quot; Darla said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure she is sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't jinx it sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not a licensed foreman are you?&quot;  The foreman asked Caroline. <br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not. But it's how my pack expects me to take care of things, and thus how I do. I <br />
oversaw the revision of the entire house.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And the house didn't collapse on itself? No offense but I'm honestly impressed, this isn't <br />
kids playing building blocks and with a house THAT big... well, here's hoping your glues <br />
and thumb tacts all hold.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Humph. I'm just here to make sure you don't touch something you shouldn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry we'll have your new and improved gate up before the start of the work week.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This sure is interesting, right kiddo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah!&quot; Caroline said not amused, &quot;You and Ulysses shouldn't be out here! I'm out here <br />
only on orders, none of the pack is to go outside on the front yard until the gate is fully <br />
upgraded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Caroline, we're just here to see how things get done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can find that out on the educational channel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All they show now are 'Day in the lives of lumberjacks,  day in the life of antique dealer, <br />
and day in the life of a car restorer and seller,' and if you're really lucky 'history of a <br />
technology' if you're lucky.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't my concern Sarah, you're ignoring orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I'm just showing it to Ulysses that's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not five. He's not a pup. So -please- just go back inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses lowered his head, and leaned closer to Sarah, the cubs, the males, the females, <br />
even if he got older he had the feeling he still wouldn't belong with Zackery and the <br />
others. <br />
<br />
The lavender Sarah put a around around the purple Ulysses's shoulders, &quot;Okay kiddo, let's <br />
head back inside...&quot; <br />
<br />
At least he felt at home with Sarah nearby, he was always so confident and cheerful, he <br />
looked up to that. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Pearl June and Beatrice continued to play cards, mostly at Pearl's insistence. Pearl played <br />
with a nasty headache, leading her to making some impulsive and reckless decisions. June <br />
was doing well with pin point precision. Beatrice was in the middle of the three in the <br />
game progress, but both Beatrice and June were quickly becoming bored with the game.  <br />
Pearl smiled nervously at the two again and again. Pearl looked rather annoyed. Beatrice <br />
was wondering what the point of all of this was. <br />
<br />
Pearl spoke nervously, &quot;So how's the weather?&quot;<br />
<br />
The silver/gray June said flatly, &quot;Couldn't care less.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beatrice, &quot;Seems rather sunny like it's been all week.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pearl shuddered, &quot;Guys, I mean, come on, let's have some fun.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey June! You in here?&quot; Said Megan coming into the room finding her partner in <br />
construction, &quot;You've been avoiding me and can I just ask why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't with your brothers?&quot; The plain green Beatrice asked the pastel green Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't joined at the hip, and, something about him since his upgrade makes me feel <br />
uncomfortable somehow.&quot; Megan didn't feel uncomfortable speaking about her brother to <br />
her former fellow work hands, after all, they were Big Bad Wolves like her. <br />
<br />
The pearly Pearl asked making herself smiling, &quot;What's to be uncomfortable about? We're <br />
all members of the pack right? And we're all loyal to and love Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
All the she wolves nodded at this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Beatrice said, &quot;Pull up a chair, this game was getting boring but maybe you <br />
can help liven it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need for that! Maybe we can play something else!&quot; Pearl said not wanting someone not <br />
in on the secret of the unauthorized turn and the Dare June was under to be nearby since <br />
that would defeat the whole purpose of this and make it utterly pointless and a waste of <br />
time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now Pearl,&quot; Beatrice said, &quot;We're all members of the pack right? All family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl tried to say something but found no words to say. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Trevor sighed, he almost felt like he was just walking in circles almost. At least he hadn't <br />
run into Queen yet. He had a feeling the longer he was out here the more Queen finding <br />
him was just a matter of time.  Still. Glendale's cats saw things nobody else even bothered <br />
to worry about a cat seeing, and could certainly smell things that humans could never <br />
hope to.   Madam Serenity's gamble that Abbey and Samantha's 'imaginary friend' was <br />
really connected to whoever had been using the game like it was going out of season -<br />
was- their only lead. Well, that and the crazy old man who talked about the walking dogs. <br />
So the blond wolf in the mirror was slightly more likely to be connected. Heck, who was to <br />
say that imaginary friend -wasn't- the girls' father transformed? It was no more insane <br />
than the death biological sentence Trevor had been given. <br />
<br />
And given the rivalry and dislike between cats and dogs, it made sense that cats would <br />
keep track of their hated enemy's movements and any new ones in town.  Trevor just <br />
hoped that four giant dogs that moved about like they were humans was enough to catch <br />
some cat's attentions. And of course Trevor happening to find that particular cat and being <br />
able to tell Trevor something interesting. <br />
<br />
Trevor did run into a large cat sitting on the sidewalk with a collar looking out into <br />
nothingness, not exactly unusual for a cat, but there was something about those eyes that <br />
sent shivers down Trevor's tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hello.&quot; Trevor began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; The male cat said in an empty monotone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was part of a long well bred and expensive breed. I was worth a fortune. Then my <br />
Master died in an accident. And I wandered about looking for my way home, losing my <br />
collar, and a bunch of low class peasants found me... they took me in and treated me as if <br />
it was common... then... then they destroyed me... they took away my line... my future is <br />
gone... I was destine to breed to continue my line tracing it's roots all the way back to <br />
ancient Egypt and Bast... but now... I'm less than nothing....&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor took several steps back, &quot;... Not many people, I mean cats, I mean us, don't ask you <br />
how you're doing do they?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... do you know where a group of mollies are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... spread your seed where you can when you can young tom, otherwise you'll wake <br />
up one morning in a cage to find your human has betrayed you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The weed garden with the wild catnip. The old man never ever comes out anymore, and <br />
his dog can't smell a thing and is blinder than blind...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... thanks... &quot; The last thing Trevor needed was catnip to render him dooped up. &quot;Have <br />
you smelled or seen a bunch of very big dogs? That walked on two legs like they were <br />
humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... yes.... a big bad black one built like a tank, and a dark one colored like dog poison.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Chocolate.' <br />
<br />
&quot;She had those weights on those chests all adult human females have.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Breasts.'<br />
<br />
&quot;So... any idea where they were going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't saw them once. Yesterday I think, or was it today? Or the day before yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... right.... look, do you remember what way they went?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They went through the park, that's all I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... welcome young tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor left the neutered male to his self pity. <br />
<br />
In the park Trevor saw several cats with owners, most of them only gave him a few <br />
glances, though a few kitten with their queen waved at him saying he was cute. Trevor felt <br />
sick to his stomach.  Now he just needed to find the scent of the giant dogs that had come <br />
through here... and figured out to tell it apart from all the other dogs that came through <br />
the park on a daily basis.  &quot;Perfect.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor came up to a pair of mollies owned by an old woman reading 'Great Expectations.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there cutie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er,&quot; Trevor began, &quot;I need to know, have either of you seen a couple of strange large dogs <br />
lately that walk like they were humans?&quot;</p>
