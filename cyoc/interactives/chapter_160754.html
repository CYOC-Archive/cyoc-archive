<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The knock sent a shock down James&#39; spine. He sat bolt upright, his hands reaching for the waistline of his pants to quickly hoist them up. In his sudden fright he knocked his head on the top of the window causing him to yelp in pain. &quot;Ngh, fuck.&quot; He groaned, lightly rubbing the afflicted area before remembering about the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ngh, come in?&quot; He groaned again, still nursing his head. The door knob turned slowly as James steadily returned to a normal posture. His Mother had appeared, the first time she’d come to see him since she had broken the news about Jess and Henry. She shut the door gently behind her as she clopped in, wearing what looked to be a silk evening gown with a floral pattern. He hadn’t seen her in this before, but he thought it looked rather fitting. The hem came down to her knees and it was oddly form fitting around her chest. More so, James was surprised that he couldn’t smell her; either he was getting used to her or she had cleaned up a little. Joan quickly realised that James was nursing his head and rushed to his side. “Oh no baby, what happened?” She asked, forcing his hands away as she looked closer at his head. <br />
<br />
“Ngh, nothing mom, I just got a fright when you knocked.I was staring out the window and wasn’t exactly decent…” He trailed, trying not to give away too much. “Smacked my head on the top of the window, it’s fine.” He pleaded, not wanting to cause a fuss. <br />
<br />
Joan however was having none of it. Having patiently been keeping that Donkey at bay for weeks she decided it was time to push James’ buttons, just to see where his head was at.<br />
<br />
“Nuh-uh mister.” She scolded. “You could have a concussion! Or worse!” She moved towards the corner of James’ bed underneath the light before taking a seat. She gave James a look that he knew all too well, it would be easier to just follow along. “Come lay your head down on my lap. Let me get a good look in the light.”<br />
<br />
James swallowed loudly, frowning a little at the suggestion. Joan kept her cool as he nervously approached, climbing onto the bed and slowly lowering his head onto his mother&#39;s thighs.He could feel his ears twitch as they immediately made contact with something soft and lumpy. The fabric however felt smooth against his cheek, but it was thin; and with his face nestled right up against his mother&#39;s groin he could practically feel the outline of her package pressing against his cheek. What was more, is that he could smell it too, that strong undeniable goat odour. His heart tracked a little faster as he finally rested his head completely.<br />
<br />
“There’s a good boy.” Joan said with a hum, her fingers combing through James’ hair as she tried to find any lumps or bumps. As James’ heart rate increased he tried to focus on the conversation. If James didn’t know any better he swore he could have felt his Mothers penis pulse.<br />
<br />
“So - uh, what did you come over here for?” He asked, the stutter in his voice all too noticeable. <br />
<br />
“I just wanted to see how my baby was doing.” Joan replied matter-of-factly. “I’m worried about you. Last time we spoke you were so conflicted. I just hoped you’d have had some time to figure that out.” She spoke softly. Her fingers had begun to slowly transition from an exploratory probe to a gentle rub. James began to calm a little and words seemed to flow more easily.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know… I went to see Jess and Dad a while ago...” He began. <br />
<br />
“Oh? And how is the new couple.” Joan quickly interjected, her tongue laced with poison.<br />
<br />
“Oh - uh they’re... Fine? Still… Them. Jess was going through some things. She’s eating hay now, but it’s causing her some…. Wind issues.” He said politely. “But she’s come to terms with that now.” He finished, with his head staring out the still open window he hadn’t noticed the look of contempt on Joan’s face. ‘Prick will live with a stupid farting cow, but my scent is to strong! My scent is beautiful! He just doesn’t understand.” Her mind chanted, but appearances needed to be kept. “Oh that’s lovely.” She finally spoke.<br />
<br />
“...But it was something Jess said to me, about dealing with the changes. ‘We can’t control what&#39;s happening, but we can control how we feel about it.’ I haven’t been able to shake it all week.” He said with quickening speed. <br />
<br />
“The problem is, I don&#39;t know how I want to feel about things… When I went to see Jess, I saw her tits. Those big milky tits straining against her dress. Do you know what my first reaction was? Jealousy! Mine were smaller!” James kept the pace up, finally getting a chance to vent. “I told myself that I wanted a sign… I wanted her Mom... Dakota… But she hasn’t come back. I blew it.” Just talking about Dakota was making him impatient, he felt like he needed to wriggle about. The musk emanating from Joans cock was becoming more subtle, it’s pheromones drifting up James’ nose. It’s soft pudgy texture was quickly fading as Joans heart thumped in her chest, but she held on still. <br />
<br />
“Oh baby…” Joan cooed, gently stroking James’ arm now. “You don’t need to compare yourself to her, your breasts are just fine, I think they’re very cute.”<br />
<br />
James blushed at the compliment. As Joan sighed, continuing her speech.<br />
<br />
“You need to be wary that this animal might not fill you in the way that you’re wanting. Animals are fickle, off somewhere else, mating someone else -” She teased. “You need support from someone you can talk to, someone who can tell you, that if you feel like a girl… Then why not be one? No one here will Judge you.” Her hand sailed down her son’s leg, her fingertips gently teasing his rear.<br />
<br />
James breathed in deeply, taking in a noseful of Joan’s musk. His head burned, burned with the desire to be done with this once and for all, to make a choice. He was struggling to find a reason to hold on, to continue fighting. Maybe his Mother was right, maybe he was waiting for a sign that would never come. His boat with Dakota had sailed, but what did that mean for him?<br />
<br />
“If you were waiting on a sign to make a choice dear - why not let this be it? You know that if there&#39;s anything your Mom can do for you, she&#39;d do it.” Joan finished as James’ eyes widened. <br />
<br />
A Sign.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the image he held of Dakota, the longing he felt, the need to be mounted and taken, was replaced by that of his Mother. The warm bulge James felt against his cheek suddenly surged into the front of his mind as he took a deep whiff of the odour. It no longer smelled of goat, it smelled sexy, tantalising, so good that he just had to taste it. James smacked his lips, all the while trying to reply. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want you…&quot; James breathed heavily. &quot;To make me a woman!&quot; He exclaimed, the desire he&#39;d buried for weeks bursting to the surface. His head nuzzled against Jone&#39;s bulge as her faux restraint ended. The satin fabric tented in front of James&#39; eyes and he lashed out with his tongue, running it along the length of her bulging cock. He could taste it barely through the fabric; it wasn&#39;t enough. Before Joan could even react James pulled the dress up over her cock then quickly claimed his prize with his mouth. Joan groaned as her cock was enveloped. The both of them were so inexperienced on this side of the equation, but James knew enough about how he liked it, and quickly found himself off to a running start.<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s hands shot to the back of James&#39; head. Her fingers no longer tenderly teasing but gripping with meaning. Her buttocks clenched and her tail swayed as she weathered the horny young man&#39;s onslaught, but she had to hold herself steady, lest the fun end too soon. <br />
<br />
James&#39; own cock ached against his pants, and his pussy dripped with desire. After a few more gracious licks he pulled his face free from Joan&#39;s cock and quickly worked at his pants. &quot;Too tight… they need… to go…&quot; He panted, not waiting to catch his breath as he stripped. Joan could only watch in delight as the young man stood nude before her. Stripped completely naked he stood with two hooves, a swaying tail and furry ears; and an ample equine cock, behind which hid his human pussy. His cock was gleaming, but James couldn&#39;t care less about that now. There was a fire burning in his depths, depths he was only just starting to discover. The young man didn&#39;t even notice his abdomen slowly starting to discolour, a dark fur spreading across his midriff. <br />
<br />
With a moment&#39;s reprieve Joan finally regained some agency. The satin night gown she wore was promptly discarded, revealing her own morphed form, not dissimilar from her sons. They were almost mirror images of one another, the only real difference being the animal they were changing into. But as Joan further studied her increasingly needy son, she saw that was soon about to change. The black fur that coated his abdomen was bellowing out, protruding from his body while two smaller mounds popped their head through the thick brown fur - teets. What’s more was that his breasts seemed to swell in response, gaining at least another cup size. James&#39; attention however was on the object between his mother&#39;s legs and how good it would feel to have it inside him again, this time in the right spot.<br />
<br />
Joan approached, her fingers teasing James’ latest addition as she teased him. “Seems like you&#39;re doing a plenty good job of becoming a woman yourself.” Pivoting around him just to give him a slap on the ass. “Lay down on the Bed baby - Push that ass out in the air for me. Hurry!” She barked with urgency. She could feel her plans melting away as her own arousal grew. It was getting harder to concentrate when all she wanted was to sink her cock inside of James.<br />
<br />
James did as he was told, happily laying his front over the edge of the bed, his tail rasiign instinctively as his face rubbed against the sheets. This was it. This is what he had denied himself. He was finally about to experience it. He didn’t need Dakota after all. “Ngha!” James gasped as he felt Joans hands part his cheeks. The thick, throbbing warmth of her cock rested against his backside as it slowly began to lower itself. He could feel his lips shaking as the tip of Joans cock finally came to rest against them. Through gritted teeth James cried out, desperate and ready as Joan finally slid herself in.<br />
<br />
James was in Bliss as Joan slowly began working him back and forth.Her initially gentle approach quickly devolved into something more animalistic as the pleasure overtook the both of them. The pleasure that arched through her body masked the swelling in her temple, as small boney tips forced their way out of her skull, growing ever longer and curling every step. They arched backwards, rounding themselves over her ears before their points came to rest level with her nose.<br />
<br />
James’ was in ecstasy, not only being taken from behind, but his large cock sandwiched between his new teets and the bedsheet. It wasn’t long before he was teetering on the edge of climax, though still desperate for more. Giving Joan little warning his pussy convulsed, triggering a reaction that shook his entire body. Joan felt his lips clamp around her cock, sending her into her own throws of orgasm as she pushed herself in as tight as she could get, her grip tight on James’ seemingly plumper ass. <br />
<br />
They both remained speechless for a while, Joan still towering over her son, until she finally regained sensation in her legs. She stammered back, the tip of her cock popping free from James’ pussy, causing her seed to drip down to his balls. “Mhmm…” Joan moaned, taking in the sight. “Now there’s a good girl~” <br />
<br />
James’ heart pounded, the smile hard to wipe from his face as those words glided through his conscious - ‘Good. Girl’</p>
