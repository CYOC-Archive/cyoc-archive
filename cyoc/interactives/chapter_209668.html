<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning was calm for Harry and Dan. Because they had been so early with going to bed, they were also far earlier up then normal. And while Dan had slept over a few times already, he had clothes stored here, as well, meaning he had no need to return home before school.<br />
As it was, Kat´s spell was nearly finished connecting Dan to his objects, as his peaceful sleep had sped the process a bit. Not knowing how his day would take a nose dive shortly, Dan ate breakfast with Harry´s family before walking to school. Aunt Lisa had packed what was needed for the twins and was also departing after breakfast, having a longer drive ahead.<br />
<br />
It was the second class of the day, math, when Dan felt another light shock went through him, signaling that the spell had finished connecting him. He was about to ignore it, again thinking he had imagined it, when other sensations hit him.<br />
First, his mouth had suddenly run dry, and no amount of spit he tried to get in helped against it. Even when he drunk some water, his mouth stayed feeling dry. And, adding to that, was a weird taste all over his tongue, which he couldn´t define either cause nor what it was exactly.<br />
Second, and rather embarrassing, he felt his cock grow erect and hard inside his jeans, without any stimulation done by him. He had no idea what had caused this sudden change, but he was red for the bulge he had now.<br />
Third, his asshole seemed to be spread open. But what was more concerning, he felt a sudden wetness in it, making him squirm in his seat, hoping he wouldn´t wet his clothes. He would never live this down again if he just wet or shat himself in class.<br />
And fourth, his thumbs seemed to have gone wet, as well. Not only that, but he felt as if someone was sucking on them both, and not simultaneously, making it even more weird. Gazing down at his hands, Dan couldn´t find whatever was causing the sucking feeling, and neither did he find any wetness when he rubbed his hands.<br />
<br />
When it didn´t stop after a minute or two, he asked if he could use the bathroom, and quickly made his way there to check out his other problems. His ass had the same problem than his thumbs. While it felt wet, there was no fluids in it, to his touch it was bone-dry.<br />
Inspecting his dry mouth, it was the opposite of that problem. While it felt dry as a as a desert, it was clearly not dry in the mirror when he checked. But even when he held his head under the faucet to drink, even when water was clearly inside his mouth, it still felt dry. As if the water couldn´t reach the skin itself.<br />
He had looked over his cock when he had inspected his asshole, but beside having it pointing straight upwards, there was no sign as to why, nor was there any pressure behind it. It just stood there, stiff and unmoving. Dan had problems getting his jeans back over his pole, and it was clearly visible that he had a boner down there when he slowly returned towards his class. Lucky for him, nobody commented, but he couldn´t be sure if anyone had seen it.<br />
<br />
Nothing changed over the next few classes and breaks, leaving Dan nervous about it. What was happening to him?<br />
It was only near the end of the day in school, when one thing changed for him. The sucking on his thumbs ended, first one, then the other. But just as he relaxed over it a bit, the feeling returned, but this time, with his big toes. And it wasn´t just wet and sucking down there, but he also noticed it was rather warm for said toes. Also, the sucking seemed stronger.<br />
He couldn´t place why it felt like that. The rest of the class went slowly for him, and he was relieved to finally leave the day behind. Once outside, the sucking and wetness stopped around his toes, and after a sudden burst of cold streaming over his thumbs, followed by a bit of a rubbing feeling, they returned to their prior feeling of wetness and sucking. The same procedure happened to his toes shortly after, first a cold wave, the being rubbed as if to dry.<br />
Reaching home, Dan quickly hides inside his room, and tried to masturbate his still stiff cock. It had never gone down over the day, and he had heard a few snickers around him.<br />
But Dan couldn´t cum, he just didn´t get horny over pumping his cock. Nor felt he any movement inside it. Only his frustration about it grew bigger.<br />
“Maybe this is just a bad dream.” He thought, and tried waking up, but as he wasn´t asleep, nothing happened.<br />
Trying to distract himself, Dan started a game on his computer, as he couldn´t concentrate on his homework like this.</p>
