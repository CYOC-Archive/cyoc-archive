<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana decided to use the game again since she had fun regressing her children's ages. She wondered what else it could do. When she went to use it however, she discovered that the game is gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did the game go?&quot; she asked herself.<br />
<br />
She tried searching the Internet for it but to no avail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well&quot; she said, &quot;at least I can relive some of my years. Besides, I know that I'll be having four children total and two are going to be twins. This gives me plenty of time to prepare myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
16 years later Diana is 34 years old with her four children. Sarah is 16 and is Paul's girlfriend. She is also two months pregnant with Greg. Anna is 14 and has started dating Edmund. Tim and Jenny are both 12.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anna was up searching for the game that changed her life 16 years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot&quot; she said, &quot;I still can't find it. I wonder were it went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where what went?&quot; Tim asked coming into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just a game&quot; Anna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What game are you looking for?&quot; Tim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise not to tell Mom and I'll tell you&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Tim said, &quot;I promise not to tell Mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called 'X Reality'&quot; Anna said. &quot;I've been searching for it but I can't find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to find it&quot; Tim said. &quot;I know, I've been looking for it as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know about it too?&quot; Anna asked. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;16 years ago my best friend downloaded it&quot; Tim said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who was your friend?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacob Harris&quot; Tim said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My last name was Harris before I found the game on the computer&quot; Anna said, &quot;as was Jenny and your's. You two were my children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't a part of your family until something went wrong&quot; Tim said. &quot;The game made me a part of your family somehow. I don't know what happened as I was having sex with Jenny at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had sex with your twin sister&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wasn't my twin sister at that time&quot; Tim said. &quot;In fact she was Jacob just a few minutes before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you had become my new mother at that time&quot; Tim said. &quot;I tried to get you to turn off the computer when I was regressed to one year old. You didn't and I regressed to the womb and then I was someplace with blue light. I was just a ball of light there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I experienced that place&quot; Anna said, &quot;but I don't remember you trying to get me to turn off the computer. I just remember walking into the room for some reason and then leaving. Before I did I turned off the computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be because the aware was toggled off for you&quot; Tim said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense&quot; Anna said. &quot;I want to fix things but we need the game to do it. We have to find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Find what?&quot; Sarah asked coming in with her best friend Hannah and Jenny.<br />
<br />
Anna and Tim just stared at each other unsure what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you looking for a game called 'X Reality'?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
Anna and Tim sat there stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you are looking for it&quot; Hannah said. &quot;You're probably wondering how I know about that game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It did cross my mind&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you when Paul and Edmund get here&quot; Hannah said. &quot;They should be arriving anytime now if everything goes according to plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul's not coming over today&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Paul has a track meet to go to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither is Edmund&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll be here&quot; Hannah said. &quot;In the meantime I'll tell you why the game disappeared. We erased it to keep things from getting out of hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's this 'we'?&quot; Tim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a sec&quot; Hannah said checking her watch. &quot;Paul and Edmund should be coming in right about now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Hannah finished saying that Paul and Edmund did walk in.<br />
<br />
&quot;How's my mother to be?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little freaked out actually&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I thought you had a track meet Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was postponed because the stadium was bombed a couple hours ago&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have anything to do with that Hannah?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how did you know Paul would be here?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told that someone had a plan that would make it possible for Paul to be here today&quot; Hannah said. &quot;I didn't know what was going to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so who is this 'we' you referred to earlier?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm part of an organization that monitors reality&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Sometimes reality is changed by people. Sometimes it's a small change, other times it's a major change. When we find one that's a major change we try to change it back. You are all here because you were affected by someone changing you. Someone didn't like you being a happy family so they separated you by age and even managed to kick one of you out of the family. We had created a game to change reality and Jenny downloaded it 16 years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be&quot; Sarah said, &quot;Jenny is only 12.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality was different than what it is now&quot; Hannah said. &quot;16 years ago Jenny was a 16 year old boy named Jacob Harris. He invited Tim over to see the game he downloaded. He turned Tim into a one year old and made him wet himself. Tim decided to get back at Jacob by turning him into a four year old girl and made him wet himself. Tim then cleared the aware toggle for Jacob so he became Jenny. Jenny became 16<br />
again shortly after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is Jenny 12 instead of 32?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because there was a brown out which caused an error with the game and it regressed every one in the house&quot; Hannah explained. &quot;That includes Anna, Greg, and Anna's daughter Kathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so where do me and Paul come in?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna played with the game a bit before you and Paul came to see her and Greg&quot; Hannah explained. &quot;At that time you were her parents. She used the game to regress you back to age 16 and you became her little sister. After a night of sex you conceived a boy. Anna named him Edmund with the game. After that she found out see was pregnant with Jenny and Tim and aged them to one month old. She then aged Edmund<br />
to one month and regressed Greg to one month to compare them side by side. She went to return Edmund to your womb but she accidentally returned Greg to your womb. That's who you're pregnant with by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did Anna end up my little sister then?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It started with Edmund starting foreplay with Anna&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Anna was at the computer hoping to fix things when Edmund started his foreplay. It distracted her so much that she was hitting keys accidentally. She went into the bedroom to have sex since she was horny before and Edmund made her even hornier. Anyways you and Paul regressed to four year olds and Anna and Edmund regressed to six year olds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to interrupt&quot; Anna said, &quot;but Edmund left when he was 13.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True but the game continued to alter his reality as well&quot; Hannah said. &quot;If his reality didn't continue to change, he wouldn't be here now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wondered why he was the same age as me&quot; Anna said. &quot;Tell us what else you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well like I said you ended up as a six year old&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Of course you know that but the others don't. Anyways your mother came in and caught you at the computer before you could fix things. She spanked you and put you to bed. She then put a sleeping Sarah in her bed. After a bit she decided to check on the computer to see if you had done anything to it. That's when she discovered the game and she<br />
decided to regress her Sim. What she didn't know was that it would regress her too. I should mention that the game automatically toggles the awareness on for the user.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Jenny though?&quot; Tim asked. &quot;She was the one who clicked her Sim and progressed it to 16.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly Tim&quot; Hannah said. &quot;You see your hand was on the mouse and it was you who clicked it even though Jenny had pressed down on your finger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ok&quot; Tim said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still haven't explained how Anna became my little sister&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm getting to that&quot; Hannah said. &quot;So your mother figured out that the game alters reality and regressed Anna to two as a test. After she found out that Anna had become two she decided that four kids was too much at 18. She regressed Jenny and Tim to were they weren't even conceived yet as she did with Anna. She regressed you to just after conception. She went to take a shower and that's when we decided to<br />
remove the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because reality was just about changed back to what it was before&quot; Hannah said. &quot;We didn't want to take the chance that it would alter reality further than what Anna accidentally did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happens now?&quot; Edmund asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now you'll be able to fix reality to what it was&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Give me a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah pulled out a cell phone from her purse and opened it to reveal a screen and keyboard. She began typing on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a question for you Hannah&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Why didn't you tell us this before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two reasons&quot; Hannah said. &quot;The first reason is we needed to wait until you became pregnant. The second is that as a field op I have to blend in and can't talk about this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you telling us this?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was given permission to&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Before you ask, I don't know why they gave me permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah's cell phone chimed and she looked at what had arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that from your organization?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Hannah said. &quot;The game is back on your computer and it looks like they sent a possible answer to why I've been allowed to tell you this. It seems that I'm to become your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Anna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I've been given authority to override any changes you make&quot; Hannah said. &quot;I guess it's to make sure that things don't get too far off track like they did before. They have given me instructions on what to do on the game. They forbid me from using the game directly so one of you will have to follow what I tell you to do. Since you're already at the computer Anna, you should do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll start the game&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes the game started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Hannah said, &quot;first click on Sarah and select Greg.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna does what Hannah said to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I have Greg up&quot; Anna said, &quot;now what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now pick one month above the prenatal line&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
As soon as Anna did this Sarah's belly expanded until it was obvious she was nine months pregnant. There was a flash of light and Sarah was holding a one month old baby boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next you have to click on Edmund and regress him to one month&quot; Hannah said. &quot;I'll hold Greg for you Sarah as you'll need to hold Edmund for the next part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I how to do this&quot; Anna said as Hannah took Greg from Sarah. Anna clicked on Edmund and made regressed him to one month.<br />
<br />
They all watched as Edmund regressed, growing younger in a matter of seconds. Being 14 Edmund didn't have much muscle definition, though what he did have quickly melted away. His blond hair grew a little lighter as he approached one month and thinned. At around six years he started getting a little chubby as baby fat appeared on him. His clothes were changing with him. They started out as a blue tank top,<br />
blue denim shorts, and sandals. They went to a Power Rangers tee shirt, Power Rangers swim shorts, and Power Rangers sandals. Finally Edmund was a one month old boy wearing only a diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you do anything else Anna&quot; Hannah said, &quot;make sure that the aware toggle for Edmund is off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Anna said as Sarah picked up Edmund.<br />
<br />
Anna made sure that the aware toggle was cleared for Edmund and then selected two months after conception. There was a flash of light and Sarah was no longer holding Edmund but her swollen belly instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooof&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
Sarah's belly quickly shrunk as Edmund continued to regress until Sarah was two months pregnant with Edmund.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that felt strange&quot; Sarah said. &quot;It was a bit weird going through my pregnancy in seconds but it was even weirder going through it backward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Hannah said sitting Greg down, &quot;age Greg to 14.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; Anna said as she selected Greg and chose 14.<br />
<br />
Greg rapidly grew older until he was 14.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's great to see you again Anna&quot; Greg said as he embraced Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's great to see you too Greg&quot; Anna said. &quot;Now shut up and kiss me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them shared a long, passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you two&quot; Hannah said as they broke their kiss, &quot;we still have a little bit to do here. You still have to make me your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ok&quot; Anna said sitting back down at the computer. &quot;Now what do I do to make you our sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a sec&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Were you originally our sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I wasn't&quot; Hannah said. &quot;My bosses must feel that this will be an acceptable change to reality. Like I said before, I'm a field op so I'm usually placed were I won't have much of an impact on reality. I'm usually placed somewhere for at most a few days. This time though it looks like I'm going to be your sister for quite awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you been my best friend?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only two days&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember being best friends since we were six years old&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have those same memories myself&quot; Hannah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you just said that you've been my best friend for two days&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now you're telling me that you have memories of being my best friend for ten years. Which one is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's both actually&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Two days ago I was assigned to your case. At that time reality was altered so that I was your best friend for ten years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you have both memories?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because her awareness was on&quot; Anna said. &quot;I had the same thing happen with Edmund. I knew he was my brother or nephew but at the same time new memories were telling me he was my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband!&quot; Greg said in shock. &quot;Please tell me you didn't have sex with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked down at her feet and mumbled &quot;I'm sorry but I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you break our marriage vows like that?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't break your marriage vows&quot; Hannah said. &quot;At the time she had sex with Edmund the reality was that she was married to him. She had accidentally switched you with Edmund. She tried to fix it when she found out but she was horny when she tried. Then Edmund came in and started with some foreplay. Anna tried to resist but she couldn't with reality the way it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's alright that she cheated on me?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me something&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Are you married to Anna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Greg said, &quot;I mean yes. Why did I say no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because in this reality you are not married to Anna&quot; Hannah said. &quot;This reality takes precedence over the reality you remember. It can be confusing at times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She broke our marriage vows though&quot; Greg said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you still say the same thing if her awareness was off and the same thing happened?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well no&quot; Greg said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why is it different when her awareness was on?&quot; Hannah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because she was aware of our vows&quot; Greg said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was done in a reality were Edmund was her husband&quot; Hannah said. &quot;That reality took precedence at that time. If you want to be mad at her then you should be mad at yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because in a different reality that I remember&quot; Tim said, &quot;you were married to another woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can that be?&quot; Greg asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny was having sex with Tim at the time and her mother came home early&quot; Hannah said. &quot;She was afraid of being caught so she used the game to make her mother five and she became her sister and Anna became your wife. You don't remember it since your awareness was off at that time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's where the game came from&quot; Anna said still looking at her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I understand now&quot; Greg said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you a little hint&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Focus on the reality that you are in. If you keep thinking about other realities that you remember you could go crazy. I know from first hand experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok enough of this&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We still need to make Hannah our sister. So how do we do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First you need to click on me&quot; Hannah said, &quot;then select the Family Relations option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Anna said as she did what Hanna said. &quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now select the Change option&quot; Hannah said. &quot;Next type in Kelly as last name. There will be a message asking you to confirm the change and three options. One will be to make me your cousin, another will be to make me your sister, and the other one will be to make me your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
The message came up just as Hannah said. Anna clicked yes when it asked if she wanted to change Hannah's family relations. Next the three options came up.<br />
<br />
Daughter of Diana Kelly<br />
