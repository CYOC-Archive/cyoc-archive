<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He&#39;d masturbated before to the pictures in Sailor Sluts, Bare Beavers, and Chopper Chicks, all magazines given to him by his uncle Ted. But he&#39;d never really given thought to what the beautiful woman in the images must have felt as she was mounted by some dude, or used something to self stimulate herself. It had always been the images of a woman, naked as the day she&#39;d been born, exposing herself to the world that had worked.<br />
<br />
Now, as Marty pinned him in place, mounted him, the part of his mind that was still Warren and was still very much human thought back to those pictures and looks of sheer pleasure the women had made. And as his body, and part of his mind, submitted, Warren found he couldn&#39;t help but think, &quot;Dear god,&quot; and, &quot;Holy shit,&quot; among other things as he felt what he could only describing as the most satisfying experience he&#39;d felt. And so overwhelmed by it, he found himself curious if all girls felt like this when sexually aroused, stimulated, and eventually had a throbbing dick stuck in them before wondering what it would be like if he tried having sex as a human, either as a guy or as a girl, or both, it didn&#39;t matter.<br />
<br />
He knew he didn&#39;t have to worry about getting pregnant. Even though Marty exhibited behaviours typical of unfixed cat, something that puzzled the vet, who insisted he shouldn&#39;t, the family owned cat that Warren often took care of more than any of the others was neutered. What did bother him was the pain he felt when Marty finished and withdrew his barbed shaft. A uncontrolled yowl of severe discomfort escaping him, Warren glanced back at the tomcat, who seemed to have lost interest and setting to grooming himself, taking his time when it came to his female cat parts, Warren wondered if this was normal behaviour. Having never paid attention when Marty was on the prowl, Warren had no idea.<br />
<br />
Finished, he sat for a moment. The sun winked off the Amulet of Zulo and as he squinted and looked at it, Warren reassessed his desicion to hide and ride out the time. The part of him that was a female cat, both mind and body, still felt the need for a male, but now it wasn&#39;t as strong as it had been. Glad for this, a low purr escaped him as he wondered what he should do. Blue eyes still focused on the necklace, he considered that what he should do first was to find someplace to hide it for when he was ready to use it.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at where he&#39;d left his clothes, and unsure what to do about them, he hoped that they would remain undiscovered until he could come back and touch the Amulet of Zulo to them. Dipping his head down, he worked at it a bit until he had the chain secure in his mouth. About to resume dragging it the rest of the way across the yard, he hissed and lost his purchase when a female voice squealed out, &quot;Rune. What are you doing outside,&quot; and before he knew what had happened, Warren found himself scooped up and cradled as the neighbour girl crooned, &quot;You are a very bad kitty,&quot; then inquired, &quot;Oh. What&#39;s this,&quot; and before Warren could fathom what was going on, Kathy switched her hold of him to one hand as she picked up the Amulet of Zulo.<br />
<br />
Human mind fully reasserted, Warren, as much as he didn&#39;t want to be a female cat, did not want to be owned by the girl. Squirming, he tried to get away, but found himself pressed tighter against the girl&#39;s body as she slipped the necklace into her pocket, then secured her hold on him with her other hand. A hiss and he was about to sink his claws into her arm, when she scolded, &quot;Rune. You knock that off. You hear me,&quot; and as he squinted his eyes and tried to look up at the girl.<br />
<br />
Finding he couldn&#39;t turn his head that far, he hissed again and made a low rumble as she shifted her hold so that his paws were now folded uncomfortably and no longer in easily reach of scratching her. Carried across the yard, out into the alley, and down toward the next house over, Warren tried to think how else he might get her to release him. But then he remembered the amulet, which he found he couldn&#39;t recall what she&#39;d done with it after she&#39;d picked it up, and surrendering himself to the truth that, until he could find the Amulet of Zulo, which he was sure Kathy still had, he was stuck as her pet.<br />
<br />
Displeased by such an idea, he glared up at the girl when she dumped him on the kitchen floor, and watched to see if she would take the necklace out from wherever she&#39;d put it. When she instead kicked off her shoes and headed out of the kitchen, Warren stood and followed after. Through the house and upstairs, he got only as far as her bedroom door, when she stopped and told him, &quot;No, Rune. You know you aren&#39;t allowed in my room,&quot; before she pushed him away with a foot and stepped quickly into her room.<br />
<br />
The door shut in his face, Warren glared at the door, then up at the door handle. His curiousities and ideas gone astray, an instinct he didn&#39;t know he had asserted itself and he leap up and grasped it with his monkey-like cat paws. He wanted the necklace, or would settle for where it was, but either way he wanted it now as he wriggled back and forth. When it refused to turn, and he realised Kathy had locked it, Warren dropped heavily to the floor. A glance upward and he squinted his blue eyes before he started to yowl as loudly as he could in desparate need to not only communicate his frustration, but what he wanted, the Amulet of Zulo, and what he did not want, which was to be stuck as a female cat.<br />
<br />
From somewhere close a door opened and a woman&#39;s voice called out, &quot;Rune. Stop that,&quot; and before could Warren could understand what was happening, someone he guessed was Kathy&#39;s mom appeared in the hall and proceeded to chase him away from the door with the simple word, &quot;Scat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Driven back downstairs, he wandered into the kitchen, where he sniffed disdainfully at the bowl of mixed wet and dry cat food in the before ambled out and towards the living room. There, Warren flopped down in a warm patch of sunlight and lazily flicked his tail. For lack of better words, he found the &quot;ache&quot; the &quot;want&quot; in his female parts still persistent, but not as bad as it had been when he&#39;d first turned into Rune. Finding he could at least focus on other matters he thought important, Warren tried to figure out how he was to get the amulet back.</p>
