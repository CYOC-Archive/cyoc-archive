<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Andrew slowly roused, he found himself not on the bench in the VR cabin, but rather in a single bed situated in what appeared to be a rustic shed. A delicious aroma wafted through the air, the mouthwatering smell of breakfast rousing him fully from his sleep.<br />
<br />
Standing at the foot of his bed was an anthropomorphic vixen, her fur the colour of a fiery sunset. She stood tall, her svelte figure clothed in a faded blue blouse and a bottom-hugging brown skirt. Her eyes sparkled with intelligence and she carried an almost motherly aura. The sight was disorienting, to say the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you&#39;re awake,&quot; she said in a voice that was smooth and rich, like polished glass. &quot;I hope you slept well.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes slowly trailed downwards, and his gaze fell upon a pair of propeller blades at the base of his vision. His heart raced, as he tentatively ran a paw across his face, the sensation sending a chill down his spine. In a daze, he stumbled up from the bed and moved towards a tall cabinet that stood against one wall. He opened it to reveal a full-sized mirror.<br />
<br />
What looked back at him was shocking.<br />
<br />
Andrew was no longer a human – he was an anthropomorphic raccoon. His body had taken on a muscular, yet nimble physique, clothed in a tan leather jacket that was worn and creased with years of use. The fur collar of his jacket hugged his neck, fluffy and warm. His beige pants hugged conforms to his lower body, ending in worn brown boots that enveloped his feet. On his head, he wore a leather pilot’s cap, complete with goggles resting lazily around his neck, their lenses gleaming in the soft light.<br />
<br />
His face bore the dark grey, almost black, mask-like patches around his eyes, typical of raccoons. A layer of soft, silver-grey fur covered him from head to toe, contrasting sharply with the black fur around his eyes and head. His raccoon ears perked up atop his head, twitching a little with every unusual sound.<br />
<br />
His tail was bushy and striped in a pattern of black and grey-like raccoons typically have, but the most alarming of all was the mechanical addition to his tail. Attached to his tail, were the horizontal and vertical stabilizers found at the tail end of a plane. These were also strategically painted black and grey, camouflaging perfectly with his tail.<br />
<br />
The vixen chuckled at his startled expression. &quot;You better get used to that face,&quot; she said, gesturing towards a breakfast table laden with fruits, eggs, toast and a pot of hot coffee. &quot;We&#39;ve got work to do, and I don&#39;t do tardiness. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
His growling stomach pulled him from his state of confusion. It was time for breakfast.<br />
Practically inhaling his food, Andrew found himself eating much more energetically than normal. His non-human body seemed to require much more fuel. As he cleared his plate, the vixen waltzed out of the shed, beckoning him to follow her.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the cozy confines of the shed, Andrew found himself standing on a remote island. Apart from this small building and a seemingly deserted runway, there were no other structures present. His eyes scanned the environment for any trace of an airplane, but there was none to be found. A wave of confusion swept over him, followed shortly by the startling realization - he was the airplane.<br />
<br />
A surge of panic washed over him but was quickly quelled as he began to understand the extent of his transformation. As he frightenedly made his way towards the runway&#39;s end, he felt an odd sensation in his lower body. Looking down, he saw a third wheel emerging from between his legs, matching the wheels that were once his feet.<br />
<br />
This uncanny change, however frightening, was surprisingly comfortable. Andrew felt in control of these wheels, and with a sudden gust of confidence, he started to skate along the remaining distance.<br />
With his newly formed wheels supporting his weight, Andrew prepared for the upcoming changes. As he sat on the tarmac, an odd numbness washed over his thighs. Looking down, he saw his thighs seemingly liquefy, merging with the rest of his lower body. What was once flesh and bone wrapped in fabric was now converting into a solid, metallic form.<br />
<br />
Andrew’s body – his torso to be more precise – swelled, the brown fur of his raccoon form undulating and transmuting into a hard, smooth covering of cool metal. His clothes seamlessly blended into his body, becoming a part of the single, streamlined entity that his torso was mutating into. His arms lengthened dramatically, morphing into massive elliptical wings, the mechanical stabilizers on his tail adjusting to meet the new balance requirements.<br />
<br />
His legs, though shortened, kept their sturdy form and transformed into a robust landing gear. The wheels even seemingly upgraded, gaining a rugged tread indicative of intense grip. Meanwhile, his body elongated, outlining the classic streamlined shape of an airplane’s fuselage.<br />
<br />
Just as the changes seemed to dwindle, his back started to contour inwards, forming an undulating pattern that culminated in an array of switches, buttons and levers. A transparent canopy soon covered the entire setup, housing a single seat and complex flight instruments. A nifty steering wheel came forth, studded with a few more switches and buttons.<br />
<br />
Time leaped forward and minutes later, Andrew had fully become an airplane. His appearance was vintage, closely resembling the likes of the P-51 Mustang and Supermarine Spitfire. Yet, his design was unique, carrying an exotic blend of the vintage aura and futuristic innovation. The paint job was the most striking feature – a blend of different shades of gray and brown, similar to his previous raccoon coloring. It gave him an air of mystery and familiarity all at once.<br />
<br />
Rebecca, who had been waiting patiently at the edge of the runway, stared at him with wide eyes. The transformation was no less than a spectacle. She pushed off from the ground, her fox tail wagging in excitement as she picked up her clipboard and prepared to climb aboard the raccoon-themed vintage plane Andrew had become.<br />
As soon as Andrew finished transforming, he effortlessly slid open his canopy, motions natural despite his new form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; he said, his voice now sounded different, metallic yet friendly.<br />
<br />
Rebecca hopped in, a sense of excitement in her eyes. She quickly adjusted herself in the seat and buckled up. Andrew felt her weight settling into the cushioning of his seat, an odd sensation but not entirely unpleasant. Swiftly, his canopy slid closed, trapping them comfortably inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got to make a trip to Celestite Cliffs,&quot; Rebecca declared, her eyes skimming over the clipboard in her hands. &quot;They&#39;ve got a cargo of precious Bluestone jewels that need to be delivered to Silversand Harbour.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she dictated the details of their mission, Andrew rolled onto the runway, the new wheels beneath him rolling easily on the smooth tarmac. Internally, he could feel a powerful vibration starting to build, a tangible symbol of the horsepower latent within him. <br />
<br />
The vibrations in his body grew in intensity until they were powerful enough to make Rebecca voice shake slightly as she relayed the final details; an unseen force propelling him forward down the long stretch of the runway. With each passing second, his speed increased, the cool morning air rushing past his metallic skin, whistling over his wings, and streaming past his tail.<br />
<br />
Finally, reaching the adequate speed, Andrew could feel the primal urge of flight coursing through him. It was time. Flexing his wing flaps, he eased his nose skywards and started lifting off the ground. Like a massive bird, he spread his wings and ascended into the sky. <br />
<br />
The sensation was indescribable. Andrew&#39;s &#39;body&#39;, once a raccoon, then a plane, maneuvered through the air, its engine&#39;s powerful hum a comforting score as he soared higher and higher, leaving the small island behind.<br />
<br />
Rebecca was silent, merely lightly stroking the dashboard of Andrew’s cockpit, marveling at his ability to transition and control himself with such fluency and finesse. Finally, they were free of the ground and coasting through the open sky. The thrust of his engine vibrated through his entire frame, a sensation entirely foreign yet exciting as they embarked on their first mission.</p>
