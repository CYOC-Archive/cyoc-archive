<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat helped Dan out of his ridiculous looking shirt that he was helpless to take off, put a color and leash on her new pet and walked out the door. Dan&#39;s ears and tail drooped in humiliation at the thought of going out into the world looking this way, but what could he do? He followed her out into the sunlight, which soaked right into his black fur and made him pant harder. The air outdoors was like a psychedelic revelation to Dan. Smells and sounds from everywhere swarmed into his new nose and dive-bombed into his ears. He heard voices of dogs and people playing in the dog park that was still a couple of kilometers away. He felt the tug of the leash around his neck and kept plodding along even though he was still sniffing and listening trying to accommodate his sensory overload. He did adjust, but he couldn&#39;t even come close to filtering all of that out. It looked like a lot of his experience as a dog was going to consist of sorting through smells. He really didn&#39;t want to be seen sniffing the ground and the trees and the fire hydrants, but his senses were too overwhelming to ignore.<br />
<br />
Kat, for one, was glad Dan was acting more like a dog. He was going to be a fun pet to show off, especially to Selena. First things first, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boy, time to go pee,&quot; she said as they approached an inviting bush. He looked back at her with his ears perked up. She couldn&#39;t be serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well go on, Dan, we don&#39;t have all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was actually going to make him do this in public like a dog. He whimpered but decided to go ahead with it. He looked around to make sure no one was too close by or looking directly at him, then he sidled up to the bush, and went for it. He knew he would have to lift his leg. As the stream was flowing, curiosity got the better of him and he sneaked a glance back to see what it looked like. There was a pointy-looking tip sticking out the end of his sheath spewing his mark. &quot;Well, what do you know, my cock really is tucked in a pouch,&quot; he thought. He didn&#39;t really know much about dog anatomy (because he hadn&#39;t cared before), so up until that point he wondered if maybe his member itself was just furry. He went back to looking if anyone saw him but of course no one was paying attention. They just saw a rottweiler out for a walk with its owner.<br />
<br />
&quot;My owner, that&#39;s what my sister is now.&quot; he thought. &quot;I&#39;m gonna be sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan finished up, his sheath closed again, and they were on their way. He still wasn&#39;t yet used to that tail swinging back and forth as he walked, or the feeling of his paw pads cushioning his steps, but the sound of his claws clicking on the sidewalk was the worst. He couldn&#39;t stand hearing the sound of a dog&#39;s footsteps every time he made a move, not least because he could hear so much better than before. He kept on going though, wary of angering Kat.<br />
<br />
They got to the dog park, and Dan got a good whiff of all the dog, human, and nature smells all around him. He watched the dogs do the kinds of stuff he&#39;d be expected to do now: fetching sticks, catching frisbees, relieving themselves everywhere, sniffing each others butts (I&#39;m NOT doing that last one, he thought.) That&#39;s when Kat called out to a girl in blonde hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hi, Selena!&quot; It was her, Kat&#39;s best friend since elementary school. &quot;How are you doing today.&quot; They exchanged pleasant greetings. &quot;This is my new dog Dan,&quot; Kat told her. &quot;Oh wow, he looks just like that old dog I used to have!&quot; answered Selena. &quot;So he does,&quot; Kat said coyly.<br />
<br />
Dan got extremely self-conscious whether Selena guessed he was a &quot;he&quot; from his name or from seeing between his legs. The main reason he had always teased Selena about everything was because he was attracted to her, and he thought teasing was more macho than being nice to her. His pink tip was poking out, and all the introspection in the world wasn&#39;t sending it back in.<br />
<br />
Dan was of course very soon interrupted by Selena&#39;s current dog, her grayhound female named Starlight. She came up wagging her tail and stuck her nose under Dan&#39;s tail. He held very still, feeling very uncomfortable about this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, I think Starlight likes him,&quot; Selena commented. &quot;I think you&#39;re right,&quot; Kat said winking at Dan. They went back to talking about other things like what they were planning at the mall. Starlight barked and made a play bow. Dan stared looking confused. Starlight then looked confused. Dan was NOT going to be seen sniffing her butt. HOWEVER when he saw Kat and Selena weren&#39;t looking, he surrendered to his nose&#39;s temptation and allowed himself a quick whiff. He was shocked by how satisfying it was to expose himself to the complex assortment of distinct odors back there. It was like getting 100 channels on TV, but from an asshole. He deliberately pulled himself away though. Demeaning as it was, he knew he was expected to socialize with Selena&#39;s dog while Kat socialize with Selena, so he barked and bowed and wagged his tail as he&#39;d seen her do. This seemed to put the gray hound at ease, and she looked like she&#39;d want to play if they weren&#39;t on leashes. Dan realized he&#39;d forgotten what Kat and Selena were talking about.</p>
