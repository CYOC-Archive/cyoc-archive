<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; I hate you!&quot; The young girl said, rubbing her red and now tender rear end.<br />
<br />
&quot; I love you. That is why I correct you when you miss behave.&quot; Her father said to her reaching out to hold her. She pulled away from him and ran to her bedroom to get dressed for school.<br />
<br />
&quot; I wished that you could be the child and I could be the adult just once. Then you&#39;d see what it&#39;s like.&quot; She said as she slammed the door.<br />
<br />
He hollered through the door. &quot; I already was a child, and I did see. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to show you.&quot;   The girl just grunted. This was a frequent occurrence, at least when the girl needed punished. Kevin just shook his head. He didn&#39;t know what else to do. Amy was fourteen and almost unruly. He didn&#39;t want to spank her, he felt that at she was getting to old for that, but smoking was a very serious thing. He knew from experience that smoking cigarettes could, and often did lead to smoking marijuana and that usually led to taking other drugs. Besides, it was better that Amy didn&#39;t smoke cigarettes anyway. It was a habit that would be hard to shake later. He also knew this to be true, from experience since he smoked two packs a day and had been trying to quit for a couple of years now with absolutely no success. He had tried everything but nothing worked. He and his wife Marsha used hypnosis two years ago, she had quit . It made him quit for a week than he went right back to it. He went in and sat at the dinning room table with his coffee, he lit another cigarette.<br />
<br />
Marsha was still in their bedroom getting dressed. He tried to push this incident with his daughter to the back of his mind. He and Marsha had a lot to do today. He and Marsha started buying old houses at estate sales and foreclosure sales a few years ago. They would then fix anything that needed fixing and paint them. Then sell them. It took some time for him to get the hang of it, but eventually they earned enough at it for him to quit his job. He wanted to stay home and be with Marsha and Amy, because work had taken away from them so often when Amy was younger. He had gotten tired of being home without being there. He had become a ghost like figure in Amy&#39;s life. He felt that this was the reason why he and Amy could never seem to connect. Anyway, Marsha had decided to keep her part-time job at a local company as a Girl Friday, doing office work three or four days a week. She didn&#39;t have to work because he taught her how to do what he did, but she liked it.<br />
<br />
Marsha came into the dinning room carrying a cup of coffee. She was wearing a pair of old jeans and a flannel shirt. He crushed out his cigarette and said.&quot; Well, she hates me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marsha replied. &quot; She&#39;ll get over it. You&#39;re right. You couldn&#39;t allow that to go unpunished, and you said it yourself. This was just to severe for grounding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I know, but I can&#39;t help but feel that if I&#39;d have been here for her when she was younger maybe she wouldn&#39;t be so out of control now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; What are you going to do? Beat yourself up for the rest of your life, because you had to earn a living? You had no choice. Your here now, maybe you two can find a way to be friends. Perhaps you can even find a way to show her that you love her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I hope so. I would like that more than anything. I just want her to like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a way to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy came out of her room in a skirt that was too short. He had already forbade her to wear it, but she just had to try to make him mad. He left it go. They&#39;d had enough combat for one day. She kissed her mother, picked up her books and purse, and walked out the door. Giving him a knowing look.<br />
<br />
He turned to Marsha and said. &quot; Well dear, are you about ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; What did we have to do, now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; That kitchen floor needs stripped and waxed and those old trunks have to come out of the attic. You know, the ones that didn&#39;t sell in the auction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; It&#39;s funny. Hardly anything sold. Besides us buying the house, no one else really bought anything.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot; I know. Now we&#39;re stuck cleaning it out. I&#39;m hoping that we can find something that we can sell to make up for our effort. Like that antique free standing mirror. I&#39;m surprised that it didn&#39;t sell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;m sure an antique dealer would be interested in it along with some of the other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Well, I plan to go through those trunks before I move them, and every and anything else we find. Let&#39;s get out of here, shall we?&quot; He concluded, finishing the last of his coffee.<br />
<br />
When they arrived at the house Marsha got right to work on the kitchen. Kevin took a toolbox with him and headed upstairs to the attic. He knew that he would need to use a hammer and chisel to remove the locks from the three big trunks. Marsha told him to holler when he was ready to move the trunks and she would come up and help him. With that, he left her in the kitchen and went upstairs.<br />
<br />
In the attic, Kevin took out his tools and set to work on the first trunk he came to. After about twenty minutes of hard work he was finally able to break the lock. He opened the trunk. In it, he found about twenty-five or thirty diaries each had its own little locking leather strap. In the front corner of the trunk, he found a small jewelry box. He discarded the thought of opening the diaries and turned his attention to the jewelry box. There really wasn&#39;t much of a market for old diaries unless you were going to sell them back to their author. He opened the box, it had a little ballerina, that at one time probably turned around when the box was opened. It stood still now. He wound the key but it just spun in its socket. On the bottom of the box lay a necklace. There was a medallion on it. He picked it up and examined it more closely. Engraved in the medallion was what appeared to be an angel holding a wand, or maybe it was a fairy. Who knows? Who cares, anymore? It did look like it was gold. It might be worth something. After all, why would it be locked in a trunk if it wasn&#39;t worth something. He put it around his neck so it wouldn&#39;t get lost while he was working. Then he picked up his tools and started working on the next trunk.<br />
<br />
When he finally got it opened he found it full of baby clothes. He wondered why anyone would lock a trunk containing baby clothes. He figured that they may have hidden valuables under the baby clothes. So he decided to take the them out and see. He reached into the trunk and grabbed an arm load of clothes and took them out and set them on the floor. A cloth diaper fell off the top of the pile. He picked up and put it back on the top of the pile.<br />
<br />
All at once he felt strange. He felt a tingling in his groin. He dismissed it and went back to work. As he leaned over the trunk he felt woozy so he stood up and lost his balance. He stepped backward to catch himself and stepped on something that caused him to fall.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the floor he discovered what he had tripped on. His pants had fallen down around his ankles. Looking for a moment he noticed that his underwear were also around his ankles. He realized that his legs looked different. they were smaller almost like a child&#39;s legs. He stood up and looked around. everything looked bigger. He stepped out of his pants and pulled his feet out of his shoes in the process. His feet looked tiny. That was it! He ripped his shirt off and looked at himself. &quot; Oh my!&quot; He exclaimed. His voice sounded funny to him, but seemed to match the body he was looking at. His body was a lot smaller and all his body hair was gone, but the thing that had startled him was the fact that his groin looked like Amy&#39;s did when she was little. His manhood was gone. He went to the mirror to look at himself. He looked like an eight year old girl. His hair had grown out and everything.<br />
<br />
Just then Marsha reached the top of the stairs. She had heard a loud bang and came up to check on him. When she topped the steps she said. &quot; What the...&quot; Because she saw a little girl standing naked in front of the antique mirror, just staring at her reflection. Marsha stopped talking so she could make sense of what she was seeing. The little girl didn&#39;t seem to even notice that she had spoke. She knew that her husband was the only one up here, so who was this little girl?<br />
<br />
The shock from the realization of who it must be, almost caused her to fall back down the stairs. She drew a deep breath to try to calm her system, but it had only little effect. She said. &quot; Oh my god! Kevin is that you?&quot; This time the little girl heard her and turned toward her. For the first time she could see &quot;her&quot; features directly. She discovered that her first impression was wrong. &quot;She&quot; looked to be about six, not eightish like she had first thought. There was no doubt that &quot;she&quot; was a girl. &quot;she&quot; had blonde hair that fell to her shoulder blades in back. In the front were bangs to just above her eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot; Marsha! I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to me. I was looking through the trunks and somehow I turned into a eight year old girl.&quot; The little girl that was Kevin said in a childish soprano.<br />
<br />
&quot; You&#39;re not eight, you&#39;re six. No wait you look closer to five.&quot; Marsha thought she looked older when she first saw her. &quot; Kevin, I think your still getting younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to look in the mirror. She was right! He noticed that the posts supporting the mirror seemed to be growing taller. When he first came up to the attic and looked in the mirror, they were shorter than his shoulder. Then when he ran over to the mirror naked they were at eye level. Now they were above his head. He could also tell looking in the mirror that he looked to be barely five. He was getting younger right before their eyes. &quot; Marsha? What are we going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I don&#39;t know. let me think. We can&#39;t do much of anything until you stop changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Okay.&quot; The little girl said, as she started to cry.<br />
<br />
Marsha came over and held her. &quot; Its going to be all right. Don&#39;t cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I can&#39;t help it. I&#39;m scared. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m crying. I never did at a time like this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Well obviously its affecting more than just your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Marsha stepped back and looked, Kevin was about four. They continued watching silently as he became younger. When Kevin finally stopped getting younger, he ended up being about two years old.   For a long time neither one said a word, they just stared at each other. After several minutes they realized that he was no longer getting younger, he wasn&#39;t getting older either. Kevin turned around and looked in the mirror for a few moments. Then he moved a small hand to the area between his legs. A tiny finger slipped between the folds of skin that formed the outer lips of his new vagina. Finally, he said. &quot; Mawsha! I got wipth... wipth... WWWipthhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Lips?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot; Yeth... yeth...yeth.&quot; He tried several times again to use the correct pronunciation, but couldn&#39;t seem to make his mouth form them correctly. Frustrated, he wined. &quot; I even thound wike a widdle giwl. What am I going to do, Mawsha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;ll say. You sound as adorable as you look.&quot; He shot a dagger stare at her. She continued. &quot; First, you can&#39;t stand around naked. We&#39;ll have to get you dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; In what? My cwotheth don&#39;t fit me anymowe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I know that your clothes don&#39;t fit you now. I&#39;ll just have to find you something to wear in the trunk.&quot; She walked over to the trunk and began looking in it to see what was there. &quot; While I look in here for something to put on you. Why don&#39;t you tell me what happened before I came upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Okay, but I hate talking with thith voithe. I opened the fiwst twunk with da diawies. Den I opened dat twunk, I picked up a pile of cwotheth and put it on the fwoor. When I went to wook in the twunk, I twipped. I wooked at my feet and my pants and undaweaw wath awound my ankleth. I thdood up and thaw dat my wegs wewe thkinny and my thiwt wath down to my kneeth. I took it off and wooked in da miwwow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; That&#39;s it?! C&#39;mere I found you an outfit to wear. Before I put it on you. I don&#39;t want to hear you bitch. There isn&#39;t much of a selection, so I picked out the most reasonable things for you to wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marsha laid him down and put a diaper on him. He was going to protest, but Marsha cut him off. &quot; Don&#39;t say it. I know you don&#39;t want to wear it, but there is nothing else. Since we don&#39;t know how long you&#39;re going to be like this you&#39;re just going to have to suffer with them until I can get you something else, or until we figure out how to change you back. Which ever comes first.&quot; He fell silent. Next came rubber pants, then a little slip and a dress. Finally she put on socks and pair of little Maryjanes. Then she stood him up and put his, now long blonde hair, in high ponytails. &quot; Before you bitch. I put your hair in ponytails to keep it out of your face. She gave him a little push toward the mirror and he walked over to it, a little unsteadily.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror. The most adorable little girl looked back at him from inside the mirror. He said. &quot; Unbewievable! I wook wike Amy when she wath two. I&#39;m down wight pweddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Cute as a button to be exact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I don&#39;t want to be cute I want to be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I know you do. The only thing I can think of is to look through those diaries and see if there is something in them about this.&quot; Marsha looked at the diaries and said. &quot; That&#39;s going to take some time, since I&#39;m going to have to get them opened first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marsha picked him up and got a few toys out of the trunk were she&#39;d taken the clothes from and carried him down to the living room. Once there, she set him on the floor and put the toys in front of him.<br />
<br />
He looked at her and down at the dolly, bottle, and rattle. Then he looked up at her and said. &quot; What are you doing now? I&#39;m not a chiwd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Well, I don&#39;t want you to fall or get in my way while I&#39;m carrying the diaries to the car. I also didn&#39;t want you to get bored. Unfortunately, These are the only things here for you to occupy your time with. I guess you&#39;ll just have to make the most of it, sorry.&quot; With that she went back to the attic.<br />
<br />
After she carried all the diaries to the car she took a paper sack from the car and put some of the clothes in it, so he had something to wear. All of the clothes were very feminine. She was pretty sure he wasn&#39;t going to like that. After she put the sack in the car, she went into the living room to get him. She found him laying on the floor sleeping with his tiny thumb in his mouth. She wished she had a camera, because she knew that he would never believe this, after he woke up. She picked him up along with his toys. He stirred and took his thumb out of his mouth and slowly began to wake up.<br />
<br />
By the time she put him in the car and buckled his seat belt, he was a lot more coherent but not yet fully awake. He looked up at her and said. &quot; Honey. I had da siwwiest dweam...&quot; He trailed off, his eyes opening wide. He looked down at himself, if his eyes could&#39;ve gotten any wider they would have. He continued. &quot; It wasn&#39;t a dweam. I weewy am a widdle giwl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I know, dear.&quot; She felt bad for him, but there was nothing she could do until she found out what made him turn into a little girl.<br />
<br />
She walked around to the driver&#39;s side of the car and got in. She started the car and headed for home. As she was waiting for a red light a police officer pulled up beside her. He looked over at her and smiled. She turned to Kevin and whispered. &quot; Keep down, baby. There&#39;s a cop right next to us.&quot; If she hadn&#39;t done that, he would never have noticed the toddler sitting in the car beside her. The toddler that was not in a child&#39;s car seat. When the light turned green Marsha pulled away hoping that the cop hadn&#39;t noticed Kevin. Just as she thought that he hadn&#39;t, he turned his lights on. She pulled over and rolled down the window. She watched him walk up to her car. &quot; I know what your going to say. Her car seat was stolen this morning and I was on my way to buy her another one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; May I see your license, ma&#39;am. &quot;She handed him her license. He looked at it for a minute and handed it back. &quot; Ma&#39;am, it is very dangerous for her to ride without a child safety seat. Perhaps you should&#39;ve left her with a sitter while you went to buy one. What&#39;s her name?&quot;<br />
<br />
He had a note pad and a pen, so she thought that he was writing this down, so she started spelling his name out. &quot; K-E...&quot; He was actually writing down her license plate number so he knew which car to look for.<br />
<br />
The officer, not realizing that she was spelling, thought that she told him her daughter&#39;s name and cut her off. Not knowing that there was more. He said. &quot; Katie? Such a pretty name. It don&#39;t look good on a headstone, though. She&#39;s very pretty too. Look, I should write you a ticket... I don&#39;t want to fine you. I just want your daughter to be safe. There&#39;s a department store just up the street, I&#39;ll follow you. You go there and buy a car seat. I will be watching to see if you do. If you do, I won&#39;t write you a ticket, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Thank you officer, I will. Right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; All right. Have a nice and safe day.&quot; He said and turned and walked back to his car.<br />
<br />
Marsha, Still a little nervous from the encounter pulled back onto the road with the officer right behind her. As she drove to the store, she talked to Kevin. &quot; Now Kevin, There&#39;s some thing&#39;s that we are going to have to do until we can get you changed back. First off. From now on, your name is Katie. I am your mommy and you must call me mommy, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Because it would look strange if I called you Kevin and you called me Marsha. Look, it&#39;s only for a little while, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Okay... Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; You are a two year old girl. You will have to do the things that a two year old girl would do. You&#39;re going to have to appear to be a normal child, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I think tho.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Good. Let me do the talking and let me make up the details so we don&#39;t arouse suspicion. I&#39;m afraid that if anyone started poking around and too many things didn&#39;t add up, They might take you away from me and that would make it impossible for you to become my husband again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Okay. Maw... Mommy. I don&#39;t want to be a widdle giwl forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; You won&#39;t be a little girl forever. Even if you have to stay that way, you&#39;ll probably grow into a big girl, and eventually into a woman, and maybe even into a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Oh, dath duth gweat! I weewy want dat to happen.&quot; The child said with as much sarcasm as she could muster.<br />
<br />
Marsha just laughed at that. She pulled into a parking place and got her new daughter out of the car. She set her down on her feet as the officer drove by and waved. She took the girl&#39;s hand and began walking slowly toward the store. After a few minutes of walking at a child&#39;s pace, she picked her up and said. &quot; I forgot. It&#39;s much faster to just carry you.&quot; The child didn&#39;t reply. They went into the store and Marsha bought a car seat and a few other things. She bought bottles and disposable diapers and a pacifier just in case they were needed. She also bought a couple of outfits with pants, So that Kevin might feel a little more comfortable as Katie. She also bought a couple pairs of shoes and some toys that were a little old for Katie but that might better hold her attention. And a little pink and white bikini that she just couldn&#39;t resist. And a few other things that she knew Katie would need.<br />
<br />
After paying for her selections, she took them and Katie out to the car. She opened the box containing the car seat and strapped it in place, in the back seat. Then she strapped Katie into it. Then she got in herself and drove home.<br />
<br />
By the time she got home, Amy was already there and ran out to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot; Hi mom. Where&#39;s dad? And who&#39;s this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I&#39;ll explain everything in the house. Help me carry all this stuff in the house, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two older females carried everything into the house. Then Marsha went back out to the car and carried Katie in.<br />
<br />
&quot; Okay mom. What&#39;s going on?&quot; Amy said finally.<br />
<br />
&quot; All right. Sit down.&quot; Amy sat down on the couch next to Katie. Marsha continued. &quot; I know this is going to be hard to believe. I can hardly believe it my self, and I saw it happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; What mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Here it goes. Your father and I went to the other house to get it cleaned up to sell. I started cleaning the kitchen and he went to the attic to open some old trunks that were left there. About a half hour later I heard a loud bang, like someone falling. So I ran upstairs and found your father looking in a mirror. Only it didn&#39;t look like your father. He looked like a nine or ten year old girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I told you it was hard to believe. Now let me finish. While we watched, he got younger and younger, until he ended up looking like that.&quot; She concluded, gesturing toward the toddler sitting beside Amy.<br />
<br />
Startled that her mother would make up such a story, She said. &quot; Yeah right! Really mom, Where&#39;s dad&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie finally spoke up. &quot; Amy, I wish your mother wath tewwing a thtowy. I&#39;m weawy your dad. I don&#39;t know how it happened, but I tuwned into a widdle giwl.&quot; Seeing the confused look on Amy&#39;s face, Katie continued. &quot; I&#39;m sowwy. I can onwy tawk wike a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; What did she say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; She said. She wished that I was making it up and that she was really turned into a little girl. She also apologized for only being able to talk like a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; That reminds me. Amy help me bring in some diaries that I have in the trunk of the car. I think they might hold the key to this mess. Katie, you sit here and watch TV.&quot; Marsha turned the TV on and put on a children&#39;s program, Barney. They left Katie watching TV and they went to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot; Mom, Katie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Well we can&#39;t call her Kevin or dad. can we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; No I guess we can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the house, a very disappointed Katie sat watching TV. &quot; She could&#39;ve put da baww game on.&quot; She said to herself. As she continued to watch tv, she realized that she was actually enjoying it. &quot; Brudder, da wonger I thtay thith way da more chiwdish I become.&quot; She also noticed that it was getting harder to remember how to say big words. She was starting to get concerned.<br />
<br />
The other two finished carrying the diaries up to Marsha&#39;s bedroom. Amy came back down and went in the kitchen to make dinner. Katie toddled into the kitchen to see what Amy was doing. &#39; It sure took a long time and a lot of effort to do this.&#39; Katie thought. Amy turned around and almost tripped over Katie with a pot of hot water.<br />
<br />
&quot; Daddy! Watch out! I almost burned you.&quot; Amy exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Marsha had come into the room without anyone realizing it. She said. &quot; Katie, come here. Amy, you have to call her Katie. Until we find a way to make her a man again, she is what she appears to be, a little girl. That means that she is to be referred to as a little girl. She is, until further notice, your little sister. You must use female terms to describe her such as she, her, Katie, or sis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Even at home?&quot; Amy asked. She felt odd calling her father anything but dad, even if he didn&#39;t look or sound like her dad.<br />
<br />
&quot; Yes even at home. We can&#39;t risk slipping up. We have to keep her here with us. You must also treat her like a little girl at all times. Even at home. If your baby-sitting her for me you must treat her just like the other kids you&#39;ve sat with. Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Yes, mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Wait,&quot; Katie chimed in. &quot; I don&#39;t think I wike dith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Sorry dear. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to have to be. Deal with it.&quot; With that she took Katie&#39;s hand and led her upstairs to the spare room.<br />
<br />
When they entered Katie&#39;s eyes widened. For in it she saw a crib, all done in white with gold trim. &quot; M... mommy?&quot; She said with awe.<br />
<br />
&quot; It&#39;s your new bed. Do you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Why can&#39;t I thweep wiff you wike awways?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Because, pumpkin, it&#39;s not right for little girls to sleep in the same bed with their mommies. C&#39;mon lets get those clothes off and get you bathed and ready for bed while Amy&#39;s finishing up supper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; A baff? Mommy haven&#39;t you found out how to tuwn me back into a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; Oh honey, mommy&#39;s too tired tonight and I had to make sure that you were comfortable until I can find a way.&quot; She undressed Katie. When she was naked Marsha noticed the medallion and asked her where it came from. Katie told her that she found it in a trunk for Amy. Marsha took it off of her, and led her into the bathroom to a waiting tub of water and put her in. While Katie was in the tub, Amy came up to tell them that dinner was ready and she had to go to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Marsha said. &quot; Go ahead. We&#39;re all girls now.&quot;</p>
