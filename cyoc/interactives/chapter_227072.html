<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The smell of meat cooking on the grill was enticing to any Fury within the vicinity of Edward’s backyard. The anthro red fox fury found the summer months to be his favorite time of the year. A chance to be outside grilling chicken, hot dogs, steaks and burgers was a past time he relished with great zeal. No more greater example was the Fourth of July BBQ he loved to host. Ever since becoming furies, the event has become bigger with the family his daughter Allison and her friend Brittany have formed. With Allison living next door with her mate, it was a simple task to remove the back fence bordering their respective properties; this allowed for a large space to host a party followed by fireworks in the evening for the cubs and a more amorous evening for the adults.<br />
<br />
Both Allison and Jimmy were busy setting a large picnic table up with plates and the cold side dishes that they prepared while Edward was busy at the grill. His vulpine tail wagging happily as he checked the chicken and corn currently on the flame. The burger and hotdogs were next as they didn’t take long compared to the chicken. His mate Julian stepping out of the house to check on her mate followed by their son Adam, who had a hungry look as he saw the chicken. His feline maw drooling as he licks his lips eagerly to tear into the flesh.<br />
“No Adam,” Julian noticing their cub trying to get at the grille; “no food until everyone shows up.”<br />
The antho cougar cub pouted as his father quickly shut the lid and turns the dial down on the grill; reducing the lame to a low heat. “Did you make sure to get the extra propane tanks,” Edward wiping his paws on a nearby towel.<br />
“There in the garage,” Julian nodding; “are you going to fetch them? Because one of us needs to keep an eye on Adam.”<br />
“Fine,” Edward looking at his son and mussing up his fur with a rub from his hand paw; “no spoiling your appetite just yet.”<br />
“Hungry,” was all Adam said as he noticed his older sister and her mate at the large table.<br />
“Come,” Julian seeing her daughter; “lets torment Allison.”<br />
<br />
“Yay,” Adam happily dashing towards the female cougar; more eying the potato salad that was just put down than his older sister, Adam tries unsuccessfully to grab the bowl that was on the table.<br />
“Woah there tyke,” Allison stopping her brother from doing damage; “where’s the fire?”<br />
“He’s just hungry,” Julian responding; “saw dad cooking chicken and now has an appetite to eat a horse.”<br />
“No horse on the menu,” Allison chuckling; “but I’m sure dad will have a burger with your name on it later.”<br />
<br />
“Is Jimmy J.R still sleeping,” Jullian looking around to see if her grandcub is anywhere.<br />
“He came back from camp last night,” Allison nodding; Jimmy Michael Edward Proudhoof J.R was sent to a summer camp after school let out for the summer. Spending a few weeks with other cubs sleeping under the stars and learning more about nature. The hope was for the experience to get Jimmy to be more extroverted and possibly make friends. Alison wasn’t able to get much out of her son as he was practically half asleep when his father brought him home. The male cougar fury cub trudge upstairs to his room and quickly fell asleep soon after.<br />
“I don’t know if it was successful or not,” Alison sighing; “but at least Jimmy and I had a few weeks of peace.”<br />
“I wouldn’t call it peaceful,” Julian sniggering; “your father and I heard you and your mate rutting loudly for several nights. Almost as if you two were making another cub,” Julian looking at her daughter with bemusement mixed with concern.<br />
“We won’t know for a while if our efforts took,” Alison winking at her mother; “but not taking your heat suppression pills doesn’t guarantee instant heat cycle like some believe.”<br />
<br />
Inside the house, an exhausted cougar cub begins to stir from his slumber. Lying next to him was has his cat Dickens. A Siamese Seal-point with chocolate paws and vivid blue eyes; the moment Jimmy J.R. began to stir, Dickens also started to move. More out of irritation then excitement; the cat would prefer to snuggle and sleep the entire day away if the opportunity presented itself. However, Jimmy’s movement prevented this as the cat was forced to stretch before jumping off the bed just as Jimmy sat up. The five year old Fury still stank of camp fire and pine needles, so he trudged to the bathroom and stumbled into the shower. Turning on the tap, Jimmy sighs as the rapidly warming water begins to soak and mat his fur. Taking a bottle from a nearby ledge that he can reach, the anthro cougar cub put a nominal dollop of the shampoo/body wash designed for fur and starts working it in as he scrubs his head working his way down to legs. Jimmy J.R pauses as he reaches his fury balls and gently rubs then down along with his sheath; remembering what his father showed him on keeping his sensitive bits clean. Jimmy then finishes up with his legs before allowing the water to rinse off the shampoo. Before he turns off the shower , Jimmy relaxes his bladder and a stream of urine shoots forth from his penis peeking out of the sheath and splashing on the far end of the shower wall. Watching as the yellow liquid pools around the drain before disappearing down the pipes. He knows girls don’t pee like he does, he saw a few squatting over those floor style toilets at school and at camp to understand that the don’t have dicks. Still he wonders if they ever try to pee standing up and if it is possible without making a mess.<br />
<br />
Putting those curious thoughts from his mind, Jimmy shuts off the shower and steps out. His foot paws stepping on the bathmat as he grabs a towel and starts furiously drying his fur. Unable to cast magic just yet, the cub has to use a fabric object to dry himself.<br />
“I can’t wait until my runes grew in,” the cub looking at his wrists; “then I can dry myself with out towels.”<br />
Sighing as he feels he is sufficiently dry, Jimmy tosses the towel in a laundry hamper that will soon need emptying. Full of towels and wash clothes, he grabs the canvas lining and hauls it to the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“Ooooof,” Jimmy S.R. grunts as his son opens the bathroom and runs into a sack he was carrying.<br />
“Well look who decided to wake up,” the anthro stag-deer looking at his son just coming out of the bathroom; “had a good nap?”<br />
“What time did we get home last night,” Jimmy J.R. asking.<br />
“Around midnight,” Jimmy S.R answering; “those dirty towels?”<br />
“Yeah,” the cub responding; “taking them to the washing machine.”<br />
“I’ll do that,” the anthro stag-deer answering; “you get yourself a bite to eat. But not too much. You got your grandfather’s BBQ to look forward to tonight.”<br />
<br />
***************<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Edward placing two propane tanks by the back door; far enough to not run the risk of exploding from a stray ember from the BBQ grille but close enough to ensure that swapping out an empty for a full won’t lose precious heat or grilling time. “Now we wait for the rest of the party guest to arrive.<br />
“Brittany and Jake are on their way,” Alison approaching and giving her father a hug; “Dusk and dawn as well.”<br />
“I’m certain those two have been told to behave,” Edward getting caught up with the antics of the fraternal twins that Brittany gave birth too. Having to go to school with half of their fur died pink as a punishment for a poorly planned prank; and ideal Brittany got after the two tried to harm Jimmy J.R.’s cat Dickens. Allison made those two endure a full body dye job as she had little patience for acts of animal cruelty.<br />
“They have to spend their entire summer break helping the custodian clean and prep the school for the upcoming term,” Alison cackling; “serves those two right for trying to blow up a garbage container.<br />
<br />
“Our son is finally awake and munching on some toast,” Jimmy S.R stepping out into the back yard. The anthro stag-deer seeing his mate with her parent’s by the BBQ and approaching them. He notices Julian keeping a tight rein on Adam as the cub is still trying to wrestle his way to the waiting food at the picnic table.<br />
“Dad and Denise are on their way,” Jimmy S.R. putting his phone away; “Roxy sounds excited because she is bouncing all over the place eager for fireworks.”<br />
“Tonight shall not disappoint,” Edward chuckling; “Julian did Lucas and Rachael give word if they are on their way?”<br />
“In about twenty minutes,” the cougar fury checking her phone; “they will need help as Oliver and Paul are still in high chairs and will need help setting up an area that they can play safely in.”<br />
“The youngest of our family,” Edward laughing; “I better check the chicken and get the burgers and hotdogs going. Adam why don’t you visit your nephew Jimmy J.R,” Edward is looking at his son; “but don’t torment his cat, less you want to end up like Dusk and Dawn.”</p>
