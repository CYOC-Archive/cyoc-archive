<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After making sure her stepmother was nowhere around, Jamie went to her father&#39;s workshop and frowned.  Did she have to repeat the incantation, or could she just call Gemory&#39;s name?<br />
<br />
“Um, Gemory, are you busy?”<br />
<br />
There was a flash of light, and two small figures appeared.  The first looked like Gemory, but much younger, which, combined with her already tiny size, made her look probably even younger (but Jamie guess she was about 9 or 10).<br />
<br />
There was a second girl with her, also blonde, with green eyes.  She was about the same age, maybe a little older.  Still quite pretty, but not quite in the same class as the demon.<br />
<br />
They were both quite adorable.<br />
<br />
Jamie noted the other girl had a ring identical to Gemory&#39;s on her finger.  -This- was Gemory&#39;s fiancee?  A kid?<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d show up so fast...um...why are you..?”<br />
<br />
Gemory rolled her eyes.  “Workplace accident.  It&#39;s a long story.”<br />
<br />
“Oofta, so Toni is a &#39;workplace accident&#39;?  She doesn&#39;t even work for you.”  The other girl spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Anyways, it&#39;s only temporary.”  Gemory continued.  “Jamie, meet Danielle.  Apparently it&#39;s &#39;bring your fiancee to work&#39; night.”<br />
<br />
Danielle waved.  “Sorry, I just wanted to know what Gem was up to.”<br />
<br />
“So you&#39;re not normally a little girl?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
“Nope, I&#39;m actually 17.”  Danielle replied.  “Not sure if that&#39;s any less creepy, since my fiancee here is like a million years old.”<br />
<br />
“Oh now you&#39;re cracking jokes about my age?”  Gemory tried to glare, but couldn&#39;t.  “You&#39;re lucky I love you.”<br />
<br />
“Um, well, anyways, it&#39;s good to meet you, Danielle.”  Jamie smiled nervously.<br />
<br />
“Likewise, Jamie.  So what is Gem doing for you, exactly?” Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
Jamie quickly recounted her story.  Danielle&#39;s reaction was more subdued than Gemory&#39;s, but only because she couldn&#39;t make her eyes light on fire.  “Oh she&#39;s a right bitch, yah?  I hope you made her suffer.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s...a little more complicated than I thought.”  Jamie then told the rest of her story.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not surprised.  Hatred like that doesn&#39;t come from nowhere.  Hate and love are often more complex and intertwined than people realize.  So do you love her, Jamie?”  Gemory tilted her head to one side, as if thoughtful.<br />
<br />
“I...I don&#39;t know.  Maybe a little?  I don&#39;t hate her anymore, at least, not this version of her.  Which makes this complicated, because now she&#39;s going to be bullied.  And...”  Jamie frowned, not sure how to put her feelings into words.<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s yours, and only you get to punish her?”  Danielle guessed.<br />
<br />
Jamie blushed.  “Basically.”<br />
<br />
“Well, giving her the ability to defend herself...and you, for that matter, will go a long way.  But I was in a hurry before, I should have given the ring a normalization feature.”  Gemory said.<br />
<br />
“A what now?”  Jamie blinked.  She was a smart girl, but somehow, Gemory kept confusing her.  It was like the demon was thinking several steps ahead at all times, like a Chess grandmaster.<br />
<br />
“So let&#39;s say you decided, I don&#39;t know, to punish your slave by giving her tiny breasts.”  Gemory shot Danielle a glare for some reason.<br />
<br />
The other girl just shrugged and smiled.<br />
<br />
Gemory continued.  “Obviously, that&#39;s the kind of thing that people will notice and comment on.  Which could draw attention to the ring, or you.  So, as an after-market feature, I can make it so that people are more likely to accept changes you make with the ring.  It&#39;s not foolproof or instantaneous, but over time, things will settle down.”<br />
<br />
“Somebody else&#39;s problem, basically.”  Danielle chimed in.<br />
<br />
Jamie had heard that term before.  “Oh, like in the Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy?  People see it, but they just go &#39;eh, not my problem&#39;, and ignore it?”<br />
<br />
“Not exactly, but it&#39;s a close enough analogy.”  Gemory shrugged.<br />
<br />
“So how much will this cost me?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
“Now you&#39;re learning.  You were so upset last time, you agreed straight away.”  Gemory smiled.<br />
<br />
“You didn&#39;t take advantage of her, did you, Gem?”  Danielle folded her arms.<br />
<br />
“What, no!  She was distraught!  Even Amielle would agree that Kelly had gone too far.”  Gemory defended herself.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t feel taken advantage of, Danielle.  I mean, I get it, I&#39;m going to Hell when I die, but Gemory says it won&#39;t be so bad.”  Jamie interjected.<br />
<br />
“Seems unfair to go to Hell over something like this, if you ask me.”  Danielle grumbled.  “But, yes, if I have anything to say about it, you&#39;ll be treated well.”<br />
<br />
“She can do that to, once we&#39;re married, she&#39;ll be a Duchess of Hell.”  Gemory looked at her fiancee with love in her eyes.  “As I recall, we discussed you working for me on Earth.  So here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do.  College- what will your major be?”<br />
<br />
“I want to be a software designer.”  Jamie admitted.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes, I can put those skills to use.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
“More like softcore designer.”  Danielle muttered.<br />
<br />
“And what of it?  Imagine it, if you will.   An MMO with a cute mascot like Toni, full of beautiful girls.  I mean, have you seen some of those asian MMO&#39;s?  And a core mechanic will be to make deals with the ultimate waifu!”  Gemory seemed pleased with herself.<br />
<br />
“The Demon Gemory?”  Danielle guessed.<br />
<br />
“Who else?”  Gemory nodded.<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s just one problem with that.”  Danielle reached over and grabbed Gemory by the ear.<br />
<br />
“Ow, hey!  What&#39;s that?!”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re -my- waifu!”  Danielle then kissed Gemory.  It was a very adult kiss.<br />
<br />
Jamie was strangely aroused, despite the fact the two looked like children.  But she also felt like she was intruding.  “Uh...I can go...”<br />
<br />
Gemory seemed a little dazed by the kiss.  “Wow...uh, no, no, sorry about that, Jamie.”  She playfully batted Danielle away.  “Not in front of the customers!”<br />
<br />
Danielle giggled.  “Man it&#39;s awesome seeing you on the back foot.  I bet it doesn&#39;t happen often.”<br />
<br />
“It didn&#39;t used to...anyways, here&#39;s the deal.  Once you graduate, you&#39;ll work for my company, and we can put your skills to work for Hell.  Great pay and benefits, you won&#39;t be sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Making a computer program that leads people to sell their souls?”  Jamie frowned.<br />
<br />
“Not just any people, Jamie.  People who probably deserve to be there.  And people like you, who fall through the cracks.  You&#39;re a good person that was pushed too far.  Heaven would have had you just endure it.  But no one should have to suffer abuse like that.  So in the end, wasn&#39;t it better that you were led to me?”  Gemory asked.<br />
<br />
“...the person who told me how to contact you, they work for you, don&#39;t they?”  Jamie realized.<br />
<br />
“Probably, yes.  But my agents have been slow to adapt to social media and modern technology.  You could change that.  Imagine a computer program that could summon me or my agents without messy rituals and chalk circles on the floor!”  Gemory&#39;s eyes lit up, but this time the fire was cheery and warm.<br />
<br />
“It would be more convenient.  Well.  I mean, I guess I shouldn&#39;t worry about leading people to Hell at this point.”  Jamie conceded.<br />
<br />
“In for a penny, in for a pound.”  Danielle nodded.<br />
<br />
“Fine, I agree.” Jamie held out her hand.<br />
<br />
Gemory shook it, then kissed the back of Jamie&#39;s hand.  For a brief instant, Jamie saw a strange glyph appear on her hand, then fade.<br />
<br />
“What was that?!”  Jamie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s her Mark.  If you run into demons, angels, whatever, they&#39;ll know you&#39;re her property, and not to mess with you.”  Danielle expained.  “Hey, how come you just kissed her to place your Mark on her, and you bit me?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I like biting you.  But also, your Mark is special, my love.  You&#39;re not my servant or my property.  You&#39;re under my fullest protection.”  The demon explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Well for that, you deserve a reward.”  Danielle smiled softly, then looked up to Jamie.  “You see, it&#39;s very important to keep demons disciplined, I&#39;ve found.  They can get up to a lot of mischief or even cruelty.  So when they are bad, you have to punish them.  And if they are goo...not as bad, you reward them.”<br />
<br />
“Oh you can say &#39;good&#39;, that&#39;s not going to make me break out in hives.”  Gemory waved that off.<br />
<br />
“Uh.  What do you do if someone -likes- being punished?”  Jamie asked, blushing.  “Kelly seems to...get off on it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that&#39;s fun!  Well, then you have to learn when to withhold punishments.  Obviously, it&#39;s alright if she&#39;s a little naughty- she wants you to punish her for it.  But if she&#39;s really bad...”  <br />
<br />
“Silent treatment.  Cold shoulder.”  Danielle broke in.<br />
<br />
“Yes, those work perfectly.”  Gemory nodded.<br />
<br />
Jamie thought about earlier, when she had been angry with Kelly, and the way Kelly had reacted.  “I think I get it.  Thank you, both of you.”<br />
<br />
“No problem, Jamie.  I&#39;m happy to help.”  Gemory curtsied.<br />
<br />
“Also, you seem like good people, maybe we can meet up sometime?  Pretty much all my friends are demons and angels anymore.”  Danielle offered.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Sure, that sounds great...all my friends are online.”  Jamie admitted.<br />
<br />
Danielle walked up and gave the older girl a hug.  “Not anymore.”<br />
<br />
<br />
After Gemory returned them to the Kingsley House, Danielle sat down on their bed.  “Hey, thanks for letting me tag along.”<br />
<br />
“Suspicious that I was getting up to no good while I was out of sight, love?”<br />
<br />
“A little”, Danielle admitted.  “I know I should trust you, but you -are- evil, right?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m not offended.  Honestly, I think you&#39;ve been having a good influence on me.  I treated her more gently than I would have in the past.  Though some would say I&#39;m being soft.”  She shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Well, I do want to hear about your plans for her stepmom, but for now...”  Danielle patted the bed.  “You&#39;ve earned yourself a good cuddling session.”<br />
<br />
Gemory smiled.  “You know, I thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to wait until you grew up again, but it turns out...I like cuddling.”<br />
<br />
“Doesn&#39;t surprise me, Gem.  Back when you were an angel, you went straight from no sex to all the sex.  Everything else is just foreplay.  The idea of gaining happiness from simple intimacy is a whole new ballgame.”<br />
<br />
Gemory blinked, as she realized there was a whole untapped market for souls she, nor perhaps no Fallen, had ever considered!  “Hold that thought, I need to make a text real quick.”<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to being the Mistress of her Harem, Minuet the Erodaemon was in charge of choosing and transforming captured souls into Succubi.  When her cell phone alerted her, she lazily reached over with one arm and looked at it.<br />
<br />
“Min, just had a thought.  Some mortals require intimacy and physical affection as much or even more than sex.  So what do you think about selecting recruits to become cute, adorable Succubi?  Real lolita types?”<br />
<br />
Minuet blinked, considering the idea.  Yes, perhaps there was merit in such an experiment.  “It would require souls that still retain some level of purity- a rare commodity.  But I&#39;ll do my best, my Duke.”<br />
<br />
She was surprised when her Master replied with smiley face and heart emojis.  Perhaps what Belzazel had to say about Gemory&#39;s behavior had been correct.  Her Master was changing.<br />
<br />
“Fascinating.”  She smiled, as she realized she&#39;d been getting bored.  This was going to be interesting!<br />
<br />
But before she got to work, her mutated body had needs- a nearly uncontrollable lust that kept her brilliant intellect in check.  She called over a trio of attractive servants.  “Attend me”, she said, rolling to lay on her side on her small mountain of cushions.<br />
<br />
As two demons fondled and sucked on her breasts, the third began to eat out her pussy.  Her desires being catered to, her brain was free to work...</p>
