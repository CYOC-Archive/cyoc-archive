<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trio of newly changed werewolves didn't seem to notice me. Arnold's father and <br />
mother were licking at each other, and Arnold seemed himself to be rather enamored with his new shape. They <br />
rose to a more standard two-legged stance, and glanced at me for a second, then sniffed at the air and climbed <br />
the fence that surrounded their yard, leaving me alone. A minute or so later, I could hear the sound of <br />
breaking glass at a neighbor's house, then the sounds of a family screaming. I probably should have been <br />
worried, but my mind was on other things, particularly the raging hardon in my pants. It's one thing to <br />
fantasize about werewolves existing, or fantasizing about seeing a transformation-it's a whole other thing to <br />
actually have that right at your fingertips.<br />
<br />
                        &quot;I wish Arnold's sister would come out here and shift..and willingly let me have my <br />
way with her,&quot; I said, knowing full well the power that I had acquired. Sure enough, Arnold's sister Kyra <br />
appeared at their back door, clad in a black silk robe. She opened the door in mild confusion. She was a leggy <br />
thing, two years older than Arnold. She had big blue eyes and mid sized tits, and her dark brown hair hung <br />
just past her shoulders.<br />
<br />
                        &quot;Joe?&quot; she said quietly as she slowly walked out into the backyard.<br />
<br />
                        &quot;Yup,&quot; I said. &quot;Hey Kyra, what's up?&quot; I was deliberately stalling, wanting her to get <br />
out into the yard where I was, where she could have a nice view of the full moon.<br />
<br />
                        &quot;I thought I heard something outside,&quot; she said, walking up to me without hesitation. <br />
Whether it was the wish I'd made or just her general trusting nature, I don't know. &quot;I'm assuming my brother's <br />
somewhere around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
                        &quot;Actually, he and your parents just ran off,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
                        &quot;Well, it IS a full moon,&quot; she said knowingly. I coughed slightly in surprise. &quot;That's <br />
right, Joe..I know what I am..and what the world will become..&quot; she smirked at me, staring up at the sky.<br />
<br />
                        &quot;Uhh..really?&quot; I asked. &quot;I kind of thought this was a new thing, at least it was for <br />
the rest of your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
                        &quot;Didn't you see the news? We've been around, just not openly. I actually got brought <br />
into the pack by my sorority a few months ago. Though I guess for them it's a bit new,&quot; she smiled again, and <br />
leaned in, sniffing my neck. &quot;And yes, you dirty boy..it DID happen with hot lesbian werewolf sex. When the <br />
moon's full, we get rather...insatiable, and the lines of sexuality get rather..blurred.&quot; She was panting <br />
slightly, and her skin had a fine sheen of sweat building on it.<br />
<br />
                       I realized that just like the rest of the &quot;other werewolves&quot; that had sprung up, <br />
reality was trying to cope with my wish. While Kyra was behaving exactly (so far) within what I'd wished, the <br />
universe was trying to give her a rationale for her behavior. It's amazing how adaptable existence as a whole <br />
was proving to be. <br />
<br />
                       &quot;I can smell the sweet scent of lust on your skin, Joe. I can see the bulge in your <br />
jeans too,&quot; she said, nipping my earlobe lightly as she whispered, and she slipped her hand between my legs <br />
and rubbed the denim seductively. &quot;Since you have neither a trace of fear in your scent, and you haven't <br />
pushed me away yet, despite knowing what I am..the only conclusion I can draw is that you're turned on by what <br />
I am.&quot; She growled softly into my ear. &quot;Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
                       &quot;Y.yeah,&quot; I stammered as she continued to stroke my bulge. &quot;So..why aren't you shifting <br />
like everyone else?&quot;<br />
<br />
                       &quot;Because this isn't my first moonrise, silly boy. The longer you're a werewolf, the <br />
more you can control it..though I already can feel my control slipping. My pussy is BOILING right now,&quot; she <br />
told me, slipping a leg around me and grinding herself lightly on my hip. I could feel her juices soaking my <br />
pants. &quot;You can't see it, but I'm already shifting, albeit on a molecular level. Soon though, I'll reach that <br />
tipping point, the point of no return..and..&quot; she shuddered hard as a tremor went through her and she ground <br />
herself harder against me. &quot;It feels soooo goood..&quot; she moaned softly. She reached down and undid the belt of <br />
her robe, letting it fall open, and then off.<br />
<br />
                       Her body was beyond what I'd fantasized about, and her pale skin positively shone in <br />
the moonlight. Her hard nipples stood rigidly out from her firm and perky high-c cup breasts, and she rubbed <br />
me firmly, her left hand against my bulge and the right stroking my back. &quot;Do you want me, Joey?&quot; her voice <br />
had a slightly deeper and more husky tone.<br />
<br />
                      &quot;Absolutely,&quot; I said, unashamed of my fetish for one of the few times in my life. I'd <br />
come clean with a few people, but always worried about being judged. Not this time, though.<br />
<br />
                      &quot;Do you want the beast as well?&quot; she asked, gripping the front of my shirt and pulling <br />
at it, tugging me toward her and giving me a rough kiss. Her skin was blazing hot, and her eyes had started to <br />
yellow. &quot;Do you want to fuck me, Joey?&quot; Another rough kiss. Her eyes were bright yellow now. &quot;Do you want to <br />
stick your cock in me while I shift, Joey?&quot; Another rough kiss, and now I could feel her claws starting to <br />
extend, and she tore off my shirt.<br />
<br />
                      I licked the side of her neck, then gave it a sharp nip. &quot;I'm going to make you my bitch <br />
tonight, Kyra,&quot; I said, even growling a little. &quot;Just like I've wanted to since I was 14.&quot;<br />
<br />
                      Kyra dropped to all fours with a smile, raising her ass in the air to me. &quot;Enough talk,&quot; <br />
she said, focusing her eyes on the moon. &quot;It..it's time..forrrrrrr...the rrrrrrruutttt...&quot; Her spine started <br />
to pop, and brown fur slowly started to sprout along her back. I didn't have to be told twice, as I dropped my <br />
pants and quickly entered her. There was no delicacy about what we were doing; I gave it to her as hard and <br />
fast as I could muster. I pulled her hair and reached under her, fondling her dangling tits as fur grew from <br />
her every pore and her body stretched and grew more massive under the thrall of the moon.<br />
                       <br />
                       The backyard was filled with the sounds of hard fucking, muscle warping, and bones <br />
popping, along with the sounds of my human moans, and her inhuman growls and snarls. The sensation of her <br />
vagina shifting was unlike anything I could have imagined; it clamped and unclamped tightly around me in the <br />
rhythm of our fucking and her transformation. Every bit of what she was slowly was enveloped by an equally <br />
beautiful bestial form, quite visibly female from head to toe. Her climax was a loud howl, loud enough to send <br />
a flock of birds that had been roosting in one of the trees to flight. I erupted in her and pulled out, almost <br />
too weak to stand.<br />
<br />
And then..</p>
