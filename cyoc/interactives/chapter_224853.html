<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the years, I got used to being a trophy. I went to college and majored in jockology, a new field of science dedicated to studying how jock season worked. It wasn&#39;t magic. It couldn&#39;t have been magic. Magic didn&#39;t exist. But science couldn&#39;t explain it either.<br />
<br />
I performed a dual role in the research. I was both a researcher and one of the guinea pigs since I was only twenty four and still legally a jock. My colleagues and I made great progress in learning how to trigger transformations. It was strange how much of a role the law and ownership played in the process. No one could ever transform me unless there was some written law or contract establishing temporary ownership of me. I got used to working naked.<br />
<br />
Pete had graduated with a degree in jockology and now worked as our teacher in jockology. He often played with me while he taught class. Often he would demonstrate on me as he taught but even if it had nothing to do with the class, he would play with me. Sometimes, he would turn me into my own cock and pass me around the room. It was hard to keep listening to the teacher while I was being played with but I got used to it. I was a trophy. If I didn&#39;t have any other plans, Pete would often leave me as my own cock sitting on his desk for whoever came by.<br />
<br />
The janitor laughed whenever he discovered me. He picked me up and shoved me in his pocket. Then when he got back to the janitor&#39;s closet, he washed me in the sink like the object I was. I often shot my load into the sink. He&#39;d then return me to Pete&#39;s desk. I wished he&#39;d played with me more.<br />
<br />
Pete also often took me with him which meant getting played with by Billy, Matt, Russ or any of Pete&#39;s other friends and colleagues. Then I&#39;d often be transformed into my own ass for their use. I also attended teacher&#39;s conferences where I would be passed around by the university staff.<br />
<br />
This only became a problem if the conference ran longer than my contract. Whenever the time of the contract ended, I would become human again and whoever was playing with me would get so mad. As long as I was a trophy, no one had any problem but if I turned human, they called me a pervert and blamed me. Then I would have to figure out how to get back to my clothes. Often I wrote up a quick contract so Pete could own me long enough to get me back to my clothes. Pete was always such a good guy about that.<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time as a trophy. I didn&#39;t just contract myself out to Mr. Ferguson. There were lots of people who wanted to own me for an hour or so. I became a city wide celebrity. When film makers made films in which they needed a trophy like me, I was the first one they&#39;d call. Dan was very upset about this. He thought he should be the one being filmed since he was the most sought after trophy which he still was considered the best trophy ever. But he turned twenty six and could no longer be hunted. Besides, for film purposes, my nine inch rack was more desirable. Many films made a point of making a scene where my rack got measured for the entire audience to see.<br />
<br />
Fans wanted my autograph or to take pictures with me. I obliged them by stripping down and posing as their trophy. It seemed to be everybody&#39;s favorite as well as my own to pose with them holding my cock up to show how big I was. The entire city knew me. They would often give me free coffee or bagels or other treats just for showing them my famous nine inch rack. Life was good.<br />
<br />
But it did have it&#39;s down side. Some people were more interested in my ass than in my cock. Sometimes I&#39;d oblige them but I usually required a contract. I didn&#39;t expect much. It wasn&#39;t so much about the money. I just felt like they needed to earn my ass. I didn&#39;t want to just give it away. Mr. Ferguson, Mr. Corcoran, my dad and others continued to train me to be a better jock so they could use my ass whenever, even if I wasn&#39;t under contract. My dad didn&#39;t use my ass often. He tried to date and build relationships but if he felt frustrated, I had to drop my pants. There was even one morning when he plowed me while I ate breakfast, right there while Jase watched.<br />
<br />
Another downside was that between college, time as a trophy and time training to be a better jock, I didn&#39;t have much time for anything else. I reestablished my friendship with Jared and I grew a friendship with Lucas but they too were often too busy being trophies or training to hang out. I made two new friend, Mark and Sam, who did have more time to hang out or they would accompany me to support my training without expecting anything in return. They just enjoyed being with me.<br />
<br />
Of course even with them, I couldn&#39;t escape being a trophy. During training, they would support me by playing the role of hunters sometimes and if they caught me, they used me. If the five of us; Jared, Lucas, Mark, Sam and I went to the movies, we just expected Mark and Sam to play with our cocks during the movie. Or after we went swimming, while I showered, it was normal for Sam or Mark to sneak into the shower with me and plow my ass. Sometimes, I got both their dicks inside me at the same time. But what could I do? I was a trophy and they were my friends.<br />
<br />
I also managed to get married and have a son. My son was only four at the time. I tried to keep the entire jock season trophy business out of his life. I wasn&#39;t sure he could understand that his dad spent a lot of time as a trophy. But it was impossible to keep it a secret, especially when fans wanted pictures while I was with my wife and son. There were a few times when my wife picked me up from college and Pete had left me as nothing but my cock until the contract ran out. My wife would drop me in her purse to carry me home hidden from our son. The contract always ran out before she could play with me but one time, my son found me while I was still in cock form and he took me outside to show me to his friends. They played with me for hours pretending I was a car that they drove through the sandbox. Then my contract ended and I suddenly became a naked human right there in the sandbox. After I got dressed, I had to explain to him about how I was the cock he was playing with but he already knew. His friends had all told him about how I was one of the most sought after trophies in the business.<br />
<br />
After that, I became more relaxed about it. I reminded him that I was still his father but I let him hang out with me at college while the other guys experimented on me. I went ahead and posed naked for fans in front of him. When he saw me in movies or tv shows, I let him know that yes, that&#39;s me. He then complained that I let other people play with my cock and he wanted to play with my cock too. So I had to give him some time to treat me like a toy. He still didn&#39;t understand cocks and treated me in my cock form the same way he treated his toy cars. I knew one day he would want to show me off in show and tell.<br />
<br />
But the worst thing was how little I saw Nick. Despite all the contracts giving ownership of me to others, I always felt that Nick was my real owner. I became a great jock, able to avoid being captured by anyone until Nick showed up. I never made it easy on Nick but I was less motivated to avoid him and so year after year, he caught me and I became Nick&#39;s trophy again. I watched him and Jase grow up and become men. I felt his sexual development as he played with me and used me year after year. Jase grew a nine inch cock just like mine. Nick, wanting to be a jock like me, got permission from Mr. Corcoran to get treatments until Nick had a ten inch cock, bigger than mine. I felt like I was where I belonged when I had both their cocks inside me. But outside of jock season, I rarely saw Nick.</p>
