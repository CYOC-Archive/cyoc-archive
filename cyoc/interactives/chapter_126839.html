<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The band of bro&#39;s laugh and crack their knuckles to get ready for a fight but then they suddenly go quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what the Hell, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with his eyes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is too weird. Let&#39;s get out of here!&quot; They all back off and trip over themselves trying run away from us. From Johnny.<br />
<br />
I squeeze his hand. &quot;Baby are you all right?&quot; This time he turns to me, keeping his face hidden, and starts breathing really hard. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have come.&quot; He presses his hands against his head and grits his teeth. &quot;Come on its not so bad. &quot;<br />
<br />
I try to relax him, but his breathing doesn&#39;t slow down.&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to find out this way.&quot; He lifts head to me but keeps his eyes closed. &quot;Find out what? Are you sick?&quot;<br />
<br />
He opens his eyes. &quot;Kind of.&quot; His red eyes.<br />
<br />
Not just bloodshot. His brown eyes have turned into a glowing bright red, the same color as blood. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will explain but please get me out of here.&quot; He lifts up his hands to show me his finger nails... no, claws growing very long. &quot;Please Megan&quot; he begs with a frown. Were those fangs?<br />
<br />
Obviously something is very wrong here. &quot;Okay. Keep your head down and follow me.&quot; I grab him by his wrist, avoiding those sharp claws, and lead him through the crowded food court. Nobody seems to notice anything but we move quickly. I push open the large double doors and we are standing out in the cooler parking lot. He felt so hot maybe the winter breeze would cool him off. &quot;Does this help?&quot; His claws stop growing but his eyes are still glowing red. Not to mention his large fangs are still there.<br />
<br />
&quot;No there are...&quot; He grunts hard and falls to his knees, clutching his stomach. Mall goers passing by look at us concerned but I brush them off. &quot;So sorry everyone,&quot; I lie. &quot;He just got a really bad phone call. Is mother is very sick.&quot; They frown and shake their heads in pity and go on with their business. I focus back on my boyfriend. &quot;What is it? What&#39;s happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too... many... people&quot; He says in between breaths. His flannel shirt starts to tear as his back grows. Holy shit, what did this wish get me into?<br />
<br />
Obviously we have to get out of here but my mom dropped us off. How are we supposed to...oh yeah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Book!&quot; My magic book comes flying through the glass double door, shattering it, and opens itself to fresh page. The pen soon follows and clicks itself ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that I had my own car and knew how to drive it.&quot; The pen swirls the last swirl and the letters turn gold as my wish comes true. Gold dust flies off the page and floats over to the curb closest to us. The magic gold dust cloud grows and grows until it takes the shape of a sedan and twinkles away. Now in its place is a shimmering gold car and both doors pop open. A pair of keys appears in my hand and I help Johnny into the passenger seat. I toss the book and pen in the back seat and we drive off.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know where we are going but I needed to get him out of there. I try to cool him down by opening the windows and turning in the A/C but I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s working. His forearms are covered in hair and his face is starting to look more beastly. He barely even fits in the seat with how large he has grown. I drive us to the outskirts of town where no one would be around to see anything weird.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off your flannel maybe it&#39;ll help cool you down.&quot; I pull over into an abandoned fast food parking lot to give him some space. He tries to pull the shirt over his head but ends just ripping through both the flannel and his t shirt with his claws. Frustrated with his own hands he tosses the shreds of his shirts out the window leaving my big hairy man topless. I don&#39;t even get a chance to check out his huge body properly because I&#39;m so worried about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sor... sorry Meg-an.&quot; He tries to talk but his mouth is full of dangerously sharp teeth. I&#39;m freaking out too but I need him to stay calm before he accidentally shreds me. But he hears how his own voice sounds and gets out of the car to get room and kneel on the ground. I get out and kneel next to him holding his hand in mine. &quot;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s going to be okay baby. I love you.&quot; His grunting slows and he looks at me with those scary red eyes. I don&#39;t look away and put my hand on his cheek. His jaw is much bigger and covered in hair but I try not to show how much I&#39;m scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love me?&quot; His hair starts to fade away under my touch but I don&#39;t say anything. &quot;I do Johnny. I&#39;m here.&quot; I kiss him on his wolf-like nose and his red eyes flicker until the turn back into his normal brown. He smiles at me and kisses my forehead before backing away to get some room. Johnny manages to slow down his breathing and starts to transform back. His body hair starts to recede back into his body. Johnny&#39;s arms and back shrink down to his &quot;regular&quot; size as his face slowly loses its wild deformed edges. He keeps changing until he is left laying shirtless on the asphalt, as muscular and hairy as the wish initially made him. Johnny was back.<br />
<br />
I watch over to my boyfriend as he slowly starts to get up from his transformation. I&#39;m happy he&#39;s okay but I want answers. Instead of waiting for him, I go and sit in the back seat of my car, sliding over to other side and keeping the door open so he knows to get in after me. Johnny manages to get up and wipes the dirt off his jeans before getting in the car and closing the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice car. When did you get it?&quot; I wished for it duh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesterday. I saved up.&quot; I guess he doems&#39;t know about the book anymore. &quot;But that&#39;s not I want to talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So now you know my secret. I didn&#39;t want to you find out this way, to see me almost lose control...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Johnny before you go on, I need to know. I need to hear you say it: what are you exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
He sits quietly for a moment, as if saying makes what just happened real. &quot;I am a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well there it is. He said it. This really happened. How did the book know about my love for YA novels? It really took liberties with this wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t always like this though. It all happened this summer.&quot; So even as Johnny, Jenny had a very transformative summer vacation.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened Johnny?&quot;<br />
<br />
He lifts a massive arm to scratch the back of his head nervously. &quot;You know how I went to visit my Uncle Brett and Aunt Gina&#39;s house up in the mountains?&quot; So he went away this summer just like Jenny, interesting. I nod, signaling him to keep going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was out fishing at a creek near the house when I attacked. My uncle heard it howl from the house and came to get me. I only had a few scratches and one giant bite mark on my side under my left arm. Uncle Brett thought it was some lone wolf but I found out later it really wasn&#39;t. He took me back to their house and Aunt Gina stitched me up and put me to bed. But as soon as I laid down I broke out into a fever. Nothing would cool me down and eventually I fell asleep. I slept for 2 weeks straight, only opening my eyes a few times when Aunt Gina would change my blankets out. They had a doctor stop by the house to check on me but he didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
2 whole weeks in a fever coma? Whoa. Turning into a werewolf must&#39;ve almost killed him. &quot;Then what happened Johnny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then one day, my fever broke, I woke up, and I looked like this.&quot; He gestures to his large hairy chest. &quot;I think being sick like that was just body changing into a werewolf. And my human body had to change too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like your new body.&quot; I move closer to his side of the car and snuggle up under his arm. He&#39;s shocked but puts his arm around me. &quot;I could tell. When I came back home, everybody couldn&#39;t believe how much I changed. But you liked it. You liked it alot. You even did your own changing this summer too.&quot; His hand moves from the small of my back to rest on my ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true. But I&#39;m no werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a fox.&quot; He leans in and kisses me over my smile. I kiss him back and we make out in the back of my car. Johnny starts to get a little rough but it&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t like. He is much better at kissing then Jenny. After a few minutes he pushes me back into the seat and climbs over my body. I don&#39;t notice his eyes flickering red as he undoes his pants and pulls out his heavy artillery I spotted earlier. In a flash, without even saying a word past a low growl, Johnny flips me over so my big booty is up in the air and fucks me. Hard.<br />
<br />
I scream out in pain at having his 14 inch dick shoved inside me but he starts kissing my back. This time I notice the light scratching of fangs against my skin. &quot;Johnny?&quot; But he doesn&#39;t hear me. Sensing me tighten around him, his starts driving himself deeper into me while grabbing my ass. He&#39;s being very forceful this time but I like it. He slaps my ass a few times, his claws leaving small scratches behind.<br />
<br />
He goes faster and faster until with a loud howl, he releases inside of me. Once it&#39;s over he slowly kisses all over my body and pulls my skirt back down. He puts himself back into his pants and we snuggle in the back of my car for a few hours before I drive us back into town.<br />
<br />
I never thought I would have a werewolf boyfriend. But this is great. The magic book really knows how to treat a girl right?</p>
