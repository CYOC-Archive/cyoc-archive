<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How about a hamster?” Jeff said, surprising himself a little. “Dogs are fantastic, but if I am going to be a pet animal for a few hours, maybe I should try a bigger change”<br />
<br />
Sally looked at you in surprise. “A hamster??”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Jeff says, confidence faltering a little more. “It’s going to be a whole new perspective to see the world. To be full of energy to see it. And we had one before you. My first pet Hammy. He always seemed to have a great time when we let him run around the house”<br />
<br />
As you were talking her eyes widened further. “You are going to be adorable! It’s an excellent idea!” Her voice growing into a smile. “I can look after you this evening just like you did for Hammy. We’re going to have a lot of fun in our roles. I can already tell”.<br />
<br />
Jeff relaxes a little. She hadn’t found his choice too strange, she seemed to like it. And after all her years as his loyal pet, he felt he could trust trust her? She was still Sally, right? Just in human and, hard to deny it… attractive female form. Jeff shook his head. He’d need to make her his dog again later, and he didn’t want to complicate things. <br />
<br />
Sally was already looking through the options. She can’t believe her luck. Jeff hadn’t chosen an animal that was going to be somewhat helpless, certainly none threatening, and very much her own adorable first pet. “Ok, let me see what we can do for you…”<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised and a little bit impressed that she was navigating the Chronivac so quickly. Only a few minutes before she’d been a dog after all. Did this mean the machine was going to have a similar power for him….? <br />
<br />
“You have some options. Which type of hamster would you like to be? Dwarf, Syrian, or Chinese?”<br />
<br />
“I think Hammy was Syrian, let’s go with that. He was orange and white in colour.”<br />
<br />
“Ok. And how much of a change would you like? What about your gender?”<br />
<br />
“I think a change of species will be dramatic enough for a first transformation. I will stay male.”<br />
<br />
Sally had other options to prepare too. She decided to allow him to retain 50% of his human mind. Certainly this must have been less of a change than her own mind had undergone. But she wanted to see how some of his new humanity took to his new shape. She therefore allowed him full awareness too. She’d been typing and clicking over this time, and by the time she finished she had his new settings prepared: <br />
<br />
Name: Hammy<br />
&#8232;Age: 6 months <br />
Species: Syrian Hamster<br />
 &#8232;Length: 15cm&#8232;<br />
Weight: 120g <br />
Gender: Male &#8232;<br />
Sexual Preference: Straight&#8232;Hair color: orange and white <br />
Mentality: 50% new settings / 50% prior settings <br />
Subject Awareness: On<br />
Reality Adjustment: On <br />
Length of change: 2hours<br />
<br />
“Ok Jeff, hope you’re ready to go!”. She clicked start, and a loading bar started ticking away. She turned around to see Jeff said nervously on the bed. Wearing jeans, t-shirt, and jumper, she’d worried it might be a bit of a weight to burry a new hamster in. Besides, she wanted to be able to see all his changes too. “I think you better take off your clothes. I wouldn’t you to get lost within them”<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn’t sure what he thought about Sally seeing him naked. But she had wandered into his bedroom or the bathroom before at some improper moments. Maybe this wasn’t too different. And he fully undressed. <br />
<br />
Sally was a little annoyed she had not waited longer to set the program off. Seeing Jeff like this, especially as he turned around to face her, his clothes now a neat pile beside him, she would have liked to enjoy his human form…. “Unfortunately I don’t have time to enjoy you like this”, she giggles, “but I will give you one kiss”. She leant over and kissed you on the cheek. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt things stirring a bit. But whether that was the affects of the kiss or the start of the transformation it was hard to tell. Before he could respond with a touch of his own he noticed some initial changes… Including a tinkling sensation across his skin, as small hairs started to grow. There was something of a sinking sensation in his stomach too…<br />
<br />
“Oh, your ears!” Sally mouthed silently. Or at least that’s how it seemed to Jeff. As his ears were going through some reshaping to two small round disks a top his head, until sound rushed back to him, with greater clarity and sensitivity then before.<br />
<br />
“My hearing is already different Sally. And… I think my smell too.” As Jeff spoke his nose stretched out a little too, whiskers sprouting along it’s side. <br />
<br />
But as well as his own changes. The room was changing too. The wallpaper was shifting to a pink colour. And some of his own items were fading away. <br />
<br />
“I put the reality shift on” Sally explained. “Just in case anything interrupts us, they will think you are my pet. Which must mean this is my room now” She looked around with a smile. <br />
<br />
Jeff was wondering if Sally was doing a little too much for a temporary transformation. The room was even starting to get bigger too. Until he saw that Sally too was growing, and realised that it was in fact himself that was shrinking. <br />
<br />
Light fur was now covering more of his body. He looked down to see the white and orange pattern cover his chest. And his penis becoming a lump hidden within it. <br />
<br />
His hand ached, as his thumb receded slightly. But otherwise his five fingers remained. While fur was starting to cover his arms, he could flex his fingers, and hands seemed to remain free and dexterous. <br />
<br />
He looked up, and Sally seemed even taller. He was loosing centimetres faster now. A charged sensation through his body as his centre of gravity was shifting. <br />
<br />
“You’re going to be my beautiful little boy”, she said, gazing at you. “I just love your fur already. More colourful then mine was. How does it feel?”.<br />
<br />
“It feels…. comfortable”, Jeff replied. Although surprised at the higher pitch it was taking on. Showing that sense of surprise, he emitted his first squeak. And Sally’s smile widened.<br />
<br />
But as well as size, his vision of her was changing. His eyes diminished into two black dots. While Jeff was discovering the rush of heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch, he was discovering a hamster’s poorer vision. If that was to matter. His environment was compensating by bringing him closer to the floor, and struggling to maintain his balance for any longer he fell forward. His hands taking his fall. Absorbing the shock in a different way as his arms shrank more into his body. <br />
<br />
He was now on 4 legs, as changes continued taking hold. His body shifted in length and shape, while becoming smaller by the second. His legs shifted to support his new stance, and a small stubby tail stretched out behind. <br />
<br />
He hadn’t anticipated to be quite so overwhelmed with a hamsters instincts for self preservation, and fear at being in completely new surroundings. With the final moments of his transformation, he shrank down to a size smaller than Sally’s foot. The machine really worked on him too, and while he really wanted to inhale and absorb being this new creature in a now ginormous room, he couldn’t stop shaking. Sally takes him in her hands. “It’s ok my little one. You’re ok with me”<br />
<br />
She gently kisses his head and strokes his body with one finger, seeing that this slowed the trembling. “I’ll call you Hammy. It’s what you wanted. It suites you well too”<br />
<br />
Jeff would have felt that Sally was getting very into this role play. But he was too preoccupied with own state. His head hurt, as hamster instincts were fighting for space with a human way of thinking. But Sally’s touch was soothing, as he allowed himself to relax into it. He began to take in the room… It was going to be an interesting evening.</p>
